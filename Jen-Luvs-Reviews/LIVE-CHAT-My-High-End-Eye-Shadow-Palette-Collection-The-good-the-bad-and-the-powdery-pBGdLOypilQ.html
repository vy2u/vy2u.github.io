pallete collection video I have a bit
over here I'm actually going to take the
camera off of the computer so if you get
dizzy easily you're about to move so
look away for a quick second I'm gonna
try not to keep you all right I'm gonna
show you that is an entire bin of
eyeshadow palette there may be some
other palettes and they're thrown in but
I took I just took all my lash out of
palettes frantically in the past three
minutes there's some stuff on the floor
excuse that didn't realize that was
there and then that's the bin there's my
foot let me show you how big it is
compared to my hands so that is full of
eyeshadow palettes that we're going to
talk about today so I'm gonna go ahead
and movie again up to the computer so
please excuse as I move you yes so I'm
very excited about today's chat I think
it's gonna be a lot of fun different
eyeshadow palettes what I use when I
don't use why I use them why I don't use
them and when I look for in an eyeshadow
palette but before we get into all that
I'm gonna take just a moment to say
hello to the collective brain of makeup
awesome it's also known as the chat
window scrolling by me they're gonna
chime in on their opinions of the
palettes and we're just gonna have a big
old conversation and learn from each
other because what works for me is an
eyeshadow palette may not work for you
and what works for you may not work for
me so having the collective brain
involved in this helps the viewer to
understand what may or may not work and
when we all kind of have look at my
frizzy hair today this is like straight
out of the shower and no hair done
anyway so though so what we all come
through together will kind of give you a
really good idea of whether and I chose
palette is truly good or not in the
collective brain agrees with me then
chances are it's a pretty general
consensus that it's either really good
or really not good so let me go ahead
and greet them very quickly I haven't
even opened the window yet this time I
have to make sure that I pause my voice
because I did not do that last week all
right there we go so I'm gonna go ahead
and scroll up to the very tip top and
say hello to the very first people that
were here hello Lee and she says good
morning I haven't been able to catch the
chat in several weeks
I feel out of the loop that's a good
thing about chatez even if you miss it
one week it's not like you really missed
anything that's like in a series you
know like it's like you miss part one
and I jumping in on part two we do a new
topic every week so it works out pretty
well
good morning Vicki good morning Gina
good morning Maria good morning to Liz
and Stephanie she said she just finished
what's up and makeup on double speed
whoo I can't even imagine overwhelming
good morning to Ida and to Stephanie
fizzy pop good morning Depot good
morning oh good evening Deepa I
apologize it is not morning for Deepa it
is evening for Deepa
good morning Diana and Melissa Emma and
hmm pancakes is back I'm hoping I'm

let's see Jenna hello and Keiji hello
Sara good morning listening at work
don't get caught
Snape's honey good morning and I'm
excited for the peach palette and
Melissa wants to know if anybody's
excited for Peach Belt it's gonna be
awesome it's gonna be awesome and I'm so
excited and I cannot wait to get my
hands on it and I can't wait to smell it
so exciting so exciting
good morning to Amanda and is that it
Kathy all right we're gonna go ahead and
scroll down and Christy good morning
we're gonna scroll all the way down if I
did not say good morning to you I am
saying good morning to you now or good
evening if you live in your deepa all
right no let's go ahead and start with
high-end and we're gonna work our way to
drugstore so the first one is right on
the top because I just reviewed this
quite a bit is the Too Faced peanut
butter and jelly palette since we're
talking about the sweet peach Mazal talk
about this one this is my biggest
complaint about this watch look at this
what is that what is that why why do you
hate me why look the magnet doesn't even
work anymore look I don't I don't even
understand it's gotten worse and worse I
don't know if maybe it like adjusted or
something with the spring of Justin oh
there we go I bent the spring back a
little bit I kind of pushed it and now
it's it's closing better but still
they need to do something about that
because that's annoying this is an
amazing palette it smells like candy
peanut butter it doesn't smell like like
real peanut butter smells like candy
peanut butter with a little bit of
chocolate thrown in that this is less
this is a great time to talk about what
I look for in an eyeshadow palette it
says take it back what I look for an
eyeshadow palette is exactly what this
palette is there's two major things the
first one I look at is ease of use okay
but to fight with a palette it's just
not worth it to me it's not worth it
because there are product there are
palettes of all price ranges that are
good quality pounds my talk about a good
palette does I'm not talking about price
I'm talking about quality like fruit
quality and you can get some true
quality eyeshadow products for not as
expensive this happens to be a more
expensive palette but let's talk about
quality so I want them to easily blend
but I don't want them to blend away so
you can have really pigmented eyeshadows
but then they don't blend because
they're just so pigmented and they're so
stuck they don't move so you want your
eyeshadows to be able to move you want
them to be able to blend into each other
the second major thing I look for in an
eyeshadow palette is can I get a
complete look out of it so in order to
get a complete look these are the two
things that I have to have in there
really and truly the major things I have
to have some kind of lid color so a
color that has a shade that's close to
my natural skin tone so for here that
would be probably rich and creamy and
soft and sweet those two are my typical
lid colors that I do I'm starting to
experiment with some deeper lip colors
but I want one that's similar to my skin
tone so for someone that's a deeper skin
tone this is gonna be a great palette
because there are quite a few deeper
shades okay so one that's really light I
don't know I should probably be fun
because you have these two and this will
probably go on somebody really like two
so I need that I also need a transition
shade which is a shade maybe two or
three shades deeper than my skin tone so
for me this peanut butter shade or this
nuts about you shape those are going to
be my transition shades okay
are they really like really transition
shade should be cool tones and it should
be matte these two are matte but they're
not really cool tone but you can make it
work there are no hard
set rules with eyeshadow there's there's
guidelines but there's no hard and set
rules so that's that's kind of what I do
when I choose colors now if you have
eyes that are large they kind of pop out
you can really do great things with deep
colors on your lid but if you have small
eyes that are set back what you want to
want to do is you're going to want to
highlight them and you're gonna want to
bring them forward and do a light lid
and that's just the way I learned is you
eye shadows so that's the way that I do
them so that's that's kind of just a
little rundown on what I do in order to
pick a shadow pick an eyeshadow palette
and whether I decide whether it's good
or not so I thought that was important
for you to know before we move on so the
only shade in this it's a little iffy
for me is jelly and I know a lot of
people love jelly I see some comments
about Heather saying how much she loves
jelly jelly is gorgeous but jelly is a
little bit more difficult to work with
than the other shades it's it doesn't
swatch well it goes on the eyes a little
bit better than a swatch but it's just
it's a little harder to work with but
that doesn't cancel out the palate for
me it doesn't care about puff me
palettes fab
alright annai discard pile around what I
didn't so we're going to go with that
alright I pulled these off of my shelf
these are eye shadow palette I don't
reach for very often actually let me
look at the collective brain real quick
and see if there's anything going on
over here Gina says my favorite
transition is in orange so hello peaches
come to mama hehe but I would never say
no to a peanut butter and jelly
Nikki says that's the only good exciting
shade in peanut butter and jelly you
talking about the jelly shade it's
harder to work with though Nikki it's
harder to work with Chrissy says she
needs jelly Joanne says hi gorgeous
can't see LEM wanted to say that I tried
carroty carroty shadows and OMG they're
worth it got to go grandma duties
calling have a great day have a great
day Jo we have thanks for sharing that
with us today
all right Nicole says I have one to face
palette and I don't love the
pigmentation so I haven't gotten any
others trying to side if I want the
chocolate bar or chocolate bonbons
I have heard they're equal in quality
I've heard that you can cotta go your
way that the quality is pretty much the
same in either one here's mine
it should say it's a shadow here all I
need is call
I shadow and I'm good to go I needed
that
he's lost an hour last night and I lost
an hour all right so anyway all right so
this is the Urban Decay vice palette
this is the vice for I believe I never
reach for this like ever like ever ever
never ever I put it up on my shelf cuz I
never reach for it it's so pretty it's
so pretty and I thought for the Vice
strap every time a lot of people really
love the vice palette but that all of
ice palettes but for me the big fail
here is in the color selection this is
this is very difficult for me to work
with to put together a look it's just
kind of crazy and all over the place
it's really difficult for me to handle
it's got some shades that have some fall
out like this shade lo you can tell an
urban decay shadow whether it's not fall
out or not I need something to cover
this up you put this up here this is the
dirtiest eyeshadow palette I don't use
it anymore but you know I'll show you
that one in a minute so like this shade
right here lo is very gritty and it's
got that's how you can tell if you see
it with an urban decay eyeshadow you see
that grit in there chances are you're
gonna get some fallout so this one this
one this one and this one and this one I
can tell right away probably gonna get
me fallout but if foam that doesn't
bother you and you can work with this I
just feel like with Urban Decay vice
palettes just overall they're not for
beginners they're for people that
already know what they're doing have a
big place to put their you know their
thoughts and you find me no I'm saying I
started reading a comment and I lost my
train of thought but like they know how
to put a look together that's who this
is for it's not a bad palette it's just
really hard to work with so that's kind
of this vice palette so I have this one
this is the three or this is a poor
doesn't say on here but I'm pretty sure
this is the hoard this is the original
vice palette this I don't use anymore
this is old but this was I have a video
on this this is my one of my first big
purchases when I got my channel again
the same kind of issue is just all over
the stick in place all over the single
place voice
- is that what this is - three three
maybe maybe it's the three let's try
again all over the single place I even
have the brush in here I should bring
the brush out the brushes you swamp Rock
down just shadows all over the single
place man
just all over the place and you know you
look at any deep shades there are like
these are great for deeper skin tones
man look all those beautiful deep shade
it makes me say these things just
they're pretty for display I'm just
gonna I'm just gonna let him go it
frustrate me so I really want to know
what the collective brain thinks of the
vice palette 7ea says lay off the vice
gen she must be a vice vice fan analyst
says I just don't like how the vice
pouts aren't cohesive at all agree agree
Becca says the Vice three is quite nice
that says I agree vices are for
experience make uppers the hand cake
says I did just get 5io she's I'm a
Natasha Geneva pallet and she was
disappointed oh man
and Nicki says the vices are okay but I
definitely pull for a pop of color over
a whole look yeah and it's just one of
those things where I just feel like it's
just I don't know like they're just
difficult and I don't have time for that
most days time for that most Diana says
I've three but not before I like the
packaging though so Jenna says send them
to me well these are so old girlfriend
they're so old it's like I'm gonna I'm
gonna do something at some point my
stuff gets a good home but then the
thing is is it's nice to have these as a
reviewer because then if I want to do a
dupes video I can pull these out and I
can say well this is a dupe for Urban
Decay's whatever so as a reviewer like I
know they just sit but it's really
important to me to have a bunch of
pallets so that I can do videos so once
I have once I'm off work I'll be able to
do more videos like that so alright
vice four is on sell for $39 Gina says
she thinks she doesn't have one too loud
from me alright so anyway so that's the
voice pellets now the time at the boys
pallets
talk about a little bit about the Urban
Decay Naked palette pull this out and do
you I want all of them because I got
them I got the vault see if I can find
them all it should all be in here can I
find it on quickly that's the question
it should all be here on top all right
they probably aren't okay so anyway
let's see Oh where's my original book my
original you could tell it original okay
so I have here the negative The Naked 3
I've been naked smoking then I have the
naked basics and the basics - do you
want the original one I was using it one
day and I think it just got misplaced
you look right here real quick because I
just had the original naked for now you
guys have seen it a million times anyway
it's not like it's something new all
right so I have a special place in my
heart for the Urban Decay Naked 2 very
special place in my heart because my
ordering here either I'm gonna run out
of batteries soon okay let's talk about
these and then I'm gonna go run get my
charger real quick well text my husband
or bringing my charger I'll text him
okay so anyway naked - there's a special
place in my heart for this because this
was the first high-end eyeshadow palette
that I bought and this kind of inspired
needs to be able to do makeup because of
the ease of use it is so stinkin easy to
use my booty call fell out just so you
know that's supposed to mean booty call
in there it's a very light color and my
booty call fell out so you know it
happens sometimes I guess the booty
calls falling so it's just the ease of
use and the blend ability it was the
first eyeshadow palette I ever bought
that had ease of use and blend ability
and it was like oh so if you never tried
an eyeshadow palette that's not a
typical drugstore collet I definitely
recommend getting one whether it's this
whether it's you know the the Too Faced
chocolate bar palette something
because you'll see on right away that
there is a big difference between a
typical drugstore pill and I'm not
saying all the drugstore pills but a
typical drugstore pellet and the ease of
use and blend ability of these shadows
it changes your whole perspective on
makeup so I always wonder like when
somebody oh man it's already dying okay
one minute I have to text my husband
real quick hold on instead of running
out of here
hold on two seconds sorry guys my
computer charger okay all right texted
him hopefully he comes quickly if not
I'm gonna have to run out okay yes okay
you ever wondered we have to check and
see if I text the right person so
there's a special place in my heart for
this because it really is something that
was very very easy for me to use so
there you go game changer Beth says yes
game changer for her too and then Jackie
says I really like the Little Rock Pro
for me
yeah I'm 15 that's really good some a
beginner there you go exactly the way
you look at things the Urban Decay Naked
3 you know a lot of people love this I
really think it has to do a lot with
your skin tone I don't even use the
brush that's in here but I think it has
a lot to do with your skin tone and
whether rosy shades look good on you and
whether you enjoy using rosy shades I
mean this one is not one that I use
super often but I do really like it a
lot it's enjoyable to use these abuse is
definitely their color selection is a
little off for me in that there's so
much rose there's so much Rose that it's
hard to get a look that for me at least
it's hard for me to get a look that's
not mushy because in a palette you
really want some contrast as well
alright
you
okay hopefully we're back let's see let
me look and see are we back
sorry about that guys hopefully I'm
hoping I'm hoping cuz I logged me on in
a different way so I'm hoping we're
there refresh this hoping we're there
I'm hoping sorry guys
that was my fault my bad okay go okay
there we go alright you know it doesn't
matter how well you feel like you
prepare there's always something that I
forget I need a checklist and the
problem is is that I get such such
little sleep on Sunday night Saturday
nights and last night was worse because
I lost an hour so anyway if I'm frozen
go out and come back if there's an issue
with the quality of it just go out and
come back alright the quality idea is
much better now nice good okay that's
great so we were talking about the Urban
Decay palettes we'll talk about the
minute for the original eyeshadow
palette the original eyeshadow palette
from me is very similar and what I like
of the original naked naked 2 ease of
use color range blend ability all of
that complete palette just all of it is
just wonderful for me so I could go one
way it's just kind of whether I want
warm or cool I'll reach for the naked 1
or the naked to the naked smoky is one
that again I don't reach for that often
it's a very very nice palette honestly I
reach for the on the revealed smokey
like I could do one or the other like
they both do the same thing for me the
only thing this one makes me feel
fancier I feel different than this
packaging is beautiful it's so pretty
it's so pretty so I do probably reach
for this just a little bit more just
because the packaging is pretty but I
can do the revealed smoky palette like
interchangeably with this it's pretty
much the same same thing so yes very
nice very nice and you can see there's a
a range of deep to lighter shades so and
that also makes it nice for all people
all different skin tones - all right
let's talk about the difference between
the naked basics and the naked - so the
naked basics I feel like was like their
first try and then the naked 2 was naked
basics - was like oh we understand we
kind of need more than let's see four
colors in this thing because these
shades are very very very similar and
they just kind of did overkill on the
light shades so you've got black you got
dark brown you've got a lighter brown
and you've got three very light shades I
don't know what they were thinking
originally for that this one is more of
a peach tone this is a yellow tone and
then this is a shimmery tone but it's
like locked walk so then what they did
was they went to the naked basics - and
they were like aha maybe we should make
it like a variant of tone let's go from
dark really dark to dark to medium it's
a little lighter - a little lighter to
light and this is this was what they
should have done this is what they
should have done so let's see Jackie
wants to know what my thoughts are on
the color Creek in the naked one
honestly like I can't even run which one
that is how terrible is that like I'm
sitting here thinking like I'm supposed
to know about all these palettes and I
can't even think what Creek looks like
if I could look it up on my phone if I
had next thing I'd look at it but in my
mind I can't even remember what it looks
like but I know I can tell you there
isn't a single shade in the naked
original Naked palette that makes me
upset they all work for me so Holly says
zero interests in the basics I feel like
looking for a look for work or for
school
and you want something that's very
simple that is you know very just not
attention-getting at all I really would
recommend the naked basics - this is
very simple basic easy to use so it's
the basics and that's that's what you're
getting with this another thing that
this is nice for is having on the side
to go with something crazy because if
you've got this paired with your vice
palette you can do anything you
you want with these two you know what I
mean like some no it's nice to have it
it's nice to have it me a says the
basics are perfect for every day totally
agree Holly says yes true Jed and they
list so that she uses it with other
palettes Tania says watch Shan shortcake
beauty from makeup revolution dupes
they're also and you know I don't know I
mean it will open some to for comparison
purposes I'm Sarah says to me the basics
basics it's a companion palette
absolutely absolutely
so I'm gonna go ahead and one here I
think this is still available this is
the Stila eyes are the window shadow
palette and this is the one in spirit
this is kind of their best of palette
you can find us sometimes on sale with
Nordstrom calm things like that would
highly recommend it this is like the
steal of greatest hits palette you have
so many great shades including kitten
and puppy those are wonderful shades
those are me see puppy is kittens up
here and puppies over here just
wonderful shades and this one kind of
reminds me of the Mannie and you a shade
down here I don't have that palette but
the one that everybody was raving about
that maroon shape this one really
reminds me of that a lot as soon as I
look at it I think about Manny
anyway palette so really really really
love this palette I love how it goes
from deep to medium to light I mean just
perfectly design very easy to work with
lots of mattes and shimmers you have one
two three months out formats and then
you have a lot of satins and shimmers
but no sparkle so it's just really
really really nice yes they you have a
shade called poppy it's right here it's
right there it's just a nice transition
color for my skintone it may be a nice
lid color for some people I don't know
if you can see it because it's very
close to my skin tone it's just a tiny
bit darker but yeah it's gorgeous here's
the one that I think looks like the
Manny anyway palette and then kids might
be a little redder than that but very
very nice and that one is called Pig Dom
I think P IG al le I don't know I'm
sorry I didn't have time to look it up
but yeah so this is just a wonderful
palette if you can get your hands on it
as far as sealer eyeshadow
on the whole I would definitely be where
it's very similar to Iraq and that they
have two distinct formulas they have a
cheap formula and they have a nice
formula the cheap formula is really
really really bad
really really really powdery I got rid
of all my other sealer palettes except
for this one because they were terrible
so just be careful with sila palettes
especially when they come in let those
little cardboard containers they seem to
be really really bad so just be careful
of that please but this this is a really
really nice palette this whole
collection I heard is very very good let
me look in the collective brain Holly
says kitten is perfect traces as any
release date for the peach palette st.
Patrick's Day is when it's coming out
Anita says I love the patty de bras
perfect palette coffee break mcdaniel
you buy it I don't know anything about
that palette I'll have to look it up
Brianna says the peach but she's given
the peach palette yes okay all right
this is one I don't use ever and I
really need to start using it because
it's a fantastic palette I don't know it
gets better heed the obscene look at
this I'm not sure if you know if this
that is Samantha Reilly's signature
right there I don't know if you notice
Samantha Riley on YouTube speaking of
coffee break with Danny she's best
friends with coffee break with Dan Sam
and I have been YouTube acquaintances
for quite a while we're not we're
definitely not pressed we're
acquaintances we're very friendly
we met at I'm I'm Matt I'm Matt to New
York last year and she is such a
sweetheart so this was the pout she
designed with serenity and Scott it
doesn't have her name on it or anything
but man did she do a fantastic job with
this power I'm not even kidding like
such a one hotel I convinced Kathy from
thrift ed when I met Kathy there to buy
one of these as well I was like you've
got to swatch this thing you've got a
swatch this thing and I literally took
Cassie's arm and I dragged her over to
the booth and I was like just watch it
just put your fingers in it and Cassie
bought it and ended up being in her
favorites video at the top of her
pyramid one month and I was like yes
because I felt good she bought something
on my recommendation that she really
ended up loving so anyway so this
palette is just really really wonderful
unfortunately Sorrenti and scott
eyeshadows are extremely expensive and i
probably won't buy anymore just because
of the price point so but if you're ever
in the market and you ever want one you
can definitely I would recommend
surrending in Scottish a doze at least
based on this power
I need to move this to the front because
I haven't used this in a really long
time and it's really wonderful it really
is I just wish they'd knock their prices
down just a little bit like that pallet
I think it's like 50 bucks or something
that's crazy
so alright moving on let me see-oh
tartlet tartlet Mads any thoughts about
anyone I have the toilet in here
Veronica sent it to me
you see it's I think it's very oh here
we go there's my naked
let's find creep creep I don't use it I
don't use it very much it's the glittery
black I don't use it because it's dark
and I don't use a lot of blacks in my
looks because I'm mostly doing work
looks so yeah I don't really use creep
so that's my opinion on that it looks
like it would have some fallout as well
as gunmetal they both look like they
would have fallout but I don't know so
yes alright so I think it's very so
we'll get there I don't know we might
have to do two of these because it's
10:30 and I only got into the drugstore
stuff yet so we might do this one as
high ends and then the next one is drug
source that we can get to all the things
actually spend time on them instead of
having to rush so the next thing I
wanted to talk to you guys about is the
rock pro pallets I do have the original
mega Pro and the reason why I've found
out about this is because one of my
friends on Instagram she said that this
was on Amazon and I jumped and I got it
and I felt so lucky to get it this one
the original lorac mega Pro is so so so
much better than than the second one
just the color selection when it comes
down to his color selection this is a
really really wonderful wonderful color
selection there's everything you could
possibly want in this thing and you
could possibly want like in my opinion
to create a very nice beautiful look I
mean there's a lot of course there's no
bright greens or break blues and things
like that but this is like oh such a
wonderful every day a wonderful everyday
palette now this the thing about this
was the release of this if you remember
if you we're into makeup back then the
release of this was horrible was
absolutely a horrible like they they
must have had like hundred of these
things it was horrible it was
they released this and I felt so
fortunate that I was able to grab one
like I remember my heart was beating as
always on Amazon with it in my card I
was like please let me get it please get
it and I did and I just still can't
believe it I still can't so let us talk
about this one because this one's a
little more accessible I'm pretty sure
this is still on sale this isn't lorac
mega pro 2 it's just not as epic as far
as color selection the quality is still
the same no the quality is still
fabulous
the only thing about lorac shadows is
they do tend to be a bit powers you have
to make sure you top off your brush
you're gonna end up with eyeshadow all
over your face so don't smash your brush
in them you got to be really gentle with
them because they're very very very soft
so the other thing about this one is
there's no taupe and I need a taupe I'm
like Kristin game I need a taupe in my
life there's no taupe the closest to a
transition shade that I've gotten here
is tawny and I wish they had put just a
little more of that like they've got the
shimmery one sandstone but I wish that
they had sandstone in a matte form and
then I'd be super happy like getting rid
of one of these over here they overdid
it on these light shades kind of like
the the Urban Decay original Naked
basics palette they overdid it on with
my shades and they should have done more
transition scenes that's my opinion but
quality wise it's amazing quality wise
it's amazing in my opinion alright Sarah
says I got the original mega Pro and I
love it skip the two because the colors
weren't appealing to me I totally feel
you on that Krista says I hate daylight
savings I'm Glade that's okay Chris I
still love you
Kaneesha says lorac shadows are my
favorite I have all their palettes Gina
says when lorac will release the pro I
was only one week old on YouTube and you
were and all and you all were killing me
Holly says no taupe no and Jenna says
thanks Anisha okay you guys are talking
to each other Nicole says Tony and
burlap or great transition shade but the
problem is is that they're very very
very very warm and there's nothing wrong
with warm I just really wanted a cool
transition say to am I asking too much
for a cool transition J come on man with
all these light ones they could have
given me a cool transition shade it
could have done it they didn't all right
Stephanie a says
it seemed that for many brands and lines
of pellets the first version of palette
is warm neutral and the second one is
cool toned just me yeah kind of you
think about them like urban decay yeah I
could see that I can see that Chrissy
says I think have Lundy shadows are too
or powdery - if you don't tap them off I
get a mess with my face
totally great totally agree and then
Kaneesha says agree that the Perot -
doesn't have the best color selection
Diana says I like the lorac Pro thin
rectangular ones I do have some of those
I do have some of those speaking of that
let's talk about the rock house that I
own okay so I have the lorac original
Pro I have the pro 2 and I have the Pro
Medal the original Pro I got as a
hand-me-down from my sister-in-law who
did not like it I forget what she said
why she didn't like it but she didn't
like it
and honestly I haven't used it that much
I haven't I haven't used it a whole lot
I don't know why I guess because there's
just been other things that have been a
priority but you know I just I just
haven't used it a whole lot but the
quality is definitely there all of the
lorac Pro palette all have the same
quality now you just got to be careful
about the shadow palettes that are the
ones where they have it's got like a row
of shadows and then it's got like going
this way and then it's got some shadows
going lengthwise and it's like a cheaper
plastic packaging please be careful of
those because those have a very bad
reputation of being very low quality I'm
not saying they're all like that but
that style of palette seems to be a
different formula so just be careful of
that but yeah those lorac Pro works
great love it
here's the lorac Pro - okay this one I
think is a little more difficult to work
with I mean this is going along with
what Stephanie was saying about the warm
versus the cool you know you've got the
warm here you've got mostly cool over
here you've got some warm over there too
but um you know I feel like this one is
probably shade range wise a little
easier to work with this one's a little
more fun you know laughs and a little
bit more fun but yeah I really enjoy
both of them
they're both great palettes when I first
got this I use distinct out of it but
when I first got it this right here the
lorac Pro metal is a supplemental
palette this is not a palette that's a
good standalone power it
just using one of these as like a
one-and-done I shadow color these are
gorgeous
they're wonderful very metallic just
beautiful like that we look just really
gorgeous you see if I can get a good
swatch over here and up all swatched up
by the end of this okay so there you go
just that field look very nice very I
don't know if this is still available I
think it might be I got this I want to
say last summer but it's very very nice
we definitely recommend this one I use
this this cobalt the other day with like
a silvery kind of shade like I use it's
like a lighter silvery shade all over
the lid and then I pop this in the outer
corner and it was so pretty so pretty so
pro formula I do have something that
other palettes I think they're very I
would find them in a bit thank you I
think they're barely but we'll get back
there we'll get there
alright I think a lot of them are buried
underneath the Kat Von D palace here we
go here's another lorac one that I own
this is the mint condition
mint collection this one I never reach
for I don't know why it's a very nice
palette I've heard people don't like
this palette I liked it I really enjoyed
it I was very happy to have it but I
don't reach for it often I think I've
now that it's spring I need to bring
this back to the front of my collection
so did I use it more because it is fun
this mint shade is so fun it's so fun I
mean it's such a fun shade and I'm
looking at now because it's been a year
since I've used it that it may be a
little difficult to work with I don't
remember it being difficult to work with
but I had to do dope swatches there so I
don't know Diana says the unzipped gold
is almost an I've heard both the unzip
palettes are great this one is a very
nice palette though this one I remember
going on sale on hold looking so seafoam
be able to get that one anymore
alright let me make sure there's nothing
else like this I know I have they
probably just fell down at the bottom so
the camera is a palettes that are the
big ones that are good ones for me this
was from two years ago I
tear how old this thing's gets I'm not
getting rid of it I don't care if it's
ten years old this thing is never going
to go away I had so much fun with this
eyeshadow book when I first got this is
the spellbinding eyeshadow book I think
this came out two Christmases ago and
the idea behind this is that you're
supposed to pair these up so you pair
either up the duo or you can pair the
quad and use it as a look and it's just
really fun it was just so creative how
she put this together and I've used them
as quads and they're so so stinking fun
so fun you can layer them over top of
each other and create a completely
different shade like if I share these
two I put them so if I take those two
all right let me see if I can put them
here on my wrist and I put them separate
and then if I put them together I know
it seems really weird to put them
together but that's the shape together
and I would probably put a little more
gold on there but it turns into like a
tle kind of green so you're supposed to
be able to do that as well to layer them
on top of each other to create a
completely different look and I just
thought it was so stinking creative and
they're very easy to use very blendable
you know I just I really love this
palette so and then let's see oh
illusion fan one says what wvu I am
expands for what's up in makeup so if
you ever see that acronym Julie says I
trust makeup coming from you guys more
than from any random person me too and
that's why I love the ones in the makeup
app and what simple makeup Facebook
community because we can all learn from
each other and there's so much knowledge
in this room right now in this chat room
like people that are watching on the
replay people that are in the collective
brain like there's so much knowledge in
this room because just because people
don't make youtube videos doesn't mean I
don't know about makeup and I think
that's a big misconception that a lot of
people do not give Watchers of makeup
videos nearly enough credit because I
know that the people watching my videos
probably know a heck of a lot more than
I do
I'm just the pastor on of information
I'm just the face but I get a lot of my
information from my community I'd like
to call my community community our
community all right maybe it'll oka
maybe logo love it I love it so much and
the thing is this is the scariest
palette that I love that's the best
thing in it but it's the scariest
element that I love because got all
these bright insane shapes I cannot wait
to Ralphie's in the summertime some of
these brighter shades just so fun what
Kat Von D did with this it's so stinking
genius putting this wheel in here of
neutral colors was stinking genius
because what she did was she made this a
complete palette by doing that she
didn't just do it was where is it no
don't lose it my point my point is lost
it's like it's hard to turn s up put to
the side not only miss the quality of
both these shadows is very good but if
you look at this this is a supplemental
palette there's no way you're ever gonna
be putting create a look that's like a
daytime wearable look for any typical
person with this this is insane this
palette is crazy but if you look with
Kat Von D did she made it wearable
she took similar bright shades and she
made wearable
stinking genius she's genius
unbelievable like really
so can't rave about this enough I wish
it was still available I wish that she
would I mean I know the spectrum palette
is still available but I don't think
that it's got what this has got this
this was a whole nother level of
Awesomeness oh yes I know stephanie says
UDT needs to start taking notes from Kat
Von D on how to lay out of palette
totally agree
Tracy says I bought me butyl looking for
my niece's Christmas and she doesn't
like it give it back to me there haha
but seriously someone else would love it
and then it is too if you don't know how
to work this you know you might not
realize how to use those milkshakes
maybe she doesn't know how to use them
maybe teaching her how to you should say
hey have you tried doing this this and
this with it because maybe she just
doesn't know how to use it you know cuz
you got to know how to work this one but
is it fabulous we're going to get
electric power
like I said so incredibly pigmented I do
find this a little difficult to work it
because the pigmentation is so insane
it's it's it's the point where they're
not quite blendable for me at least
they're just so they're so incredibly
bright it's workable but it's just a
little difficult a little difficult all
right let's see what has to be gotten
here okay we got 20 minutes left we
might get into a little bit of drugstore
we'll see okay here we go
we'll help some more okay we've got a
lot of good stuff in here this is so sad
how many pallets I have it's insane
okay speaking of Kat Von D this is the
Kat Von D is not the monarch this is the
chrysalis palette this is now this
continued as well this was a really fun
palette I love the color shade range in
here it's very very nice very fun to
work with this one reminds me of that
lorac pro metal blue the cobalt very fun
to use I love I love the deep the deep
on the outside and the lighter in the
middle with the silver I mean just so
fun such a fun palette really enjoyable
Christian Lee 314 excellent YouTube
channel good morning my friend good to
see you all right and super quiche says
is anyone planning on getting any of the
new mini Kat Von D shade of like mini
palettes I'm gonna wait for reviews
because I don't trust Kat Von D anymore
how sad is that I don't trust it anymore
I've had two fails now will not fail I
had one fail in the blushes the do duo
blushes and a possible fail on the new
eyeshadow primer I won't use it once
though but I'm not I'm not hopeful I'm
not hopeful on that so I'm a little
nervous about Kat Von D now I think that
something's going on either she's being
influenced by other people other people
are taking over her brand or something I
don't know but something's going on with
her something's going on all right
Brianna wants to know if the elf mad
format palette it's good it is good ease
of use is there um color selection is
there lasting power is not there just so
you know I do have a video if you search
my videos for elf you'll find the
reviews of all of those palettes in
swatches and dupes and all that stuff
this is another old kat von d palette
that I own is called sinner this one I
never reached for this one we need to
pass on
somebody because this one has way too
many dark shades in it it's way too many
dark shades there's not enough balance I
think they improved on this in the
chrysalis you can kind of see where they
went this is the old version and then
this is the new version this one's so
much better so much better so Diana says
that she pulled the duo blushes were
talking about and I'm not surprised and
she should I mean I don't know maybe
they had to let them go I don't know
what happened behind the scenes but
those things were bad the advertising
was really cute though but they were bad
alright Anna says what I wanted to say
is that if I'm going I'm going out Mike
wait I got a scroll per minute it's
gonna disappear what I wanted to say is
if I'm gonna out put color on my lid
it's never gonna be one of those
ordinary colors from those palettes if
you know what I mean it has to be
gorgeous probably shimmering colors
something really special and it's hard
to find those special shades that really
call to you and I guess the best advice
I would have to you if you would ask for
it I don't know if you are would be to
just watch a lot of lots of reviews man
and see those colors that call to you
and then go after a man because it
sounds like you're very hard to please
alright another palette that I got on a
whim I think at Nordstrom Rack this is a
the ammo palette there's a couple of
them that are exactly the same palette
but there have different names I think
this is called the ammo palette from
urban decay this is another one I don't
reach for my sister-in-law swears by
this when she says that it's amazing for
her that she reaches for it all the time
I have a lot of trouble working with
this because it's all shimmer shades and
I just don't reach for it a whole lot
but I'm very happy that I have it
because it does have a lot of really
famous urban decay shades in and it's
got smog and they'll do oil slick last
call a chopper sin you know lots of
really good stuff so the only thing is
is there is a lot of fun with this you
just have to be careful but you can find
this sometimes at norstrom rack and
stuff for like 10 15 bucks but it's
difficult to work with just because the
color selection for me alright so now
Lissa's still on Kat Von D's website
Steph says awesome the ammo is nice for
linen shade nikki says agreed agreed
alright so one thing that I miss we were
talking about to face is the chocolate
bar palette this is someone had asked
and I didn't get a chance to answer
because I was the middle of a sentence
and then I forgot what my Holy Grail
palette is and it's the chocolate bar
palette by Too Faced I've said this
before and I'll say it once again
if I were going to be reborn as an
eyeshadow palette it would be the Too
Faced chocolate bar palette this is the
most me palette that ever existed the
shades in here are so unique they are
there are some typical shades in here
don't get me wrong but there are some
shades in here that you just can't find
anywhere else and the big ones in here
that I'm talking about are creme brulee
and champagne truffle those two are
stinking amazing now I've had issues
with candied violet and then it turns
gray on me when I put it on my leg
that's the biggest one in here that I
don't like is candied violet but other
than that I've really had great luck
with these shadows and really enjoyed it
and especially since it smells so
amazing when you open it oh if you love
my honest reviews diva makeup queen
excellent thorough honest reviews if you
like my channel you will love her
channel I just had to give her a quick
shout out because she is stinking
amazing like I'm not even kidding she's
amazing and I'm speaking joke here
palette swing I was actually uh applying
your palates next there right there like
next so I'm gonna hold on to those for
just a quick second I'll consider your
high-end palettes we're gonna put them
in the high-end category because you are
amazing and they're amazing pilots and
I'm not just saying that because wing is
here I've said this multiple times
before we get to wings palettes we're
going to talk about the Sela in the
Garden palette you can find this on sale
some places this is another steal
palette that is very very good very easy
to use just really really nice palette I
love the shade breeze here it's kind of
typical but it's really fun to use got
these deeper shades to kind of balance
it out and it's just a very nice palette
nectar is a wonderful matte cream shade
and then you've got this layer Shenoy
shenoy is actually in the other sila cop
that I mentioned the eyes to the windows
of the spirit Alec Shenoy is in that
there as well I'm just really wonderful
I love this sage I use sage not that
long ago and
and I really like it it's just kind of a
multi light green wonderful wonderful
palette this right here I do have this
little lorac eyeshadow palette this was
in a set that I gave away a lot of the
little palettes in a giveaway I have
kind of split them up and gave them to a
bunch of people but I did keep this one
this one is in toffee crunch and this
was another really good eye shadow
palette I need to move this one to the
front because it's too beautiful to have
not have been used that much but I don't
think you can get this anymore so we're
gonna go ahead and pop that one down now
let's get in the wings palettes all
right diva make up Queen check these out
isn't she beautiful look at that so
beautiful so if you're looking to
support an indie brand I would
definitely recommend going over and
getting these and when I'm telling you
they were next they were right on the
top it's not just cuz you're here
alright so this is the original and I I
feel like this one is kind of like your
basic set like right here is all you
need to create kind of like the Naked
basics all you need to create a
beautiful look right here then you've
got these a little bit of fun over here
but if you really want to make it
Compton this one here the holiday
palette I don't know if it's still
available but if it is jump on it
because these shades are amazing I don't
know why she works her magic it's like
it's like when I talked about Samantha
Riley when you picked shadows I don't
know how they do it but they really did
a fantastic job picking these so that
you can create so many gorgeous looks so
when you use this in comparison with
this I mean in comparison in conjunction
with this you've got all of your mat
like staple shades here and then you've
got your fun you know you've got the fun
over on the side there and you've got
extra plon over here excellent excellent
quality let me just do a little bit of
swatch in here for you and they're
amazing they're absolutely amazing we'll
do it with one of the matte ones over
here all right hopefully let me switch
over to the view so that I can make sure
you can see these and then the other
thing about these two is that they are
there in Z palette so if you end up
wanting to switch something out you can
always do that alright so there you go
there's the diva makeup Queen ones right

high-quality

in there because it was awesome so
they're really really good it's diva
makeup queen is her channel I honestly

original dream big palette is 29.99 so
there you go okay let me flip back over
to you guys okay so there we go
let's go ahead and go I move online so
Thank You wing you were awesome go ahead
and go into a corner and then we do
drugstore next week because these are
important art like palette I found it
chocolate palette okay this is my honest
opinion of the tartlet palette okay I
use this six or seven times and these
shades money together so bad on me the
pigmentation so bad on me they're just
it doesn't work for me I hate it I don't
like I hate that I don't like it because
my friend of Veronica sent it to me who
is one of it she's put she's a peril of
she is in the app community and she was
kind enough to send us to me and I think
the reason why she sends me is because
she didn't like it but now I'm so
thankful that she did send it because
then I can say that I tried it and I can
say I don't like it it just doesn't work
for me and you know tart shadows have
not worked for me for a very long time
this is not the first her eyes shadow
palette that doesn't work for me we're
seen Lea says Charlotte doesn't work for
her either I know some people terribly
love this palette but I don't like it
let me see if I could swatch some for
you may swatch very nice but on the eyes
they just don't work for me and it
upsets me because I want to love it they
swatch pretty nice but on the eye they
just money together I know what's going
on oh my goodness and then Diana says
she's watched us before she wasn't
impressed Emma says I'm over a lot of
Tarte products Melanie says the toilet
pouch don't work for her either Patricia
says what do you think of the Tarte
called the wild cut I think it looks
amazing I haven't swatch it yet I mean
it looks amazing
let's see so that I was not impressed
but I was really sad about that another
one I wanted to show you that it is
really importantly to show you is the
tart tart tart Too Faced sugar pop this
is on sale at Too Faced calm right now I
think for $18 this is such a fun fun fun
fun palette if you like spring colors I
would down ly recommend jumping on the
Too Faced website and looking at this
this is such a fun palette there's
in most of these but it's such a subtle
glitter it's like a matte base with a
tiny bit of glitter thrown in and I am
such a mess right now hopefully I can
get some swatches of some of these I'm
not gonna show you my fingers because my
fingers are such a mess okay they're not
it's hard to see but you see the lighter
shades are showing up on my skin they're
so pigmented the quality reminds me of
the other are two-faced shadows that I
love the quality is just as good as like
say the chocolate bar palette the peanut
butter and jelly palette but it's these
kinds of shades there's lots of
tutorials and looks on it I definitely
recommend before you buy it
Google this palette or look on YouTube
for this palette and see some of the
looks that people have created with this
and see if the visual looks that you
like but oh my gosh it's so amazing i
wing says Jen you're amazing you're so
kind so I couldn't get three before my
website is even makeup queen calm thank
you my friends thank you okay so
definitely recommend that tooth a Sugar
Puffs comment especially since it's on
sale there's a couple more that I
definitely want to mention this one I've
talked about a few times this is the
Becca hombre Rouge eye palette this book
turns into straight mud on me I don't
recommend it pigmentation is fantastic
but there's money together blend ability
is atrocious and the shades are so close
together they just turned into one big
glob of brown of warm Brown it's
terrible it's not a good color that's my
opinion it cosmetics naturally pretty
this one a lot of people hate this power
I like it I do I enjoy it like people
say it muddies on them it does not money
on me I actually really enjoy this
palette but you know I don't know I
guess it's you you just really have to
make sure you're choosing the light
color with a medium color with a deep
color you can't really use the medium
shades all together they will buddy you
can't use all the deep shades all
together they will muddy but if you
break it up you can get a really nice
really really nice look out of this the
trans transforming pearl is supposed to
make the mole shimmery these are all
matte shades transferring pearls doesn't
make it she's supposed to make shimmery
it doesn't at all it just kind of adds a
lamp glitter on top or shimmer on top
but it really doesn't do what it's
supposed to do it just doesn't kind of
lays on top it doesn't
mix but you know I'm the other thing
about this is look how filthy it is it
gets really gross because of this cloth
I don't know what they were thinking on
that one
but I do like that power I'm just
feeding up I have heard that the quality
isn't as good now as it was when these
first came out these are the build your
own eye shadow palettes by Bach some
really really like these a lot
I got these off hypsi with FC points
when they first came out quality is
amazing
and they're fun because you can take
this tray out and then you can change
out the different shadows so these pop
out like that this one is gorgeous this
one is called la la la la la la lavish
it's a very unique shade it's a purple
with a blue duochrome
in it it is gorgeous and they're very
easy to use very creamy very blendable
Chrissy says make it forever eyeshadows
are the bomb to you know I don't own any
makeup forever are shadows
expensive and I just haven't ever gotten
there having real in there all right em
cosmetics life palette this thing is
very mediocre I'm looking forward to
Michele reformulating all of this it's
very ordinary it's very drug story as
far as the quality like a good drugstore
palette not a stinky drugstore top but
like a good drugstore palette that isn't
as good as high-end does that make sense
oh thank you wing this I bought I think
it was like 50 bucks the original price
was like 80 bucks like totally not worth
a bucks I mean the shadows are just kind
of okay like they're they're relatively
easy to work with lasting power is okay
but definitely not living up to Michelle
Phan I mean Michelle Phan is like the
queen her eyeshadow should be like very
queen like and they're not Queen like so
I'm hoping now that she has control back
of her company that she will be able to
rock this formula and make it so so much
better so there you go Chrissy says I
mean make it forever I know I know I
know oh my goodness so many things I
need to show you this is terrible I
didn't show you
we're gonna get through a real quick
stupid this makes me feel like an idiot
okay
so I still have this many this is just
stupid this is young man okay like 20
lifetimes where the by shadow 20
lifetimes but it's good to have
comparison balance right am i sick in
the head or what I'm the second head
okay so we didn't get to the bomb we're
gonna go through the bomb real quick all
right Kat Von D this was a Ludwig
palette this was one of the first high
end my shadow palettes that I bought
loved it
very old love it this was the Kat Von D
monarch not monarch ladybird palette
another one that I love the only thing I
didn't like about this is color
selection color selection is really
difficult to work with because it's so
deep for my skin tone this was much much
better for deeper skin tones but if you
can find that on eBay and your deeper
skin tone highly recommend this one here
Kat Von D Esperanza palette I think this
came out last year oh my gosh such a fun
palette to play with this shades Selena
I know my hands a mess but I'm gonna put
it right there where it belongs right in
the front
purple blue duochrome oh my goodness
just amazing also Santeria oh I have to
show you Santeria I'm going over time
our night okay all right
this was a little tiny palette this is
called downtown drama this is another
really fun one that I like a lot great
quality there this one was sent to me
from my friend Nicole this is the black
palette yay or nay Nicole on YouTube
another amazing quality palette
wonderful wonderful wonderful and you do
that to the front don't use that forever
Kat Von D interstellar I don't feel like
I needed this and the chrysalis I mean
they are different I do like the
chrysalis
yes chrysalis I like the chrysalis color
selection better than this I feel like
this is too deep it's a little more
difficult to work with then the
chrysalis but it is very high quality
really good Kott again this is the
interstellar
two more little rock pallets that I had
from that collection this is a
blackberry truffle this is the dark
chocolate this was an oh this is an
eyeliner palette that doesn't even
belong in there okay but you can't get
those anymore okay are these all the
bomb okay we're gonna zip through the
bomb real quick and then we're gonna be
done indulge in white chocolate this one
really difficult to work with use that
very often I'm gonna pass along somebody
I did miss one cargo cargo warm neutral
palette Oh amazing amazing palette so
good so good so good amazing I got this
one little black bag if you remember
that website if you've ever owned little
black bag you know who because this that
was such a fun website it is now gone
they brand themselves out of business
but oh my goodness such a perfect little
palette if you can ever run into the
cargo warm and neutrals palettes amazing
amazing amazing okay here comes the bomb
meet matte nude matte noon beautiful
wonderful palette very fun to work with
except that there is not a cream shade I
wish that they had made a cream shade
instead of there's a yellow tone there's
a white and there's a very deep peach
tone but there's no cream champagne
shade time is thinking lightning round
oh yeah definitely total lightning round
Stephanie I said the same thing I'm
trying to go that's a but yeah this is a
very nice high quality palette but as a
complete palette it's difficult for me
to work with because I need that cream
shade and it's just not there these two
are too deep for me for that cream shade
that I need for my brow bone so you know
the quality all right new to versus new
dude new tune I don't like as much
because of the color selection this was
one of my first college my black broke
in shipping so it's a mess because the
black had broken difficult to work with
as far as the shade selection
blendability is awesome but the shade
selection kind of stinks so I don't
reach for this as often as you do
see the difference new dude much easier
to work with as far as shade selection
quality is still amazing but the shade
selection is definitely there with the
new dude so if I had to recommend one I
would have to I am gonna make a part two
Nikki Nikki this is the problem as I
still have a ton of drugstore palettes
and you're gonna do four part two I
don't have time I don't have time all
right sorry
yes external battle two versus do you
dude wins
dude wins alright let me slow it down a
little bit because I'm not trying to
stress anybody out all right if we go
over we go over BOM Jovi BOM joking here
we go shades selection is kind of like
device it's kind of all over the place
so it makes it more difficult to work
with quality excellent blend ability
excellent but difficult to work with in
the shade selection that's my opinion on
that one lips down here love that
they're covered highlight and blush are
amazing but kind of difficult to work
with I love a little mirror too and the
names are hilarious bonzai palette BAM
same kind of thing again kind of
difficult to work with in the shade
selection a little bit but easier to
work with then the other one a lot of
deeper shades in here this one's less
interesting as far as a color selection
though the looks that come out of it
just aren't as interesting down here are
some different guides and stencils I
don't use these I find these more
difficult to use than nothing I guess I
would just have to practice so the
quality is excellent quality is
excellent it's just I don't know I just
feel like this one's I really need to
move this to the front because I haven't
used this enough recently but they've
got a lot of really nice color
selections meaning that they got the
deep shades they've got some mid-tone
shades
I guess maybe they just I don't know
mm-hmm I need to move this to the front
and use it more because I feel like I
should love this more than I do like
looking at it I should love it more than
I do and I don't have like heart for
this palette I don't know why cause it's
a nice palette it's nice I don't know
but it's a great palette if you can work
it if you can work it let me make sure
okay oh gosh for the speed for a bit if
I stressed everybody out
I didn't mean to stress you balance I'd
rather take longer and not stress you
out
so I'm breathing now
so if I could go back and change it I
would but I can't it's live man it's
live so that's it for my high end shadow
collection I'm going to switch you over
to the camera view so I can show you my
drugstore collection I'm gonna go ahead
and pull you down here if your gets as
easily look away from the cab that's the
drugstore stuff so there's drugstore I'm
gonna bring it over here this is my pile
of high heads we just went over now I
gotta clean them up and put them all
away but I'll put them away in a
different order so that I end up
actually using some of these that I
should be using and then once again
there is the drugstore ones that we'll
be talking about next week so I'm gonna
pull you back up nice and slow so that I
don't make anybody sick I hope alright

super nice people ask all kinds of
questions upload your look should have
to worry about being perfect it's just

why it's such a wonderful community of
such positive people as we just we all
support each other and if anybody comes
with negativity we're like dude that's
not what we do here and and people that
don't like nice people they go away
quickly because you know they realize
