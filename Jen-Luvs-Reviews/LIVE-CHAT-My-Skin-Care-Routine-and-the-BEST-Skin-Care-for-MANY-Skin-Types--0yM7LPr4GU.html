hello oh thank you cherish says she
loved my vlogs thank you so much cherish
and Jen Jen I met in Salt Lake City and
she's bonded with my daughter Lila
alright so let's go ahead and go into
the skincare so as you may have known I
did a sponsored video for polished
choice I don't even know how long ago it
was a little while ago wasn't that long
ago so I'm still using a lot of the
small that polished with skincare
they're not sponsoring this video they
don't know that I'm mentioning their
products again this is just truly what I
am
music so Oh Thank You Grady for loving
the lungs I appreciate it they were all
I'm so glad you liked them if you
haven't
the vlogs they're actually pretty
interesting because there's traveling
across the country so that's kind of
cool
let me make sure I'm still squared up
okay because I move my computer a couple
times okay still spray it up look good
alright so let me show you what I use
let's start with morning routine so
morning routine washing the face happen
sometimes sometimes doesn't happen in
the morning I feel like when I wash my
face at least with my skin type if I
wash my face too much it dries out and I
feel like that's not good for my
wrinkles because any time you're drying
your face out more I feel like maybe
it's just my thinking in my brain it's
real or not but I feel like I'm gonna
get more wrinkles if my face is drier
that's just kind of what I'm thinking I
feel like that the moisture is going to
keep the wrinkles away I don't know of a
people with oily skin ever anywhere I
don't know but anyway I don't wash my
face every single morning but I do wash
it at night but maligning routines
sometimes I use the it's called the
resist perfectly balanced phone and cons
of high polished choice this is for
normal oily and combination skin ie
abnormal skin so I use this first and
then after that I use their toner this
is the advanced replenishing toner and I
do really like this Turner and you know
I know you're supposed to use a cotton
pad on your face sometimes I'm just too
lazy and I just putting a little bit on
my hand and I just flash all over my
face
I don't know if you're supposed to do
that or not again I just do things my
own way and probably logic why you can't
but that's so I used this Vicki says
meets you everything is like after
cleansing skin like I can't Elizabeth
says she's is that at night and Emily
says I wash my face twice a day I need a
combo skin yeah I really think they
don't ask your skin type too so anyway
so this is what I use I use this toner
afterward and then I use this one this
is the resist intensive wrinkle repair
retinol serum this stuff feels really
oily on the face I've gotten used to it
I'm actually starting to like acquire
the feeling like hey good acquire taste
I'm requiring like that really feeling
like I don't mind it as much as I used
to before I started using this so yeah
I'm actually kind of enjoying this now
it feels kind of good at the end of the
day it just really hydrate but it does
he leave
you don't like oily won't like this and
then I use the resist skin firming line
minimizer I feel like this has been the
one that really truly made a difference
this and this that I'll talk about in a
second like this stuff it's kind of
pricey for polished choice I think it's
like $40 which is a lot for polished
choice polish why stuff isn't super
expensive considering like the
ingredients and stuff they use and again
this is not sponsored this is just me
from my own experience so yeah let's see
do you guys recommend teenagers use
cleansers every morning we'll talk about
that we'll ask that man Harmon we look
for the fool here are you guys chat it
up I have fun so so yes this comes out
with a serum and it comes out of this
little thing and I just kind of Pat this
onto my wrinkles I also cut it onto my
neck because I'm getting some neck
wrinkles here and I go like this and
like this and lo it they're alert
they're a little bit a little bit over
here and I really feel like this makes a
big difference because if I don't use
this I can really tell over a couple of
days that I haven't been using it so I
think it's one of those you gotta keep
using it this I use once or twice a week
this one is also pretty awesome this is
to resist
weeklies resurfacing treatment with 10%
aah a I use this at night I'd use the
toner and then I put this on my face
after the toner and it does sting a
little bit in places sometimes it's an
exfoliator
and it does kind of give I didn't notice
this when I did the video the sponsor
video but this really does have
sometimes it can feel a little prickly
sometimes which is a little bit weird
but I do feel like it makes a big
difference that I when I don't use this
like when I was on my road trip I didn't
use this at all and I've definitely was
like oh moles with my face so so yeah
definitely saw a difference when I
didn't use this so I use this and that's
really all I've been using for my night
routine and I hate that it's all the
sponsored stuff but I'm just I can't
tell you it's something else just to try
to fit it in yeah just to make it look
like I'm not still using that yeah I
mean but I am that's what I use
um Marilee says it's never too early to
start good skincare especially in your
teens you don't need as many products
yeah that's true that's sure that's I
feel the same way I feel exactly I
shouldn't say that's true but that's my
opinion as well so morning routine
products that I use let's see so let's
do sometimes like I said I wash my face
sometimes I don't just and then I use
the toner and I use the resist daily
smoothing treatment with a H a for a
normal to dry skin if I if I'm using a
BB cream that day phenomena use a BB
cream I don't use any kind of sunscreen
because the BB cream has the sunscreen
in it but if I don't think if I know
specifically I'm not using anything with
sunscreen in it also put on throw on a
sunscreen I have one in my drawer it's
just like a generic sunscreen it's not
like anything magical or anything then
let me show you but but yeah this stuff
is it's very nice as well and it's kind
of similar to this like it's a daily
exfoliator I don't know whether this is
what's making a huge difference but I
think that it's good you know what
that's not true because there was a
period of time where I stopped using
this and I started seeing a little bit
of a difference so I mean it's all
supposed to be like a system so yeah
there was a time when I stopped using
this now that I'm thinking about it
because I was getting lazy in the
mornings and not giving anything in the
mornings like at all like nothing like
wake up brush my teeth so kind of thing
and I did start noticing a little bit of
a difference in my wrinkles so maybe
that was this maybe it was just not
doing anything in the mornings but yeah
so I like this one and then I've been
using for moisturizer in the morning
I've been using the Clinique kept start
this is the Hydra blur moisturizer
I got sold this at Sephora at the vib
Rouge event at the beginning of the
summer season they had just an event it
was just to announce new products there
was no sale or anything it was just to
announce new products and this is
something they sold me on it is really
hydrating like really hydrating super
hydrating oh my gosh like your face
feels like it's it doesn't dry down like
it doesn't seep in really really well
but it feels good it just doesn't seep
in so if you like your your moisturizer
to kind of go in and be done mm-hmm
if you need something that's really
hydrating this is this is gonna be for
you I don't really see the hydro blur on
my skin but I don't have super problem
skin either so maybe someone with bigger
pores would find this should be better
as far as a hydro blur effect it doesn't
blur on me I don't know I knee says
there's a blurred so somebody had asked
me o Sunday Riley I actually tried when
I went to that vib Rouge thing I tried
the blue drops the something oil and it
was weird it was really weird I don't
know if it did anything I just used it
for like two weeks pretty religiously I
use it for two weeks but it's really
hard on my skin to see any differences
because my skin isn't super problematic
that's why I'm not like reviewing it or
anything I think that it's just me that
I can't really see a lot of difference
in a lot of different things oh no
problem I really have is the anti-aging
thing and I've got so much going all of
all this polish twists up it's difficult
to see whether the Sunday Riley was
actually doing anything or if I stopped
using the Polish choice and started
using the Sunday Riley whether that
would have made a difference to be able
to actually see something so but it was
the blue drops I forget exactly what
that's called the blue little druggie
things and it was just a sample I'm not
gonna buy the full size so that's like
$150 or something crazy it's easy how
expensive that something so that is my
morning routine that's all I do in the
morning I do want to show you some other
products that I've used in the past but
before no yeah let me just show you it
will dip through my stuff and then we'll
get to the collective brain is usually
the bet yeah maybe the lunar oil that
might be a Tanya that might be it
and Deborah says she uses al genis for
anti-aging let's take a second and just
talk about the best anti-aging products
while we're talking about anti-aging and
then we're gonna do combo skin oily skin
and dry skin as we go so let's talk
about let's hear from the collective
brain I've got your favorite anti-aging
products that you use Toby says the the
Luna sleeping night oil I don't know if
you're recommending it if you're
identifying it because I think
right in identifying that that was what
I was talking about Alexandre says she
uses those sunday sunny rather than Luna
will and she does like it Sabrina says
from the makeup mom says polish choice
has really helps out my pores and I've
heard wonderful things about polish
choice for all skin care and that's not
the sponsored side I promise you it's
not I'm just speaking Kyla says none
because there's a lot of younger people
that watch the videos that don't really
do the anti-aging stuff I didn't do the
anti-aging stuff so I hit 35 so it's
might be why I've gone too long
Megan says hi Megan Megan says I love
philosophy I've been using the
anti-wrinkle miracle-worker NACE
Francesca says at what age do you
recommend starting the anti-aging
products I am NOT a skincare grew but I
would imagine from the things that I've
read that you should start as soon as
possible I mean I feel like I don't know
I feel like the stuff where it's like
targeted wrinkle stuff should be with
the first time you see a wrinkle you
know if you see a wrinkle to start
getting wrinkles up which you should be
doing skin care I feel like people
should be doing skincare from from the
jump from you know 16 maybe start doing
it whenever you start seeing skin
changing 15 maybe start doing like a
face wash and moisturizer kind of thing
that's what I'm gonna start Lyla on and
it's like about 15 maybe 14 let's see
Deborah says let's see Deborah says the
night masks splash is the super
hydrating it feels good on your skin
good morning Vande how are you letter M
says ROC from the drugstores great for
anti-aging fantastic Christy says Olli
Hendrickson I always say that wrong is
great Elizabeth says start using
anti-aging projects as soon as you start
buying your own products not your
parents that's a good a good day pilots
the Kyla's 15 I don't know about
anti-aging for you think that you should
you started at 15 Megan says start
anti-aging in your early to mid-20s I
wish I'd started earlier that's 10 32
and the wrinkles are like Donkey Kong
yeah he says I really like Beauty DNA
subscription box $25 a month get
skincare of your own in your own skin
concerns gotten great brands for my 15
year old skin Grady says I'm so bad
about skincare I'd use zero and
aging the one good thing is I am going
out of sun protection good for you
that's your anti-aging girlfriend you're
doing it Vicky says I'm 29 just started
noticing fine line just started
anti-aging stuff nice Patricia says I do
enjoy the oils I'm 33 and I do feel the
same
moisture back into my skin nice Jada
said it's 15 to young to start
anti-aging products I don't think that
it's like if I think it's not her you
know it's not like it's gonna do
anything bad and I don't think it's
gonna be a bad thing is it necessary I
don't know I don't think I'll be bad
Francesca says I the skincare routine
I'm thinking about adding in some
anti-aging stuff nice and Leslie says
skincare should start at puberty what
hormones start affecting the skin good
point and Anya says belief aqua balm
hydrates so well gets rid of fine lines
and Julie says she started at age 28 now
she's 51 and she barely has a wrinkle
there you go Julie let's go with Julie
Patricia says I think the anti-aging
agent is sunscreen when you're younger
in your 20s I agree
all right let me go into some of these
other products that I have another line
I want to talk about I know it's a
little bit pricey but it's I really like
this line a lot it's the tape Tata
I would say this one Tata Harper I got
this daily essentials now natural
anti-aging discovery kit when I was the
Birchbox shop a while back and I'm like
holding on it's because the products at
full size are so expensive this is a
really nice line it's a lot of natural a
lot of natural ingredients and it smells
really good it smells very fresh and
citrusy I really really like it a lot so
there's the rejuvenating serum in here
the hydrating fluorescence this is a
spray almost spray something on my face
oh oh oh it's gonna come out is it
broken and oh there you go art did you
guys know how much I love spraying stuff
on my face it smells so fresh and clean
and it makes me actually not hate
putting things on my face because it
just feels so good oh my gosh it feels
really good
alright here is the replenishing
nutrient complex I haven't used this
stuff in a while so I don't really
remember a whole lot about I just
remember really loving it
servicing masks and then this is the
rejuvenate regenerating cleanser I
remember really liking the cleanser a
lot and I remember really really liking
the serum a lot they also had an eye
cream they just gave a little tiny pack
but I remember really liking the eye
cream a lot and they sell it like this
because it's supposed to be like a
system and I did use it as a system for
a while but this was like I don't know a
while ago what was they at least six
months ago so it's been a while since I
dipped into this stuff but most of them
focusing on the polished Choi stuff but
I love this one I love it
alright so take a hardware is another
Tata Tata hardware is another one
another one that I want to show you
another line it's really good they
actually sent me these I had reviewed
I got a Key West aloe product in a
subscription box and I loved it I got
this this was the gentle facial cleanser
it's a very lemony scented product I can
pair this to the Sookie the S UK I
like the scrub the scrub is very very
similar in scent if you ever tried that
one it's very lemony fresh but it's like
a scrub and if you don't like the scrub
then I would recommend the Keywest a low
one and again this was sent to me so
just so you know but I didn't know they
were gonna send it to me they just saw
that video near like hey we saw you like
our products try these out so they gave
me a full-size of this and they also
gave me the the marine mask
I did this with Lila one night we had
the best time my skin felt really good
afterward and you guys know I'm not a
big math person but I did really enjoy
this so this is another line you might
watch I got is Key West aloe really
enjoy their products let's see this is
one that did not work for me this is the
glow therapeutic gentle cream cleanser
this did not work for me this actually I
would use this and then I would use a
little bit of Bioderma afterward and I
still had tons of dirt on my face after
I use this it says that it's for
sensitive skin so this did not work for
me at all so what I've been using this
for is I keep it in my makeup room and
then when I do swatches I put it on my
hand and I rub it real hard with a paper
with a paper towel with my towel and it
gets off makeup swatches really
well but I have to like rub you know
like the way I don't want to rub my face
but I can rub my hand that way you know
what I mean but it wasn't getting off
like with a splash it was not getting
off dirt and oils and makeup and stuff
it just wasn't doing it just with a
splash of water I think you'd have to
really get a towel or something to scrub
in order for it to work so I don't
really like doing that to my face so I'm
going to use this for my hand instead
for smudging Kathy says she loves Key
West alone nice Megan says I heard good
things about pixie glow tonic does
anyone actually seen a difference I
haven't expensive for a target brand
interesting Megan very interesting
Sabrina says what'd you think of the
melt makeup removers do they work well
oh oh you know what I should have
brought some out are you talking about
like the little cans the little tins
with the stuff in it oh my goodness how
did I not bring those in here I think
this is what you're talking about
I use the the one from the bomb it's
called that's a cola now I can't even
remember what it's called like it
slipped out of my head but the tin from
the bomb it's like an oil inside and you
use it to remove makeup really really
liked that one a lot but it does like
it's made out of relatively inexpensive
oils but it the fact that it's in a tin
and it works like I'm cool with it the
it but I do feel like it's kind of
overpriced for the ingredients that are
in there and then Sarah who I met in
Kansas City gave me one from the body
shop it's a camomile one I really like
that one a lot the only thing about the
camomile one from the body shop is it
does have a scent to it so if you don't
like scented products on your face
you're not gonna like it but it's really
good time bomb thank you there is it's
called time on something Megan but
there's like more to it than time bomb
it's something else
but yeah I really like those for taking
makeup off absolutely I like though like
bombing things Cheryl says she's been
trying cleansing oils I do have a
cleansing point oil that I want to talk
about this is the Josie Maran one this
is the Argan cleansing oil I do like
this but it's definitely not my favorite
formula because again I don't really
like the feeling of whale on my face
that much I'm just starting to get used
to it
so yeah
it works what is just the texture is a
little weird for me Karlis says the
product and the bomb works as well as
coconut oil in my opinion you know what
I did Carla is I put the coconut oil fit
one on one side and I put the coconut
oil on one side and the bomb on the
other side and they did the exact same
thing but this was the thing is the
coconut wheel felt gross to me like I
just felt really slimy and then and just
very oily and yucky
so texture wise I like the balm one
better but you're right they do the same
thing totally agree with you totally
agree Liz says I was olive I use olive
oil to take off my makeup including
waterproof mascara nice and super cheap
Nancy says regardless of your skin care
products I would try to use a milky
cleanser like glossy err gloss here is
how you say it first as a face wash
interesting Nancy good to know good to
know I don't think I've ever used the
milk cleanser Toby says tatcha cleansing
oil is great fantastic kay says I love
hunting oils but I always double cleanse
maybe that would work a maybe that would
work for me how are you K how's the
radio show going it's good to see you
Kay
very good to see you I want to come back
on your radio show one day that would be
awesome hopefully it's going oh she has
a podcast and if I can't put it put it
in the description after the video is
over so people can check out your
podcast I'm glad you're good double
cleanse I guess what she means by double
cleanses she does that way oh and then
she washes the whale off as well Leslie
says she's coconut oil to take my makeup
off and then Sabri so she didn't like
the Josie Maran stuff Wow
Tiffany says she loves the purity
cleanser and Anne says double cleanse at
night Patricia says hahaha yeah the oils
are kind of yuck at the beginning so I
did a night I did so I did only at night
going to bed like a slimeball haha it's
less of it and got the same results nice
okay yeah okay alright Leslie says I use
a combo of my solar water and a cure
coconut water makeup remover wipes it
off face makeup it's - Morgan Haida
Oregon Toulouse
hello Leslie says the gentle face wash
Kathy says she loves purity - hi Ann how
are you and good to see you
alright so let me go in just a couple of
more things and then we'll talk about
different skin types do I have anything
else oh I want to talk a little bit
about these little um little claw things
I've done with this this is called glove
GL o V it's www giove me I got this in
glossy box I want to say and it's kind
of lengthy on the makeup eraser but it's
in a little finger glove form and it
works it definitely works it's kind of
weird that you just use your finger come
on oh but it's nice that it's kind of
targeted that you can kind of go like
this and then what I do to clean it is
just after I'm done I take a little hand
soap and I just go like this and run it
in the water and I clean it and it's
done and I feel like that's really nice
to be able to just clean it really
quickly with a little bit of hand soap
so I do like that better than the makeup
eraser I personally really like my
makeup eraser a lot I misplace it for a
really long time I've just found it
again I'm so excited it does really work
are there things that are cheaper can
you just get a microfiber towel from the
dollar store probably I haven't
personally tried it I've heard from
people that I trust and say that it does
work just as well but I haven't tried it
we do a good video the makeup eraser
versus microfiber towel from the dollar
store and see which one removes better
I've never seen a video like that I
think the video mental note
but yeah I really do like these things I
think they work great so I don't know
what your experience is with these but
they were great for me I really like
them a lot oh and then the last thing I
wanted to show you was this this is I
got this off Birchbox shop this is the
Liz Earle naturally active skincare this
is the cleanse and polish hot cloth
cleanser and you have to use one of
their claws where it doesn't work like I
found like the splash and go like you
know put it on splash it off it doesn't
it's the same thing at the Glo
therapeutics like you have to really use
one of their costs and it does come with
calls when you get it but I found this I
liked it when I first got it I actually
got a sample of
and then I ended up buying a full-size
but the more I use it the more I realize
what a pain-in-the-butt it is I stopped
using it but it is more gentle like if
you like a gentle cleanser then this is
nice too Francesca says she loves it and
I heard I know a lot of people love this
but do you find that it's a pain you
have to use a cloth for it Deborah says
that's how I clean my makeup eraser
because I use a fabric softener in my
machine I also should always use hand
soap interesting Annie says I'm just
gonna call you Annie
again sending good vibes from Vancouver
Canada so have your back oh thank you my
kids are obsessed with going to Canada

to see you home and safe and sound I
love your vacay vlogs that keep me great
company throughout my chemo treatments

keeping you company I'm sorry you have
to go through chemo treatments but I'm
glad that they can kind of ease the pain
a little bit
I'm so sorry girlfriend but I'm glad I
can help a little bit
Kate girls Scott is there a difference
between a mice underwater and a toner
yes my solar water for me this is my
thoughts off the top of my head the the
point of a toner this is another
Turner's in the show this is the ending
leo is using this before I've got the
published or stuff this is another
really great spinner the point of a
toner is that it supposed to kind of
bring your pH balance back to normal so
when you clean your face how you
sometimes get that well it's right
feeling on your face this is supposed to
bring the pH back and so that your face
feels like normal so you don't have
especially dry skin or especially while
this game is supposed to like bring your
pH back where my solar water I find for
me I mean this to be totally wrong this
is my in my brain not being a skincare
person so please correct me if I'm wrong
the Bioderma is is the micellar water
that I use this is more with a cleanser
it's a very very very gentle cleanser so
they definitely have to
um different purposes even though they
can look very similar they both look
very watery so I can see where you would
make the association that they may be
for the same purpose but from my
understanding it's totally different
yeah Tiffany says toner balances my slur
cleanses my slur water as a cleanser yup
there you go so I am right yeah I
sometimes I hesitate to answer certain
questions I don't want to be wrong but
you know everybody's wrong sometimes
let's see Paula wants to know has anyone
tried the long la see you are a lying
from all these the facial washing night
cream are fantastic interesting
Valentino says cheetah says thank you
love you to bits I'm also from Canada
Montreal yay
I'd love to send some kid the kid some
kinder eggs oh my gosh they're obsessed
they're absolutely obsessed um let's see
what else
my slit case has my slow waters a
cleanser yes and says much the waters
good for first cleanse and take off
makeup yes Bioderma is better than jet
oh no something happened with your with
your keyboard Toby know what that means
I can't decode it Kim says welcome home
Jen thank you so much Leon says I've
just been using my solar water in the
mornings my skin's doing great it really
is fantastic my solar water crystal says
I can never find biochar anywhere so
just by the simple my slur waters that
you like it Krista I've heard really
good things I've heard the Garnier is
fantastic - yeah Toby says the Garnier
and Bioderma hands-down pyoderma is the
bomb k says I agree Elizabeth says
toners can balance or hydro or hydration
I use a hydrating toner from fight Omar
vital mer staffs potent for Bioderma
that's went from Bioderma
can get Bioderma english that's very
true um Jenna says aw I miss you too
Jenna
Jackie says toners break you out
recently Thomas right Wow I wonder if
there's anybody else to toners break
them out I've never heard that before
blinky says she's also kept yeah
I live near Cantor check up there on the
foot Bioderma always have to grab extra
her friends nice we an such uses the
simple brand nice my my nail racking
back on his sleigh thank you I need to
go through my nail polishes and make
sure that they're also good I'm sure
some of them aren't yet anymore I keep
my stuff way too long oh there's another
thing I want to talk to you guys about
cuz we're at ten thirty sixty one other
thing on I talked to you about and then
we got to go into different skin types
specifically alright
toner speaking of toners I was using
this for a while this is the apple cider
vinegar with the mother by Bragg I was
using this on my face as a charm it
smells atrocious it smells really really
bad like really bad and it stays on your
skin like if you sleep in a bed with
someone else you may want to skip this
because they're gonna be able to smell
your face on the other side of the bed
so just you know be aware be aware is
longer you're okay with that you're in a
secure relationship we're good so yes
I've been using this and it stings like
a mother like like a mother stings oh my
god feels terrible but supposedly it's
amazing supposedly it's fantastic so
I've suffered through when I suffered
through I don't know
Oh Leslie says she mixes it with
purified water see that makes sense I
put it on like put it on Amanda wants to
know if toners are a must I feel like it
depends on like your skin type I would
say it's a must for everybody
Christmas as I don't use toners I just
use it on when moisturizer instead it
works wonders for me there you go I
think you have to do what's best for you
you know what's best for your skin I
think you have to just try different
things and see whether whether it makes
a difference for you I personally do I
first when I first started using skin
care stuff like religiously I didn't use
a toner and then when I started using it
I noticed that my skin felt better after
cleansing when I used a toner it just
felt good to use it so like it really
felt like I didn't have that police
sensation like that try feeling that for
I wash my face okay Leslie says you have
to mix it with purified water girlfriend
I used it like straight on my face for
like two weeks I was like
it smells bad so it's not easy you can
see how much I use not very much but
that's good you know see this is what I
need but that's all I have on my table
so I want to go into talking a little
bit about about different skin types so
