of the makeup chat we're swatch cleaning
over here oh it's been a crazy busy day
I spent the day with my kids running
around doing errands and stuff it's nice
to just like sit and chill and hang out
with my friends so that's what we're
gonna be doing for the next hour I do
want to do of course my disclaimer in
the beginning because you guys know if I
don't I get it mystery comment saying
and much they don't look like chat
because you can't get the information
quickly and edited
I can't edit every video because my
videos took a long time
edit so sometimes live chat is the best
way for me to get info to you if you
don't like live chat I'm really really
sorry there's so much other content on
the channel but I hope you'll be able to
enjoy but I do really enjoy I try to be
doing you the very long time I really
enjoy talking to the collective Bri you
know break up Awesomeness also know the
people that are here when I then also
you watch him on the replay for watching
under play you can participate in the
collective brain by taking comments
about your thoughts down in the comment
section and just all have a big old
conversation say it's going extremely
conversation based today we're gonna be
talking about products that have come
out within the last month what I did was
I went through the once we make up
photos from the show from the past month
from since January 1st to now and kind
of I wanted to go through them and talk
about the parts that are coming what are
we thinking about them what are we
thinking about you know are they just
the same things over and over again is
anybody coming up with anything unique
is there anything that we're really
excited about that we want to purchase
anything that you've already purchased
that you've tried none of these things
that I'm going to talk about today are
things that I've actually purchased I
just kind of want you to talk about them
so it'll be interesting to hear what the
community says because it's possible
that one if not quite a few people have
purchased these products already so
materials to hear what they're saying
about these things one thing I wanted to
do another housekeeping thing I wanted
to do before we started the chat is that
we've been getting more comments
recently on the last words
make up the same person commented I
think five or six times about it and
then the same person commented back
underneath that person talking about the
new format of what's it been make up and
how they prefer the old format so I
wanted to explain to you what we did and
how it's really not very different it's
pretty much the same you don't think
that there's this huge difference and
really it's not very different let me
tell you exactly what we did with what
did the make up just very quickly and
then we get into the products so what we
did was we have been digging deeper we
have a new top news reporter and she's
really really good her name is Elise
she's finding all these really great
news stories that we weren't finding
before when I was looking and a previous
hot news reporter somehow we weren't
finding them I couldn't find them but
somehow at least is finding all these
great stories so the top news segment
has been expanded for the most part
there's a lot more segments but the as
far as the topics and everything people
are saying they're too politically
charged but if that's what's happening
in make up news that's what I feel like
we should be talking about it make up
news whatever is happening I want to
talk about some other things are gonna
be light-hearted some of them are gonna
be more serious and personally I do love
Todd needs I think top news is my
favorite part because the part I find
who is interesting and the part that I
think is the most news like and it's a
new show so having things that are
happening in the news is you know that's
newsworthy so for me that's what I feel
like it's good not everybody's gonna be
happy I totally get that and no matter
what I do not everybody's gonna be happy
so anyways so we expanded the top news
just a little bit we just have more
stories now with the product report all
we've done means cutter report is still
there in its entirety almost the only
things we're cutting out are like we
used to talk about like the lipsticks
head shade extension so you know she
when she extended to lipstick shades in
their line that already existed or
there's an eyeliner pencil from you know
essence and it's just an eyeliner pencil
and there's nothing different about it
that's just the pencil and there's two
shades and do we really care about that
you know what he needs so we've caught
some of that like extra little piddly
stuff that I personally wasn't
interested in no one was ever talking
about in the comments I felt like that
the product was good
and this woman this woman this one and
hewed on way too long with products that
i didn't personally find interesting and
nobody was talking about them in the
comments so we trimmed a little little
bit of that out but we're still trying
to talk about all of the major releases
in the product report the other thing
people are saying is they wish that it
said it was Sephora and then Ulta and
then you know it is it's all still there
it's all in the same order we just don't
have the little sections they're the
little you know tag line that says
Sephora and now in the alter report and
now in this it just doesn't say that
anymore but it's all still there I
probably should still there and the best
way you can find that if that's your
favorite part is to go in the video
description and click on the timestamps
that's where that is stuff you're not
interested in top news I won't take it
personally just skip it and go to the
product report it's still there you know
so I'm getting frustrated as a creator
because people are getting upset about
things that really haven't changed it
just seems like it's changed and of
course the other thing we know the
change the lightning round where now
it's an audio version and we thought
that touch them people seemed to really
love
we've also added in the text to the
indie section of the brand names people
also seem to really love that and we
change the order just a tiny bit move
the lightning round up a little bit and
then we have the sales and then we have
the delay breaks so I mean it really
isn't that different so if you you know
know somebody that watches the show
that's upset about it if they you know
direct them to this part of this video
so that they can you know understand
come where I'm coming from and it's
really really not that different I
promise it's just you know in the
holiday season I don't go along this for
a while I'm gonna get off this topic in
a second but the holiday season there's
so many new releases cuz it's the
holidays is the busiest time of year for
makeup so maybe it seems like there's
less products because there actually is
like there are less products coming out
there's a lot less parts coming up in
there were in December so that makes a
big difference as far as the number of
products as well so the fact that we
changed in in December when the product
releases were less I think autumn in
December in January the park leases were
less I think that you know makes it feel
like there's less products when it's not
really us it's the road
this is that are coming out and we did
trim a little but I honestly don't think
that you guys would miss much the things
that were turning out I mean it's like
random little piddly stuff that does
anybody really care I know I don't so
but if you noticed something we're
missing in the show we wish that we had
covered it please leave it in the
comments down underneath the video say
hey you missed this I wish that you had
included it it's totally cool if you
want to leave comments with them totally
good with that so that is all I wanted
to say about that let's get into the
topic of this video a week before
working with you I'm sorry they fund
replay you're gonna get back because I'm
not on top again I just want to say hi
to the people my collective brain just
really quickly and then I want to see
what's happening with the checks I've
read anything in the chat yet and I want
to see what people are saying so let me
scroll all the way up to the topics even

let's go ahead and let's go ahead and go
into the product so what I did was I
transferred the products over to my
phone we're gonna talk about mainstream
releases first and then we'll talk about
any releases after that so importance
gonna hang out for that that she's been
evil alright let's go
where's my phone okay let's go to other
pictures and the scroll back scroll back
alright so these are the ones that I
picked out as kind of the most
interesting to me so I think I'm not
sure how this has been out for a minute
I don't know why I'd be happy in our new
show in January but this has been out
for a while this is my it's the it's my
ring right palette by BH Cosmetics I
feel like this is I don't know I guess
it's got some unique shades in there but
you know like I think it's it's cool I
don't know it's not calling to me like
there's something about it that's not
fun to me I mean I think it's a whole
the thing which included like the purple
and the red I think that's going I like
that me has the contour shades down
below like contour and highlight there I
don't know I don't think I'm not
interested in this one well Martha likes
the flow of the show better now - let me
put it this up here it's what you guys
think Oh Devin let's talk about the
blood sugar puff look remind me we'll
talk about that when we get to Indy
Heather said I ordered the new GDS post
festival politics things late I'm so sad
and iya says I love that pallet oh my
goodness okay yeah Whitney said spit out
for a while I feel like it has been RM
says I love that pallet yep okay yeah
yeah ivory says generic I don't know I
mean if yeah we got some some different
cool pops of color in there I don't know
maybe it's just me but I'm feeling like
I just have so many of the same shades
over and over and over and over again
it's hard for me to feel inspired you
know it's hard for me to feel like yes
this is something new to something
unique this is so cool
you know so I don't know I'm not moving
spired by that one's a 21 color
eyeshadow highlighter and contour
palette hmm well no people are saying
they love it though that it's um it's
good quality I mean in BH Cosmetics does
put out some good cause I found BH
Cosmetics to be very hit and miss it's
like their new image stuff is better
than the older stuff crystal says the
swatches in the BH Cosmetics look bomb
No very cool Whitney says I have that
shape I love that shade selection I have
no idea why I haven't looked into it
okay well there you go there you go okay
let's talk about the next thing I have
on here this I thought was really
interesting I remember reading this and
thinking but these are the elf booster
drops you guys remember these from a few
weeks ago from the show so this yellow
one right here
is supposed to change your skin color
it's supposed to like make you a
different color like more like tan
looking I guess but it like really turns
me off at the fact that the liquid in
there is yellow and the strip is yellow
like I already feel like you know some
foundations like my foundation for
what's at the makeup this week oh my
gosh I looked at it on the replay I was
like why is my face so yellow it
cosmetics CC cream totally yellow it's
the shading like totally yellow on me
but I'm a little nervous about this did
anybody try this if you've tried this
you've gotta let me know the booster
drops from ELF especially since they're
so inexpensive
they make me really nervous Oh George
says those elf drops broke out my skin
so bad
oh yeah I mean it just does freaked me
out a little bit uh and you know this is
the thing there's something's I trust up
with this is not something I trust out
with yo they went the wrong way with the
yellow for me but that bright yellow and
I've never seen anybody a skin tone
that's bright yellow like that so that
would be amazing the other booster drops
I forget what they were supposed to do
but I know me I don't know if it is just
a self tanner or not I don't I don't
know they freak me out okay I don't know
if this is still available I was out
with my kids all day and I didn't have
time to find the prices on everything if
I'd had more time I would have prices on
everything and I would have made sure
that this particular one was still
available this is the selfie can't buy
the support so for favorites I love
these Sephora favorites kids especially
if I first started my channel I felt
like these were so good for me because I
got to try a lot of high-end products at
a very inexpensive price so let me put
it back up just in case you didn't see
it sometimes I go too fast but I looked
at it and I was like I'm really not that
interested in this stuff I don't have
the list here but it looks like that
only full sized item is the Tarte
eyeliner which is it my styling or so if
you're interested in that eyeliner it
may be worth it to get the whole thing
there's a Marc Jacobs mascara there's an
autist off via like core league kind of
lips think it looks like a brownish the
Burt Corley kind of lipstick there's a
Becca highlighter there's a milk makeup
I think that's the blur stick and then
this I think it was like stellar stellar
cosmetics there's a powder in here but
if you don't have a big makeup
collection I feel like these things are
really good but I feel like I'm at this
point where I'm kind of like I've tried
a lot of this stuff already so I feel
like for me this is gonna be a no but I
can see where this would be extremely
useful to a lot of people as Sara says
it's a $21 eyeliner yes and I feel like
this kid is only like $28 or something
so rissalah has my shirt yeah there were
a bunch of us that jumped on this shirt
when all that went down swatch
I love the idea of having the swatches
on our hair here
the swatches on the arm and that's so
cute I do kind of wish that they were
darker colors though it's like they
don't really show up as much as I wish
that they did but it's such a cute idea
all right crystal says I used to have
Sephora beauty amplifier primer and I
use my soft medium bare minerals on top
and it looks so good a huge surprise I
don't think I know either of those
products I'll have to check those out
because I don't know those Jenna says
you can mix two liquid lippies with a
lip brush any Penny mix two liquid
lippies with a lip brush anyone I would
imagine you can I don't imagine you can
do anything you want yeah sure I would
imagine the easier with liquid lipsticks
than it would with stick lipsticks cam
says o-tama pledge the blood sugar
palate okay everybody wants talk about
the blood sugar pot I'm not buying it I
don't buy Jeffers star products for
personal reasons even though the
products I have tried by Jeffrey star
are very high quality the man who makes
it makeup I do not knock him for that
but I haven't quite gotten over things
that he's done and I haven't seen enough
change yet but I feel like he's done a
really good job recently of kind of
curbing his public negativity and things
but I'm not quite on the Jeffrey star
thing yet I'm I'm maybe I don't like to
hold things against people for forever
but it's hard one man son
I don't buy Jeffers star stuff but I'm
not saying forever I won't buy Jeffrey
star stuff but for now I'm still on a no
but maybe one day maybe one day but no
on that as far as the design of it I
don't have a photograph of it here it's
a lot of reds and pinks and things for
me that's that color scheme isn't no
because I don't like a lot of Reds on my
eyes I would imagine really really nice
on medium to deeper skin tones I feel
like that palette would just be
incredible not like with paler skin
tones that might look bloody you know
like if you don't especially you might
think like me I wouldn't know how to use
a lot of those colors also I kind of
wish they'd be put more Browns in there
I feel like Browns would have really
kind of brought the palette look
together I feel like so
the shades at least from the photo look
like they're kind of similar I didn't
watch his video arm and I know he put
one off but I didn't watch it so you
know that one's gonna be a note for me
nominee no I know that's indie but I
knew people wanted to talk about that
one so it's been like talked about
talked about in the chat right now Sarah
Oh Sarah says I think he's aged she's
gotten a little better that he's mature
and maybe and maybe he's realizing it's
just not worth the hassle you know it's
not it's not worth it to him anyone I
don't know I don't know I don't know him
I've never met him so I've seen him once
you walked past me once but I never talk
to him or anything so I don't know door
says I'm pale and I absolutely love Reds
on my eyes Jacqueline hope alex has some
beautiful reds and they look great that
is awesome Dora I'm so glad you are able
to pull it off I have trouble with it
but I'm really really glad you can and
I'm sure there are lots of people that
can just like you it's just you know
Tonya says when is Queen a Wrangler the
colored hearthstone Queen Queen of
Hearts bipolar drain coming out it
didn't somebody say February I think
they did Miller gross says what is in
the indie is an independent makeup brand
so it's a brand that doesn't have a
parent company so even until like a year
or two ago I forget what it was even
till he live a year or two ago Too Faced
was an indie brand because we didn't
have a parent company and then they sold
to Estee Lauder so any brand that is
their own brand doesn't have a parent
company technically colour-pop k'kaw and
Kylie cosmetics are not indie brands
because they're all owned by on CD but
we usually put them in an indie anyway I
don't know why but we do but they feel
indie I don't know they just feel I do
but they're not but yeah it's like
mainstream versus independently owned
okay this one I didn't have a picture up
either a hood wants to know please talk
about your thoughts on the Kat Von D I
am divine pallets I kind of want it but
at the same time it's like am I really
gonna wear neon Dury maybe that would be
fine
Marsha says February 27th or 28th for
the Queen of Hearts trades there you go
I think it's fun I don't again I don't
have a picture I'm really sorry I didn't
save that one but but it's really I mean
it's cool-looking I don't know I might
have to go to support get my put my
fingers and I have some support credit
that I have on those cards and they told
me that I can't use them online people
have told me I can use them online but
every time I've tried it hasn't worked
and the people at Sephora told me it
doesn't work but those like white cards
than you use for store credit I have a
couple of those so maybe when it comes
into stores I'll go check out the Kat
Von D divided house that's when I'm kind
of on the fence with Sarah says I want
that palette Devine is beautiful I know
I know I'm here next I'm just gonna call
you fair next so that people know your
channel cuz you need to go check her out
if you especially feel like independent
indie brand makeup independent brand
makeup she's amazing for that she said
she likes the kat von d palette I would
wear those colors
it's PHY RRA and then Nick's like NYX
Cosmetics NYX even though NYX is it with
a goddess right mr. Nix is a goddess
that was before the makeup friend RM
says I wish the green was on its own
yeah that green is nice alright let's go
to the next one next one go I lost my
pictures my phone turned off hold on got
a scroll got a scroll where was I
okay so next up is the wonder brow right
here of course I love your channel okay
so this I've gotten a request to review
this so this is probably the one I'm the
closest to purchase a because I've
gotten a lot of requests for this and I
see it in the drugstore all the time
every time I go to the drugstores the
CBS I always see it so I'm really think
about person game is twenty dollars
though so I don't know and also if you
haven't noticed I'm not really great at
brows so maybe that would be good though
because then you know people that also
aren't really great at browns we get an
idea of whether this would be good for
them I don't know but yeah so I'm
thinking about maybe getting that I
don't know Debbie says I've tried that
it's very pigmented okay good to know
Andre says okay
oh I'm gonna watch beer cuz I really
want to know about any yes go go they're
great place to find all about all that
information
another one is Angelica Nyquist I'm
gonna pronounce your name I don't know
if I did it right but Angelica and why
we v y2 is T there's a Vienna line a
queue in there let me see if I type it
into the search and find it out and Jo
there we go and and Y Q V is T there we
go I got it wrong I got now I'd have it
right Angelica so she also does a lot of
nd makeup on her chin as well but yeah
so um yes Oh creo the crayon palette
we're gonna get to that one I have that
one name here but yeah so that's one of
them I try I don't know
okay this one I think is really here you
don't have to explain this to me if you
understand this I don't get this one and
maybe because I'm not a makeup artist
but I don't get this one at all this is
called the Becca anti-fatigue under eye
primer it's now for my understanding
when people are tired their eyes kind of
get blue under here you need to get this
grey dark circles
it's the blue gonna make them look worse
I mean is that a dumb thing to say but
it's like a turquoise thing to put onto
your eyes I don't get that at all it's
like it's like seriously turquoise oh do
you get this I don't get it there's got
to be something I'm missing because I
would imagine that I wouldn't put
something out with it didn't make sense
like that you know what I mean no no
Nancy's here okay won't it turn out
happy birthday to you happy birthday to
you happy birthday dear me happy
birthday to you is my friend Nancy's
birthday today happy birthday Nancy long
long long long okay back to this okay so
yeah does happy birthday dance because I
love you okay so I'm hoping I get to
meet me answer this summer that's in the
plan
okay Jessica says that she thinks this
is infused with caffeine Jen says it's
because the caffeine in it so is it
is it blue when it goes on your skin and
does the caffeine actually like sink
into your skin and make your eyes like
look more awake because with their mind
like missing something but I think they
for caffeine but you have to actually
ingest caffeine in order to be more
awake like am i rep coffee all over my
body am I gonna get more weight look is
that how it I don't think that's gonna
work
vanity pastas depends on the eye color
and undertone for the dark circle thing
I don't I don't get it I don't get it
okay Denise says it goes on the skin
clear it's not blue people are saying no
it's a bomb okay yeah sorry I hope I
didn't embarrass you Matthew I love you
Nancy
Nancy's my guardian angel of makeup
she's amazing
okay so positively catatonic says
caffeine is a pretty big molecule yeah
so like how in the world is it gonna go
into Oh Sarah says caffeine stimulates
blood flow oh no I'm gonna have to look
into this more oh no I don't get really
bad dark circles like I'm kind of tired
right now but I don't have I don't get
really bad dark circles I think we'd
have to try something on somebody that
actually had significant losses okay
Melissa says it constricts blood vessels
results in deep puffy
well there you go I'm learning out new
things this is why I love the chance to
bring because while reading together
okay so let's go on to the next thing
thank you so much for clarifying that
for me because I was very careful okay
next up is by hourglass it's the arch
brow shaping and fiber gel so it's for
brows and it looks like this and I think
that looks really cool I like that the
brow brush I don't know it's hard to
tell how big that brow brush is it might
be too big because remember that what
was it Revlon um is it Maybelline a
Revlon I can't remember a giant ball on
the top and the bug went everywhere it
was terrible it was really really bad so
I don't know if this is gonna be the
same kind of situation where you need
like really thick brows for it to work
I'm not really sure
Tiffany says lots of skin products
contain caffeine well I learned
something new
I haven't found many in my and my
travels but that doesn't mean that
they're not out there how much is the
hourglass brow gel I don't have it here
let me move it it our arch Wow well
that's a pencil not the pencil sculpting
what is it there it is it's $28 oh no I
think there's more much $28 oh no it
does look good I think I'd have to watch
similar news first to see whether I
needed that in my life I don't think I
need it in my life though I don't Sara
says that kind of like the larger
brushes for brow products my brow hairs
are so damn darn long this thing is
there's kids listen anything yeah and
yeah I'm for people with thicker brows
let stuff really works their analysis I
use what coffee lip scrub I picked it
from Ulta and helps me with my lips it's
good to know this stuff all right
so now what's going to me that's oh here
we go George George says I love the
hourglass brow gel it's a lot it's a
it's a bit bigger than like a benefit
gimme brow gel brush but it gives the
brow so much fullness nice because the
one by benefit is really small I could
do one that was a little bigger than the
benefit one you just realized what 27
minutes in so I should probably pick up
my piece a little bit all right next up
Pat McGrath mothership for know I am NOT
getting this no no no I am I am
resisting on this I am anti-consumerism
on this if anti-consumerism was a verb I
would be doing that to this because it
is beautiful and I have a mothership
palette and I think one's enough I don't
think I need to buy any more because
that hurt my heart when I bought it
really cool there's a few shades in that
mothership palette that are so unique to
my collection I personally feel like
it's worth it to me to have one but I
don't think I'm gonna buy another one
even though I would really like
Jim Brown thing the Julia Brown thing is
really cool but no man I actually stay
away from it I need to stay away from
because if I swatch it I may be in some
trouble but I'm not I I just have to go
away from it beautiful it's too
expensive
all right next up this is something I'm
definitely not fine and this is not
calling to me at all this is the
hourglass ona hourglass this is the
Natasha - no not diamond and blush
palette but eighty two dollars I saw the
it's on the price tag on this and I was
like oh no no I'm not buying
I mean Natasha - no no I get it the
individual pans are probably like the
eyeshadows are probably worth it we can
break it down at price per pan and
everything but you know these colors
were they're not my style
like never would I ever never would I
ever
that's a funny here let me put it back
up never would I ever if I had these in
my drawer these three shades in my
drawer would I reach for those I can't
see myself reaching for those at all on
the highlight shades maybe but anymore
at that price for me that's gonna be
enough that's gonna be your name Cole
says oh note my friend Nicole is here
from uni Nicole you should check out her
channel - I want that in Tasha the
mushroom - no no watch out what Nicole
is blond and gorgeous so I didn't see
Nicole rocking this because she's got
that blonde that's going on but for me
this is gonna be enough but I could see
Nicole really doing well doing well with
this Oh
denisa she bought it and she loves it
well there you go
nothing short says hi bills miss Natasha
- Nona
there you go all right next up this one
right here collectively we all know what
this one is right everybody now okay
well I'll tell you just in case you
don't know who's not everybody knows
this is the Too Faced white peach
eyeshadow palette features in cream
collection
I am waiting I don't like money
set but if you haven't seen makeup
struggles I'm waiting for her to talk
about this because this is like a one
that I can just see her looking at and
being like no no because it's just it
looks like just a bunch of like shades I
mean it some of them look cool I haven't
got my fingers in it maybe it's cool I
don't know
but this is not calling to me at all
like at all I think something is really
gonna have to WoW me with toothpaste for
me to buy more to face I feel like I'm
but backslider do says the action
palette you know right look everybody
say no no no hard pass in their way nope
well I'm not feeling it I mean I think
that if I put my fingers in it like
maybe let's this shimmer shade right
here this reddish one maybe that one
would be like a good one or like this
nice shimmery guys down here maybe those
are the selling points I haven't watched
a lot on this so I don't really know
this says new fruit toothpaste and you
know what the wow that I used to go way
back in Jeremy and he knows time line on
his Instagram you'll find a picture of
strawberry champagne and he says I see a
new collection being born or something
like that and paraphrasing it something
like that
there's supposed to be a strawberry
collection coming out but when will it
come out I have no idea but I'm really
hoping I thought they were to move away
from this pitch by now but apparently I
recess fruit salad as Angelica said ëno
right oh yeah I'm kind of I'm done with
the peach I'm like so over the peach me
I feel like they need to move on
I think strawberry is really smart I
think strawberry is a great idea Oh
fiona says Tara I'm Tara from tar babies
just did a review and she said there's
not enough mid-tone shades and that's
what it looks like to me it looks like
they got light light light light light
one mid-tone and too deep that's it yeah
I know and that's the way I thought
about like the lorac at the I love
brunch palette or the Houston brunch
crowd or whatever they called it felt
like that about that one who's not a lot
of light shades so I feel like
strawberries is a smart move I wish
they'd just move on to it move on
already
alright this is another one that says
pineapple love this and find out
one day raw Beauty Christy and I are
gonna go in on it into it because she
doesn't like pineapple on pizza and I
love pineapple on heat so one day we're
gonna get into it about it hmm I'm a big
pineapple that all right this is one
that's another one I'm kind of on the
fence about getting and I really think I
might get it this is the NARS radiant
long rare foundation this is that I
believe the new foundation if I'm
getting this right this is the new one
because I've never owned an artist
foundation and I'm thinking that I might
want to own in our foundation and they
do have an unchanged which is great
because they did make that promise and
doing the Georgia Harris he's doing a
15:30 challenge and I'm gonna do that as
well with her if you don't know Georgia
Harris she has now become a friend of
mine she has an awesome youtube channel
but she's doing the 1530 chunk so it's
15 shades of concealer and 30 shades of
foundation or just a gradient range of
shades you know one of the others you
know only reviewing things that I'm
purchasing things that have a gradient
at least they look like they're trying
to accommodate lots of different skin
tones and I believe in ours is one of
the really good ones with that so I
think I need to buy a NARS foundation I
think it might need to happen you might
need to happen that's one that I'm like
that's why I'm doing my call it's an
anti haul because I knew there was gonna
be things they know them thinking about
by Elizabeth says yes review the NARS
please it's so funny Elizabeth Bryant I
used to work with an Elizabeth Bryant so
every time I see your name Elizabeth
Bryant I think of her and she was such a
nice person she was like one of those
like really sweet like grandma ladies
that was just like the Cheryl to see
that she's gonna matter if calling
grandma lady could she's a grandma but
she was just this person so whenever I
see Liz with Bryan I always think of her
amber says I bought it and I loved it
and I said I think I want it but mixed
reviews for combo oily skin gotcha I
have normal skin so not sure black dye
besom process NARS foundation brakes are
out vanity polish says I choose the NARS
vanity posh so she uses the NARS
concealer okay well I'm thinking about
getting it I'm definitely considering it
I'm thinking about it all right let's
move on to the next one
thing that I I kind of might I don't
want to buy it but because I have such
bad experiences with this brand I
shadows I don't think I'm gonna get it
this is the Lancome I should her palette
we talked about this this week this is
their brand new collection and the
colors are really cool and unique so I
was thinking about getting it but I've
had such bad luck with Lancome shadows
then I'm I think I'd have to put my
fingers in it to see how it felt but I
don't really I don't know I'm scared I
don't know I might want to get it though
I don't know because the colors are cool
you know it's got these this whole like
colored brush on the bottom hello maybe
Andre said you look skinny Jan thank you
I came back five pounds of pounds that I
lost so I'm only five down to this
points I appreciate that Melissa says I
still want to talk with you about
supernatural Castiel says hi oh hello to
Castiel at Castiel for me Oh Devon says
she thinks it looks like um make sure I
got your print yes Devon said that she
thinks it looks like pigs makeup it does
kind of but at least is different you
know what Lisa's different um Tony said
the colors look like looks similar to
the NYX err palette yeah they do kind of
that's true
and then buy any of those the NYX pilots
when they came out I thought about it i
swatched them a generation Beauty the
zoom duh
it seemed nice Megan says Lancome
shadows kind of suck but then I see Java
says I love Lancome foundation I
especially hate their eyeshadow they
just don't feel yeah I have to say my
shadows
yeah Priscilla says Laurent Camacho's
remind me of Mary Kay yes exactly I feel
the same way I didn't have good luck
with Mary Kay eyeshadows either I didn't
try it at one point
okay this was one that's gonna be a
little difficult for me to pass on
because reviews are so good on this this
is the Christian palette I've thought
about getting this and thought about
getting this but honestly I don't think
people are gonna be diggin on a review
at this point because this was out to a
lot of influencers and now that I can
purchase it I feel like people are gonna
be done with it because I will be able
to review it for like at least another
week or two even though they were
reviews were
on it I don't like the urban decay has
this much space between their shadows I
don't like that I wish that they didn't
do that with some of their palettes
where they leave all that space I don't
think it looks good aesthetically it
just isn't pretty to me I like them to
be a little bit more organized that's
just the game it makes my brain go all
wonky like when I look at this can't but
it makes my brain short-circuits like I
can't read it but their reviews on this
are so good so good all right what's up
with Amy when you see what's going on
with Amy Amy needs something they find
her or Amy the box of crayons we're
gonna get to that when we get to the arm
indie we're not it into yet hold on hang
tight it's in there and it's actually
the box of crayons is almost toward the
end of Indy so we're gonna get that all
right next one okay this is I think the
laughs yeah this is the last one from
the mainstream brands and then we're
getting into ND so this is the nude
sticks rock and roller
easy easy eyeliner ink and it looks like
this it reminds me of a Maybelline
mascara or a covergirl mascara
Maybelline cuz with the pink kind of
reminds me of a Maybelline mascara with
their wouldn't think what do they call
it tag the they call it millennial Pig
there you go millennial pink it's a
roller wheel I've had bad luck with the
rolling little thing so this is gonna be
an ocean from these things but I
appreciate the thought with the little
roller wheel that you roll on your
eyeliner it's a nice idea but it's just
no really
okay luminol okay there was one more
that I added at the last minute the
makeup revolution concealer I think I'm
going to purchase it I did purchase at
Beauty bakery I got some stuff I got in
one of the concealers I got one of the
eyeshadow palettes and I did get the
translucent flour baking powder or
whatever they called the flour powder I
did get that so I was thinking about
doing a comparison between the you know
kind of talking education educated an
educated way about the new makeup
revolution concealer and the Beauty
bakery one compared to the heart-shaped
tape and kind of talked about the three
different formulas and what
they're all life that was my idea behind
and then I just bought some extra stuff
from the bakery just to try it the stuff
that I've gotten from Beauty bakery
before I actually didn't really like I
didn't really like the liquid lipsticks
and I didn't really like the ice cream
palette very much I didn't find it to be
very fun to work with the formula I just
wasn't creamy enough it wasn't pigmented
enough like it just it just didn't look
there's some some eyeshadows they just
make me feel happy when I use the maybe
it just wasn't making me happy so I gave
a break on three Beauty bakery for a
while but I'm ready to dive back
anti-fur great things about the new
eyeshadow palette so I'm gonna try that
but I think like a three way video would
be good like to talk about the tart
shape tape the makeup revolution one and
the bakery one as like alternatives to
the tart shape tape if you were trying
to move on from that so so anyway okay
so now we're moving on to actually me
okay so this is the Sigma Beauty they
came out with these crazy-looking
brushes and I think they're very
interesting I don't know if they're
necessary but I think that they're
interesting if I didn't have so many
brushes I think I might be interested in
these just because they're different I
think they're kinda cool Miriam wants to
know if I've tried the milk makeup
concealer now I have it
Alena wants to know if it's an altar yet
I think that it's beginning of February
it's dropping at Ulta in-store Jessica
wants no from makeup revolution is
drugstore it is drugstore priced yes
it's considered a drugstore price to
read but I think it's actually sold in
drugstores so they sell it at Ulta and
then in the not prestige section so I
mean technically they're considered
drugstore all right so now let me go to
the next one so the Sigma brushes I'm
like yet if I wasn't swimming in brushes
I think they're really unique and fun
okay color pop eyeshadows you just wanna
take a second to talk about color pop
it's constantly coming out to you I
shall use new super shocks hi honestly
like I never reached for my my club
eyeshadow they're probably all bad at
this point and I just don't have fun
using my kholokov eyeshadows
they were just not enjoyable to use I
think they're cool I give them
serious serious credit for coming up
with a really cool unique formula but I
just don't use them like this the glue
ones that have glitter around leave
glitter all over my face like the other
ones like the ones that are more like
satiny I really like but just the
application of them is just ear to me I
don't I don't like them but I could see
why a lot of other people really do
enjoy them it's just not my thing you
know like Priscilla loves them Milagros
loves them Devin says colour-pop needs
to smoke down compassionate living color
pop releases are out of control julissa
is pretty but no and I agree I think
these shades are really pretty and me
Marnie says she bought four of the new
super shops Krista says I only go for
the pressed powder for them Susan says I
love color pop times so over at there so
over saturating themselves you're coming
out with so many new releases so many
ways things kind of crazy but but yeah
I'm just not I'm kind of deep on this
formula even though I can see why people
really like it but Stef says I'm waiting
for the Lux lipstick oh my gosh my girl
shade from that girl Shay she did a
video of all the lip swatches there were
like six or seven of them I was like
that's pretty he did a really nice job
picking off the shades they're very good
at picking out shades big red says hi
everyone cover FX is on HauteLook right
now thank you so much for that I
appreciate it all right let me go to the
next one because we only have like 20
minutes left so this I was actually very
intrigued by I thought that the shade
selection was really neat and I give
make a few credit for this this is the
Mardi Gras spoiled kid I was really
thinking about getting this but then I
thought about am I actually gonna use
these cuz I'm not gonna review it but I
actually use these shades and I probably
really wouldn't I mean this might be a
great alternative if you weren't looking
for because if you didn't want to get
the Kat Von D one look it's not that new
young cream in there I wonder how they
would compare but I think it's a really
cool color selection I think that she
did a really nice job you know figuring
out something different to do I mean in
the pan like in the picture like these
two shades back here and like they look
kind of similar I'm sure they're
different this one looks deeper but but
yeah I think she did a nice job trying
to do something different
makes me happy Shelly's here from Shelly
saves the day Shelly another one of my
favorite smaller youtubers oh my gosh I
these colors really are beautiful I know
I'm like like I mean Sarah says I love
makeup you oil shadows me too me too
very much Susan says can someone explain
HauteLook is it knockoffs expiring
products I don't get it
I believe well HauteLook has changed a
little bit over the years
Holt look is immortal company so think
like Nordstrom Rack so they get um some
products our products that I think that
the brand is discontinuing its just
overstock of products that they're
trying to get rid of I think that
sometimes but then sometimes smaller
companies will sell their stock at a
discounted price in order to get more
exposure at least that's what I believe
so
if not always products that are just
going out of stock I think the bigger
brands a lot of times times it is like
if you look like the selections from Mac
and Lowell Rock and brands like that
like they you'll see that it looks like
products they're just trying to get rid
of but then you'll see like Julia's
place on there you'll see a lot of
k-beauty brands on there that it looks
like they're just trying to get more
exposure through whole looks so I don't
think they're not supposed it's not
supposed to be expired stuff I mean it's
a Nordstrom brand it shouldn't be
selling expired stuff just like ignore
stone that stuff should not be expired
even though I've heard of bad things
happening at like TJ Maxx and Marshalls
I hardly heard as much from Nordstrom
Rack you guys off to tell me if you've
heard anything about that oh no what do
you fear next says hautelook often does
terrible packaging to it so many things
are I've broken I stopped ordering from
them no I actually have only ever had
one thing arrive broken it was the very
first thing I ever bought look and it
was a pixie eye shadow cause right when
pixie was brand new and the black was
broken shattered everywhere but they
replaced it for me no questions asked
so yeah I love whole look I I buy a lots
of stuff also look I bought clothes off
mote look a lot of clothes a lot of my
clothes are from home look and Amazon
it's a lot of online shopping all right
let's move on to the next thing
yeah Alena says who have said I was
gonna be born that I didn't like I won't
look is always different always having
products caskets trip alright these are
from a brand that I absolutely love this
is on MBA cosmetics M as in monster be a
Cosmo the unicorn kisses glitter gel is
this something that I'm not interested
in from them I don't know what I would
do with a glitter gel I just have no use
for that it's like an aloe base gel and
they put glitter in it and you can use
it as body gel can use it if the hair
gel this is just something I have
absolutely no use for but I think it's
cool but I don't need your support so
this is gonna be amazing
unfortunately even though I do really
love this red OH
okay so next up speaking of Nancy for my
for Nancy's birthday Nancy bought us a
present the next one is what Nancy
bought me and her for for her birthday
this is the dominie cosmetics latte
palette so I would really really love to
do a review on that I'm hoping I get it
fast enough that I can do a review on it
before everybody else in their
grandmother does a review but I really
think she did a nice job with the colors
I'm adding in the blue and the purple
and you take the blue and the purple out
it's like literally Los Angeles palette
no it's not it's actually quite
different in the top row kind of this
little reminiscent of Laura stop then
you've got these cooler prints and stuff
down here but you're definitely
different I was just making a joke is a
bad joke but yeah if you take these out
it looks a little bit more ordinary but
then when you pull hmm oh the next one
when you pull those put those back in it
really does look much more unique so I'm
very excited about this I'm very excited
to try for formula I'm I am one I'm
always rooting for people that start
independent makeup brands I think that
it's amazing to follow your dream and
create something out of nothing no
matter what it is whether it's makeup
whether it's some other product whether
it's art my husband's an artist whenever
you're creating something out of nothing
I think that that's absolutely amazing
so I am all for supporting youtubers who
venture out to do things like for
example like a shirt I brought I bought
some Taylor merch from that Tayla I
bought
necklace from Mallory I bought you know
all kinds of stuff over the years from
people so I'm all about supporting
people that are starting things I'm very
excited to try this and see how it goes
but who's gonna be honest but you know
I'm rooting for it I'm really hoping
that it's good but I'm still gonna be
honest about it you guys know me okay
Caleb must know if I still use my
lauralee palette honestly I don't reach
for it much it's not because it's not
good quality it's just the colors don't
hold me you know it's a very nice
palette it just it doesn't call me so no
I don't really use it to be honest with
you I don't and I've used that thing
maybe two or three times since I did the
review I mean I have a lot of palettes
and testing a lot of college but I
honestly don't reach for that much Lucy
wants to know what I'm gonna do my top
rushes I'll tell you right now
Moda and Luxy done Mona Luxy and beauty
junkies those are my favorites but I
guess I could go into like what I use
for different purposes and things I've
done that in the past and that's a
possibility
all right next up these are really
interesting this is a brand called clean
color these are the mega watts liquid on
shadows and these if I remember
correctly are very very very inexpensive
I think this whole brand is very
inexpensive let me go to clean color I
want to see how much these are KL e a n
co lor I always do eyeshadow so it comes
out clean color okay they have palettes
where are the sticky things hmm
Oh what's new let's go to there what's
now it's KL EAN color oh here we go mega
watts they're a dollar and they come in
a lot of shades three six nine 12 13 14
15 16 shades glitter chrome effects long
wearing drive down smooth where's
comfortably there in dollar earth
seriously
well those look cool Oh tabatha force
now just told me she knows the stuff
it's so much fun super cool okay then
one more
we've got two more until we get to the
box of crayons okay we'll get that
everybody what started box grams we'll
get there okay this one is going to be a
huge huge No
like not even a hesitation no more V 24
G palette no no Jen says can you do a
video on smaller YouTube channels to
follow I've already filmed it I wanted
it to go up tomorrow but I don't think
it's gonna be ready it's already filmed
it's my next video
yes this is a no okay this is the thing
about marketing and I feel like I don't
get it I just don't I don't get it
like how many shades of brown do we need
like really and truly every palette this
50 shades of brown every why why does
this exist I don't get it I don't get it
at all and I know as youtuber it's
probably not in my financial best
interests to always be talking smack
about morphe but I don't care it's this
stupid to me it's stupid to me like
brown it's all it is it's always just
brown all the time you know 24 a Browns
2014 Brown just 24 cebreiro
news 2016 Browns 38 our Browns come on
man please give me some I mean there's
like a pink in there there's a couple of
Reds in there but I just can't even with
them but this is the thing people buy it
a lot of people buy it so they must know
something I don't
because they're doing way better in
their lives that I says they must be
doing some
right whose people buying it I don't get
it then I don't get all right Melissa
want someone's anybody trot you stinky
wears cosmetics I do eyeshadow palettes
I think there's cosmetics you're good
you're not fabulous but they're good I
definitely wouldn't say yes you need
them in your life they're good
if one calls to you I would say you
might have some fun with it so yeah
that's the way I feel about it all right
next up three Brooke cosmetics secret
garden brush set if I didn't have a
stupid amount of brushes I would get
this because I think those are beautiful
they're so fun I don't need that in my
life
plus I don't I know that they are
probably thinking this brush color would
be good because it's um you know it
looks nice for the rest of the brush but
I personally don't like face brushes
that are white because when I use them
for foundation when I use them for blush
it's like they get dirty so fast and
they just look really bad especially
like the flat kabuki like that just gets
caked up and it's really hard to clean
those kinds of brushes because the
brushes are so densely packed together I
find them extremely hard to get
completely clean and we're light-colored
like this it just always looks
disgusting forever and forever and ever
amen
you know so that's that's the big reason
why I'm nothing to get these but I think
that the handles are gorgeous and it's
really hard for me not to buy them and
Melissa says but do they work on him
I'm simply Bonnie says and not too big
on the flowers like that I like it
oh hi Bonnie Bonnie says I only have one
more for you Jacqueline Helen I do love
it
hey Jaclyn hill palette formula I've
said this a million times is a different
formula it's set for there's some
smaller can ones and I forget which size
it's in my Jacquelyn home video that
it's the same form of those those but
the morphe has so many different
formulas there's like four or five
different formulas that they use so um
I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna
Melissa says yeah I think white bristles
are beautiful but yeah hard to clean yes
Carla I talked about the Geoffrey start
collection I'm not purchasing it but I
wish everybody well it does I
see why people would enjoy it but it's
not going to be on me I'm not gonna get
that one they said are you getting a lot
a pallet already been purchased not by
me my friend Nancy bought it for me for
her birthday cuz she's amazing
so but but yeah I love these brushes
totally bit trying to get back on topic
all right next one here it comes
are you ready for it you ready the box
of crayons okay I'm thinking about
getting this because it looks like so
much fun
and it's an indie brand and I watched a
video of their launch party and they
were just so like you could just tell it
was such a passion project you know like
the people there it's just like her and
all her friends and everybody's just so
proud of her like it just reminded me of
like just a good old party of a bunch of
friends you know that some of these
launch parties it's like this celebrity
and this big youtuber and this person
and that person like she had a bunch of
music artists there they were like local
to her community and like it was her and
her friends you had her table laid out
and everything and it just looked like
you know this is somebody following
their dream you know and it just gives
me chills just thinking about it and I
just felt so happy watching that video
and like just saying you know what this
is somebody that's doing it this is
someone that had a passion and had a
dream she went after it and she made
this makeup company and it was like I
don't know it just it just warmed my
heart so I think this is really really
really cute it they're all it says
they're all named after crayons but
don't get too excited because they're
not the most exciting news like for
example the yellow I wish she named it
macaroni and cheese because macaroni and
cheese was like my favorite crayon color
you know but they're all you know it's a
credd yellow black brown tan pink purple
like they're just named after the you
know regular baby blue they're not like
the fun crayon colors they're like the
typical crayon colors but that's okay I
think that it's the heart behind it let
me see crayon case Cosmetics is the name
of the brand let's see it just came out
it was in the show this week
yes I believe is in the show this week
okay the website takes a little while to
load but yeah I mean and the shades are
really really pretty I think it'll be
fun so I'm thinking about getting this
one which isn't says Jen can I just say
your skin girl you're going and you but
oh thank you my forehead wrinkles are
coming back I haven't been taking care
of my anti-aging so I've been doing my
moisturizer but I haven't been doing
like all my anti-aging like exfoliation
chemical exfoliating stuff lately so my
wrinkles are coming back but hopefully I
can get back to my exfoliation and get
it back you know you look at yourself
you know and you're more critical of
yourself than other people might be okay
so I got to the website it's the boxy
prints palette is $30 and it is
currently on sale you can add it to your
bag right now it's 18 colors so yeah so
I'm excited about it I think I'm gonna
purchase this up I'm gonna leave that
window open and just buy it after this
because I just want to support her she
just like the video just won my heart
you know and I think it would be fun I
think this would be really really fun to
play with and I love that she included
some neutral shades in there as well to
kind of I'm not neutral but like more
like skintone colors like his Browns
over here and like this like goldish
color here to kind of balance out that
bright the brightness and its quote she
included some of those that's really
thick
I'm excited all right next up dubious
place this is what I'm not and this one
is not lying to me I love jus this place
but this one is not home today
it's just that again I don't like Reds
ornament so this one is just not not
feeling this one this one oh it's called
I was bought it for the festival palette
I was really excited when I saw the
packaging and I think it's cool that
they're doing liquid lipsticks now this
one's just not calling to me hmmm I'm
sure that it's great follow me amber
says a Lisa Frank collection I ordered
that Lisa Frank collection on the
Kickstarter
a year ago fall of I ordered it fall of
2016 I ordered that Lisa Frank
collection I speak like $75 for that
Lisa Frank collection they haven't seen
single darn thing nothing nothing I'm
knocking they'll gonna be like dude am I
ever gonna get my stuff because this is
crazy like it's going on sale on stores
and stuff like all the stuff and I
started on my Kickstarter stuff only
what's going on
but anyway anyway I'm not probably under
that this fbh wants to know my favorite
julius place palette whoo they change
the formula after the original nubian so
if you want to try Oh like I would say
stay away from the original movie and
palette even though it's good it's not
as good as the other ones I probably say
masquerade it is my favorite I really
like the clothes in masquerade that
one's really fun it's really really fun
but yeah so this one I probably oh I I'm
trying to sound this out do my do me
tries this do me tries this I picked up
some Lisa Frank vfc I'm not impressed
oh how much is the judy is one I would
imagine it's like 25 bucks let's look it
up I'm gonna open up a new window
because I don't want to lose my crayon
box genius Queens 2150 and the
masquerade pallidus 20 phone wave the
magic palette is also really good I just
thought that was not that long ago so I
have as much experience with that one
that one's 25 but but yeah I would say I
don't know I mean they're the formula is
so consistent I would say just yet which
one um just get whatever one calls to
you the most because they're really
pretty consistent except for the
original medium palette which was a
different format okay so it is now six
o'clock I'm one minute over but I also
babbled for like 6 minutes before this
started so I'm just gonna finish this up
we've got two more products the
storybook cosmetics liquid lipsticks
collector edition this is from the
wizardry and witchcraft lipstick
collection I'm not going to get these
there's one shade in here that I might
use so for the price which I think it's
like $50 this is not worth it to me
I just watched my son broke my pop
socket yeah my pop sockets broken and I
know I didn't break it for that what's
the make up pop socket it's got a big
old crack in it well I'm gonna get him a
$6 it's coming out in the lounge buy me
a new pop star get anyway here you go
I'm not buying that kid so I would only
use like one shade out of it I haven't
tried to do so palette couldn't suelo if
it's real I want to know about the new
spot I haven't tried it so that's why I
can't um I can't speak to him yeah he's
not really in that much of trouble I'm
just gonna bring it out to her and be
like dude you broke my pop socket that's
it my six-year-old alright last one
which I think I'm gonna pass on this but
from what I know of this for me this is
the BH Cosmetics conversation parts
palette if you like glitter and you
don't mind using a glitter glue there
press glitters that mva cosmetics are so
good so good Bonnie I got the pop socket
at pop sockets with pops up it website
that's where I got them but yeah this is
really good this formula is really good
I haven't tried of course this tailored
palette but I tried they requested
before and I really liked their formula
it's basically just like a bunch of um I
guess it's like time at the cone or
something that holds all the glitter
together so when you brush your finger
against it it just gives you the
beautiful like sleep swatch of glitter
and just really opaque for a loose
glitter blitz pressed but but it's
glittery it's not a shadow it's an
actual glitter so you need a glitter
glue you have to have a glitter glue but
if you like those at all these are
probably really really good I don't
think I'm you get them so those were all
the pictures I had anybody else have any
uh no Kristen says her son brokers to go
people anyone else have any questions
about any before I pop off here I'm
gonna stay on for like another one or
two minutes um Jenna says even see like
glitter gets my eyes Oh Kelly says I'm
wanting to try the Jake at Beauty
metallic eyeliners especially the purple
one nice eye
some hit and miss experiences with Jake
have you need a lot of really good stuff
though it's going very fast I have never
tried a Lexus Vogel I don't know Alexis
Vogel and then the talk about that one
Shelly says she loves the Stila glitters
yes I'm gonna say a proced a freest says
glitter on the idealist glitter on the
face a lot of times a lot of times and
I'm really like I've used the I have the
Fenty beauty palette the one with all
the glittery shades in it and I think
I'm giving up on that when I think I'm
gonna return it because like it doesn't
look good by the end of the day I've
litter fall out everywhere it's just not
a good palette
Shen's don't want to know what I think
of nude sticks I love their crayons
their lip crayons I think they're
fabulous they're really good they're
really nice lasting power and they
they're really smooth I do not own
ChaCha I do not own the feet a bit who'd
put a beauty desert dust palette I own
one of her the little ones the knife and
little ones and I like it it's good

Charlie says Jen can you give us a quick
sneak peek of your upcoming reviews
because I'm not sure what I'm gonna
review I have a bunch of things that I
want to review but the thing is I don't
see on so I'm trying to not buy things
and have them stack up because what ends
up happening is I end up with like three
or four things and then like for example
the Too Faced chocolate bar palette by
the time I could have reviewed it
everybody was kind of done with it
so I kind of shot myself in the foot
there by buying too many products review
so I kind
I'm waiting until I know I can review
something and then just buying things
one at a time I definitely want to
review the dominie Cosmetics latte
palette that's definitely on my list but
other than that I don't really have
anything that I'm like okay this is
something one reviewing at least right
now because it's just I don't I'm over
purchased the law last year and I'm this
year I really want to not purchase as
much because I'm kind of swimming and
stuff and it's a waste it's a waste when
it comes down to especially when I never
got to reveal it it's a waste if I got
to review it that's one thing or if it's
something that's like I'm gonna use it
for the dupes or something like that
that's one thing but if it's just a
condom never you know we've got again to
wait Wanda wants to know what I think of
the AVH new palette I wished the
included new all new shades kind of bums
me out that there's like three peat
shades in there
Julian was not tied to a roundup video
Emily oh you know I was done some um
what do you mean by that jeweling
roundup video I'm not sure what that
means
rediscovered favorites that's a good
idea kind of new here it's a good idea
we just our favorites I could do
something like that you put that on the
list wouldn't be next weeks I really
have my videos set for next week Oh
Denise video ideas take them in right
now we discovered favorites that way I
don't forget if I don't read it down
right now
Oh deep on forever see okay all right
I'm gonna go ahead and pop off here
because I need to go make my kids dinner
at six or seven they're probably
starving right now and I'm not feeding
them and not take care of them and you
don't feed your kids then that's really
really a bad thing and I need to feed
them well we ate a late lunch we ate
lunch at like 2:30 something like that
so they shouldn't even I'm not that
hungry but and they can only get
something if they really need to I
should like you can see something
um so yeah thank you so much for me I
hope you had fun definitely if you're
