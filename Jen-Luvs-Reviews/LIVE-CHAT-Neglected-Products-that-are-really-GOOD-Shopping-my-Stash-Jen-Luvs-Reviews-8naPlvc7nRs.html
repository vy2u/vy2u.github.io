the make up chat it's so good to have
you here I really like doing these chats
these really are a lot of fun so I'm
happy to have you here today I was
thinking I was looking through some
posts on the Ipsy OS which is the
creator's little forum on a Facebook
that if she has somebody was talking
about the NYX Avant pop palette man has
a really good palette I have that
palette I don't ever use that palette
and I just I just realized this there's
some product that I've been neglecting
because I you know as a YouTube reviewer
makeup reviewer I'm constantly buying
like the newest and the latest like hot
item or whatever and then I have to test
it so I spend a good week using the
products that I've tested you know that
I've bought waiting for - can I speak
today I use the products that I bought
for like that entire week you know
trying to test it to wait for the review
so the products that I previously
reviewed aren't getting used because I'm
busy using the new product so that I can
review them for the channel so there's a
lot of products that I have in my
collection then there are really great
products just haven't been using them
lately so since I haven't been talking
about them and I do own them I wanted to
show them to you because some of them
are available now some of them aren't
but you might own them and realize hey
I've been neglecting that product too
maybe I should break it out so yeah so
that's what we're gonna be talking about
today have that whole table full of
stuff here to chat about so but before
we do before we do we're gonna go ahead
and say hello to the collective brain of
makeup boss and this also known as the
people who are here in the live chat if
you're watching this on the replay you
are also part of the collective brain of
makeup awesomeness we're gonna learn
from you by typing a comment down in the
section below in the comment section and
telling us about some of the products
that you love that maybe you haven't
been using in a while for whatever
reason so that we can learn some other
products that are great that we should
go out and purchase so that's how the
collective brain works you all work
together so that we can buy products
that are awesome and stay away from
products that are terrible so we're
gonna be mostly talking about awesome
products today let me go ahead and say
hello to the people who are actually in
the live chat because it's just nice to
say hello when you're in a room with
people it's just nice
say hello so if you're in the room but
it's not live go ahead and fast-forward
a little bit
fast-forward a little bit and then we'll
get into the product in the view so let
me go ahead and say hello to Michelle
one of our reporters good morning
Michelle the morning - Stephanie the
morning let's see Michelle says trying
to finish up the news before the chat
starts I know maybe I should make the
news be a little bit later good morning
to the gold-digger good morning to
Katharine downing go check out her
YouTube channel
good morning Jennie suit the morning
Snape's trying to eat Carolyn good

Sheryl good morning from Alabama

good morning Trish she's drinking water
in the morning which is what we probably
all should be doing
good morning Brianna and Mary and
Stevie's girl she said she can't wait
for the Papa don't preach blushes oh my
god I saw one that looks like a pie are
you kidding me are you kidding me if you
haven't seen the poppin off peach
blushes that Jared glaze uniform Too
Faced have leaked the picture there's
something there's pictures in the news
the one that looks like a pie that one
gets me counting against me I I'm gonna
have to swatch on to see but that one
gets me if they even let him get that
far they might just get like peach
palette on them he wouldn't do that
though do you think he would do that do
you think he would just make it like the
peach palette and like do a limited
release and not only everybody get him
so now it's like I was hurt no I wasn't
hurt but a lot of people were hurt my
two faces they couldn't get the peach
palette so now I'm a little bit because
I got mine but you guys get what I'm
trying to say so I worry about those
limited religious releases hopefully he
makes enough of them good morning let's
see oh oh it skipped down a little bit
oh I missed I missed a bunch of things
okay somehow I miss if I didn't say good
morning to you somehow it slipped down
and I missed it so good morning if you
work here and I did not say good morning
good morning to you Mel says it's her
first time watching live Felicia says
she was hurt I know I know I feel you I
feel you one though Briana were you hurt
- I don't know about I don't know how I
feel about the better together yeah it's
a little oh she had more stuff in it you
know more shadows give me more shadows
you know all right good morning good
morning Stephanie she's a cat Fonzie did
a bit of an explanation about the
product selling out something about
warehouse storage stuff like et cetera
so I'm not accurate that is oh no good
morning in Romania alright so let's go
ahead and talk about some of these
products I'm gonna go ahead and start
with some of the primer products
eyeshadow primer products then they were
really really good watch the ones a face
primer once an eyeshadow primer that are
really really good I've totally been
neglecting this one is the Mirabella
crime for a face face primer it is a
silicon based primer but if you like
silicon these primers this one's a
really really good one I got this in a
subscription box is actually the second
one that I've owned and it's just a
really great face primer it feels good
to go on another thing maybe the blast
on when I wear it and I have seen a
difference with this one some face
primers not only see much of a
difference I've seen a difference with
this one so definitely a yes on the
Mirabella face primer I don't know if
anybody else has ever tried this but
it's great it's a little hard to get
access to it though because they don't
sell it in regular stores that I know of
I think you have to buy it from the
Mirabella website sometimes you can find
Mirabella on HauteLook so yes and then
the this one is one that's a little bit
more accessible this is the Urban Decay
anti-aging eyeshadow primer potion and
this I actually saw a reduction in the
wrinkles on my eyelids when I use this
religiously when I'm used it every
single day which is really really weird
I was shocked I was like are you kidding
me
like I I could really seriously tell the
difference and I was so surprised so
surprised but I haven't been using it
much because I've been using my orbital
cache our primary and eating this one
does not have any new
of discoloration it's very similar in
formula the way that it looks to the
original primer potion but this one has
those anti-aging you know benefits in
there so if you are looking for some cat
eye aging this is definitely one I
recommend because it's got all the
benefits of the urban decay eyeshadow
primer
but also has the anti aging stuff in it
- it's really good
let's see Laura says the morning even
though it's late here in Australia thank
you so much for joining us hello dawn
she says hi I have that one - I've never
tried it Felicia says she has it Carolyn
says I got a sample of lorac eye primary
my eye CO and I really like it oh really
use it more than my Mac Paint Pot in my
prep and prime eyeshadow primer really
because that one did not work for me
Wow boots and lace says you can use your
points for the Mirabella prime are
either box 2 trimmer glossy box good to
know thank you so much good morning
Valerie I miss you too
Felicia says doesn't work well with one
of my face primers which one Felicia
what doesn't work well with one of your
face primers I missed it
Katherine says I love that eye primer
always forget I have it be Beauty says
hi Jen its Brittany hello Brittany here
here so early this time I'm so glad that
you're here that's fantastic
Jenna says she loves her NYX white paint
pots you know NYX made a white Paint Pot
I only use the pencil and milk
interesting my shirt says will work for
coffee
is what my sure it says it's very me I
do work for coffee I love me my coffee I
do good morning to Susan and Carol and
Carolyn says I want the Urban Decay eye
primer she totally got it and a lot of
times you can find the Urban Decay at
least I've been able to find it at
Nordstrom Rack if you haven't watched a
rack around you they have they have
boxes and boxes and boxes them for half
price so definitely recommend checking
there Oh dogs trying to come up baby
come say hi real quick and then I'm
gonna have you go out because your paws
are kind of hurting me and you're a
little distracting so I will cuddle with
you later okay I know well we're gonna
send you out because I have to talk
about makeup and I really don't want
doggy hairs all in my makeup okay but I
do love you
sorry just a second Mona Sam's this
that's like say it's my baby all right
baby you ready come on come on let's pop
out he was just laying there for a
minute but now he's gone
hey John will you call Sam there we go
daddy he'll give him some love all right
so oh he's such a sweetheart
he is a Britney by the way don't
sometimes people call him Britney
spaniels but he is a Britney is what
they technically call them very close to
us paying almost anything anyway back to
makeup okay another thing that I neglect
a lot is my powder foundations I told
that these are great products and I just
neglect them all the time this is the
cocoa powder foundation by toothpaste
and then this is the laura geller
ballets baked balance and breton
foundation this one is a little bit dark
for me which means I should be using it
like right now I should be using it
because because it's a little dark for
me I'm a little bit I've been out in the
Sun a little bit so you know so I need
to use these more these are great
products these are wonderful if you have
like a BB cream and you want to just
bump up the coverage just a little bit
this is a great way to do that I haven't
found any powder foundations to be of
medium to full coverage usually these
are of light to medium coverage on their
own but when added them with a tinted
moisturizer a BB cream it really does
bump up the coverage of it so they're
really nice for that and that's totally
been neglecting them and then of course
this one smells like chocolate doesn't
smell as much like chocolate is what I
bought it but it still smells like
chocolate it's really really good so
love love love love love these alright
let's see in in order okay I have a lot
of on shadow palettes because I shot it
was kind of my thing you know I just got
there not everybody but probably most
people that are really in the makeup
have their thing that they look
typically it's either lipstick or
eyeshadow I feel like those are the two
things that people it's kind of their
thing some people it's blush but most
people I feel like it's lipstick Russia
for me it's eye shadow that's my thing
so I'm constantly buying the washed out
of college which palettes which means I
neglect a lot of eyeshadow palettes so
the first
palate that I want to talk about and
I've been neglecting they're really
really good art my lorac palettes I
haven't used one of these lorac pellets
in probably two months and it's sad
because they're amazing palettes are
really really good for ones that you can
no longer get I do have the lorac Pro
original and the mega Pro the lorac mega
Pro original and the lorac mega pro 2
the original was amazing I'm waiting for
the rocks to be smart enough to release
this I don't know why they don't if I
was their marketing director I would be
like dude we need to make more of these
and we need to sell them like this is
probably the most comprehensive amazing
palette that I own as far as neutral
shadows like it is just it's perfect in
my opinion perfect as far as the shade
range oh my gosh Sarah says that mega
Pro is my unicorn I know and that's why
I think lorac is absolutely stupid for
not reviewing this and putting this out
again look I don't know why they
wouldn't there has to be a reason
something that I am ignorant of there
has to be a reason why because it's
amazing
the only thing about lorac shadows is
they do kick up powder when you when you
put your brush in they do kick powder so
you just have to be very gentle when you
talk your brush in them with their
beautiful wonderful smooth shadows there
they're really great and just this
palette I got so lucky to get this I had
someone in my community that I was
following on I was following her on
Instagram and she posted on her
Instagram that this was on Amazon and I
jumped every Amazon I bought it and it
was because I was following someone in
the community that I have just happen to
get this so really really really really
really glad to have that I also have the
- which was a little bit underwhelming
compared you know I mean it's nice but
compared I mean this is this ain't
nothing compared to the original you
know as far as the shade range I mean
but I mean quality wise is the same it's
the rock Pro formula but the shade range
is just weird compared to that one
you've got bright blues and um collard
greens and golds and purples and oranges
like it's just strange
it's a strange combination and then
you've got this weird light section over
here that makes absolutely no sense to
me why in the world you would have one
two three four five six shades seven
really I mean that's just Oh just I
don't know what they were thinking doing
that many super light shades it just
doesn't make any sense it makes no sense
to me but the quality shadows is
fantastic I also have the I don't think
this is available anymore than lorac
mega the metals palette this is really
nice as a little supplemental palette if
you happen to run across this I think
they were how should that cost Sabrina
wants to know and honestly I can't
remember it's been a really really
really long time I can't remember how
much they were I want to say they were
like 60 bucks or something like that
65 can't remember if anybody knows how
much they cost
put it in the chat because I can't
remember but I know that they were
significantly more maybe this one right
here the mega pros I think we're like 65
something like that yeah and I think
Carolyn I do think this was like 28
something like that um but yeah so this
here fantastic fantastic quality I love
the shimmer on these but this is just a
really nice yet $28 for the small
pellets this is just a really nice
little supplemental color if you want
just like a nice metallic pop it was 60
thank you so much Keisha I appreciate
that I thought it was somewhere around
there which is a fantastic deal for all
of those shadows especially considering
I think these are like 44 45 something
like that I do have the original lorac
Pro this one my sister-in-law gave me
because it didn't work for her and
honestly I don't I I don't reach for it
as much as nearly as much as I should I
really feel like this here is more of
for reference purposes than for me
actually using it because it's like I
don't know why I don't reach for this I
don't have anybody else feels that way
about the original lorac Pro palette I
actually reached more for the throw to
then I do for the original procow which
is strange because I like the original
mega Pro and
as much did ii mega pro but I don't like
the original pro but I'm like the second
pro hi Lisa
how are you gesture she tried to slow
down the pallet mine yes I hear you
by the way tab that says everyone
subscribed to be beauty and be sure to
bug her when she says axe not ask lol
okay be Beauty we all need to subscribe
Vee Beauty got it tabatha Jesus says I
had the lorac Pro to go and I love the
bronzer that's included I don't have
that one
Carolyn says Anasazi Beverly Hills is
one of the best ever made and you know
what I don't know any Anasazi ah I shut
it off but I will soon because Nancy is
kind enough that she's gonna be sending
me the modern renaissance palette which
I saw off topic for a second I saw the
modern renaissance palette is being
compared to the violet and balls Holy
Grail talent so I think that's what one
thing I'm going to do with it is I want
to see how close those two things those
two are very curious to see what happens
with that beauty haul score woman hey
bats how are you
she says she reaches for the pro two
more than the original as well gotcha
alright so loving this I really love
this section over here a lot just
there's this those colors just make me
happy they make me happy in my heart
like these two right here actually these
three is for this section is a little
weird for me but like this right here is
money right there
Souza says the modern Renaissance tile
is amazing oh I'm so excited so say I
haven't I've never owned Anasazi
eyeshadows it's just a brand that I
hadn't gravitated towards um you know
it's really expensive and I got burned
on there liquid lipsticks the original
formula I hated it the brow products I
feel like on the whole are bit
overpriced because I have other products
that aren't Anasazi and that I like
better so I've always been like Anasazi
of kind and also you know I wouldn't
want a product super hyped on YouTube
now I kind of let go
maybe it's not so great I don't know do
you do that when you want a product is
super light thudding YouTube I don't
know sometimes it makes me think twice
you know but but everybody's telling you
about the modern Renaissance College so
I'm here that's gonna be a good one i
Tami says oh really go to them using the
right name for you what's a really good
travel palette let me show you if I have
a travel which I did I did travel with
more than one palette but the Urban
Decay Naked basics 2 is a fantastic
palette for travel I'm not sure what
your skin tone is so I don't I'm not
positive of how this would work with
your particular skin tone but man this
is a really good count it just it has
everything in it to complement a very
simple matte look just to pull something
out nice for for reading nice for just a
very simple easy daytime look boots and
laces no way to mana residence how it
blows a pilot falls out of the water the
shades are similar but the quality is
like L'Oreal versus Tom Ford we're gonna
do a test we're gonna do a test Tracy
says did you hit pan or anything while
traveling with limited makeup Newton and
never hit pan I never do it's like I
don't think I was a single eyeshadow on
my entire collection that I could pan on
house it's sad it's sad list says I do
feel that way if they feel their sponsor
whenever one always all of a sudden
loves it minor Renaissance is nicely
pigmented with lots of red orange colors
which are super super popular right now
these red ones
alright so let's get out of high-end
land for a minute and let's get into
drugstore lamb says baa says baa says I
bought the serpentina palette and
reminds me of the look of violent boss
I'm surprised I haven't heard that one
hyped up more it's so pretty love Kat
Von D I love I love most of Kat Von D's
eyeshadow palette some of my god I've
been a little
Timmy says I'm yellow tone fair with
brown eyes but I really need a good eye
shadow palettes I don't take too much
I'm much I'm a makeup hoarder well what
you can do is bring this and then bring
one that has like maybe something like
this you're not this because this is has
a lot of neutrals in it too but it's
something that has a little bit more
color in it and then bring this as my
club you know with a little supplemental
it's a compliment you know and then you
can just use this if you want or use
something that has a little more color
all right speaking of drugs so let's
move into the drugstore eyeshadow
palettes I don't really need to use more
often so the first one is the wet long
comfort zone palette fantastic talent
I've heard some people have trouble with
lasting power with this I do not this is
fantastic I love this palette it's just
I love it I do wish that there were more
that this Brown in the bottom was a
matte shade I think that would be
fantastic this one here this was matte
and this was matte and then the rest
were shimmer I think I would be in a
happier place with this palette but
really is a fantastic palette this
actually would be good to complement
this because you've got your mats here
you've got your shimmers here put these
together yes
stephanie says naked 2 basics is
probably the best makeup purchase I've
ever made I know right I'm not because
it's so versatile so merciful it's
fantastic so definitely yes on that this
is by far the best wet mode eyeshadow
color that I've ever bought walking on
eggshells is also really good and some
of the limited edition ones have been
really good but some of them know
they're hitting this but that one's
really good you can find that thing
everywhere
NYX NYX is also another brain that's
very hit-or-miss for me for eyeshadows
these are two thoughts that were really
good for me the next I want pop I got
this in my generation PT swag bag I
think I got this and a slap back to do I
don't think I had purchased either of
these I think they were both I think
they're both in swag bag I think so but
they're both really good this one is the
go-to palette look how it indispensable
most of the NYX is eyeshadows I don't
like like the ones that were like in Rio
and in Paris
yeah they were not they were not good at
all how brains release products and
you'd like swatch it then that's like
this is not good like how does that even
happen I guess they're on like a time
crunch and they can't get quality good
or something I don't know I would love
to work for a makeup company and find
out how crap products even get released
like I don't I don't get it I don't this
hasn't really disappointing the
toothpaste cap when's he coming out
expected so much more I know especially
since they're both flippin geniuses
they're both makeup geniuses how did you
come up with something so underwhelming
I agree it is underwhelming like it's
just like that's it that's what it looks
like inside mm-hmm
yeah no there you go oh my Marina says
some people just like less pigmented
shadows and that's very true I am NOT
one of them
I have trouble working the shadows that
are less pigmented but you are
absolutely right and being a reviewer on
YouTube I get to learn from a lot of
people and like when I've reviewed
things like the Maybelline blushed nudes
palette I was surprised how many people
love that palette because it doesn't
have a lot of pigmentation they find it
easier to work with they can get nice
light looks for work things like that so
I know that I'm not the only woman I
know that I am not solely wait you said
again you guys know I'm saying there are
a lot of people that disagree with me
that pigmented shadows are the best way
to go so you know Lewton lace wants to
know if you tried the new L'Oreal quads
I heard they were really good but one
last night so I'm going to try it out
let me know I haven't tried them ladybug
says I didn't like those ninja talents
the I bought pop and the more neutral
one really I really liked it I felt like
the shades were great I thought they
were really easy to work with but I've
totally been neglecting it and you know
what now looking at this because it's
been neglected I have not used one two
three four five shades in this palette I
can see that there has not been a brush
in them I've used this one this one this
one this one and this one so maybe some
of these have other issues I don't know
but the shades that I've used I really
enjoy using and I need to use it more
maybe I'll use it today and then this
one's really good this one is great and
the blush and the highlight
bronzer I don't tell me I remember not
really liking the bronzer much but the
blush of the highlighter really like all
right more drugstore more drugstore
okay Genesis probably they have heavy
hands yeah some people really dig it
into the shadows so Aaron says this has
been a shame ly brutal decade for those
of us who don't want to wear warm tone
shadows oh my gosh yeah
well and especially right now there's so
much orange out there so much one and
it's only gonna get more once we hit
into fall getting those burnt orange
colors or just give me more and more and
more of them I'm telling you I'm telling
you yeah Michelle says I agree air and
I'm cool toned junkie absolutely when he
says powered makeup reminds me of the
Stardust ossified things they often look
at pictures of those next to each other
I've never looked at it together yeah
marina says is it true the Pat McGrath
is bringing back the highlighters that's
what we heard I don't know that's what
we heard Steph says I missed the biggest
National probably by Nicky's pot I want
to review Nicky's palette I am NOT like
super intrigued by it like it doesn't
call to me but I want to review it
really really bad really want to review
it I want it to be amazing I wanted to
be awesome and I want to review it so
I'm probably gonna get it all right back
to drugstore revealed and revealed
smokey by Coastal Scents these are
really great pilots especially the
revealed smokey I was surprised at how
much I love this I have reviews of these
on my channel if you on the look look
search my videos go to my videos and you
search your finally refused of both of
these I believe I know there's a review
of this one just really great quality I
have the Urban Decay smoky and this one
actually beat it out as far as I think
the power as far as pigmentation these
are used not by much not by much
just by this much but still a fantastic
palette for drugstore pricing really
really good and the original reveal
color they're revealed to was was pretty
good and the revealed three I didn't
really like much I actually ended up
giving that one away to someone who
actually really likes it but I liked
this one as well though every tour
revealed was my favorite until I got the
revealed smokey and that became my
favorite so these are both

addictive Beauty says makeup geek is

that pigmented hopefully just zone Li
goodness
his name's Tony says Jen remember the
Michael Beauty leaves pigment we got FC
back a few months back it was great for
a pop of shimmer on the lid
it's my beauty is a great brand I wish
they weren't so pleased and sense easy
how its fancy but yes I guess maybe
because I'm using a fluffier brush it
doesn't the one like that like that's
some craziness I look like that yeah a
good middle all right
speaking of blush oh one more eyeshadow
and they'll go into blush these Urban
Decay duo's this is half-baked in
twice-baked I have a couple of these
that have gotten holiday sets and the
holiday sets start coming out and you
see any of these duo Urban Decay eye
shadows single eyeshadows
these are super fab cause usually
they'll put their best colors in here so
twice baked and half baked mediate my
towel something I can't even get that
blush off all right half baked twice
baked beautiful Olivia says the naked
pigments are so pretty and those cannot
be in this video because I love them and
I use them all the time but I do have a
video coming out where they will be in
and in filming this week that I'll be
talking about the naked so make sure
you're subscribed so you don't know
which of you're here you're probably
subscribe alright blush talk about some
blush so wash their I neglect these old
wet and wild color icon blushes in what
is this head of one of these Heather so
Heather soak them for lesson thing plus
I think I didn't like quite as much this
either so colors self with Heather soap
was money money money love Heather soap
totally neglected it's fantastic blush
amazing amazing is I haven't tried any
of the new wet and wild blushes Michelle
this here set me a couple of the
highlighters they're very nice they kind
of sit on the skin but they're very nice
for drugstore highlighters I do like
them
but they definitely don't compete with
some with my higher end ones but I've
won with quite a bit and I am enjoying
using them but I have
any of the new wet Amala flushes marina
says the new formula is better really
super quiche has side effects of being a
makeup addict memory loss forgot how
pretty those are I know right
Carolyn Clinton says the best blush is
that I think are the best are NARS
Burberry tart and technique
Olivia has been sub forever thank you so
much I appreciate it and Lisa such the
new wet and wild blushes are great
beauty says I neglect blush in general
but I'm wearing it today I feel so put
together there's these that I used to
love those blushes the older I get the
less pigment I want my blushes yeah and
makes sense it makes perfect sense
perfect sense so other ones going into
high-end blushes that I neglect or just
blush palates in general I used I went
through a blush palette phase where I
just I love the idea of blush palette
and I don't reach for them I reach for
the singles I know what the single is I
know what it looks like that's what I
want to use but I have this I might need
to pass this on to somebody I've thought
about passing this on just because it's
not a lot of it has orgasm in it which
is i don't think i have orgasm anywhere
else
in my collection so it's like you should
i pass it along I don't know I thought
about passing this along and this is a
giant Laguna it's actually bigger than
full-size so I don't use this count
though and then this is an old tart
holiday talent beautiful blush eggs in
here really beautiful really like these
but on a rich one don't have a rich
bloom
Julie said to the balm in Spain blushes
that's another thing that will not make
it into this video because I use those
all the time they're amazing they're
amazing if you don't know the bomb
you're missing out girlfriend we're
missing out they should go home look I
think next month
don't be due to go on home look for a
Half Price I really want to get the meet
matrimony collet Alexis says I love
makeup geek blush as I don't own any of
them so I can't vouch for them but I've
heard good things
Cheyenne says oh my gosh I never I have
that Jenna just gave it oh no I missed
it shy Animus coughing my hand I missed
it
hold up hold up me go back up to show
yangsun fishman I just I I have that jet
I just gave it away to a friend because
I never use it
yeah there you go there you go Jill says
I know everyone uses that
guess up using the Milani blush as I've
reached them almost every day yep
Diana says it's just so much more
trouble with Pilate when this thing was
so easy and it's so funny because it's
opposite for eyeshadows I would my try
then grab an eyeshadow palette and a
single blush because how many blushes
are you gonna use it what just the one
right but eyeshadows you use a ton of
them at the same time so I I don't know
I only able to buy any more blush
palettes of course it holiday season
comes and I'll go back on it but but
yeah I don't I I need to stop buying
blush palettes because I don't end up
reaching for them and they're expensive
they're not cheap Riley says I love the
next ombre blushes which I've never
tried and sherry says I love the Milani
blush and tea rose and love love the
Rose imprint so girly yes they are
really girly I don't own any of those
either Jenna so the hourglass blushes
are amazing my friend Susan W who's a
reporter who has a YouTube channel she
really likes hourglass flushes and then
happy birthday to Kathleen Sabrina says
I didn't notice that means birthday
happy birthday Catherine
let's see mmm pancakes I heard the Ulta
blushes or dupes for makeup Keith I got
one Oates of blush for when I bought the
Miss Chen fabulous thought I got some
Ulta things and I really like the old to
blush I was shocked
as absolute shock I would love to do an
Ulta brand review I'm gonna buy some
more older stuff and do an all-too brand
review because I think people aren't
curious like they don't want to buy all
to stuff because you've heard horror
stories but I'm finding older brands got
some good stuff and I was shocked I'm
shocked i shadow palette was just kind
of made for me but the foundation I
thought is really good and the blush is
really good so I want to try some ultra
brand stuff so and then um pancake says
the Alta butter look easier nice yeah
and the lipstick was good too
all right speaking of let's get into
lipstick and you know what I'm starting
to run out of products here and we got
20 minutes left
unless I got 20 minutes worth of stuff
here oh no we can just talk about other
stuff would be run out of stuff but ran
out of progress of progress if I run out
of products speed Julie says I
dork Carlos women will blush yeah in
Bali
yes I forget the one that I really like
it's like the big Cabana or something oh
now I forgot what it's called
please look uh
all color it's really pretty boots and
lace the new lorac blushes are really
amazing that's Vincent Allen see why why
it's not telling me these things
Johnny says I've heard some people love
the Ulta brand mascara off to try it
Snape's honey says Jen get the look and
get the light pink uLTA Beauty Blender
it's awesome really interesting um see
creamy mattes by Maybelline okay cool 20
weeks worth is talking guarantee I know
right Tracy says Jen you should hide
your must use everyday products that you
gravitate to where in a box and try to
neglected products for weeks or so
absolutely well this is the thing know
is what I what I do are you sure you
want to do this is why things get
neglected this here is my basket of
things that I need to try that are new
products so this is this it's not even
that there's things that I love that I'm
use all the time as much as like there
are some things that I use all the time
but then there's things that I need to
try for review like this here let me
show ya this right here is my list of
products that I should be using
so things that came in subscription
boxes so I got back to Birchbox May and
I've like I've got the products that
Michelle sent me I've got the pallid
debt Nicole from you Nicole sent me I've
got stuff from my julep box my FC bag
these are all subscription box things
that go back to nee that I haven't tried
yet that I need to try it's all
subscription box stuff that I would need
to do for review and especially with FC
and boxycharm
I have to use them because those are two
videos that I really enjoy doing about
to time I have to do because I sense me
for review but if see I really like to
do as well so like in here I've got like
the elf foundation stick that I bought
I've got the essence I heart color
eyeshadow primer
you know stuff from subscription boxes
that I need to try so it would be a good
idea to put away things that I don't
reach for but I got to figure out that
system and how that's gonna work I'd
figure out that system I don't know
alright um move it now this thing keeps
trying to sleep on you have to figure
that for next chat why it's not like
he's falling asleep on me
all right lipstick queen i reviewed
these these are the frog prince blush
and lipstick love these really really
love these this is a cream blush I have
a full review on these but it's just
beautiful it's beautiful and then the
lipstick it just leaves a nice flush to
the cheeks
it's a beautiful shade it's gorgeous
and then this is the lipstick so it
changes with your pH or your pH roots of
the heat's whatever something makes it
change when you put on is probably the
heat of your body but they're very
subtle they're very nice they're very
natural really liked them a lot but I
haven't been using them since I did the
review but I love them I'm doing their
fantastic beauty haul iPhone one Beth
says mug romance make a peak romance
spellbound and infatuation blushes are
beautiful marina says oh my goodness the
Hello Sailor lipstick is horrible that's
good to know they were expensive there
are 20 bucks apiece the lipstick the
lipstick queen stuff $25 each yeah
exactly
super Keisha says is super underrated
makeup brand is the body shop really a
lot of people don't even know they have
makeup I didn't know they had makeup but
I never went by it because oh no just
didn't look good so Sabrina says oh my
goodness so organized I have to be where
I look I'm trying to figure out how did
you organize I haven't organized my like
because then I end up like the last if
see video where I had a nail polish that
I didn't try and it's like what's the
point of reviewing something if I didn't
need to try it I've had it for a month
but haven't you try it I need to make
sure that I review it so Olivia says I
love the Frog Prince you just thought
the gloss I returned the walls I didn't
like the Frog Prince floss it was yucky
it had the green undertone it never went
away and big green sparkles look alright
speaking of lip products let's go into
little parts that I neglect lipstick in
general I have been neglecting because
I've been really into liquid lipsticks
lately my favorite liquid lipsticks
right now are the julep which I got for
that sponsor video really love that
formula even though it was a sponsor
video they're not sponsoring this video
they just sponsored that video but I
really love the julep one that I just
got I really love Oprah and I really
love the new
genuine ones I'm supposed to be getting
a bunch of the genuine stuff with epsy
points when I get my MC van and I went
into a whole review of all of the gem
you'd stop from bare minerals and bare
minerals which in general is a brand
that doesn't get talked about nearly
enough nearly enough but oh my goodness
loving those I love the whipped formulas
for liquid lipsticks they just they last
a really long time they don't feel super
dry I can pop a lip balm over at my lips
start getting dry but it's like you
can't have kiss proof this is the thing
you can't have a kiss proof liquid
lipstick and not be dry because what
makes it kiss proof is it it's not tight
it's not hydrating like if you have
product on its gonna kiss off you know
what I don't feel like you can have both
he's got to be one or the other you know
either you wanted to be kiss proof and
there will be dry or if you want
something that's hydrating and it's not
kiss proof so but the lasting power on
these things it's really really good
so regular lipsticks have just been
neglecting in general um just neglecting
in general so my favorite lipstick
formula of all time is that you faced
lipsticks mo love love this formula I
have this many and I love them but I
never use them anymore
because I've been into the liquid
lipsticks so pink chocolate is my
favorite it's my absolute favorite I
also have unicorn tears which has been
quite a joke in the community for a very
long time I'll show you unicorn tears
myth yeah if you don't know anything
about two faiths unicorn tears I have a
video on it it's crazy it's crazy
actually I'll put this on and I'll put
unicorn tears over top of it but this is
pink chocolate oh my gosh pink chocolate
is like my dream color I love this color
it's fantastic and then I'll put unicorn
tears that were talking about just for
fun unicorn tears I don't know if it was
meant to be used alone but I would never
wear it alone it's too crazy it's
actually got on products on the top of
it because I did not clean it off last
time I used it must have used it with a
purple lipstick because
think I did when I did that crazy purple
look for what's the make up not that
long ago so this is unicorn tears by
itself this is unicorn tears overtop of
pink chocolate it's really fun it's fun
Alexis I know right
she's just said uh unicorn tears with
happy faces unicorn tears is very loved
and then what's up in makeup community
we have fun with your kids it's just fun
to play with it's fun to play with but I
really like this formula I love this
formula I don't use it nearly nearly
enough I just saw somebody said that
what awaits you fast that Palladio is an
underrated makeup brands I've known
anything about Claudia so I'm pretty
sure that they're sold at selling beauty
I think that's where they're sold around
me Olivia says I have unicorn tears but
I don't reach for it often would never
wear alone people would think I was
crazy
yes I'm with you Olivia we're on the
same same thing here
shann says she's never tried unicorn
tears it's fun if you ever see it in a
store definitely swatch it have some fun
with it it's fun Jennifer says I have
clueless and I use it let you use
uniform tears clueless witch clueless I
clueless and colored oh I don't know
clueless what brand is that Steph says I
need you a skinny dip I've heard great
things about you a skinny dip I'll have
to check that out yes I want to check
out some reviews of it um oh okay
so lipstick back to lipstick my
Charlotte Tilbury lipstick when I got
this I was obsessed obsessed when I got
it
I haven't even I haven't touched it in
months so pretty so pretty this one is
in the shade Hepburn honey smells really
really good just like candy not candy
like frosting cupcakes Austin I love it
I love the way it feels my lips feels
amazing another one was my Marc Jacobs
lipstick I can't get stupid amount of
money for these things
stupid stupid amount of money like when
I say stupid I mean like like what was
the weirdest things really expensive
really expensive so I should be using
them you know I don't
but I'm happy to have them because if I
ever want that they were there for me
they're there something and I down this
you the appeal of high-end lipstick of
leather really expensive lipsticks
because there is something special I
feel like we might Charlotte Tilbury
lipstick I feel like there's something
special about the way that it feels in
the lips the way that it goes on so I
can totally understand the appeal of
buying these super super expensive
lipsticks I probably won't buy it many
more because I trouble buying them but I
can see the appeal
Talisa video um you know super super
super expensive a lot of other things I
haven't seen as much of appeal
especially mascara but lipstick I really
like expensive lipstick I do Yesenia
says my bite lipstick is show my
favorite
oh you thing yeah you know the ones we
made together Yesenia and I went to the
bite Beauty lab together and we made
lipsticks together I love that one too I
love the ones I made too that was one of
the best like mega purchases I've ever
made was going to the bike you live with
you Sonya making lipsticks with her it
was really really funny saying you play
us on YouTube another shade I've been
neglecting recently is such a spice by
Maybelline this if your apartment
community this is another big joke of
the community is whatever I don't know
what lipstick to wear I put on touch of
spice and it works but I've been
neglecting it lately I'm really need to
use touch of spice Mort I just price a
super fat and love touch of spice love
it two more things two more things for
you and then we have ten minutes to just
hang out and talk basta Barbara Dahl
says the essence is great I love essence
mascaras love them
Terry Lena Fein thrifty check out her
YouTube channel I like the Jordana
eyebrow gel I've never tried that that's
very interesting to have this ChaCha's
follows that Linda says what do you
think of color pop products I'm obsessed
with their eyeshadows and gel eyeliner I
want to be obsessed with them I want to
love them but I don't I don't and I I
just find the eyeshadows difficult to
work with I know there's tricks there's
different ways to do with it you may
apply them with your fingers things like
that but too much works for me and I
think that it's one of those things
where you have to practice at least I
feel like
I have to practice the colour-pop in
order to learn how to use them better I
don't want to I don't feel like it I've
got so much other stuff that's easy news
car cops not easy for me so I don't I
don't use a much and now the lick the
pot eyeliners I do like the formula but
I got to get a little brush and I got a
put on I got the eyeliners you just the
loom and it's done so I don't reach form
that often even though I do like the
color pop eyeliners the pot eyeliners I
do like over I know that Jean Elise do
you release I'm gonna say I think I got
that right daringly nude is a dupe for
honey love buying that I do have
daringly dude but I'm not positive
Huertas I'm not gonna go search for it
Diane says I like color purple eyeshadow
it's good for pops in the lipid
otherwise not so much yeah see that's
kind of where I'm at - ladybug says
colour-pop lippie stix or some of my
favorite and they wear away so nicely
than that ones I like the Clark hop and
the lippie stix as well I do I do like
those I tend to gravitate more toward
colourpop lip products than anything
else I also really like their blushes
and highlighters I like those better
than the eyeshadows the stats I should
just did a look with color pop
eyeshadows yesterday that's awesome
Christina says Christine says color pop
is behind me is too high-maintenance
yeah much alright so another product
that I have been collectin Revlon just
bitten kissable balm stains I was
obsessed with these forever forever and
I haven't been using them like at all
for years they've just been sitting in
my like it's literally been probably a
year since I've used one of these maybe
not years since I've used one but I'd
maybe use one in like a year and I love
these things I don't know why I don't
ever even know if they still sell Me's I
think they do but I wouldn't buy any
more because I never use them but I'm
not really loving these he had a color
honey and Nina says the color honey the
color honey's fantastic for my skin tone
I love it
Jenna says the makeup revolution blush
and mute I have not tried that one Jill
says I love essence I just made my first
makeup revolutional purchase and I was
hoping it would arrive this weekend
makeup revolution has been hit or miss
for me the eyeshadow palettes has
definitely been hitting us more on the
Miss side which I was sad because I
heard so many great things about
for evolution and I was a little
underwhelmed mm-hmm okay so it says
honey's my go-to lipstick so naturally
pretty yes yes
Boston Barbarossa's face from Ulta brand
I've just started getting these from
Ulta brands so let me show you the
foundation I got this will be in a video
later but you know since we're chatting
in you're here and it's 53 minutes into
the video let me get it or go wrong so
good it's so good and I'm shocked how
much I love it
and it should be right here here it is
the Ulta Demi matte foundation right
here I got it on a whim I was like this
stuff is not going to be good it's not
gonna be good it's good it's really good
I have to pump some out so you can see
the consistency of it because it's
really thick I talked about in the
what's on my face video it's the
foundation I'm wearing on whatsapp and
makeup today I talked about on the
what's on my face video it's on what's
up in makeup calm look how thick this is
super super super thick really thick
when it blends out really nicely it's a
nice medium coverage I don't know if it
would get to fool I haven't tried but
it's a nice medium coverage foundation
and it feels good it looks good it's got
a nice finish shot sure how much I liked
it really pretty nice really really much
so yes and also shocked by that elf one
that I got recently oh my gosh this one
right here this foundation stick
moisturizing foundations thick that I
got before got from Emily Noel 83 oh my
gosh
amazing amazing it's kind of barely the
other one this one looks shiny shiny
shiny look at it accentuating as the
back of my hand oh my goodness but it
blends in nicely again another medium
coverage we go this one's got kind of a
pinky undertone to it this one is in the
shade natural yeah both of those have
been huge winds burning I can't wait to
do my favorites for this month my August
favorites there's gonna be so many
things like this
we bad things and so many good things
all the same time like I don't know I'm
gonna pick because I got so much stuff
to share with you guys a lot of stuff
cat says Tilbury and Kevin upon are the
best liners in my opinion and you know
what I've never tried to you one of
their liners ever Cheyenne says the
Sephora Minnie Mouse palette is
surprisingly good well that's cool I
think they're really good things about
that collection just in general like see
Julie says the foundations think my ELF
is on clearance on their site right now
which I'm like I can't believe that like
why are they doing that I just
discovered it you can't do that to me
you cannot you said you says Jen you
have to review the dose of colors liquid
lipsticks I was floored by the formula
oh don't tell me that you send you their
expensive let me tell me that I was
gonna do the bomb challenge the
black-owned beauty brands challenge
girlfriend I'm like looking at my cart
like I've got like $150 like between
everything trying to get everything done
fifty dollars to do that challenge some
is not cheap like when you're going
indie brands are really expensive like I
was on the only thing was the dubious
place I shadow palettes are on sale so
that was saving me some but still that's
like 25 bucks 25 30 dollars and then the
UM where was I cupcake cupcake something
was it baked bakery Beauty bakery what
twenty dollars for a liquid which is
typical for a more expensive liquid
lipstick but it adds up really quickly
when you get a full face of that stuff
so I'm thinking about doing a dollar
tree challenge instead even though I
really wanted to do with the bottom
challenge the black home beauty brands
black-owned makeup brands challenge I
really want to do that but it's just not
in the budget right now like I've spent
so much money recently on makeup and
just step back from that really long
road trip and it's just I think about
spending $150 on makeup right now it
just doesn't seem like a smart thing to
do for me right now
so me and my do the dollar tree
challenge instead cuz that one looks
like fun and only cost me like ten
dollars
I just bought a bit older to what the
oldest sale I just got 100 bucks the
oldest sale so I might be the black on
beauty brands challenge like once I
get a little more cash flow yeah too
expensive as indie brands man all indie
brands are expensive at least that I've
seen the most part from this part not
all of them but a lot of the indie
brands are expensive honey bunny says
Dollar Tree yes I think it would be fun
I need a doctor's challenge I'd rather
do that and the kids only make up gram
because if you find something good at
the Dollar Tree look if I find something
good people could buy it and actually
use it I don't think you're gonna find
anything good the kids make a challenge
you know Diana says $150 is a week so
groceries I know right and like for one
video and I'm not gonna get enough views
to pay for it either like some some
videos I'll get enough views to pay for
the product like my Jeff first our video
I got enough views that the money that I
got from YouTube from the ad revenue
paid for the palate but that's rare that
that happens and there's no way I'm
gonna make $150 off of a video not at
this point in my youtube career so you
know an hour one day I'd really like to
do it though because I want to support
lakum beauty brands I might get the
dubious cow judy has plays talent anyway
just because I want to try it at first
really good so now you Sonia going back
to your settings and he was saying I
need to try things from those two colors
and there's some specs I want to I want
to Sabrina says does anyone have a hard
time finding the right foundation chase
for their face with all the crazy funky
named if they're the store and swatch
Sabrina there's a link on the where to
buy page to a new app that we talked
about in the show I don't know anything
about it but my friend a call from yang
Nicole she knows the person that made
the brand but you get this like card in
the mail and he horde ups your face then
they match your foundation and then they
give you a list of all the foundation
structure like high and pressure high
into it match your skin tone based on
that color analysis something super cool
so check that out and what's up in
makeup calm there's a link to getting
the car that thing for a dollar and
thirty cents something like that or
something I forget but might be a good
tool and then there was another ones
habit I can't remember what it is but we
talked about I think was last week where
about foundation matching if they
actually I downloaded it I can tell you
what it is because I downloaded it hold
on a second
the one who's in the show I I downloaded
it it's called no that's not it
match Co match Co but this is only for
their foundation the other one that's in
the show today is for all kinds of
foundations show this one you scan a
piece of paper and then you hold it up
to your face and it color matches you
when they send you a foundation but I
think it's like fifty dollars for the
foundation where the other one it
matches you with drugstore brands yeah
model model Co and their model clothes
makeup brands keep real campuses try
glambot for to buy products yeah I've
heard good things about that skin IQ
from Sephora does not work you know
Gentiles I have had that's gee nelisa
Gentiles Gentiles I had that same
problem with the color matching at
Sephora where just didn't seem to work
well I don't know if it was the lighting
in the store if the person didn't do it
they were how they were supposed to go
but it didn't work for me either I ended
up getting like some weird no no it
didn't work didn't work I did it for
like samples and it didn't work the
pancake says Vicki - their foundation
hurts my soul I know but the thing is
foundation can last you a good while and
if you get one that's really good I can
see the justification for fifty dollars
foundation I don't know I can see it
there there there there are a couple of
things that I would spend some money on
foundation is one lipstick is another
one try to think of it as anything else
I probably about it
I think I'd spend that much from blush I
don't know I have though I don't know I
can't judge I can't judge anybody it
spends it I just can't
Stephanie says she'll drop a pretty
penny on foundation for sure yeah
absolutely and Diana says the lighting
Sephora is meant to promote products not
colored magic clients it's a sales
tactic on Kandra says cara cara says i
did the bomb challenge considered Joss
the eyeshadows blush highlighters and
mascara still expensive though Jennifer
says skincare take my money
I'm telling you I know I know I did that
sponsor video
so people may not believe me but all
I've used now is published to myself I
love the polished joy stuff it's not
that expensive and a lot of times you
can search for coupon codes like there's
videos that they sponsor videos and then
the person has a coupon code so you
search on youtube for like the most
recent polish choice video and then
there's a coupon code under them that's
how I'm gonna buy it from now on so
because I'm definitely a big knife for
everyone on this stuff they sent me
