make-up chat my head is getting cut off
let's pull that up just a little bit
there we go
I am my friends welcome to the makeup
chat if you've never been here before my
name is Jen and we're gonna chat today
and I thought it would be really fun to
do would be to revisit some old YouTube
makeup tags if you don't know back maybe
three four five years ago makeup tags
were all the rage all the big youtubers
did them the last big one that I saw was
the writer dye type by Jacqueline helm
which was what about six months ago
something like that but people do tags
as much anymore I feel like everybody's
kind of in their own zone you know and
and there isn't a whole lot of like
collective on YouTube anymore except for
the people that live near each other
that can collaborate with each other
which is awesome but for people they
don't live near a bunch of other
youtubers the tags are really really
nice so I tagged everybody if you have a
youtube channel and you'd like to
reinvent these tags you'd like to do
them again then feel free to do them I
think there are a lot of fun I think
also there might have been a little bit
of drop and interest in them I think
people started getting kind of tired
among because they started getting a
little stale um but I do think they're
fun and I think you didn't get a lot of
good information out of them so today
we're going to be doing two tags and I
have a backup in case we have extra time
so the first one is their this or that
tag and basically what it is is we go
through this where that so choose this
or that it's just a way to kind of get
to know me better for me to get to know
you better so you can feel free to leave
your answers in the comments down below
or if you hear in the live chat you can
put in a lot chat I'm gonna go over and
look to and talk to you all about what
your ideas are if you're in the
collective brain of awesome can make of
Awesomeness this morning we'll see what
your answers are to this and then the
second one is the seven deadly sins in
community tag and if you know the seven
deadly sins its greed wrath gluttony
sloth pride lust and envy and there's a
question that goes with each one related
to makeup one of them is not makeup
related which is kind of
but I think we're gonna change to make
the per baby because kind of an odd
question but we'll get there we'll get
there so before we do I am going to go
ahead and take a quick break from
talking directly at you and say hi to
the collective brain of makeup
awesomeness I welcome them into my home
so I would like to be polite and say
hello to them and I'm so happy that they
take it to them out of their morning to
spend with me so I am going to go over
there right now and see what we've done
so we have a man's uh good morning she's
the first one in here christina is here
so she's hope there's no problem with
the webmaster today it's our first time
here so happy to have you there
Christina Elizabeth is here first time
in live chat for her as well I'm just
gonna call you
Keller Keller good morning to you Kyla
good morning amber is here and cagey
Tabitha are fabulous production manager
is here she's talking about the little
Easter Egg I put at the end of what to
can make up the new show today it may be
a little easter egg at the very end so
watch the end he'll you'll find my
little Easter egg I left for you it's a
gem good morning - Nadine thank you for
helping this week being a what's up in
makeup Facebook hunter this week I
appreciate it lots people joining me
what's it makeup hunter group on
Facebook that is a no chatter group just
to let you know if you want to chat
about makeup Facebook or do you want to
join is what's up in makeup that's where
we have all our discussions about
everything coming out then what's the
makeup hunters is just simply a place to
report and to show things that are
coming out the reason why is because it
keeps our admin work to nothing
basically and that except for deleting
comments on anything that there's no
discussion there can't be any conflict
and if there's no conflict we don't have
to moderate so we have enough moderation
going on on what's it been makeup that
we're trying to keep the hunters
conversation free so he and oh and the
other reason is if it doesn't help it so
it doesn't buck the post so that I can
keep track of who has submitted Sunday
for that week because all their names
are scrolling at the end of the show
which is super super cool so those are
the two Facebook groups what's up in
makeup is the one for chatter and
hunters is the ones who submit things
feel sure to have your names going at
the end in case there was any needing to
be any clarification on that
all right let's keep saying hi so Thank
You Nadine for being my hunter this week
Heather and Latina and Julio in the
house Melissa and Julian Laurie one of
our wonderful reporters check out her
YouTube channel at Florence parks liz
claman is here at erin and banshee news
and aspen and Karen and Lauren and eats
your soul and amber and reading lots of
my favorite favorite favorite favorite
people so thank you so much for being
here let's go ahead and get into this
yes so I've got all the questions right
here I'm gonna go down so that I can see
what everybody's saying looking at
myself you guys have to tell me off but
something's going on with the camera go
okay
maybe trying to post the link to the
website make a group in YouTube won't
let me yeah it won't
it's the everybody it doesn't let you
post links which is lame
okay so if you do apply to the Facebook
group and you can't get accepted make
sure that you are answering the three
questions if you don't answer the three
questions they're very easy to answer if
you can't if you're not getting in that
monkey why is you're not answering the
questions correctly if you are which
they're not they're not hard to answer
they're they're pretty easy to answer if
you have any questions you can always
email me or you send me a message nwu I
am on Facebook and I can try to help you
with it or if you're a how much private
sometimes it's hard for us to tell the
churro we approach them and try to make
sure that you don't get any spammers in
there so Shelby says congrats on ten
million views oh my gosh I have to go
off-topic one more time before we do the
thing I have the bags I'm going to show
you this is all for giveaway so I've got
this bag full of giveaway and I got this
bag almost all the way pull it's
probably about 7/8 of the way fold we've
give away stuff so there's gonna be five
winners of the giveaway it's gonna be
this week watch out for the notification
I'll show you a couple of things got a
cute little Luxy brush set we've got
some urban decay
infused complex prep spray the b61 and
we've got don't tell I'm naked heat
pallet so that's some of the goodies
that are in here just to give you a
little sneak peek
and again the 25 wonders it's gonna be
there a very unique giveaway so
definitely stay tuned for that this week
all right so let's go ahead and go into
the tag so though this is that tag it
first starts with makeup so the first
question is blush or bronzer and I am
definitely a blush person bronzer kind
of confuses me but I can use it I can
kind of figure it out but like the whole
cons working with the bronzer look here
looks really nude look I feel like it's
because my face shape is kind of oval
ish and I don't need a lot of correction
you know like when people say that
they're gonna correct you know it's
people with like really narrow faces
really oval faces things like that I
don't feel like I need that as much as
maybe some face shapes and I'm trying to
like reference Wayne goth here when he
talks about correct it's not that
there's anything wrong with you it's
just that you know when people do makeup
and they want to create certain face
shapes that's what they call it they
call it correct and you know there's
nothing wrong with you it's just the
term that people use but anyway so I
don't really
it always looks weird on me whenever I
try to do and so I just I do blush a
love blush Felicia says blush and
Christine says blush lots of blush
people on Meghan says bronzer I wear
blush and bronzer every day though I
just don't get excited about blush there
you go that's awesome Sandra loves
bronzer Katie says I would have to pick
bronze or some days I just can't when
bronzes get flush all together Wow
yeah I've never done that I think that
these bronze are ass blush before I've
done that amanda says bronzer and the
summer blush the rest of the year
Jenna says bronzer a Georgia says blush
alright let's go to the next one next
one is lip gloss or lipstick definitely
lip stick I am NOT a big lip gloss
person I'm starting to get more
into the lipgloss now that the shiny
lips are coming back I'm getting more
than lip gloss and also because the
liquid lipsticks are they're drying some
of them and I can't take it the way it
feels
I hate the especially if it gets sticky
I'm trying out a bunch of drugstore
liquid lipsticks right now and when my
lips go and with the skin sticks
together and they I find if I put like
not an oil-based lip gloss but I like a
creamy lip gloss over top it'll get rid
of some of that stick but that's really
mmm I'm a big lipstick person I like the
opacity of it also let the lasting power
of a lipstick usually a lot longer and
overwhelmingly everybody chatting
lipstick Barbara Nadine no reason at all
a meal ooh-hoo
Devin says lip gloss Shelby says
lipstick Sandra and Billy Billy says
both Joanna says lipstick all the way
yeah Beth says lipstick Harris's lip
gloss ain't poppin when you've got your
hair flying into your face that is a
good point Tara it's good very very good
point
Felicia says it depends on the brand
that's a good point
as well all right let's go to eyeliner
or mascara that's really hard because I
feel like both are necessary well if I
had to choose I would probably choose
mascara just because I feel like I can
wear it looks without eyeliner but I
don't feel like I can I can personally
wear looks without mascara because my
lashes are non-existent like they
literally go to like go to here like
there's so nothing and you can't see
them and you cannot see my lashes
without mascara at all
my son has gorgeous gorgeous my
six-year-old Thor just lashes I'm so
jealous I wanted like my daughter does
too I start oh I get it I didn't get
that gene everybody's saying my sparrow
oh here we go we've got some out loud
they're going really fast okay so let's
stop the stop the crazy string okay
Georgia says mascara Dina Dina says
mascara
Charlotte Charlotte says mascara caramel
butterfly says pass on both Jamie
mascara Melissa
Scarah Tabitha which mom Davis Tabitha
says mascara
oh it's gif down Kyla says mascara Devyn
muster I don't really wear eyeliner
Heidi says liner Maria eyeliner and
mascara complement each other I
completely agreed Nancy says both and
Tish crew says mascara blonde lashes I
skip eyeliner most of the time I really
like an eyeliner though especially a pen
liner minors but if I had to pick I
would pick mascara all right next up
foundation or concealer hmm probably BB
cream underneath you got a probably BB
cream because I feel like BB cream is
like I know I like a more light to
medium coverage on my face because I
don't have a lot of discoloration or
blemishes and things like that so I like
many creams but I don't think when this
side was graded that me be queens were
thing in the United States I think they
were still hanging out with Korea I
don't think we caught on yet but yeah so
I would say BB cream but I did just do
my friend Debbie's makeup and I just put
concealer on her she doesn't want
foundation and it looked really good on
her just a little bit of concealer just
the kind of spot for are things that
look great on her looks wonderful Misha
says concealer and tabatha says Scott of
which mom Davis says foundation dana
says concealer I can do without
foundation Samantha BB cream for me too
Felicia concealer Debbie love the dr.
jart beauty balm the only time I've used
the dr. drop beauty balm I turned gray
on me again Amy looked like I did not
have life in my body like I don't know
what happened maybe I got a bad parents
that shape tape can do it all gold in
the South concealer I can makeup
foundation in the powder that's true
there you go for it says both Megan says
foundation oh no I lost it I lost Megan
but you said foundation Alicia says
foundation tan foundation because I have
every problem you can think of Jamie I
can always use foundation as a concealer
well there you go
so you find a foundation to be able to
be enough coverage for what's going on
Billy says CC cream and just says BB CC
and
like coverage and Mimi says it cosmetics
CC powder is so good I just try to
yesterday it is good I do like that one
I do I like it over top of a BB cream I
don't really like it as much on its own
them alright let's move on to neutral or
color eyeshadow I had to pick I'd go
color when this job came out I would
have said neutral but now I'm gonna say
color because I've really really been
loving the colors lately you know and
and I think that it's just because I got
bored with the neutrals and look if you
feel that way or not but I got bored
with the neutrals I was kind of tired of
it except for the neutrals with some
sparkling glitter and shine one thing
I'm really appreciating lately with the
level of shine it's coming out in a lot
of the eyeshadow palettes it seems like
that even though my eyes have a little
bit of texture on them the the shiny
isn't accentuating the texture like it
seems to and some of my older College
there it's like whoa holy moly crepe
city you know and I'm even have that
crepey eyelids but I felt like it really
accentuated reflects and how it's
recently what the foiled formulas are
really not accentuating my fine lines
much at all
Gabrielle sang color amber color Dana
says net neutral I'm a plain Jane
nothing wrong with that florid color
Alysia color Tina bow
tabatha color love so color Oh color or
glitter my Shauna says color but you
need transition color absolutely totally
agree aura depends on what I've got
planned for the day yeah I totally agree
I like today I'm trying not gonna wear
up a lot of color Chan says I need my
neutral max in my color looks yeah
absolutely totally agree I think they're
talking about like with you know overall
you know whether you use what color
nemesis is neutral the pops of color yes
there you go
Beth neutral sherry says neutrals Dorina
says mutual is better for more mature
women like me you know I think it just
depends on your personal style you know
I think that if you are a more mature
woman then you can totally rock color it
just depends on I mean you don't want to
go out full meaning you know with the
blue not meaning here
but me me you know with the blue and all
of that you know with it being super
loud unless that's your style which I'm
not judging but I think that more mature
women can definitely rocks in color
especially like purples I feel like
anybody can rock purples as long as it
doesn't turn the break is a fun a lot of
purple eyeshadows will think the great
just super super annoying I'm I'm happy
to see some greens coming into eyeshadow
because I thought greens can look really
beautiful on a lot of people but
Purple's I think is a great way to dip
into color if you're not used to using
colors
let's do next one pressed or loose
eyeshadows I prefer pressed mousse are
messy but I will use a loose eyeshadow
there especially if it's worth it like
the makeup geek the duochrome shadows
the loose ones I will I will use on the
shadow also there's a brand Club glamour
doll the glamour doll eyes that has
really really good blue shadows and then
heat Sheik is another Emmy brand new I
really love it makes really great loose
shadows that are really unique I feel
like those into any brands with their
loose shadows really have some unique
colors so that's my exception to the
rule other than that
I'm definitely a press kind of person
okay chats going crazy let's stop it
boom Monica pressed Shauna pressed
Katherine or cream I'm not as big of a
queen for since I find the cream tends
to crease on the huge cream as a base
and then put things over top of it but a
lot of creams crease on me some reason
Dina says pressed Natalie press Felicia
why are people calling me while Chad is
going on they should know better
Alysia pressed Halle pressed although
loose look beautiful Christie good
morning Christine daddy loves sugar pill
loose powders that's cool that's good to
know I don't own any of those but if
they're loose I press them in the pans
myself which is very smart
Jennifer press but then the loosen it
pigments are beautiful Mimi says love
the mug shimmers loose yes Nadine I got
two of those loose pigments from the wet
bog unicorn collection I never use them
because they're so messy I just ordered
a bunch of loot
I just ordered a bunch of stuff from
wet-and-wild last night because I
wanting to try some of the catsuit
liquid lipsticks so I thought some of
the uniform stuff too along with it then
I'll be moving along with my other
liquid lipsticks that I got my drugstore
liquid lipsticks working on that video
that comes to fruition because I keep
saying I'm working on this video working
on that video and then they never happen
like my mic with the ordinary video I
still need to get that one out it's not
gonna be next week either but the
subculture palette would be actually
that one I'm determined we're doing a
giveaway video next week and subcortical
it that's my focus for next week alright
anyway moving on brushes or sponges if I
had to pick on go brushes and I'll tell
you why because my sink is a whole 9
feet out the door I don't go back my
spine how dumb is that how lazy my but I
don't want to take my beauty sponge and
walk 9 feet out the door to the bathroom
to wet it that's the only reason why I
would say I would say brushes are
desponding you don't need the weapon
Laura pimentos Lola lens here she says
she loves the Wildcat suits awesome I'm
really looking forward to trying those
I've heard wonderful things let's see
Elizabeth says brushes and ginger says
brushes Mimi says Feather River body
pressed aw amazing I saw you left a
comment about that this morning me about
the Feather River body I've never heard
of Feather River body until this week so
I'm gonna have to look into it because
Mimi vouches for it so if maybe I'll
just wear it it must be awesome her
Steven says brushes amy brushes
Laura from mrs. Lowell incest brushes
but that Beauty Blender has my heart I
know I know if I'm not being lazy
I like the beauty blender - I like the
older brand one Sarah says jag keep a
small spray bottle with distilled water
my babies quits my sponge which is smart
it's smart I should do the same thing
Julie says just recently got into the
new look so I really don't know what's
worth buying I'll probably have no more
than I do you go join what's it that
make up the Facebook group I have so
many questions but then like 10-minute
Drive answer any question that you want
Steph says sponge for foundation and can
see
and setting with powder man you are
complicated staff Devin says OMG i love
Feather River body well there you go
learning all kinds of new things today
Pamela says Jed dance sponges with
setting spray is that enough though is
that enough dampness does it pop up when
you just do setting spray on it
I don't imagine it would still be like
compact I don't know okay I'll try it
you guys know a lot of lot of times
people here go way more than I do
all right we got you Donna Marty 20
minutes in holy moly all right we're
gonna sit through the nails one more
click but feel free to answer them in
the comments or in the chat nails OPI or
China Glaze neither I would say julep is
my favorite you know I'm about to cancel
my subscription because that if I had to
pick the queen of a pan trying to play
that probably pick China Glaze
long or short in the middle my nails for
my nails this length like not super long
but not super short i if I had to pick
longer short I'd probably pick short
does it belong with the real long nails
like Stephanie Nicole I should say she
can't like do this because she pokes
herself in their nose like she just yeah
that's too much for me I can't even
acrylic or natural definitely natural
rights or darts it kind of depends on
the season I do brights in the summer
and darks in the winter but I did black
couple weeks ago so you know I did flack
with some um since silver glitter
because of the blacks that beach we saw
in Iceland flower or no flower I don't
know exactly what that means well and it
was flower a trend putting flowers on
your nails maybe will say design or no
design I still love my nail stamping I
still do that my borne fruit store
plates are still well in use I love
those so it really depends on whether a
time or not if I have time I put designs
on all right we're gonna zip through the
body one two and then we'll spend a
little more time in fashion we've got
body fashion hair and random so I'm
gonna zip through the body perfume or
body splash perfume definitely body
splash is not really my thing I don't
find it last at all
on my skin it lasts for like 10 minutes
and then it goes away
I don't know but perfume scent tends to
last longer so I'd say perfume lotion or
body butter or whatever I happened to
grab if I had to pick one I'd pick
lotion cuz I don't have super hydration
issues said probably pick lotion body
wash or soap body wash I try to use soap
but soap annoys me and that I have to
like get the suds like I've trouble
getting the suds going with with a bar
soap so I'm really a pump body wash kind
of person so I can put it in a pink fin
it's just faster for me lush or other
bath company whatever is cheaper so
probably not lush I'm not really any
bath products as much my kids love bath
bombs thanks to my friend Nancy who sent
the kids a bunch of bath bombs now
they're obsessed so I watched them do
bath bombs and things but I take showers
and I want them be over as quickly as
possible
but I am NOT a shower and joy or I just
want to get in I'm gonna do what I got
to do and I want to get out like I just
I don't care oh who is that just said
body oil well there you go
I do like lush I just feel like it's
very expensive and the stuff goes way
too fast for it to be worth it to me
especially like you know bath bombs and
things we spend 6 bucks on a bath bomb
and it's gone in like 15 seconds or 30
seconds they're fun them they are fun
but they're expensive
alright let's talk about fashion which
is something that I am NOT great at my
friend Zeva says she's gonna take me
shopping not take me shopping but she's
gonna go with your shopping and we pick
out some clothes for fall because I'm
not good at fashion I need someone to
help Laura says lush is there a price
winning pretty winning mama says I use
dr. teals bubble back alright
so jeans or sweatpants jeans on the
jeans person I love jeans if I had to
choose jeans or shorts I will wear jeans
all summer long I don't like wearing
shorts I don't enjoy it I don't I don't
like
leg showing I feel like naked one of my
legs are showing I don't know what it is
my husband makes funny all the time only
95 degrees out and I'll have my jeans on
I don't want shorts and ironically I'm
wearing shorts right now because all my
dreams are dead you may be watching but
jeans or sweatpants definitely jeans
I don't wear sweatpants out of the house
I wear sweatpants to sleep like for
sleeping all weird sweatpants look
absolutely like I love my sweat mrs.
Smith but not to wear it out I don't
judge anybody that does but that's just
not my thing
long sleeve or short sleeve what's it
called hold shoulder both I like a good
cold shoulder of course this was done
four years ago so cold shoulder wasn't a
thing but I love my cold shoulder tops
and my off the shoulder tops I love that
what do we got going on here no reason
all says I don't like Jamie's not coffee
at the first skirts and dresses yeah and
I just I don't feel comfortable I don't
know what it is
why I don't feel comfortable I love my
two Mastiffs says I'm so the same I love
my jeans even in the summer
sweatpants are for bedtime for me that's
why I feel ginger says both sleeves lol
yeah both suits and the season two I
think that's kind of weird when dresses
or skirts if I had to pick up definitely
pick dresses because I can't coordinate
skirts I don't know how it matches curly
the top I have skirts
don't wear any of them because I don't
know what shirt goes good with them
dresses are so much easier it's already
match for you after work stripes are
plaid neither not wear either but I had
a pig I guess some kind of stripes
against their not really in distress
work but Kristen says a maxi skirt comes
in handy in the hot summer yes and you
know I have maxi dresses they don't have
maxi skirts there's a nice split in the
group between skirts and dresses
flip-flops or sandals I have to wear
sandals because I have a busted right
foot
if you don't know this about me I have a
crack in my second metatarsal that is
still healing it's been almost three
years since I busted it at Generation
greedy by wearing booties two
generations including years ago and its
lies until completely so I cannot wear
heels anymore and I cannot wear
flip-flops anymore
I have won a pair of flip-flops to the
grocery store once and I regretted it so
I am I have to wear sandals now I've no
choice flat sandals it's very boring oh
by the way as of now I think I told you
guys before in a shot that I was going
to generation beauty and me work as of
now I'm not going I am hoping that I do
get to go I ran and visit it was my
fault
I'll just tell you what it was totally
my fault I assumed that I was going to
be invited to generation Beauty by FC so
I didn't reserve any money for it and I
was hoping to get I thought I was gonna
get invited and I didn't get invited
this time so this I as of now there's
still a chance I still could get invited
because they're still trying to work out
the last invites so if I don't get
another sounds terrible but if they
don't give me the comp ticket it's just
not in my current budget to go to
generation Beauty so I'm not going which
stinks and it's my fault because I
assumed and I should lender soon so
we'll see I mean I was really sad about
it though so I'm I love generation
beauty and I go all the time but you
know I understand that they need to get
to fix other people they can't just look
like the same people every single time
you know they have to give chances to
other people to go do all the events and
all of this and I get it I totally get
it but I'm so sad I'm still allowed to
be sad about it yeah so I mean I don't I
don't
it's okay it's alright I'm good but it's
possible that I could still go because
it did get an email from some from Etsy
that I'm like so he invited so I will
let you know if anything changes if
you're planning going to New York you
know alright let's move on because I'm
solving a whole nother tag left to do as
far as your hats I don't know how to use
a tribe starts up weird on me
I have trouble coordinating the scar so
definitely hats it's much easier studs
are dangly earrings it just depends on
what I'm wearing honestly that meant to
split for me oh no I guess if I had to
pick I would say dangly just because
they're more interesting Canton
prosthetics wants to know what if that's
I'm going to this year or next
definitely plans to go to I'm at to New
York again when that comes back up but
but beyond that I don't know how much oh
no it's okay more she says how much of
the tickets can we help can we help you
I mean I think it's also it's also to
that beyond the money issue of it it's
also that I I wouldn't be able to go to
any of the events so they have that
created a have a cocktail party stuff
and those are kind of my favorite things
like I like Jim Beauty cause you get to
meet like subscribers and things so
that's like one part that's really big
but the other really big part is the
cocktail party and the creator day which
I wouldn't be invited to if I purchased
my tickets and that's a big piece so
without those invites it's almost it's
kind of not worth it it's not even like
as I know degenerate if this ended the
swag bag at the cocktail party but at
this point I mean I'm giving away so
much stuff I don't need the big swag bag
like it's really not about that it's
about going to go hang out with my
friends and you know meeting new people
you know I've met so many awesome people
like those vents and at the main event
you can't believe people with those
people because everybody's kind of off
doing their own thing so it's it's
really the split between the two and I
should have mentioned that earlier but I
didn't want to talk about it too long
but but yeah it's not just about the
money it's about not getting the invites
the other special events too but I do
appreciate you trying to offer to help
that was really nice of you and I try
not to tap into you guys for help with
financial stuff so my husband does make
you know enough money to cover for lots
of things it's just we didn't budget for
it I could push it into the budget if I
really wanted to I could do it but I
don't think that that would be the best
idea you know what I mean so it's it's
more than just the money thing Oh Laura
says we should still hope you go no it's
okay I promise it's okay I don't I don't
it's okay Laura says the networking
nights are before so important yeah and
I
all right let's move on so now we have
necklaces or bracelets necklaces
bracelets I try to wear but they annoy
me because it go back and forth when I
talk and like I'm kind of an expressive
talker and then make it like this and
then flop up and down and so forth so I
don't like that heels are flat I told
you I have to wear flats cowboy boots or
riding boots neither I can't wear it I
guess
I guess we'll probably be riding boots
because it flat jacket or hoodie hoodie
if I can do it I like hoodies how
forever21 are Charlotte Russe neither we
would this need for not for me yeah I
don't I can't go those places I look
weird in those clothes everyone supplies
and got something cute forever 21 but
not very often
Abercrombie or Hollister really now that
we talk about uh you know the limited
person is uh and taller or something I
don't know that was the reason we came
to my mind neither for ever from your
Hollister absolutely neither I can get
something to forever 21 everyone to the
mall but I remember your Hollister no
Saxons Avenue or Nordstrom have you been
into a Saks that Avenue and looked at
the price tags on those things like the
discounted we have look out of discount
Saxon Avenue and like the disappointed
Church like 75 bucks you know and now
even a cute like the ones that I saw
that we discounted the definitely
Nordstrom I'm a huge Nordstrom at fan
love me some Nordstrom Rack love me some
hot look those are my favorites I am
like I grew up without a lot like right
now a financially stable but I grew up
without a lot so it like makes me cringe
is spend more than $30 for a shirt I
love like I can't even I can't even you
know I can technically do it just I
can't I can't do it it's it seems like
too much and I love finding deals you
know I think that that's something gets
in the ring of you is that deal finding
is just so fun and you find something
really cute that was really cheap it
just feels good it feels great hair
curly you're straight
if I had to pick if I'd say curly just
because of the way my hair is now I'm
getting my hair done today buddy
so I'm I'm just getting it coated all
one color because I'm tired of having
you to tome Herod had to to inherit for
like three years
and I'm just done with it I got it done
October three years ago and like what
I'm still teaching and I'm done with it
so I'm gonna just get it done all in one
color
Nancy says Nordstrom and Kohl's sherry
says TJ Maxx and Marshalls yeah Laura
says don't forget to like this video
oh thank you that's so nice of you yeah
I think the wavy are straight just
really have to do with I'm all over the
place it really has to do with your own
personal their whatever is easy asking
I'm so with you on that bun or ponytail
i wish i could say fun I've been doing
that like cute little morality movie on
the top of the head like momma bond
thing whatever should close it but it
hurts my head gives me a headache it
looks cute when you hurt so I didn't
like back here today because it doesn't
hurt me when I do that
alright I gotta sit through these
because I wanted to be other one another
time the other tags really good alright
bobby pins are butterfly clips neither
definitely neither I don't I don't use
either I don't need them I don't use
them I I was better with hair I'd
probably use bobby pins but I don't I
don't know if that stuff I don't do that
a lot of different opinions on the bun
or ponytail looks like it's a nice split
wearing down yep Holly says I like the
video people and do that enough oh my
gosh you guys do it's like it's so
helpful when you hit the like button
like that really makes a difference in
YouTube's algorithm so doesn't matter if
you're watching if you like the video
just hit that little button for the
person you're watching on because it
really does help and we every little bit
and only takes a quick second and not
just for me but for everybody a
hairspray or gel definitely hair spray
gel and I do not get along route go it
all longer short long light or dark both
I am both but we're gonna go dark we're
gonna go dark side sweet bangs or full
bangs
side sweet bangs are so annoying I tried
to do that once failed miserably bow
bends not going to events today though
no bangs for a while up or down I
usually wear my hair down unless it's
hot or unless my hair's dirty right now
my hair just not
and people always comment on here if
don't do it and it's in the video and
it's a mess I get tons of comments and I
just didn't feel like dealing with the
comments of gender your hair before you
like that majesty maybe a bit so we see
if there's anything else going on in the
chat Devon says hair spray medium no
bangs
Shannon says bun gave me a headache at
first too yeah I think it's just because
my hair isn't trained to do that
I didn't we need to do something do your
hair a lot in one way your hair kind of
gets used to going in that direction so
maybe I should be just suck it up and do
it more often all right random ones
rain or shine shine except for tonight
I'll take some rain because I love the
sound of rain when I'm trying to relax
like I'm sitting on my couch and I'm
editing and there's rain falling on the
windows behind me I love that summer or
winter I'm a summer person do not like
the cold I hate the cold it makes me
angry when I'm cold I get all okay just
just don't talk to me when I'm cold I'm
eight being cold fall or spring spring
and the spring person I love the spring
it's my favorite season chocolate or
vanilla well actually you know what I'm
starting to like all a little bit more
because like I'm drinking my pumpkin
spice the Cristen game watches this I'm
drinking my green mountain or whatever
is a Green Mountain pumpkin spice that
she told me to get last year I still
have some using it but I do like some of
the fall stuff I like what things start
to change in the fall but spring when we
come out of winter and we know the
winter is over just makes me so happy
chocolate or vanilla chocolate no doubt
about it chokolate east coast or west
coast East Coast the East Coast girl
forever forever and ever ever
I miss those girl I love the Baltimore
area I grew up in the DC area and I
don't like the DC area for lots of
reasons I find the people to be nicer in
the Baltimore area I like that there's
less traffic in the Baltimore area
I like the harbor the Inner Harbor is
beautiful the police officers are
sometimes not so nice
the worst parts of Baltimore because
they have a lot going on that's a whole
nother issue that I could talk about and
I won't because last time I made a video
about it I got a lot of hate and lots of
unsubscribes my neighbor is a police
officer he's a wonderful wonderful man
and I know he does a fantastic job but
I've met some really mean just like
anything there's people that are good
and bad in everything but the Baltimore
Police Department is the Balmer City
Police Department mean for not being
very kind and not being very fair so
that breaks my heart about Baltimore
where I like the DC police officers that
I've come in contact with better than
some of the Baltimore police officers
I've come in contact with
that's all I don't like about Baltimore
but East Coast all the way Baltimore all
the way has my heart I love this area so
much love it so much so again no heat
against police officers this is a live
chat and speaking off the top of my head
but most police officers are wonderful
people but I've met some really horrible
ones as well just like in any profession
when I was teaching there were good
teachers a bad teacher a same thing all
right so let's move on to tag number two
we've got twenty minutes through tag
number - 22 minutes and this is called
the seven deadly sins of beauty so first
one is greed and the question that goes
with it is what is your most inexpensive
the item and then what is your most
expensive so I picked my favorite
inexpensive beauty item because I have a
lot of things well quite a few things
that are a dollar but this is my
favorite thing that's a dollar this is
the LA color shimmering loose eyeshadow
with brush this is specifically image to
shade sunshine if you've ever come
across this and you are at all attracted
to this I highly recommend picking this
up I do recommend you use at least a
primer if not glitter glue with it or
else it does have fallout but this is
amazing it is let me swatch it for you
because it is on another level when I
met taki for the first part I was
wearing this on my eyes so for my gosh
what is on your eyes and she and I
supporter what was she's okay I was
hoping she'd do a WTF on it but she
didn't all right I just had it some out
35 $1 $1 this is my one of my favorite
bowls so high highly we try to be highly
probably recommend that most expensive
thing that I own was actually a gift
from my friend Nancy she had gotten this
in her you delish lucky bag and she
already owned it so she said she went to
meet us have been Natasha's Nona green
brown eye shadow Kyle I think this is
like a $207
eyeshadow palette people ask me all the
time is it worth it I don't think any
eyeshadow palette will ever be worth two
hundred and some dollars to me ever ever
I don't care how many Ounces how many
grams of product advice I don't care how
amazing it is I don't think I shadow
should ever cost that much that's my
opinion
if you feel different feel free to
different it's okay differences make the
world go round but is it a really good
eyeshadow palette yes absolutely my very
thankful I have it absolutely
what does it worth to what I'm paid to
hundreds of dollars for this and only I
would make 200 a second if it went on my
eyes did it dance and then popped off
and told me I was beautiful I still
wouldn't spend two hundred and some
dollars on eyeshadow palette but I do
like it I would say if you are in the
market for a very expensive eyeshadow I
do recommend all right ray Duff says my
favorite cheapest item would be my old
to charcoal swabs and my favourite in
expect expensive items are my busy art
palettes Michelle says most expensive as
my skincare think I can get really
expensive Christine says I really want
to try busy art I've been enjoying my
visit art Alex very much the 98 cents i
shadow hotpots from Coastal Scents
Monique says absolutely they are very
very good I agree 100%
Amanda Lawrence is here learning my
friends I sent you a picture of my
dinner on on Instagram did you get them
you get my Instagram dinner Amanda we
shake we trade off the trade photos of
our dinners
dear says I think if I dance and
complimenting me I think will be worth
it well maybe I'm just being silly all
right next up we have rap and rap says
what beauty products do you have a
love-hate relationship with all right I
got two first one is the anasazi a dip
brow pomade because I do love this but I
find it very difficult to work with I
mean it goes on so opaque and I don't
really like that look on me I don't like
it to be just like block brows I feel
like it looks really really weird on me
so I have to just be really careful with
it but it lasts all day long it's a
really nice product but I don't I don't
like that I have trouble like getting it
to be exactly what I wanted to be I find
it to be a difficult productivity but I
do love the way it looked what I've done
the second one is the dose of colors
ideal duo's I want to love these but I
don't
I keep trying these and I they're so
beautiful what it is is there's a base
here so it's almost a comeback peat pot
but it's earlier than that Paint Pot and
I think that's where they miss the ball
on it if they need to be more creamy and
less oily and then on the bottom there's
a loose glitter on the bottom so what
ends up happening is because it's not
tacky enough it's not sticky enough it's
not glitter gloomy enough it doesn't the
glitter doesn't stay and it falls
everywhere and it doesn't stay where
it's opposed to at least for me so this
is one it's like please be good just
please be good because you're so
beautiful but you're not good and that
makes me so sad because it just come out
with some limited edition ones and I was
time to divide them and I was like no
Jenn you don't like them don't find um
you don't like that let me see what the
collective brain is saying Steph says my
scaring foundation mascara because now I
have new glasses
and when I ran my scare on my long
lashes hit my glasses every time I blame
oh poor baby your glasses are too long
oh my gosh alright Lee says gimme brow
and NYX micro pencil brow was and um by
a BH yes Holly says Sarah I agree about
the L'Oreal you guys must be talking
about brow pencils
he says I don't have any eyebrow
products I'm not sure what shade would
work I have naturally thin light
eyebrows I think they're giving the
recommendations instead of the dipbrow I
love all those products but this is my
love hate Katie says NARS tinted
moisturizer lasts like an hour and long
regards heat yesterday Oh Lynn says
Maude is Marvin runs that's worth it yes
if you like the colors absolutely
absolutely it's a fabulous palette all
right going on to gluttony what are your
most delicious beauty products okay this
is one that makes no sense to me I don't
get it I talked about it so many times I
mean you're probably really tired of
hearing it but this is the Tarte play
play palette it's one of those things
like if you ever met somebody and people
are like why do you like that person I
don't know why I like them I just like
them and I don't get why you like this
person so much but you can't help it
it's in your soul that you like this
person you don't know why you have this
lip thing that's like I feel like I must
have met the tart play play in a
previous life because there's no reason
why I actually love it as much as I do
it smells like vanilla every time I open
it it smells so good it just makes me
happy in my heart and it worked really
really well and it's definitely like I
think it was also because it caught me
off guard because you don't typically
like try repellents and this one worked
so well
it's so boring though it's so boring why
do I love you I don't doubt it but I'd
say it's delicious because it smells
really good and it just makes me feel
good you know what they just I don't
know why how dumb is that what kind of
dumb palette is this that I love I don't
know
and a lot of people are going to be mad
at me about this one too is the Too
Faced sweet H power unlike the stinky
peach palette I do I think it smells
amazing
I know some people think it's the sneak
distinct you draw anything like this I
like the way it works I like the way it
smells
I think it's different than other things
to bases come out one you know I just I
like this powder and it smells good for
me
family's not going to be happy with me
my friend Kimberly Clark is not going to
be happy
what she doesn't like this thing - peach
pal but I do our other palettes that
just give me the delicious are my
palettes that are like my collecting
palettes the ones that I just oh my god
tennis love it okay so the Alice Through
the Looking Glass palette by urban
ignite oh no I dropped one okay I'll see
the looking glass by Urban Decay this is
another one that I just find delicious
in that just just makes me so happy I
did a tutorial on this and it's one of
my favorite looks like ever created
because it was I feel like it was beyond
my skill level how that thing came out
pick the video I did about that I look
back on and it's like of course it's
limited vision don't lorac Pirates of
the Caribbean palette I love this I love
this I love the blush palette that's in
there it just when I can do something
like lust well I just lost one which one
we do it by Boston paper okay
this one was flattening like I just want
to eat these things yeah and I love them
I lost after them to that blush palette
is amazing you can never find these
especially the blush palette fabulous
and then this one the beauty and the
beast' palette by lorac kind of a boring
shade selection but i want this but
whatever reason they just make me happy
you know April says a BH minor
renaissance how it is gorgeous it makes
me happy yeah absolutely
Taylor says love Alice so different and
fun completely agree I'm waiting for
Urban Decay to come out with something
else like that it's been a while since
the case come out with something like
Nina the vise palettes in the Alice
palette and things like that usually
agrees on all three Lintz as I bought
the Alex and Pirates palettes because
you I hope you love them win because I
love them ginger says that's to make
Snow White Collection I wanna I need to
look into that people keep telling you
about it I haven't looked into it
oops two four seven says love my peach
palette I just I can just lose look and
smell it forever I know if they would
even come out with a strawberry palette
I would totally lose my mind
I am like I'm gonna lose it when the
strawberry stuff comes out
I'm thinking the strawberry stuff is my
production is gonna be coming out next
spring you know like coming out like
that that spring pop like after the
drugstore pop in January February we're
gonna start we'll start seeing speed
peaks of it in like the holiday season
like right after the holiday season and
then it'll pop off in like March or
April that's my prediction on the
toothpaste strawberry I think they're
developing it now that's my thought you
never know what to face but that's my
boy
all right next up because we only have
10 minutes left oh my gosh I'm running
out of battery that is not good it's
Mike Mike charted only downstairs mm-hmm
okay US law what beauty product you
neglect due to laziness and neglecting
big ladies net laziness lip liner number
one is lip liner I am very lazy when it
comes to lip liner like I have to
consciously make a choice to use lip
liner and most of the time what ends up
happening is I'll put on like a dark
lipstick oh the lies I need a lip liner
I'll have to take it off put on the lip
liner and then reapply the lipstick
because I always forget I wore neutral
lipsticks for so long that I definitely
need a lip liner Lisa did you like any
of the lip liner and then now that I'm
wearing some darker colors and forget
that iconic should be wearing a lip
liner sometimes so lip liner definitely
and then finishing powder I just forget
sometimes I just I don't I just I'm like
okay I'm gonna leave you know and you
guys know I don't like setting strays I
can't even with the Sonny's face
you're not even Julie says lip products
and general Taylor says brows Katie says
I've neglect eyeliner Alyssa lip liner
asked then my beauty sponge again lazy
about the wedding it yeah absolutely
now he says I never use eyeliner Celtic
I thought it's like Celtic fur because
my my contacts are going crazy
she says bronzer Devyn oMG strawberry
literally I know right there's a sneak
on Jerrod Blandino Instagram you'll see
like a strawberry almost looks like a
strawberry champagne you drink and it
says I see I think the new collection is
coming something like that yeah I see a
collections being born
yeah lip liner eyeliner contour lip
liner here please just like all that all
that dish says bronzer and highlighter
and stuff says look like alright Prai
what beauty product gives you the most
confidence and I thought about this and
I tried to think about this what beauty
product is me the most confidence and I
honestly like I don't think it's one
particular beauty product that gives me
confidence I think it's one a whole look
comes together when when I'm done and I
look and I go you know I'm like that
looks pretty good I think I did all
right
you know I think that's when I feel that
confidence it's not really one
particular product and like I don't know
I'm the kind of person that I don't
really like I worked really really hard
on my self-confidence but it's a long
long and hard on my self-confidence I've
gone through periods in time in my life
where I was not happy with who I was I
was oh my gosh I was a mess oh that's
for a long time and it took me a while
to find myself and you know and I think
because of that I don't allow myself to
let makeup give me confidence you know
what I mean like I kind of cut it off
and go no you know like this is not
where you should be getting the
confidence from you know I kind of like
stopped myself mentally because I had
this whole period of time where I was so
broken you know and and I feel like it's
great then we wear makeup to give us
confidence but I don't feel like for me
personally that's something that I want
to rely on for confidence you know I
think just knowing that I'm a good
person I think that's where I try to
draw my confidence from is just knowing
that I care about people and that I will
go out of my way to help somebody like
and I don't expect anything in return
you know and I feel like that that that
makes me feel good about Who I am as a
person and you know that I want to
contribute to the world I want to help
people so it's not even really you know
a lot of my helping people on things
that I do is self serving
and then it gives me help it makes me
feel good about myself and in the end
it's kind of about me wanting to help
people
because it makes me feel good about Who
I am if that makes sense so the makeup
thing is kind of on top of that it's
kind of like oh I'm doing myself therapy
right now can you tell it's the makeup
thing is just kind of an added on like
fun thing you know what I mean like it's
more fun it doesn't really give me
something inside it's more external
add-on like frosting
you know cake is good cake is delicious
but if it's got frosting like more on
another level here and that's the way I
feel about makeup you know that's just
me I don't know sometimes I just go off
at the mouth and like chat and I'm
hoping that I won't be misinterpreted
moving on okay the next one is really
weird if you've lost and it says what
attributes you find most attractive in
the opposite sex
what's pretty sexually come from so if I
had to answer that question I would say
you know relax is really important to me
when I'm around people and they're too
high-strung and they have too much
energy and they're too like oh it
stresses me out
like it makes me gives me anxiety when
people were liking people but I know I
talk fast and they're really intense
moving physics like it's exhausting for
me it's exhausting for me so somebody
that's very relaxed and can have a
conversation like and like my husband
like we just sit and we have
conversations about things and deep
thoughts about things and life and all
of that like I find that very attractive
and people in general not just the
opposite sex but in people in general
that I can have a conversation about
something other than something they're
in surface you know I mean I'm really
getting to like then maybe Gritty of
things yeah and humor humor Collin Holly
says yeah absolutely
Deirdre says confident yet humble Holly
says oh not those both we would be
talking about ELISA a sense of humor is
a must absolutely somebody looks too
serious forget it you got to be able to
joke my husband is a little bit
my husband's a little bit inappropriate
sometimes it takes the humor a little
far and he he thinks he's funny it's
like okay that you took that over line
but I don't care I've learned to live
with it I love you so much Ron does this
humor by far yes dreama says hi Jenna
made it oh I'm so glad you're doing so
happy we're here
alright what I wanted to change this
last one - we only have five minutes
left is the product that I'm lusting
after right now which is kind of like
we'll combine it with envy envy says
what ideas would you most likely to look
like to receive as a gift there's
certain things that I'm looking at that
I'm kind of lusting after that I'm like
like the new cataract eye shadow
palettes I'm looking at them like like I
got a light controlled way but I I'm so
curious what her eye shadow fun was
gonna be like like that I mean I know
she's come out with like different eye
products and stuff but she isn't that
with pressed eyeshadow palettes like
this before so I was really lost and
after those and that would be awesome
the new to face foundation I'm really
interested in each one I want to try
that one out but other than that there's
nothing that I'm really like dying over
I thought about getting that believe or
not the cure My Little Pony palette but
I don't know there's something about it
like the fact that it's my little pony
is why is it turning me off so bad you
know like the trolls I didn't get the
troll dust left on the trolls and people
said it was amazing and then now that my
little pony is coming out it's like
there's just something about it I can't
bring myself to get it even though it
looks really pretty just becoming
smiling at home because it shouldn't be
about what the label is I mean I said it
should be whether I'm attracted to the
color skin which I am I don't know the
volume went down more and said I don't
know what happened we got a spare kick
the spammer out come on
wrench punches kick out that spammer can
I kick out the spammer you guys kick the
spammer yet oh he's gone yay
bunny spammer
at least this is a busy our pilot spat
powder and foundation yes Becky says
after today I'm lesson for the
strawberry colic yes Tara says she loves
a lot of checks thank you so much Lee
says I've always wanted the Tom Ford
Soleil bronzer all that stuff all that
looks super high-end stuff that is
wonder if it's really that good that's
like talking lights because she um she
just a lot of reviews where she talks
about whether high-end products are
worth it or not and I really appreciate
that because I you know it's just if
this a high price tag doesn't mean that
it's good hockey does to Steph judo
picton thank you so much I appreciate it
well done wrench punches well done there
if you differ not here in live Chuck
there's a little wrench next to me on
the moderators quick chat so well done
Kathy says my little pony renamed if you
want adults to buy it yeah I mean I
think like I have you know sentimental
attachment to my little pony but I don't
know man it's taking a little farm man
turns the straw it pinched me really
struck two places coming up the
strawberry collection at some point yeah
great craziest beauty movie says I want
to try the luminous silk foundation
who's your eye palette from Mary Shauna
says who wouldn't fall in love with
Kathleen Kathleen is pretty fab I did
meet her once but it was a very short
conversation and it didn't go beyond a
very short conversation he says I'm sure
you're at the edge extreme but I thought
I'd drop on here oh the dreamcatcher in
that lovely girl Fred if you don't know
her channel check out the dreamcatcher
you'll really like her
Audrey Emily Noel - yes another really
great channel absolutely totally agreed
Ashley I want to see a fall spice
collection would not be nice that would
be nice all right I'm gonna go ahead and
pop off here then battery's about to die
is it nine percent I'm nervous it's just
gonna cut off so I want to thank you
guys so much for being here we're done
with our two tags if you have
suggestions for the old school times
you'd like to do next week I'd love to
do these again next week I believe next
is our last Sunday in the month let's
check it sure is let's do a 5 p.m. chat
next Sunday how about that that will be
the plan definitely keep an eye on the
end of what's the makeup for next week
for full confirmation of whether it's at
5 p.m. if I find out I can't do the 5
p.m. I will let you know on twitter
follow me on Twitter and on snapchat I
probably put on its I'd like to like an
Instagram story that's what we'll do if
for some reason we can't do 5 p.m. next
week I'll put it on Twitter I'll put in
an Instagram story and I'll put on
snapchat I'm Jen Lowe's reviews
everywhere snapchat I might be Jen love
je and Lu Zhi instead of Jen lows
reviews I'm not sure so check that I'm
back on snapchat if it's not chatting
more lately so follow me over there and
that way then though whether it's it
loud or not but the plan will be for 5
p.m. next week and yeah again leave your
thoughts on what tags we should do next

backup he is like a beauty guru tag
