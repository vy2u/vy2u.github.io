the words of it makeup chat and welcome
to the collective brain of makeup
awesomeness you are a part of it whether
you are here alive or you're watching on
the replay you are a part of the
collective brain and our job as a
collective brain is to help each other
to save money and not spend money on
crap did we don't need and to spend
money on things that we are actually
really really good that make us really
happy in our hearts so yeah today we're
gonna be doing another Beauty tag and I
think this one's gonna be really fun it
sounds kind of lame it's called the xxx
beauty questions tag which is very
generic sounding but it's kind of hard
to like put all these questions into
like one idea because it's it's a
question it's questions about products
about preferences about thoughts about
ideas and I think it's a really good tag
I don't know if I did this exact one I
don't think I did I think I did a xxx
any questions tag years ago but I don't
think it was this one so I'm excited to
answer these questions with you but
before we do before we do you're gonna
go ahead and say hello to the people who
were here live in the collective brain
of makeup awesomeness
also known as people who are in the live
chat I'm gonna go ahead and go over and
I'm gonna scroll all the way up to the
top to see who was here first so we've
got Kareem here she says I might the
only one we saw Sarge s in the house
from Rainey Texas hopefully you're
staying dry Judith is here in North from
North Carolina Kareem got some friends
coming in that's good faiza is here 2:30
a.m.
faiza I love you girl fun I love you so
much I am so happy you're here um let's
see that sausage s she's in Austin she's
housing some evacuees from Houston that
was very kind of you
brandy is here she's happy to be here
because Elijah is here from soggy
toxicants Maria's here
and it's here so it's good evening from
Norway everybody I'm going to fall
asleep with Jen's voice in the
background and then watch the replay
tomorrow at 11:00 p.m. here well that is
so sweet I take that as a huge
compliment I'm a big ASMR person myself
if you don't know ask them how you can
do that it's very very good but
listening to voices as I go to sleep
really really helps me I actually tried
to start an ass on our channel and I
fell off a bit um I get a lot of
compliments in my voice for a like
relaxation which is odd because I'm kind
of a high-energy person but I think
that's really really awesome I take that
as a huge compliment
Alison is here hello my friend amber is
here and Latika is here Pfizer's just
dropping by to say hi she's got a good
she's got a goodie bag hey okay is
finally here Nadine is here I need Z and
you walk Kayleigh and Aspen it's her and
Julie and Steph is here and Dan is here
and I have to go all the way down to the
bottom because I'm spending a lot of
time saying hi and I don't want to spend
the whole time Sam hi I'm Ronnie four
minutes in maybe two or three minutes in
at this point three minutes in so let's
go ahead and get started with this tag
if you're watching this on the replay
you can feel free to answer any of the
questions in the comments below don't
feel like you need to watch the whole
video and compiled it into one comment
you can actually comment as many times
as you like and that actually helps me
because the more comments you leave the
more engaged to look to be to the
algorithm and the more YouTube likes me
so as many comments who you want to
leave totally cool with me then people
don't tell you that that's why they've
worn a lot of comments you know snapchat
fan the reason why people have the
snapchat fam is so you go and leave lots
of comments so they look super engaged
so they get better and you could do two
algorithm and to get more views so
that's the reason why and also it's kind
of cool to see who we don't snapchat too
but that's a good reason to so lots of
comments are really good for youtubers
alright so anyway back on topic first
question is you remember your first
makeup item so think back stick you
remember your first makeup item I think
I do remember my first
item and I think it was a pencil black
eyeliner from covergirl and I wore it
right here and that was it that was my
thing back when I was 13 and 19 so yeah
yeah that was my first makeup item that
was all I worked for a long time
eyeliner anything soon after was mascara
and lip gloss do you start wearing
foundation till college you know a
little bit of blush and stuff like that
but like I shine all that stuff all that
stuff came in college I remember trying
to match I worked Outback Steakhouse for
seven years and I remember trying to
match my eyeshadow to whatever we used
to wear these bright colored shirts with
all the pins on them I tried to match my
eyeshadow to whatever color shirt I was
wearing that day so yeah all right let's
look in the community people are saying
super sex eyeliner little bugs thank you
for being honest it means so much of
course I don't like sometimes they don't
think about things that's not reason why
I would hide something is if I just I
wouldn't be it like intentionally hiding
something would be just I didn't think
to tell you but I try to be as honest as
possible about everything um let's see
Maybelline black eyeliner from Sandra
and a new song says roll-on lip gloss
oh girl forgot about that Jerrod I says
I miss your diet yes says cupboard look
proper girl invisible concealer oh my
gosh what's the point of an invisible
concealer I don't even know Julie says
blue eye shadow back in the seventies
crystal says lip gloss yeah
I'm really worried lip gloss at some
point I don't think lip smackers town as
a cosmetic though I wouldn't count those
but lip smackers would probably be my
like technical first cosmetic because I
did wear a lot of lip smackers back in
the day
all right number two describe your
perfect mascara have you found one that
fits your specifications my perfect
mascara does not exist as of now because
I have little tiny shorts far stubby
lashes I would love for a mascara to
truly truly make it look like I have
false lashes on that would be amazing I
think something that fiber mascaras got
close
but they've got goofy and the fibers get
in my eyes it was a nice thought that
didn't really work closest that I've
found are my essence I talked about mass
since mascaras all the time the last
Princess Leia essence lead Jordanna best
lash extreme this steel a huge mascara
is really really good
Urban Decay perversion is really really
good
those are probably the ones I like the
best today I'm wearing the bombs mad
lash mascara I just thought you didn't
see my Instagram story in my my snapchat
if your father's gonna find me
ungenerous reviews everywhere I might be
Jen love on snapchat though but Jen
loves reviews I think they look funny I
just got a PR package from the balm so I
want to do this week I'd love to do but
getting ready with you of some of the
stuff because it's a lot of they're
brand new stuff and I really want to
show you so yeah so those who probably
make the closest ones that I found but
but ya know nothing that really truly
gives me that false lash look just
because my lashes are so short Sheila
says my high school music teacher gave
me a green level on eyeshadow quad as a
grad gift oh my gosh that's awesome
Jenna says I love Marc Jacobs but it
dries out
Jaz says I can live without mascara so I
don't put much thought into it
Jamie says Pacifica mascara is my second
favorite I didn't have good luck with
that one oh wow that's amazing I'm glad
that one works for you Danny Avila huge
is also amazing I totally agree oh it
skipped down see Johnson says the bomb
rocks I make the bang we're doing Jordan
the Matt lashes the only cosmetic I
found that's ever irritate my eyes wow
that's great to know I wonder what it is
in there that's bothering here little
slice of TLC Maybelline colossal so far
and that says L'Oreal telescopic
Stacey says lash paradise that's another
L'Oreal fab okay moving on to the next
one number three what kind of coverage
do you prefer from a foundation I
believe this was made before BB creams
and CC creams came to the US market but
I prefer a light to medium coverage for
my everyday for filming I go medium to a
little bit more full but I don't ever go
in like truthful I don't like the way it
looks on me it's not my fave
pull it off and look like a china doll I
got other predict ulis in full coverage
foundation
I just don't like it but um but yeah I'm
like a light to medium person and that
really is mostly due to the fact that
they don't have a lot of discoloration
my skin I don't have a lot of blemishes
things like that to need more coverage
that's really where it comes down to for
me so let's look at the collective brain
aspen says medium to full Jessica medium
to full Jenny light I have relatively
good skin and I'd like to see my skin
underneath I'm with you on that like
I've got freckles and stuff I couldn't
like just see my freckles cyr na told me
your real name when I forgot I'm sorry
she says I'm liking the light to medium
coverage to I'm not enjoying full
coverage anymore the beauty song light
to medium coverage to hide a medium
buildable coverage probably a full
coverage for her and it says hey I've
just made it made it I'm in Houston and
the weather is horrible oh my god stay
dry stay dry Stevie says medium coverage
and Annie says medium-high
Annie just left me a really nice comment
on my giveaway video and I haven't had a
chance to respond to it but I loved your
comment thank you so much and II thought
that was really really sweet of you
alright let's move on to the next one
favorite high-end brand and this one's
really hard for me because I feel like
every brand has let me down at some
point I wouldn't consider Julia's place
a high-end brand but its high-end
quality Judy's place is literally the
only brand while uncolored raining
Jimmy's place in color brain are the
only brands that have never let you down
about anything but they also have a
smaller range of different types of
products to choose from too so they have
a nice much opportunity to let me down
down sorry they just got popped into my
head but yeah I would say those two
brands but I coloured raine is probably
more high ends there are a little more
expensive jeebies place is actually
quite affordable I would say it's in
between like the drugstore value range
um as far as the mainstream brands that
are not in the brands we have one like I
can the bomb yeah there you go Aegis
says the ball yeah
all probably but there's still some
misses in the ball but I do like to bone
a lot I love ya but I'm gonna bomb
collector if you don't know this I have
a bomb a two ball brand reviews I won
from a long time ago when it's more
recent lorac is another really good one
the rock has a lot of good stuff Georgia
the rock does have a lot of good stuff
I'm urban decay for Nancy Tamm says
Anasazi Beverly Hills
Florence marc jacobs debbie says Kat Von
D an hourglass Connie has a lot of good
stuff too but definitely have some wet
down there Michelle one of our fabulous
reporters Facebook admin amazing person
all around she says it cosmetics Sandra
says malaguti Natalie really it's so
interesting I haven't had a lot of good
luck with Malley that's wonderful that
that's been working for you joe says
Tarte and Kat Von D Stacy oh I lost a
CEO man Stacy lost Stacy no it's buried
it's gone hey Mallory's here she's this
so happy like your star Valerie Barton
got me I'm a big shame paid for it but
she named the star after me I don't know
like I've never seen that before so I
don't know but that was really cool in
celebration of my 10 million views I
thought that was really sweet of her and
it's in Gemini my stars in Gemini and
that's my Sun signs I thought that was
really cute really sweet hurt to get me
a star always sometimes just says Dior
and Debbie says it cosmetics all right
let's go ahead into the next question
number five what cosmetic brand hope you
always wanted to try but still haven't I
thought about this one when I saw the
questions I can't think of a single
brand that I haven't tried that I want
to that's like a mainstream brand the
only brands I can think of that I really
want to try that I haven't or like indie
brands and like there are a lot of the
ones that we haven't like I haven't
featured like then we feature in sorry
wake up Jen there are a lot of ones that
we feature in the Andy section that Anna
puts into any section that I have to try
that I would love to like you know like
Luke see beauty and aroma Li cosmetics
and you know some of those smaller
brands that people are really
just say they're amazing and I've never
tried any of them so I would love to try
stuff from some more of those indie
brands but as far as mainstream brands
like I've never tried anything from Tom
Ford but I don't know if I really want
to like I don't know if that's something
I want to do I do wonder likes I watched
Ozzy's videos where she talks about the
high-end print that she loves like I
wonder like Sicily and stuff like that
like whether they really truly are worth
the highway she said they are but you
know are you kind of like I like to know
things for myself like I trust a lot of
people but you know I I feel like yeah
I've got their preferences and I just
you know I kind of like to know for
myself whether it's good enough but I
can't bring myself to spend you know
$200 on a face primer I mean that's just
not going to happen it's not gonna I
don't think I feel like that's just
ridiculous $200 for a face primer that's
like going into a restaurant and
ordering you know a $300 meal or you
know going to get a $75 piece of pie I
don't know I just don't get it
let's leave with the collective brain is
talking about goodvery one says I've not
tried Kevin a Quan some really good
stuff from having a Quan Nancy says
Sicily mmm
Louis a busy art fiery arias that's our
glass but they're pricey I know they are
I know they aren't they do have some
really good stuff though like they're
their face powders are really good like
they're highlighters are really nice
they're they're nice and subtle they're
not like super from space which I really
like some evil courses Judy's place is
so good i think i said that right that's
a very interesting name city says the
bomb Valerie says girl I would paint I
would pay for it through no dollar meal
if it was amazing I don't even know if I
would I don't think I would I think like
a hundred dollars is kind of my cap for
a like a really really fancy you know
you know like I Amanda it makes me
cringe like anything over $50 for like a
mall is too much for me like that's even
$50 it is too much like I'm more I'm
like a twenty dollar person like where
that's kind of like where my comfort
zone is I think everyone's got their
comfort zone but even then that's like
rarity for the 20 all right we're off
topic let's keep going all right moving
on okay
hmm favorite drugstore brand favorite
drugstore brand for a long time was
L'Oreal but recently I would say yes
I feel like NYX has really improved a
lot of things where before like their
eyes shuttle formula was kind of like
their lip formulas were like man the
blush formulas were good I always like
the blush as I think but if you're like
lately mix has really been stepping up
their game I remember trying eyeliners
back a long time ago for them and didn't
really like those but like then the new
want the NYX
what is it the epic ink liner and that
Cassie from tryptic just reviewed oh my
gosh like really and truly I didn't
watch her review yet but it is it's
amazing it really is for me just as good
as the Kat Von D and steel at one I mean
it's it's amazing I wear it every day
now I can't even bring myself to wear
another eyeliner because it's just
everything I need it's amazing I'm
waiting to give you the final verdict so
I want to see if it's gonna dry out I
think feel like it's really important
like the longevity of an Iowan or so I'm
kind of floating off on that also next
being quilted free well are they closing
free now it's free I think they're like
half full t3 because they're like one of
those that like the parent company is a
cruelty free I'm trying to get like like
more cruelty free supportive I'm not
going completely cruelty free for
different reasons but I want to get more
cruelty free as much cruelty free as I
can I'm trying to be more conscious with
my purchases but I you know it's hard as
we're here to go completely cruelty free
I know some people do but it is hard but
anyway some of you are gonna get mad at
me for saying that but I'm sorry I'm
gonna stop talking about that oh let me
go to brain real quick Oh Riley says
they are cruelty free okay cool
awesome there we go for some reason I
was thinking that their parent company
wasn't cool t3
AJ says I got into NYX because their
spot they sponsored RuPaul's Drag Race
oh wow nice Angela says wet and wild elf
L'Oreal and they believe is true formula
butter bronzer yeah
Ali says I just bought the epic egg from
old say you're gonna love it I am Burgin
says forgot about acids oh yeah in
essence I love essence essence it was
another really really good one
definitely I found lately I've had more
misses from essence than Nicks but I do
really like essence a lot I would say
they're close second thank you for the
reminder on essence I appreciate that
NYX is L'Oreal that's what I thought
that's wife I thought they were owned by
L'Oreal yeah so it's like the whole
parent company thing so it kills me
absolutely kills me and there was a
thing for a while where L'Oreal was
going and I was Maybelline what's going
on - they're owned by L'Oreal - was
going on like a Twitter spree when they
were like tweeting out how you know they
are cruelty free but they let people
test on their behalf like the brand
doesn't test on animals but they allow
people to test their products on animals
in order to sell them in China so it's
almost like you know I didn't have the
the narcotics I just you know let them
get the narcotics for me you know I just
made the money off of it you know it's
just I don't know hmm I don't like it's
kind of shady you know alright anyway
moving on you wear fake eyelashes only
to film and for a date night with my
husband I would look up fake lashes but
I definitely don't wear them on the day
today that's too much do you know I do
really like fake lashes I didn't wear
fake lashes for the longest time and the
on reason why I started wearing fake
lashes was because of my friends on
periscope they convinced me to do it
they helped me the first time I did it
and I'm addicted ever since so some
people here probably were here when
we're there in that scope and that
periscope Paris Paris cups an app owned
by Twitter it's a life journey have some
people were probably there that first
day when I put on lashes for the first
time it was very interesting I was
freaking out a little bit
number eight is there any kind of makeup
you can't leave the house without no no
I'd go without makeup all the time look
at least once or twice a week I go
without makeup all day these aren't
really community questions as much so
let's get to the good ones what is your
most cherished beauty product this is
gonna be a really good one for the
community - my most cherished beauty
is if I have sentimental attachment to
this this is the you guys have seen as
so many times now at this point this is
the Alice Through the Looking Glass
palette by urban decay I love this
palette I love it
it's so fun to play with it's such a
weird combination of colors but I'm just
mostly just a huge Alice in Wonderland
person through the looking-glass is one
of my favorite stories ever it's also
got in here on if you remember this
you've seen this but you opened it up
and then there's a good butterfly inside
and it's just so pretty it says I'm not
strange weird off nor crazy my reality
is just different from yours and I just
I just love Alice in Wonderland in
general and just the concept of
perspective you know and and how your
perspective can change I don't know it's
like over time as you grow and also
depending on who you are and where you
grew up and and what your life was like
and how Alice gets thrown into this
world where everybody has a different
perspective than her and I think we've
all been in the situation where you know
we get in a situation and we feel like
we're Alice in Wonderland like what is
going on like who are these people
around me like I so don't fit in right
now you know and then just finding
yourself in that and and you know
finding your true self by the way the
movie wasn't anything like the book just
so you know the movies not the book is
amazing so anyways I have a sentimental
attachment to this palette I love it I
absolutely love it I do like the movie
but it's not anything like a book
alright let's scroll up a little bit and
talk to the collective brain on this and
says her tarts mop cleaned palette
that's a nice palette I like that one
too
horror Beauty effects has urban decay
has been a brand that disappointed me I
know I'm probably the future but it had
AI decays disappointed me on occasion -
absolutely Kat Von D shade + light eye
contour pot was her first
pyon pyon pyon Michelle says and Circe
says naked3 and pure rose tone how it
arias says Pat Von D shade light eye
palette definitely use it every day
jazz says I don't really read the Jaret
cherish any particular makeup I don't
just can't live without a nice man
full-coverage foundation there you go
everyone's got their things I love our
shadow palettes fixmestick yeah I love
that stuff
Connie says also Wonderland Disney's
animated version is my favorite movie
ever I want my daughter I want my to
name my daughter Alice Oh Shia Shan said
the ride-or-die palette nice nice AJ my
grandma's lipstick plum full from that
she recently passed away
oh those things are so special to like
hold on to those things you know I have
some of my grandma's makeup I still have
it I think you were there for the
decluttering when I cut my grandma's
makeup so I'm totally with you my heart
is with you AJ Julia's place just oh
just uh from Jessica P beauty is here
she says I wish I would have gotten that
palette oh it's one of those things man
I mean it's it's a good crowd I really
hope that everybody comes out with an
epic pilot stand I feel like that I
don't know I was disappointed by the
Nikki heat I was disappointed by it I
wanted it to be more epic it wouldn't
happen you know like a good vice palette
you know something like Dallas palette
is something that's like yes you know
very urban decay like alright moving on
moving on where everywhere we at in time
okay we're 22 minutes in next one how do
you how often you shop for makeup do you
like to pick up an item here and there
or get lots of goodies at once my makeup
shopping is directly correlated with the
channel for the most part so I look and
see what videos I have coming up and I
kind of keep track of what I want to
review and where I want to go and then I
purchase based on that sometimes I end
up doing the video and sometimes I don't
like at one point I brought a bunch of
stuff in essence planned of doing an
essence brand review as I said told me
they were going to send me some things
they never did and I just uh pushing it
up pushing off pushing off and then
never did the video right now I'm
working on a drugstore at liquid
lipstick video so I just put a lot of
money not a lot of money but I put some
investment into a bunch of different
drugstore liquid lipsticks because I
feel like that's a place where I didn't
know a lot about like I hadn't really
investigated that yet and I wanted to
know so and that was fired inspired by
one of our Facebook admins name is you
send me a clay of us if you look back a
long time ago what's the bite Beauty lab
together you can see this
yeah but um but yes so she's kind of the
one that inspired that video and that's
why I'm doing the pointing of here so
I'm looking at all of them standing up
over there so my purchases are really
based on the videos I'm going to create
for the channel because I don't really
need anything it's more channel based
and do I buy a lot of things at once it
just depends on what the video is going
to be sometimes I find nothing you know
buy one thing and sometimes I buy a lot
of things it just depends of the video
like when all that two-faced stuff comes
out and have a really hard time not
going crazy because I want to believe in
two-faced I want to believe that it's
all going to be amazing and it's going
to change my life I don't know why I
feel like the two-faced gets me every
time
alright what about you guys what do you
guys are you like are you you spend a
lot of money to binge and buy a bunch of
stuff but how often do you think you all
shop
Brock says as often as possible in AJ
emotionally shops I definitely been done
that before but Jamie's does a little
bit at a time money spent spread out
mm-hmm
Kendra says once a quarter I like to use
things that first good for you I wish I
could I wish I did that more I wish I
focused on using things up girlfriend I
wish I did
Jordan says I usually spend 10 to 15
dollars a month on drugstore makeup and
only go for high at my birthday or
Christmas yeah there you go sir says I'm
all over the place when it comes to
shopping for makeup and Lea Lea Lea Lea
says I shot the first the month from
different friends so the delivery spread
up through the month well there you go
that's cool nice okay next up do you
have a beauty budget or do you spend
freely I've had a beauty budget and I
had set my beauty budget at $100 a month
but then I realized that then I was
feeling like I wanted to spend $900 and
if I didn't spend it I felt like I
wanted to keep spending so instead of
setting my beauty budget at $100 a month
I make sure I don't overbuy so I buy
purposefully and I buy only for specific
videos and I don't really have a budget
anymore
I tend to spend less that way and that's
kind of been where I'm where I'm at with
that I also have super check money if
you don't know what super chat is it's a
way for people to donate to the channel
I saw some super chat money that I'm
working on getting through and using
that for good so that is going toward
the products that I've been purchasing
recently so it's a little bit different
I think with me but I'm definitely a
huge fan of budget because it's easy to
get out of control I mean consumerism is
seriously real and it's easy to go out
of control but some people don't need to
have a budget and that's perfectly okay
if you're somebody that doesn't need a
budget then that's that's awesome for
you and there's no judgement there no
judgement here Julie says she spends too
much alexandra says I spend freely in a
way my husband and I always talk to each
other about hobby purchases so I do plan
on that way nice Tamm says I tried the
budget and I realize I suck at it
I have a video from a really long time
ago it's in black and white and it's I
think it said I think it's called I have
a problem and it's all about how I view
my budget this is when I first started
my channel
and it's really actually a very funny
video it's about me about four or five
minutes long something like that's a
nice short video but it's pretty funny I
forgot exactly what it's called I'll
link it down down below for people on
the replay I'll find it and like that
but it's pretty fun it's just basically
about how a pair o Andy's I have an
addiction and it's gone so I've
definitely gotten better every time of
it but my collection is growing over
time I don't feel like I want as much or
need as much as I used to twelve do you
utilize coupons reward cards and sales
when you shop for cosmetics absolutely
asilah just had a sale and I wanted
another one of the Stila the glitter
topper eyeshadow things that I can't
think of what they're called right now
but the steal of glittery thingies and I
looked at all the colors I have two and
I wanted at least one more I ended up
getting the silver one but I looked at
all the other colors and I had like five
in my part and I just got knocking about
knocking about knocking out and I've
just been the silver one but I've I've
those were so long but I haven't gotten
them because of the price point that's
the only reason why I haven't gotten
them and then when they had to sale
that's when I jumped on it and bought
that one and now I feel like I'm good I
think I'm solid on those but yeah the
supports say on the altar sale I try
really hard to wait to buy things and
sell them if it's gonna be like a
splurge item that I'm not necessarily
good news for the channel like the Stila
I'm not really planning on using it for
the channel except for to wear it in
videos but I just really wanted it to be
expensive but yes I definitely use
coupon what coming up coupons at Ulta I
do use coupons at all - but we're word
codes and things like that definitely
number 13 what type of product you buy
the most of I shadow there's no doubt
about it I shadow is the thing that I
love the most I love you saw a shadow I
want to know what everyone else's is
what's your what's your number one thing
that you buy the most of everyone's
talking about the 20% coupon that old -
just sent out but it's not on prestige
stephanie says that's true your step
SSS SSS highlighters Sierra says sales
are money murder for me will have me a
good sale I know right he baits is great
Terry yes I shop on he paint using dates
all the time I have my Ebates code under
most of my videos I don't think it's
under my chat but but that gets me money
once you sign it you think you smiling I
should oh my goodness is blowing up and
blowing up it's going to BES ok a little
slow it down slow it down alright that
says I shut up Alex Haley says highlight
Meghan says eyeshadow from highlighters
Julie eyeshadow Tiffany dawn eyeshadow
palettes that makeup junkie lashes and
lip products anya highlighters summer
says i had over 250 shadow singles
girlfriend Lisa sent flush in lipstick
Sierra says highlighters stamp in pong I
shut up here too door says eyeliner
concealer
Micheline what Michelle Michelle eNOS -
now I'm sad about right
what's cream eyeshadow for her Katherine
says lips and crystal says holiday
eyeshadow palettes on
oh my gosh in dijanna I'm gonna say I
hope I got that rights and bronzers
which is different there you go
lots of different things I think we all
have that thing that just makes us happy
to either either and they feel like we
feel like it makes us look a certain way
that we enjoy or just applying it you
know it makes us happy I think it's
whatever product for those the most joy
so yeah yeah that's me on shadows my
favorite if you're as they're a brand
that you absolutely can't stand okay
beauty brands that you can't stand
there's I had to think about this for a
minute and nothing came to me at first
and then this one and it's not personal
against the brand I had a bad experience
in the very beginning of the brand life
first started my channel and I haven't
been able to get over it and I am NOT a
Drudge holding person okay I don't hold
grudges but for some reason I cannot get
past that I don't like this brand I have
you literally not tried hardly anything
from this brand in the past three years
if he won't tell me it's amazing and
it's pixie Beauty pixie and pop you need
both of them for some reason I've got it
in my head there stuff is not good and I
can't get it out I cannot get it out of
my head and I feel like that's my
problem not pixie and pop huge problem
because I have friends that swear by
their stuff that it's awesome I can't
get past it and I looked I have some
stuff from them that I got in a
generation beauty and I look at it and I
go man and I pick something else someday
I need to just suck it up and try it
that's just kind of the way that I feel
about it
makeup chemist says Kylie and k'kaw you
know with Ty Lee you know when she was
when I thought that she was an indie
brand you know what she sucked if Lee is
still an immigrant you know making any
money the onion issues never making any
money way I realized how much money that
woman was making
once I realized that I was like why why
why are we spending all this money on
this stuff I mean the the parent brand
is colour-pop so we'll talk across other
pepperin there's a parent brand that
owns color pop and Kylie I don't know if
they own k'kaw but people have said over
and over that the liquid lipsticks are
very similar between the two brands so
why buy the Kylie if you can just get
the color pop you know I heard bad
things about the eyeshadows they had the
stinky eyeshadow palette thing for a
while like the real stinky peach palette
where everybody was like people had to
put it in their garages people that
smelled so bad I've heard customer
service is terrible I haven't had any
personal experience with it I have one
liquid lipstick and one lip liner that
were sent to me and I actually kind of
like them to be honest with you but I'm
definitely not going out of my way to
get it yes that's loud there you go
Connie that's the parent company says
Papa Kylie's formula are different I can
attest to that okay Thank You staff for
clarifying that they are owned by the
same company but I guess that they do do
different formulas in there because
there's lots of parent companies that
own lots of companies and that the
formulas are different a lot of people
are talking my jeffree star cosmetics
the parent company is called stats labs
someone was kind enough to put that in
there Mandy says I'm weary of morphine I
you know the Jaclyn help palette kind of
turned me around on morphine because I
did really really like that I do really
really like that palette every brush
I've ever tried from morphe I haven't
liked I haven't liked a single brush
I've tried and like the the 35 to 35 OS
and the 35 om
I didn't really like them very much
they're okay but the the the newest
formula the Jacqueline health formula is
really good the 25 camp outside heated
to my Jacqueline hell video the 25 pan
pilots have the same they're like the
square pallets those have the same
formula as the Jacqueline Hill so if you
want if you don't want to buy the
Jacqueline help you want something a
little bit more mucho you a little bit
smaller though for the 25 camp outs from
working Gerard cosmetics what happened
to them they just like sunk into a black
hole I very rarely see them if I do
them it's from a small influencer on
Instagram very rarely I haven't tried
anything from put a beauty I don't know
I don't I didn't hear I know my friend
is Shani ever total makeup junkie 101
she didn't like the put a booty call any
of that alright let's move on because we
are at 30 34 minutes hand so let's see
what's next I better start marking its
ups I'm losing where I'm at okay do you
avoid certain ingredients in cosmetics
like parabens or sulfates I am an
ingredient junkie y'all notice you know
yes I love looking up ingredients but
I'm going to be honest with you do I
specifically avoid any specific
ingredients no I don't I don't I mean a
flick
do I like purposely by makeup that I
know is junk no except for one thing let
me show you like one junk thing that I
bought because I had to I had to I had
to buy this and I'm embarrassed that I
bought this but it's not that bad I
don't know it's this is the supernatural
palette and i got this from hot topic
and it says supernatural join the hunt
and it's a nice shout out because I love
to show Supernatural Valerie's here hi
Valerie Valerie Christopher natural
friend but like it's not the most I've
used it like three times and I was okay
it's okay but I mean this is just
straight from China like not good
quality stuff at all but it means not
it's not a terrible palette but I don't
I definitely don't trust where it comes
from you know that these are high
quality ingredients so I can't say that
I you know specifically go for one thing
or another but I just
this was like a lemon everyone swaps
back on Hot Topic a so you keep your eye
out for it in the supernatural section
of hot topics website but like I mean
they have a shadow named baby after his
car and there's jerk and there's angel
and hunter and pie there's a shadow main
highway and ass but and you know how do
you not use that
not love that so yeah there isn't
anything that I can keep the employed
even though I'm a junkie but I have to
be honest I can't lie and say yeah so
you know I love ingredients and I make
sure I only buy this listen isn't that's
not true it's just not true so you know
I mean there as far as the China because
now there's a discussion about the China
thing you can get products from China
that are not sold in China that are of
higher quality just because I mean China
doesn't use bad quality but I would
imagine this eyeshadow palette from Hot
Topic
is probably not good at URI yes that's
my guess I mean it was it's labeled as
the $14 90 cent how I think I paid $11
for it
you know so Jesse wants know if I've
gone to any conventions no and I won't
ever because I will I would fall on the
ground if I ever actually saw any of
those people in person I don't think I'd
be able to handle myself
I think I could just be a flipping mess
but I couldn't do it I could I couldn't
do it
alright anyway moving on number 16 do
you have a favorite place to shop for
makeup it used to be supported now it's
also because I couldn't get more stuff
that all the time when I can't support
stuff that I want but I do like support
too but I like both suck I'm a fan of
all time do you how do you avoid certain
names or you get apart okay do you like
try new skincare products or do you keep
a certain routine so we're skin care
products I'm usually working on
something for reviews so I'm hopefully
I'm planning on filming my ordinary
video this week that's a goal because
I've been waiting to do this video for
literally months I've been wanting to do
my video on the ordinary I stopped using
that skincare at months ago and now I'm
using a different brand that I'm working
on a brand with you for and then I have
another brand waiting in the waiting of
the wings
yeah right here I put on here this is
they sent this to me this is new do
natural beauty and they sent me a bunch
of stuff I looked at their ingredients
and their ingredients look like but
they looked really good so that's why I
wanted to review this so this is
nudee beauty and udu beauty so I'm gonna
try this but I have to get through my
ordinary of you then I have to get
through the next review and then I'm
gonna go into this one so so yeah I
usually do my skincare based on whatever
I'm trying to review I why did I stop
why did I stop using the ordinary stuff
I'll get more into detail during the
review oh well I was using polished toys
for a very very long time ever since I
did the sponsor video for them I was
using Polish toys I would say they are
still my favorite skincare brand even
through these other ones that I've been
trying there's still my favorite I still
have products buy them but they're like
sitting waiting to be used because I'm
trying to do skincare reviews and if I
use the Polish toy stuff and that's
gonna interfere with the products that
I'm testing and I don't want my awesome
published choice up to you know negate
my results from the rest of it
you know what I mean so uh so yeah you
know Debbie says she's not a fan of
Polish choice that makes me sad I love
it I'm sorry I didn't work for you and
you are not the first person to say that
Debbie I've heard that from quite a few
people it seems to be that you know you
either into their work for you or didn't
and I'm finding at least from from what
I see in my comments is about 80% works
in about 20% it doesn't but that 20% is
still extremely valid
extremely valid Shirley says they keep
hearing pixie is really good but I
picked up that L'Oreal codemaster try it
Oh summer says I would never give up my
boy girl products to test new stuff but
now I'm gonna test skincare if I have to
if I find using this awesome stuff along
with it isn't that gonna like mess with
my review of the stuff I'm using I can't
do that bad
they swash for really sensitive skin
girlfriend you gotta go to the facebook

ten more questions what brand do you

easy one for me toothpaste toothpaste

it comes to packaging I like their
packaging and marketing geniuses over
toothpaste it's unreal how good they are
at packaging it's it's unreal
everybody's like don't be sorry I know I
shouldn't be sorry

purpose you know I'm trying to give that
purpose but it is what it is I know

Elvis stuff is so simple you know it is
pretty much what do you bring totally
good okay so let's go on to number 21
which celebrity has great makeup I will
admit this I don't pay attention to
celebrities I'm really and truly don't I
have no idea I honestly have no idea I
used to like sing like JLo who she
always had that JLo glow plus I loved
her Ruby Rose I love me some Ruby Rhodes
but I don't really well I don't watch it
a lot of like celebrity stuff I got a
watch like Inside Edition and like TMZ
and I never watch that stuff so like I
don't know like who the big celebrities
are looking people talk about people
that are on the reality TV shows like
Big Brother or The Bachelor River I like
what any of these people are I'm so in
dark when it comes to that stuff I know
people are like alright on subscribe but
I don't I don't know I don't know
Beyonce Lady Gaga Kylie I guess J loves
and daya Megan Fox aria Ariana perfumes
nice rubber JLo Lady Gaga don't care
Rihanna uh-huh there you go there you go
good stuff alright let's go under the
next ones I'm not really good at that
one I like a terrible question for me 22
do you belong to any online makeup
communities just mine well no that's not
true that my facebook group which is the
what's of the makeup Facebook group is
the one that I'm probably on the most
followed closely by F cos which is for
for video creators
if cos is run by well not run by but if
C is run by the Shelf on and then
Michelle Phan if you don't know her
she's one of the og
gurus and then if see the subscription
bag they have a whole community of video
creators and if C if C Open Studios is
what it's called so I'm on there quite a
lot there's one for everybody and then
there's a forum for channels that have a
certain number and higher it's called
the globe forum that one's not as active
so I'm mostly on the other one but other
than that no that's it those are the big
ones I'm on Oh beauty in the vlog which
is the podcast that's run by my friend
Erica it's amazing so I'm part of the
beauty in the vlog one that's it I like
in my kit I don't just paint in my kit
very often though because I'm not a
makeup artist I mostly like look over in
my kit Jarrod ice let's make a
prediction on reddit yeah I miss me i
lurk on reddit I don't post on reddit I
learn i lurk on guru gossiper just in my
own thread though I don't check out
anybody else's but no miss posted ever
in my thread for a while I'm quite proud
of that but I'm constantly checking
anybody talking trash about me I look
because I want to know how to improve my
channel like you are so singing honest
over there I mean some of its valid some
of its invalid but at least I have the
choice so it's nice to hear like the
other side I'm constantly you know
hearing the good side from all of you
they give me so much love that I love so
much but it's nice to hear why people
don't like me and whether it's something
that I could improve on or it's just you
know I don't like her nose or I don't
like her voice like I can't do anything
about my nose in my voice I'm not going
to do anything about it I probably could
surgery wise but I'm not going to you
know what I mean but so so that's all
like that's ology but I don't post there
except for a minor thread Cassie from
terrific is here hi Cassie this cussed
me and the bud selig I'm happy you're
here to stuff sense the Jeffries thread
is like billions of pages long oh my
gosh I haven't been over there Michelle
wants to know what's reddit reddit is an
online place for conversation about
anything you could possibly want to have
a conversation about if you go to google
and you type reddit and then anything
your interest
then you will find a reddit conversation
about whatever that thing is so there's
a lot of ones about makeup I'm on the
tree and beauty one a lot I like reading
about that that's what I find a lot of
stuff for what the tag is on the Korean
beauty one and then he says you're
perfect that I'm not perfect but thank
you so much for thinking that I
appreciate it
Melinda says the people who talk smack
about you were just wrong oh thank you
but you know what I don't I I learned
from them though because sometimes they
actually have valid points about things
that I'm not perfect and I'm always
trying to improve so five favorite
beauty gurus I made a list of some
people I knew I could never possibly
mention all of the people that I watch
on YouTube i I pretty much that's what I
do in my free time as I watch youtube
videos and my free time is play about an
hour a day because if I'm not you know
playing with my kids cooking dinner are
doing something on YouTube as far as
like the channel goes I have like an
hour a day at most to do something so I
watch YouTube videos is what I do so top
five I can't do but I did make a list of
some of my favorites so Stephanie Nicole
raw beauty Christine
Emily Noel ad-free Kimberly Clark
Jessica from Jam Beauty 89 Bailey B Tara
babies total makeup junkie 101 Morley
talked to Cassie from terrific I wrote
her name down the fancy face Tina from
the fancy face V dreamcatcher
Samantha March glammed it if you don't
know where I'm gonna go talked about her
on on my channel but I really have been
diggin her videos lately Tina Marie true
meaning of radiance I love her she has
like the best attitude it's hard to find
her though because there's so many teen
Marie's so her number is it's TM are two
eight eight six I'll say it again TM are
two eight eight six is her channel name
kind like how I have gendler's reviews
like that's how you would find her she
is like oh she splits sunshine I love
her
Holly forest Taylor from that Tayla
Laura from mrs. Lowell and Gabriel
Tomorrowland gosh Kristin game
Sabrina Jackie ina cackling lights ex
Sparky
Nikki Murphy yay or nay Nicole those are
some of the ones I watched like
religiously all the time Tiffany John
that's here I watch a lot of her videos
so like a very big variety from you know
all different ages and nationally not
nationalities most of them are American
I'm not many nationalities these are all
pretty much all Americans I don't think
any of these people are Americans with
different skin tones different ages
different I love watching a gamut of
different people um everyone about live
loves her makeup a lot of people really
really love her channel she's a very
nice person we had a little bump in the
road at one point but we worked it out
it was all a misunderstanding was all
big miscommunication you heard that
there was drama between me and Liv loves
her makeup there is no drama it was
about 30 seconds of drawing because I
didn't know there was any and as soon as
I found out there was some we cleared it
up and everything's fine so that's a
story that's a story that was totally I
was completely oblivious there was any
problem so you did ever hear that it's
gone now it's over and she'll tell you
the same thing lip gloss Leslie that's
another really great channel surin whoa
yeah definitely lots of good ones I'm
reading what other people are saying
Jessica from Jam Beauty Bailey B I mean
I mostly gravitate toward channels that
I can learn from what you notice like
the first ones that I like wrote down
Stephanie and Kristi and Emily and
Kimberly and Jessica and Bailey and Tara
and you know all all in Cassie and any
Shawnee it sort of make a druggie 101
they're all learning fails they're all
education based it's not all about the
entertainment and the fluff and all of
that like it's very very education based
and learning base and that's what I'm I
gravitate toward I know that some people
use YouTube as an entertainment you know
that it's more for like the leg harder
than the fun and the jokes which I do
like on occasion some of those channels
that I really like her like that but I'm
more about giving the information I want
to know what this product is really like
so that's just my personal preference
alright we are almost out of time we got
six minutes left holy moley alright
do you like multifunctional
that's like lip and cheek stains yes
sometimes I use things for things
they're not really supposed to be met
for I love putting eyeshadow on my lips
I'm weird like that and just have to be
careful make sure their lips safe like
glitter and stuff I love putting like
that's up on my lips
and I like mixing stuff and I'm not
supposed to mix all of that stuff it's
fine
are you clumsy and putting on makeup
sometimes occasionally I can be a little
clumsy
do you use makeup base or primer for the
eyes yes I didn't used to I didn't used
to think it was important and then I
realized that yes it is for me
definitely
what do you apply first concealer or
foundation it depends on what I think
about first if I think about concealer
first off the concealer on core so I
think about foundation first off well
foundation on first there's too much of
a difference on me to be completely
honest with you and if some people can
tell the difference but I can't oh
that's another one got the me stuff oh
my gosh I don't know if I said that
right but that's a good skincare one oh
my gosh
so so smart it's a really good one 29 I
did you ever consider taking makeup
classes yes I would love to if I didn't
if I could just do makeup stuff and not
if I let go and get cosmetology but just
do makeup I would do that but you have
to do the hair and small stuff so but
yes I've definitely thought about that
bonus question what's your first makeup
memory I have said this before my first
makeup memory is sitting on my mother's
floor of her bedroom with her big
dresser drawer open and playing with her
Avon makeup my mom used to sell Avon
when I was little and I would go in her
George there were certain things I was
allowed to play with in certain things I
wasn't a lot of things my mom never
really even liked was that big into
makeup she just sold makeup and she knew
it was good at her products and all that
and she could she could sell it she's
actually really good at selling it but
she wasn't nice she's not really a big
made that person it's very odd but
that's my first memory is is playing
with like her little mini lipsticks and

said my first makeup memory sitting on
the bathroom counter or toilet and
watching my mom curl her lashes sandra
for me it was doing my friends makeup at
parties in middle school I remember at
my 6th grade birthday party that we had
some I had friends over first sleepover
and this one girl brushed my hair out
actually was after the end of fifth
grade I wasn't one that took good care
of myself when I was younger I didn't
ever like I had a really really long
hair and I didn't brush my hair all the
way through I always had this big knot
in the back of my head like this big mat
and not my mother never made me brush it
out and we sat there at my birthday's in
June is the end of the school year it
was the summer but the summer between
fifth and sixth grade and she brushed my
hair out for me and she did my hair and
she put a little makeup on me and I
never I that was the first time I
remember thinking that I was pretty in
any way I never thought that I had any
kind of prettiness to me and I just you
know didn't have self-confidence in that
way I was always really self-conscious
and very over compensating for being
self-conscious and I should Nora looking
at myself and going like oh my gosh you
know so that was a really good memory
too I just remind ya but I get a little
choked up thinking about it because it
really meant a lot to me I only remember
what her name was
I think that she ended up leaving after
that year like we all went to sixth
grade I don't think I ever saw her again
after that
