the makeup chat it's so good to be here
um oh my gosh what what a day what a day
but we're not gonna dwell on my evening
that was my well my sleep time last
night which was virtually non-existent
but we're gonna focus on the chat for
today which is the old school beauty
tags today we're gonna do two tags that
I did before years ago so the first one
is the 20 beauty questions tagged I did
it February 9th of 2014 it currently has
two thousand nine hundred sixty views
which is a lot of views for my channel
back then and then we're gonna do the
eye part fall tag I did that one in
November 18th of 2012 and that has 272
news right now which is about right for
what I was getting back then I just felt
it probably had like 150 when it first
went live so yeah I did it a really long
time ago
when I had a baby youtube channel you
know just a little channel and I still
loved it I loved it just as much then
and I love my subscribers just as much
then as I do now but I feel like my
channels come a long way since since the
quality of those they're not good but
anyway if you're wondering where what's
up in makeup is if you're watching this
live it is still processing it is done
being uploaded it says 16 minutes
remaining for processing so it should be
up very soon it was quite an ordeal I
went over it on snapchat I put it on
Twitter and I put on Instagram what
happened and why the show it's live but
just know I did everything I could to
try to get it up on time today and
YouTube is not my friend right now so
anyway we're gonna go ahead and get into
the tags I'm gonna go at it real quick
and say hello to the collective brain of
makeup awesomeness also known as the
people who are here in the live chat
we're gonna answer these questions
together which i think is so much more
fun than just me answering them on my
own
cuz then we get all these interesting
you know all this interesting
perspective and I love it actually love
it because we're all one here like I was
saying in my last video we're all one
we're all the collective and we're all
equally as
awesome and important in this realm so I
want to hear what you all have to say if
you're watching this on the replay
definitely make sure you leave any
answers that you would like in the
comments down below if you'd like to
leave lots of comments that always
helped me in the YouTube algorithm so
you can feel free to do that if you like
as far as answering these questions or
you can compile them all into one
comment if whatever makes you happy so
I'm gonna go ahead and say hello to the
people that are live I'm scrolling all
the way to the top so amber is here and
Nadine is here thank you buck second mic

Tabitha says on the balcony with my

Nancy is here good morning my friend oh
my goodness it like skipped all the way
down to the bottom so if I didn't say
look to you hello to you and welcome
this morning I'm so happy to have you
here alright um let's see if I can turn
off some of these crazy little
notification things so I can get the
chat up higher there we go okay yeah so
let's go ahead and get started so the
twenty Beauty question is tagged there's
a bunch of these out there there's a
forty Beauty questions tag we get a
thirty PD questions tag last week but
they're all just a little bit different
and they have some really great
questions so alright number one what is
the one product you grab if your house
is on fire and I did mention this last
week and it's definitely going to be
something
limited-edition something that I can't
ever get again and of course it seems
you can predict what I'm gonna say
the Alice Through the Looking Glass
palette is what I would grab because
this is the most beautiful palette that
I own and I love the colors it's fun I
love playing with this pilot whenever I
get the opportunity to and I would
definitely grab this yeah so it's got
these cute little flaps I showed this
last week because I would grab this not
because it's my favorite palette to use
overall but just because I can't ever
get it again I think it's absolutely
beautiful I like my little collection I
have a little collection of like
storybook looking eyeshadow palettes so
like I've got the lorac Pirates of the
Caribbean that would be a hard one to
not leave the house without I probably
wouldn't grab eyeshadow to be honest
with me focus leaping the house now is
on fire I grabbed my pets and my
children but if I was gonna grab
something and I grabbed my wedding album
and things like that but but yeah the
Alice of living that's about the lorac
Pirates of the Caribbean palette and be
eating the Beast by lorac those I really
love a lot that I'm not gonna be able to
buy again
Elijah says a Little Mermaid palette a
little mer I've seen a few Little
Mermaid counts which one are you talking
about Carla is here good morning she
says I would grab my foundations it
takes way too long to find perfect
matches yeah I hear you Carla I'm very
thankful that I don't have that problem
I know you do and I definitely feel for
people that have to deal with that so
I'm here yeah I hear you
iris said embarrassingly I've got my
Jaclyn help how it also Mario and visi
art college yeah I mean that Jacqueline
the pound is good it's a good palette I
don't blame you I'm not gonna hate on
you for that
kate says her motive palette yeah that's
why I'm wondering the little mermaid
palette by to do I know that there's
there's a couple mermaid palettes that
came out
Georgia said I would grab my pets
passport and busy art nice Lauren says
the apology definitely I've worked on
them area Carrie says they're honest
Asya Modern Renaissance McKenna says her
cat mangy metal Matt I have a sad story
about my metal Matt I think my metal
Matt was stolen we have some people we
had some people over a house that he
didn't know very well and I think
that and I showed them my makeup room
and I think that one of them stole my
Kat Von D metal not because I haven't
been able to find it in months like you
notice when I've done videos and things
that it hasn't been in my videos like
for two videos and stuff because I can't
find it and that finished gigantic like
how did you lose the Kat Von D metal mat
you just don't lose it that's why I
think somebody stole it and I'm like so
if I ever find it I would probably cry
for happiness but I think one of them
came in home storming palette so you
know it is what it is that's the risk
you take when you invite people into
your house that you don't know very well
but anyway you know it is what it is I'm
kind of over it I know but nothing else
seems to be gone it's just that one
thing that I can't find but it was like
not too long after I reviewed it it was
like a month or two after we reviewed it
so I don't know but anyway I'm gonna go
ahead move on to the next question
number two which beauty blogger would
you want to do your makeover you know I
didn't give this one a whole lot of
thought before
um Beauty walk I wanted to my makeover
probably raw Beauty Christie because she
is sickeningly talented she's ridiculous
at how talented she is so probably Rob
you - Christie either Robbie to Christie
or only Noel pretty much I think I said
in the original big guy to the things I
know right um I don't know where she was
well I mean I don't know I don't know
and that's the only thing I can think of
is that somebody stole it because it's
gigantic
I don't know where I could have put that
I haven't found it at this point you
know what I mean so I don't know you
know talk to you a lot of people saying
totty totty Rosita Applebaum Lisa
Eldridge yes Christie Emily Noel Patrick
Starr vintage or tacky
um can I just say that I love you and
can I just say that I love you are
willing to chat first thing in Sunday
morning this is the best time for me to
do it so I'm happy to be here Wayne Goss
Emily Noelle Wayne JB page
Tati Emily no
all talking Stephanie Nicole or Emily
Noel Irwin Gus Emily no well Jim who 89
kimberly-clark
oh that would be amazing I would love a
dragon egg over if I can go to Clark I
know it takes her forever to do drag
makeup though so I would feel bad asking
you to do it for me Rach loves makeup
she'll learn nikkietutorials
yes christy is a good pic I love Alex
and Jordan yes no I wish did more videos
is Alex faction I feel like he doesn't
put up enough content like he'll it
kills it for Halloween and like the rest
of you just chills the channel you know
me like comes on and just smacks this
channel with like amazing Halloween
stuff and then it's done so I'm excited
to see Alex back and come back full
force but anyway let's go ahead and go
to the next question what's the lab do
people think you look like I get Selena
Gomez the most I get that one the most
about I I see it a little bit but that's
when I get the most I get everyone small
Wednesday Addams I got that one recently
I get what's your name from Seinfeld I
get told I sound like her we check from
Seinfeld I can't remember what her name
it's right off the top of my head Ellen
something or I can't remember it off my
head
but anyway so those are people mostly I
get Selena Gomez that's the big one and
the funny story about Selena Gomez I
think I've told you this before is that
my brother first saw her on Wizards of
Waverly Place he actually like either
called me or texted me or something and
was like oh my gosh there's this little
girl on the show and she looks exactly
like you
so I thought that was really funny like
she's like a little version of you now
Wednesday I was Elaine there you go a
little psycho
Julia Louie Dreyfus there you go I
couldn't remember it it was like out of
my head you gotta remember I'm working
on like like the most I got was like two
hours of consecutive sleep last night
so yeah Alex Jordan Christie they're
good friends - yes they are they are yes
Julia Louie Dreyfus yes exactly
Annette Bening nice the woman from Top
Gun you people are saying who they look
like iris says Lucy Liu Kimberly says
khloe kardashian allah who aren't you
lucky
Amy says the prince

yay finally made some flag chat yeah
happy to have you here I see Brandis
comments all the time
Nadine says she gets to bear and more
and Natalie Wood and um let's say Kerry
says Casey Holmes interesting who look
like Casey Holmes or you would want
Casey wants to do your makeup Lauren
says I never look like anybody I'm
everything original oh there you go good
for you I love that all right so let me
go to the next one
Oh r1 says once she gets Lindsay Lohan a
lot okay let's go to number four what
beauty products you save for date night
usually lashes I don't wear lashes
except for the film of the date night
and red lipstick I love wearing red
lipstick on a date I thought it looks
really sexy for a date you know unlike
vampy lipsticks red lipsticks and things
I love that for a date night but that's
pretty much it and I do want filming
style makeup from date night we're on
like the day to day I don't wear that
much Christina Ricci that's another one
I get every once in a while I used to
get more lines younger though Lynn says
lashes latina says perfume Christina

Lizzy says yeah I made it yeah you're
here Arwen says some lashes Kerry says
wednesday addams no um Pam says lip balm
only says you red lipstick you so hot
dark lipstick red lipstick nice
Christina says lashes glitter and liquid
lipstick nice alright next one is number
five which of your guy friends takes
longer than you to get ready I don't
have guy friends I can't think of a
single guy friend that I have because I
think once you get married you kind of
have less guy friends overall unless you
stay friends with somebody that you were
friends with or unless you work in a
work place where there's lots of guys
there where you get to be friends with
people like I worked as a teacher so
there were like two guys in my both
school and one of them was married to
one of the other teachers
so it was like you know they were like
you know like this like two peas in a
pod that was closer with her than I was
with him and then the other guy was the
gym teacher who was awesome and I loved
him to death but we weren't like friends
or anything you know what I mean oh the
speech pathologist cuz God - he was
really nice but they're like they're not
getting they're not the kind that get
ready like and I was going that close
with them either so I don't have any my
husband doesn't take that long to get
ready who used to there was a while
where he was taking a little while to
get ready but he goes to phases and now
he just puts little product in his hair
and shames and he's done so nobody
Elisha says one of my husband's friends
spends hours on his hair Oh Julie says
did what something makes the makeup get
posted today oh why minute did he just
put out hold on a second cuz it looks
like it cut out on me but it looks like
it's still working for you it's so weird
okay it's still crossing what's it
what's a good makeup is still
prosthetics that's four minutes left for
processing for what's a good makeup okay
I feel like scared to keep going because
I'm scared because Mike my feed cut out
so I don't know if it's still working
for everyone else
I'm waiting because there's okay but you
guys can still see me I can't see myself
at all it's all fuzzy so you guys just
have to tell me if I got a booger
sticking on my nose or something he
doesn't have to tell me okay cool
all right um what was it talking about
so yeah so no guy friends things four
main frozen Jemma says Amy says her food
cut out okay I'm gonna keep going
because it says that it's playing even
though I can't see myself so if you
can't see me go out and come back that's
probably Tabitha okay all right it is
okay good I'm just gonna keep going
sorry if you're watching this on the
replay continue alright now we've got if
you could create your own miracle beauty
product what would it be it would be a
beauty product that would remove
just automatically within you know a few
uses would just tighten your skin up
without looking crazy without looking
fake you'd be like a targeted miracle
wrinkle cream that would be amazing I
would love that I think this person is
in I'm gonna put on my timeout they make
that person is what was happening okay
anyway sorry I don't know this is hello
okay all right sorry okay I'm back sorry
about that it was a I just nobody never
calls me
so if someone calls me then it's
probably an emergency so it was a
reminder of an appointment that I had so
anyway yeah okay so let's look up
everybody saying I'm so sorry cuz I'm so
off today all right Katie says yes
remove wrinkles and pores Tammy says yes
they remove wrinkles and tighten the
face Holly says wrinkle eraser permanent
yes love it you have to repurchase it
Debbie says a product that gets rid of
dark circles and Elijah says lift the
skin the eye skin our miracle acne
treatment yes we'll buy that product big
big time gasps because what I'm learning
is really there's no product that's
gonna like really and truly like reverse
aging it just doesn't there just isn't
it doesn't exist you know you can kind
of slow down the process you can do some
temporary stuff where you can go get
things done but honestly like the more I
see people who are getting things done
the less I like the way it looks you
know for a while I was kind of feeding
into the whole like getting things done
thing like thinking about getting Botox
and stuff like that and then I started
really looking at the people who have
had those procedures and I don't think I
enjoy the way that that looks because I
don't feel like it looks natural you
know what I mean like it doesn't look
the same as it did when we were 20 so it
just if I don't know I don't I don't
like it so I don't think I'm going to do
that so anyway
so that will be my miracle beauty
product would be something that looks
natural and this is like over an eraser
just for right here just right there but
if I got rid of them then what would I
review is for skincare you know anything
chemist said the cream it kills scars
there you go
I've heard of some ones that worked
really well yeah I don't know I don't
know what was the one that my daughter
used weren't really washing with a scar
on the neck well if I find out what it
is I'll let you know I know how to find
you I'll find you and figure it out I
think it's in the other room bio oil
that was what it's called bio oil if you
don't know what it is that's age with
grace we go but I have no judgment
toward everybody that wants to get
plastic surgery to look like that that
is your face that is not my face that is
your face and do what you want with your
face I'm just talking about what I would
do with my face
everyone says I get fillers - I can't
help it we do that you got to do what
you want if you enjoy and you do it and
you know I've never seen your face so
you love it that's what it's all about
mmm okay so anyway uh let's go ahead and
go on to the next question and the thing
is - one other thing about the plastic
surgery thing is people are always
shared that they've had procedures done
so I may just be judging the people like
the way that people look like based on
what I would want I may be looking at
them because I know that they've had it
done and maybe people that have had it
done that look more natural and I have
no idea that they've had it done you
know what I mean so you know there's
that side of it - all right next
question what is your best beauty tip my
best beauty tip is take your time I
think that when people are starting out
with makeup I think sometimes at least I
know I was very impatient to put on
makeup where I just wanted to go on and
I want it to be good and I wanted to be
able to do it quickly and I want to be
able to do easily and
it's awesome and I feel like I was
always rushing it and that was part of
the reason why it never came out as good
as I wanted to and I feel like things
have gotten a lot better with my makeup
lately because I've been doing more to
take my time to pay attention to the
details of it so that would be my advice
is don't rush it don't stress out about
it and if you want and a great time to
practice is when you would normally be
sitting in front of TV watching TV or
you know put your laptop with you know
something on in your by your makeup
where you're getting ready or listen to
a podcast or something and just play
with makeup you know when you're not
playing on going anywhere and just have
fun you know even if you're just playing
with your eyeshadow a triangle winged
liner for the first time you know you
don't have to just do makeup in order to
go out if you want to get better at it
no just play and have fun and and when
you're when you're really trying to make
it look good take your time with it
Katie says take care of your skin I feel
like I'm late to the skincare party I'm
trying to reserve the first years of
damage
yes hydrate just says McKenna says
sunscreen Olivia says yeah I always take
my time when I do my makeup I didn't
always and that's why I'm speaking from
that perspective cuz I definitely didn't
always suck boy McCoy is back this week
I think my makeup looks best when I wear
very light foundation it looks so much
more natural yeah I totally agree
absolutely maybe because I wish I had
more time I wish I could sit in the band
instead of over bathroom sink I was over
the bathroom sink for years for years so
I totally know you know with the makeup
bag underneath the sink and you got
everything like what I would do is I
take a towel and I would lay it out in
my sink and then I would dump all my
beauty products at mistake and then like
be all up in the mirror like I totally
with you totally with you moisturizing
Naza says absolutely Jackie says don't
don't just say no try things before you
say it's not for you yes exactly I feel
like that's something that people people
will watch you're youtubers or adult
leave reviews and things in the
automatic would be like nope it's the
terrible product without even trying I
think that's really important too
before you say something's terrible to
try and you can't try everything
obviously but say I heard that it was
terrible but I mean people are very
judgy these days I feel you know
Mercedes says she vanities at Walmart or
Big Lots that's true if you have room in
your house for it because my problem is
my house is an apartment that I lived in
what you small for me to have a band so
that was that was always my issue nikki
says don't sleep in makeup
very good advice all right next one
number eight what beauty products do you
love to splurge on my big thing I think
we talked about this last week was
eyeshadow and I think we did this one
last week so I'm gonna skip through that
one
but eyeshadow is my big thing that I
love to splurge on number nine which
beauty bloggers would you bring on a
shopping spree oh my gosh which beauty

the rat bath time let me sing
our little song and everything I've got
I don't know maybe 70 of these things
but I've got all these scent Birds we
don't know separate it's a subscription
service that I did a sponsored sponsored
me no nothing it was sponsored I think
it was an unsurveyed sent me a bag to
review or something like that I don't
think he was sponsored or not now but
anyway point is they sent me you know
one to review and I signed up for a
subscription because of that and then if
you get a referral then you get a free
month well I've got like you know a
lifetime supply of scent bird coming at

this is a really good one this one I
would say is close to a signature scent
this is Juicy Couture's Viva La Juicy
gold Couture I like this one the best
other than Ebola juicies other than
Juicy Couture ones I should say you see
any of these other ones in here that are
really good
none of these are like my favorites
here's more this is Viva La Juicy and
Viva La Juicy Lafleur I like Lafleur
better than the original this is another
one I really like this is Taylor Swift
wonderstruck
I don't really have like a signature
scent
I do like fruity florals or my favorites
but
so many of these same things and like I
need to start wearing for a few more
often even if I'm not going anywhere
because what am I ever going to use all
these I need to just like invite friends
over and just have them just grab stuff

get a whole wearing that one to work
thing AJ says Gucci Guilty that's
another deep one I heard about that one
from oh now I can't my border name is
Liz Lizzy what would Lizzy do was where
I heard about that one the first time
she was raving about it but she no fresh
summer says of muskie no mosquito fresh
that's the one that looks like a UH like
a Windex bottle which is so funny
okay I love that packaging scenarios but
ya know signature scent for me okay now
we need to go to number 11 because we
are already 30 minutes in or only
halfway through the first tag number 11
I am on an endless quest for the perfect
I think cuz I found a couple of things
that are pretty perfect my mascara but
I'm never gonna fund it and I've given
up because I'm never gonna find a
mascara that you learn things in volume
I see the way I wanted to it's never
gonna happen I give it up I think we
talked about that last week too so let's
go to the next one how many beauty
products does it take you to get ready
face primer foundation concealer setting
powder eye primer eyeshadow I'm just
gonna say eye shadow as one even though
there would be multiple eyeshadows
involved eyeliner mascara blush
highlighter contour Senate will say
mascara did that's it so 11 I guess if I
say foundation they skip foundation I
hope I said foundation I don't usually
do like a setting powder or setting
spray or something so that's 11 11 ish
somewhere in there right Fox's den says
about 12 and says brow pen mascara and
lipstick that's it nice Holly says
cruelty free for feet free perfume there
you go
amber says like 20 too many own are we
good OMG i just kind of it 24 I know
oh my gosh yup yup lip product that's it
brows I forgot brows and bronzer I don't
use bronzer for brows I always forget
brows that's 12 but sometimes I'll use
two or three products on my brows you
know especially since I feel like my
brow hairs are starting to go a little
wild I looked at my brother like if I
got together with my brother the day and
his brow hairs or starting the leg shoot
off a little bit as five years older
than me it's like up that's the way my
brows are going I'm gonna start shooting
off all the few directions but that
could excuse me oh and lipstick so
that's 13 I'm usually use more than one
lipstick though usually you usually use
a lighter in a darker one cuz I love the
ombre thing that's fun
natural around pre-vet says no we're not
counting skincare no just makeup county
skincare that's a whole nother thing
that's a whole
it's because it does say beauty products
doesn't it it does say beauty product so
in the morning and use my solar water to
clean my face and then I use a
moisturizer usually that's that's what
I've been doing lately is just my slow
water and moisturizer so it's just adds
to for me my evening routine is much
more complicated let's see 13 what
lipstick lip gloss is in your purse
right now I don't have a lipstick or lip
gloss on my purse what I just have like
a random lip balm there's always random
lip balms I think I have them it was
like a duo thing that was like a clique
thing that I got at generation beauty in
either San Francisco or Los Angeles it
was like a duo clicky thingy and there's
a vanilla and an orange and I think I've
got that in my first but I can't
remember what brand it is I don't know
but it's just a random lip balm suck boy
McCoy says sunscreen young lady oh I've
been really bad about my sunscreen
recently I have to admit I'm gonna be
honest with you I've been really bad
about it and I think part of it is
because most days I'm spending the day
in the house I don't spend a lot of time
outside so it's not part of my routine
but when I know I'm gonna go outside I
will do that but I honestly I've been
spending a lot of time inside to be
honest with you you know but I won't put
on sunscreen if I know all I'm gonna do
is be driving my sons and his you know
karate class or whatever the I just call
it a karate class not quite class but
like his thing he goes to I'm like going
in and coming out like I won't put
sunscreen on so that's just me though is
that bad I don't think that's bad I'm
not gonna be out in the Sun
cos grapefruit with SPF nice we've gone
back to the lip question truly lovely
says Tati lipstick in my purse it's so
natural I mean nice I still have those
they're all sitting in a drawer I
haven't even used those in like a year
that talked to the specs the ones that
you can't leverage with Birchbox I
haven't used them I don't know why
they're all sitting in a drawer and into
music one alright so Oh Tammy says tart
and Matt rose nice Thomas says what is
outside it's that thing you know where
your driveway is
wait.you tomato play inside all right
now moving on we're gonna go to the next
one because we're like getting low on
time already 14 who is your celebrity
Duty icon I think we talked about this
some last week I don't only keep up with
like celebrity news stuff but if I had
to pick someone it's probably the same
one I think I said then which is
Jennifer Lopez I just got this thing
with Jennifer Lopez but I just adore her
and I've got this like deep love for her
I don't know what it is like this like
deep like I want her to be my best
friend and in my mind I think she is my
best friend like I think she knows me
and I I have like this whole like heart
for Jennifer Lopez I don't know what it
is I just I think she's amazing
if you don't think Jennifer Lopez is
amazing you need to watch the carpool
karaoke with Jennifer Lopez oh my gosh
you'll die you'll die she's amazing I
love all right we gotta keep going 50
name the beauty brand you most loved to
be a spokesperson for this one I really
want to hear from the collective brain
on most look at the PA spokesperson for
our unfortunately brands that I don't
think whatever happen he has a
spokesperson I don't know I mean I guess
it's possible but like Julius place I
love but there are black beauty brands
so it's like I feel like they kind of
have a duty to use black women and their
as their spokespeople you know like I
feel like that's kind of their thing so
I don't think using a white woman would
be necessarily the right move for them
but I mean and I I think that it will
you I don't know I just don't think that
they would want to use me as a
spokesperson but I love them so much
like to my core I love Judy's place
products that I have so I would love
that but I don't think that's ever gonna
happen let's see who else like
mainstream brands I think I had said to
face back in the day but I don't know
about Too Faced now I'm not sure about
that I don't know I started to like NYX
a little bit more I'm starting to get
I'm sorry to get more NYX I found their
quality going up quite a bit I hadn't
tried a lot of NYX they sent me a box of
PR stuff and I recently got a chance to
try some of their newer stuff and said
why all this stuff has really come a
long way
know who else yeah I don't know I mean I
feel like that there's so the ball there
you go Christine I guess the ball
absolutely the bomb would be a good one
that would be I think we'd be a pretty
good fit I don't have that retro look
though so I don't know urban decay oh my
gosh that's another person that I love I
love
what's your name the spokesperson for
Urban Decay Ruby Rose I just think she's
beautiful I think she's gorgeous I love
her that's more about I think she's
absolutely beautiful
let me see what other people are saying
sorry I just wasn't rigging on my left
uh AJ says NYX eye makeup is so fun kg
says Nixon answer says drunk elephant
nice and even think about skincare
brands Amy says makeup geek that would
be a good one too yes that would be
create Nicole says I loved you this
place - thanks to you and Stephanie
Nicole oh it's so good that says it
cosmetics Holly says by CUNY and lorac
by eating would be a good one lorac
would be a good one those are great
ideas are what suspense EBD
nice I'm curious to see that stuff
coming out I don't think I'm gonna buy
any of it at least with the start maybe
let their second release that would get
something but and I think I'm gonna pass
on the hype of 50 in the beginning I
already see all like the major youtubers
are tweeting about it and stuff I think
I'm gonna let it pass for the first well
Elijah says covergirl Julie says Tarte
meaning says NYX Billy says it cosmetics
are Too Faced
makeup Emma says I'd love to face most
my palettes most of my palette from Too
Faced Christina says urban decay maybe
even says the bone yeah there you go
alright next one oh my gosh I love
talking about this stuff I don't wanna
have to rush through what is your
current nail polish my current nail
polish is beat up like beat up so bad
and actually someone had told me they
said are you wearing so-and-so by Essie
on your nails and I think they were
right this is called nothing else metals
by Essie I got this a few years ago and
I love it for initial application but it
it starts like kind of rubbing away over
the Pat over like the first like a
couple of days it reminds me a lot of
Kathleen
that's what she said where it's it's
that metallic so it just kind of rubs
off pretty quickly but it's gorgeous to
go on it just lasts empowers not
fantastic and then on this nail it's a
great nail polish this is by a brand
called Nick okay New York or nicka K and
this is their silver glitter this stuff
is so cake look at it I've had this for
years so it's getting a little gloppy it
wasn't the fluffy before it's certain
though like thicken up but I'm still
going to use it because it is amazing
look thick that is it's getting old I
can't part with it because it's so good
like it just checked yesterday it's been
on for a week there you go there's a
good shot of it but oh my gosh
love those who guys know I love my nail
polishes but this is coming off today Oh
like I might put on my phone nail
polishes that I'm going to show you in a
second what are you guys wearing uh MB
case he says I'm wearing K L polish from
kathleenlights nice I love Mike al
polishes I do people said I was too
tough on them in my review but I think
people just expected I could thin it out
summer I think people just expected me
to leave about it without any criticism
but I didn't I mean I was honest I was
honest you know but yeah
Pamela says get the or leak thinner it
works great okay I will coffee girl 19
says jamberry obsessed with raps
I did do rapped I went through a period
of time where I did the nail wraps and I
really loved them and then I got rid of
my scratch subscription I kept my ring
though this ring that I wear all the
time I don't even take the spring off
it's my Gemini ring I bought this in a
scratch subscription it's a nail wrap
subscription they used to send to me for
review but I hated the design so much
they sense to me because I kept saying
oh my gosh this is on its own that is
not for me this design is not gonna
decide that for me so eventually they
just stopped sending them new he says
Jen um you should do a nail polish video
well I do do some they they're not real
popular the nail polish videos that I do
but I shouldn't I - videos aren't
popular all the time so questions your
nail polish video whenever I get nail
polish that I feel like people won't
care about what I did with the
kathleenlights collection I will all do
money I'll polish videos
Alejandro says China Glaze high school
colors that's true that's true Jenny T
says I got some rats from jamberry I
will go through them in about 15 years I
actually got this let me show you this
my friend Jennifer who makes YouTube
videos
she arm sent this to me and I haven't
made a video about yet but I want to she
has her website is www.hs jen and it's
called color street and they're like
jammer at very narrow nail wraps it
aren't these beautiful
I haven't used them yet though if your
soul wants to know if I have a nail
polish collection video that would take
forever
that would be what the hour long video
and I don't know if anybody would watch
the whole thing I wouldn't watch it if I
wouldn't watch that video I would not
enjoy that but yeah this looks really
cool it's one of those MLMs but I like
nail wrap so I told her that I would I
would try these and talk about them on
the channel at some point but I haven't
tried them yet
but they're just like jamberry they're
called color street and again her this
is not sponsored by the way it's my
college treat calm slash just Jen with
one end jus ta en if you're interested
in these I'll put the link in the video
description after after the video is
over but Randy says can you purchase the
kale polish in stores no it's a small
independent brand at this point so
they're just available online for polish
website well right uh next one let's
keep going
favorite mascara right now is the
essence lash princess is my favorite I
talk about this all the time and along
with the Jordana best flash extreme
those are my favorites there's a peach
one of this that I don't see a
difference between but a lot of people
do see the difference we see one that
says yeah and actually I like the warmer
on the peach one better because this
one's straight and that one's a little
more has a little more wave to it which
I like better but yeah I love the
essence mascaras Jenny T says they just
discovered Live Love Polish expensive
polishes but they're so beautiful and
great formulas yeah I really would love
to get any more indie brand polishes but
like
said they're so expensive so I mean you
get free polishes in your you're out
fifty bucks
you know sometimes Mimi says can't yell
in big trouble this weekend yeah she
made a mistake I shouldn't talk about
that though because it's not my business
you know what I mean like it's not it
wasn't it wasn't directed if you don't
know Kathleen likes had a little issue
this weekend's if you wanted to check it
out on the Twitter or Instagram I think
was on her snapchat - but it wasn't
directed toward me so like I don't know
I just I feel like it's not really mine
to talk about you know what I mean but
yeah I was that was kind of mass
yesterday mess yeah but anyway moving on
we're gonna do what the last thing you
bought at Sephora I made a huge support
or order with the last of the super chat
money of the two-faced sweet peach
collection I got a ton of stuff from
that collection I use up the rest of the
super chat money so we're gonna be
reopening super chat soon and we'll get
into that and why I'm doing super chat
and everything when I reopen it and make
sure that it's clear that you guys know
that I can buy products without
donations and all of that we get into
all that then but but yes I bought that
was less than I got Sephora was I well I
didn't buy the whole collection because
that's ridiculous it's a large sum you
know it's hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of dollars to buy the whole
collection but I did yeah Shia Shan says
yeah this is back to the PI thing like
think she says I thought you have to
look at the context the word that said
it and I agree with you I do I think
that does make a difference to some
people but I'm not going to tell people
how to feel about it I feel like it
makes the difference to me but again are
not the group targeted with it so I
don't feel like I can like but I do
think context matters and I think people
should take that into consideration and
then when they take it into
consideration they have a right to feel
the way that they want to feel about it
sorry I know I'm speaking in code if you
don't know what happens I'm sorry I'm
speaking in code I just don't want to
get into it too deep
but yes that's what the last thing I got
it Sephora number 19 I try never to be
seen without wearing shirt uh I don't
like a jeans I don't like my leg showing
I have varicose veins on my legs and I
don't like them they make me feel yucky
so I wear pants all the time like you'll
very rarely see me any kind of skirt or
dress unless it's wrong
it's like I'm not a big fan of my legs I
used to have really nice legs when I was
in my early 20s really nice legs I have
to say I just had a really nice body
overall except for I didn't have the
biggest up top going on but I had a
really nice body overall and you know I
should get older things change a bit so
but as far as makeup goes I don't I mean
you can see I don't care about wearing
makeup in public I don't care
you know clothes are important I don't
feel comfortable without clothes some
people are very comfortable without
clothes but I'm not that's just me Annie
says she got the Lancome adul foundation
oh you have to tell me how it is
what Tati says she loves it so I'm
curious to see what you think of it and
make sure you let me know Carrie says
she can't be that old I'm 39 39 I can't
believe it some days you can't possibly
be 39 good Meghan says kids destroy your
body up and they steal your brain that's
another thing I have I have a theory
that when your child is incubating in
your belly that they suck all your brain
cells like all your brain power goes to
that because I feel like pregnancy may
be really sweet like stupider like I
lost some of my ability to connect ideas
whose teen says I doubt stephanie nicole
will reveal the peach will review the
peach matte palette so now I'm counting
on you to tell me if I can pass yeah I
don't know if suck me whether or not I'm
not trying to talk to you about it but
um now Julie says just get them removed
I hate you no honestly I don't care
enough about it to get it removed I
rather just wear pads trooper and they
don't cause me pain if they ever cause
me pain I would
Coffee girl says you look done thank you
thank you so much I appreciate it
like I says I'm 30 90 people never
believed me yeah I know yeah it's nice
though it's nice that yeah thank you I
appreciate that
but anyway let's go into the last one
because we have 15 minutes and we have a
whole nother tag to do we have the I
hurt bolt I can do what's one beauty
product you'd always recommend and what
did I have for this one I pulled
something out to this beauty products
are always recommend what oh I already
talked about jeebies place our shadow
palettes these have been so consistently
good they're so consistent and good I
mean let me let me do a couple of
swatches for you let's do some more
blood quote wearable colors we'll do
some of these in here if you like
metallics and foils and things like that
their mats are really good too but I
feel like they're standout in their
metallics and their foils there's a
satin that i swatched too so there's
three metallics and then this one's more
of a satin finish here but they're just
amazing there's so amazing steps that
shape take that's a good one Lauren says
lorac pro palette that's a good one
Oh beauty song says I know I look
gorgeous thank you I feel like 39th not
all that old though but at the same time
it's like - pass and time is passing Oh
Becky's going to church have a great day

me that um that I need to try it oh my
gosh what sipping makeup still isn't
done it says 95% processing really are

I can't believe that that is
unbelievable okay so yes Julia's place
eyeshadow palettes everybody staying
busy are lots of busy arts Michelle says
busy art from Matt's ingenious with
shimmer yes mm-hmm
Judy's blushes are great nemesis says
yes but I don't feel like the Judy is
the Judy's place blushes are great but I
feel like I have other stuff that's
equally as good I'm art one says Natasha
to know in the shadows yes they are very
good but I
honestly I left my GPS place just as
much as been in touch with you don't no

off sales on that website also the
Sephora when you have the big sale

news beauty thank you guys so much but
I'd appreciate Tabitha got it to news
beauty thank you so much my friends yep
you're all jumping in with it the enemy
says not eyeshadows are bomb yes they
are very very good okay I hurt fall tag
so there's only ten questions the I
might fall tag and we've got ten minutes
can we do it
can we do it number one favorite fall
lip product of course I lost it sorry
lack of sleep these are the ones I'm
gravitating toward recently the
bareMinerals gen news this is XYZ I'm
starting to like I don't know if you've
noticed recently in my videos but I've
started to kind of go to more toward
like the peachy orange e Rouge I don't
know why I've been gravitating toward
that so XYZ is like a peachy nude you
can see that that was a terrible place
to swatch that was a stupid idea and
then this one by ghost of colors this
one is moon deeds this is a darker one
let me put it somewhere else this is a
darker one they said that it kind of
matches my shirt but like the deep
berries and the deep peaches and things
like that or my favorite colors will
fall so these are two recommendations I
love these formulas if you want
something a little longer lasting but a
little bit less comfortable though for
the dose of colors if you want something
a lot more comfortable but not as
long-lasting go for the bare minerals
these two formulas are my favorites oh I
also brought out
weekends this
a little even a little bit later this is
their minerals weekend this is more of a
good peach break Fox's den says reds and
browns Emily says NARS power power mat
in slow ride never tried those the
knowledge power mats Christina says Bare
Minerals scandal and Urban Decay's 1993
I wish I'd grabbed not 293 I had it and
then I didn't I didn't end up keeping it
but I wish I'd packed it now
Nadine says to face look creme and pink
chocolate yes oh my gosh and love that
one that one's an amazing velvet teddy
Michelle says yep there you go okay next
one favorite fall nail polish for fall I
really have been digging doing like
metallic browns so these are two of my
favorites this is rage by orderly it's
like this beautiful metallic like pinky
light pink beige II kind of color and
then this is a really good one this is
by julep and this is called dawn now
Lupe says how do you respond to
someone's comments are you talking about
Lupe I'm talking about my friend I'm
trying to did I miss one of your
comments my friends I hope I didn't
season says I know I missed it this
morning it's okay Stacy are here now Amy
speciality navy blue but this one's
really beautiful it's like a um the
julep glitters I really like because
they're opaque glitters they go on and
one to two coats to full opacity and
that's why I really really like them
barred lover says Kathleen likes brick I
don't own that one but that one looks
really cool Michelle says black of
course of course
manche me says dark purple Beth says
great too now I gravitate toward these
like baby
glittery kinds of things in the fall I
don't know what it is Courtney says
China glazes red ruby slippers
ooh that's a classic as a classic
Michelle says do you like job I feel
like there isn't much about them I love
trivia julep is one of the most
underrated brands for makeup for skin
wanna for skincare because I haven't
really dug into their skincare some
Marcus a skincare and their polishes but
the best way to get juleps stuff is to
sign up for their maybe even program
because you get stuff way cheaper like
I'm talking like half or less than half
price to sign up for the julep maven
program that is the best way to try
there
stuff because the polishes on their
owner like 14 bucks but you can get
mystery bags like $30 or 30 $35 mystery
bags where you'll get like well over
$100 in products including a bunch of
polishes and that's a great way to try
to look it is my favorite nail polish
brand I think I'm gonna have to
unsubscribe so you know because it's
getting ridiculous and I don't need it
to be honest
set point McCoy says Oh Jen do a big
julep review a super chat it's so hard
to be like there's a lot of I don't even
know which ones are available now oh you
know I could probably do like a jewel a
brand review one might be a good idea I
don't know what super check I wouldn't
need to do it with super chat because I
already own every like I don't need any
money for it but I could do like a live
chat maybe I could you look brand with
you I don't know I mean they're so
underrated there's so much good stuff
control I just got there concealer I
haven't tried it on my eyes yet but it
could look like on my wrist and like
cover it up my veins in my restaurants
okay oh my gosh it's those amazing so I
could try it more but it's really good
all right Jen shut up shut up yet okay
number three favorite Starbucks fall
shrink I'm a PSL girl I do like me some
pumpkin spice lattes but I'll drink
whatever like I go in and I kind of mix
it up depending on what they have I'm
not picky I'm not one that lets to stick
with one thing I like to just you know
go in and see what they have and then
pick something there I'm not one that
like I'm a pumpkin spice loyal person
but I do get a pumpkin spice lots and
every once in a while I have to admit
Tatiana says have you ever tried fun
laughter no I don't know fun lacquer
Steph says Essie style cartel is my
favorite nail polish off to check that
out Holly says chai latte I've never
tried one of those Christine says none
of my wild wild girl you know I also
like I'm Dunkin Donuts coffee if I don't
lie sugar in there like flavored coffees
though like I feel like even more than
Starbucks if you can't take the coffee
off so I'm Tim Burton ginger says we
have a tea important I've ever been in
one but we have one not that far away
but I've never been in one
all right next up favorite fall candle
I'm not a huge fan of person but I do
love those
and I'm having specific but I do really
like false sense you know that happens
sense and the pumpkin cents and things
like that anything that smells like food
is like my thing like I love the ones
that smell like food that's definitely
yes Shannon says peppermint mocha or
can't wait for those for the holidays
when this one comes out you know in
November I think this one has come out
it needs as I love Dunkin Donuts iced
coffee yes the chats about 30 seconds
behind me that's why they're still
talking about coffee all right going to
number five favorite fall scarf or
accessory I don't really do that so I
don't really have an answer for that one
I don't really do scarves I'm not good
at accessorizing I'm not good at scarves
so that one I'm gonna have to skip
number six haunted house haunted hayride
or haunted format corn maze
I don't like haunted anything I mean I'm
a wimp I'm big wimp if I had to pick I
would probably say haunted hayride
because in the hayride you're like safe
from anything that might jump out and
scare you I'm not a big like movie
scared person um you may know this about
me I had an irrational fear of zombies
I've talked about this last Halloween
it's irrational and I know this but it
is a genuine phobia like a genuine fear
where if you mention zombies like right
now I have a mild level of anxiety just
thinking about it my daughter said the
other day she was like if I call this
banana a zombie would that bother you
and I said yes like how dumb is that how
dumb is that so
yeah I don't like scary things if
father's name I don't like just the
thought of a zombie like gives me some a
mild form of anxiety not like true
anxiety but it's it's it's it's a
serious fear oh no it's very Courtney
says I have an irrational and a rare and
rational fear of people in masks yeah
Steph says I'll say good John grabs his
shotgun thank you so much Sara says she
hates on these two Vaughn not alone so
no walking dead you know I had
nightmares about Shaun of the Dead for
months after I saw Shaun of the Dead
Shaun of the Dead the comedy movie
nightmares for months after that no more
favorite Halloween movie I'm gonna go
with hocus-pocus I'm a big hocus pocus
fan I love that movie there's so many
adult jokes in that movie that you don't
realize when you're watching it as a
child it's pretty funny it's pretty
funny like when they're talking to the
bus driver there's like they're like
trying to get on the boss there's thick
 it's very inappropriate and I had
no idea but yeah definitely some said
Jenna I have a massive phobia of snakes
I fainted thinking of them oh my gosh
yeah that's bad oh my gosh Olivia says
clowns I don't like clowns Nina says no
spiders ha ha girl says I can't watch
signs do their signs didn't bother me
that wouldn't bother me so much
yeah hocus-pocus is amazing monster
squad simply Emily says month respond
you've never seen monster squad from the
80s that is one of the best movies I
should make my kids watch Monster Squad
that is such a good movie oh my gosh
with like the black the vortex and
everything and they're like getting suck
it oh my gosh it's so good it's so good
yes but I like those light heart it's
their news I don't like real scary
movies okay looks like your video
favorite house favorite candy to eat on
Halloween you know it's really boring
but I love Tic Tacs
huge can't happen I love kick pads I
don't know why what it is it's them I
think it's the multiple textures
it's the smooth creamy with the crispy
it's like a thing I love to cats
it's weird I know I also like just plain
milk chocolate Hotel Transylvania the
introduces legend with Tom Cruise you
know I've never seen legend I don't if
I've ever seen it I mean I might have
seen parts of it I'm the better singer
thing Amy says chocolate with nuts or
coconut and April says day after
clearance candy there you go because
you're a smart one this game gourd
another candy corn from
and these MDK Spassky got it reached his
kickbacks - all right we've got two more
questions number nine what are you
dressing up for is Halloween I haven't
decided yet my daughter dictates what I
wear for Halloween she's a leader man
she dictates what I wear whatever she
wears is what I wear she likes me to
match her she would like the whole
family to match her but she usually just
gets me to do it so last year I was a
Greek goddess because that was what she
was really into I think this year she
wants to be a mermaid
so I will probably be some kind of
mermaid but she says she doesn't want me
to do her makeup which totally bums me
out I think I could do such a cool
makeup look on you she's it doesn't want
me to do it so and I saw probably in a
being some variation of a mummy if I
dress up at all this year we'll see I
don't know
I usually when I take my pick out
trick-or-treating I like to dress up
with them they think it's fun I think
it's fun so I went up to my kids school
last year in costume and my school that
I taught at it was huge for her parents
to dress up in costumes I was like one
of like for parents that had costumes
 my daughter's not my daughter my
son's holiday weight I felt like kind of
like an idiot because there weren't any
other parents dressed up like what is
wrong with you people are generally
Halloween scary look but I didn't care
you know I'm one of those where I'm like
well this kind of thinks that no one
else is dressed up but I you know I
wasn't like subconscious they're like oh
we're gonna to go over to Jake I weren't
like all day I was proud but I was
disappointing not everybody who's
dressed up that says Halloween is really
scary for me I've a severe nut allergy
oh sorry okay last one what is your
favorite thing about fall the smell of
fall is probably my favorite thing I
love the way it smells when the season
changes and you can tell that there's a
difference between the sense of summer
and the sense of fall that smell of the
leaves and the crispness of the air like
it just changes and I just love that
sense you know where you know things are
just transitioning I love it I love it I
love this thing fall so alright it is 11

say before I pop
