Liberty did a review of a bunch of the
new Knick stuff so I'm really excited to
show his to see his video I haven't
watched yet but I really want to watch
it all so I'm really excited about this
mix cream highlight contour thingy that
looks super cool I'm excited about that
hopefully doesn't have any shimmer in it
it might just be like the tubey thing it
has a little bit of shimmer and frost in
it it better not except of the highlight
cam but the contour next also nicks has
something called the lip hombre duo that
looks really cool show you what that
looks like I did that with my lips today
I did a little ombre action with my lips
with on my lips tonight I have grunge
from colour-pop and a little bit of
Angeles from ofra which I talked about
in my 2015 favorites video if you
haven't seen that yet you can click on
that through my channel I don't think
it's linked below but I did do that
little ombre thing it's really easy to
do it's so easy just go pop pop with a
lighter color and we meet me wrong
finger meet me meet me and it blends it
out really nicely and i really like it
away that it looks a lot so i'm excited
for some ombre lip products from mix
next Knicks product is the soft focus
primer looks super cool is in a pan form
interested in seeing how that is and
that's it for the nick stuff that oh yes
that I was super excited about I'm gonna
flip over to the collective brain see
what y'all are saying about this stuff
karen says she put on unicorn tears
again I'm glad you enjoyed it unicorn
tears is a new lipstick from to face
that I am in love with I did try it on
over Cronje I just wasn't feeling it
today so I didn't use it today I ended
up taking it off and putting brunch back
on but I do have a whole video on all
the new to
bass lip products not all of them but
some of the new to face products um on
my channel as well if you have not seen
that Rebecca says i bought the bare
minerals lip gloss set in the Urban
Decay liner said they're also on sale
also also picked up some new Nick stuff
very cool anic aayah says vice for sold
out on the sephora website she's about
to check out and found nothing oh that's
so horribly sad um rayon on Urban Decay
calm right now they have twenty percent
off of all of their sales stuff right
now also twenty percent report is still
working as of yesterday Maggie says so I
will definitely be checking that out
Lily's here hi Lily good to see ya
Melissa says that she just brought the
chocolate bar palette thanks to me I did
use the chocolate bar palette on my eyes
today and I really love the chocolate
bar palette oh my goodness if you don't
on the chocolate bar palette I really
feel like it's very rare that i will
recommend a palette to everyone the only
way i would not recommend it is if you
don't like the smell of chocolate then i
would say do not buy it because you
really can smell it at least for a
period of time I've heard that the smell
does fade over time but ya know Oh to
face calm has a lot of really good sales
too i miss the person who said it but
chief acecomm does have a lot of really
good sales right now on some of their
older stuff including the sugar pop
palette oh my goodness the sugar pop
palette is amazing also the mat I pal is
really good if you like Matt I looks
especially if you are of a certain age
if you are getting those some regular
wrinkly lids like I'm starting to get
those Matt I looks really do look
gorgeous and even on listen are not
wrinkly wrinkling you um you definitely
can use some mad eyes and it looks
gorgeous it looks so seamless and
flawless when you use all Matt looks so
definitely recommending that over on the
UM over on the Too Faced website Tabitha
says she's waiting for the peach one I
am with you girlfriend waiting for the
peach palette supposedly it does smell
like peaches I was actually just talking
to my sister-in-law last night about the
peach palette and we're both super
excited about it so happy to see you
here Kyle oh very happy to see you here
Connie says i just bought the chocolate
bon bons palette very excited about that
taylor says Jen you're absolutely
gorgeous love you right here thank you
so much about to get it redone excited
about that and the beauty haul for one
Beth says that definitely don't forget
to use ebates before you shop online
definitely there may be a link to my
ebates down below i'm not sure i get
like 20 bucks when people sign up for
ebay so it's like five dollars and then
there's bonuses when people use my link
and the same thing for you if you sign
up for ebates and people set up for
ebates using your link and you get money
like actual physical money teammates is
amazing even if you don't use my link
you have to be using ebates because it's
like seriously like free money it's so
amazing don't forget to use ebates
before you go shopping at Ulta or a lot
a lot of websites use ebates um sarah
says she just got her first ebates check
and jordan also says the ebates his
amazing summer says he baits for the win
and Ellen says ebates rock yes
absolutely Amy Amy Jen Jen Jen Jen Amy
Amy Alexandra also says ebates are the
best all right I totally agree 70 said
she had the last vice palette in her
hands is for yesterday decided to pass
on it i don't i'm not i'm not sad that
you decided to pass on it i don't think
you're missing that much i think you're
cool there and then you're cool with
that yes posh chicks to face is coming
out with a peach scented palette yes
ma'am it is coming alright so what I'm
going to do now is I'm going to go to
the next item that I am very excited
about and now that I know you're going
to be able to see it the Garnier
micellar cleansing water I am looking
forward to trying that thanks to my
friend Shannon I got to try the micellar
water from bioderma and I am really
enjoying it quite a bit so I'm really
excited about the Garnier version I do
have a giant bottle of the of the
bioderma so I'm kind of going through
that central a/c justifying buying it
right now but definitely looking forward
to getting it at some point I've heard
really great things about it on it says
wrote this one is the one that removes
even waterproof mascara cleanses and
refreshes no wrench no harsh rubbing
face lips and eyes I do feel like with
the biodome out with I makeup I don't
feel like it removes without rubbing I
do feel like I really need to rub too
my makeup off I don't know if anybody
else feels that way i'm stephanie says
she loves the micellar water to as well
I'm 70 says it feels like water in your
face but it removes everything you know
I didn't Lily says that photo haunts me
it's on old sitcom Lily if you want to
get it um I'm a little bit blurry what
you can do is definitely click on the
wheel down below change the quality of
your um of your uh your what you call it
the little certainly wheely thing if you
can't see me I'm definitely click on
that and pump it up to HT d you should
be able to see this in HD um let's see
uh so anyway um so I Megan says where
did you buy biog emerged n i just bought
mine in London can't find here in the US
my friend Shannon bought it for me in
Canada I do think you might be able to
get in on the beautylish website I could
be wrong about that um and then Baxter
says it simple makes 12 bioderma is the
best sarah says anyone else by the
watercolor pantoea palette at sephora i
bought it and i'm so disappointed you
know Sarah I thought about buying that
but I decided not to because the colors
just weren't calling to me I really
wanted to want it and I just didn't so I
didn't get it and now I'm glad I didn't
get it now that I've talked to you about
it beauty talk with sam says jen
bioderma is the original and is truly
amazing i've tried the simple version i
don't think it's even close that's good
to know and summer says bioderma is
available on beautylish ma thank you
summer for that I appreciate you so much
um and and for some reason I don't know
why I definitely have more trouble
getting my eye makeup off with it I
don't know um megan says she's gonna cry
when her bio-thermal runs out Diana says
the Garnier water is the best for
sensitive skin and eyes also no more
dark circles back since using it
fantastic Diana I've heard that it's
wonderful for skin problems as well
because it's not harsh on the skin let's
see sess has anybody trout the nooks
hydro touch brightener I have not tried
that yet um and then Connie says and can
I be of most of stuff the UK does taylor
says uh yeah Tara babies on YouTube did
a review of the Pantone palettes watched
out horribly that is really good to know
i did not see posh check the
Maybelline's noob you
d blender thingy with a hand actually no
I did see the beauty blender thinking
with the handle let's bring that up real
quick the Beauty Blender thingy with the
handle because I did see it I'm going to
search I did not put it on the wish list
because i have seen products like this
let me show you first before um forests
are talking about so you know what I'm
talking about if I know how to spell
Maybelline will be in good taste good
shape here filter by noon and I can show
you what it looks like this thing right
here dream blender blending sponge looks
like this looks like a tower and India
to me so um so yeah I I've seen I think
it was maybe it was either ecotools I
think it was an eco tools tool like this
when I saw some reviews on it and then
the sponge just kind of broke off over
time that it just kind of gets weak and
breaks off which I can totally see
happening with something like this so
i'm not going to purchase that but i
will show you some other things that i'm
very excited about and the first one let
me show you speaking of drug store stuff

also I'm excited about some more things
oh we're going to get to the foundation
in a second because I want to go in
order so I don't miss anything I love
the lash sensational mascara there's a
new one called on it says luscious with
oil blend right there oh nicole says
lucky back is still available nice so
I'm very excited about this I want to
definitely want to purchase that let me
show you what I did get I haven't over
here do not love it is terrible oh my
god actually do not get this it's so bad
the covergirl clump of a blast pro in my
opinion with my lashes because
somebody's gonna get really upset
because they're because they loved it
but this was the one with that funky
like twisty red wand and I hate it it
was like thirteen dollars or twelve
dollars or some insane and it's horrible
don't get it don't get it don't get it
it's so bad it does nothing nothing
absolutely nothing that's from an old
movie called uhf i'm not sure if you've
ever seen that movie but anyway um yeah
don't get this don't get that I'm about
that over here Oh while we're talking
about new things that I got the plum 50
egg sorry I'm sorry I'm going back and
forth I'm getting distracted so I
apologize Maggie says the lucky bag is
sold out okay one thing I did want to
show you that I really like that I just
got is the mineral where talc free all
in one ABC cushion foundation by um a
little bit about by who is this by
physicians formula
we like this a lot of you can find it
but it's super duper uber expensive
right now though there's a sticker on it
you can get a rebate $9 mail-in rebate
for this it's got the little silly guy
on there and then you open it up and
then there's your cushion also it's
about half as much product as you get in
a full-size foundation it's under point
5 ounces which is crazy but um but I do
like it a lot I would compared to my
high-end foundations which I never say
about drugstore foundations like never
so really really loving this I want to
try the L'Oreal one that's also on my
list the L'Oreal 1 so 0 tabs back weapon
x back on her laptop she says beware of
my authority all rights anyway oh it's
like Jen just breathe I'm trying okay
okay Amy I'm gonna breathe center and
have to harness my Chi it is really
excited about stuff and I'm trying to
calm myself alright yaz Maybelline
Mabley Michelle says too little product
for me in the physicians form unless you
can get a super team and a lot of times
physicians formula will be on forty
percent whoa I'm feeling a little dizzy
alright if I pass out you'll know
because I didn't get enough oxygen to my
brain alright but anyway yeah so that
mascara I'm really excited about because
I like the original lash sensational
let's talk about another product that
I'm excited about the Maybelline brow
drama pomade crayon I'm a little nervous
for this one because pomade makes me
think it's gonna be goopy and sticky and
I don't like sticky so yes and then Jen
and Andy kitty one says that physicians
for my cushion would be good for travel
totally totally agree but yes I feel
like this is probably going to be like
on the Moshi kind of formula so I'm a
little nervous about it but I do really
want to try them very interesting
interested in it I'm gonna do my best
Lauren not to pass them all right
seventy says a strange when I was
younger the cover girl was like the only
thing I own but now they are just a big
disappointment coming from a woman who
has just bought all three of their
palates and primers oh I'm so sorry to
hear that
yeah I haven't had the glove with
covergirl either it's like the one that
I feel like is the least can well it's
the most consistently not good so um
Michelle says that brow pomade looks
pale looks way too big for my low
eyebrows and it might be it just might
be an Taylor said the exact same thing
right after him alright so but I have
big eyebrows so we might be able to
handle it over here with these Bush abay
bees I do need to get them done again
all right now here's the Maybelline
foundation we were just talking about
it's called the dream velvet soft matte
hydrating foundation there is that so
I'm excited to try that because it says
soft matte which I think would be
something that I would really really
like and Helen says the main thing she
gets in the drugstores mascara and I
think there's one thing that you get
from the drugstore always it's mascara I
really feel like it's rare that I find a
high-end mascara that beats my drugstore
mascaras very very rare very rare so um
okay and then Annie says when I started
buying makeup over a decade ago I put
all I purchases covergirl no longer the
case which makes me sad because it's
like you know what speaking of covergirl
I've got a cargo foundation for you it's
cover girl you've been around for how
long you've been making make up for how
long like how can you not make a good
eye shadow like really like you think
that they would have perfected it by now
but I really feel like they just chintz
on the ingredients you know like they're
just trying to make a buck or something
like it makes me upset because I know
they can do better and it's like if they
weren't capable of doing better like
then I be okay with it but it's like
you're kind of a girl your cover girl
you can do better than this you know it
just makes me upset makes me upset so
anyway speaking of covergirl the simply
ageless car girl + olay simply a + 3 + 1
liquid foundation this one looks kind of
interesting oh thank you love letter
thick love liar thank you so much she
likes my nails so Helen says I never
know what to tell my friends you can
only for a drugstore to buy anymore and
there's
a lot of really good drugstore products
any equivalents has a lot of really good
videos on drugstore products just have
been see you EBA as she's one of my
reporter she's a lot of really good
drugstore videos we looking for good
drugs for stuff I also know Stassi has
been stepping up her drug store videos
as far as good drugstore things oh and
then here's the l'oreal true match
cushion foundation that i wanted to show
you this is what that looks like have
heather says i got a knockoff Coastal
Scents palette off amazon and it was
better and cheaper I like my Coastal
Scents palette is overall Joey says I
got the benefit they're real but the
wand is too pokey for me you know a lot
of people say that about the benefit
they're real mascara that if the lawn
just post them in there under eyes like
in the was in the tight lines um and
just you know I've heard that definitely
first a beauty $12 lip therapy is
awesome summer says very cool very cool
um yeah everybody's talking about
Tottie's drugstore videos they are
really good nicole says did you see the
real techniques and eco tools brushes we
buy one get one free beep oh no they
won't I hope that was a precious metals
because those are really really nice I
like them a lot and then I love makeup
25 says the l'oreal cushion foundation
is awesome which is cool Stephanie likes
the Coastal Scents palette as well and
then kristen says they're real real is
way too wet for me and I've definitely
can see that delegate see that Helen
says I think physicians beauty is a hit
hit or miss but tati got some more via
her snapchat oh okay good to know good
to know Marlene says hi guys i got
perfume from the hugs and I don't think
I like it oh no what was it well you
know terrible um Taylor says structure
make up a still a little pricey yeah I
agree all drugstore makeup should be
like wet and la prices totally totally
totally agree and the thing is is what
in 11 actually has a really good
products and so does um like Jordana
they makes a really really good products
for very very cheap so and if you can
find Jacob ute at Bolton another one
essence another one you can get really
good makeup products for super super
cheap that are comparable to high-end
products really and truly there's no
reason unless or something Colin
let's say the chocolate bar palette
you're not going to find a dupe for the
chocolate bar palette anywhere because
no one has the chocolates nail and those
shadows are so unique they they're
really hard to do really hard to do
Marlene says it was Britney Spears
intimate fantasy okay gotcha gotcha
gotcha alright so I'm going to go ahead
and step away from my ulta card and go
into my Sephora cart and show you some
of the things that I'm interested in at
Sephora we talked a lot about drug store
stuff so let's talk a little bit about
some of the more high-end products one
of the ones that thing is very
interesting is the new laura mercier
candle blow soft luminous foundation I
think that looks really really
interesting we talked about that in last
week's uh what's up in makeup um and we
weren't sure when it was going to come
out and actually came out this week so I
think that looks really really
interesting um I don't want to go too
far back and I'm like reading and it's
so interesting but I don't want to like
confuse people that are watching later
let's go to the next thing there seem to
be see what we're complaining with the
laura mercier foundation that there
aren't enough warm tone shades just so
you know also this is very interesting I
might get this with birch box points
this is the they're real um eyelash
primer it's brown I think is very
interesting so i think i might get that
Jordan saying that the cover rules the
cover girls star wars mascara was
horrible my sister-in-law said the same
thing I didn't try it um and then Connie
says I've the foundation the the laura
mercier foundations looks really nice
she's never tried to laura mercier
foundation before and then lzm says i'm
looking for a good mascara that does not
flake during the day any recommendations
show any recommendations so my
recommendations oh let me get my masters
or bring it on ok so that doesn't flake
this doesn't flake on me the SS lash
princess this doesn't flake on me the i
heart extreme by essence um let's see
Maybelline lash sensational tart lights
camera lashes it's a good one Jordana
best / extreme
one and then today I use my steel a huge
mascara that one's a really good one to
someone told me that that flaked on them
now but those are some of the mascaras
that I personally am using right now and
recognize but definitely in the
collective brain definitely feel free to
mention some more that are good but i'm
excited i want i kind of want to try
this would you guys be interested in a
review of that I don't know definitely
put it in the collective brainer in the
comments below if you think you'd be
interested in a review of this because i
wanna i might get with Birchbox points
because i have enough Birchbox points to
get something um alright so then moving
on Tata Harper I have a love for Tata
Harper I don't know what it is I got
some skincare from Tata Harper and now
I'm like obsessed with Tata Harper stuff
so this looks really cool this is a
blush that I would really really like to
UM to try that's relatively new I think
it's online only though so I have to
order it online but I think that looks
really interesting and then this keeps
calling to me I don't know if I'm gonna
get it but it keeps calling to me the
TARDIS contour palette he was calling
tonight I probably won't get it but that
looks really interesting yes okay
everybody's talkin about they want me to
review it okay I'll get it on umm pocket
art I'm on the Birchbox website okay but
that thing cost me the other thing that
I'm really excited about is the benefit
shy beam dandelion shy beam this was
only in little kits for a long time and
now they have a full size so ooh my nose
is itchy I have a cold um beauty hot
bestest I've seen someone used a Tata
the takes it take Tata Harper cream
bronzer oh no I lost it comments going
too fast when I lost it nicole says
weird food that I want she wants to talk
pellet 20 that's Annie says it's a lip
and cheek the Tata Harper that's good to
know I lost the comment come on I lost
it I'm sorry totally lost it I'm itching
in the most like polite way this is like
the best way I can inch my nose without
being gross it may be a little simple
will be dead
alright but anyway I'm really excited
about the shy beam I think that's really
really cool so definitely looking
forward to that all right oh no that's
not going to happen I do a whole lesson
with my students I teach when I use on
my own classroom we do a whole lesson on
how to properly clean out your nose in
the middle of class which is not in
front of me because they forget that I'm
looking at them so that will not happen
ever on this channel I've never tried
the shy beam oh it hardly shows odd
karen says well not so excited about
that the leading from the basket thank
you so much for that I appreciate it
that's why i love the collective brain i
say she says your makeups totally on
point today love the whole look and what
is the lip color thank you so much I
appreciate that a lot of the lip colors
grunge by color pump with a little bit
of um angeles by ofra just tacked in the
middle a little bit um so thank you so
much for that that is so nice of you um
good under I corrector um so I don't
have really big like under eye circles
um but what I would recommend based on
reviews would be the naked concealer by
urban decay because I saw my friend
Cassie review it and it totally sold me
on it she said it's like the best
concealer she has ever used as far as
like dark circles another one that's
really good is from Eve pearl it's a
salmon shade so it definitely
counteracts like that pinky shade so it
counteracts the purple shades that some
people can get under their eyes so there
you go Annie says she wants a
kathleenlights collab with color pop she
likes it all I'm trying not to order
from colour-pop anymore it's like a
black hole of money where I just keep
throwing all of it in the color pop lips
lip products I don't need any more lip
products I'm not even going to review
them like maybe one day I'll do my color
pop collection but it's like not in the
plans I don't need any more color pop so
Michelle says you use the corrector
first yes
you know I because I don't have on dark
under eye circles it's hard for me to
understand the process of correcting
before concealing and sometimes because
I am so ignorant of it I get this
feeling that sometimes companies market
things as correctors when they're really
a concealer is there really that big of
a difference like really and I think
that it's just my ignorance about it you
know I don't know Maggie said the best
approach for her blue purple shadows is
benefits erase paste lightly and then
bare minerals concealer serum vas
concealing I have ever done and I had a
friend that used to have really bad acne
scarring and she swore by erase paste
she only she very rarely bought it
because it's the of the price of it but
she had looked really bad acne scarring
and it covered it so well so so well so
that's an excellent recommendation
Maggie thank you so much for that I'm
Zoe says would be nice if there was
something they did both mm-hmm um and
then Taylor says no it's not your
ignorance you're right a hundred percent
agree I don't know I don't know because
I don't have that issue so it's hard for
me to things when I don't have that
problem you know what I mean so I don't
like to speak about it steph says she
wishes her under eye circles one way
mm-hmm um anyway let's move on Connie
says the array space is amazing for dark
circles and lasts forever very cool all
right so I'm going to go ahead and see
what else is in my Sephora cart let's
see oh there was one oh there's two oh
there's a few more things this was very
interesting for high-end the girl on
liquid eyeliner they only have the brown
left there's no black but look how
gorgeous that is i'm indy kitty 1gen
saying correction is the fixed color I
know I understand that but if you get a
really good concealer doesn't that
pretty much do the same thing I don't
know i mean i guess like that's why they
have like the correct your parents to
correct before you conceal i guess
that's the point of them
so yes that's cool thank you for
teaching me I appreciate you I will
never say that I know everything there's
no way so all right but thank you for
that Jen I appreciate you but yeah isn't
that gorgeous I don't think I'm gonna
get it but it's really pretty it's one
of those things that I would like
display all right hold on a second give
me a second I have to like wipe my nose
a little bit but I don't want to do that
on camera does my derail that place all
right I don't like to do that on camera
so anyway so yes I think this looks
really cool Lilly says no it turns gray
under your eyes okay well that's what
you know Thank You Lily for that nicole
says Lily Spurgeon has a great video and
covering bags in circles thank you very
much for that Nicole I've missed that
one so thank you nicole for that and it
Sandra the lip is grunge from from
colour-pop so thank you so go over if
you want to know about covering
under-eye circles Lily Li ly Spurgeon
spu RG EO m and watch her under I
correcting video and supposedly it is
amazing I will be watching it it's ok
Jen I love you anyway I will be watching
it as soon as this video is done as long
as my family doesn't drag me in the
house go to dinner and then I will be
watching it later so yes I feel bad I
haven't seen that video I should watch
it alright so another from all right Oh
lily I love you alright so Smashbox has
a new brow tech shaping powder which
looks very interesting it's one of those
where you dip the brush into a powder in
a cons and then you swipe it onto your
lashes lashes on to your eyebrows which
seems very very interesting so I'm very
excited about that l MZ says she got the
Urban Decay smoky palette for Christmas
but but I'm not too sure if I want to
keep it since you did say the Coastal
Scents duped it um not the Urban Decay
Oh the Urban Decay smoky palette yeah um
um well me you're so cute um
sorry I'm reading okay Jenna wants to
know if the bonbon palette is much
different or better than chocolate bar
palette I don't own the bomb I'm hot I'm
probably not trying to get it I've heard
that it is very very different but the
formula is similar in that it's
wonderful but I've heard that the shades
are completely different um but yes I'm
excited about this I'm always looking
for things for my brows because my brows
are these crazy spaces in them and I
don't have brow product in so I need
good brow products so yeah 20 minutes
left hill and I know I know we're almost
at the end of my on my cart though okay
okay there's only two more things left
in my cart so I should probably slow
down a little bit someone everyone have
things to talk about no no we'll just
keep going all right Smashbox has an
instant matte lipstick transformer
there's also one that's like a glossy
one I think which sounds very
interesting to me I'm excited about that
I would like to try that I think that
sounds like fun hold on a minute I gotta
wipe them out of their moms all shouting
on camera look weird all right how much
gonna put it over here so I can just
bend down instead of money to go all the
way over there all right then yeah they
say all right real people here were real
people here I but I'm very excited about
this um Helen says we'd never run out of
things talk about that's true that's a
good point um so anyway all right so I'm
excited about that I think that would be
fun to try and see if it works and try
it on a bunch of different lip products
and see if it see if it works I think
that would be great and then the last
thing that's all my on my list are the
TARDIS live paints I think that would be
really that I really really like to try
that formula really really excited about
that so hopefully it's very very good
I'm looking forward to my favorite um
lip liquid lipstick channels to review
this like stephanie nicole is really
really wonderful liquid lipstick reviews
I'm really excited to umm to see a
review of from her on this I hope that
she doesn't this shade that I just
clicked on is called
TBT and it's a mob shade but there's a
lot of really pretty shades in here
there's another one this one is called
foam oh and that's a mauve I wonder what
the difference is between the two I
think some of the looks a little darker
70 says if you let color pop you
probably won't like the tart ones why
I'd like to know why it's interesting i
also like i really like the Oprah ones
to Cheyenne says i love the lip paints
color wise but they're a little drawing
that's good to know ha shucks wants to
try the TARDIS lip paints as well and
whoa too fast you fast you fast and miss
things I'm Stacy says she loves the new
L'Oreal Pro matte lip gloss not drying
cool great to know is it math though cuz
I've heard the drugstore one's really
aren't really not so Sarah says I wanted
FOMA but missed out LOL how appropriate
I don't even know what FOMO stands for I
don't even know what it is yes famosa
for exclusive for VIP yes I remember you
reporting on that Nikki I think that was
you that reported on it um crystal says
jan your lip color so nice i want to see
what unicorn tears would look like on
top I didn't enjoy the way that it
looked I'll swatch it for you though
enjoy it doesn't I wasn't feeling it
tonight but I will give you a nice giant
swatch so there's grunge on its own and
then here is fear of missing out oh okay
got it and then here is grunge with
unicorn tears let me put a swatch a
brunch without unicorn tears next to it
so you can see there you go so this one
here is grunge by itself and that's
grunge with unicorn tears on top so
there you go now you know so many
exciting things there's also something
some things that are not in my shopping
cart that I'm really excited to get this
year I want to try the elf smudge pots
because you send your raves about them
so much and so many people raise
rave about the smudge pots I also want
to try the Milani liquid lipsticks ever
wonderful things about the Milani liquid
lipsticks and really really really like
to to try those so those are some big
ones as well um crystal says she's
loving that combo and karen says she
needs unicorn tears like unicorn tears I
got it off of the UM the two-faced
website but I don't know I don't know if
they're selling it anywhere else I think
on before i think is selling it um yes
and then Bad Kitty beauty says that she
likes the elf smudge pots as well Zoey
says she wants to try the Revlon liquid
lipsticks and Stacy says he also much
parks are not good for over 40 eyes oh
that's good to know i'll have to try it
i'll try it and see if my eyes cuz I'm
37 so it's getting there Cassie's here
from thrift big hi Cassie I'm so happy
here yeah that makes me happy crystal
says um I'm sorry Kristin says she can't
find unicorn tears in Canada and Lisa
she loves the smudge pots Jen says el
smudge pots are very good at inexpensive
I need to try them everybody's like I
love your videos yes everybody loves her
videos because they're amazing um let's
see taylor says very curious about the
cushion foundation yeah I want to try
the L'Oreal one really bad yes you're
just talking about your little while ago
and you're naked um concealer review and
how it made me buy it Cassie made me buy
you and now I'm gonna try and um but
anyway so this is the UM the mineral
cushion from physicians formerly that I
showed a minute ago I really am super
excited about this I wish it wasn't so
stupid expensive and I wish there was
more product in there I think it's dumb
that there's so little product in here
but look at this packaging this is what
you're paying you're paying like five
bucks just for this packaging so
gorgeous so gorgeous Jennifer says my
husband is watching football and I'm
chatting with you well I am happy that
you're here chatting me and I'll wash in
the football um Cassie makes me feel
like I'm sitting in our living room when
I watch your videos summer says I agree
I agree um alright so let's talk about
some more things that works
it about buying you have 15 minutes left
to chat and I'm out of product and i
left my phone over here alright let's
see what else we can find oh right see
I've never was it and threw it too fast
um Bosh again what did you not get for
Christmas that you still want everything
in this video everything in this video
stuff that I want um X makeup 822 says I
level I like the l'oreal cushion
foundation but I wouldn't say it's
amazing very nice yeah I cast him saying
she likes the on the the Urban Decay
concealer but it is a little bit pricey
I do like it Cassie but I got to light
of a shade so I have to use it as a
brightener rather than a concealer but I
do like it and he says pixie is now on
hautelook and she likes their eyeliners
i missed the rest of it cuz it went too
fast Cheyenne wants to know which
chocolate bar palette to get i do not
own the semi-sweet but i have heard that
the original is better than the
semi-sweet overall that seems to be the
general consensus not everybody agrees
with that but i have heard about that um
I've also heard that the bon mots pound
is also finna so I don't know all I can
speak to is that the original has my
heart the original absolutely has my
heart hi Caro and then ray says I would
have to say Mac has the best I shadows
and lipsticks hands down and I really
need to get some mac that's another
thing I need to do is get some mac
eyeshadows in my life in 2016 because i
don't own hardly any mac eyeshadows
they're just so stinking expensive it's
hard for me to go in there and and be
able to pal it with mac eyeshadows
because it's like ching ching ching and
it's just painful it's painful for me to
do that it's like do I really need this
really like I've heard they're amazing
so um Taylor says you have a favorite
formulas far as high an eyeshadow yes
and i will say two-faced and kat von d
are definitely my favorite eyeshadow
formulas of all time then
most consistent um I feel like every
other brand is very inconsistent but
even Kat Von D and um and two-faced half
inconsistencies like villagran palace
from Too Faced was pretty terrible about
half the palette was pretty terrible and
then Kat Von D's holiday pout last year
about half of it was pretty terrible so
there's definitely some mrs. in every
brand but i would say they are
definitely the most consistent michelle
says why buy Mac when you can get better
quality for cheaper prices from other
brands and I think the reason why I need
to buy neck is for a basis of comparison
it's not because I actually need it in
my life it's because I really should
have it being a reviewer awesome earth
says she thinks max overrated too but I
think a lot of people feel like that Mac
is amazing I do but I've heard also like
Beth is saying she loves makeup geek
eyeshadows I've heard a lot of people
say the makeup geek eyeshadows are very
comparable to the UM to the mac
eyeshadows and they're half the price
less than half the price so I don't know
I don't know it's really hard to say so
he says she got her first mac lipstick
but someone bought it for her I hope I
think maybe four or five mac lipsticks
that I do like them I think they're very
very nice but I'm not like jumping out I
see to get more i like the two face look
Chrome's better and that's just I just
like the feel of them Helen says Manny
anyway started at Matt counters and they
use them as comparison for shades wow
that's very interesting to me very
interesting to know um let's see crystal
says her favor kat von d two-faced and
urban decay and then lisa says the
l'oreal matte lip gloss surveil Arnhem
oh I she wants know if they're available
in canada i do not know anna maria she
loves Mack and Beth says mug has less
talc than mac makeup geek has less talc
in the product than Matt Gina says she's
been alerted to every mac on every Mac
I've ever tried beside the studio fix
and Cassie says I'm honestly never
understood the hype about mac eyeshadows
they're just so many other better I
shows for cheaper out there see this is
like what do I do now what do i do I
don't know what to do it's like such a
50-50 split when it comes to my gosh
it was it really is and I did get the
Cinderella palette and I was not super
impressed it was fine but it was not
super impressed it really wasn't um
favorite Sephora brand products Jordan
one wants to know I like the matte lip
cream thing he the matte lip things from
before those are really nice I did like
their cream blushes but those are now
discontinued there's no cream blush if
you want to try bug-free blush in the
sale section of Sephora website they
have my favorite one it's something Rose
rose glow I think is what it's called
and it's on the sales section right now
so its twenty percent off of that it's a
really nice cream blush was actually my
favorite I think it made my 2012
favorites video when i first started my
channel i did a giveaway and that was
one of the things that i gave away as
part of my favorites i actually went out
and purchased a bunch of extras of my
favorite things and then I did a
giveaway of the products that were my
favorite things so that was one of the
things in that giveaway so yeah now
that's a really nice product that's now
going to be gone other support products
that I really like their mascara is
really bad is so bad it is probably the
word one of what can save the worse but
one of the worst mascaras I have ever
used it's called the mascara it is the
trippiest mascara and i do not have
watery eyes I have very like not normal
i won't say normal but not problem eyes
and this is just the worst formula i
have ever used it was all under my eyes
by the end of the day and i have never
had that happen to me with the mascara
ever in my entire life one thing I can
say though about this mascara though
that's super cool is look at the
packaging so when you pull it out
there's actually like a hole there where
it goes inside so that the product stays
inside the tube instead of coming out
like tart lights camera lashes you see
how it's like it's this way so the
products comes out here but with this
it's inside so the product doesn't come
out which i think is super cool the
formula is horrible absolutely horrible
Lilly says she likes us up
or bland Tran lip liners they're
inexpensive and they work fantastic um
and I've never tried their lip liners
I'm like I'm missing something with a
for brand that I really really like
totally missing it I know I like their
lip products I can't think of it though
there's gotta be something else um I
can't think of it whoa I don't know
their shadows are kind of inconsistent
their eyeshadows so I don't know um and
crystal says that's a large brush I'm
scared it's not as long as the one on
one's not as what are some other ones
like let me see where's my Smashbox mark
let me show you 10 minute I the Smashbox
mon-sun off a slide I think it's a nice
snug I don't know I got it in one of
these other boxes which one undergone in
did it come in my bird box which 1i have
to keep reaching in these subscription
boxes no no maybe this one I don't know
I lost it I can't find it but the
Smashbox the photo but already won or
photo finish I brush is huge that brush
is insane well we can look at this one
in comparison so this is the covergirl
clump of fine blast pro tab ASCAP and
here's this a 401 show ish there's
definitely bigger brushes out there but
it is pretty big it's pretty big uh
let's see Meggie says none that
something yeah Maggie says I heard great
things about their serum concealer but
she hasn't tried it and Michelle says
i've been using the Sephora a solid bar
brush cleaner so much cheaper than the
Beauty Blender and it's just as good
awesome Helen says a lot of people like
peach smoothie for a transition shade
from makeup geek and Zoe says Smashbox
exposure is what I got I have it
somewhere i think it's is it it here
with it normal oh no won't let it be let
it be let it be let it be let it be
Smashbox I shadows Jenna wants no
Smashbox I shadows are so inconsistent
for me sometimes they're really good
sometimes they're really really bad
really bad like really really really
really really bad so Smashbox as a brand
is like that for me very good and very
bad Lily says sephora lip stains are
also very cool um and emily is it Emily
I'm gonna say Emily who else loves milk
cosmetics I haven't tried anything
remote cosmetic so I cannot say it I
don't new summer says the NARS audacious
is a disaster the NARS audacious was
horrible horrible horrible horrible i
have in my empties okay okay nars
mendacious worse worse mascara it's just
as bad as this one like I would compare
these two both red and black both
terrible totally different price points
but terrible this like poke my eyeball
out look at that one Oh terrible did not
like it I hadn't met anybody that likes
this NARS mascara not one person I don't
know how NARS does that their nerves you
know it's a cover girl how does and
especially NARS with their price point
how did I let that happen you know
covergirl least it's less expensive but
NARS come on really I'm Alan says she
has an arse eye shadow that's lovely yes
nose eye shadows are very lovely and
their blushes are very lovely too jenna
says she liked it for the lower lashes I
don't really put mascara on my lower
lashes it looks weird on me so I don't
oh and Nicole yes she says I know what I
want camp cosmetics I shadows I just
watched Nicole's 2015 favorites video
where she talks about camp cosmetics
eyeshadows definitely make sure you
check out the UM the videos that people
made their 2015 favorite videos the
reporters Nicole at yay or nay nuke hole
on YouTube I'm saying again yay
ornette nakone she did a 2015 favorites
video in collaboration with me today and
she talked about the camp cause max I
shadows I know Kristen game talks by the
camp cosmetics eyeshadows and I really
feel like I need to try them now because
she said no Nichole owns burberry and
chanel and she owns and all these fancy
shmancy I shadows right oh wait you know
what it wasn't Nicole hold on a minute
was it Nicole or was it now I'm thinking
it might not have been Nicole maybe with
Susan's video hold on a minute wait a
minute hold on a minute wasn't Nicole it
was Susan I watched all his favorites
videos today and I'm getting them
confused Susan w is one Nicole's video
was excellent as well but Susan w was
the one that I think that talked about
camp cosmetics yes because she was
talking about how many eyeshadow she
owns and she said camp cosmetics are the
best formula she has ever used which i
think is amazing like a little tiny
little indie brand and then these
amazing eye shadows it was Susan w Thank
You Beth it was Susan but Nicole's video
is excellent as well don't neglect
Nicole but Susan w also had a very
wonderful video of her favorites she
also talked about the bye bye under eye
concealer in her video which was very
good and one thing you can see in Nicola
yea or nay Nicole you can see my t-shirt
that she wore the video which is super
cute that collective brain of makeup
awesomeness t-shirt from cafepress is
there in her video too um Helen says I
keep thinking camptown ladies when she
says camp cosmetics you have done ladies
sing this song doodah ok that's enough
of that that was terrible Taylor says is
there any way I can be notified when
you're going to have a live chat this is
the first one I've seen um Taylor we
usually do them because it actually is
wrap up time we do do them on sunday
mornings at ten a.m. easter time is our
typical time so that is the first three
well however many sundays there are in
the month and then the last sunday of
the month we usually do it 5pm so just
kind of keep in mind for that also
underneath what's up in makeup you'll
see a link to the chat usually it pops
up about 9 45 it might it'll probably
say coming soon to about 9 45 and then
around them I put the link um and if you
check like a few minutes after ten it
should be there you can also go to my
channel and it should be there as well
um you should be able to go to my
channel around 10am and find it and
click on it so I'm so happy you made it
to Michelle that makes me happy and I'm
bad Katie says she really makes the
checks cuz she never wakes up Sunday
mornings and the reason why they're so
early is because sundays are my family
days so I try to you know I want to
spend the day with my family so I do it
early and then in the evenings I don't
do it later because also I want to spend
time with my family so we're actually
going about to go out to dinner so I'm
gonna go ahead and end the chat now but
I thank you guys so much for this
wonderful conversation I'm really
excited about all of the products that
are coming out I'm excited about all
I've learned from the collective brain
today thank you so much for being here
collective brain you guys are amazing
and the reason why I called collective
brain Nicole in her video described it
perfectly is it's because you know we
all try different products you know we
all have different skin tones and skin
types and you know one of three eyes and
sensitive skin and tease own issues and
acne scarring and you know all kinds of
things that we deal with your sparse
eyebrows and thick eyebrows in no
eyebrows and we all have all these
different experiences so as the
collective brain we can come together
and recommend products that are good for
anybody because when we work together we
can do so much more than when one person
by themselves those reviews you know
because we're all together talking about
things that are either really good or
really bad and when we all agree on it
then we can really say okay this is a
good product or a bad product rather
than just one person's opinion you know
so it's pretty awesome it's pretty
awesome I'm so thankful you guys I
really genuinely am and I a manual in
the new year I'm really thankful for how
this community has come together and
it's what I've always wanted on YouTube
even when I have my channel back in two
thousand six what's called jen left 37

laughs 37 um you know even when I had
that channel I really wanted to have a
community and I didn't really quite get
there with that channel and I feel like
I've finally gotten to that with this
channel and I'm it's
