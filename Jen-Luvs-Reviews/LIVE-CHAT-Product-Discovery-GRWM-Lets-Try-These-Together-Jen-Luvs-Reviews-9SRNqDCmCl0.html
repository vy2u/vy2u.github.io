live chat I think I fixed the screen
sizing issue I think I fixed the audio
issue I'm hoping that we're good you
know what I did not fix is the coffee
issue because my coffee is way over
there and that needs to happen happy New
Year to everybody I know it's New Years
Eve
but hopefully you have you have a
wonderful evening tonight celebrating
this is actually my husband John and i's
15-year anniversary of the night that we
met we met at a New Year's Eve party I
went with my um my good friend Amy who
happened to be his stepsister and she
introduced me to her brother and the
rest was history yeah it was a good
night we'll just say that it was a good
night where I pretended to fall asleep
on the couch so that he would go to bed
and leave me alone but anyway it was a
really good night but anyway so welcome
welcome today the idea of this chat is
going to be to do some getting ready
with me with some products that I've
been neglecting they've been sitting
around waiting to be tried it seems like
there's always a new product coming out
you know right there's always a new
product coming out there's always
something happening and you know I try
whatever the hype is around but then the
products that there isn't as much hype
around I kind of forget about me never
get tried so I figured I would take some
of those products today and we would try
them on camera and kind of you know
maybe find some new favorites possibly
which would be amazing so I'm gonna go
ahead and just take a minute to do my
disclaimers because every time I don't
do this claimers I get comments so first
of all oh wait I only have to do one
because we're doing it getting ready
with me I do do this as a live chat in
that I do talk to the community during
live chat if this is not your preferred
format it's no problem
I completely understand there are people
that don't prefer a live chat if you
don't there is a ton of content on my
channel that hopefully you will enjoy
and you know I've been doing live chats
for three four years I mean a really
really really really really long time
really long time so and I love them and
I love hanging out with the community
but if it's not you I completely
understand
if you're watching this on the replay
feel free to leave your thoughts in the
comments down below comments help me in
the YouTube algorithm so as many
comments as you want to leave it's
totally cool with me don't feel like you
gotta squeeze them all into one comment
if you're watching anything cuz
something you can comment I'm not gonna
hate on you for leaving 15 comments
because it's actually good for me in the
end
because it's considered engagement so go
ham in the comments leave all your
comments

I'm gonna say hi to the first people

mug that I made it's got pictures of my
kids on it I need to make more of those

that she sent me in this getting ready
with me that I've been neglecting that I
want to
want to show you I think I've got
actually it might just be one thing
Nancy sent me but I'm excited to use it
because I've been neglecting it and
let's see oh I lost it
Consuelo oh there you go Consuelo and
good morning to you if I did not say
good morning to you good morning to you
good morning to Bobby I've been really
enjoying your comments lately thank you
so much I saw you recently watched my
my-y I quit teaching video so thank you
Bobby for watching that I appreciate it
alright and Elise is here the gang's all
here all my reporters are hanging out
welcome welcome welcome alright so let's
go ahead and get started the first thing
I've been neglecting that I got this I
think and like I go to generation beauty
by epsy and they give you like a big
swag bag full of stuff and this is
something I believe that came in my swag
bag it is a sample of the makeup forever
step one base I've never used this
product before I'm gonna throw it see I
can hit my trash oh quit my quit my job
as a youtuber and join a basketball team
because that was epic throwing it into
my trash can I wish you could have seen
it alright so let's go ahead and try
this I've never tried it I would love to
know if you've tried it what you think
of it okay I was expecting the more
silicon primer but it looks like it's
more of a I don't know maybe it is
silicone II a little bit Wendy says good
morning Wendy good morning Wendy Julie
says Jen are you upset with me you
skipped over me twice no Julie I'm sorry
Julie M I'm not upset with you I'm sorry
I think I saw Julie loot and I
accidentally skipped you because I
thought I already said hi to Julie so I
apologize Julie it was just because
there was already in Julie and I thought
I already said hi to Julie it was not
personal I promise if I skip over you
there's very few people in the world
that I am not happy with in the moment
so chances are it's not you and most of
the people that I'm not happy with
absolutely know that I'm not how to
actually I think everybody that I'm not
happy with knows that I'm not happy with
them I'm a pretty straightforward person
so I have following guys alright that
felt really good it was not real slimy
it's not really in any way it just kind
of disappeared it feels like I can't
even feel it Melissa says the step one
feels a little bit about the Smashbox
and texture but I don't think
you see is the Smashbox pore filling one
the purple team I agree with you Melissa
and I feel like there isn't as much
consistency to it like I feel like it's
gone excuse me I feel like it's very
lightweight and gone where I feel like
the Smashbox the original one is kind of
heavy almost especially if you
accidentally put on too much it's kind
of heavy but this one just makes my face
feel a little bit satiny so yeah I'm
reading comments as I go but yeah it
feels good I'm ready to move on so the
next thing is something that's been
sitting my drawer for a while that I
purchased I don't want to do super full
coverage sakes I'm just hanging out with
my family so the super BB hashtag inch
to ready by Physicians Formula I talked
about I even had this so let's go ahead
and you ooh that's might be why we're
gonna have it it looks kind of dark well
if it's dark I'm just hanging out with
my family oh that's really dark let me
put it on my hand and test it oh that's
not that bad oh I don't know I don't
know I can probably get away with it
with my freckles maybe a little bit
we'll try it we'll try it and see
actually I might have gotten this in the
gym beauty swag bag too now that I'm
thinking about it I thought I'd purchase
it but now I'm not sure if I purchased
it or not because I know I was looking
at it to purchase but did I actually
purchase it I don't even know Wanda says
hi Jen first time being able to catch
you live great way to start my Sunday oh
very happy New Year to you as well
let's see I'm not using a mirror as like
so no mirror makeup challenge right this
second right now it just feels like
regular muffin it's got a little bit of
a set to it a little bit of a strong
kind of floral set but it's not like
super offensive or anything and this is
definitely the wrong color I am
immediately turning orange oops
I have to look and see what shade it is
I'll go back and look in a second and
this is just a kabuki brush from a brand
called outer beauty I believe oh no this
is beauty junkies beauty junkies you can
get on Amazon they're super cheap and
they're really really really good they
remind me of my Sigma brushes I am going
to have neck face I'm totally gonna have
neck face you guys no neck face when
your neck is a different color than your
face you know that's
all right well I might have to change my
shirt to cover up some of my nephew see
how orange I am I'm like straight up
yellowy orange oh well
such is life we're just gonna keep going
oh my gosh I'm so I'm looking at myself
in the monitor I am so the wrong color
right now well maybe we can put some
powder on it and you know fix it somehow
or this is light medium light medium
Steph says how can you do your makeup
without pulling your hair back I never
understand youtubers doing this um I
don't know I never seem to get it in my
hair and if I do I just kind of go like
this I guess I just don't care enough is
that bad that I don't care enough
I am so the wrong color
that's okay we're just gonna keep going
we're gonna keep going all right next up
so anyway it went on very nicely I like
the coverage but it's just the wrong
wrong color oh well okay we're gonna go
into concealer this is something that I
know I purchased this is the julep
cushion complexion five and one skin
Perfector with turmeric I remember I did
a review on I did a what was that series
I used to do it was when I tested
Pinterest hacks Oh Pinterest Busters and
I did it with turmeric I made like
turmeric toothpaste and I spell I said
it was tumeric it's because that's the
way I've always said it for some reason
and I had to private the video because I
was so embarrassed that I said the word
wrong which was the main thing that the
video was about so I actually private
adapt video but hopefully I'm saying it
right now if Laurie says bronzer stat I
know right I'm gonna have to figure it
out I'm letting it go for now but I
might just have to paint down my neck
I'll say we'll see what happens but
anyway I have used this concealer a
couple of times but I've never showed
you so I figured I wouldn't bring it on
camera latina is here hello hello have
you tried you are
peanut butter and jelly palette yet I
sent Latino my um peanut butter and
jelly palette
she asked me she's a longtime subscriber
comments all the time
and she said hey I'll take that peanut
butter jelly palette you're not gonna
use it the one that I got in my to face
mystery box so I sent it to her so
hopefully you're enjoying it Jenny says
everybody misses the mispronounces
something ain't no thang girl when
you're on the internet and you are
putting yourself out there for the world
it is a thing people get very upset
especially if he used to be a teacher
and why is this not coming out I've
clicked this like 900 times it's not
coming out hello I know I'm click oh
there we go
it's coming out it looks just the same
color as the UM as the BB cream we're
just gonna be orange all over the place
what shade is this this is the shade
nude I hate you can I just say how much
I hate when people say nude as a shade
like who's nude who's naked because not
everybody is cut this color when I'm
naked just just so you know julep I
really I that bothers me so much I don't
know why certain things like I know that
the trendy word is triggered like it but
certain things trigger me and the shade
color nude always bothers me
alright well that was very light I don't
even know what happened there did it
even do anything I'm just blending in
with my fingertip because I don't want
any product to be eaten up by a brush I
guess it did something it kind of
lightened it a little bit agreed nude is
not one single shade Aspen says hello
Aspen how are you my friend
the ex Cal says oh wow you sound like a
ventriloquist you're talking butt looks
like your mouth is saying something else
go oh go ahead and refresh the screen if
that's happening to this city of the
silent this is julep and it was
definitely a lighter coverage it kind of
brightened my undereyes a little bit but
didn't do a whole lot Wow
all right so this is brows I've got
another julep product this is the don't
leave your brows at home and it's got a
brush on one side can you guys see that
and then Shan says that nude isn't my
noob I know and that nude isn't probably
85% of people on the planets know
neither it's not even my nude it's too
like to be my nude and then so it's got
the brush on one side and then it's got
a brow gel and the other side look uh
that almost like a dip brow brow gel on
the other side which is kind of cool I
have used this once or twice Gigi says
Jen so good to see you so good to see
you too Gigi it's nice Gigi I haven't
seen mean Gigi in a while I have a nice
Gigi and I mean Gigi I mean Gigi knows
I'm not happy with her but I won't block
her because technically it's
constructive criticism but Abby says
nude sticks good I do like the nude
sticks pencils
I like the trend remember the formula oh
that looks really pretty I can get it
it's not the matte one I don't think but
anyway nude sticks overall I really do
like their their pencil formula it's
very creamy don't expect a huge lasting
power this is actually extremely
functional I really like that I think
that look
really pretty like that
Amanda says I've paused what's my makeup
and another winner to go back and finish
after this oh thank you so much I
appreciate it
Julie says Emily Noel just did an all
julep video oh cool I know that she
really likes the the liquid lipsticks
which I also very much love I really
like this that came out really pretty
I'm surprised because it's not too thick
but it's not to try it's a really nice
consistency I don't know about this
format those formats a little bit weird
I don't know if you can see the product
in there but I like it
Abby says I got the matte sticks for
lips and it's dry I think I'll have to
look and see the nude sticks which ones
are the ones I like I haven't been a
drawer right there so as soon as I'm
done for my brows I'll go look all right
one thing I learned from my my brow
person at Ulta because I go get my brows
done at Ulta at the benefit brow bar is
she said to do the bottom first and that
has really been helping me a lot to do
my brows is to go over the bottom of my
brow first and then do the the top do
they match though no I need to bring
this one up a little more I hate when I
have to said this a million times
getting ready I hate when I do one side
and I like it but then I mess at the
other side so I have to make the match
do they match am i matching I hope so
yes constructive criticism Kelly I hope
you like constructive criticism going I
really want to be sillier like and bring
out that side of me because I'm a very
silly person like if you saw me as a
teacher like I was so silly that
eventually the kids got bored with me
being silly because I was just too silly
all the time so they were like oh it's
just you know mrs. G all over again yes
she's just G just being silly again you
know I mean they just got bored because
I was always selling it was kind of
overkill but in the beginning of the
year captivated them for like the first
half of the year and the second half of
year they were like alright whatever I'm
over this this is don't leave your brows
at home by julep really really enjoyed
that that's probably my favorite product
why I know it's my favorite product of
you so far all right let me go check
that nude sticks because it's right here
right here okay this is the nude sticks
that I like this is the boss babe fave
color box that's right here and they did
give this to me at generation Beauty I
always like to tell you let me see what
formula this is okay this says lip and
cheek pencil no no it just says lip and
cheek pencil oh this here we go
the magnetic matte lip color is that it
and no they're all different looks like
there's intense matte I thought it was a
different one maybe maybe it's the
magnetic matte I don't know let me see
what are the ones that I like I really
like this one I think no that's not it I
don't know man I just like them but it
sounds like the matte one for you did
not work so that's good to know
but I remember wearing these for like
two weeks straight like didn't want to
use any other lip products right after I
got it and then of course lately I've
been neglecting them Gigi says I have
two nude sticks in my shopping cart
after Emily's review yeah they're I've
really enjoy them chance as my browser
never on the same page I've given up
trying to get them to get along from a
long time ago oh my gosh I've been
watching more James Charles lately James
Charles yes
where he's like my brows aren't what was
it he was like my brows aren't twins
they're sisters or whatever cuz he's got
his sisters thing I don't know sometimes
I really like James Charles and
sometimes I'm like oh my gosh he's been
he's been very nice to me though he's
been good to me
alright this shade is called rich Brown
I was asked that I didn't see who it was
but I was asked what shade was alright
let's go ahead and move on to eyeshadow
primer this is a primer that I don't use
very often this is the essence i heart
color intensifying I haven't had great
luck with this but people keep telling
me how amazing it is and I haven't had
good luck with it and I don't know
what's going on why why me why me why me
Gigi says James Charles is so cute I
like I want to adopt him he's definitely
like I am curious what James Charles is
gonna be like when he's 25 to 30 like I
just
he's just he's and same thing with
Thomas Halbert like they are such kids
you know what I mean and they act like
kids and I can't expect them to act like
you know people that are older like
they're they're just such kids and I am
really looking forward to seeing them
grow up on camera I hope they both keep
their channels open and keep doing it
for a long time because I want to see
them grow and mature and you know not
not kids in a bad way just their kids
you know they're very different they're
at a different very very different place
in their lives than I am so it's it's
interesting to watch Kiefer wants to
know what polishes on my nails oh I
meant to bring it up it's the Marc
Jacobs nail polish that I got in the
Marc Jacobs mystery box and I meant to
bring it up in case anybody asked and I
completely forgot amber says that's how
I feel about all eyeshadow primers I
could never get them to work well I'd
rather just concealer and powder yeah
you know what I usually have really good
luck with eyeshadow primer especially
the Urban Decay primer potion Eden is my
favorite in that but the older one is
pretty much an exact dupe for that at
least from my personal experience and
looking at the formula they're very very
similar those are my favorites I also
really like the one from near and Ness
which is kind of a random brand but I
got it off HauteLook and I absolutely
love it so I usually have good a good
time with eyeshadow primers but this one
for some reason it hasn't been good to
me oh no what's going on all right so
let's go into I shall let me show you
what I was planning on doing for
eyeshadow Debbie says love James's video
we're influencers sent him makeup you
know I didn't watch that one I'll have
to watch that if you think that it's
good Erica wants to know if I ordered a
lucky box this year yes I did and I am
already regretting it because every year
I'm disappointed every single year this
will be my fourth one and every year I'm
like why did I do this again it's eighty
two dollars eighty two dollars and every
year I'm disappointed so I'm hoping that
this year is my year I'm hoping alright
so this is what Nancy had sent me these
are by pinky Rose cosmetics I have the
transition palette oh they're both
called the transition palette but one of
them is purple tones and one of them is
like almost like subculture II kinds of
tones so
we've got this one here and it's like
the purpley tones and then we've got
this one here that's like the subculture
II kinds of colors so I think they're
really really pretty so I figured I
would do a look with these I don't think
I want to be too matchy-matchy with my
shirts I think I'm gonna go ahead and
use the subculture II looking one like
the warm tone one I love the packaging
the packaging is so fun and unique it is
a cardboard packaging and it's got like
some like I don't know like squish it's
almost squishy on No maybe not I thought
it was squishy on the side but it's not
but it's just real thick there and then
it's got these really cool colors in
here so I figured we would play with
them and try all right so let's use this
color pop brush and we're gonna go into
fly girl ooh that just kicked up some
powder right there that's okay I'm not
hating on powder I just you know letting
you know Purple's are really nice I had
I did use the purple one before Laura
but I don't even know if I've used this
one yet if I've used it I've only used
it like once so let's just go and do
like a little transition oh that looks
very nice and I don't know the price
point on this because Nancy did send it
to me but if anybody feels like looking
it up I know somebody's gonna ask what
the price point is on it Mariana says I
brought I bought the lucky box because I
saw you mentioned on Twitter never heard
of it before I'm hoping for some awesome
products yeah and I think that part of
the problem with me getting mystery
boxes is that I do already own quite a
few products so when I get a mystery box
sometimes I get repeats or I get things
that are very similar as something that
I already know own so it's not as
exciting for me but last year was really
bad for me in that I didn't end up using
I used one product after that after that
video was over one product and it was
the Bioderma the my solar water that's
the only product I ended up using out of
that entire stinking box everything else
I Eve there passed on I think I passed
on everything or I have it but I don't
really use it but I probably should I
probably should pass it on could
probably use it that Atelier palette
where would that latina says Julio loves
your looking shirt today where's your
shirt from this shirt is from Amazon
I've been buying like cheap clothes off
at Amazon at least I went through like a
phase guess was maybe six months ish or
ago or something like that I forget what
exactly what it must have been a
long-sleeve season because they all
seemed good he long sleeves but must
spend about this time last year maybe
maybe April no I don't know anyway I got
him off Amazon and I've been really
loving the Amazon clothes I don't know
oh no it's probably bad buy stuff off
Amazon but I like them they're cute
Steph said hi Steph how are you my
friend she says I didn't get a good bag
last year I wouldn't have gotten a I
would have gotten wouldn't have gotten
the XL bag this year
I heard the XL bags some of the
unboxings that I saw the XL bags looked
really good last year alright this is by
a brand called Michael Marcus that I got
out of little black bag forever ago and
we're just going to mmm see I have a bag
this is the thing is people say you're
supposed to set the lid with powder
people tell me that all the time but I
have bad luck with that I feel like it
kind of dulls down the other shades so I
haven't been doing that because I don't
like the way that it looks so let's go
ahead and let's just do these two
shimmer shades and let's do let me see
them on my fingers and just kind of see
the tones there are the tones on my
fingers hmm
oh the greens kind of graying out a
little bit hmm
let's just do the this this shade and I
can dip into the other one too if we
want to and let's just put that all over
I'm surprised that green turn kind of
gray ooh that's pretty on the eye though
and I love how the shimmer picked up on
the brush so nicely that was effortless
absolutely effortless oh 20 least says
$22 on these that's really good
Thank You Elise for looking that up for
me I appreciate it hon all right that
went on effortlessly that was super easy
and I am very surprised I was not
expecting at
now this is a shade thirsty it's that
green I'm gonna kind of pop it over here
hmm
it's definitely graying out and it's not
as shimmery I might have to pop this
some of my finger or use some setting
spray or something
mm-hmm
see if I can get some more shine oh no
it's dropping oh no that is exactly what
happened to my color drain Cheers the
beauty palate and one of the shades
shattered video coming soon but yeah I
don't really like that I don't like that
at all let's see if we can fix it let's
see if we can doctor it oh my towels
over there just rub it in all right okay
I'm gonna take my finger and I'm going
to tap it in the peach and see if I can
layer it over top because I don't like
that at all
well that's looking better now
there we go Alex better just got to kind
of layer it back over but yeah I have my
coloured raine cheers the beauty palate
video is coming next week I'm done with
the with the filming of it I just have
to edit it but I do have two semi tears
of beauty palette back tomorrow because
they are going to give me a new one but
at the same time like I have to get it
back to them within 14 days or they
won't refund it at all which kind of
stinks but yeah it was just the one
shade the silver broke on me but you'll
see it in the video I'm very sad about
it all right how far did I get on the
other eye okay so we did this with the
brush now I have to remember what I did
oh my gosh Jenny says it's six degrees
in st. Louis I don't know what the
temperature is here but it's cold it's
very very very cold all right let's go
this way and then we'll just go back up
in the crease a little bit oh no a
little bit up there hopefully you can
see what I'm doing I know I'm kind of
far away from the camera and then we'll
Pat that bronzy kind of peachy shade
over top I like this this is turning out
good it's better than I thought it was
going to be all right let's blend it
blend blend blend we need to blend
Bart lever says can't wait for your
charity review I love colored rain but
was a bit underwhelmed by the color
selection on the layout yeah um it's
definitely a good palette it's
consistent with coloring quality but I
am NOT happy with some things about it
which surprised me because I'm a color
brain is like basically my Holy Grail I
shadow formula at this point so you know
whenever they let me down I get very
very sad Gigi wants to know if Georgia
is here I haven't seen Georgia yet
Georgia Harris if you're not subscribed
go subscribe to Georgia Harris she's
amazing on set here speaking of that we
need to bug candy Johnson do you know
why we need to bug candy Johnson we need
to bug her oh I don't like that let's
get out of that abort mission abort
mission
candy said on Twitter or something about
people you know turning positivity to
the beauty community candy needs to put
her money where her mouth is and bring
some positivity of the beauty community
and like do a collab with someone that
has you know 500,000 subscribers or
300,000 subscribers something like that
she needs to put her money where her
mouth is and do something is that it is
complaining about beauty community all
the time
candy Johnson I love her I met her once
she was so sweet but she needs to like
step it up and do something girl I want
to see her do good things I want to see
her be a leader and lead us all into a
new generation of makeup awesomeness on
YouTube oh by the way I didn't tell you
what I was doing
blog life this one right here is the one
I'm putting on here I think that looks
really really pretty the people complain
especially these bigger youtubers about
complaining about how terrible the
beauty community is blah blah blah well
do something about it and candy I can
see like grabbing somebody like julia
salvia you know somebody that's really
good at tutorials and just bringing them
up you know what I mean
let's be positive and support each other
now we don't have to be like all the
rest of YouTube where it's just big
people creating collaborating with big
people you know yeah bard lover says she
could collaborate with Lisa Stevens or
Kaley that I can never pronounce your
last name or Bailey B yes exactly
they're all amazing I agree
all right this look is coming out really
pretty I can't see the green at all
which makes me a little bit sad but it
is what it is the green is completely
gone
completely gone staff says I love me
some candy I've met her but she's been
nice to me on social media yeah I met
her in person she gave me like four hugs
she is like a fantastic hugger and you
know what's really funny ish I'm like
four days older than her something like
that we're almost the exact same age
Brandi says yay I like the look of it
but just can't find anything solid about
I'm sure it's because it has been out
for a minute but the color speak to me
on pretty basic with my colors I'm not
sure Brandi which one you're talking
about I'm not sure and says where's live
live from live loves her makeup I don't
know where live is I hopefully she's
doing well I haven't talked to her in a
while Jessica Braun yeah I'm a girl my
girl my girls having a baby I'm very
excited for Jessica she's gonna be an
amazing mom all right let's see what we
got going on in this one let me see if I
can grab brow bone shade Oh nope can't
grab a brow bone change no brow bone
shade in do I might have something in
another one of these things actually
here we go this is what we're gonna do a
sleek makeup this is the cream contour
kit and we're going to go into this
light shade right here and I'm going to
use this color pop it's like a flat
brush I'm gonna use this to highlight
the brow bone I bought a bunch of stuff
from sleek makeup and then never use it
it's like what happened why Jen why did
you buy it if you weren't gonna use it I
don't know because I thought I was gonna
use it at the time but I didn't and that
actually worked quite well what has your
experience been with sleek
make up because mine has been a little
bit underwhelming I was very sad because
I was hoping it was going to be amazing
Gina says what's wrong with clapping
with Jen loves reviews wink wink I do
not like to promote myself in that
direction I have stuff all over my shirt
I'm realizing this and candy and I do
very very different videos so I wouldn't
expect her to do any kind of
collaboration with me just because her
videos are so different my my thing when
I collect want to collaborate with
somebody I like to collaborate with
people that are do similar things to me
like Stephanie Nicole when I did the
collaboration with her you know our
videos are very similar in lots of ways
Jenny says ain't nothing wrong with
collaborating with Jen Lowe's reviews
that's true
Elyse says sleek is pretty great I buy
stuff I don't use all the time and then
declutter and my friends think I'm crazy
nice Samantha says I bought my first
sleek palette this week I'm excited to
try it very cool and Julie leap says
that sleek disappointed her yeah that's
kind of where I'm feeling right now is
I'm a little underwhelmed okay this is
the beauty for real eyeliner I figured I
would try a pencil eyeliner for once
because I'm I'm so addicted to my
liquids but I figured we would try this
this says twist 20 plus to propel
product okay so they're basically saying
that you need to twist it I know that's
upside down you need to twist it a bunch
of times in order to get the product to
come out oh wait hold on a minute is
this black it's got this little band on
the side what what color is this I
thought it was black oh no it's in the
shade champagne well that's not going to
work I didn't see that
all right let's propel the prod oh I
don't even need to propel the product
they're crazy look at that I could put
this on the lower lash line that'd be
pretty let's do it oh I like that kind
of brighten up the lower lash line I
like that hopefully it stays one thing I
don't like about videos like the one
that I'm doing right now is I don't know
how this is gonna last during the day I
can't recommend any of this stuff to you
but it's still fun to try stuff and kind
of get first impressions but just know
this is not
a review unless I say that I've tried it
multiple times like the brow product
that's like the third time I've used it
so for me that one's definitely gonna be
a recommend but like this I just opened
for the first time I need to find
another eyeliner let me see what do we
got here oh you know what I have an
eyeliner hold on hold on hold on I've
got one here we go what is this
okay here we go this is one that
Clinique sent me to stuff let me tell
you the story about clinic this is kind
of funny so we got a hold of whatsapp
and makeup we got a hold of a picture of
a collection from Clinique that was
still under embargo like you're not they
have like these like you're supposed to
people are supposed to sign like
non-disclosures that they're not gonna
like show products that aren't ready to
be exposed yet or whatever you know how
that goes where you know they're
supposed to be released at a certain
time well somehow we got a hold of a
picture didn't realize that it was a
product we weren't supposed to be
showing yet showed it in a makeup minute
and Clinique contacted me within like I
don't know 30 minutes of when the video
went live and they were like can you
please take that video down because that
is not supposed to be shown yet can you
please stay down I was like yeah
absolutely so I took the video down
immediately I reloaded it i re added it
and it uploaded it and it was gone and
we did not do anything like we cuz we're
very very serious about that with what's
the makeup we do not like to expose
things before before the brand wants
them to be exposed so if we do that it's
all like that was the only time I think
we've done that I'm actually 100% sure
that's the only time we've done that
that it wasn't anywhere else and we
thought we just had a scoop on it we
didn't realize it was still under
embargo but anyway so Clinique they sent
me a bunch of stuff as a thank you to
for taking it down so quickly so this
was one of the things they sent me this
is the Clinique pretty easy liquid
eyeliner pen and let's go ahead and try
this I was going to use a Steph says at
least you're not like trend mood I have
no comment I think that she is very very
successful for a reason she's a very
hard worker and I'll just repeat again
I'm not a fan of when
anybody leaks something before the brand
wants it to because I see that as being
very self-serving
that's just my opinion but I definitely
would say that you that she is a very
hard worker and she deserves to have a
lot of followers will just say that but
anyway just because she's such a hard
worker and she puts out I mean she puts
out constant content and she's a number
one source for a lot of people alright
let's go ahead and go into the clinic oh
that's going on very easily it is a
brush tip it's going went on very very
easily I'm not gonna do a wing because I
can't do a wing one-handed and my light
went off but yeah Michelle says thought
that was so awesome of cleaning to send
out a thank-you package instead in
getting torque yeah absolutely yeah and
I thought that was very nice of them to
and I think that if I had reacted
differently things would have been
different but I was like oh my gosh I'm
so sorry and I got rid of it right away
as fast as I could
all right
I already see a lot of fallout right
here that might have just been my
application method but I'm already
seeing some fallout down here alright
lemme where'd my top go there's my top
so this one I'm very very smoothly it's
very very black it's definitely gotten
more of a shiny finish which I
personally really like so I'm very happy
to see that so I'll have to use this
more and we'll see if it's smudging
because I don't know if it's smudgy let
me put it on my hand and we're gonna see
whether it's smudging I'm gonna let it
dry for a minute kind of kind of new
here says what is this trend mood that
you're talking about Jen Lowe's reviews
is my source oh well you know what I
mean I think that there's nothing wrong
with looking at multiple sources I mean
I think Tim Talia is amazing that's one
of my favorite sources of information
Janice says I like Clinique however they
overpriced most things yeah I can
definitely see that all right this here
is the note long lash mascara and this
was definitely given to me at a
generation B I've gotten a bunch of
stuff from Note and I haven't really
been a fan of the stuff which makes me a
little sad cuz I'm always hoping for new
brands to do well the packaging reminds
me of drugstore packaging but I'm pretty
sure this is not drugstore prices and
I'm looking at this and it just looks
very very very dry and I'm a little bit
concerned about this I may have to use a
different mascara because it looks
really dry oh my gosh this is not good
I'm very sad about this like it is
barely coloring my lashes no volume no
length let me see if I can zip back in
and get more product this is this is bad
this is not good I would never suggest
that a high-end brand used packaging
like this because it automatically makes
me think drugstore and this this product
is very dry maybe I got a bad one I
don't know but this is this will be
really really good for someone that just
wants very subtly to change their lashes
because I can see that it is on my
lashes but I like something more
dramatic so this is definitely not for
me I'm actually gonna throw this away
which makes me sad because I have no use
for a mascara you see I can show you
like it just barely colored my lashes no
volume no length which makes me really
sad Mon 4:20 love Beauty says she
swatches things on camera she is at the
party she goes and as soon as she gets
the stuff she opens all of them on
Instagram and shows everything yes
and she's really good at that I mean she
is dedicated absolutely dedicated that
makes me really sad okay let me see if I
have any other mascaras that I can use
oh here we go let's use this this is
from boxycharm this is the Tarte hardest
mascara that I just got from boxycharm
amber says I've been using the clinic
skincare for like nine years but hard
pass on their makeup gotcha and you know
I I really like their lipsticks that
they sent they sent some regular
lipsticks and I do like those but it's
not like you know blow me away or
anything Megan says note is high-end I
think so I can't I can't say that for
100% but I'm pretty sure and I'm hoping
that this TARDIS mascara lives up to
what I remember it to be because I built
it up in the boxycharm video and I use
it one other time and I was like mmm I
remember it being better than this
and right now it is not doing very much
because if this fails that boxycharm is
going to fail because this was my major
number one thing
oh hey cauliflower says best mascara
from tart is that one okay well I'm not
really impressed so far
yeah this is not being very impressed oh
there we go I got a little volume okay
there we go it's getting a little better
maybe it's one of those that just needs
to I don't know needs to be be used a
few times before it's good the other one
was just so incredibly dry Abby says
your favorite brand of 2017 I do have an
entire video that we did on favorite
brands favorite brands and brands I that
I recommend in 2018 and brands that I
want to try in 2018 I believe it was
chat two weeks ago but I will tell you I
would say colored rain and dose of
colors are definitely my favorites of
this year okay so we need to layer this
chart mascara up because now it's
starting to look good but it's
definitely taking some work but now it's
really looking good I'll show you a
close-up in just a second so you can see
let me just put one more layer on the
other side kind of new hair says I like
the Bott bronzer from boxycharm is
December box did I use that one yet I
think I did
I used the highlighter I don't think I
used the bronzer yet Caroline says my
favorite mascaras lights camera lashes I
really like that one too all right let's
just put one more layer here and then
we'll try to do a little close-up so you
can see my lashes no fake lashes for me
today okay and then we have lip products
I have some exciting lip products to
show you in a second all right let's get
up close so I think it did a pretty good
job it just took some work to get it
built up but I am very happy with it I
think it came out really good okay let's
see I just realized my eyeliner is wonky
totally wonky my eyeliner looks like
doodoo on the close-up it's like Jan
your eyeliner looks crazy
it didn't look crazy to me hold on a
minute I can't do this with one hand all
right where's gonna let the eyeliner go
because I can't fix it with one hand I
can't do it I cannot actually I'll just
move my coffee over and I'll fix it over
here because it looks terrible
oh my gosh holy moly that was bad okay
let's fix that and the close-up oh my
gosh that looks so bad oh that still
looks bad all right I'm gonna have to
fix that off-camera I'm not gonna spend
forever on that all right one thing I do
want to do is I do want to put a little
bit of shadow on my lower lash line
let's get this pinky rows back out not
that one this one Jenna says how is the
Clinic foundation that has the doe foot
I love full coverage I don't know that's
a good question
yes and yet how you send your Cuevas how
are you I'll stick to my superhero
mascara you know that one didn't work
very well for me which is crazy because
I know it works for a lot of people
let's go ahead and go into this green
here this grunge Shay because I did not
use that we're using the roller wheel I
didn't even do that on purpose the woosh
woosh Beauty roller wheel that was
terrible but the brush isn't bad I'm
just gonna put a little bit of this on
the lower lash line oh that's pretty I
like that that looks really pretty there
you go look how pretty that looks
doll face says that she loves that
foundation nice Juliana says hi Jen and
my opinion too much work for mascara I
am with you
Heber says I love love love perversion
by urban decay that is a good one too
totally with you but I do like that
green there that really made the whole
look really pop I like that I like that
a lot
okay so let's go into lips to lips next
so I got a bunch of these my friend
Julia Salvia had a party at generation
beauty and she got she had pinky swear
was there I know I've got pinky rose and
pinky swear but this is called a clip
paint cream lip pigment and this is in
the shade send nudes click it paint lips
and click it it's like a little pen
isn't that cute and they gave us a bunch
of these but they're all really really
bold and wild colors colors that I won't
wear this is the only one that I think
that I will actually wear
it's got a brush thing here oh it's like
got dust coming off of it it's really
odd okay well we're gonna keep going
anyway we're gonna use it and then I
have something else I'm going to show
you after this but just got this it's
very cute I just gotta get the product
out nee nee nee nee nee nee rachel says
I got an A action from the superhero
mascara oh my gosh
I will never forget I've told the story
every time I talk about superhero
mascara I gotta tell the story that when
I met Kristin game for the first time
she was wearing the superhero mascara
and I swore that she was wearing fake
lashes it looked so good on her and then
I got it myself and I was like mmm
didn't work for me Isabelle wants to
know thoughts on the visi art grande Pro
vol 1 palette I stuck my fingers in it
it stuck me the goals outs it seemed
very very nice but I don't own it this
stuff is really thick it smells good it
smells like candy it's definitely too
much product I think I over clicked
maybe I can spread some out it's a very
paint like I don't know if I like this
no no it's fine
spread it out it weird it feels very
thick and heavy but am i I might have
just applied too much product no no what
do you think it's a little I don't know
let's let that dry and see how that goes
and then I have another product I'll
show you that I'm really excited about
that I hope to put over top of this Jen
what mirror is this this mirror is by
simple human and I suggest you get it
from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond with a 20% off
coupon because it is pricey but this
mirror has been a game changer for me it
is amazing I was talking about this in
the getting ready with me for what's the
makeup to do a video on like gadgets and
things like things that I use that are
like worth the investment this would
definitely be one of them as the
lighting mirrors I've used in the past
like they just they just light up but
they don't light up my face you know
like it's almost like there's lights and
then the mirror is in the shadow and
then Mike I can't see my face any better
because of the light you know what I
mean
Deanna says it needs a lip liner yeah
definitely I mean it's very nude looking
it looks even more washed out on camera
than it does in person in person it
looks more a peek like a like a little
bit darker of a peach but for some
reason it is really washed out they're
really washed out so let's go ahead and
I had it back up we're gonna layer this
over top it still feels very heavy this
is by M cosmetics and this is the shade
muted mall and I will tell you that this
is nearly the exact same formula as the
bare minerals gen nudes and now I'm
thinking that this is not going to look
good because I've got this peachy eye I
don't know let's mix it let's just see
what happens we're just having fun here
mmm I might just have to start over this
is not working okay apparently these
formulas do not like each other they're
not blending at all
I don't like it I don't like it I don't
like it at all
let me show you what I was going to show
you we're gonna switch up the lip
product Oh before we do that let's try
to wipe this okay so we've got a little
bit of smudging on the eyeliner but not
so bad
not so bad oh Emily likes my lip color I
don't know I don't know if I'll like it
ah oh no I think it's a little too light
I don't even know okay this is what
we're gonna do hold on let's layer
something else okay let's since we were
talking about Clinique let's do one of
these Clinique this is called pow pop
this is one of their lipsticks it's a
deep berry so let's try that
holy Olli
we got a concoction going on I don't
know about this either because we got
like peach and we got green and we got
purple I look like a clown like this
either
I don't like it Gigi doesn't like it
either I don't like it either it's going
away all right hold on it's terrible
it's terrible I don't like it
it's not good all right oh my goodness
when we have 9 minutes left
all right this is bad
Sorry Sorry over abort mission
I have so much glitter fallout right
here it's looks terrible
I'm gonna have to fix that I don't think
my neck face looks as bad as it once did
all right
I don't know what I'm gonna do with my
lips but the other product I wanted to
show you I bought this and it's still in
the secret box
this is the Too Faced melted latex in
unicorn tears and I haven't even tried
it yet how crazy is it it got like it
got buried so let me just show you real
quick what it looks like without
anything on just because I want to show
you it's weird but it's fun
isn't that fun not with this look but
it's still fun I feel like I'm out of
like an 80s like music video like a
prince video or something isn't it weird
it's so weird but I like it with the
right look I think it's gonna look good
not with this though and this is this is
mm-hmm it's very heavy it's very glossy
it's not sticky but it's very heavy it's
fun it's fun we're gonna take this off
too though I have this towel is so
disgusting I need a new one I have clean
ones under here let's get rid of this
one that one's gonna go in the laundry
as soon as I'm done with Chad oh I'm
Juliana says this chief a slate extra
sticky City mine I'm not sticky it's
just heavy doesn't there not my lips
aren't sticking together yes Jenny says
battlestar galactica yeah that's exactly
what I'm talking about
Amanda says it looks like you had a blue
Slurpee I know right yeah as a topper
exactly Gigi as a topper alright well I
don't even know what to do now at this
point with lips I don't even know let's
abandon the lips for a bit and let's go
ahead into cheeks so this was sent to me
by Etsy this was a collaboration with I
can picture her face I'm trying to
remember her name oh my gosh this is
terrible she's gonna be so mad at me I
can't remember our name went out of my
head but anyway this was a collaboration
with Etsy I should have had it in my
head before I started filming but but
yeah I really like these these are very
very nice I think that they were quite
pricey considering they're in a magnetic
palette they're not set into the palette
you know I thought that they were really
pricey but they are really good quality
so I'm gonna use this blush right here
this is in the shade hashtag girl boss
I'm gonna use that I'm gonna use the
brush from crown brush that came in
boxycharm and let's just go ahead and do
that I do have plenty of other Natalie
says touch of spice Jen do it I have
touch of spice I know exactly where
touch of spice is it's like my go-to
that looks so pretty with this I look
looks really really pretty it's got a
little bit of a satin Sheen to it but
there's no glitter unlike the fallout
all over my face
from this other product just as a mental
note to myself and some others the my
face now you can see every single pore
on my face right now from this I don't
know if you can tell but I can totally
see every single pore it does not make
my face look pretty at all I feel like I
can see everything it's not pretty
alright let's go ahead and use the
highlighter from here I'm going to use
this one right here this is from Angie
wants to know Jen can you recommend a
foil palette for foiled shadows my
favorite are the Juvia splay shadows but
it's not all foiled the coloured raine
ones are really really good as well
those are great foiled shadows but
they're not of course they're all
they're not all they're not the whole
palate isn't foiled but this thing the
singles from coloured raine are amazing
I haven't tried I don't think you vyas
place make singles but both of those I
would say are the best foiled eyeshadows
I've ever tried this is called gold
digger and we're gonna use this as
highlighter and I forgot to bring my
highlighter brush over here mmm
do I have one close by that I can use
kind of sort of let's see I thought I
brought a brush over here for
highlighting oh I did here we go this
one right here this is a modem metallic
brush motor does not get enough love
they're so good
even though I have so much glitter on my
face I probably don't even need a
highlighter but man look at that BAM
that's like nikkietutorials glow right
there that's crazy
how fun I like pop and highlighters like
from space highlighters they are so
popping and glowy oh my gosh I love it
some people think it's too much but I
think it looks really really pretty it
goes with my space lips from earlier and
then I was gonna use this for contour
I'm just gonna use this with my
fingertips like I have a stippling brush
ever there but I think I'm just use my
fingertips for this this right here this
contour shade is the one I'm gonna use
and I'm just gonna stripe it down and
blend it in
do I have a mirror in here yes I do
we're just gonna go boom what looks like
poop
it looks like straight-up baby poop that
is some baby poop goodness right there
hmm it looks like baby poop still looks
like baby poop not as bad smoothed out
baby poop it looks like dirt I hate it I
hate it all right well we got to do the
other side we can't just let it go it's
got to blend it out and hopefully hope
for the best I will not be using this
again I will try to pass this on though
that is not blending into the skin very
nicely it looks very patchy and baby
poopy oh my gosh that looks horrible it
looks terrible I don't know if you can
see how patchy that is but it looks
awful
maybe it's my application technique
maybe I need to use it with a brush
maybe that'll be better okay I'm gonna
give it another try at another point
with a brush but Oh Jen is leaving bye
Jenna oh so good to have you here okay
so for lips we need something peachy for
lips what should we do for lips
let's do okay this is what well no
that's kind of lame okay this is what
we're gonna do I've used this on camera
before well no that's not gonna be good
oh here we go
let's use this this might be too
metallic Oh see I tried to use this for
what's up and makeup but it was too
light maybe we need to do a lip liner
let's do a lip liner let's - Oh probably
not redress probably not the best idea
you have a peachy lip liner like a
darker peach check this one this one
will probably work I think I got this in
a mystery box or something - this is the
Laura Mercier Naked lip liner where did
I get this maybe I got in a subscription
box I don't know I'm not sure but let's
go ahead and do lip liner and then we'll
do this over top and hopefully that
helps with it being a little bit darker
oh my gosh I only have one minute left
ah gojenngo
gojenngo oh my gosh I saw glitter all
over my lips oh well we're just gonna
keep going you know makeup is supposed
to be fun you all think it's so
seriously like if things aren't perfect
people like freak out that's like dude
it's just makeup man all right this is
not doing what I expected it to do I
don't know
I'm also not being super careful with it
either cuz it's such a nude shade I know
I'm not applying it perfectly that's
what this is all about okay here we go
let's try this Tama says I've been
watching you for years Jen first time in
live chat oh thank you so much for being
here hopefully I said your name right I
probably didn't if I didn't I'm sorry
that's pretty I've learned that this
does not dry down this is the pretty
vulgar liquid lipstick in the shade what
did we say this was this is in my lips
are sealed
secret sabotage and it's still very
light it looks very washed out on camera
but it does not look as bad in person so
I'm gonna try to keep it even though on
camera I know that it looks kind of
washed out because it does look good in
person so I think I'm gonna keep it and
plus I'm out of time so kind of new here
says you're not having good time with
lips today I honestly have a secret to
share with you
lips are my least favorite thing to do
they're what I need the most help with
I'm really bad with picking out lipstick
really really bad actually you know what
let's try to deepen it just a little bit
I'm gonna grab a brown and see if I can
just deepen it just a little bit hold on
a second so I just saw this brown across
the way hold on a second where did it go
I want my dose of colors the dark
chocolate one what is it chocolate
wasted I want that but I don't see that
I see it
oh I know I'm not there but at least I
have my microphone on so you can hear me
like going through my drawer and trying
to find things I know I have a brown
hair log of ugh this is the the fail of
being live is that you like
I can't edit this out or else I totally
would I want my chocolate wasted cuz I
all the Browns I see they're all light
Browns okay well what is this
that's truffle that's too light goodness
gracious I'm sorry
it's a livestream fail it's a fail I
want like a dark brown
how many lipsticks you have Jen you
can't find a dark brown oh here we go
this might work okay so this one this is
the lip tar an artifact by OCC maybe
this will deepen it up just a little bit
I don't know
there we go I've really been digging
these OCC lip tars lately I like that I
do like that I don't like that my face
is yellow we're gonna do one more thing
I know that I'm well over time I'm two
minutes over time I do need some face
powder so let's do some finishing powder
and I had gotten this and I never used
it this is the cover effects perfect
setting powder and I was again this was
given to me at generation beauty and I
never used it so let's go ahead and try
this I'm excited to try it because I
have my favorites oh I like the cap it's
like the toothpaste cap I like that okay
okay what I usually do with these is
I'll tap some product into the cap here
and then I'll put the product in the
brush in and then tap it off and get the
excess off I don't know if it's right or
not or what but that's what I do I maybe
will try to maybe this will lighten it
up a little bit make me less oompa
loompa I am never going to use that BB
cream again I'm gonna have to see if I
can pass it on to someone that's more
warm toned I'm not sure about this cover
FX powder oh no it seems nice and now
I'm using a fluffy brush with this I
like to try both a fluffy brush and a
stiff brush with setting powder I think
that looks nice I think it looks better
I'm still a little Oompa Loompa e but
you know Who am I trying to impress
nobody nobody nobody so if I'm a little
I'm a little yellow oh well it is what
it is
who is that I miss it Oh
oh darn it cauliflower says the
Maybelline fit me powder is amazing too
I have not tried that one I have not
tried that one okay so look is finished
I like it overall
hopefully it was fun for you to see some
of these products on camera I would love
to do this again because I do have other
products that would love to show you I
had
picking out these products because I do
have quite a few that I'd love to show
you and I think that live chat would be
a great way for me to show you some of
these products and try out new things
because I feel like a lot of times I
talk about the same products over and
over again because I get in my thing
where I really really like something and
I do it a lot so it will be nice to show
some lesser-known lesser shown on
YouTube products and maybe discover
something different and new that we will
all love and enjoy jessica says you made
it work Jen I tried I tried the only
thing I really am hating is my neck face
that I have but could work through it
work through it it'll be fine I'll be
good so thank you so so much for being
here I appreciate it happy New Year to
you I will see you in the new year next
week we have my color range here's a
beauty review and also my best products
of 2017 that video is already filmed and
then hopefully I'll be able to get a
third video for you as well kids are
going back to school so I'm hoping that
Wednesday I'll be able to film and get
another video up for you on Friday so
I'm hoping to get back to my Monday
Wednesday Friday schedule crossing my
fingers I may have to change it just to
Tuesday Thursday depending on how things
go I hate having a schedule because I
like to put up more if I can but I don't
like like if I want to make a video
really really good I don't like to have
to you know stop you know and not make
it as good just so I can stay on the
schedule you know what I mean I think
quality is way more important than
trying to push a video before it's ready
so anyway thank you so much for being
here happy New Year to you and mad love
to you if you're watching this on the
replay I would love for you to leave a
comment about what you thought about the
livestream and anything you saw here
anything that you're interested in
anything you've already tried I'd love
to hear your point of view and love and
I will see you in a video very very soon
