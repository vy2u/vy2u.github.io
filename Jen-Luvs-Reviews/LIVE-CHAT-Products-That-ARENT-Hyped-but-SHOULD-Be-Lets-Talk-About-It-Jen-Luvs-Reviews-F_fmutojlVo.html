good morning Danny glad that you're able
to hear and comment that makes me so
happy alright so let's go ahead and
let's go ahead and start talking about
things that are worth the hype but do
not get the hype let me just click over
to my view make sure that I look okay
I'm in frame you can see everything
we're good alright so the first thing I
want to start talking about those
primers now I only have one primer that
I feel like doesn't get behind I have a
lot of products that are really really
good but a lot of them already hyped up
you already know about those this is one
that no one talks about this is the step
one eye primer by Coastal Scents the
stuff section really good I will compare
this to the Urban Decay primer potion in
its feel and texture and you know use
it's got that creamy peachy kind of skin
tone color and then it blends away into
nothing it feels the same as the Urban
Decay it does very very well I think
it's maybe a little bit oilier than the
Urban Decay so if you have dry lids you
might really like this one I'm
I have normal skin it works great for me
it makes me super super super happy I'm
so excited you're here at viva la juicy
03 all right drinking a little more
comfy then we're coming if you're in the
collective bring it over here make sure
you're starting to type in some things
you think should be get some height that
don't all right let's go to let's do
some makeup brushes I talk about these
all the time no one ever talks about
these these are the outer beauty brushes
the company is called outer beauty and
they have a face brush set and then they
have I forgot the other ones cold but
it's not an eyebrow said it's like a
definer set or something like that on
the face brush that I like better I feel
like it's more useful but these are
amazing brushes they remind me of my it
cosmetics brushes I just ordered a bunch
of Sigma brushes so I'm curious to
compare these to those super dense no
shedding I'm just really easy to use and
there they're relatively inexpensive if
you get the set you're going to get them
at about ten dollars a brush which is
really good for this high quality of a
brush and then this one I use for
concealing us came out of the finer set
really really love these YouTube they
don't advertise on YouTube they're
always at IMATS and a lot of the beauty
events but they're an amazing amazing
brush sets good morning k good to see
you and Nikki wants to know if anyone
got the urban decay and Gwen palette I'm
think I'm gonna skip that one even
though it does look pretty cool at least
that I said before but the knicks h2o
proof I primer is awesome I did not know
that that's very good to know Maddie
says the Rimmel wake me up concealer is
oddly awesome very cool glad to know
about that Helen says I guess I have to
break down and check out outer beauty it
really is good if you go to Cassie from
thrift thick I made her buy some of
their brushes and she loves them too I'm
if you're in the American market for
some brushes if you're not mark for
brushes you'll need them but if you are
in the market for brushes they're pretty
fab they're pretty fab hello Becca nikki
says L smudge pots are not talked about
too much i would say ofra but now they
get a ton of attention the clinic pop
line that needs to get more attention as
well stephanie says i want the new wet
palette but she's unsure let's see
sephora liquid lipsticks by krista she
says Oh liquid liners never hear them
talk about them they're so
use i guess you stop at the liquid
eyeliners Madison says the r-mo Kate
Moss lipsticks and Ecotools brush is
never at the love they deserve I
completely agree with you Madison 100
the zillion percent definitely the r-mo
just a rumor lipsticks in general and
ecotools brushes totally agree some of
the eco tools face brushes leave a
little to be desired but the eye brush
set is phenomenal I'm going to try not
to say phenomenal too much because it's
saying that we're going too much lately
yeah Lori said the office much pots are
awesome all right sandra says Nikki
agree about the smudge pots don't take
don't take them out enough all right I'm
gonna parlay with the calm and it's a
another product that doesn't get enough
height this is the first eyebrow pencil
that I ever use this is a company called
YBF more best friend and this is the
automatic eyebrow pencil in Universal
taupe this is a fantastic wonderful I
should have looked up synonyms before I
started this video I pencil it is in
Universal taupe and I really do feel
like it's universal I've used this what
my hair is lighter I've used it with my
hair darker and I do feel like the more
you press on it the darker it gets so
you can do it really light we see if I
can get um so you can see when you do it
really light you can get kind of a
blondish color but then when you do a
darker you can get like that deep
brunette color and it's really nice I
mean just it's probably the best eye
pencil for shade that I've ever seen and
it is it is a little tougher to go on
meaning you have to work a little harder
it's definitely not creamy in any way
I'm which is good for brows because you
don't want your brows being all creamy
actually what up you know what I forgot
that I had planned ahead for this I
wanted to do my brows with this really
quickly for you let me switch over I'm
not sponsored hashtag not sponsored
stuff um I am not sponsored they don't
know that I'm making this video I bought
this on who look like this is just weeks
let me in here I'm trying to do it in
the camera view you just kind of do my
brows work with and show you how awesome
the sprint up red pencil is and then
we'll do the Anasazi on the other side
just so you can see look fast BAM done
and all right let's do i sogni on the
other side does he compare some real
quick where's my oh
I lost my hardest hacia where did you go
ok well im using oh you know why because
i used it in my getting ready with me
thing in this file yes wild all right
it's lost in this one right it's lost
somewhere in here if i can find it
quickly because i wasn't planning on
doing that until just a moment ago and I
was like you don't want to put on a
Stassi on the other side but it's like a
stupidly thin pencil so should be able
to find it quickly but obviously I can't
okay we're gonna have to use it
cosmetics on the other side because I
can't find it for Klingon watch all the
house all right in cosmetics on the
other side thankfully this doesn't take
very long okay there you go brows done
so this YBF no one talks about no one
talks about it i think the should
fantastic casa I'll swatch this one next
to it the it cosmetics one this is the
it cosmetics one so it's very similar so
then get that deep look almost exactly
the same I think the it cosmetic one it
looks like it almost sounds a tinge of
green and it done it it's very similar
very similar so if you're having to see
that on hautelook definitely recommend
it's awesome I'm going to switch off the
camera view I'm going to go ahead back
to hey this is the YBF boo boo check out
some more comments on some products that
are worth the hype but don't get it
everyone's agreeing about those of
smudge pots alright caitlin says wet and
wild contouring duo palette is amazing i
never get anyone talk about it i only
found that walmart that's good to know
I've never tried the contour into
account I do really like the square one
this contouring palette you could only
get online and I believe this is one of
this I'm gonna say it it's my Holy Grail
as my Holy Grail contour palette right
here I'm gonna say it the elf I got this
one I got this one not this one this
one's my favorite
getting I'm not exaggerating I'm not
just seeing oh not this one say but no
you know what I think having a quad
giving out for run for their money but
this is the only one that I think
competes with this this one this is ten
dollars this is fifty or sixty dollars
mm-hmm all right moving on moving on hey
all right let's see boom pancake says i
love the honeybee gardens truly natural
lipstick very moisturizing actually has
decent staying power that's awesome
floor he wants the word palette to
everybody wants to glencoe I watched the
review on the Glen palette by xsparkage
and I really enjoyed the review of it
she said that she feels like it was
meant for people of when skin color
because of the shade range that they
chose so be aware of that if you look at
you can kind of see there's a lot of
light colors in there a lot Leslie says
ego to it was brushes shed bad I haven't
found that to be true about the eye
brushes abut I what I was saying about
the face brushes face brushes are kind
of the eye brushes are good Becca says I
feel like Alton's of course to our
brands are not talked about enough agree
Murray don't have any holds a brain
stuff no why didn't remember you got any
older funny sephora is up you know I've
heard bad things about the autograph
really bad things but there's some
really good for brand products like
putting handle this that um my friend
Gayle sent me I love this blush this is
the colorful blush in shame on you and
it's a wonderful blush it's wonderful
love it totally agree on that also
support liquid lipsticks they were
really really hyped up when they first
came out and then you stopped hearing
about them they're wonderful let's see I

one all right let's
about a couple more things is 1016 all
right let's get into I shadow no yes I
shadow okay products that do not get
enough height these books and palettes I
don't know if you guys have heard much
about these but I know I haven't I got
these with FC points when they um they
had like an FC point deal these things
are amazing with Android and I went
shopping I may forget and I may forget I
encouraged her to get some of the UM the
little pants this one here is amazing
it's beautiful just gorgeous and it
shows up true purple I've heard some
people have some difficulty with the
mats in Europe I haven't had that
experience let me show you this one this
purple too is very unique I don't have
the names i can i can go on and get the
names but that purple that duochrome
that duochrome though oh my goodness oh
my goodness break my heart oh love it I
love it I can tell you what the names
are so what happens here is you load
these babies up like so this one is
called la Llana lavish they have the
names on the back here this gold oh this
gold is gold let me show you this gold
it's called gold status oh lord thank
you for this palette all right here we
go right there BAM mmm I love it I love
it I love it ok so anyway yes totally
worth the hype very creamy very
blendable very amazing no one talks
about these I love them I love them
other eye shadow palettes no one tom s
offense i'm going to show you this one
this is the diva makeup queen dream big
palette diva makeup queen is wing she is
a youtuber who made her own eyeshadow
palette this thing is so awesome it's so
awesome oh my gosh so awesome so it's
got this mirror here and it says looking
good gorgeous anything is possible all
you have to do is dream and she had a
dream to make an eyeshadow palette and
she did he's how I shadows are so good
they're so good and no one talks about
her palette and they should she is like
she was about a size youtuber you know
like not really big not really small
all like his neutral shades oh goodness
oh my goodness but now she's got close
to 100,000 subscribers just really nice
to play with really nice to play with
very fun when she threw some fun colors
over on the side I'm I feel like I wish
that she had made these smaller you know
what I mean or put these I don't know I
guess she was just trying to fit the
pans and figure out how she was gonna
fit the pans in um but it's like I feel
they don't really need this much color
of the coach shadows I almost wish that
I had more of the neutral shade and less
of the color or you know made the pants
more like I don't know if she could have
made these pans over here and made that
fit I don't know but mmm it's amazing
palette really nice quality really nice
quality all right and then oh yeah can't
go through this without talking about
the elfin eat at nude palette health me
a nude palette amazing amazing eyeshadow
palette my only reason why Oh what just
happened are you serious I'm writing
about break on me what is wrong with you
maybe a cat got camera shy got a little
performance anxiety here I'm just so far
oh okay topic in there baby the old
backwards I get oh my gosh okay all
right anyway so coffee after that one so
anyway this is an amazing talent it's
amazing it is so pigmented it is so easy
to blend the only reason why I would
would not recommend this over and urban
decay naked palette is that you're gonna
get more looks with an urban decay naked
palette rather than this this this
doesn't provide quite as many looks but
I feel like the quality is the same I
really do I have a whole video on all of
these elf palettes and the like that
whole release for the least amount of
new stuff just online I have a whole
video about those with all swatches and
all that stuff if you're interested in
these but oh my gosh this one this one
right here and this from right here I
love these shimmery metallic shades
they're like life for me can you believe
those are elf and that's the way they
look on eyes to look no joke that's not
that's not just a finger swatch that's
what it looks like on eyes they're just
amazing and
I think I run this palette is really
good the other palettes feel like the
lasting power isn't as good as it is
with this one but they're all good the
party ready is my least favorite um
those just give you a submarine so now
that I've gabbed on for about five
minutes let's read some more comments 0
Tabitha says go I finally made it huh
happy early holidays happy early
holidays to you my friend tab has been a
subscriber mine for a really long time
that's different then you can call me
tab this is which mom Davis who was also
Tabitha I know it gets confusing Linda
says oh I already read that already read
Linda's comment all right Nicki says I
actually like the Knicks more than
anastacio Beverly Hills when I think
she's talking about the the brow pencil
maybe cuz I know Nikki stephanie says i
love the wet n wild fergie eye primer
I've heard people love that it doesn't
work very well for me but everyone
argues with me I think that I'm in the
minority and you're the majority
Stephanie Alvarado alright KJ um Jen
tattoo video how he needs to do a tattoo
video we should we should I'm echoing oh
no I have my microphone microphone that
I bosses Italy when this purpose and my
connection snapped so I can't use it
anymore because it's broken so I need to
get a new cord for my microphone sorry
if I'm not going I apologize I wish
there's something else I could do about
it i did buy microphone for it actually
get a new one I'm sorry um fizzy pop I
stayed up until three to get the Glen
palette i'm surprised i woke up early
enough to make the chat i'm so glad that
you're here i'm glad you got the Glen
palette I'm glad that you're happy that
makes me happy one thing you can do to
is bump up the quality sometimes that
helps with the echo in the background
sorry about that um Helen says awesome
caddy Jen oh this thing this thing I got
in the office supply section at
marshalls it's like oh so speed for like
pencils i use it for makeup all right
hmm but thank you very much helen and
stephanie a says my lids never crease
and i know it's bad to sleep in your
makeup but i'm not going to lie i've
done at a time or two of my shadow stay
on over tonight oh my goodness that's
the the fergie wet and wild one wait
crazy crazy pilot says when does the
Gwen's how it came out I believe it came
out this morning
I believe I believe Becca says Milani
has great brow products to that's good
to know i haven't tried any of those
Linda says I like rimmel's eyebrow
pencil awesome fizzy pop says I was so
scared I wouldn't get one of the Gwen's
how and I'm so glad you were able to
Mariano says I'm not sure how much this
eyeliner is hype but I personally have
not heard much about the in color fabula
nor liquid eyeliner it's amazing it's
only 299 I've never heard of that I be
talking about the UM the Jordana fabula
nor I know the Jordana one the Jordan
Vienna one I was not a fan of to be
completely honest it seeped into my fine
lines it's too sharp you like it doesn't
bend it was not my favorite but I can
see where it would work for someone that
has more tartlets than me and someone
adds a little more patience than me
because once it got on it was great it's
just not my favorite one the Jordana
fabula at fab you later I don't know the
in color fake ID liner but that's good
to know let me know where you got that
but you know telling it make sure you
say I got the in color fabula nor at so
that I know what you're talking about
because it's probably gonna be a few
minutes from now before I see it Tabitha
says I want the web palette but just
just bought the self-made and don't need
both that's good to know Jean says the
Milani eye primer could be a dick for
Smashbox 24-hour primer that is great to
know I have tried the Milani eye primer
I do not have it I lost it something
happened to it when i moved i don't have
it anymore I need to get another one
just to have it for comparison purposes
Arlene says I have a Milani eyebrow
pencil it works well that's good to know
I'm about to lose yup I had to scroll
down so I got to scroll back up okay
oh you guys put so many comments oh my
goodness I'm so far behind holy moly
okay there's this sephora brand one I
going on I found you guys takes me a
minute there is the in color okay
wet'n'wild contour hard to find the
contour palette I haven't tried the wet
and wild contour I've only tried the elf
one the f1 is amazing the eyeliner is
Jordana okay cool yes and I think if
you're good at eyeliner and you don't me
up like you know nice really young not
like nice twat legs you're good it's
just I didn't like that it seeped in my
fine lines um KJ says kevin is the
master contour dude yeah Kevin a cool
one uh-huh good morning to lisa elise
said I just saw new formula on the wet
walk on four pallets at walmart on
friday ooh that's interesting i am
intrigued mmm aaron says a lot of
essence products are really good that is
so so true and that leads me into
mascaras speaking of essence I have two
essence mascaras and both of these are
amazing mascaras they make me so super
happy this is the essence lush flash
princess lash lash effect mascara and
this is the i heart extreme volume
mascara one day I want to put one on one
eye and one of the other saw eye to see
what's actually the difference between
these because I just know that they're
both awesome this is no princess one and
then this one is the i heart extreme
you'll see the brush is totally
different um I feel like the I Heart
extreme does thinking about it the
iheart extreme gives a little bit more
volume where this one is more even like
an even amount of length and volume this
one beefs up the volume you know what I
mean yes yes yes and the essence blushes
are really good so I just got this one
in my Ipsy swag pixie the swag bag we
got at generation beauty I got this one
they load us up with some SS products
and I'm really happy with everything I
got and there this is hashtag not
sponsor like they don't know I'm telling
you this like they don't I don't care
like I'm not affiliate them at all I
just got stuff and I tried it and I
liked it so telling me about it but the
others blush is good also
I shadows are good I'm trying to member
work with the eyeshadow i'm not sure i'm
not going to go digging for it but the
eyeshadows are also really really good
I've really been enjoying those they're
not like amazing quality but for like
drugstore brand for how cheap they are
they're really good very very good for
that price point but yes essence
mascaras do not get enough love do not
absolutely do not love um well the other
thing I primer why's that I've been
loving that doesn't get enough love and
you've been on my periscope you've seen
this I'm almost out and I'm going to cry
this is urban decay's nude Matt primer I
primer in Eden I'm not going to swatch
it because I am too in love with it to
waste a tiny bit I don't know I think
you guys are worth it though will do the
tiniest little bit because I don't have
probably any Oh too much came out that's
what i call hole i I just wasted a whole
I but you guys are worth it all right
here you show you this and you can't
even see it Oh totally totally not even

pretty much the same I have some new
products but not too many new products
um and I have reviews on all the Proxima
for the bombs i'm a huge the bomb
collector but yes they are I don't know
if they get the holotype azer I think
some channels really hype it up in some
channels don't um so I think they're

but yes they do do a really nice job on
things

the vib Russo and since then i have
bought sigma brushes i have gotten the
carli bybel talent it's on the way i
have i got some julep nail polishes i'm
not doing well i haven't bought anything
stores though oh and add one just a
friday thing and I got um I got a ton of
marc anthony shampoos and conditioner is
so in love with those and then I got
most again I can't remember what I got
because I'm not big of an addict what
did I get you know that girl my
periscope know or my Twitter probably
know what I got there is not it I can't
he remember how terrible is that like
off the top of my hands like what did i
buy and i was so excited at the time um
oh I got some to face lipsticks I
remember that and what other brand was
on sale there was another Brandon's on
sale that I bought a bunch of stuff from
I'll remember it and I'll just bust out
with it a couple minutes spring says
sephora wipe roof liner lat eyeliner
lasts on her that's awesome natie says
lorac front of the line pro liquid liner
pen it's a little pricey but awesome and
less a long time I still used to draw my
arm sooo funny lisa says I never buy all
to print anything cuz ur display is
always struc- they always looks good but
I've heard their makeup is not good
that's about right all right let's go
exist some blushes 1032 I'm starting to
run out of products here all I have left
is lip products after this but you know
we're going to some blushes this is the
polished choice blush palette I got this
on if C or one of their FC deals and
this is a wonderful wonderful blush
palette the blushes are very very
pigmented the contour and the highlight
are really nice it's kind of warm for a
contour I use it more for bronzer than a
contra because it is a little bit warm
but some people might be able to use
this as a contour a highlight is
gorgeous highlight is semi poppin I
would say it's medium poppin you know
where if you say from the kat von d all
the way to UM champagne pop as being a
10 so like the kat von d contour
highlights like completely matte be a 1
and champagne pop will be a 10 this is
like maybe a 64 poppin this is a very
pigmented blush this one is a little bit
too much for my skin tone that will
probably look better on a deeper skin
tone but I honestly really like this
orange one how weird is that it's like a
bright like corley red oh my gosh I love
it I don't know why and these other two
who are really really good too so highly
recommend that one and then the other
blushes I wanted to show you even though
they're currently discontinued are the
kat von d blushes a lot see if you saw
on the show is now releasing some of her
old school products on her Kat Von D
website if you can catch these blushes
there is an image with the blushes in it
it looks like she's going to be
releasing them the kat von d blushes are
my favorite blush formula of all time
when they come back on sale on there i'm
definitely buying some is this formula
so much this one is called essex it's my
favorite that's what i was wearing in
the show today and then this one is
called bellisima and they're both just
the formula is perfect builds
beautifully just builds very very nicely
up to just a really nice pigmentation so
definitely recommending those what are
you doing huh go get some food then long
did I come in here he's standing there
in his underwear all right I'd say I
need to see the forefinger video I need
to watch it um Shannon says for blush
duo's are beautiful that's good to know
and fleury says hi to amanda Linda says
all the lipsticks are nice their seal
which is always a must for me that's
good to know moon pancake says I gotta
support liquid lipstick
I pencil my Sephora play box and both
were amazing I want to try more support
for brand yeah sephora the liquid
lipsticks are really really good the lip
stain I haven't used as much as the
lipstick um but I mean the liquid
lipstick but I like them there's a lot
of Stephanies in here stuff lots of
Stephanies okay so did I miss anything a
multitasking girlfriend I can't even
tell you what you missed at this point I
can't even yeah I'm so like my brain is
all Wiggly locally so you know I'm not
going to tell you the whole story of why
the show went up 10 minutes late but
let's just say that was big fails in the
middle of night last night alright so I
was up I was up late because of YouTube
fails and space fails on my computer so
I'm a little bit rude today Linda says
they're talking about the Glen palette
okay yes Danny says sephora waterproof
eyeliner is amazing and her holy grail
applies to the waterline smoothly and
lasts all day I wear contacts and have
allergies and have tried them all the
way up to Marc Jacobs that is really
good are you talking about the liquid
eyeliner or Jonah the pencil eyeliner
because I agree with you the pencil
liners or so fast yawn my husband when
he was on to make up bra and he's not
really anymore when he was doing makeup
stuff because he goes through different
phases he bought us a for eyeliner set
so we own like a lot of you support
eyeliners and they're so good they're so
good I'm trying to find more colors this
one we have so many of them and they're
really good they do last in my waterline
and they're fantastic fun fun one we'll
just leave it at that these are some of
the colors these are the ones some of
the ones that I don't use like who uses
a yellow eyeliner like what I could use
this maybe it's like an eyeshadow or
something or like a pop of color on the
inner corner like like a summer look or
something but yeah I've never used this
one except for just now that's the first
time i've ever used it they're so creamy
they do the glass from the waterline
they're very very nice but regular
pencil liner have never tried any liquid
liners by sephora though but if you
think i should i will want thing I will
tell you that I don't like by sephora
brand
just use is the Sephora mascara I got a
sample of its the mascara volume this
used all over my face I haven't had a
mascara performed this badly in a really
long time and I try a lot of mascaras my
son is yelling I'm gonna close it works
my husband's downstairs a foreign kids
for me so he's being well taken care of
but we're chatting I need to be able to
focus and I can't focus I think I do
really like about this formula though
number this the packaging is that the
the brush kind of goes in like here you
see that out like dips in it's not like
doesn't pull out like typical mascaras
we're like you know you see the product
like coming out or whatever and the
brush is wonderful um but the formula
oozed all down my face by the end of the
day I love like black eyes it was
horrible it was embarrassing how badly
this mascara perform because everybody
at my work knows that i do youtube
videos so if my makeup looks terrible
they're like girlfriend like you do this
as a side job look at your makeup like
least that's what i think that they're
saying so on this actually i'm only
saving it just because to talk about how
bad it is and then it's going to go away
I'm never using it again it's never
going to go in my eyes again it's
horrible absolutely horrible but that's
the first support product I've used it a
long time that I can say is horrible
most of our products that tried have
been very good kyla says can you show
declutter going through and clean out
your makeup I have a few videos of
decluttering videos I need to do more
but if you go back so before I moved to
the summer I did I think three or four
decluttering videos I think it did three
um yeah so I did do some but I need to
do more because I need to declutter my
lip products and my eye products like my
eye pencils and stuff and my lip
products needs to happen Shannon says
you need to get that tat finished before
you can do a tattoo video I have lots of
tattoos that are not why one tattoo
that's not finished you're right and
then um I have a bunch of other ones
like seven ish so I need to just get my
tattoos worked on period but John so
busy and it's not fun to get tattooed so
I Preston eight on it this it's really a
horrible process it feels terrible so
but anyway Linda says my holy grail
water line is to prestige total
I'm sitting deep is black oh wow that's
cool that's great to know florencia says
hi I don't know the current topic but
anyone have a good waterproof eyeliner
drugstore high-end please and thanks for
high end well sephora brand like i was
saying is also is really really nice
i'll let you guys kind of answer that
question because I've got the Sephora
ones here and then water line i'm trying
to think off the top of my head because
I don't probably put a lot J cap people
that was gonna say I don't really put a
lot in my waterline a lot of times I'll
use eyeshadow which I feel like is very
very effective for the lower lash line I
love the jcat beauty ones if you can
find them I know they don't sell them at
Ulta anymore but the jcat beauty ones
are really good they look like these
hashtag motd they're very very nice um
really like those a lot these were sent
to me though by jake at beauty just say
no but they don't know that I'm making
this hashtag not sponsored they are very
nice and let's see other one who I like
um the Malley ones aren't bad those kind
of can drip down over time but the
Malley ones aren't bad for lower lash
line but I really like the Jake a beauty
ones and I like the Sephora once those
are probably my favorites right now
that's me personally um let's see okay
says she's over Urban Decay urban negate
iPad souls are so overhyped like I feel
like that they use down my face the
Urban Decay eye pencils the the pencil
pencil ones like the eyeliners I don't
really like them that much I really
don't I think they're so overhyped and
tab depended tab says there's another
tab that here yes there is no length oh
I forget your nerd link full on here you
call me tab is on periscope lose track
of all you people usernames alright k
says the land calm liquid drama I pencil
is legit that's good to know and
stephanie says thanks for the shoutout
Jan I think we should have a designation
step one step two I know right seriously
call you Steph be a muggle Michelle woot
I figured out how to join in comment yay
happy you're here Michelle and nikki
says OMG kind of side side track I must
watch girlfriend you are the sidetrack
Queen I love you but you're the psychic
sidetracked lead
Brett had PhD she just did a graph or
pronounced cost analysis of ingredients
similarity list for liquid lipsticks yes
it is the coolest video if you are in
any way like a graphing like math person
it is the coolest video ever redhead PhD
who is I've been subscribed to her
forever she just recently subscribed my
channel she broke down every lip wig
with liquid lipstick brand from lime
crime to Anasazi Beverly Hills to girl
on to color pop she broke them down this
graph for like I'm like getting chills
because this video is so good for like
ingredient things like so you can see
like which products share the most
ingredients also for a value for price
point like how the best which one's the
best value and the worst value based on
their price per ounce like it is the
coolest video it is like the geekiest
makeup video i have ever seen in my
entire life because it is so like math
related and it's just it's so good oh my
goodness i'm totally with your nikki i
watched about half of it and then the
kids distracted me and i never watch the
rest of it but i need to go back and
watch the rest of it because it was so
good oh my gosh alright so i'll get me
on track Nicki but you're giving me good
things to talk about um yeah they were
saying how the steeler liquid lipsticks
are such a bad value for what you get so
and then yeah it's anyway um Jean says I
agree with you about the bucks and the
buxom eyeshadow palettes are fabulous um
caitlin says i agree i love the Bucks
and shadows as well buxom I showed us
they really are fantastic muggle
Michelle says the Sephora dupe of the dr
door air flash airbrush foundation is
amazing makes my skin flawless it comes
in a pale enough shade you know I
couldn't find any foundations that I
felt like I needed to talk about in this
video either they are hyped and deserve
the hype or they're not hyped and they
don't deserve high but not that amazing
so I couldn't I don't have anything fit
into this category in my foundation
collection so um poachy check hello my
dear love the buxom eyeshadow palettes
my absolute favorite is no foe well cool
man I don't know if I have that one I
don't have no foe I'll to look later in
today's and see if I have no foe I don't
know f aux
is the folk or if you're watching with
some replay um Helen k says Helen me to
to face asuka the chocolate bar for life
I just recently got it that deserves
every bit of hype that it gets gene says
i bought a buxom palette that you get to
pick the shades and i love mine exactly
exactly these two they came with the
pick your own shades but basically they
just gave us two empty pallets and all
of these shadows and then this is kind
of just how i put them together I don't
really think that they go together like
this but you know that's just what I
chose to do that's the way they ended up
I don't know that's just what I did but
they're very very nice um everyone saw
him at the bucks and pallets that's what
I was talking about at that time
Michelle says clarins makes really good
cream blushes that don't accentuate
pores they're beautiful but don't come
in many shades that's awesome to know I
know that / below they're like faded now
because I was like rubbing my hand all
over the place so they're a little faded
at this point but they definitely last a
really long time with primer Katelyn
says I want one one pallet of bucks and
shadows and want to make it I have one
pallet of buxom Xiao doesn't want to
make another one but they're always out
of stock the ones i wanted to for all
man i'm stephanie says so many
stephanies now I never heard another
Stephanie cropping up all right talking
about the bucks and palate semi-sweet is
amazing i've heard mixed reviews on the
tube a semi-sweet mixed reviews on that
I'm not playing on getting it I'm happy
with the one that I have chocolate bar
is amazing it's totally worth trying
it's so unique like even if you think
you have a million neutral pallets you
can still get the toothpaste I'm such an
enabler I'm such an enabler I think that
everybody should own the chocolate bar
palette like everybody everybody I can't
think of a single person that shouldn't
own the chocolate bar palette even
people that are scared of eyeshadows
forget the chocolate bar palette because
I bet you you can find a shade and all
over lid color shade that you like in
there mm-hmm all right the DM cute yes
even make a queen she is cute she's a
sweetheart too I went to her release
party for the the palette this was
actually Harley we've got a ticket to
her release party he got a palette with
it so I paid for it kind of in that I've
bought a ticket to the party and I got
this for free but the take the price of
the ticket was a little bit more than
the price of the palette so I pay
for the palate ah let's see Maddie says
the elf prism pallets are beautiful and
amazing and affordable that is so
awesome Kenisha says jan the Urban Decay
Pulp Fiction palette is amazing really
the Black Radiance waterproof liquid
liner how surprised you said about the
pulp fiction I when I first saw that
pulp fiction not I remember it's like
you know I remember when you were where
you were on 911 like you remember where
you were if you're old enough when the
Challenger crashed you know I remember
where I was when I saw the pulp fiction
palette for the first time I was with my
family at the beach in um at a an
aquarium in a North Carolina at outer
banks and I remember walking through and
seeing this pulp fiction palette and
seeing the price on it and the teeny
tiny little eye shadows and I said are
they insane charging this much for these
little teeny tiny little eye shadows but
then I heard really good things Ganesha
about the palette itself and then it
went on silly sale and I should have
gotten it i didn't but it's good to know
if it ever comes back on silly sale on
my PO for something i should get it so
weird how you remembered little things
like that anyway that was so off topic
all right the Black Radiance waterproof
liquid liner I need to try that and the
Revlon Photoready I arts are beautiful
many mascara from Marin ass by the way
first timer for chats so glad you are
here Kenisha I'll you know what I love
them here knows that I'm in love with is
this I got this at the birchbark shop
when i was in new york i love this I
primer it is so good it kind of reminds
me of Eden a little bit and then mutes
out discoloration it's really nice
really really nice um I wish I can put
on my eyes but I can't because i already
put something on some other my eyes
already put the so the bow the other
wood on the Urban Decay T no one but

good to know about the UM about the mere

Chrisette my monthly obsessions com
how'd you check to 1274 but says J Omega
Queen has a limit edition holiday
version for sale now no way oh I need to
check that out I need to check that out
good morning to nammy and fizzy pop says
I never heard anyone talk about sugar
pill I'm your magic videos on my show
people either I feel like sugar pill is
too crazy for me it's to indy for me
like two nice a nd meaning like like
indie music like too bright and neon and
punk like I doesn't fit into me like I
probably could use some of their colors
but it's like I'm not going out of my
way you know what I mean if I see sugar
pills somewhere if I ever saw it in a
store I might try it but like it all the
makeup things their line is so long that
I never waited mine and like their
palates like they're just too I don't
know they don't call me there too in
your face you know like I don't know
it's just a personal preference thing
like I don't know I'm not drawn to sugar
pill like I'm drawn to the packaging
visually but makeup-wise I'm not drawn
to it I don't know I don't know why I
know Nikki like sugar pill stuff Nikki
that's here somewhere in here somewhere
she got that's Edward Scissorhands
pallidus sugar pill yes she did a
beautiful look with that on the ones to
make up at all right 1049 me show you
the last problem that I wanted to show
you that are not hyped enough on YouTube
and they are oh that's not it revlon any
of these any of these things whichever
one cost you they are all good all of
these I love them I love them so much
and I don't use them enough they are so
good they're so good this is the matte
ones i would probably say the mountains
are my favorites followed very closely
by the reg
the ones I just notice I have a Jacob
beauty one Jacob beauty ones are very
similar the twisting kiss by Jacob
beauty is very similar very opaque these
are wonderful too if you can get your
hands on these but this is more
accessible to revlon I'm dropping them
you're so good the lapper ones are
beautiful let me just kind of show you a
swatch them here the lacquer ones and
you don't need a lip gloss basically
it's like lipstick and lipgloss all
together in one step the matte ones are
truly mad but they're not drying um the
regular ones are like this one the just
bitten kissable balm stains are kind of
shiny in between so you got shiny matte
and then somewhere in between for the
the regular just been but all of them
are good now the other thing about this
though is they wear another thing is
that they can I speak they wear down
there evenly which is very nice overall
and I really enjoy these there are
definitely not hyped up enough on
YouTube I know people used to talk about
them a lot they don't talk about them
enough anymore um the other one I want
to show you is this Milani liquid
lipstick no not milani mmm maranatha
liquid lipsticks feeding a mere ness
fabulous liquid lipstick that no one
talks about wonderful absolutely
wonderful oh you know what though as far
as the Revlon ones I compare these to
the color top one the colour-pop ones
are cheaper than base so if you're going
to get um like stick lipsticks honestly
I probably go with the colour-pop ones
but these ones are really good too and
they're not hyped up enough does that
make sense so am I going backwards here
because i think the colour-pop ones are
just as good in their cheaper but these
are also good but they're not hyped I
think I'm on topic yeah okay it's got
confused for a second but yeah the mirin
asks liquid lipsticks are really really
good and not hip to not so that's all
the products that I have I'm going to go
ahead and reach down and there was one
more lip product that I haven't heard
much about the Park Avenue princess
lipstick by tort I don't overall like
tart lipsticks but this one is just the
perfect nude for me it's very very sheer
this is the perfect lipstick for
somebody that doesn't like lipstick and
wants to just start trying lipstick for
the
very first time it's wonderful i'm gonna
go ahead and put it on just to show you
because it is so natural i can wear it
right now okay like that's it it's very
very natural very nice and my red spots
covered but it's very natural and it's
nice and I like it a lot I would imagine
this would be a really nice topper to to
go over top of deeper ellipse tix I kind
of change the tone of it it's very very
nice and it's very moisturizing it's
really really moisturizing has a nice
smell too was the smell minty minty kind
of snow very very nice they're nice all
right let me go ahead and read some more
comments we've got seven minutes left
i'm going to read as many comments as i
can and give you more makeup awesomeness
from the collective makeup brain all
right hmm kay says i love the becca
ombre rouge pellet to that one is
perfect no one talks about it awesome
nanny says was limit we were talking
about we're talking about what my palate
fell I fell off huh all right Tabitha

website I can never find them in stores

to be gentle with out I wasn't expecting

else you could take this for travel and
you wouldn't need I need to bring
anything else you got just born two
shades you can do gorgeous I looks just
with this palette you've got your blush
even as I wish they'd put more like a
neutrally than a coral blush in there um
highlights nice the bronzer is nice it's
just a really nice cut also that if you
want in a little more well the nick
saban pop I also got this in the
generation beauty swag bag is also

organizer absolutely seventy says
perfusion came out the 36 eyeshadow
palette today I found it at walgreens
for five dollars amazing Urban Decay
dupes and the shadows are amazing that
is so awesome you know I feel like
profusion is kind of because i've
swatched it I don't own any but i've
swatched it is similar to the Coastal
Scents reveal palettes and that I feel
like some of them are amazing and then
some of them leave a lot of Fallout and
some of them are just chalky but you can
get some amazing shades in those
perfusion palettes it's just kind of
digging through least the ones that i've
swatched I think don't even ask me which
ones I swatch but if five below a lot of
times they'll have those and I'll have
them open and also watch them and some
of them seem like they're going to be
good it's among feel like it's like
apples you know so but that's good to
know that that one's really good the 36
eyeshadow palette that you knew from for
from perfusion alright you just you guys

many comments that I was trying to
scroll down and I ran out of room to
look at the comments so some comments
got completely lost so if i missed you

you because i think i missed about 10
minutes worth of comments and then we
have one minute left so i'm going to try
to get through as many from the top of
where I'm at as I can Krista said I
stocked up on Kat Von D blushes when
there's ten dollars
I tried to stock up on them and they
were all sold out so I was very sad I
went to my support jcpenney I went
everywhere looking for them I could not
find them couldn't get them online I
missed it so I was sad Becca says I was
out for the show I was scared you were
having trouble you're always very
punctual I know it was it was a mess
last night I I'm not gonna tell the
whole story i'll take up the whole time
but it was a mess but I worked it out
and it went live it was just 15 minutes

they're very unique in pigmented and
last very cool you know I used to watch
Florida force and then I lost the
connection like I feel like I lost I
couldn't watch her anymore like I just
wasn't feeling like like I wasn't
feeling that connection that love
through the videos so i unsubscribed
it's nothing personal against her I just
wasn't feeling it so I didn't even know
she came out with our shadows didn't you
know I don't know what happened I tracy
said she's not a famous of four mascaras
either good morning to Deanna good to

buffering um savvy says my eyes are
still watery so nothing stays in my
waterline I've given up oh no um kay
says I haven't tried to form mascaras

try the mascara one it's not good um
let's see or Allah says just started
watching yay for live video yeah that
you're here and busy pop says yes I do a
lot of online shopping meet you and then
Kaylee says the NARS audacious mascara
do that to me noritake audacious master
did nothing for me nothing it was
terrible like I don't know how NARS make
something like that and takes themselves
seriously it's like you're NARS for
goodness sakes and you make this
terrible mascara and then you hype it up
like it's amazing and then it's terrible
like did you try it before they did I
don't get that one I don't get the NARS
audacious mascara it's horrible so I saw
having our guy throw it away I probably
still have it might wonder why I think I
put away because we're so bad I know
where it is my empties the lenses have a
sample of it suitable it does nothing
and it's got these crazy spikes on it
like how in the world would is that
going to grab onto anything there to
thurs face too far apart I guess like
what what's clumped a little bit change
my lashes to black and that's about it
