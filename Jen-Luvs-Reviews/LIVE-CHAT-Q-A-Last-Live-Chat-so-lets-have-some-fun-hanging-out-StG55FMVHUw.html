meant to bring in here was my um was my
my map for showing where we're going on

this is the plan so those are either
wondering where I'm traveling to close
that when I'm traveling to I'm traveling
across the united states that we live in
maryland so we're going to go up across
i said this a few times so if you've
already heard this I apologize we're
going across the United States so we're
gonna are we rushing basically to
Colorado that's where all the fun
happens so we're going to stop through
Indianapolis but I don't know we've been
talking about doing some meetups but I
have an iron out the details yet so I'm
not going to be talking about where the
meetups are going to be yet because I'm
still trying to iron out those details
Michelle I will let John know I'm happy
father's day and happy birthday from you
I will um so uh so yeah so we're going
to be going to from the shore Carmen you
from the shore that's awesome alright so
we're going to Colorado and then once we
get to Colorado my husband must be
making a smoothie to apologize if you
can hear that um Colorado up to
Yellowstone down to the Grand Canyon
we're going to pass your new mexico and
see my friend Lilly spurgeon give her
big hugs and hang out with her then
we're going to go down through Texas
down a new oral
from New Orleans were going to orlando
from Orlando we're going up to Myrtle
Beach Virginia Beach and then back home
so we're doing all of that in one month
so this is the thing what's going to
happen I'm we might go through dallas
definitely Kenisha I don't know I'm not
a hundred percent sure but that we're
definitely driving through there I don't
know if we're going to be doing meet up
there or not we haven't decided yet so
yeah so we're taking three weeks to a
month to do this big road trip so for
filming them for the channel and I'm
going to do a big video that's shorter
than this one about it is we're going to
be filming from everywhere so I'm trying
to find like nice locations to film so
be really cool be like what's up and
make up from the Grand Canyon like how
awesome is that you know I got out fun
would that be so we're going to a lot of
different places and this is the thing
this is the way we decided first of all
John and I love to travel second of all
I thought would be really great for the
kids you know to UM had the experience
of going across the country seeing
different places Jessica Weaver Austin
is fantastic so um there's a lot we're
really looking forward to it's a lot of
driving though it's um I want to say
that it's seven over 7,000 miles try so
we gotta go pro John got a dash cam um
you got a bunch of stuff we have a store
called rei i'm not sure if that's a
nationwide but it's like an outdoor
store they had a twenty percent off
sales to john went nuts at the twenty
percent off sale and bought like a GoPro
and bought us a six person tent so we're
gonna be tenting you know and
campgrounds a lot and then when we can't
stand up we'll stay in hotels things
like that so I'm really looking forward
to it so we'll be doing a little bit of
vlogging will be doing um like I don't
know I'm not even a hundred percent sure
exactly how that's going to work so
Nadine says virginia beach check out
stanbridge shakes the chicks beach I
don't know that one in yorktown beach my
sister-in-law actually lives in Virginia
Beach she knows all like the best spot I
would write those down may I watch the
replay I just sent him out loud so I'll
watch the replay and get it and he says
Texas is big yes yeah Texas is big but
i'm not sure exactly where in texas were
going to be something's I think Amy are
in Texas I think um julia says she
wished she could do that yeah rei is
pretty fun so that's kind of
deal with the road trip and then we'll
be back until I actually have my my
20-year highschool reunion the weekend
we get back so that should be
interesting i'm one of the event
coordinators for my 20-year highschool
reunion so that's kind of cool we've
been working on lots of things i'm in
charge of nametags so i have to do those
before i go thank you so much Billy uh
don't forget your sunscreen yes yeah
super quiche I will not forget my
sunscreen Liz says on on vacation yeah
you on vacation with my only vacation
this summer can't wait Oh Liz amanda
wants to know if I will be on periscope
at all and the answer that is yes I will
be on periscope playing on periscope and
quite a bit the only problem it with
kara scope is that periscope eats data I
do have an unlimited plan on my phone
but once you get past a certain point
they start slowing down your service at
least they're supposed to so if they if
they slow down my service I might not be
able to periscope through 4G very much
so we'll have to see Gina wants to know
when i'm leaving I am leaving on Friday
we're leaving Friday to go so this
weekend is going to be a mini version of
whatsapp makeup I'm actually giving the
reporters three week three to four weeks
off Tabitha's taking off the rest of the
reporters are taking off and they're
helping me a little bit there I've asked
them to just give me a couple of things
but they're mostly taking time off and
I'm going to be doing what's of the
makeup pretty much by myself which is
fine with me i could have just stopped
doing what's up and make up completely
but i didn't want to because number one
I don't want the I don't want the top
news and the big releases to go unsaid
so I really want to have this is kind of
taking off you never take off because
you're always there for me girlfriend um
but yeah so I'm gonna be doing a lot of
it on my own which is totally cool with
me because I used to pretty much run on
my own it was just me and three
reporters at one point or for reporters
in the very beginning so I'm totally
cool with doing it on my own and they'll
be there for backup you know I know
they're still be slipping me stuff so we
have some good news so that's that's
pretty exciting i'm actually kind of
looking forward to flying solo so
jen wants to know how long till you come
to Utah well the only thing we have
planned is july 4th where we should be
in Yellowstone for july 4th that's the
only thing we have plans so you could
talk should be three or four days after

okay Catherine wants to know what makeup
I'm packing I haven't a hundred percent
decided yet I've had some requested you
like what I pack my makeup bag that
would be a really good one to do while
I'm on the road because I'll have it
with me so it would be a great way for
me to do a video while I'm on the road I
definitely i don't know i mean before I
leave I definitely want to review the
beauty color palette and the swamp queen
felt like this week I want to film my
face off and do some reviews have some
things packed up so these these two
reviews are definitely coming I want to
do these before I go because by the time
I get back and a month nobody's gonna
care so well though many people will
still care but still so these two are
definitely getting reviewed I also need
to review the Revlon eyeliners the three
tip eyeliner
those three reviews are definitely going
to be coming before oh let's say
anything else that I know I need to
review those are the three major things
I need to review before I go so I don't
know if I'm gonna be bringing these with
me or not I haven't decided yet I you
know I think it's going to be one of
those things where once I start packing
i'm just going to know what i'm going to
do i'm super key says heatproof make up
for sure I know right I know Delaney's
daily doses just take your outs nine
drawers with you teach you all yeah we
could do them we could do that couldn't
wait that would be funny I'll be awesome
hey honey can we put the helmet on the
roof of the coop uh Emmy says no sound

issues um Catherine says it just film
the power of makeup awesome Catherine
Catherine downing is the name of her
Channel definitely check it out I have
never seen I haven't seen too many power
of makeup videos I've seen a few of them
but not too many they're really neat
though uh what kind of snacks are we
taking with us we mostly do like healthy
and actually get graze box I know if you
guys know graze box but it's a weekly
subscription across five dollars a week
we get the ten-dollar week once we get
the mega box because we just wreck our
braised box so so they're like little
snacks so we'll definitely be bringing
some of those my husband loves beef
jerky so there's the only going to be
beef jerky ball I'm sure I like to eat
I'm a big fan of white of white cheddar
popcorn smart food popcorn I'm a huge
fan of that I remember when I was
pregnant with John can't remember if it
was John or Lila but I was having one of
those moods and I was hungry okay you
guys are good on sound awesome um I was
so hungry and I was starving and I was
like like King and get me some popcorn
he was like hey I'll get you some
popcorn is like what do you want and I
was like smart food popcorn is what are
you talking about smart food popcorn and
we had this whole conversation I
remember yelling they're just just
getting a popcorn like I would like
yelling at him and it was a horrible it
was so mean to him but it was like
pregnant and you know and so forever now
whenever I asked him to get me popcorn
it's like this joke that I yelled at him
so what delaney wants to know what is
your husband
for work I'm sure you said I know you
talked what does he do we own a tattoo
studio it's called tattooed heart
studios it's in a town called hanover
maryland it's a pretty big tattoo studio
in the area if you go to the website
tattooed heart com ta titi oo IDI heart
calm you'll be able to see the studio
it's absolutely gorgeous and we have
like a water feature in the front and
like there's a the rooms are all built
out the John really like he he knows a
guy who built it out and didn't want to
deal with it anymore like he so John is
basically running the it's his studio
but that space the guy our landlord guy
had already built it out so we didn't
have to pay any money to have it built
out but like the rooms have privacy
glass so when you flip the switch in the
tattoo room like it'll be all glass and
you flick the switch and it Frost's over
and it's super super cool so it's like
really high-end tattoo studio Margaret
says I've been there oh really that's so
funny I'll have to touch base about that
and figure out who you got tattooed by
and all of that but yes my husband owns
that studio so people have been asking
me and this will go into my my um my
video that I do on me quitting you
quitting teaching for youtube if you
know people ask and say you know you
only have 50,000 subscribers why would
you quit a full-time job and and my
husband makes pretty good money he's
good I don't need we're gonna be good
financially if I think we're gonna be
good financially I wouldn't have quit my
job will be fine um my son isn't going
to be in private school anymore I that's
was twelve thousand dollars a year for
private school so he's not going to meet
in private school anymore and that'll be
that was a quarter of my paycheck third
of my paycheck so that's going to be
great um and you know we'll be fine I'll
be good so and then I'm hoping that once
I can commit time to the channel I'll be
able to put up a lot more really good
content and if they take off they do
which I'm hoping that they do and but
that's not my you know if it happens it
happens if it doesn't have it doesn't
happen I'm not going to be changing who
i am i'm not going to be taking more
sponsored videos just to earn money like
we're not in a position like that what
we have to have that you
no we could live off of what he earns on
our own without me earning anything from
youtube so i don't think that I'm gonna
change or that things are going to be
you know we're now you know that I'm
gonna be you know trying to you know
talk to you about you know razors or
something or like you know diet pills
and it's not gonna happen so don't worry
about that um Carolyn wants to know if I
have tattoos yes I do I have a bunch
Thank You Meg meg says my contents
wonderful thank you so much and Jenna
says it will happen all thank you cesses
please don't go sponsored most YouTube's
are making her madly oh I can say most
youtubers are pissing me off lately cuz
i can say that now with the stupid best
fiends a phone game yet ain't gonna
happen ain't gonna happen um the only
the only phone game I would ever promote
to you which this is hashtag not
sponsored is The Price is Right bingo I
am so addicted on my phone to The Price
is Right bingo it's it's embarrassing
it's embarrassing but I love that
sinking game I love bingo I'm like a old
lady I know I know Karen I know Oh back
to the tattoo so my tag I'm slipping all
over the place if you had a TD this is
like the perfect are you good I am all
over the place um I do have tattoos
they're mostly all on my back I do have
one on my ankle from our yeah The Price
is Right bingo Roxanne I've one of my
ankle of the wedding couple from our
wedding invitations it's just like a
sketch outline of a bride and groom and
then I have a fairytale theme on my back
monday i'll probably do one day i'll
probably do it excuse me a video of my
about my tattoos and everything but
they're all kind of faded at this point
like they're not in tip-top shape i've
got tattooed in like 46 years something
like that so Valerie says bingos awesome
Valerie prices the fizzy pop says gent
rice lingo slots bingo oh my gosh oh my
gosh um jenna says even Wayne Goss worth
of worth the bug game I don't know what
that means oh did he he did not Wayne
Goss did the did a sponsored video with
the but the game I wouldn't believe that
Delaney says sponsor videos just dropped
credibility for me unless it is
disclosed up front like big channels
don't even say and I have to look in the
scription bucks find out yeah I don't do
that and you guys know when I do
sponsored videos I always tell you in
beginning like if you watch my poster
choice video I tell you right in the
beginning that it's a sponsored video
and the reason why I do that is because
that's what i want as a viewer so I
treat people the way I'd like to be
treated so in the beginning and if
people don't want to watch a video that
was sponsored if they don't trust me
because of it they can click off right
there and not waste their time you know
what's the point of going through an
entire video like I there was one time I
was watching a video and I watched the
whole video and I'm sitting there
thinking I'm like was that sponsored
because that sounded sponsored my even
sure if that was sponsored and I
remember like think I'm not gonna buy
that like there was something I was
really interested in I was like you know
what I'm not gonna get that because I
think that was sponsored that sound
sponsor so I didn't end up buying it um
you know I mean I just amanda says I
used to like wind gusts but I don't
really watch him anymore he titled his
titles are so click bait and I think his
content is kind of gone downhill I
really enjoy wage channel I think that
he he has a lot of knowledge about
makeup so I'm very much subscribed away
tonight to watch a lot of his videos not
everyone but a lot of them Ellen says
sometimes they don't even say to the sub
box which is I was I know and then
that's the thing too is it's like--
people sitting there with their sheets
you know they've got their paper there
with my paper and they're like like and
it comes with three colors of your
choice with it being under sit you know
and it will be released on and they've
got their paper sitting there and it's
like dude dude you're reading your your
press release and it's not even
disclosed like what are you kidding me
so lily says that thing Emily Noel is
real trust you trust her yet every in a
while is amazing she's absolutely
amazing emily and i watched a kathy from
terrific is still one of my addictions
um who else do I watch a lot Emily I
still really love tati and trust hottie
I know some people have things with tati
but I love Tati uh hello so I watch a
lot that I trust a lot of people um I
can't have any more top of my head Laura
from mrs. Llewellyn
she's still one of my faves but lots of
lots of channels 7 me says I like that
his videos are short sweet and to the
point but I agree with the clickbait
carmat yeah his videos are short which
is very nice that they're nice and short
Valerie says it's like I love my morphe
pellets so much not so answers but
here's my affiliate code well you know
um zabrina nadine yes i love zabrina
love zabrina um esther says what do you
when you're doing a detailed review of
the new smashbox master class power i'm
eyeing it like a oh I should I forgot
about that one oh well I'll tell you
right now where did it go where is it
what I do with it I promise it was right
here a second ago that's why I didn't
mention it because it wasn't behind me I
feel when I feel my kind of oh there it
is there here hold on a second we'll do
a little mini review right now just so
you can know right now it's really good
it's really good we'll do a little mini
review but I need to do a full review on
this too I completely forgot alright my
biggest complaint about this is that
this gets dirty and gross so you have to
make sure you clean this so it doesn't
look so nasty because that just looks
gross um the highlighters are not good
in my opinion the contours are a little
difficult to work with I haven't used
these very much the color correctors
I've used the peach I've used the green
I don't need a lot of color correcting
so I don't feel like I can speak to
those very well the eyeshadows are
phenomenal they're wonderful all the
shades of use have been fantastic the
blushes are very nice too so if you like
this sign I would definitely recommend
it this side is definitely weaker than
this side um they were these don't work
at all they're like like I don't like
these things at all like they're they're
really not they don't put hardly any
pigmentation on the cheats and it's just
they're cut they're really really weak
they're very they remind me almost of
like dollar store makeup we're like you
put your finger in it and let me show
you you put your finger in it and it's
got a little bit of a gloss to it but it
doesn't show up anywhere like it just
doesn't show up I mean it gives you the
tiniest Tiny's a little bit of something
and they're really really really bad Oh
Tara babies that's another really good
one so this palette in case you
is it when I was just saying it this is
the new smashbox masterclass Calot
lighting theory so if you like the
shadows and the side definitely ask this
side if this is why you're buying it you
might want to pass um yeah i mean like
these but i can't speak to these so if I
can't I can't even I don't know that
might push it over the edge for you
because they are very um very very
pigmented so I would imagine these would
work really well people with a lot of
discoloration this is my natural skin I
have nothing on other than a little bit
on my brows so um but yeah so that's a
little mini review of this but I do want
to do a full review on that that's a
good idea forgot about that three things
I need the ring before things now with
the eyeliners terror babies is fantastic
Kenisha says uh Nancy says so half the
palette kind of not worth the purchase
yeah i mean i really like the shadows
are great but maybe and says i love
angie from hot and flashy oh yeah she's
super fab she knows her sunscreen
anti-aging skincare she sure does
Valerie says Jen on another note I can
actually see the SWAT thats watch with
your new camera looks good yeah oh it's
so good yay um that makes me really
happy smashbox is super hit and miss
miss super cute says yes absolutely and
chris decision great skin Jen thank you
so much st. honey oh my goodness I'm so
glad you're here I was a little worried
about you Barbara can you use them wet
um the eyeshadows I don't know I haven't
tried they've been pretty fantastic
without trying them wet Emma says you
look great all thank you so much and
Catherine says we tried the beauty box
subscription or heard anything about it
the beauty box no I don't know that one
Billy says I really want to try the
two-faced liners I do too they look
amazing the new toothpaste liners I want
them so bad it was a giveaway on
Instagram I never entered giveaways
never because I have so much makeup that
it's like I feel like it's almost not
fair from you to win a giveaway like I
want people to win giveaways that don't
have a lot of makeup but that was one I
entered because I really wanted those
eyeliners only and they're so expensive
but that was pretty much it um Delaney
says I shadows wet no they're too dry i
don't feel like would work well wet yeah
I don't I honestly I haven't tried it I
hesitate to put water on my
I was I was like I'm a hard pan like I I
very rarely will use water on my shadows
unless they're just really bad and I'm
gonna throw them away anything but like
I'll use um one people use fix+ by Mac
I'll use by people on a mixing solution
and I this stuff they don't make anymore
which makes me so angry but this is kind
of like fixed plus I don't think they
really need it you know you're really
very pigmented they're very nice so Elmo
says I'm so proud of myself I made it to
the alarm clock was successful yay jima
says well good morning been a while for
me so good to see you good to see you
got to gina's in the house amanda says
anyone else excited for the Too Faced
Born This Way concealer I'm excited to
see reviews I know the reviews already
out but haven't watched any yet Delaney
says I've heard I've had hard pan in the
Smashbox master class 3 cuz I tried it
wet yeah I remove yeah and then Kenisha
says I hate the feeling of using wet
shadows yeah it's a little bit different
definitely and says so she's you ruined
too many shadows because a hard pan
exactly that's why I don't really mess
with the water very much Susan says I
spray the brush once i get shadow on it
usually with fixed plus yeah that's a
good idea that see I think that's
smarter because then you're not putting
the fixed plus or the mixing solution or
the water into the actual shadow that's
smart but then if you're going back and
forth isn't your brush wet though at
that point I thought imagine i'll be
hard Oh Katherine said sorry it's called
beauty box five it's Anna mint green box
I used to do beauty box five I did not
enjoy it I actually that is the promo
subscription and ask them to stop
sending it to me because I didn't enjoy
it I felt like it was a waste of a video
because it really was not a good
subscription unfortunately them now this
was at least six months ago that I stop
reviewing it so it's possible that it
could be that it could be better now but
Alma wants to know if we're cooking
tonight on periscope if you don't know
on periscope I cook four nights a week
and we could get them together i get a
peach dish which is a food subscription
box and i also get blue apron which is
another feed subscription box I don't
know it kind of depends on what john
wants to do I have a feeling not because
I think he wants to go out to dinner he
doesn't like to buy a cake because he he
likes to just had a slice of cake
instead um keep it real cam says gotta
run have a great day came by and then
Cheryl says Jen did you get them on a
renaissance no I'm gonna pass on the
modern renaissance even though it looks
amazing I've heard nothing but good
things about modern renaissance so yeah
super quiche wants them who you're
voting for its a bit of NYX face awards
if you're voting at all beauty Christy
for the win raw beauty Chrissy I love
Radha BTW Christie if you're not
watching the next phase Awards this is
the first year i've watched it because
Chrissy's in it and i love christie
Christie's my girl so I'm voting
Christie um my husband actually tattoos
one of the other contestants and her
name is Ryan something Ryan I can't
remember she's the one that does the
lips she was a lot of lip art um and she
got in with his gorgeous Marilyn Monroe
prints on my lips like absolutely
amazing and then for the first challenge
she did like a rose like a regular rose
and then she did like a wilted rose on
her lips but yeah so show John is voting
for her and I'm voting for Christy so
and they both made it to the top 20 so I
cannot wait for the videos to come out
can not wait um witness says hub does
tattoos yes my husband is a tattoo
artist he's owned the shop since 2005 um
and yeah so he opened it from scratch he
was 23 years old when he opened the shop
I believe and he started from the ground
up and now he's built it something
amazing Ryan Kelly thank you so much
Nancy Ryan Kelly so he tattoos her so so
that's who he's voting for is ryan kelly
thank you so much for saying that I
appreciate it um let's say carli bybel
palette any thoughts I love my carli
bybel Calvin love it I have right here I
know exactly where is it's very very
nice the quad he is really good my only
complaint about the carli bybel talent
is there isn't really a lot of shade
range here like these two shades this
highlight and this I mean they're
essentially the exact same I mean
they're slightly different but on the I
they look exactly the stinking same so I
mean it's really like one feature and
one's more champagne but really I mean
there's just isn't a lot of variation
and like these two here very very
similar and it's like I wish that they
include more included more variation and
I mean you can do a bunch of news
without them being so stinking similar
so that's my only complaint but the
quality of is fantastic so if you really
really really like this you will really
love it it's like the colors you'll
really love it Sam honey wants to know
if they do portrait tattoos some of the
artists you my husband does not he does
are mostly mandalas and like symmetrical
designs things like that mine does not
smell at all Alma she said the Kali
Bible smells bad I've had it for a while
I don't remember my never smelling that
maybe it was just the ones that you had
um let me see Linda says surprise the
quality is go to the carli bybel pot yes
and you know what with the H cosmetics
there have been very few products that I
like from bhcosmetics i remember i did a
big bh cosmetics hall and i didn't even
end up doing a video on I don't think
because the stuff was so bad and it was
like I don't know I probably should have
just gone on and told y'all how bad it
was like no I think I ended up bringing
things back I think this was a while ago
I think I ended up putting it in my
monthly favorites video a lot of stuff
about like not liking a lot of it I'm
like their blushes were really bad and
like a lot of stuff is really bad so I
like this from bhcosmetics and I also
really like wants for you this here the
galaxy sheet palette and someone you can
get this for like six bucks like
something really cheap so if you want
like colored eye shadows this is really
really really fantastic really fantastic
highly recommend this one when he says
I'm sorry Jen if you answered this
before but i've been absent from youtube
a while for vacation what it what was it
Wendy I missed it hold on a minute let
me see if Wendy asked a question to then
go up um I saw that it's going to be at
all to now is is all bh going to be at
Ulta I have no idea I would imagine it
would depend on how well the carli bybel
palette cells um whether they would put
more but that's a guess I don't know
that officially that's just my guess
that they're kind of testing the waters
with it to see how it goes Katherine
says are they bringing the biggest name
palette back from to face I heard a
rumor that they were but I don't know
that for a fact you gotta remember too
is I
I don't I don't get any special like I
don't get any special messages from any
companies except for like a couple of
indie brands um MBA cosmetics I have a
hook up with in there with agape love
girl on YouTube she knows all the ins
and outs of MBA cosmetics but other than
that like we just find stuff like we
just go to the internet and find stuff
like everybody else we go on Instagram
we go on blogs go you know we don't we
don't get like special like PR like
information wherever from different
brands so um Linda says t-shirt is cute
oh thank you so much my little penguins
you should always act like dog hair on
me oh my gosh my dog is like a mess so I
apologize if you're offended by my fuzzy
shirt it's all dog love it's dog love
that says just get the nici palate it's
very similar to the biggest nay is it
really think that it looks similar I
haven't put them side by side but yeah
okay benecke tutorials palette yes and
then amanda says what's a brand that you
think is really underrated under Reagan
I think about that one most the brands i
like our brands that are pretty popular
on your way then Jake at beauty Jake at
beauty that's the one I don't have to
say Jake at new dean has some amazing
stuff they have some stuff that's not so
good but they have some amazing stuff
like for example and you ever run into
these trios they sent me these just so
you know I always tell you right away um
Jake a beauty set me a bunch of stuff a
long time ago but these these baked eye
shadows are so good I don't like the
blinky ones the new ones I don't like
them but these are so amazing these
trios the blue one is not good but other
than the blue one like I've got cherry
fudge sundae here I've got a grilled
mango these are all good this one's
really good this one is baked Alaska
these are all amazing so I would say
Jake a beauty all via their eye liners
are really good except for that the tips
will break so if the tips break it
bothers you to the tips break you will
not like them but but the product
is really good it's just kind of soft
but yeah these are these are fab super
fat but don't get the blinky ones to the
blinky ones are not fab at all julia
says Jesse's girls underrated I think
the only thing I like from jesse's girl
is the eye on her I don't like their
eyeshadows like the Calot I I gotta
Jessie's Girl palette was horrible it
was really really bad at least for me
sometimes when I say something is
horrible people like no it's my favorite
i love it and it's like I'm sorry I
ain't it so um so yeah that's that's the
way I feel about Jess people i love the
eyeliner though cheryl says pure is
underrated i think they have some great
products i have tried a lot from pure
minerals Delaney says yes and I don't
agree with all she says all the time but
a great way to get up to speed on things
without having to look everything up is
that you try not me how about tossing I
guess I meet people talking about
Chauncey too but either way glad you
don't have to agree all the time Susan
says i love my the ball products i love
most of mine too and krista says
bellapierre bellapierre does have some
really nice stuff really good point
Wendy says I love the way the bomb feels
and swatches but on my eye there were
just a few that were like um yeah mm-hmm
karen says I like Patrice a lot um and
CF and cheap I don't see f I'm missing
the Akron where CS new moons alright
Kenisha says I'll hold off on birchbox
for a couple of months they really got
me with the laura geller highlighter I
got this month so beautiful and lots of
product yeah i'm going to stay
subscribed to birchbox I have no
intentions of stopping birchbox birchbox
has been very good to me as a brand and
I will I'm ride or die birchbox like I
will I am I've such a brand loyalty like
it would take a lot from you to
unsubscribe from Birchbox just because I
have a connection with the brand that
like III like they're one of the only
brands that to me they can do wrong but
I would still love them no I will still
love them even I mean they're trying
they're just trying I feel like birchbox
is just trying to do what they can to
sustain their business so I mean they're
doing they're doing everything they can
and you know I love it I love it um as
far as jeffree star i am going to be
doing the review of beauty killer pilot
i'm going to mostly folk
on the review of the palette I will
touch on how i feel about the drama I'm
going to touch on it but I'm not going
to spend most of the time on it Oh
cruelty-free karen says cruelty-free
thank you so much for that Karen I
appreciate that I just I don't know my
brain didn't click with it but i but i
can tell you i am really enjoying the
color palette i have there some hits and
misses and some things in there that i
want to mention but overall i'm enjoying
it it's going to be a positive review
for the beauty killer talent I'll tell
you that now Chris that says I'll still
buy stuff I can't get anywhere else from
the birch buckshot but i won't subscribe
anymore I look I do really like the
Birchbox shop definitely um let's see
he's anyone tried soap &amp;amp; Glory makeup I
haven't Cheryl I haven't tried it and
super quiche says is this foreplay box
worth getting I just got an email that
I'm off the waiting list i got it for
one month I thought it was kind of man
this month looked really good though
Delaney says uh that's who I was
thinking about saying that don't always
agree but all but good way to be
informed and for come to our jump you
can say that's koo but I don't know who
we were talking about i'm assuming
you're saying Tati that's what I'm
thinking because I it's like a it goes
too fast and I miss it Valerie says I
swapped my beauty killer cop for the
violet walls Holy Grail one haha but
girls I love my bullet violet balls holy
grail kalat I absolutely love it it's
great police he is getting her beauty
killer this month and Molly says what's
a good highlighter that is drugstore
I've heard really good things about
what's the big one the was it the wet
and wild one I honestly don't have like
this one is probably my favorite the
jcat beauty one and golden soleil this
is prime I favorite if you want a good
healers you might want to just get the
carli bybel palette like like this has
good highlighters and you saw those like
these swatched these are nice as
highlighters so that might be an option
for you this is the golden soul a baked
bronzer it says bronzer it's a highlight
this is coconut Island and I'll swatch
that for you this one's pretty nice this
one's great wet and wild highlighters
Billy says we reserve your cabana Thank
You Stephanie reserve your cabana I
don't own it I need to own it there's I
have to own reserve your cabana because
it's like everybody talks about all the
time and I don't own it
upsetting I don't really like the makeup
revolution highlighter even though a lot
of people do I'm getting hard pan on it
which is very weird i don't know why
it's just kind of spotty for me like
it's just not the kind of highlight that
i personally like helaina says you can
use a champagne eyeshadow for
highlighter that's very very true billy
says Oh Connie says how do you feel
about the prices on birchbox I'm hoping
they'll run sales since they're changing
the point system I think that they're
there no I don't think they're gonna run
cells they need to keep their heads
above water right now because they have
so much competition now between all of
the subscription boxes that they're
they're not going to run sales I don't
think they they have to they have to get
more profitable is what it comes down to
and the you know the point system really
gives people a lot of money back so you
know I don't think they're gonna do in
sales you know I I don't think they can
I don't think they can I mean this is
just the I even talked to anybody at
Birch box about it so this is just my
opinions even though I do have
connections at Birchbox like my major
connection which was Rachel she doesn't
work there anymore you know the girl
with the booklets just a girl the woman
with the dark brown hair that was in
lots of the videos she doesn't work
there anymore so she was my big
connection and now I'm tried to connect
with the new person but they never
emailed me back so i don't know but i
still feel loyalty to birchbox either
way because Rachel and I were like this
knowing part but I could email Rachel on
notice and you know we would chat so
they weren't best buds but we could chat
Catherine says is it harder to youtube
live the only imagine YouTube lives you
really have to watch what you say like
you have to really have your filter on
because you don't know like you don't
know who's watching it's me watch the
replay like you use really have to watch
what you're saying because the audience
is bigger here than it is on periscope
so and it's more likely people will be
able to find it so Catherine I you just
have to really watch what you say and
you have to be have your game face on on
a live for YouTube Billy says I think
depending your skin tone how you can
best use reserve your cabana okay good
to know good to know keeps going in and
out oh no oh no
oh I'm sorry that's a YouTube thing I
don't have any control over that I'm
sorry I apologize if you're watching
this in its skipping I apologize amanda
says I'm so said I have to go this was
the first shot is able to make and now
I'm even more determined to come next
week y'all have a good week oh we're not
coming back next week no more live chats
we're done after this week because I'm
going to be gone and we leave 10 minutes
left are you kidding me well we'll do 20
minutes cuz I came in 10 minutes late so
we'll do 20 minutes um okay it's fine
okay good ooh Tanya says if you have you
gone over the Becca eyeshadow issue what
are your thoughts on if you did a collab
and a company messed up all right jaclyn
hill we'll talk about this for a minute
so with jaclyn hill and the becca klab
this is my thing see I don't I don't I
her and this is what i heard that some
of the pallets I shadow palettes were of
high quality and some of them were not
of high quality if that is true i am
assuming they sent Jaclyn one of the
high quality palettes and then sent out
a bunch of junk pallets so if that is
true that is not Jacqueline's fault that
is the company's fault if they sent Jack
they if they were all of the same
quality and Jacqueline got a junk one
you would think she would have at least
swatched it and tried it before she sent
it out but at the same time if I'm
working with Becca I'm gonna trust that
Becca is doing what they were supposed
to be doing making sure that it's good
and maybe girlfriend got busy you know
and she's meant to do it and she forgot
but i'd be so stinkin excited I be
wearing it every day because I'd be so
excited you know but but she has a
different life than me she has a lot
more going on with the makeup stuff and
I than I do so I who am I to judge her
lifestyle and and what she had time to
do you know I feel like it was becos
responsibility to put out a good product
I don't think that's on Jacqueline I
think that's aunt Becca and it really
irks me that Becca would allow a product
to be made in a lab that they know is
substandard quality you know and and if
I work if
I were working with a brand like Becca I
would trust that if I was working with
like an nd brand that was I don't know
but any brands are putting reliable
overall because they're making kind of
their own stuff I don't know I don't
know man I just feel like that the
meeting the majority the
responsibilities on Becca as far as the
quality of the product that's just me
and I feel really bad that people are so
hard on her about it it's like almost
like like grave your girl when she was
coming up with the pilot this was cut
this was funny this made me laugh so
when she she was coming on the palate
she was like okay I just want to make
sure you guys know don't send me emails
if you're having or don't don't put
comments or expect me respond to emails
about you not getting your order and
it's like why in the world would would
would bunny be able to help you with
your ordering issues you know I mean
it's not like bunny sitting in her house
like packing these things up and sending
them out from her house you know what I
mean there's they have a promise s over
it hard to ship these out bunnies not
involved that it's the same thing with
jaclyn hill she's not involved in this
part she's only involved in the process
designing it you know any mean like
she's not involved in the whole like
manufacturing and and any of that she
just you know she's emailing back and
forth with people most likely i mean she
might have gone to them to the to meet
with people at Becca in person but
chances are she's probably just emailing
back and forth with them so i don't know
i just i just feel like if that's the
quality the product is on Becca I mean
overall I think everything's hot mopping
the brand and the collaborator it's just
kind of you know they're just a side
note you know there a way for them to
make more money I mean the reason why
Becca wants Jaclyn hill to do things for
them is because Jacqueline's gonna earn
them a ton of money you know like and
Jacqueline's make it off because
Jacqueline's gonna earn money off of it
too it's a mutual partnership it's a
business relationship and it's okay to
have business relationships within this
thing I mean we're not here just doing
this you know you can't you can't eat
kindness you can't pay your bills with
kindness and just oh you know and
I'm just gonna you know give away my
services for free you know I mean Datuk
imagine if doctors just said oh you know
you don't have to pay me to see you you
know and it you know if everything you
do as a job you have to get paid in one
way or another and that's the way she's
getting paid you know and I have no
problems with that I don't know I just
feel like Stephanie's like a nest out of
money I'm still getting used to stand
curse words and I don't know if I'm ever
gonna say curse words on the channel
just because I know that some kids watch
and stuff when some parents watch my
stuff with their kids and I feel funny
saying curse words on my channel I I
don't know maybe one day I might i'll
put like pg-13 as like I'm gonna say
curse words exactly i can curse on my
channel at this point but you know
Christmas says makeup companies need to
stop manufacturing and trying to save
money just um they'll just end up losing
money from the bad quality and reviews
that's good point Krista good point
Catherine says Jacqueline has been
getting so um beef edge so much me that
she almost deleted her channel and all
the other day cuz she didnt cuz all her
fans but yeah Jacqueline deleted her
channel over this oh my gosh that would
be like that would be on Jacqueline I
would be like no like that would that
would be I hate since but that would be
stupid that would be I'm just to throw
all of that away I mean it's not like
she couldn't build it back up but that's
like saying you know what I know I have
a million dollars but you know I'm just
gonna give it all the way I don't really
want this like it seemed like no you
don't give just give that away you know
you don't do that Valerie says I got a
custom Z palette with a supernatural
logo stamped on i'll post a picture
later I you in it yes that sounds so
awesome Valerie knows I'm a huge
supernatural fan on the TV show I love
it cousin says I curse like a sailor so
you won't offend me i know but sometimes
people watch their stuff with my stuff
with their kids and i don't want to do
that zephanie says you're right though i
think it comes down to the fact the
company should put out the products and
greet absolutely agreed and where I
really have issues with um with
companies putting our bad products is
the drugstore products that are bad it's
like I've said this before I don't say
it again like Revlon you know cover girl
it's like how long have you been in this
business
how long have you been making makeup
revlon covergirl how long have you been
doing this and you can't get a good eye
shadow palette out come on are you
serious are you serious like you think
that they would do better than that I
don't know karen says team Dean team
Dean sorry I supernatural again um as I
I don't even understand I don't I don't
I don't get how makeup company like
Revlon and cover girl can put out bad
products that's beyond me they're just I
mean guess it's just a money making
thing and they haven't caught on to the
quality equals more money look you put a
little more love in your products it'll
become holy ground status and
everybody's gonna buy it so Delaney says
who else thinks that who the heck
approved this for the show's didn't even
try this oh my gosh me too me too
Delaney I think the same thing super
quiche says random but glad you were
able to choose earrings for what's my
makeup news this weekend I had so much
trouble with rerun periscope and we had
this big debate over what earrings I was
gonna wear and you'll notice that I have
a feather in this year and I have a stud
in this year that was intentional I
already have people commenting where's
your other earring and it's like well we
were trying the whole you know mismatch
earring thing and some people will get
it and some people will not get it it's
only for one week so just so you know I
do have an earring in both years it's
just supposed to be like the mismatch
earring thing I don't know we tried it
we tried it Valerie says tell me how
Alma is still even a thing you know
what's funny as I was walking by the
almay section and I was like does this
friend even exist anymore because no one
talks about it every and there's only
one product of El me that I can square
by and that's the get up and grow
mascara that mascara is super super fab
i love the Alma yet up and grow it is
really good I haven't bought it in a
couple of years but I remember just
really loving that my scare I should
repurchase that just to make sure I
still love it but a couple years ago it
was like oh I learned about it from
emilynoel83 and then I i bought it and I
was like oh my gosh something's like the
most amazing mascara ever so I really
should read by that but other than that
hasn't really put out anything notable
you know Michelle says they know that
people without I lost it without the
experience or knowledge will buy it
that's true they'll buy it because of
the packaging kind of like it was on
that blue mascara it was like a pink to
you i think was covergirl and it was
just gorgeous pink packaging it was like
oh my gosh i bought it and I hated it
was just pink was pink Marilyn says I'm
with 20 nice she'd be clean and no
cursing really yeah and I'm probably
gonna end up sticking to that unless
there's a there might be videos where I
say specifically that it's going to be
you know a little more raw but I'll warn
you ahead of time a warning ahead of
time jenna says I'm obsessive
supernatural supernatural Zaza I love
that show amanda says I can't use almay
mascaras they make my eyes water like
crazy oh no Elena says I don't get it
either how coming like Revlon that owns
companies like Elena Rubenstein can't
make decent shadows I know I don't get
it I don't get it Caroline says I do not
like drugstore makeup I don't even waste
time with it and you know that's why I
think there's that people like Jessica
jam you Nadine I have so much success
doing drugs or videos because you really
have to find that needle in the haystack
and there are some really excellent
drugstore products especially drugstore
mascaras I feel like that really are
standout products but you really have to
weed through all of the crack to get to
the good stuff so when he says i buy one
Jen says it's go to all thank you Ezra
says I use the Elm a foundation for
years old and I lost it went up to hi ho
must have felt me go back up there
where's okay i used the elm a foundation
for years when I had super oily
sensitive skin but now that I've got dry
skin sadly nothing oh no um okay here
and says we should have a night wine
chat yes we should now that I can have a
glass of wine on camera that would be
super fab that'd be nice Christmas does
Emily by wet and wild and Rimmel since
they're super cheap and unlike the
quality you know what I want to get is I
want to get that the physicians formula
the bronzer that everybody's talking
about but it's so expensive so i'm
waiting to find it like a forty percent
off sale to get that cuz i really want
to get that but I want to get reserve
your cabana I need it now excuse me I
need reserve your cabana now let's see
Barbara says Maybelline makeup remove
is not great um it says al al Baline but
I think you might mean abling makeup
remover is great nah tell me though
Valerie says you can say the name of
that gold shade of beauty killer toilet
now say it no I'm not going to say
another but you're right I can't in that
video I will say it in the video Tanya
says I only buy certain brands from the
drugstore rim wet and wild and Milani
yeah and I found really great products
from l'oreal I feel like L'Oreal
especially their eyeshadows tend to be
really good overall I really like the
Loreal infallible I think they're super
awesome um 70 said that I need you need
to reserve the Cabana I do and Tony says
I can't spend 14 99 on that bronzer on
the the positions form of the bronzer I
can't either that's why I'm looking for
a 40-percent I'll say yourself that's
like rich female dog it's the name of
the shade in in the beauty killer caught
us the gold one I'm not going to say it
right now because I'm not prepared I
don't prepare the audience for that but
this one right here is rich female dog
as the name Krista says L'Oreal's
expense though it is oh definitely is um
karen says I can say a different word
yeah cuz I could say a different version
of it um Jordana best lash extreme
mascara super Fab um the essence
mascaras super fab I need to try I
really need to chill out on the high end
stuff and get more drug store stuff
that's why i got those revlon eyeliners
but i bought way too much high-end
lately and i need to go back the
drugstore route this is thing about the
drugstore route is I don't like
reviewing things that are mediocre I
like reviewing things that are either
really good or really bad things that
are in the middle it's like that's okay
you know like I felt like the Milani
foundation was just kind of okay and I
didn't Utley have much to say about it I
didn't love it I didn't hate it it was
just kind of man you know so I don't
know I don't know I want to do more drug
store reviews though I definitely want
to beef up the drugstore reviews on the
channel absolutely that's a priority
Michelle says watch for the buy one get
one free at rite aid they run at least
once a month yes absolutely i need to do
that Tanya says that too much makeup
right now I'm gonna know by until the
Black Moon trio comes out nice Marilyn
says I guess if you have dark
get the Physicians Formula bronzer won't
show I have no idea no idea I would love
to know on someone with the deeper skin
tone their comments on that Valerie says
that's what I'm working on to more drug
store less Sephora yes definitely um
Jenny says L'Oreal eyeliners are fab yes
agreed Margaret says when when you get
back from vacation our chats resume and
yes they will I'm and if you want to do
more chatting while i'm on vacation
follow me on periscope because this is
this is what we do on periscope as we
chat a lot so and i will be periscoping
a lot from vacation so if you want to
stay up to date on things definitely
follow me there because that's that's
the best way for me to keep in touch
with you guys i'll also be on our
facebook group on what's up and make up
the facebook group so it's on groups /
what's up and make up that's another
place that i'll be frequenting i want to
beef up the app i want to talk to the
app creators the what so to make up ab
and try to make that better and then
once that at the app is a little bit it
needs to be more user friendly and needs
it needs a lot more features i need to
talk to them about how we can make the
appt better and you know then i'll be
over there more but the biggest place to
find me is going to be on periscope
while i'm on vacay so Julia says I hope
to see a palette done by you one day I
would love to do a palette I would love
to do a collab one day I mean I have
50,000 subscribers which is a lot but in
the world of collaborations 50,000
subscribers is a drop in the bucket
compared to the people that are doing
with collaborations mean when you're
talking about a mani and a Kathleen and
a Jaclyn I mean it's like there's so
many of us they have 50,000 subscribers
so I mean I'm very I it's not really
about the numbers for me like I really
feel like like I heard Michelle Phan say
this are there's a if you've never
listened to beauty and the vlog it is a
podcast you definitely need to listen to
it eriko repeating the vlog did one
about her experience of generation
beauty and she talked about it she had
like a meet and greet thing with
Michelle Phan and she said something
about you know Michelle said that it's
about the relationship you develop with
your community that is more important
than the subscriber numbers and i feel
like i have absolutely rocked the
relationship with you guys and I that's
my favorite part I love hanging
you guys are talking to you guys so even
though I might not have you know a
million subscribers I feel like we are
so close and we you know hang out so
much that it's like I feel like that's
the value for me so that's just me Susan
says gotta run Jen have a great vacation
so excited for you thank you susan by
susan when he says I wish I'd received a
response to my post but giving it time
Oh what did you say I missed it I'm
sorry if I miss your post if you drop
the gym or if you dropped a question
definitely when this video renders which
is about 15 minutes after the video ends
Emily drop it in the comment section
below and then i'll try to answer it
there try to talk to you there I
definitely don't want to ignore you i
just can't keep up it's too fast I can't
keep up makeup mom says did not show my
show on my face I'm not better oh are
you talking about the reserve your
cabana she said that it's to instant
she's not that dark and doesn't show on
her face Jackie says what are you on
missed it Jackie says what are you going
to do with your dog while your God he's
staying at my parents house my parents
have a really big backyard they have a
dog he gets along really well so he's
gonna stay over there which it's a huge
blessing because y'all know kennels are
expensive especially for three to four
weeks so we're not King we're gonna
bring them gifts and stuff but we're not
gonna have to pay anything which is
fantastic Christmas says you could
collab with indie brand or a brand I've
never heard of and I would still buy
yourself but this is the thing if I put
my name on something it better be
amazing like I am NOT putting my name on
something that one hundred percent
believe in like I gotten an offer from
real style you've heard of real style I
haven't heard much about real style
recently but our EE L style um they had
wanted me to do makeup with them and
when I read the contract and I looked at
it and I was like oh this is not because
I was nervous that it wasn't going to be
good quality and I don't want to put my
name on something that was not good
quality so I ditched it i was like no we
got like half way through the process
and it came from me signing the contract
I was like mm-hmm because I just got a
bad feeling you know when you get that
if feeling in your stomach like this is
a really bad idea that's kind of how it
went with real style I'm not saying that
they're bad like there are lots of
videos saying they're bad but I don't
have enough experience with them from
personal experience to say that they're
bad I just know that I did not have
I did not feel like that was something I
wanted to do because I didn't like the
contract um but I wanted I will not put
my name on something that is something i
don't believe in a hundred percent you
know i love the collab with his geek
chic cosmetics EG cosmetics i wanted a
collab with forever because i love their
shadows that would be stinking amazing
but i don't think they would clap with
me because it's like I I don't feel like
you know i'm not i'm not that level yet
you know like where brands are gonna
look at me and take me seriously but
they just don't understand us they just
don't get us and how special we are and
how special you are they don't
understand one day maybe 10 Zoe says so
is this last live chat ever or just as
you get back from vacation just so I get
back from vacation we will be doing live
chats again when i get back in a month I
just can't I don't know what my Wi-Fi is
gonna be like so I don't I'm scared and
do say I'm gonna do a live chat when I
don't know what my Wi-Fi is gonna be
like when he said all so I did a
periscope I did you periscope with you
for a while jet oh awesome one DJ and
krista says um instant isn't real saw
the one that everyone has done videos
about saying bad things about them um
yes I did for a Vanessa from that is rad
did polishes with them she was not happy
this is to Melissa MLM PHS she did her
subscription box with them um so yeah I
don't think melissa has outright said
she had a bad experience though melissa
says Melissa Hammond says I lean toward
drugstore mascara specially Maybelline
mascaras I've tried better than sex it
didn't like it tried their real didn't
like it either best results with
Maybelline mascaras yeah I like my
Maybelline mascara is I'll tell you my
favorite ones are these I love these
these are super fab these are really
good the lash sensational and the last
sensational luscious it's really just
the one difference I feel like the black
ones a little clumpy ER but those are
really good and like I said before the
Jordana and the essence ones are really
good too um really really nice they
don't get the love Nancy says I know I
agree I agree carolyn says steel as huge
mascaras my new favorite yes the huge
mascara is really really good i agree

physicians formula butter bronze or I
have a good tan

a heartbeat I love me some julep I don't
you know small potatoes man or small
potatoes and that's okay I'm cool with
that because I have you guys so anyone
know good drugstore Duke for better than
sex mascara I wouldn't I be hesitant to
say something when I haven't put it I
die Valerie says I like the Maybelline
rocket mascara remember that one yes
that's Melissa I'm FML mph esas that's
her favorite so I remember learning
about that from her the new head super
my hair mascara is fantastic my friend
sahaja who I'm not sure I haven't seen
her in the chat sahaja but sahaja sent
me a sample of it and I am enjoying me
where is it you know what is quite in my
bastard I have a basket of things that I
need to make sure that i'm using right
here she sent me the sample of the
superhero mascara by at cosmetics and i
feel like the people who are going to
like this the most other people that
already have lots of lashes we're
looking for length this is fantastic for
length oh my gosh and the more i use it
the more I'm loving it so I'm not
prepared to review it yet because I feel
like as its aging is getting even better
like I feel like every time I use it it
gets just a little bit better so I'm not
quite ready to review it but if you're
looking for length this one is a really
really really good one debs saying
benefit roller lash that one feels
really heavy on me I don't know why it
just feels heavy Margaret says I hated
the superhero really and Mia says what
do you think of the new toothpaste peach
eyeshadow palette I do own the Too Faced
peach proud I have a full review on all
those pallets I feel like the peach is
for me the one that I like the least of
the toothpaste palettes but it's not a
bad palette it's good palate but it's
one that I I'd Emily reach for the least
out of the two-faced palettes that I own
um thinner those Oh Samantha Riley's
here just stay away from the new
Charlotte Tilbury mascara legendary
glasses for rendus for 32 bucks oh my
goodness really I saw that you put up
your Charlotte Tilbury if you want

Riley she's super fab um k Swift says I
love BTS effect on my bed and sexist
effect on my lashes it just flakes all
over my face oh no i've heard that from
other people without it flaking to care
says I just like the toothpaste peach
palette I was so pissed about it and I
honestly like I do like it it's a good
parallel it's just not super fab I can't
