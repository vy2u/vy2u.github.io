chant on Sundays we do this every Sunday
at 10 a.m. Eastern Time for the most
part we try to do some 5 p.m. chats
where people that can't make it at 10
a.m. but most of them are at 10 a.m.
Eastern Time today is a very special
chat because I'm doing a bit of an
experiment with super chat and I did say
I was going to turn super chat on
anymore but I decided to change my mind
because I have an idea and my idea is is
that because we are the collective brain
but maybe we could come together to do
some good in donating some money to
charities that need help right now so I
found this charity and I did some
research on it and I decided that this
would be a really good place to start
because I don't think it's been getting
a lot of media attention so I thought
that would be good and it's such a cool
concept it's called the shoe that grows
and you may have seen this in I saw I've
learned about it out on Facebook and I
know and not Facebook on on Twitter
which isn't always the most reliable
source so I did some digging and digging
and digging and I looked for negative
reviews anything negative anybody had to
say about this company this this
nonprofit and I couldn't find anything
so I figured that was a good sign that
we were doing something good so this app
is gonna work watch any type of the
shoot of those and basically what they
invented was this shoe that it grows
with the kid it grows up to five sizes
there's three sizes all together that
grows from infant were like tiny either
walking age so like 1 all the way up to
adult size but they're specifically for
kids could you not get big kid speak to
that and basically what happens is these
kids in places even in the United States
and there's places all over the world
where kids are walking barefoot they get
any diseases and they're getting sick
because of not having proper shoes they
grow out of the donated shoes very
quickly and this is a way for them to
have shoes grow longer between the time
they almost look like sandals with
little buttons and let me show you see
if I can show you on my phone what they
look like trying to find like a good
picture of them
there's pictures not good shoes but they
basically got these like little snaps
that they can snap it on snap I'd find a
good picture
they'd snap it on snap and they velcro
to grow with the child and I just
thought that was such a good concept so
what we're going to do is we are going
to donate any super cheque money that is
donated to does take a cut of that I
will cover the cop the cost of that cut
so whatever you don't like say you you
donate ten dollars I forget what
YouTube's cut is I will make up the
difference of whatever YouTube would
have taken and then any money that I
make off of Adsense from this video will
go directly to the shoe that grows so
and then I'll put it up somewhere I look
on Twitter or on Instagram somewhere
I'll put up how much money we donated at
the collective brain I wish you could
find a good picture of the shoes you see
I can find the all they're showing on
the on the local site is like the
pictures of the divvied up shoes but I
thought that would be really cool like
instead of like saying you know getting
you can donate money to the channel it's
for me to buy more product I don't
honestly I don't really need that right
now like I'm good but my husband is
doing well in his business like I mean
of course I could always use my money
everybody could use my money
okay let's be honest everybody but a lot
of people can can use one life so you
know but I don't I don't need it you
know what I mean like I'm fine I'm doing
okay I'm doing fine why can't it bonus
to picture of the shoe this is really
bothering me because I brought up the
website ahead of time like okay I'll
just show the picture okay here we go
there's a kind of a picture shouldn't
see the little boy has got the shoes on
there's the little like little clasps
there and they grow with the child and
if you have any suggestions for for
charities that you would like to journey
to the future definitely those in the
comments below
you're hearing live chat just wait on
that for a minute because I'd rather you
put it in the comments below so that I
have it saved because I can't save the
chat we have a very rudimentary way of
saving for a chat so I'd rather they be
in the comments below so let's go ahead
and look and see oh my gosh this is
awesome already got some donations
coming in
from AJ and from Tam and from step and
from Jess thank you so much for the
donations for the shoe that grows that's
so awesome
another idea I put up on I know this
isn't what this video was about I'm
sorry but we'll get to it in just a
second another idea I had was that you
know youtubers that are like
up-and-coming they needed upgrades if
they're filming set up maybe we could
donate money to help them upgrade their
filming setups something like that I
don't know if that's up but there are
people on Twitter that we're like no
absolutely not so I thought it'd be
better to do like a legit really cool
charity first and then we'll kind of see
where it goes so I will be thanking
people as I see them donate but remember
the money is not going to me it's going
directly to the shoot occurs I promise
and I will put like I said I'll put up
the and the people are so worried about
shady like donations and things lately
and that freaks me out but I promise you
I will put it up on Twitter and/or on
Instagram how much money you collect all
together so let's go ahead and stop for
we just got another donation from Rachel
thank you so much Rachel I appreciate
the $5 thank you so much I think it's 15
dollars per pair so that's like a third
of a pair of shoes like three of you
just did a pair of shoes together for a
kid for five years like that's so cool
okay so anyway let's say hello to the
people that are here all together in the
beginning uh oh my gosh they've got more
donations than the I'll go thank him in
just a moment make me actually use this
here Gigi it frisbee is here the liz is
here Teresa M o is here
like diamonds and pearls Megan one of
our wonderful wonderful she's like admin
team Megan like she's like awesome like
she she does reporting and she does all
kinds of really cool stuff this show
Thank You Megan for being here reading
mom is here amber is here Vicki Jennifer
and Becky and everybody else is here
thank you so much
Shelby thank you so much for the
donation Felicia and Denise thank you so
much I really appreciate your donation
Danielle thank you so much for your
donation this is really cool all right
so let me go ahead and start a flying
make up I got about five hours of sleep
last night so I'm a little off I'm just
gonna grab a random foundation I'm not
even gonna grab a face primer who's
gonna grow up around a foundation this
is the surely speedy cream which I've
been absolutely loving surprisingly but
my oh my god well yeah so anyway thank
you so much Val thanks for the donation
if you don't like me saying thanks for
the donation then you're probably in the
wrong watching today I'm really sorry
it's probably gonna be happening quite a
bit we've already I think people donated
over $100 at this point which is in red
oval okay so anyway I gotta find hours
to sleep last night from doing the
getting ready for what's up in makeup
and getting all of that ready I spent
the day over at my mother-in-law's house
with my husband's family thank you so
much for the donation Amanda
thank you I spend the day my
mother-in-law's house with his family so
I was like trying to edit in the corner
and I got carsick and we were editing at
a rest up while we ate like gas station
dinner at sheets on the way back to
Pennsylvania so I'm a little bit off
today a little bit off but anyway back
to the topic of the video we have
perfusion makeup this was all set to me
by the fusion but this is not a
sponsored video they just sent me a
bunch of stuff and I saw that taunting
had liked a lot of it so I thought that
was pretty cool that she had enjoyed it
but I was like you know what I really
want to try to myself and I can get me
super clean up to try it on camera with
you so we can decide together whether
it's worth it or not because a lot of
this stuff is like ten dollars you know
for um for some of these big huge giant
pallets but you can use ten dollars
still ten dollars women spend 10 dollars
on something that's not good so we'll
see what happens there
so I'm so like all over the place today
but thank you so much everybody that's
donated so far AJ donate fifty donated
$50 and who is this this is Denise
donated $20 thank you so much and
Felicia donated ten and thank you to all
the $5 donations as well
Megan says I always see profusion
projects products at Marshalls and
t.j.maxx they do sell them at Marshalls
and he came back they also sell them
there's a petition website and then
there's they sell it at Target online
either they do sell them at some targets
in store some people have told me as
well Deborah says I'm not seeing a
donation button that's really weird it
should be in the chat that's so weird at
least $15 thank you so much to our
wonderful reporter Lee thank you so much
I'm just grabbing this cure we're
setting up a base may look like Nicolas
thank you so much for the donation I
appreciate that and waiting for your
super check you know I'm really excited
about it
there are so many things to donate to I
mean like I was thinking you know Puerto
Rico is still oh thank you be Souter
$30.00 thank you so much we just bought
two pairs of shoes for two kids for five
years that's pretty amazing there's so
many places mean like Porto Rico is
still having so much trouble if we could
do like a Puerto Rico donation to find a
good cherry you know the mudslides in
California are crazy I just heard that
there was a huge earthquake and now
there might be a tsunami I mean it's
just unbelievable there's so many places
to journey but I thought this would be a
quick fun first one okay so now that
we've got that on let's go ahead and go
into brows so this is pretty new this is
the defined brows professional brow set
when we open this up and I haven't even
opened it yet looks like this Kim says
did the video starts it says waiting on
my screen if someone could stop her
please go out and come back in Oh Cindy
says I'm gonna I've had no donations I
know me
Oh doll face hello thank you so much for
your donation I appreciate that you can
suggest the nonprofits in the comments
down below
after this video after this video
renders where did I say that there was
an earthquake it was like a 7.8 in Peru
in Peru there was a 7.8 magnitude and
then there's a tsunami warning for them
okay so anyway Shan says I want to
donate but I have an iPhone would be a
link on the Facebook group to donate as
well I can probably set something like
that up I thought that this this is like
a way that I'm just gonna take all the
money and donate it myself
but we can calmly set up it won't be on
the Facebook page because that isn't
with our group rules and I don't want to
set a bad precedent Oh Georgia thank you
so much for that YouTube takes 30
percent of super chats goodness gracious
okay they don't use any cut okay we
don't take any oh yeah look at into
setting up stream labs you don't take
any cut gotcha
like twitch thank you so much Alicia for
your for your donation I appreciate that
it's okay I mean it's one of those
things where you know we'll be good
yeah all right I mean if this doesn't
work out with whether it's too much for
me to cover or is like YouTube's cut of
it then I'll work well I'll probably
able to work it out I don't know Missy
but work out this time I definitely will
but I might have to reconsider that if
it gets too high because it might get a
little spoonful okay so let's talk about
what we've got here in this product
thank you so much Angela Angela just
bought a pair of shoes okay well I say
that let me let me go back to the
perfusion web site so this I know I'm
all over the place today I'm so sorry
for trying to watch this as a functional
video it's just not functional okay so
this is the new brow kit I want to say
this is $10 and it comes with one two
three four five shades you get two
pencils here I guess this is a wax
crayon here a spoolie brush with an
angled brush of hair tweezers and then
some brow arch stencils so I think what
we're gonna do is let's go ahead and try
the brow powders go back over to the
chat I want to the diffuse your website
for a second
okay um slim high arch I don't know if I
good I bought the ant aunty once after
seven either full recommended them and I
just haven't used them like I I just
they work really well for her and I
think it just has to do with like
whether you have browser and on I feel
like if you don't have if you don't have
a lot of Browns these things are a lot
more functional but if you actually have
hairs that kind of guide you there to go
I don't think I'm gonna mess with the
brow banks we will do though pence me
but ago the brush though so let's go
ahead and so the first one is highlight
then blonde the medium brown the
chocolate brown an ash brown so I'm
gonna use the excuse me ash brown which
is the one before you can see that the
one over there running out hands here
feel like ash brown apology I don't know
it's really great how many she's the
bottom while the ash brown me that's
really powdering I wasn't expecting
expecting it to be very dry that's nice
it's thinking straight down to the skin
it doesn't seem to be sticking in the
air new I got fall out that might be my
fault
well try not to have fall out on the
next I know complaints there and this is
not going to be a phone of you this is
just the first impression I'll show you
the fall out in a second
not thought that the powder kicked up on
them now it which can be a good thing in
that you know if oh the Karen thank you
so much with the donation I appreciate
that I use the spotter when you see that
powder kick up there but that isn't
necessarily a bad thing is that such a
funny ruler it's not necessarily a bad
thing as far as the performance but if
that bothers you as far as wasting
product and things like that then you
might not like that I'm going to try to
scoop up a little bit of that on my
brush this brush is very nice it's very
stiff sometimes brow brush is especially
inexpensive brow brushes I finally try
to make them too soft and then they're
not
but this is working very very well this
color is perfect for me the only thing
about a brow palette thing that I don't
like is that we really only have one
maybe two three top shades that we could
possibly use on our brows I've never
really heard of anybody using blue
shades in the brow some people use a
lighter shade in inner corner and a
darker shade you know further out I
personally like just the darker shade
throughout I probably should start
trying to do the lighter shade in the
middle and in the diversity through the
rest but you have to use all these
colors you know I mean Amy Oh Gigi
wanted to know if their full price of
teaching max I would imagine I mean this
is ten dollars for all this you get a
lot of stuff I would imagine a full-size
I drop the crayon I can get here without
okay I want to use a wax crayon and see
how it is you said that palette would
last a lifetime
I know right and it's also it's very
large so if you don't have a lot of
storage probably not oh I don't like
that yes if you don't a lot of storage
these palettes it might be better for
like gifting for people that don't have
a lot of makeup if you have a lot and
they've got this feels like it's gonna
hold my brows really well but it's very
heavy yeah I can feel it like wax on my
eyebrows if my eyebrows feel like
they're stuck to my face almost like
that put glue on my brows that they feel
really heavy I don't let that relax at
all I mean honest says why do you feel
that you should try to use more colors
in your brows well they say that if you
use a lighter color in the inner part it
just doesn't look as harsh and it looks
one natural that's the that's the idea
behind it
that's letter D says feeding it that up
will help the application you know I
think honestly I think it's too soft I'm
not sure if it's oh I saw some donated
some donations went through that I
missed one on a second
no Karen okay cameras last one there's a
lot those bigger donations laughs a
really long time on the screen it's
supposed to hold your brows in place
press one you know em Chris says never
heard of a wax pencil it's very soft I
would be very hesitant to keep this
because I would have be afraid it would
melt
Skyler thank you so much for the
donation so I don't know I'm starting to
not feel as bad anymore but I don't like
heavy wax I like the lighter wax that's
just my personal preference okay um the
tweezers look you look pretty nice I
mean you can buy a pair of tweezers he's
just possible like five bucks on their
own so if these are good tweezers they
feel a little bit stiff but if these are
good tweezers then you're getting you
know half your cost and just the
tweezers on the try to tweak a little
bit and see piecework yeah it worked fun
it work well definitely I mean they work
like you know regular Revlon users or
whatever they'll pay five six bucks for
it it's stored so these are good cool so
there's you know if you're gonna use the
tweezers you get everything else kind of
for five bucks bonus let me go ahead and
swatch these guys right here and see how
these pencils are oh nice okay so let me
tell you what I look for in a brow
pencil when I look for a brow pencil I
want to go on easily but I don't want to
be too thick and cakey because if it's
too pigmented if it's too waxy it'll get
stuck in the brows and just look like a
mess so I want to be light but not too
light I want it to be invented for not
too pigmented it's kind of like the way
I am with my blush one thing I can tell
right away that's gonna be a problem is
this top is coming off extremely easily
there's no way to really get it to go on
its color soft brown by the way so
that's gonna be a problem if you want to
keep it outside of the case that is a
big problem because that that top is not
going to stay
you do the set that one oh yeah these
are nice brow pencils cuz they look like
something that you can but you can build
up so that's cool I'm so so far from
first impression I think this would
definitely be worth ten dollars but it's
huge so you know that might be a
deal-breaker for you right there
but I think there's a noting here that
because this definitely work that price
I wish I could find it exactly on the
website when you make sure that it's
time to that's gonna bother me if I said
this whole time it was ten and then it
ended up being something different
yep there it is defined brows the
artistry palette and it is $10 and
there's three reviews on their website
right now for it it's got two five stars
and then one three stars three star
person says the plastic shaper are big
oh the she's talking about the her name
is Jonah Beth she's talking about these
guys right here are big I don't think I
would use those that's just my personal
okay if I knew exactly where the Anasazi
what once were I would show this to you
and compare sometime honestly not a
hundred percent sure where they are and
I don't want to waste time at that let's
put that go ahead and put that down and
then we're going to go into the eye
shadow I've got this big eye shadow
palette this is the sultry 24 shade
eyeshadow palette and it does come with
a double-sided brush oh the brow brush
in there is also very nice so even these
choose the tweezers and the brow brush I
think that's worth ten dollars just that
personal trash pile think about to chat
okay Ashley says the LA girl brow pencil
is amazing that's great to know another
reason why I wanted to do this video
speaking of that while ago yet now
shadow primer is that I've been getting
some critiques lately that I have not
been doing enough drugstore priced
product so my channel so I thought this
would be a great way to not only high
like to think that perfume sent me so
that they can feel like they sent it to
me for a reason
but also to put some drugstore stuff on
my channel because the profusion at this
point is setting so much stuff I feel
like I want to you know
thank them bus by showing them to you at
least giving them a good honest Ron okay
so if I'm the eyes with primer potion
Urban Decay primer potion let me see
what you all are saying Susan says I
think was makeup struggles just
recommended Sephora brow pencil was
really great that's awesome you know
what I really like the Sephora eyeliners
the pencil eyeliners Alyssa says for
Fusion is at five below as well great
thank you so much for that okay so let's
go ahead and see what this brush is like
that's in here okay so we've got a
pretty flat shader brush that's not too
bad
it's very thin though so I'm not sure
how that's gonna pick up product we're
just gonna use this brush to apply and
then we've got a relatively fluffy brush
mirror we've already got some loose
hairs going on in here or it's just not
cut it looks like it's just not cut well
there's some hairs that are sticking up
out of the brush which can easily be
trimmed but that's up mm-hmm but yeah
it's just very thin but we're gonna try
it we're gonna try it Nia wants to know
if they have colorful palettes I'm
actually not quite sure well this was
pretty colorful but if you go to
profusion calm I guess it per feet
perfusion cosmetics calm they have all
of their stuff there okay so let's go
ahead and start
dr. Charlie lost the first second I got
it website P these products is perfusion
cosmetics calm and I do not benefit from
your purchase I don't have enough the
late limp or anything down it's just you
know but if you want to get them cool if
not cool oh my gosh look how much
product I barely gently rolled my brush
in that this is my first time using for
fusion eyeshadows that's the shade zing
right here and then use that completely
rainbow says perfusion self again
insurance company
so the brush is a little bit longer than
I like it's bending a little too much
for the density of it it's comforting
this guide like what I like but I feel
like it's kind of like me and it's not
giving me like though it's blending very
nicely but it's not giving me the bend
that I personally like and used to so I
try to keep it a little bit on this side
and then I try to make it bigger on the
outside I've been watching some makeup
tutorials trying to improve my skills
okay so that went on not at all julik
thank you so much for the donation
twenty-five dollars we've just bought a
pair of shoes and almost to complete
pairs of shoes where kids in need it
broke my heart seeing those kids walking
around with these feet up looking shoes
you know their feet sticking out the
backs of these crocks and stuff it's
craziness okay I really wish I had a
smaller brush okay so what we're gonna
do hmm
okay we're gonna use this shade risky
and I'm just gonna barely tap into the
side of anything these are pigmented
these these have a lot of pigment I'm
just gonna tap like that on this side
and tap like that on this side so now
I've learned as far as the donation
thing that's the problem had an
additional donation spot the people that
are watching on the replay or people
that are on mobile we can't donate that
you could go off the planet studied for
next time this is just the first time
I've done this so that actually looks
really pretty so now and my camera on my
I'm filming on my iPad webcam so it's
really not the best camera I should get
a nicer webcam for things like this
all right so now I need to figure out
what I wanted to with my lid I'm wearing
my tailor from that table my my feeling
was it human Oh
freakin put all of this I don't think I
can wear this to my nephew's birthday
party later well I guess I'll be still
with my jacket want to drop the kids off
now when I notice it's the one my
freaking ball shirt so it's purple so
let's do purple lid let's do like these
two lately
erielle thank you so much for the
donation we're gonna do these two right
here and kind of create a look a cat eye
as Whitney Hendricks calls it it's three
wishes we'll put that in the inner
corner that is really pretty
I am shocked and how pretty this is
I really had very low expectations
because like you know like like well
when won't have some good ones but I'm
thinking more like like hard candy and
stuff like that like some use eyeshadow
palettes elf and f palettes there it's
so bad
there's so bad and these are the same
price point you know what it won't have
some good ones are these them well it's
building those things there are these
most shimmery eyeshadows ever no but
it's been a really nice thing I am
there's magic this is $10 because you
know when you buy some of those like
covergirl like I shadow palettes and
stuff they were like now they're inching
up on like $20 for like the L'Oreal
palette like this you get like three
times as many shades and it's half the
price Joan wants to know if it's cruelty
free I should have looked that up yes
cruelty free
it's on the back cruelty free
distributive a book of ability you can
see where it where it's made in made in
PR OC People's Republic of China but it
does say cruelty free and then in case I
always get this question all the time
about cruelty free and China and whether
something can be cruelty free and made
heard me say this many times I do
apologize and going into the bewitched
shade which is that shimmery purple you
can make something in China oh that's
not staying purple it's pretty good
that's it but just so you notice purple
does not stay purple it's got a great
undertone which is very common with
their goals but you can't manufacture
something to China and have a ki-43 as
long as you don't sell it in China so
that's what it looks like is happening
here and it happens with a lot of brands
shop hunters like that with the nut shop
hush
what is it Doug the pallets that you buy
it shop hush those are like that bad
habit the bad habit ones
Judy is place those are all I switch my
color appropriately those are all made
in the People's Republic of China but
they're all pointy free products that
are sold to the people of China have to
be tested Hamill's yes correct
if they were made in me and if they were
made outside of China I believe is Balu
I'm not sure if it's made but like it's
a Chinese brand I don't know if they
have to test on animals I'm not sure
honest that blended really nicely let me
get closer so nice to see Jamie wants to
know the name of this mirror it's made
by simple human you can buy it bad back
from God with your 20% off coupon that's
what I always tell people no he don't
buy a full price but it's really good
it's been like a total game to different
so but it is pricing Rihanna loss to
know if I got my English lucky bag no um
Steph says Jen for the 30% I think we'd
be okay with you keeping the 30% of
donation to cover that since none of us
knew yeah I don't know I I'm gonna have
to see how much it is if it's ridiculous
the 30% I might use some of it but I
don't know I feel like I've I've said it
was going to use you know the 30% I was
gonna cover it I didn't realize was 34
sighs I thought it was like 10%
yeah we'll see what happens I think
it'll be okay
Oh Kali be okay at least for this one
it'll be fun I just don't want I don't
want more money to go to YouTube you
know what I mean
like I don't like that I don't want that
I think that's not stuff to do money
without YouTube okay so now we've got
this shape candy I'm gonna put that on
the brow bone this little messy hair is
off the top of the brush it bugging me
whoo that is so good I can't even
believe it I'm gonna do a couple of
finger swatches after I'm done putting
this on I seriously can't believe how
smooth that's going on no that's really
pretty I came out as a really pretty
little little law Jesus said I can't
donate I can donate to Jen I'll cover
thirds if that's a big juicy don't worry
about that sweetheart it'll be fine I
can cover it it's okay I don't want
anybody to worry about 50% I will cover
it it's not a big deal
I will work it out some it'll be okay
it'll be all right shiny thing says I'm
a little late to the party but hi Jen
you're my favorite youtubers I like to
tune into all thank you my first time
making 20 of your live chats will
welcome shiny things
welcome welcome okay so let's go ahead
and put a little bit on the lower lash
line I want to use a different color
let's use this sheet strong over here to
the shimmery Wow
you kind of put that in the outer corner
down over here let's see lateralis wants
to know if this is supposed to be deep
for another palette I don't believe so
really are going on very nicely these
inexpensive brands are catching on that
you really don't have to spend a lot of
money to make a really good product I'm
going to use this shade gleam it's right
above the three watches that I've used
before just for the UM the inner corner
my my lower lash line is to agree I am
shocked
I asked I shocked I was seriously
expected come on can I be like a new not
worth ten dollars
but that's worth ten dollars that's my
thought on this family worth ten dollars
I would pay like if I knew this was
drugstore and I was going to the
drugstore and I saw this and I knew that
it was good quality I would pay $25 for
this but the quality is good it's just
as good my Too Faced palettes I think is
it as good as my Urban Decay getting
close to some of them maybe not all of
them but really good mostly i buy two
face because the packaging is really
cute
I bought all of the baggage again I can
stop okay eyeliner I don't have an
eyeliner let's just want the brow
countries they don't have an eyeliner
then we use the darker brow pencil which
may be a little bit difficult because I
like my brow pencil it might my eyeliner
is a little creamier than my brow
pencils so we'll see what happens here
we still gonna be something and I don't
have a mascara yeah that's not gonna
work okay
22 we're gonna use a dark eyeshadow that
pencil if not it's not intense enough
for an eyeliner for me Cindy
Cynthia says when you when you're done
can you tell us the ingredients concern
from my mature skin would be to drawing
okay let's look and see so we've got tap
this right here is Tom and Mike the base
and then kaylynn which is a clay if
Kalin is pretty high up on here
silicon magnesium stearate at Paxil
palmitate
too - excellent
I know the differences between that in
the regular one happy looking Catholic
triglyceride phenoxyethanol fragrant's
making team different pigments blah blah
blah let me see if there's any and
looking see if there's any hormone or
any other concerning pigments no they're
all pretty typical off to look at the
iron oxide bread the CI seven seven four
nine one who some of the reds are not
unsafe I don't know about that one no oh
that's the brown eyes shadow palette top
mica silica now same sodium or silica
this is all typical eyeshadow cornstarch
yeah these are all cornstarch is
actually used in in the Anasazi barrels
Modern Renaissance palette I believe but
the first time I saw that in there
yeah I'm gonna have to check out that
iron oxide red and the red red number
forty ultramarine blue is not lips safe
but yeah I mean not tested on animals
got the little cruelty-free bunny
24-month so I don't see anything that
looks questionable in there they're all
pretty typical all pretty typical so
okay wasn't in view oh it's gonna do
eyeliner and we're gonna do that with
the brow pencil brow brush fits in there
thank you some eyeliner with that Jess I
wants to know where they sell profusion
discount stores TJ Maxx Marshalls some
people said they see that their targets
I know the celibate target online pink
clouds thank you for the donation
you just bought two thirds of a pair of
shoes for a child that's so awesome I'm
gonna use this nightlife shade as my
eyeliner oh that is really I've dipped
into card that's my fault
because I I keep forgetting any stuff is
not it's pigmented
it's not won't help if you love our
shadows I'm not trying to offend you I
promise
that worked very nicely I like that they
do have profusion I noticed they do have
some stuff with bought seven dollars and
five dollars it's smaller products these
are the first ones I've tried those so I
can't tell you anything about the other
ones other things you see today that's
all I could talk about okay there we go
that worked out really well
hi Julie worked up very well
okay so either dawn if you might stare
it in a bit okay let's go into the wash
so this is the blush and bronze this
they sent me for the holiday collection
one says your eye shadows looking Bom
thank you so much I think so too I mean
fine Deborah says I've never seen
confusion to my target in the ether but
someone told me that thing hi we're
gonna use the blush out of this I
believe this is $10 as well let's go
ahead and use these shades are not
calling to me maybe we'll use bluem I
guess if I have to pick one
I wouldn't like like multi washes and
they're done
maldis stuff Oh Jim Sweeney thank you so
much that's so nice of you gents weenie
all right I need to be easy with this
because that is intense I'm just gonna
pop it like that cuz I'm scared of this
that's some fallout yeah I think that
was from the black nose from you're not
being careful I think it's important for
me to try to use betweens that came with
the products in case you don't want to
buy anything extra or if you're buying
this for someone that doesn't have a
wanna makeup tools I think that's very
soft and that blended very nicely
to do something about that black fallout
under my eyes though that's my fault
though I wouldn't bring the product and
I think I chopped up my destiny and
that's one out really nicely you
definitely go over the right-hand though
this is gonna last forever
it's been a little bit more on just
because I'm on camera and you'd be able
to see it like one sides definitely
darker than the other side John says I
have a lot of profusion there blush and
bronze as well as a contour palette are
great I have used this compass blush one
quite a few times this is what I can
tell you that I really like the last
encounter is good it's not great but
it's good we have a lot of mail coming
to the house today my husband my crazy
husband that you got to meet he brought
an adventure band
he bought a Sprinter van for our summer
road trip that we're planning we are
traveling for two months this summer I
need to talk to Todd about this
completely I need to talk oh my gosh I
just made it worse I just may have
fallen so much worse I need to talk to
Tabitha more about this but yeah we're
traveling now I'm like recognize hold on
what is happening I need something to
wipe off my face I know I have some my
silly water down here somewhere mister I
can just get it with my towel um but
yeah we're traveling for two months to
summer I'm gonna tell them exactly what
I'd want her to tell me because we were
really just planning this guest last
night and we were in lots of any
government I said but this summer we've
got in for two months and I'll talk to
you about like the plan for this summer
but there isn't going to be a lot of
content this summer
you're going to spend a lot of time in
the West face design should be a lot of
fun
Susan says again of your husband was so
adorable very nice to meet in here he is
very cute I have to say I like him a lot
I do alright we're gonna use the tante
work this I believe is five dollars oh
that's a fail the mirror fell out and
this is brand new I have opened this I
think twice
so that's not good try to press that
back in okay so I pressed it back and
now it's all my fingerprints all over it
but I pressed it back in let me see how
much the contour palette is search
contour hey the contour palettes there's
a couple of them on here this one is the
contour Pro makeup case it's seven
dollars it's got four reviews and
they're all four stars
what's the makeup should be live someone
said if they didn't see what's a good
makeup a cheeky live Oh Georgia Harris
this year hello my friends George and I
have been talking through that smells I
had a really strong chemical smell when
I first open that bad is not that is not
a good smell what's that ingredients on
this why the smell of this south mica
magnesium stearate mineral oil maybe
it's the mineral oil in it mineral oil
will make it a little more soft and a
little more soft yeah there's definitely
some different things in here and there
are parabens in this just so you know if
you don't like parabens
I don't mind clear bin for this carbons
in this a lot of them so the other ones
did not have parabens this one does now
as far as the contour shades I'm not
really happy as far as this game
universe to palette for lots of people
these shades the light medium and deep
contour shades I don't know if you can
tell that they really aren't that
different so Megan says what's in the
makeup isn't showing up in my
subscription list or when you go to your
channel that's really weird because I
did get some news on it it's very odd
well that makes me very upset what's
been makeup currently has 465 views
which is not a lot for what it normally
does oh it says its prime what it says
it's locked
hold on a second and now why is it
locked
it says locked what I met what is
happening here
it's so weird no what's happening sorry
guys I want people to be able to watch
what's up and make up it's so weird okay
it should be there now I had some
problems with uploading this one but it
has 471 views see if it's there now you
can check and see if it's there now okay
let me so anyway my point is is that
this is these are too close together if
I had a if I had to give them a 14 like
these are not far enough away for doing
different skin tones I mean I feel like
the deep on 23 much deeper than that I
had use the notification I couldn't find
any other way yeah it just showed up
okay the leg contours to like the medium
contour is probably pretty good the deep
contours to to like so that's my food
I'm gonna use the light contour because
often it let contour a little later than
I mean a little meat more medium than
the medium contour will use their brush
yeah that's not good that's not good at
all okay what's going to the medium
contour okay that's terrible
let's go into the deep contour it's very
powdery
maybe it's the brush okay the deep
contour it's working yeah this is not
going to be a recognizer it's super
calorie I don't like this one at least
from very very very first impressions
yeah y'all fix okay Tracy says it's all
fixed thank you for letting me know so I
could fix it
see that the deep contour is there okay
the deep contour is working I don't like
this brush I wish it was more like the
brush that is in the other palette this
brush is too floppy it's too thin and
too floppy and this is not blending very
nicely into the brush yeah this is this
this one's gonna be a no for me from
first impression I don't like the way it
applies I don't like the shades that are
in here as far as the contour shades
and I don't like the brush and it's
blending away as I blend it's blending
away which I don't like so that's gonna
be in so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
go ahead and go into this Oh Tabitha
says the lintel what to be makeup is on
what's up in makeup calm yes thank you
so much time I appreciate that I'm gonna
use this medium bronzer out of here
instead because I like this one better
and I like this blush better I don't
know it's kind of there no like I'm
messing my face not a fan of that I feel
like it's a nice brown had to be
something it had to be something that's
enough what's this one that one's a note
for me need to swatch the shimmer
highlight in here me use something else
this is the beige highlight so just
watch those real quick they're very
pretty
Melrose says Emily no I love the
diffusion highlight palette I have that
in there and I've really been enjoying
it I didn't bring that one out today oh
I want to some of the news for you
I didn't bring that one out today
because I have a different highlight
thing that they just said that I think
that they would want me to show you
they're falling within the pants I want
to show you some of these greens and
blues peaches my finger back in that
green of course these are just finger
swatches but I wanna show you what that
looks like
I saw someone something happened to
Reesa Reesa Reesa does makeup I believe
it's her channel I just started getting
to know her though that she seems very
very nice
yeah those seem they look really nice
they've got a nice light shimmer to them
they're not fully abled or anything that
they've got a nice shimmer to them very
nice okay so let's go ahead and go into
the highlight except this this is really
cool this is the way to bloke it
includes three highlighting powders one
liquid illuminated illuminator one taper
highlight brush and one small contour
brush so those are these here the
brushes are very nice except we got one
from the contour pit you seem really
nice they're very soft they feel great
oh we've got a little bit of
wibbly-wobbly here look at that I don't
know if you can see that but this Farrow
is going to pop off that is not very
well made this one it seems like it's
stained but this one is really really
wobbly no that's not good okay so let's
go into these powder highlighters which
one do I want to see okay well let's
watch them and see if anyone sees this
one is way too glow liquid illuminator
Oh George sham once enough Georgia heat
or immersion wants to know if I cut my
package Thank You Shay she's helping me
because I didn't see George's comment I
did not get it yet it was delivered to
my husband's hatching studio he's not
going in today I don't think like he got
it or else he would have brought it home
sometimes things you know don't end up
on his desk I'm saying
Cheyenne says Reese has been uploading I
haven't gotten any notifications that's
really pretty
so that's a contender that's really
pretty
I like that it's like a peachy Baird
shimmering that's very pretty
it's kind of thick though the N shame
you says wet and wild honey the best
drugstore highlighters Adrian says I
just found Reese's channel on watch your
stuff today she's very pretty
very good Sara says hey jam you need to
do a live stream with everything
skincare yeah how are they do that so
that's the thing is like I really have
trouble with skincare because you have
do you spin here for a long time in
order to seem like legit results okay so
I just opened this powdery everywhere
and it's the seal isn't even off yet
they will swatch it from the crumbs okay
so let's put it like right through that
is you know what these remind me of the
artist Fort Worth a meeting it will
remind me of the artist fort or ones air
processor notifications haven't been
working on YouTube these are glittery
got their that little teeny teeny teeny
glitters let's see if the other ones are
messy on the inside okay so that was a
whitish one and this one is more than
yellow toned RL since I would love to
see a room to a poor cruel it's not food
right now it's a mess you just can't see
it cuz I hide that from you I got a
messy room yeah it is kind of messy on
the inside on if you can see on the top
here their teeth and they're holding the
product close it make sure it doesn't
come out
look there's powder fanatic Bettina
oh my gosh
what a mess I think I mean I think just
shake it so I guess it's my fault but
I'm thinking like the pink that he put
it in your purse and then shakes it out
all day long
that was kind of what I find simulate
well I guess we're gonna have to get the
vacuum okay let's watch this next to it
these are very they're kind of sheer and
they're sparkly not glitter but like
very small gets kind of finding a little
john milk Jen look in your camera at
your reflection them there behind you
oh you mean like this but like anything
less and you guys see mess you see
that's my shoulder I'm looking to see
what you guys were seeing it's like a
magnifying that is so weird
it's like magnifying my my shoulder it's
gonna mean Julie lovely says
highlighters highlight my pores and
flaws I love makeup but it just looks
bad on me I think that why not happen I
always recommend doing one that is less
intense one recommendation would be the
one from essence the essence one is you
do it in bed if you want to mimic a
little more expensive then go in with
the hourglass one because they don't
seem to accentuate pores as much as some
of these other highlighters and with
these here I will not be shaving this
one this is the deeper one with these
fears these are sheer fish they're a
different kind of formula again they
remind me of the artist for poor ones so
if you like those you might like these
this one's a little messy inside kind of
like the last man I didn't shake this
one
I was trying to like think about if it
was in my bag you know I'll just kind of
give it a little bit of a roll if it's
in a drawer and it's kind of on
the run on this one but that would be
really pretty on medium to do purse
think that's too much that would be like
a nice eyeshadow topper but I wouldn't
use that on my cheeks karen says can you
show the other highlighter colors yeah
this one right here
maybe not sure which is the one that
Emma wants but this one here this one's
let me swatch this one for you these are
more opaque you'll see the difference
but they're very shiny so the ones on
the bottom so the three at the top are
the loose powder ones that I just swatch
for you and then the ones on the bottom
are the ones that are from the highlight
and contour palette which isn't really
contour how it's more about - Holly Jen
Oh tonight which says Jen I think
something might be messing up with your
mic the sound suddenly turned here and
foggy like someone suddenly put you on
speakerphone
oh no I hate it when I have a listen
mike has been like working and not
working oh you guys can't do a swatch
hopefully you can see it now move it
down a little bit is that better
okay it's it's 30 seconds of leg stop -
wait 30 seconds to see sounds static
he's still plugged in I'm sorry the
sound of static you know yeah I'm not
sure if I'm a fan of these powder ones
because they're really messy and then
they're not as okay because I personally
like so I think what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna use the liquid one today
if the liquid one seems very nice Jamie
has to go to work bye have fun at work
oh we only have 5 minutes left I saw
flip products to show you
Oh Laura Laura Alaura thank you so much
or before 5:00 a.m. so it's a big fan
but I have lots of excuse me she that is
sleepy okay so that looks really really
pretty that would be beautiful liquid
highlighter that's just as pretty as
some of my um liquid highlighters amber
says do you have a fan on you I do not
but my computer has a fan that
constantly is running so that might be
the computer fan that you're hearing I
do have a fan up here that's on the road
but it's not making any means I'm sorry
if the sound sounds bad I don't know
what else to do I have to figure out if
it's my microphone because I can't hear
the sound from your point of view I
can't hear it so I don't know what
you're hearing and I don't know how to
fix it I can look at my settings real
quick it says if the mic is working fine
like I'm looking at my settings so I
don't know I don't know what's happening
I'm sorry
allora really is a beautiful isn't it
ran along doesn't even by Wanda okay so
last thing is lips except the berry one
and I was thinking about using the
writer one so this is supposed to be
specifically for ombre lips I believe
they've got like a little the tutorial
on the back here I don't think I'm gonna
do all that today because it's very dark
and I'm just you know super dark lip
today um Risa Oh beautiful journey its
Risa are is a does makeup are is a okay
amber says it sounds like running water
I'm so sorry I don't even know what to
do it wasn't like that before and now it
is
alright let me swatch these for you so
let's start with a lip liner actually
let me see how much this is that's worse
I should say
then you do off-camera that you
shouldn't do on camera putting makeup in
there now all right let's look and see
how much this is the way it looks like
lips mix metals it is five dollars you
get all three products for five dollars
they have three different shades they
have a nude which is not my favorite
or at least it's different shades of you
there's a lighter and a more a medium
ish I don't like the need and then the
very one that I have and then there's a
Coco one so let's go ahead and swatch
those lip
it's a rollup lip liner oh that's very
clean nice when he says he pull the mic
closer to them now my shirt you always
keeping it real to somebody most says my
experience when a sensitive mic is
turned off to pick up someone quiet or
far away you get that static I'm gonna
have to check it out and see if I can
figure it out there's a person he it was
finally beginning and now it's not I
know in my last life students do not
sound great hopefully that's a little
bit better okay so this is these are
these are a little bit sheer these are
not only super opaque this is the metal
matte lip cream in the shade metal bar
mammy says nope it's still static not
the mic
Lindsley oh I love that name you said my
name's Mike thank you yeah I remember
saying it I thought that said it Oh
beautiful you is not feeling well I hope
you're feeling better soon this one is
called metal Barry okay this one's not
okay either they're kind of sheer that's
not necessarily a bad thing what he says
my voice is louder than the static I
haven't done anything Mike isn't even
coming through I'm gonna put this on my
lips as you know it goes it might be
just going to my computer Mike even
though my streaming software so did this
method
no sparkly at all these Georgian wants
to know is a private label brilliant I
have no idea
a lot of times brains don't advertise
okay this is very sheer it's a more wiki
kind of funny it's a flat but like it's
definitely very packed you go on well
once you smooth it looks please these
have to kind of smooth it it's not
sticky static is lessened with a headset
hey latina I don't know about a headset
for this what did I whisper I was just
whispering yeah yeah the mic is not
working the mic is not on but it says in
my in my software that the mic is
working so I don't know YouTube live
streaming is awful it's often you get a
little closer so you can see now I'm
just going to take this thing off Karen
it's the excusing my mic mic up here
which is not okay so it's drying down
it's not sticky not sticky at all yeah
you're just hearing the microphone from
my macbook it's getting dry it's
starting to not feel very good so it
definitely doesn't feel great my lips
are starting to feel like that
constructing I don't know we burnt off
food though like my my lip wrinkles are
starting to script over the product and
it doesn't feel good but Annie's got it
pretty actually nice of its history
first no it's not transferring let's do
another way
yeah he prettier on second here
but I only got to be able to race all
day well it's kind of uncomfortable
I've definitely deepened up on the
second layer you see that I think with
lipstick down who says is it half a new
lipstick I think it depends on your
level of tolerance of dryness if not the
worst I've ever felt I've definitely
felt worse and stickier and we're awful
but it's only not comfortable in any way
it feels dry like I can feel it but the
stickiness is the huge deal-breaker for
me it's not sticky at all but it is dry
it's dry and it is kiss free so it's
really what you what you like you know
and this is not a formula I would
personally recommend for my personal
tastes so the big wins today from first
confession are liquid highlighter I
really like this me powder highlighters
are know for me seller says drying
oh no I've super dry lips so I have to
avoid liquid lipsticks I thought was a
lip gloss how disappointing the economic
lip gloss is definitely worth the
lipstick the highlight and contour
palette I've used this multiple times
are going like this we blush and bronze
I've used this multiple times I really
like this the lip products are gonna be
a no for me personally the lip liner
might be good but the liquid lipsticks
are too dry it's very uncomfortable I'm
not enjoying that I'm definitely gonna
have to put over some kind of a bit
popular part of it be more comfortable
even though the even though the the
color is very very pretty and the kiss
purpose is really really pretty I don't
like the comfort level of it the
eyeshadow palette is a definite yes the
brow is a definite yes pretty huge so
kind of keep that in mind to cut the
storage space like this and the contour
palette was my least favorite thing this
is a definite no officially one hour and
four minutes so uh yeah and they can't
they can't I already kind of talked
about the brushes are right the brushes
are wonderful except for the one breast
that was in the contour kit this is the
only brush that I didn't like and it was
just the shape of it that I do like so
anyway I'm gonna go
ahead and pop off if you're thanking
everybody that donated again as soon as
I tell you everything up I will let me
know how much you all donated and then
once this video they tell me how much
money I pay off of it which will be in a
few days
then I will donate that money as well so
look for the official notice of how much
we're donating to we'll look for that
yes about maybe in four or five days is
when I'll be able to know the final
total it'll really just be like the
first couple of days of the live child
how much money I've made because I don't
want to carry it on forever like I want
the money to be donated and the most
money that I make is in that first 48
hours so whatever I'm making that first
48 hours that's the money I'll donate
because it's you know the pennies and
they got for that very you know that
will just go towards you 30% that I'm
covering from what you guys are donating
