what's of it makeup chat jammies Edition
I didn't change this actually
technically isn't jammies though but it
feels like pajamas so I wore to bed
because it's very very comfy it's Laura
Lee's new merch she's always been kind
to me so I wanted to support her by
buying one of those shirts and it is
very very comfy and I'm having coffee
because we had serious technical
difficulties with what's the makeup this
week and but that being said what is not
why we're here we are here because we
are gonna be talking about sephora's
bestsellers and whether there are any
drugstore dupes out there so that you
don't spend all that money at Sephora
and get drugstore stuff instead but I am
not the only one that's gonna be talking
about this we're also gonna be consulted
with the collective reign of quick of
Awesomeness also known as the people war
here in the live chat if you were not
hearing the live chat would you do this
at 10 a.m. Eastern Time on my youtube
channel so be subscribe so you get
notifications but pretty much every
Sunday and if you are not here you can
still be a part of the collective brain
of makeup awesomeness by commenting your
thoughts down below don't feel like you
need to wait to the end of the video to
leave your comment you can just leave
comments as you go and I just realized I
had spots all over my glasses and that's
not from flying man so what I did before
that this video was off my phone's gone
off this video was inspired by Tiffany
Dawn who just did a video on her channel
about the same topic where she talked
about support favorites and whether they
were worth it or not
Tiffany dawn is one of those channels
where like when I talked about youtubers
that I trust moments up people always
bring up Tiffany Jong she's very
knowledgeable and she's got a great
YouTube channels she definitely check
her out alright so let's go ahead and
before I actually before start I do need
to say hello to the collective brain of
makeup awesomeness I'm gonna go ahead
and just go over to the chat and look
and see who was here first
to pull all the way to the top and this
thing is the weirdest thing alright the
gold digger is here
hello and crowd killer trap Chen is in
Berlin Germany happy to have you here
Carlos here
Catherine downing is here check out her
YouTube channel banshee Lisa's here
Nikita and baby good morning and AJ is
here she's having breakfast on the
balcony once again with her beloved
butch partner Stacie she says hello to
everyone hello to a beloved butch
partner Stacie good to have you here as
well
Nadine is here reading mom is here that

name and I always promptly forget and I
apologize one day I'll get them all
Carla is here she's excited to hear
everyone's thoughts in these products
and Valerie is here the morning Valerie
amber and Carla says I don't believe
anyone talked about makeup I love this
chat me too and you know I have a couple
of friends that like nigga you know
people that I talk to occasionally but
my closest friends could care less or
couldn't care less the clip chair Laster
couldn't care less I think it's good if
they're like my best friend Mary Lynn
she doesn't care about the set doll
she's a big skincare junkie but she
doesn't um she doesn't do the makeup
thing her daughter does though her
daughter gets a lot of my decluttered
stuff when my reporters don't get it her
daughter got a lot of that stuff but she
doesn't care so I felt the same way
where I loved talking with you guys got
makeup cuz know who else wants to chat
about this stuff right except for us
junkies Karen is here and Sarah is here
beautiful good morning beautiful lovely
people of makeup madness Michele one of
our fabulous reporters is here good
morning Tony and Lizzie Karen and Gwen
and Gabriella and Jordan and arwen and
Cooney thank you so much for being here
if I didn't say hello to you good
morning to you as well happy to have you
here so let's go ahead and we are going
to go into Sephora's I have the app
loaded up but I found that the app
didn't have the same bestseller so what
you can do is you can you can go to
support as app or supports website I
like the website version and then go to
bestsellers so here is on the app but I
prefer on the website we feel like the
list is better and there's more
and all of that so I'm gonna be flipping
back and forth between the website and
here so the first thing that's on there
something that I actually haven't tried
yet oh the other thing I should mention
is that sephora's bestsellers change by
I notice weekly they kind of change its
supporters whole website kind of rolls
over weekly they add on Wednesdays all
of their new products and it seems like
everything updates at that point based
on what's currently selling so the first
thing is the Pat McGrath matte trans
lipstick and I do have one of those
thanks to my friend Nancy you don't know
either sugar mama she's my angel of
makeup her name is Nancy and she sends
me things occasionally and she's been
going little nuts lately so she sent me
this and I am so so thankful I didn't
open it yet because I was gonna open it
on Instagram it just seems such a shame
to open it by myself and then I just
never got around to putting it on
Instagram so we'll just open it right
now so this is the way that it comes and
I figured we would try it is there
anything else hiding in here I think
it's just the lipstick in there this
time who's usually Pat McGrath puts all
the stuff in these sequins and then I
can't find things let me put this over
here so it doesn't spill right there to
try to clean up and then it's just such
a such an interesting thing this
packaging that she comes up with it I
just don't I don't really get it okay so
this is the lipstick and Nancy got me
flesh three and it is really really
pretty
no sense at all and that is one gentle
swipe of it right there and we go back
to chat real quick to make sure I'm not
missing anything
Nancy's amazing she allows me to review
a lot of things that I wouldn't normally
review she's fabulous I don't know what
I did to deserve her but she's amazing
okay so what I'm going to do is I'm
gonna just apply it real quick you know
it's gonna look absolutely ridiculous
with no makeup on you get in here cuz I
want to see how it feels
there's so much stuff on this table here
so let us apply real quick
no pull at all
I can feel a little bit of texture and
then it doesn't feel like a buttery lip
balm they're easy to get me to keep its
though and I don't see it like
feathering immediately or anything but
that's how it looks it's time to dark of
course because I'm not wearing any other
makeup but what sweetheart I'm
enchanting yeah that's fine but I think
that looks really pretty of course this
is just first impression I wish I could
give you more than that but I thought it
was a shame to you know open it by
myself so I didn't do it yet but I
really like it I'm not gonna keep it on
though because it looks really weird
without any other makeup in my pijama is
to have this like Glam lipstick on but
it doesn't look completely matte it
looks like it's got a little bit of a
shine to it but it might just be my
light oh hi Nancy Nancy hi
try to get some on my teeth look there's
like no transfer on my teeth it's
transferring my hand but there's no
transfer my teeth that's super cool I
love that let's see how easy it is to
wipe off looks like it left a little lid
oh is staying behind but that I'm not
hating on that and it went off really
easily without making a big mess one I
like about it if it's not she so
supersoft that it um that it kind of
mushas everywhere you know what I mean
like it's got some substance to it so I
think I'm really going to like this is
it worth the price I don't know but do I
have any drugstore dupes for it not at
this moment but I will keep my eye out
for it and if I think of anything
I will definitely update you on that if
I can figure anything else out about
that Sheila wants to know his Pat
McGrath packaging recyclable if so she
maybe she's trying to be eco-friendly
oh you mean as far as like this stuff um
I don't know if it's recyclable or not
it's like oh it's it feels like a candy
so I don't know can you recycle candy
wrappers and things I don't know it's
just she's trying to be cute and
different that's my thought anyway Julie
says it looks good on you thank you so
much Brianna says Jen the lipstick is
supposed to roll up differently than
other lipsticks it is no I mean it just
rolls it spins as it rolls isn't that
what lipsticks usually do all see
anything Donna Angela says downgrade the
dang secret package again save us five
to ten dollars I don't think it costs
that much I think that it's just you
know when you have a luxe brand you're
gonna charge a luxe price and that's
just the way things conks you know
alright it's supposed to roll up
straight now it doesn't mine doesn't
mine spins oh wait no it's spinning it's
totally spinning alright let's move on
to the next product next one on here is
the Anasazi of Beverly Hills subculture
palette and I am working on a review of
this I do want to do the Kat Von D shade
in light glimmered palette first and
then this will be next I'm going to be
very late to the game on this because I
was born and Nancy actually caught this
for me - I know ready like I don't
people would be mad at Nancy forgetting
new things but um but yeah so she got
this for me while I was in Iceland I
wouldn't have gotten this while I was in
Iceland because I wasn't doing that
while I was in Iceland so I wouldn't
even gotten this at this point but I
just received it what two days ago two
days ago so I haven't even hardly played
with it hold the lips and spin someone
says hold the lips that's weird
look if you hold the lips it does roll
up straight that's weird
it's freaking me out
what's weird why'd she do that but would
it really so weird I guess because it
holds on to something I don't know how
that's I feel something clicking when I
do that I feel something click in the
bottom top here it says K says if you
twist the gold part is supposed to go
straight and then realm of darkness says
the holding is a gimmick all the other
all the other lipsticks do that too oh
okay that's good but anyway back to that
subculture i I've played with it I did
not wear it well no I wore this for
what's up and makeup as part of my look
I have found that I don't enjoy these
colors on their own it's too dark over
look for me if the way it's marketed is
their grungy and smoky and all of that
and it's too it's it's not my personal
preference as far as shades but that's
not their fault the powdery this is very
true but you tap very lightly into it
you can get it to work again full review
is going to be coming in like everybody
sing all lipsticks do that that's so
funny reading mom and Karen or else they
call ups all of them do that but yeah I
mean the color selection is just very
dark and it's just not my preference but
I feel like if I use this in conjunction
with other palettes I'm going to like it
more so I'm giving it a try I'm working
with it and we'll see you can see a ton
of reviews there's a lot of really good
ones while Beauty Christie is one that's
getting a lot of attention recently I've
been a huge fan of hers since with
fortunes in the knick great fortunes
minguk's face Awards I met her and I was
a bitch and I checked out her channel
and I found love and then if you want to
watch ones that are a little more
positive a little more you know with
Wayne Goss and Stephanie Nicole did
reviews that kind of teach you more
about how to work with it Samantha did
one Samantha Rob something starts to the
art that I can't pronounce
I don't want to butcher X she did one
where she did a few looks and talk about
how dirtiest of it so if you want if you
own this then those are some videos you
can check out to get some hints and tips
says you have them the Mario palette no
it is one of my biggest regrets is not
getting the Mario palette and they talk
about that limited-edition regret yeah
that's it that's my limit by big lemon
edition with that a BL says I like it
but not for $42 too much work yeah and
and Anasazi one thing I'm going to touch
on in the video is that the price
program on these is outrageous ah
Nastasia eyes shadows program is insane
it's like twice as much you don't get a
lot of product if it's gonna power
everywhere then that's even anymore so
those are initial first thoughts about
it but for you cutting let's go ahead
and go to the next product so laura
mercier translucent setting powder how
funny is it that I own like all of this
stuff okay so this actually got from
Influenster if you're not signed up for
Influenster anybody can sign up for it
how should i not sponsored I just you
know mention it because this product and
they send you free products the more
social influence you have the more often
they recommend things to you so the more
followers you have on different things
the more often they send you things but
even if you have like zero social media
following you can still get stuff sent
to you which is pretty cool so loose you
can they want you to like write reviews
on websites and things like that honest
reviews I am Telling You this is my
go-to setting powder this and the bare
minerals one on my go-to setting powders
I feel like this one is a little less
powdery then the than the bare minerals
one the bare minerals want I feel like
sometimes you I have to make sure that I
blend it out completely where this one I
don't have to worry quite as much it's
really really nice I don't have a
drugstore deep for this and of course I
don't have a drugstore dupe for the
subculture I've seen that NYX has an
eyeshadow palette it's someone with a
subculture but I don't own that so I
can't um I can't talk about that
unfortunately cherry says despite what
she said i think ii ii nicole was biased
and influenced by the PR it's not always
about the price the gesture can affect
too well this is what i have to say
about that i mean i feel like it's easy
to put that on people that they're gonna
be biased by things that are sent to
them but you you can't really know
what's in somebody's heart and based on
what I know about Stephanie
I don't see her ever being influenced by
something that sent to her because I
have seen her review things and be
brutally honest about stuff I mean she
is not one that gives a darn about what
other people think and say I mean I
she's not one that will mold her ideas
to anyone's expectation and I personally
don't feel that that's true but you can
choose to believe what you want to
believe but just because something set
doesn't mean that it's going to be a
biased review and you can know that from
my channel as well I mean I get things
sex me all the time and I will give you
an honest with you and then I go on you
know what I mean you'll see me make that
face but when I love something I'm gonna
say I love it you know what it was sent
to me or not it's one of those
double-edged swords you know you get
something sent to you and that well this
world
topic I could go on and on forever but
I'm just gonna I'm gonna let that go but
that's just the way that I personally
feel but you need to make the judgment
for yourself hug you
alright RCM a powder is one that people
keep talking about a lot in the comments
is anybody else have any dupes for this
that are CMA everybody say are CMA
Arsenio CMA and it's less it's much less
expensive people are saying art Wood
says I saw side-by-side swatch at the
subculture and I'm dodge me palate and
they're very similar
I feel like Jeffries colors are quite
different i they're similar but they are
quite different Jeffery has a strange
tone he puts in his in his eyeshadows
and Anna's lip products and everything
weird it's just a little off from the
norm which I definitely respect I
definitely respect his makeup creation
states then he really can put any twist
where I feel like this is definitely a
little bit more deep and dark where his
has just got a almost a soft edge to it
where this one's a little more crunchy
and down and dirt you know I mean but
I'm dead there's Stephanie similarity
here absolutely right let me see if I
missed anything saucer Jess says best
powder ever is the well people bio
brightening powder thank you so much for
that actually says I just bought the
mini Kat Von D stop it I'm gonna turn
off the sound I'm sorry
okay turn it off um I just bought the
mini Kat Von D setting powder from
Sephora and excited to try it nice okay
let me go ahead and scroll back down I
wanted to scroll up and make sure didn't
miss anything
Johnny says subculture palate isn't a
bad cop but it's nothing like the modern
Renaissance and that's what we all
expected yeah I mean it's definitely
nothing like the monomer I wouldn't say
that these are sister palates I would
say that they are you know fourth cousin
twice removed everything like that
they're not even close to related like
they're they're like from different
sides in the world like from the US and
from China like the complete opposite
like yin and yang you know glad you had
a great vacay oh thank you so much and I
know your name is I don't think your
name is Paul I think that your name is
your name really Paul or you have a
different name I think you might Sharon
counts I think that might be all right
so let's go ahead and move on Amy says I
want to try the Cote air spot I didn't
have good luck with that when I found it
to be very kinky on my skin but that's
just me I know I mean it's just
operator error it totally could be all
right next one is the Anasazi of brow
Wiz and these brow pencils are extremely
all across the board
drugstore high-end they are extremely
overpriced for what you get you get very
little product it's like thousands of
dollars per ounce of product because you
get such a small amount I mean this one
is point zero eight five grams it's like
nothing I mean it does take a while to
get through it I think they know that
and I think that's why they put so
little in there because they know it's
going they want it they want to last you
a good four to six months of daily use
so they only have to put in that much
but if you can avoid if you're trying to
save money don't buy this kind of bowl
of brow pencil buy a brow powder or by
an actual pencil not the roller kind
will get a lot more product but as far
as dupes for this the NYX one is really
really good the rep of its reference may
believe if the maybelline one is also
very very good if you go to a unique
party and you are done you know you just
want to buy something the brow pencil
from unique is actually
of pretty good but it's pretty much the
same price as the anastacio one so
you're not saving any money by buying
unique one but just know that it's
pretty good if you feel like you want to
buy something from unique uh-huh but
anyway so I mean it's good it's
definitely good but I don't feel like
unify the anasazi abroad with I don't
see any difference between that one and
the next one go back over to chat Jenny
says L'Oreal's or fav oh the Loreal
maybe it wasn't Maybelline I don't think
it is me when I think it is the l'oreal
one i think you're right it's been a
while since i did the comparison i think
it's been a year since i did the
comparison between those i forgot what
the drugstore brand was thank you so
much for saying with l'oreal it is the
l'oreal one not he may believe but
Loreal brow stylist yes thank you guys
so much for fixing that for me because
you know right what would I do that you
I'd be giving out wrong information but
the next one is also very very good
j9 says stop up during almost 20 days of
beauty or support the ID so that is very
true but I honestly don't feel like this
is necessary at all
like at all Paul says just the gay guy
I'm a drag queen oh good okay well I
just want to make sure I'm calling you
correctly so Paul yes so happy to have
you here Paul I hope you didn't find
that to be disrespectful but there's
there's someone here that it's a man's
name but they're using their husband's
account and I always I get that confused
so I'm very happy that you're here and
now I know that you really are called
Jennifer says love the NYX brow brow
pencil the most very good and Loreal
brow pencil needs and more colors
Jasmine says absolutely right and that's
one edge the honest Tavia has is that
the core range is amazing it's really
good they've got nice ones for like
redheads and blondes and stuff that I
don't feel like the other the drugstore
brands have Julie says I love love love
the basic elf eyebrow pencil in taupe I
did a little elf poll last night after I
was when I was anything for the show I
jumped on elfs website and I bought
bought a bunch of stuff because I feel
like I really want to do more drugstore
stuff the problem is is a lot of the
drugstore stuff that I buy it's just not
good and I really want to bring you I
don't want any drugstore hater just all
I really want to bring you like really
good drugstore stuff like this video you
know I just I feel like you
the stuff it's not as good and just over
and over and over again not as good not
as good just okay just average it just I
don't know for me that's boring I wanted
to do exciting really good things so I'm
hoping this alcohol is gonna be awesome
all right Naza says I've used the Mack
brow pencil fabulous okay let's move on
next one is the Amistad they're
modernist awesome too kind of touched on
that Anasazi Modern Renaissance is a
classic palette it's one of those that
there's there are people that don't like
it but Oh everybody's talking about my
Laura Lee shirt thank you so much I did
purchase this myself in support of Laura
because I adore her as a person she's
always been very very kind to me she I
was talking about this in my getting
ready with me that she has been so kind
to me
tinier than anybody else that I've ever
met at that that's at that level usually
people that are at that level really
don't want to talk to me beyond like hi
nice to meet you good bye when Laura has
actually tried to she's taking it
further than that and trying to be
friends with me which I thought very
admirable because a lot of people get
too big for their britches and I don't
feel like she is so that um that really
means a lot to me so I really wanted to
support her but anyway so this is the
model and it sounds perfect I really
like this a lot I don't reach for all
the time as you can see it's not super
well loved but that's just because of
the color selection in it I just don't
use the one tones as much as I think
some people do
I mostly find myself reaching for this
in order to just grab one color like to
grab Primavera or the bad Cypress umber
or you know do cardio Barre something
like that work I know there's a shade in
here that I'm gonna lose but as far as
using this for a complete look I don't
find myself reaching for it as much but
it's a fantastic quality products very
easy to use it's very beginner friend
yeah for example with the subculture
that I'm getting my hair subculture
review right now not because I have
tried it enough but as far as the
subculture like I would never ever ever
ever in millionaires recommend Esther
degenerate because some of these colors
if you put them together they look
absolutely atrocious together they look
so bad if you think you can put together
a lot of these things but no it's
looks really valid I tried and it was
just move it was terrible so but this
one I feel like you can put any
selection of any of these colors
together and still better than for me
work and I really am excited about that
about the monumental thoughts versus the
subculture working like this you really
have to have a knowledge of colors in
order to know how to put these colors
together because the way that I like
talk to people about putting I shut us
together as you go if you want to do
like a business o'clock light middle and
deep on the outside and then like a
little bit like a mutual mat you know a
little darker than your skin tone up in
the crease and then we were done but
this it's so full of the same kind of
tone but the colors are so different
that you can use a lot of these colors
together even though they're all like
made too dark kind of shades so it's
really confusing on how this thing it's
it's really confusing how to get this
thing to work with this one it's super
super easy I don't have any drugstore
duty for the mana gonna sauce but if I
ever did not I wouldn't be surprised if
makeup revolutions working on them no um
no Felicia something's going on Felicia
my friend Felicia what's going on Miss
Georgia horrible had hail trees down and
a team died near my house oh my gosh for
the show I was wondering why you weren't
in shadow I was talking about you in
chat line weren't there we had a big
huge storm in Maryland and Tabitha's
colonies out so that was big you know
craziness as far as getting the script
to me but it's how I got the shoot if
you don't know she the one that writes
my script from you for what's been
makeup and we had a big craziness trying
to get that but anyway it was just a
bunch of storms on Friday night Jenny
says wait for the genocide law says
Stephanie called Nicole brought up the
color wheel and how you have to watch
how they plant absolutely absolutely
totally agree about that it's very
complicated to use Steph says I still
feel the subcultures that make a
complete look I look I really can if
you're super skilled I'm just not that
still not notices Jen busier dark matte
for is they're good alternatives for
subculture that's great that's thank you
for that suggestion I don't know off the
top of my head what that looks like but
I'll definitely have to check that out
alright let's go ahead and move on to
the next thing it's already 10:30
you've only done five products he's not
good okay the next one is the Burberry
beauty box and I didn't get this
particular beauty box but I got one a
long time ago and I would say that the
Burberry beauty box selling at $35 it is
a sample trying Burberry thing just to
get the bronzer I feel like it might be
worth it to you now this one is in
number 7 they're selling number 11 in
this one 11 is a little bit darker than
this this one kind of matches my skin
tone right now it's kind of hard to see
but when I'm Taylor it is a perfect
natural contour it smells amazing it
smells like Burberry could feel it
smells so good it smells really really
good and I just really love this powder
I don't know why I don't reach for it
more often but if you ever wanted to try
Burberry stop this would be a great way
to try it for the $35 because you're
getting $35 for the product just in this
and then the lipstick I liked it was a
red lipstick I don't remember getting a
mascara I did not like the liquid glow
because it's like glitter like I would
use it more as a highlighter than a
primer I think that it's a Betty because
I know I got a primer with it let me
just double check and make sure I'm
talking about the same thing because my
box was quite a while ago fresh glow in
nude radiance that might be a
highlighter now that I'm thinking about
it but I had gotten one and had a primer
in it it was full of glitter and it was
terrible pancham you says I bought the
same Burberry box and I love the earthy
blush yeah if you if you're my skin tone
if you're deeper then you might not get
any use out of it but you'll have to
look at swatches of number 11 and see if
you can find swatches on your skin tone
to see if it'll work for you but as far
as formula goes it's very very soft very
very long bearing and it's very neutral
tone which is another thing that I
really really like so for me that's
something that I really want but you'll
have to look and see whether you can use
the bronzer and if you can then I would
I would recommend checking it out
alright next up we have oh I don't have
a dupe for that either let's see well
for those who have the Mario propound
it's like owning subculture I I've seen
Mario Pro palette it seems to be quite
different shades it seems to be a look
at but it might be a little bit more
workable in subculture but that's just
from
observation I don't know man okay next
up they have the Matt trance trio and
then cap on the everlasting like they
look six I really want to get to some of
this other stuff Kat Von D liquid
lipsticks the way I feel about these I
feel like it to me they're too dry
I personally am NOT a fan of these I
feel like that they don't flake as bad
as the Augusta's 'ya ones but they're
they're pretty drying for me and I don't
really enjoy this formula I tried using
like renewed lip gloss over top to kind
of make them a little more comfortable
and it ends up making them messy and I'm
just not a big fan of this formula
that's just me personally I don't know
if anybody has any drugstore for these
but if even if there was a drugstore for
them I probably wouldn't buy them
because I'm not a huge fan of this
formula it's not terrible I just feel
like I have to keep an eye on it all day
long to make sure it doesn't look like
to do it's just that's why I gave to
Karen says Kat Von D formula seems to
improve Oh when says they don't last on
me and they dry at all or dry down Sammy
says I'm all I am over liquid lipsticks
I wish the trend would change there you
go
is it transfer proof I don't think
completely I think it's close but I
don't think it's completely vanishing
these Kat Von D's too drying but
beautiful
Karen says I've got the chimp one and
not drying it all love it Oh fantastic
Leisha can't wear the formula Lisa says
my opinions on lip since I haven't tried
it I've seen enough bad stuff then I'm
not sure if I want to try it
Billy says wet and wild cats you I've
heard great things about those Saucer
Jess says the wet and wild cat suits are
similar to the Kat Von D's Dan texture
that's great to know so if you're
watching this and you want to try
something similar the wet and wild cats
it's like four wonderful things about
those
Daniel says hi Daniel
cat Monsey and echo is the Patras
lipstick I've ever seen
oh my goodness no it's terrible
Nadine says bring on the cream lipsticks
and the tinted bombs on that black
diamonds and pearls do you like the dose
of colors with the lipstick yes I love
the dose of colors liquid lipsticks they
are super fab and doze of colors we
posted me on instagram agree posted the
makeup minute a few days ago and I like
who literally stood up and what and
didn't dance around my house and I was
very very excited because the Polish is
one of my favorite brands so oh wait no
it wasn't those colors oh my gosh I'm
such an idiot
only the ones dose of colors right now
that I'm thinking about this is why life
is not good it wasn't dose of colors it
was code rain it was clear eight I love
dose of colors I love color grain and I
love Julius place those are my three
favorites and sometimes I got that
perfect it was color gradient reposting
me not there suppose I had to correct it
though because then if you look like
those cars website be like Jenni lag
wasn't so I'm off talking okay moving on
welcome to the live stream it was
coloring yeah have this like alright um
I got it I got it I got it
karen says bow and arrow and lovely look
the bolita are good I thought one leave
it to that one was okay
Paul's laughing I mean totally fine Tim
he says good morning traveling this
morning just want to say hi thank you to
me for the idea for this video I really
appreciate it alright let's go ahead and
move on to tip me I'll give you a shout
out earlier so hopefully people come
check out your YouTube channel
so for favorites give me some nude lip
there is a new one just came out it just
came out maybe I think it's beginning of
July it must have been when I was
traveling because you didn't mention it
on the show
I do like they give me some new lip sex
personally looking at the selection I
like the one that I bought it's a little
further down the one that's not new I
like the selection and that one better
look by the choice between the two I
would choose the other one because it's
got a lot of good stuff let me go down
and tell you what's in it so you know
which one to look for the I really liked
the the urban decay
vice waterproof lipstick in trivial I
really like that I've heard terrible
things about this liquid lipsticks but I
really like that one definitely not
transfer proof anyway but I loved the
way it looked
it comes with the toothpaste lip
injection glossing Spice Girl which I
like the Tarte lip lingerie tint in
revealed which is a light mocha I like
that as well the NARS Velvet lip lied
and found I really like that the Marc
Jacobs
enamour'd high shine lip lacquer and
sugar sugar I like that as well and then
the anastacio lip gloss and um Kristin I
like that one too I mean it was for $28
it is totally totally worth it support
favorites kits are definitely keep your
eye out for those when it starts getting
closer to the holiday season because
they come out with some really good ones
then one thing that's on here that I
don't own that I want to get the
community's opinion on is the NARS
creamy concealer I have never tried it
so I have no idea anything about it
except for what people are saying about
it and people will either love it or
hate it and I would love you know the
communities I idea on that amanda says
she loves that set it's amazing hi
Jenny says that's cute shirt where did
you find it mrs. laura lee's merch and i
already went into earlier people that
are watching some weeks they're gonna
get annoyed for me but annoyed with me
but this is from from laurel leaf it's
her merch that I bought why need eight
hour lipstick Paula says I think people
like an eight hour lipstick because they
go if they go to work and they don't
want to have to reapply
I guess now going on to about the
concealer Briana oh wait one more thing
with the lipstick Briana says I really
didn't like Urban Decay's liquid
lipstick looks super dry and wears
really weird I wish we didn't put as
many lip glosses in that set I totally
see that perspective personally that one
worked great for me maybe just that one
that was good maybe there's a difference
in formulas but I liked it but I know
I'm in the minority I didn't hear any
good reviews of those like what six but
I really liked
okay now going on to the concealer now
that everybody's kind of caught up with
me it's skipped up okay
Oh Amy says I've heard mixed reviews I
use very little concealer Sammy says
I've had this is about the the NARS the
creamy radiant get the name light NARS
radiant creamy concealer Amy says I've
heard mixed reviews on use little
concealer Sammy says I have dry skin and
I love it
Jane says it's fine Arwen says NARS
doesn't make a light enough color for me
to highlight with BAM says I love it Kat
says only like the creamy matte in the
pot okay great to know Maddie says NARS
is above my pay grade
that's why I haven't bought it beautiful
journey says Jen I love the NARS creamy
concealer Brianna can't wait for the
support favorites for the holidays Julie
says NARS is just too pricey for me I
own them and look at that line yeah it's
kind of crazy reading mom says I'm old
53 that is not old the NARS is Chrissy
and dry on me goddess 131 I think a lot
of people have dropped in our since
they're not 44 anymore I think that did
happen you don't hear about NARS nearly
as much I don't know if it's because of
the cruelty free thing or not but you'll
hear about NARS nearly as much as you
get a couple years ago say anything else
Elle Elle says the NARS and the pot is
fab covers my uber dark circles the
chewed one is a solid pass so there we
go so we've got some really great
opinions on that I wish I could give you
my personal opinion but Rihanna says I
love the wet-and-wild concealer but they
need to make a lighter shade everybody
needs to make lighter shades and V gases
in our suits Hillier didn't work
Stevie's girl says everyone is loving of
C B's girl on calling that leo says
orally Lee says everyone is loving the
color clock concealer s foundation
that's interesting and it seemed reviews
on that yet I know they're out there
though okay moving on Kat Von D tattoo
liner have Von D tattoo liner
okay I don't have one of those currently
but I have a deep for you and where did
it go where's my dude go oh where oh
where has my little dude gone oh my gosh
guys oh my gosh okay I'm not even
kidding I am not exaggerating
Monte's has gone
Schubert's Stila stay all day liquid
liner pull the Grails for a lot of
people this right here is the best dude
I have ever tried Jessie's Girl liquid
liner husband a favorite of mine for a
very long time it's like eight bucks
I usually ordered them off Jessie scroll
website you can get them at Walgreens I
believe still sells them but they don't
sell them at my Walker you have to order
more money this is so much more
accessible and it's just as good if not
better this is the NYX epic ink liner
holy moly okay Nick sent me a big box of
stuff and I'm trying things or trying
things and most of the things you're
probably not gonna hear about because
they're just average okay
kinds of things this is one talking
about as far as when things are sent you
there's a lot of things that were just
okay for me but this one this is the gym
this is the thing this is amazing okay
the point is exactly the same as the Kat
Von D one it isn't exactly the same the
bends on it is perfect the amount of
liquid that comes out is perfect now I
haven't had it for a super long time so
I don't know about when it's going to
dry out whether it'll dry out for the
three month mark that is going to be the
big test in this because the Kat Von D
and the stealer do not dry out on me
the Jesse's girl colored ones dried out
on me and got really patching but the
platform is good so I'm still testing
this to make sure there isn't some kind
of epic fail as I use it more but as of
now this is new holy girl status this
UNIX epoch tank liner and just abroad
from Geoff VG e.9 talked about this in a
recent video as well
she said pretty much the same thing it
is thinking amazing yes
yes on that one so please do yourself a
favor if you're looking for a good
liquid eyeliner and go out and try this
one I have I'm not being paid for this
video just to make sure this there Nick
sent me a box of goodies but they are
not paying me and he just said you know
here's some stuff it needs to mean them
okay look what you're gonna do
oh yeah there's a bunch of mediocre
stuff and then there's this amazing and
there's some good stuff there's some
good stuff but I haven't dug a whole lot
into it yet I'll let you know if I find
anything else it's on me
all right let's look back at the live
chat and see if anybody else is talking
about anything Katie says I love
Jessie's Girl I have to go back to
California from Arizona or my family
lives to get it from ready to stock up
oh it's ready not Walmart Thanks our
Walgreens thank you so much I always
forget which one Nana says essence liner
waterproof is a dupe - I did not
you know what the essence liner
waterproof is good I don't find to be as
good for me personally but if it's go
the Physicians Formula liner lasts
really long time for with El Pitman like
eight months plus I use it everyday
that's another one that I don't like as
much I don't like the felt tip as much
as I like the brush tip the brush tip
for me is more accurate so I personally
don't care for the physician's formula
as much as the Jesse's girl and those
because it's a personal preference then
but I know there are a lot of people
that really like the physician's formula
that is definitely not one of my
favorites and I totally respect
everybody that loves it but it is not
one that I enjoy as much now Dan says I
love the Kat Von D liner the only one I
love trooper yes and I tried some of the
other colors I tried the the two-faced
ones with the colors I was not impressed
at all
they were pens and they were cute and I
bought two of them new terrible they
were dodgy and they didn't show up
partly I bought the violet one I don't
know why I bought the light purple one
and the blue one and the peach one I
bought three like the light purple the
light blue and the peach and none of
them showed up like okay buy those
expecting to look like paint like they
don't just watching look we're not good
sherry says Essex has a good as you for
the Stila just to mention that one as
well I don't think I've tried in essence
liquid liner they try the essence I
tried a lot of sub-concussive I don't
think I've tried that one I have to keep
my eye out for that thank you so much
that sherry I appreciate it alright
would says I know it's crazy expensive
but the tomboy liquid liner is my Holy
Grail but some people are in that price
range some people that's what they buy
so it's good to know that - jessica says
Kat Von D trooper was not good for me
the colour was barely even applying to
my lids could not get a solid black line
from it
you'll never get a good line not too
much away with it really I am so
surprised
Wow maybe you've got a gun could you get
it done nothing terrible shame you know
what and it might be like the level of
wheel that people have on their lids to
that some things may work better than
others because I that's a huge factor in
your production or your level of dryness
on your eyes Sarah says he had Jesse
Charlie sword at Rite Aid which is
almost EBS so it really so I really wish
CVS for bringing the line we did it
we want a minute I thought Walgreens
bought writing no no I don't often look
that one up I thought well green spot
ready but I think they only bought a
part of it at this point not the whole
thing but anyway point is somebody
bought somebody any wish there was not
some real do I just wish they would sell
more Jesse's gross stuff some Jesse's
girl stuff is not good though like the
eyeshadow with not a shadow sadly Ezra
says I finally went on vacation and went
to Rite Aid and got one of each of
Jesse's girls liners one is a felt tip
and one is a brush the brush mom was way
better yeah the brush was paper totally
the color ones don't bother
alright let's move on to the next one
because we only have 15 minutes left I
can't believe it this is going by so
fast okay Too Faced natural love palette
is on there this palette okay I know to
face gets a lot of heat for their
eyeshadow formulas rightly so rightly so
I feel like a lot of their eyeshadow
formula it can be patchy too boring
all of that and I feel like this one is
one that I actually really liked and I
do have a full review on this somewhere
on the channel but I actually really
like this one but only for certain
people if you like a really super copy
punchy with glittery instagrammy kind of
look you'll probably find this to be
extremely boring but if you're just
looking for a palette for like everyday
we're going to work one to school kind
of thing I definitely actually recommend
this because you can get a ton of
different looks out of this I love the
way that it's organized it's another one
of those conflict the modern Renaissance
where you can pull from anywhere and get
a good look you don't have to worry
about pulling something and put it
together and being like well that looks
like doodoo except for maybe you know
I would imagine I haven't tried this yet
but like hot and bothered and bunny nose
might look a little weird but I mean I
don't know I feel like this one is if
you stick with the cools together
I don't know but sometimes you can get a
nice contrast with a warm in a cool
color but I really like this and I know
to face of gang a lot of hate lately and
I I totally get it but I'm not gonna lie
about how I feel about something just
because the trend right now is to hate
on to face I'm not going to not just
because I really like it I do I do
really like it but again if you like
really poppy punchy but you probably the
fine is quite boring but it's nice and
stable palette it's a nice gift to like
this would be something that I would be
totally awesome buying for my mother
like my mother would do so well with
this or you know for a teenager wouldn't
this would be great for so Vanessa does
makeup and shows a great shadow I
totally agree totally agree that was one
that was a minute for tutorials how it's
dark dark dark brown it's a really nice
show you definitely are with this tea
tattoo face PR packages are on point oh
I know right they said not the roller
skates and everything I was like oh Lord
I think your panties are out of control
though like the things they sound like
you notice like I don't think that they
used to send that elaborate packages
until the key our unboxing started and
now they're like ooh they're crazy
Mimi says poppy and punchy is my
everyday wear to work look and you know
what some job you can get away with
doing that but a lot of jobs prefer you
to wear a more conservative makeup so
that's why I'm going for that I'm not
trying to say anything negative to
anybody that wears copy and pleasure to
work and I'm hoping that you know that I
don't mean it in a negative way Julie
says I wish to face cared about the
formula I think about the packaging yeah
totally here yeah I totally very on
kamsa start set people are doing but I
saw that how weird is that Tina says
that the Laura Lee shirt yes it is it is
I were to bed because it's so super
coffee I don't even know if I'm gonna
wear this isn't everyday shirt because
it's just too comfy you think it's it
feels like pajamas it's so comfortable I
don't know I might be over wearing
everyday sure if it's seriously building
together alright moving on without a lot
of good stuff
got 10 minutes left so next to the Too
Faced better than sex mascara more Alda
nice job with this one voluminous /
paradise
I didn't better than sex is one of those
mascaras you either love it or you hate
it I think it's the same thing with the
oneness / paradise but if you did like
me better than sex I definitely
recommend trying the voluminous lash
arid ice I do wish more of these drugs
to our companies were Polti free I got
my 43 friends you're gonna freak out
about this you know why can't be cruelty
free I do wish that they were I can see
us going in that direction just because
I feel like there are more and more
brands going full to pretty much more
and more demand for cruelty free so I'm
really hoping that soon they go cruelty
free but if you are open to buying this
and you did like the two pace cars in
sex I would definitely recommend trying
this one out I found this one to be less
clumpy and less heavy than the the
better than sex Amy says I think it's
better than better than sex I think
better than sex is okay don't hate but
it's not my favorite Haley says I hate
it I'm not sure which one you're talking
about maybe better than sex Julie says
better than sex flakes on you yeah it
didn't flake on me
ooop says I don't like better than sex
but the waterproof version is amazing
which I have not tried but Vaughn says
lash paradise smudges when I wear a my
lower lashes but otherwise I do like it
I need you use mascara on my lower
lashes so I can't speak to that but I'm
Maria I'm area Laura says wearing out
laughs paradise is so much better
malroux says cruelty-free thumbs up
thumbs up yes I agree
Mimi hates better than sex and Laney
says not a fan of that either really
love this feel a huge so much more the
skill if you just fabulous that's a
really good mascara but I still feel
like even at the scale of huge I like my
house and semester is just as much a my
Jordana best lash extreme I don't know
see what you just pretty good though
it's it that's a really good one
[Laughter]
alright I'm gonna go ahead and go to the
next item because we're running out of
time it cosmetics you're seeing a better
CC so this is the cosmetics CC cream I
have two of them this one in medium is
too dark for me the light one is a
little too light for me so I tend to mix
them this is really good
how do you really like this I have no
problems with it my only problem with it
ever was that I didn't have a good shoe
that matched me but I do really like
this the lasting power is really good
it's a nice to light to medium coverage
which is what I like for day-to-day and
I enjoy the texture I enjoy the way that
it feels on my skin and I have no
complaints about this it's amazing
as far as drugs for dupes I would say
the closest structural groups that I
have for this would be be pure minerals
one that I think might have just come
out actually that's not drugstore mine
that's Barnier the Garnier BB cream is
really good I've gotten in a really long
time but that one is fabulous I
definitely recommend that one Ashley
says the egg cosmetics CC cream oxidized
on the acai face Friday face
I'm so sorry Sammy said the CCP makes me
sad because it isn't light enough yeah
they just definitely just need to extend
the shade selection oh my goodness lots
of opinions okay so let's see else says
I got a sample and it looked amazing
however it did Rasch me and I'm not
sensitive
oh no person says love to CC cream for
no makeup makeup days just loves it
maybe even hates it she said it's Greece
city in two hours for her oh my gosh
it's so funny because we got Jess it
says she loves it and I'm right under
her as Nadine says that she hates it
because it's greasy on her it's just you
know it's one of those things where I
think foundation is so formation because
history is soap
you know and you really just have to try
try it and see and I think doing a
drugstore option is so much more logical
if you've done because this is a lot of
money I don't know don't use this stuff
it's less expensive
it's a $38 I mean that's been high so if
you can get the Garn hey I definitely
recommend trying that one our village
says if cosmetics needs more shades
Tiffany says I really like it CC cream
Briana says it doesn't set on me and
feels tacky all day really Wow
interesting
jordan says she loves the NYX any cream
interesting just as the Bondi Beach
Queens a dead-on jeab
I feel like it too at least from what I
remember he's been a while since I've
used it so I ran out
hey Nicole is here from the internet'
Nicole she says I'm lucky it's easy but
it makes me too shiny so I've to be
careful when I applied don't use it a
lot to do that so it sounds like the
people that tend to get shiny faces
don't like it but if you have drier skin
maybe it will work when the kauai number
you have an oily skin that's very
interesting
gentlemen if anyone says hi hi Jen Mel
says I love love love that CC cream I
don't need any other foundation ever I
try to mix it with the illumination one
nice Lisa says I love it it's a fade
right for melasma fabulous you don't
know melasma is a just discoloration of
the skin so that's fantastic
Jenny says she has to set it she has to
set it shel says that the roller lash is
her favorite I didn't really care for
that one personally I didn't work for me
but again it's one of those things
that's very very personal the only
lasted what was redundant my brother
very lush I was heavy
it felt really heavy and then like they
expect and I can't remember I don't want
to say wrong
who's feeling wireless Benny man I
Sydney said the cover girl came at know
clean is so good and away the deep core
it thank you so much for that said we
have appreciated it Victoria says really
lash is the best so I mean it's
different different
it's totally okay heads up their
opinions sounds like my husband and my
daughter are back from yoga so we must
be getting close to 11 o'clock all right
let's go ahead and go on to the next
thing because I'm working to show you so
born the to a foundation from Too Faced
I have two of these I've got these as
Point perks from Ipsy a vanilla and
light beige and I tend to reach for like
they use the Sun here and then vanilla
the rest of the year I like this a lot
but it is quite full coverage for me I
don't feel like it makes you look like
they're born this way I think it makes
you look like you have foundation on
that's more for coverage and that's okay
but I do like it I do like it a lot
lasting hard for me is really good I am
testing today after I get off of here
I'm testing this for my series but okay
if you don't watch what to pay I'm gonna
be testing this this is supposed to be a
dupe for the toothpaste so I'm gonna do
the toothpaste on one side and this on
the other side of my face and test the
bear time of it I wish I could tell you
the name of the brand but it's written
in Korean on my tube and I don't know
the name of the brand I will put it in
the description of the video as soon as
I find out what it's called but this is
a full cover it says BB cream that says
whitening and anti-wrinkle which I'm
gonna have to see how much with
whitening is in here because they
definitely don't like me brightly
whitening products for me it's not my
favorite ingredient I understand that
it's kinky and that's something that
they love in their beauty products but
it's not something I've pushed my way so
some of these have more what new
products and others so we're gonna get
into that and what the K but I didn't
want to show this to you because I am
testing this today for tomorrow's and
videos this should be good money I've
usually twice so I have some first
impressions and then the review video
for their test will be up tomorrow I'm
hoping I'm probably later in the day
tomorrow because it's gonna take me a
while to test it today and film today
and I gotta clean my house today that's
gotta happen because you only have two
minutes left I do want to do one more
product what am I going to choose what
do I have left
okay okay so we'll do this one well gosh
there's a couple things I wanted to talk
about okay so let me let me just go
really quickly so the anasazi a dip brow
is a product that I
have a love-hate relationship with
because it can be really really dark and
really thick and I'll certainly prefer
that look on these like to be really
careful not to make it like super dark
and thick this is an indie brand that I
was introduced to at IMATS they were
kind enough to give this to me I got to
tell mr. d'Oro
the color isn't as dark they don't have
as many shapes elections but this is
like really really cheap I want to say
it was like 10 or 15 dollars and you get
a brush with it and I mean you can see
the color difference there there is a
difference this is chocolate and then
this is their unibrow oh it says buta
brow gel what's the color brown color
just brown but this is really
inexpensive and the formula is very
similar so if you're looking for a black
expensive dude I would recommend them
this adoro
one and it's very inexpensive I was
shocked when I saw how inexpensive it
was but everyone get like a whole little
kit for like 10 or 15 bucks all right
and then the last thing I wanted to talk
about okay here we go
benefit gimme brow we're gonna lock the
brow through that woof the ground all I
want to talk about these feels - okay
benefit gimme brow so used to look like
this and then I lost the one here it is
so now it looks like this and used to
look like this and it's the same formula
so if you tried here what it look like
this it looks exactly its exact same
thing I do like this as a product but I
would not recommend buying this I would
recommend getting the beating essence
one the essence one is just as good I do
not recommend getting a Maybelline brow
drama because the wand is ridiculous
unless your brows are ginormous need
large this is it's gonna get it gets all
over the place it looks horrible so yeah
I don't recommend this one because the
wand is terrible but definitely the
essence one is very very good I'm just
gonna zip through these as fast as I can
for the drugstore groups so it is a
great product but I really feel like the
essence and stuff is good I think that's
it that like nine times
alright steal off the don't get too
excited I don't have any exactly please
but this seola magnificent metals these
things are
then they did you transfer some they
give the most beautiful glittery glow on
the lives of everyday life
what I would recommend if you want
something similar it is more finely
milled if you can on the LA Colors
shimmer in loose eyeshadow these are I
got this at the dollar store and these
are amazing they're so so good they give
you that nice bright bold look lasting
power is really really good
don't use a brush that's in here they'll
use the brush and he's like you're going
to make a brush don't use a brush or cuz
it gets a big mess but wait to see the
pigmentation on this it's crazy
on I'm using brushes for a second just
to show you oh my goodness and it's a
loose powder so it's kind of falling all
over the place but these things are so
amazing this is it blended out but
especially like if you really want it to
pop that serious punch you can always
wet the brush you can use um you can use
some glitter glue if you want to make it
super poppy but like on the lid I cannot
even read with your fingertip or if you
want to get a lighter with a brush these
things are amazing you definitely
recommend those you're looking for that
bright bold Lib with ease try those
dollar store girlfriend or boyfriend
dollar strip the last one that I want to
talk about last one I think it's the
last one is the Smashbox photo filter
over the place of all Smashbox no honor
where is it smudge
Oh where'd you go Smashbox iconic photo
finish foundation primer the dupe that I
have for that is actually by Coastal
Scents it's the beginning the space
primer it feels and works exactly the
same as the Smashbox one eight got that
silicone slip to it so if you like the
Smashbox mine I definitely recommend
trying this one out I think it's like 10
or 15 dollars something like that versus
the Smashbox which is 36 so if you're or
if you're ordering from Coastal Scents
definitely recommend trying that one out
I'm just kind of giving because my
favorite tonight
I think that's oh that's all that I
brought out I'm gonna go ahead and look
at the chat and make sure I didn't miss
anything one sure I miss something if
you didn't leave a comment in chat and I
didn't get a chance to read what you
said please come back in like 20
minutes and leave a comment down below

don't want to miss out on real amazing
knowledge you know we gotta work
together we gotta do it together
Tiffany says the sila glitters are
overpriced I can't you know any makeup
it's over $20 to be super pricks you
know based on how much it costs to
produce this stuff I mean even I mean
all makeup I thought this is gonna be a
lot cheaper except for maybe this this I
feel like right place there but you know
it's all kind of replaced but I feel
like there really isn't a formula that I
know of it's exactly like this because
the way that it is it's like a cream and
though it's just I mean I don't know any
creams like this so yes it's overpriced
but I don't know any other way to get
that kind of glow in this kind of format
if you do know a way please tell me I
need to know because I want more of
these and I don't want to spend the
money I don't like that no I do really
like them alive but do I need them no I
don't really need them
86% is how I found your channel they had
one of your videos on there oh so cool
yeah it Coastal Scents I do I have a
nice relationship with them even though
I don't always give them positive review
things don't really like me for
something
all right I'm gonna go ahead and Bob

amazing pigments for cheap oh no I mean
