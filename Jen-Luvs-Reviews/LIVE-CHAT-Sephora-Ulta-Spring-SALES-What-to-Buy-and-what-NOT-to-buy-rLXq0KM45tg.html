and make up Chad I always like I'm not
prepared every time this thing comes on
how is everybody doing it's so good to
have you here i'm actually dressed and
ready today I was scrambling to get
everything together I've got a whole
table full of goodness to talk to you
guys about about things that I would
recommend and not recommend that you
would get for your sephora coupon and
your old to coupon the deal is that at
least as far as my understanding we can
ask the collective brain in a moment
about the old to sale because i'm a
little confused by the old sale a little
bit but we'll give it a second so so
fora is having a sale y believe it's ten
percent off for VIPs for the entire
store and ten fifteen percent off for
vib rouge is for the entire store now
you have to use your card in order to
get if you'd like going through your
account in order to get the discount you
don't need like a special like code or
anything you just need to be you using
your account in order to use the
discount now with Alta they're sending
out email coupons now I did not get my
email coupon so I talked to the
collective brain over on periscope and
they were saying that you have to email
ulta and say hey I didn't get my coupon
and then it will email it to you I'm not
sure how long the coupons are good for
but supposedly they are out now so I
believe platinum is twenty percent off
anything and then if you're not platinum
I think its twenty percent off with some
exceptions is my understanding but we'll
talk to the collective brain and make
sure that those are the exact deals now
i'm pretty sure that the old Lisa 401
goes I think from the 7th to the 14th I
want to say I was getting ready and I'm
like should I didn't have time to make
double check everything is like ten
o'clock came by us so I I'm gonna go
into the collective brain right now we
pause this I'm going to the collective
brain right now and just make sure let's
see Julie says she got an email from
Ulta twenty percent off yes yes and then
they're good until the ninth april ninth
nikki says at ulta thank you so much
than use this is I'm spoiled by the
collective bring because you know I
don't need to know anything because
they'll be here
me up it's terrible it's a terrible
spoiling tabitha was the first one here
hello Tabitha I'm gonna take a second
and just say hello to the people in the
collective brain and then we'll get into
the products now it's not just going to
be me recommending these things it's
going to be the 100 people or so that
are watching this live usually we have
anywhere from 50 to about 300 people
watching life so I'm going to be reading
in the collective brain all of their
wonderful ideas as well and then that
way we can all work together make sure
we only buy the most awesome things to
have to worry about returning things
especially if we don't have an altar
Sephora near us and we can't drive an
hour to go here and we're ordering
online you know I mean we won't want now
to save you some time and some money

Break just started and I am so jealous

right so anyway let's go ahead
go into some of the products now I've
kind of got a mixed martial mish-mosh
here I got drugstore products for those
of you that like the old to drugstore
side I've got some stuff there for you
I've got some high-end stuff both ulta
and sephora so let's go ahead and get
rockin oh and I also want to tell you
what I bought with the coupon my friend
Shannon who always has my back with
shanna q she sent me her ulta coupon
because she can't use hers in canada
because apparently the coupons are not
good in canada I don't know it's very
upsetting Oh Krista good moon and Krista
edmondo monthly obsessions come yes
hello Krista I'm sorry I didn't mean to
miss you I don't want to hurt your
feelings I love you ok yes it is a peach
balanced there's a peach palette over
here we're going to be talking about
that in a moment I also want to tell you
what I got with Shannon's coupon I could
have emailed and gotten my own coupon
but to Shannon had one and she wasn't
going to use it it just easing your deep
shame so that's what i did i'll tell you
what i got later alright let's go ahead
and start off at the drugstore side of
ulta and then we'll work our way over
yes I there is a peach palette I don't
know if you guys can be able to get the
peach belt for the snow but I did want
to mention so the first thing I wanted
to mention is makeup revolution products
now these are relatively new to my
collection I have used this one the most
this is the girls on film palette and
I've really been enjoying this and you
can see their shapes for lots and lots
and lots of different skin tones here
and it's very enjoyable to use its it
was my number one in my countdown this
month as far as the best product that I
tried in the month of March and they're
just really easy to use very um got a
nice separation of color they don't
muddy on the eyes which is really
fabulous and then you've got a nice mix
of mass here the mats are all down here
and then you've got mostly statins over
here you do have some shimmers while not
yours yes they're like satin mostly
statins you got in here this one is a
very light set and there really isn't
much of a sheen to that with these some
of these get really shimmery in the
middle but there's no sparkler clitter
it's just more of a sheen very very nice
here I also got the iconic one now let
me show you this
I've met to get this horse and I want to
show you the person here we go okay i
want to show you the comparison will do
a little bit of swatching is i haven't
done this yet this is the makeup
revolution iconic one right there and
we're going to go ahead and compare that
to the rock this is the lorac mega Pro
and i'm just going to just grab a random
shade that looks similar let's do
champagne and i'm going to do finger
swatches just you can get the tone but
you know that that the best way to tell
whether a shade is good is to really put
on your eye or at least put it on with a
brush so please keep that in mind so
finger number one is going to be lorac
finger number two is the iconic and
we'll do finger number three is going to
go into this naked palette and we're
going to swatch sin which is a very
famous shade get a little dug a little
deep in that one into deep say I'm in
too deep oh and I accidentally got a
little bit of eyeliner because I didn't
want y'all to Sir about that okay so
lorac makeup revolution sin okay so here
is the rock here's makeup revolution and
here's Urban Decay's sin uh-huh that's
what I'm talking about that's what I'm
talking about so if you are looking for
a good dupe for either the lorac Pro or
the naked the Urban Decay Naked this is
where you want to go I feel like this
quality why seems to be in my limited
experience with it seems to be one of
the best dukes that i have seen as far
as quality it's a little cheesy looking
i have to say it kind of reminds me of
those cheesy little elf pellets that are
really powdery and horrible but it works
it's very nice so yeah they're very nice
so definitely a recommend on these as
far as definitely worth time i also got
be this is the mermaid palette now this
one that says mermaids forever now this
one I have found a few missed shades in
here this one over here was a big mess
I've used a few shades in here this one
wasn't quite
amazing for me but it's very fun it's a
fun one to play with I definitely think
that it's kind of where this one seems
to be kind of where my Coastal Scents
palette are as far as awesomeness it's
okay it's all right this one I don't
love as much as I'm loving the other two
just as a suggestion and I'd love to
hear in the collective brain what
everyone else is thinking about makeup
revolution products I did get a blush
from them as well and no this time later
from makeup revolution is the baked
highlighter in peach like this is the
only one that they had left now this
does not go on super super opaque it's
not you're not going to get a back of
highlight out of this it's not going to
be mary-lou manizer it's not going to be
that big bright bold opaque pop of color
it's going to give you though a very
nice glow and it lasts for me just as
long if not a little bit longer than the
Becca the Becca disappears on me within
like three hours that Becca is gone this
one will last me four or five hours so
for a highlighter from me I'm pretty
happy with it and it's beautiful you see
the design in there it's absolutely
gorgeous and I do have one of the
blushes I don't want to dig for it right
now but I know it's over there and the
blush was very nice as well that's all I
got from the brand's really enjoying it
amanda says that she loves their blush
they're so pigmented and then christmas
says the prices from makeup revolution
are crazy they're very inexpensive um
let's see uh what else was going on whoo
Tracy says yes the blush and highlight
palette is pretty darn great ok I'm
trying to read if see if there's
anything in here having to do with the
topic the blush palette I got Krista
says the blush palette I got comes with
two highlighters and it's good fantastic
thank you so much collective brain on
that one now let's go ahead and talk
about a brand that is only available
online at Ulta and it's Jake at Beauty I
was really sad to see Jacob you didn't
make it in their stores a couple of
recommends for them would be there
blushes these I think are like two or
three dollars on their website and but
especially these big trio eyeshadows
they are so super fab so super fat let
me see if I can get a swatch on this
Jake at this one is in the shade cherry
fudge sundae they are all shimmer so
don't expect
get a complete look out of one of these
babies kind of swatch it over here of
course it's peachy I was just trying to
find something similar but yes so yeah I
mean it's really a very very nice
product it's very creamy very long
wearing and exceed selection is
beautiful I've also heard wonderful
things about the from the collective
brain about these eyeshadows that
they're very wonderful now do you want
to tell you these worth sets me for
review a very long time ago but I do
like to mention that of course that
doesn't affect my review at all like as
far as me telling you an honest review
the fact that they sent these to me they
sent needs to be so long ago my
commitment to them is way done but I
still talk about them because they still
absolutely love them and they are still
online Krista said um Jake at was in a
store two months ago then they left
exactly good another song line they are
still online oh my gosh we really see
her hello barelli's the hashtag Kerala
Morelli's like big in the payroll of
euros all right last thing for drug
store oh no couple more things I wanted
to do a little shout out to some
Kardashian beauty this was the number
two on my countdown this is the blush in
lawyer ombre number 15 it's a wonderful
wonderful blush it's very buildable I
would compare this to my high-end
blushes it is fantastic I don't want to
love it because I don't love the
Cardassians did you guys see that music
video oh my gosh what was that it was
like it made absolutely no sense like I
don't know I guess some music videos
just don't make sense but music video
that went out i'm talking for Kylie
cosmetics for the lip glosses it was
like all that crime and robbing people
and I was like really that's what you're
doing with your lip glosses you're
robbing people like no anyway so so yeah
so with that I do really like the blush
so I'm also really really liking the
mascara as well mascara is fantastic
this is the one in it's called the
quickie I'll show you the wand very
quickly it's kind of Christmas tree
shaped it's not the most magical mascara
ever but it's very nice especially if
you are
have longer lashes and you just need a
little bit of volume this is really fab
what I wanted to show you for real for
reals was these four drugstore this is a
lash sensational by Maybelline this is
my holy grail drugstore mascara it is
super Fab the one in the pink tube this
one's also really good this is the one
that's called the luscious full fan
effect there's just a difference in the
wand I feel like the formula is very
similar so that one's turned that way
and then this one alright and then this
one's shaped like that so yes very good
Melanie says my favorite mascara I mean
it's really good there's no reason to
buy high-end mascaras when these exist
there's no reason it's there's no reason
these these are good these are really
good and I think they're better so
that's just me and everybody that I love
that wine Julie says i love the lash
sensational court says i love that
mascara and tablet making people laugh
all right one thing i wanted to show you
that i thought was very mediocre was the
benefit tinted primer they're real this
is supposed to go on before your mascara
to give you an extra length and volume I
really like my clinic nut clinique my
lawn calm sales boost your XL way better
than this I feel like it works a little
bit like if you've already got some help
on your lashes you may really enjoy this
Vicki back short sparse lashes like me
don't really go whole Lots definitely
not worth the price tag definitely not
especially with this exists this is
gonna give it to you without that and
this doesn't really help this one that
much like it's just me yeah okay so
that's kind of all I have for drug store
oh no I have one more thing okay this is
a shout out to Valerie okay Valerie in
the community whatever i'm getting ready

one it's a good one and they do sell
that at those places sorry about that
you guys I appreciate that thank you
okay so let's go ahead oh I wanted to
tap into the collective brain and see if
there was anything else drugstore that
you think we should talk about yes I do
do set bird Cheryl and I love it and an
easy says do a favorite nail video I
could do that it'll be all juleps she
looks are plagued by far my favorite
I didn't fix the camera again is it
wrong as it mess up again when I met let
me put this no it's not messed up it
looks good now are you just laughing at
me because it took me so long to fix it
is that what it is that what's happening
I'm going to put the camera over on the
side so in case that happens again I can
see myself there we go all right there
we go semper it's fabulous we need to
see Andy branch at that's I don't have
enough see that's the Nikki thing I
don't have enough indie stuff chick
tasty Tracy says the flower library
barrymore but I don't think they sell
that at all times afore up Melissa says
the elf mad format palette if you can
find it at Ulta I don't think they sell
sell it at Ulta I don't know drugstore
brushes use my ELF blushes more than my
high-end brushes oh my elf brush is one
the hand brushes yes and to show you
these these are real Techniques brushes
this one is from the Real Techniques
bold metals line this is the blush brush
I really like the bold metals block but
I like the boat metals brushes I also
like the traditional line this one is
the blush brush but always use this for
all of your face powder and then this
one is called the setting brush it's I
use this for setting powder down here
it's pretty fab I've also use it for
highlight my blurry what is going on
here I've also used it for highlight so
definitely recommend on the Real
Techniques brushes so that was it for
drug store let's go ahead and move into
some high-end stuff Oh essence mascaras
absolutely oh my gosh chris is like
essence mascaras in the pink tube yes
yes okay so let's go ahead and go into
some of the high-end stuff that I
recommend so I think you guys will look
it over here so let's just talk about
let's get the get the pink elephant the
peach elephant out of the room this is
the two-faced sweet peach palette okay
if you have been dying to get this and
this is like you're like its life and
you're like freaking out over it and
you're like oh my gosh I have to get it
I will not be able to live I will stop
breathing right now if I don't have this
palette just chill it's okay it's really
it's not as magical as everyone says it
is it's it's a nice palette but I don't
think that this is better than my
original chocolate bar palette I
actually like
the peanut butter palette better as far
as the consistency of the quality of the
shadows but this also has more more
margin for error but I mean it's I'm
going to do a whole review comparing the
peach the peanut butter and jelly and
the original chocolate bar palette I'll
do a whole review comparing them
specifically but I wouldn't if you see
this in the store and it's calling to
you I would say you could try it and
then with the option to return but if
don't die over it it was not worth me
staying up all night one night trying to
get this it was not worth it i was
trying to get the original launch it
wasn't worth all that the scent is very
candied peach like everyone is saying um
and it does taste very good to try I did
taste my peach ballot and it was yummy
it was yummy it tasted very good um but
yeah there's there isn't a whole lot of
peach in it I really do like the candied
peach shade that one reminds me a lot of
the the sugar pop palette where it's
kind of a mat with like some sparkle
over top of it it's very fun and it
looks like you know like just peachy and
Bellini will be like these gorgeous
colors but they're very like the peach
colors are let the weakest in
pigmentation the hardest to work with I
do not have the bon bons palette even
with wonderful things about it just
watch the video my friend Kristen game
and she just reviewed bon bons palette
and loves it I really do honestly like
if I were to pick out of the two to
recommend i would pick the peanut butter
over the peach just because I feel like
the shades are more consistently good
jelly swatches really really bad but it
really does last a long time on the eyes
I was surprised at how well that perform
the one that didn't perform as well as
far as the lasting power was jamming
which surprised me so you know I mean I
think you should go where your heart
tells you to go but if I were to
recommend one I would recommend the
peanut butter over the peach that's just
me at this point so that's that's just
me um Morales says peaches lasts forever
now Mir Ali you have to tell me this
Morelli is of a medium to deeper skin
tone when I first saw me release watch
this on periscope you could not see it
on her skin at all it looked
very very weak so me rally you have to
give me the update how is the page
palette on your skin tone you have to
tell me I need to know the collective
brain needs to know miss krueger says
the chocolate bar is my in the best in
my opinion only one that I'm not alerted
to that and the lorac interesting okay
Melanie's way home it Shannon says I
think I might like the bonbons better
than the OG chocolate bar I haven't used
that in a bit though Erica says i love
the PB and J pallet anyone try the new
Laura Geller highlighter I have not but
could you have some Lord Geller products
on the table sandy says it seems peanut
butter may be duped by morphe 35o i
don't know that i don't own the morphe
35o her great things about it though
Rosie says get the bon bons palette you
need it trying not to you're a bad
influence all right Bianca says yeah
brown girl here it's okay so Bianca you
got this and it was just okay for you
Elise says I heard that the peach pot
was pretty do pible with other chocolate
bar palettes um let's see Kristin says
Morelli Darnay mr. scope last night
didn't get the notification going to
watch the replay okay Oh Morelli says
nope I have to pack it on and on and on
but it lasts forever another tip Nikki
gave us because nikki is like you know
this is a thing I think a lot of people
that make youtube videos think that they
know everything and just because you
don't make youtube videos doesn't mean
you don't know everything and Nikki's
one of those people that knows
everything so one thing she told me was
to take some of these lighter shades
take georgia or peaches and cream pact
that on the lid first before you put on
the other shades and it really increases
the pop and the separation of the shades
so that's what i've been doing enough
and having great success with it so
deepa says exchange the peach belt with
the bonbon I can't I got off the
two-faced website and I'm not going to
set it to face that just be sad just be
sad so anyway will it move on from the
peach and the peanut butter and let's
move on to some other things we talked
about Laura Geller Laura Geller if you
see any products in this little swirly
form they are so fabulous I also have
the highlighter
the older highlighter was it gilded
honey I think is what it's called this
one is in papaya is the name of the
shade oh my gosh these are so amazing
these are ulta and I love them oh my
gosh I love them oh look at that ensued
but it doesn't come off like that on the
cheeks it comes off very subtly on the
cheeks and it's buildable that's like
full strength clown face this one is
Matt um yes I have some lotion on my
hands let me put on the other hand and
make sure it has a tad bit of a sheen to
it but it's not like crazy like it's the
tiniest tiniest bit I wouldn't say that
it's fully max no it's not fully Matt
but it's really good Yeldon honey is
wonderful especially if you are of not
lighter than me but a little deeper than
me because it's got that golden color
like if you are like me rellies shape
you know one more l looks like you're
like a medium like if you've got that
latina beautifulness like it golden
honey it will be beautiful on you I need
a deeper skinship toes than that like
who speaking of blushes I also wanted to
give a shout out to the backup blushes I
do want on my wish list for Sephora when
I just to get my sale I want to get the
new becca shimmering of blushes I want
to get at least one of those I have the
UM the coral looking one like the orange
e1 the one that kind of looks like a
tarts tipsy I have that in my cart and I
want it I want it I want it I want it
Helen says I've been consistently
disappointed Lord geller products really
I am so surprised Wow oh my goodness
sandy says I like the Geller blushes
you're showing not the highlighter it
sits on top of the skin see I haven't
had that same experience it's so strange
shannon says I love Laura Geller one in
ballerina it's beautiful as well and she
loves it very interesting so this blush
is a really good one I use this one
mostly for winter this one is a sweet
pea I'm just very pigmented the lasting
power on Becca stuff is not fab for me
but it's pretty nice it's pretty nice
morelli says awesome just got gilded
honey and then Kiki says she loves
gilded honey Kiki as the
medium to a little deeper than where r
le c 0 c yr says I hate the Lord gala
foundations but her blushes look so
pretty a lot of says but all the shimmer
Deepa says I want hourglass so bad I
like the hourglass ones honestly I like
the Laura Geller one's better than the
hourglass ones I do i do I like them a
lot I can't help it the Sephora sale is
april through the 14th i want to say
it's like the seventh through the 14th
something like that um jamie says what
are a few highlighter higher-end
must-haves with slippies foundation
highlighter and Bronk I don't know what
that means powder bronzer I don't know
what that means I'm so sorry not miss
I'm not getting that Cheryl says I like
her blushes but her shadows are not for
me I haven't had good luck with her
shadows either with laura geller shadows
I haven't either alright so let's go
ahead and go back into some of the other
things i want to show you i'm going to
show you a couple things from the tour
de force of the sea collection because
this is very very popular right now I
did return the eyeshadow palette but not
because it was bad it was because it
wasn't great and I knew I wasn't going
to reach for it I knew with the
collection that I have I knew that it
was something that was not going to get
used it was fine but it wasn't like oh
my gosh amazing i love this palette you
know what I mean lasting Hera was just
okay hmm Cheryl wants to know is anyone
tried the new Josie Maran um ran marin
josie maran foundation I have heard
wonderful things about that wonderful
things about that alright so let's talk
about the foundation this is the tour
train force of the sea foundation this
is in the shade like neutral now this
foundation goes on like a stinking dream
it is so gorgeous on my skin it is
beautiful like leaves the most gorgeous
natural finish also it lasts for ever
like I have never had a foundation look
this the same no not the same not going
to say the same have that much silt on
by the end of the day
the lasting power is wonderful here
comes the rub here comes the rub if you
have fine lines you may want to get a
sample first if you have big pores you
may want to get a sample first because i
have found this settles into my fine
lines and also make accentuates my pores
by the end of the day thankfully i do
have smaller pores so that doesn't
really bother me a whole lot and you
can't really see it in my fine lines
unless you look up really close but if
you do a close-up of my skin like we do
a close-up shot of my skin at the end of
the day with us it does not look good
from a distance I feel like I'm looking
all right when you get up real close
that's not looking so good so just
warning you about this but overall I'm
really really enjoying it I'm just
hoping that people don't notice by the
end of the day that it's settling into
my face so yes this is this is going to
be a win for me but at the same time
it's kind of like it may not be a win
for everybody also you have to be really
careful this is a water-based foundation
so you have a silicone based primer this
is going to break up on your face so bad
it's going to be horrible so I had
actually been using this without a
primer and I've been liking that much
better than using it with a primer so
Gina says Jen had high hopes for this
foundation at 50 every line shows yeah
I'm get a sample and try it out if you
can get a sample and try it out that's
my recommendation let's see will work
for oily skin I would look up some
reviews I would look up for some reviews
I I can't recommend it for oily skin I
just can't I can't um merely says oh
crap maybe not because I have poor oh
gosh okay dark spark says hi all late
but finally made it glad you're here
Ilana says Angie said the same thing
angie from hot and flash game yes I
trust Angie with my life I don't know
Angie personally but she has great
reviews if you're even if you are she
does she does a channel specifically for
women who are more mature targeting the
I guess 40 and up I'm getting closer to
40 so I guess I'm becoming more mature
but but she has if you if you're not
subscribed to hot and flashy you must
you must you must alright this is one
that is a big huge awesome
this this is the torch so fine eyeliner
that is what is on my hand right there
that will not come off I will do a brand
new swatch for you it is so black and so
amazing oh my gosh I'm so in love with
this it stays on all day and this is my
kicker when I do a liquid eyeliner this
is what really gets me there's a few
things number one the tip must be super
fine check it must be very black check
uh and the big thing is the wing the
wing on the side cannot rub off through
the day cannot rub off because flying
crooked is not my thing I hate it when
I've got one one side I've accidentally
rubbed and then the other side is gone
this will stay this will stay now where
I'm what I'm so reviewing this is I want
to wait a month so for my favorites next
month because I am concerned about any
liquid eyeliner drying out over the
month so i am going to see how this lass
as far as the drying out oh the other
thing is the bend of the tip you don't
want the tip to be too stiff you'd also
don't want it to be too bendy it's got
the perfect tip it's pretty pretty
stinking wonderful and I don't say that
lightly it takes a lot for me to be
impressed so it let me see is it a brush
or a felt tip it I think it might be a
felt tip it's very hard to see let me
see if I can scrape it down a little bit
it's definitely a felt tip because I
can't scrape down any bristles I don't
want to put my finger in the very tip of
it it's a felt tip it's a photo yes
mm-hmm Krishna says the only thing I
like from Tarte is the blush as well
this might be something you might want
to check out I you know tart it's been a
very miss Brant for me as well but
lately I don't know what's up they've
been they've been stepping up their game
a little bit so anyway the other thing I
wanted to show you was the lipstick this
is the only one that i have i got a
little samples like a 500-point perk
this is beach bum and this is the
rainforest of the sea lipstick it's like
something splashed something I can't see
it because drench lips splash am I
really doing that
it's that time in my life apparently um
and it's it's wonderful it is a
fantastic formula lasting power is
really nice fades down really nice you
feel super moisturizing super hydrating
just a really nice formula I'm trying so
hard not to buy more of these really
trying hard it's hard because they're so
stinking expensive and it's like oh do I
really need more lipstick no i don't and
it's like oh but it's really good the
tart liner only comes in black Christy
wanted to know cuesta says the pure
cosmetics new serum foundation seems
nice I might get it but I kind of want
the Urban Decay face to face says this
is my first time joining one of your
chest I've learned so much already
thanks oh I'm so glad that's wonderful
for lady says ladies I an issue mascara
not staying put even waterproof any
ideas you probably have watery eyes hmm
you guys collective brain help her Alana
says PS jenya the first person to say my
name right on the first try congrats Mel
done yes you know long it took me the
same your le correctly oh my gosh a long
time so I i I've been makes a lot it's
important to me Rosie says buy at the
imax over the tart maybe that's a good
idea i am going to be IMATS if you are
going to i'm asking to be i mess on
saturday with john we're going to be
walking around so if you see you can't
i'm at please please please come give me
a hug so I can take a picture with you
because that's important to me to take
pictures with people so that I have
memories of everybody that I've met one
as many pictures of people in the
collective brain as possible or if you
don't want me to take your picture
that's okay to just come up and say hi
anyway alright so let's go ahead and
move on I say to do I'm saying make sure
to miss anything sandra says the
Jessie's drill liquid eyeliner is so
good you should try it Sandra Jessie's
Girl liquid eyeliner is my holy grail is
my absolute holy grail eyeliner this may
need it it might it might we just have
to decide whether the price difference
is worth it that's what it comes down to
because performance wise they're the
same this one's really it's thinner
though it's a little easier to work with
I hate to say it because Jessie's Girl
has been my heart for a year I bought
three of those things three or four of
them i bought Jessie's Griner's and I'll
repurchase stuff ever
so and just a black one though the
colored ones don't tend to last as long
as the black I don't know what's up with
that they have a bunch of colors but
deep I want to meet you too i'll go to
India I want to meet you too I'm all
right so let's move on that distracted
one thing I have to show you I have to
show you Urban Decay primer potion in
Eden I have to show you this oh my gosh
if you don't own Eden and you got your
coupon and you want to get an amazing
eye shadow primer that's what it looks
like and it will it need some
discoloration it's beautiful if you have
a mac paint pot you probably don't need
this but it's similar to the Mac Paint
Pots as far as the opacity of it and how
it makes your eyeshadow stay on longer
and it just gives you a really nice base
to start with or if you're like you
using the NYX jumbo pencil in milk if
you use that before to kind of get
yourself like a white sheet of paper to
start with ok but you don't want
something stark white this is a great
place to start it is so wonderful i
think daniel says good old Eden Daniel
knows me Daniel knows me jenny says I'm
going to Arizona the week of my meds oh
um what is that Maddy Maddy gave some
kind of emoji I don't even know what
that is what is that supposed to be
justin says such a good alta coupon
justine says good ulta suggestion oh my
gosh Eden's amazing somebody just said I
love eating and went by too fast
Samantha says I got this because of you
and I love it yes I'm so glad Natasha
says myself and my seven week old are
just listening watching you this is the
longest he has been still he's just
watching you hello hi it's good to see
you thank you for watching my video um
ec says I got the original UD the
original Urban Decay primer potion is
good but it doesn't give you that muting
out of discoloration that this one does
I did return the one in my nurse in it's
the one in my nurse in is very similar
to the original except for it has a
little bit of sparkle in it and I just
wasn't loving it I wasn't loving it so I
returned it a night with it ania I'm
hoping an ayah is the older coupon for
everyone I don't I think so but I think
you email ulta and see what they say say
hey I've heard that there's a
he percent off coupon going on right now
but i didn't receive one in my email and
then give them your account becky says
don't wear heels the I that I love you
Becky Becky knows I when I went to
generation beauty I gave myself a stress
fracture ish thing in my foot in October
I'm still healing from walking in high
heels a generation beauty in October so
I will not wear high heels I'm ads I do
need to get a new outfit though i do
need 20 Mandy's here hi Mandy all right
Courtney I have watery eyes and I love
make up forever aqua eyes it stays on
for me thank you so much for following
up on that Courtney with the request for
knowing what math mascara that will stay
on eyes that don't like mascara to stay
off all right let's move on okay oh I
want to show these because these are
kind of like a dark horse in the eye
shadow at high end I shadow the buxom
customizable palettes what I recommend
if you're in storey swatch these babies
because they really are fabulous I've
heard the ones that are the the newest
one isn't quite as good as these these
are individual shadows and what you do
is you pop this out and you put the
individual shadows in but the quality of
these things is so good and I'm not a
big buxom person like buxom has kind of
always been a little man for me you know
but when I got these i got these with FC
points i was very lucky i like it sold
out really fast with the FC points but I
was so thankful to get these oh my gosh
they're so stinkin amazing this one is
and I'll swatch a couple for you even
though you know finger swatches are only
so much but oh my gosh they're so good I
got my friend Sandra Sandra loves makeup
she's in the community she I got her to
buy some of these when we went to the
mall together once and she like was
dying over them and she's a big high-end
like she loves her mac eyeshadows like
she's really big and all that stuff and
she was loving them so definite
recommend when he's buxom singles but
swatch the ones you like here's the
other ones that I have this one is
really nice this gold one and why i
don't use these more i need to use these
more often run out of real estate here
really beautiful really beautiful and
the other thing too is you can get
shades like if you see shades that you
know you don't have in your collection
you customize you get the shades only
the ones that really really work for you
you know like you don't have to worry
about someone else is on its current
you're not going to use half the shades
Justine says i love the buxom eyeliners
and Rosie says the bucks and mascara is
my favorite of all time and you know
what's funny Rosie is that I have a
sample of this is the full and fabulous
vanity lash mascara and this was sitting
in my drawer and I wasn't using it and I
put it on I was like oh my gosh this is
a great mascara like why have I not been
using this this isn't show off black and
it's a wonderful mascara on the brush is
ginormous but it works really really
well um Oh Freddie I feel like this is
just as good I do maybe this one's a
maybe a tiny bit better cutting bit but
it's not worth the price difference for
me it's just such a tiny difference the
other one is to steal a huge mascara
that I really like just as much as this
but you know Jenny says about the buxom
lip products are great they're blushes
are also very good Krista says I love
the Bucks on palette that I made Shannon
says there maybe I should get a buxom
instead of NARS you know I had really
bad luck with nar's really bad but I
don't get the highway north and I know
there's some diehard NARS fans out there
diehard NARS fans that are so loyal and
I seriously like everything I've ever
tried from NARS it's been like men
especially for the price point because
it's even more than a lot of the brands
that I love it's even more than two
faced and more than what other brands do
I love right now von d sort of it used
to be one that I loved and now she's had
so many miss products I don't even know
about Kat Von D anymore but um but yeah
I don't know like a lot of misc stuff
for NARS for me Justin's has a green not
an arse fan tiffany says NARS is not the
best in my opinion I think that maybe I
think maybe it just gets a lot of hype
on YouTube I don't know cam says I love
the steal a huge lash and Julie says you
don't use them for the same reason I
don't use a lot of my makeup I have too
much makeup I'm an ad
yeah and I have too much makeup I'm an
addict too I'm with you we can be
together in that Helen says the NARS I
shadows are great and I've only had
limited experience with nar's I shadows
maybe I should try more Gina says me and
ours are not friends Missy wants to know
if the NARS concealer is worth it I
don't know I honest you don't know I've
heard great things about though I've
heard wonderful things um let me see
what else I want to show you on this
table about other stuff okay we can talk
about finishing powder we haven't talked
about this finishing powder this was the
holiday packaging but this is the
original mineral veil by bare minerals
oh my gosh if you don't mind a little
bit of powder this is like it makes me
feel like I'm in the 1950s when I use
this like it just it feels very classic
and beautiful it's very soft on the skin
and it's messy and I love it I don't
care that it's messy because it just so
fine and beautiful it is one of those
just classic iconic great products if
you go into fours website and you look
up their reviews for the mineral veil
and also bare minerals foundation you'll
find tens of thousands of positive
reviews on this stuff I mean it's been
around forever and it's amazing and what
I do is I use my my blush brush here my
Real Techniques blush brush and I flip
the cat over I dip this in here and then
I tap it off into the cap and then I go
like that I use the product from the cap
and then I put the lid back on because
usually all of the product will will
collect in the cap and I'll be able to
use everything that's in the cap all
over my face so that way I'm not dipping
over and over again into the products
I'm hoping it will help it to last
longer Michelle says hi Jen just made my
buxom palette and now it's my favorite
one I own it stays on all day long and
it's beautiful and I picked all the
shades that is exactly what I'm talking
about Alana says so in so envious of
powder uter users have dry skin so no no
no have you ever tried a finishing
powder though like I don't know I don't
know look on and see if a seat look and
see how does the bare minerals powder
compared to the Laura Mercier one I
don't own the Laura Mercier 1 i'm sorry
Shannon says agree love the bare
minerals min
Vale I've been loving bareminerals
lately yes and speaking of bare minerals
here's another one that i want to
recommend and i have heard from my drum
i skip friends i have heard that this
works well for dry skin this is a baby
sample of it that i got and this has
been one of my favorite concealers of
all time and i was shocked at how good
this stuff is this is in summer best
this is the bare minerals multitasking
sqf 20 concealer i've talked about this
a million bazillion times alright we're
going to do a little test here I've done
this in live chat before but I want to
do it again because we have new people
and I know if you were here for the last
time I did this I apologize ahead of
time you've seen this before but we sing
see if we can get this to work all right
here we go foundation is a little darker
than normally is all right can you see
the difference hopefully you can see the
difference as far as the concealing I
can't look at myself and look at the
camera at the same time so it's just
really really really nice as far as the
concealing of the dark circles hoping
you can see it I don't know if you can't
not but I love it I absolutely love it I
have to put on the other side now I
don't think I put concealer on this
morning so I feel like I'm getting away
with it oh my gosh see you cyr says I
have disk and I don't use it what are
you kidding me mir ali says it's lighter
but it does conceal dark circles really
well I'm hoping that's you're seeing
that as well hopefully that's coming off
on camera because it's definitely coming
off in real life so I so I definitely
brighten my undereyes hopefully it's not
too bright because i forgot to use my
foundation that's a little too dark to
the day so it's a little bit bright yes
definitely brighter but hopefully you
can see that it call it cover the dark
circles too so I hope they don't look
too freaky but too bright mmm blended in
blended in blended in alright so that
was another thing I wanted to tell you
about that I really really enjoyed
another thing let's say oh I want to
talk to you for a minute about
the to face new matte lipsticks to face
is one of my is is probably my favorite
high-end brand because it's the most
consistent i will say that i cannot
recommend you these lipsticks I just
can't they don't wear down well I got
the shades when in doubt hey girl and
then I got one more that I know it so is
it over there no I don't know where it
is I'm not going to search for it but
anyway they wear down terribly hey girl
this was horrible in the way or down of
it it was so bad like it's a beautiful
shade but unless you're willing to
reapply this throughout the day don't
don't do it because you'll end up with
that patching nastiness that happens
with some like cheap lipsticks mm-hmm
it's ugly it's ugly the initial
application is beautiful very
moisturizing and they smell like
licorice that's the truth but mmm
alright and then when in doubt is the
lighter shade the lighter shades get
that little crusty right here on my lips
into face I got three of these things to
face is one of my kids is my favorite
high-end brand and to face lipsticks or
my Holy Grail lipsticks she takes a lot
for me to be like no because i love the
la creme lip sex you up and then who is
that diana set sad to hear i love little
crumbs i love the look REM stew but i
can't recommend the matte ones
unfortunately so yeah i know i'm very
sad i'm very very sad cyr says busting
bisque out today especially because i've
been sick for the past few days need all
the things i can need all the help I can
get because the concealer is no longer
concealing yes I hear you the melted
Matt the melted liquid lipsticks yes i
have tried those and I do very much
enjoy the newer formula better than the
older formula the older formula kind of
wore down a bit patchy but the ones the
chocolate ones i really enjoy a lot i
have quite a few of them except for the
one and diamonds it's something
chocolate diamonds that one has like
straight-up glitter in it like silver
glitter is yucky it's very yucky hmm i
don't recommend that one but i do let
the other ones though very much very
very much i know he'll in 10 minutes
left Helen's my time keeper
if you want to continue this
conversation speaking of Helen you want
to continue this conversation after the
10 minutes you can pop over to our
facebook page we have what it's groups /
what's up in makeup facebook.com slash
group / what's up in makeup and there's
always great conversation going on over
there about all of this kind of stuff so
feel free to pop by the facebook group
after this is over if you'd like to
continue talking all right so anyway
let's see what else I want to show you
Oh what so many brands today this was a
surprising winner for me this is the
smashbox brow tech shaping brow powder
that's what i have on my eyebrows today
and especially if you like Instagram
browse this is definitely going to be
something for you it's got like a spongy
tip there's powder inside here and what
I did was add row drew the line and then
I filled it in and then ice polluted it
out and it's wonderful wonderful
wonderful wonderful really really like
that a lot Helen says I try the liquid
lipstick from Too Faced only ones that
I've tried ineffective punch says no I
mean that they have released a new
melted lining different tubes that are
dried down a liquid lipsticks oh no
those brand new ones no girlfriend I did
not get those I have not gotten the
brand new to face liquid lipsticks I
have not tried those they just came out
and by the time I got on there they were
all sold out but I will tell you that I
have them in my Sephora cart if they
come back in stock i will be buying some
I want some very very very very much um
Elise says just the facebook group is
fantastic yay and then Reich uh says
first time here with you super cool i'm
so glad that you're here yes Instagram
christine lee 314 excellent youtube
channel um ok you only one as I wanted
to tell you what I got at Ulta because I
pretty lace that big old to order let me
sing I think about to search for and
then I want to tell you what's in my
Sephora shopping cart do to do I'm
searching searching on the phone it's
the ineffective punch has everything in
to face keeps getting is sold out a SUP
that's because there's such a
consistently good brand and it's really
hard to find a consistently good brand
for anything in makeup there's always
brands that they
mess it up I wish they would learn to
not release something if it's terrible
because they would they would have so
much so much if they would stop doing
that ok so here is my cart ok so first
thing I got look there's my cart that
was what I bought so I got did I need to
make any sense that even finish that
last thought basically what I'm trying
to say is if a company company stopped
releasing things that were terrible then
people would trust them more and people
will buy more stuff from them and that
drives me nuts drives me nuts ok I
looking at you kat von d exactly daniel
exactly alright so speaking of that
while Daniels here if you didn't see my
favorites and fails video I'm like
putting my arm up here on the chair and
shaking you I'm sorry um the kat von d
eye primer the in the sickie thing i
didn't like it it's not okay I would get
eaten instead if you want an opaque
cancelling out discoloration I primer
and get eat in from urban decay instead
of the kat von d eye primer just so you
know ok so here we go so in my cart this
is what I purchased from Ulta the Urban
Decay um afterglow eight-hour powder
highlighter in sin I did get that I also
got the naked skin one and done which is
the new very light it's like I supposed
to be like a light coverage foundation
II kind of thing in medium light I got
the makeup revolution ultra contour
palette I got the Loreal voluminous
butterfly sculpt mascara in blackest
black that's the new one enough you'll
be able to see it but that one's pretty
new a lot they had buy one get one fifty
percent off i had to get this the
l'oreal magic decrease eyelid primer if
you've ever seen me get ready and I
whenever I put eyeshadow in the crease
of my eyelid I always say Oh Boone the
crease and it's the magic decrease
eyelid primer I was like yes this one
was made for me like even though it's
not decrease like you know I mean so I
want to try that because I've never
tried an eyelid primer from the
drugstore that I have been in love with
I've had things that I like but not that
I'm in love
with and then next I got some of the new
buck some liquid lipsticks I got two of
them the wildly with lightweight
lightweight liquid lipstick I got nudist
which is a beige buff and then i also
got criminal which is a black violet I
decided whenever i buy lip products when
i get to i get one that's in my comfort
zone and one that's out of my comfort
zone that they don't own the shade so i
got the black violet oh my gosh so i got
a nude one and i got like a bright
purple cuz i don't own any lipsticks
like that i always stay in my comfort
zone so I'm excited to tell you guys all
about those I hope that they're good I
hope so Oh Tanya didn't like the
decrease one oh no bad bad mean Krista
says the Milani eye primer is her
favorite so well it can always go back
to old I can always go back if I don't
like it oh no that's so sad okay so next
up I wanted to show you my support
carcass we've only got four minutes left
almost out of time and i'm going to show
you my support cart of things that i
plan on buying at sephora i don't know
