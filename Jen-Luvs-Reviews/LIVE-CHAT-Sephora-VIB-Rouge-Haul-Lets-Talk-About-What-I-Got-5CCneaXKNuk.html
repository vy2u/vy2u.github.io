currently bleeding a little late coming
on and I said because I was trying to
pull like my I have my my laptop is
sitting here on my chair and I was
pulling my chair back and somehow my toe
got caught underneath my Rollie chair
that I sit on and I was sitting on it
and I ripped about this much skin like
off my big toe so I'm currently bleeding
but we're gonna keep going anyway
because it looks like it's not bleeding
so bad that I need to like do something
about it and right in this moment it's
not hurting horribly but yeah so that
just happened but I do want to do this
hall with you and I have to go pick up
my kids in like 45 minutes so I want to
do this hall so let's just keep going
and pretend like I'm not bleeding let's
do it so if you do not know right now
the Sephora is having their semi-annual
sale it is 20% off everything on their
website with no exclusions that I know
of and I decided to go a little crazy
this year I feel like you know do I need
more makeup no do I want more makeup yes
and do I want to review some very highly
uh you know interesting makeup for you
yes I do
applied to review this support so I'm
opening a box right now I have anyone
open yeah that's been sitting in my
living room for the past few days and I
wanted to open it with you and give you
my true first impressions so I've been
waiting to do this video to do it with
you and I'm not gonna let the fact that
my toe is bleeding stopped me from from
talking to you I am going to dab it a
little bit what is that it's only a
flesh wound
you ever see Monty Python Holy Grail
it's just a flesh wound
that's a terrible British accent all
right okay we're not bleeding as much
now for good we're in a good place
thank it everybody here this joining me
live I appreciate you being here I'm
gonna scroll up real quick and just say
hi to a couple of people superwomen is
here hello and Sharon and girl Tabitha
is here glitter ball hey hey what's up
how are you Linda actually doesn't live
that far from me I've met Linda multiple
times rachel is here in Sharon and pink
lamb girl and I'm excited for you guys
to be here too and Rachel and Neila
I think I said that right Milla and
zenobia is here and Franziska frenzy
Scott is here and suraíh is here hello
everybody and if I didn't say hello to
you hello to you let's get into this
hall okay so what I wanted to do was I
wanted to buy things that I thought
people were the interested in seeing and
also things that I was personally very
curious about so the point of this video
is to get your feedback on what you want
me to review on the channel and what you
want to see more of I was thinking about
bringing back I used to do a series for
a while called just swatches for I I did
it for like older palettes which was a
huge bust they didn't get many views at
all but if I did it for new and current
palettes I think that maybe they would
they be more interesting so I was
thinking about maybe doing some dress
swatches and some of the stuff that I'm
not sure if I'm gonna have time to
review but but our new palettes like for
example the Too Faced holiday palette
the Tarte holiday palette I'm not sure
if I'm gonna be able to get to I also
have the Fenty Beauty palette I have the
etosha tanana Lila palette I've so many
palettes that I've been playing with but
I don't know if I'm gonna get a chance
to do a full review on them so you know
so we'll see Oh Elizabeth wants to know
about this this is IKEA that's where I
got that from okay so keep that in mind
and make sure if you're watching us on
the replay definitely leave your
thoughts in the comments down below and
if I miss your comment over in the live
chat make sure that you come back after
the video renders and leave it as a
comment all right so the first thing I
got was it's all Stephanie Nicole's
fault it's her fault i swatched it at
her house this is the visi art
professional makeup Golden Hour palette
i swatched at her house and i fell in
love with it oh my gosh I'm thinking
about getting the color rain palettes
but they don't have those at Sephora so
I didn't get those but yeah look at this
thing look at the packaging isn't the
packaging gorgeous I mean compared to
what visi art used to be which was
basically just basic plastic not good
packaging they have upgraded like
seriously on this package
as they should for the price of these
things but isn't that beautiful oh my
gosh I'm not gonna swatch it right now
maybe I'll do it just swatches and then
I can always do full reviews later but
oh my gosh okay I can't help but I have
to swatch a couple of them just a couple
oh my gosh can't even so excited
I don't know that this one looks a
little bit it doesn't look as pigmented
as I expected it to be but that doesn't
mean it's not gonna be beautiful on the
eye and then it's not going to build Oh
crystals here from hits crystal hello my
friend if you have if you want to see a
real makeup artist give some great
advice on makeup you need to check out
its crystals see I mean let me try spell
it right
C and C ry s tal it's crystal oh my gosh
so but I've been so digging her channel
lately and Tiffany dawn is here she's
got a great channel Cassie from thrift
thick is here great channel of course oh
my gosh so many of my friends are here
that's so awesome
Cassie says it's so hard this time of
year when all of the new palettes are
coming out being a reviewer online is
overwhelming there's so many pallets we
only got two eyes that is the truth
girlfriend that is the truth wait you
see what else I got them all right let's
go into lips a little bit I decided to
get this from Hooda Beauty I was very
curious I don't own anything by Hoda
beauty I did have a pair of her lashes
that I ended up using too many times and
I they're gone now I don't know where
they are but this is the winter solstice
lip strobe minis they are minis they're
tiny but I wanted to see because I love
iridescent lips I'm a huge fan so let's
do a little smoochie smoochie
okay hmm they smell kind of sweet a
little sugary but not I'm not super
strong and not super fake just a little
bit sugary Oh Gigi says she's got 20%
off tomorrow nice because it's staggered
the the the sale is set is staggered so
I was if I'm a VIP Rouge I'm not sure if
I'm going to be next year or not ooh
okay I'll just swatch them all and then
I'll show you the first one that i
swatched was called the white one is
called star-crossed and then the second
one is a pink one and this one is called
hypnotic and then next this one is
bewitched and this one is purple like a
purpley pink and then the last one is
called I'm going to show you in a second
this one is called charmed and this
one's like a peach so those are the
swatches they're very curious about this
Brenda says I look stunning today Thank
You Brenda I just filmed my prism
palette review just a few minutes ago my
honest Ossie a prism palette review I'm
hoping that'll be I was gonna have it
ready for you tomorrow but I think it's
gonna be Monday because I can't film one
of those and edit in less than 24 hours
those things take me forever to edit so
check out my toe my toe is dripping a
little bit hold on a second let me blot
my toe again hold on if I thought it
wasn't so gross I would show you but
it's gross you don't want to see it
Brenda says she likes the new Fendi
foundation that's cool awesome I still
have my review I'm still working on it I
just I kind of got moved down on a
priority list
are they sticky that's a great question
I will let you know just a little bit
just the tiny bit they don't seem like
they'd be sticky on the lips I may pull
some off my hand and putting on my lips
I already have so much product on my
lips no they're not sticky
that looks really pretty though did you
see what I just did that looks really
really pretty I just I have on the Pat
McGrath lipstick I think its flesh 3 and
then her gloss over top and it bled
everywhere I had to clean it up but but
yeah that actually looks really pretty I
don't know if you can see the little
shine on there so I'm excited to play
with those that's awesome and it wasn't
super expensive so this is the back of
it where it shows you the different
colors so that's cool I'm excited about
this and no it doesn't seem to be
sticking Erica says hydrogen peroxide
will stop the bleeding we'll work on
that after the haul I guess I will try
it
that hurts though doesn't it doesn't it
hurt put your foot up elevate it I'll
just hang I have nothing to put it on so
I'll just hang it up right here okay
fancy Beauty speaking of fancy beauty I
got one the cosmic gloss ice watch this
I was with my friend Nicole from yay or
nay Nicole when we were down in San
Francisco and i swatched this at her
local Sephora and it looked amazing I'm
so loving that gloss and shine and
iridescent sand all of that is coming in
oh my gosh it's so pretty so I'd get it
closer as I tried to put my foot up
smells a little bit stronger than the
hooda ones and still very sweet a little
more fake a little more artificial
smelling but isn't that beautiful I wish
I had more than just my lips on my lips
right now I wish I had multiple lips so
I could squash these on my lips for you
but I am very excited about that it
looks absolutely beautiful and the thing
I love about colored glosses is you can
layer them over lipsticks and have such
a multitude of new shades just by
layering a gloss like that over top of
an existing lipstick that you already
like you know what I mean okay next up
oh and I got another thing from what a
beauty these are so I was expecting that
to be bigger I know I know there's must
be mini pallets but that's pretty tiny I
don't own any hota Beauty eyeshadows so
I figured this was the time to do it I
didn't want to get the full palette so I
just got a small one this is the mauve
obsessions one let me do a little swatch
you have a few of these
oh that's soft lots of dimethicone and
these ooh I can feel it
so those three right there so these
three are the busy art and these three
are the hooter ones hora hooter
stephanie says who de so I mean I don't
know if it's hooter or hooda which one
is it you got to tell me
Frannie says hydrogen peroxide I'll just
clean the wound okay that's good to know
all right let's do this shimmery guy
because I'm curious let's do three more
that one doesn't really they might build
a little bit we'll sing so these guys
right here are all from the hooda so
we'll see we'll see I'm not like oh my
gosh you know like I was with the visi
art over at Stephanie's house but they
seem nice they definitely seem nice all
right so let's
oh here we go I got the many of the for
Solly rose gold elixir I did try out in
the store with Nicole I tried out the
unicorn one and I was not impressed it
just look like a oil I was expecting
unicorn you know expecting like a
magical unicorn s and it was just kind
of boring looking so I want to put this
on the back of my hand so you can see
this and was really really pretty oh
there's like a little seal on it hold on
gonna take the seal off are they all
shimmers
let's see Jenny wants to know if they're
all shimmers hi Jenny no we've got three
shimmers and we've got 3 4 5 6 Matt's in
this one dimethicone do math con just
gives it that's that soft smooth slippy
kind of feel some people don't like to
metha cone in their products yeah it's
the third ingredient talc mica and then
dimethicone I called it I called it it's
not a bad thing for me I like
dimethicone in my products that's just
me but I don't have problems with that
particular ingredient and that's you
know that's just me personally all right
so if you have oily skin I don't know if
this would just make you look like
greaseball or what but I don't know it's
just it's so hyped up I wanted to try it
it gives like a shine and it smells good
Kat says definitely mentioned silicones
and shadows does it cause it to blend
and be muddy I personally haven't had
that experience where they they muddy
because of the cell
of the dimethicone but I don't know
that's just my personal experience
everyone has different experiences
crystal says for the price I want an
actual unicorn to prance out I agree I'm
totally with you crystal
I am with you 0rl I place my order on
Saturday and in Rouge and hasn't shipped
yet aw man I'm sorry to hear that
but you can see it still gives us shine
so I'm just super curious about it and I
definitely didn't want to get a
full-size so we got a small one and then
I've got one more thing for you I did it
I sucked it up and I did it I figure if
I was gonna do it this was the time to
do it look at this look how pretty this
is
so you undo this packaging this is the
Pat McGrath mothership palette and it is
a total of thirteen point two grams of
product which seems like a lot and it's
beautiful
it's absolutely beautiful the the Pat
McGrath packaging before was terrible
but she's really been upping her
packaging like for example if you look
at her lipstick her lipstick is really
beautiful that came out recently but
like look at her lip gloss from one of
her first launches like what are you
kidding me what it would even is that
and I was expensive it's really
expensive my friend Nancy had gotten
these for me but still it's expensive
all right but anyway so this is the
mother ship how you get ten eyes shadows
they are huge pans huge pans we got to
swatch these babies all right let me go
to my other arm here I don't want to
drop me let me check on my toe
okay we've stopped bleeding profusely it
looks like a heartbeat
it's like jagged like this oh my gosh
only me they feel kind of cold it's kind
of weird
I've been really curious about the gold
what that was going to look like
and one of the big reasons why I wanted
to get this as I wanted to know why why
is it so expensive is it really worth it
is it really worth 125 dollars for 10
eyeshadows really really and truly and
right now just from the swatch very very
very baby first impressions I don't know
oh no that gold is weird though it's
different it feels hard like when you
touch it it feels hard okay let's try
the next one this one is a really cool
duochrome what is that that is neat that
is really neat amber wants to know if
the Pat McGrath products are worth it my
experience so far is no brooke says 125
is too much even with 20% off I agree I
did do the the 20% off so I did get a
discount on it and I went from Ebates
which is another two and a half percent
cashback I don't know what cashback is
right now okay we're gonna get the green
on the next one what that's the green
that's the green are you kidding me
that's not green it's happening it's
cool though it's black with the purple
and green sparkles in it that is not
green Julie says yes it's green no it's
not it's not green Julie it's weird but
it's not straight-up green let me put it
on this hand
we put it umm where can I put it that
you'll be able to see it let's put it
right here look it's not green I was
expecting it to be green I mean it is in
certain shifts like if it shifts it's
kind of green it's very complex though
it's definitely cool but it's not always
it's like this is the weirdest thing
this is so weird
this is the weirdest shy shadow of ever
see it is super duochrome all right
let's see Clarabelle wants me to put the
duochrome on top of the black okay we
are gonna do that I need some more space
though let me do a little bit of white
in this off and I do still have one more
shade left to swatch here let's put it
over the black let's do that I think
that's a great idea
it's so weird I've never seen a formula
like that okay let me wipe this force
Ollie off my hand here too okay so we're
gonna do a few swatches of black and
we're gonna put the duo Chrome's over
top so this is just the black and I'm
gonna put the three duo Chrome's there's
three do Chrome's
this one this one in this one and we're
gonna put that over top and see what
happens I have to admit they are cool
you're cool alright so this one what did
I do
I can't remember what I did that's like
it's like rainbow trichrome Macy's this
trichrome I know right those those are
cool they're really neat I wouldn't put
it on my eyes right now how fun are they
oh my gosh okay
well alright let me swatch this one that
I didn't swatch by itself it's that
white one down on the bottom that's it
by itself so that one's a little bit
less interesting it reminds me of
actually from the armed subculture the
one here but done well because the
subculture one was not good hopefully
you can see it so subcultures over here
and then the Pat McGrath is over there
but yeah those are fun those are really
fun okay this is gonna be fun I'm
excited I wish that it was an entire
palette of this formula that would be
super cool but then people would
complain that there weren't any
transition shades and things like that
mmm I don't know we're gonna have to
play with it we're gonna have to play
with it but like this one right
I think that's the green one that is
really cool it's it might be dare I say
hallo no I can't say hallo but I am
getting rainbows I mean I'm getting
everything from red to orange to yellow
to green is that considered holo if you
can get that many colors out of it
Gigi wants no Stephanie bought the Pat
McGrath shadows I don't think so Tiffany
says I'm telling you Pat knows what
she's doing
let's just watch the green one more time
by itself even though it's not dropping
things that too much stuff here no this
is the green right here
what is that dead if that's not the
green what is that that must be this one
the one up in the corner this one up
here must be that one if it's not the
green it is I don't a me tam says nope
not hollow Cassandra says not worth the
price anyways no matter how you use it
I think everyone's got their things man
it's that one it's this one up here the
one that's giving all of those rainbow
colors is this one I mean $125 is stupid
it's stupid to pay that much for
eyeshadow but that is fun even the
mirror is fancy I know right let me take
the little cover off I can get it off I
mean it looks like a diamond stephanie
is douchey she is B yeah I agree
but yeah I mean this this is a Lux this
is a Lux
item but honestly I would rather pay for
this then like a Dior palette or a
jiangshi
you know what I mean like like palettes
at this price point have been around
forever but no none of them are this
cool like you think about you know some
of the like the the Charlotte Tilbury
palettes that stephanie was talking
about those are half the price but you
look how boring they are you know what I
mean and then you look at something like
this you know you can get what are those
like the like the Chanel and the the
Jeeva machine all of that they're all
like relatively boring like this is
interesting so if you're gonna spend
that much like on line something like
that it's
lux I feel like this would be more fun
that's just my opinion though I don't
know some people aren't gonna some
people aren't gonna dig on shadows like
this though so I mean it it all comes
down to personal preference in every
single thing people purchase but having
information behind it is important to
know whether something is gonna meet
your personal preference so but yeah oh
I didn't mention this is this the
mothership to palette by the way I just
so you know it's the second one but
anyway I should probably pop off of here
let's say anything else and what he's
saying before I go Devin says Chanel
shadow formulas are so hit and miss yeah
I've had that same problem I had some
given to me by a friend of mine and I
thought that they were just okay so
that's it that's my whole haul there is
something else in here but I don't know
it says this just smells wait oh it's
probably perfume samples everybody that
went into store got a tote bag I wish
I'd gotten a tote bag that would have
been nice
Oh is Samantha here Samantha March here
she's got a great youtube channel too
yeah they're just perfume samples that's
what's in here cool all right I'm gonna
pop off here I just wanted to show you
was it Samantha
I think it's Samantha March I just
assumed it was Samantha March yeah it is
hi Samantha lots of great chant people
and with great channels in here but um
but anyway I gotta go I'm gonna go pick
up my kids I'm gonna go edit a little
bit and then I pick up my kids tomorrow
we've got a fabfitfun unboxing it is a
sponsored video but the content
definitely does not seem sponsored I'll
tell you that I actually did something
really fun where I i blindfolded myself
and it's a blindfolded unboxing and it
was really fun to film and it was it's
really fun to edit too because it's kind
of laughing at myself the whole time so
I think you're really gonna like it even
though it's an unboxing and unboxings
really aren't always all that
interesting but I think you're gonna
really love this one so make sure you
stay tuned tomorrow to that video I'm
almost done editing it and then the
prism palette review is gonna be up next
Friday and not Friday next Monday is the
plan for that one and then I don't know
what's coming next I have so many
choices of things that I want to do
and want a review oh I want to dig into
the stuff from shop hush that'll
probably be next so thank you guys so so
much for being here I really appreciate
it and mad love to you I'm gonna go put
