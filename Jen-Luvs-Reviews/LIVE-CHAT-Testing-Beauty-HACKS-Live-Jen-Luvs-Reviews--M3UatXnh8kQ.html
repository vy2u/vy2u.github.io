and makeup chat welcome to the later
edition so hopefully there will be some
people here that aren't typically able
to make it when we do the chat early in
the morning that's why we schedule later
chats and this is going to be a really
good one this is gonna be testing beauty
hacks I've had a lot of requests to do
Beauty hack videos and I'm very excited
to be doing one live so we can
experiment together we can play together
and see whether these things actually
work or not or whether they're worth the
effort because sometimes you know even
though it's a beauty hack maybe it's
just not worth the effort maybe it's you
easier just to do something different
then what the hack says so we're gonna
be testing those today I've got some
stuff going on over here I've got my
pair of loves mug that you can't see
because it's on the other side oh it
says hashtag hashtag pair love's and
then it says Jen Lowe's reviews on
periscope and then it's got a bunch of
little hearts going up the side if you
haven't been on periscope you top the
screen to give hearts foggy on periscope
you can be a Perry love to just gonna
download the app or you can go on you
can watch them on the Internet I'm not
quite sure if you can participate on
like a regular computer but you can go
you can even watch them on replay
through the computer I'm not 100% sure
the logistics of all of that but I'm
sure it'd be that hard to figure out
right so anyway enough about periscope I
love me some periscope it's kind of like
this except for it's all the time I'm
gonna go ahead and open up the live chat
also known as the collective brain of
makeup awesomeness also known as the
people that I'm seeing talking over here
on the side of my screen so I'm gonna go
ahead and scroll all the way up to the
top and take a moment to say hello to
the people that are here if you're
watching this on the replay please
excuse while I just connect with the
collective brain for just a moment and
then we'll go ahead and get into our
first Beauty hack so hello to Tabitha
and Steph and Ashley and Janet
indicating one and summer I've had a
good day summer hopefully you've had a
good day too
Tabitha says let us pledge this week the
first time we wait the first we use
timeout and next we block oh okay
because we had an issue with blocking
people
mathaa but it wasn't really an issue was
just a misunderstanding
anyway hello Lorraine and hello jelly
and hello Natalie and Krista hands
let's see anybody else let's see they're
all discussing the issue last week yes
and Tweety and Kelly and Karen and Nicki
and Lindsey and in the world no it's
happening and the collective brain
before we started carrying I think I
already said Karen and Diana and Chelsey
hello and Naomi and Helen hello
everybody I'm gonna go ahead and scroll
all the way down and we'll see I know
there was a Jen comment that I missed it
says serenity Jen just thought I would
throw it out there that is a waste of
money to get the lit cosmetics glitter
glue to use with the mug sparklers
horrible fallout and creasing I tried
multiple times that's great to know I do
I did have the lit glitter I'm not sure
I still have it I got it in my beauty
lish lucky bag last year and I don't
know if I gave it away or if I still
have it but that's good to know that it
doesn't work thank you so much for that
tip much appreciated alright uh and then
Sweet Cheeks says I've never made it to
one of these live chats before so
excited I'm so excited to have you here
and Nicole is here from yay or nay
Nicole on YouTube and we're all right
yes romper room it is very grandpa
Ramesh alright so what I did in order to
find these hacks was I went to I
searched for makeup hacks and the second
the second article on here was from
cosmopolitan calm the first one was kind
of mad so this is called 17
life-changing makeup hacks every woman
sit down there we go so the first one
we're going to do that well I'll tell
you the ones that are on here so the
first one says turn a pencil eyeliner
into a gel formula with the help of a
match or a lighter now I don't have any
eye pencils that I feel like need a
layer or a match in order to soften them
so I skip that one
the second one says cover your eyelid
with a white liner to make any eye
shadow pop and that's one that I think a
lot of us have done before so I wanted
something that I know I've never tried
before but I've done that one before and
it does work the next one says draw your
cat eye first and then fill in the open
space for a perfect winged liner and
that's the way that I do my eyeliner
every day I'll show you what the picture
looks like and I'll scroll up a little
bit and basically drawing the line and
then drawing the triangle and filling it
in Helen says incinerate your eye
pencils all right and then the next one
is the first one we're going to do it
says use a spoon to create the perfect
winged liner that's what we're gonna go
ahead and do first
so it says holding the stem of the spoon
against the outer corner of your eye
draw the straight line as the first step
for your cat eye then flip the spoon so
it's hugging your eyelid then use the
rounded outer edge to create the
perfectly curved wing effect and this is
what it's supposed to look like when
you're done hopefully you guys can see
that all right lzm says I've tried that
with the lighter and then it works yes
if you have an eyeliner that isn't very
creamy yes it does but you Emily don't
want to set your eyeliner on fire that
would be very very bad all right Krista
says Wow so notified me five minutes
into chat fail and I actually put up the
notification about 30 minutes ago so yes
any kitty one Jen says milk eye pencil
by NYX is instead of a white liner yes
and you know I think a lot of us kind of
know that one so Jessie's Girl let me
switch over to the camera view so that I
can see what in the world I'm doing and
I'm gonna make it a little smaller so I
can see the collective brain at the same
time and what I always do is I put my
liner on the top and then I just kind of
pull it up a little bit on the edge just
like that but I don't go like this is
the edge so really it's supposed to be
pointed up that way but I don't
typically do that so we're gonna try
that today mm-hmm and see how it goes
let me get my mirror real quick
essential Indian has these I'm actually
quite nervous to do this I should have
brought I make over over just in case
alright so let's see what happens okay
let's see if I can set this right here
on the edge of my computer take me to
the edge
hopefully he doesn't fall off the edge
okay so this is what we're gonna do so
first we're gonna just kind of draw on I
have no makeup on at all so this is just
on a blank eyeball all right so I'm just
gonna draw on the other eyeliner
okay and you guys can see good okay okay
I'm gonna ever put on eyeliner without
anything on it I think at least in a
really long time just onto my naked eye
okay so now that we've gotten that now
it says you're supposed to take the
spoon like this I'm not supposed to be
where the wing goes so kids won't know
about that maybe that's like be pointy
nope
okay well we're just gonna keep going
with it and then we're supposed to use
the spoon this I got I met someone who
was asking I missed to it was to
disappear too fast but this eyeliner you
can get on Jesse's girl calm so now at
this point what I would probably do if I
wasn't doing the spoon thing is I would
then connect this here like that but
we're doing the spoon thing so let me go
back to the picture and I'm supposed to
hold the spoon like this holy what holy
what okay I'm supposed to hold the spoon
Oh like that and plus II use that as a
guide to color it in oh my goodness what
what is happening here
alright ok well we're gonna straighten
it up a little bit okay
maybe yeah you agree Tricia's like this
is way too complicated
oh I totally agree I totally agree so I
feel like I need to straighten this out
like one thing I do like is it made me
go upward which I don't normally do I
don't know you got to try the other side
now but I feel like it's like like I
need more going down this way and the
problem with doing this hack is that I'm
stuck with this on my own the whole rest
of the chat so it turns out bad out of
luck I know totally Cleopatra panting
mmm pancakes says total Cleopatra yes
way to come yet okay well let's do the
other ID just so that we match because
this would be crazy but I guess I mean I
did kind of like this part because it
made me go upward where I'm not used to
going upward so you know okay all right
well let's go this way let's try the
other side you got two eyes might as
well try it twice right okay
all right so the main eyeliner is on
make sure it's all colored in okay so
now we'll go Edition Virginie says it
looks good don't worry
oh I hope yeah take could do the same
thing upward that's true that's a good
point maybe I should try the next on
another day okay so we're gonna go like
this
but now it's like I feel like maybe I'm
did I like angle it wrong or something
cuz look look at the difference
this one's pointing way up higher than
the other one who knew oh no well let's
see if I can point it hold on wait what
what huh know what I mean my eyebrows
just aren't even alright let's just keep
going
wearing liner for the club scene maybe
alright so now we gotta go like this and
like part of the fun of this is me
looking like a complete idiot uh-oh oh
no my husband's yelling at my kid oh no
it sounds like he's in big trouble I
know you're in big trouble mister
okay okay we definitely need to wing
this up higher well keep going the same
direction I'm supposed to be going out
to dinner after this oh I try to keep it
real well one thing that's weird is it's
giving me this little let me get a
little closer this little dig here
that's really odd you don't really know
how to fix that they see us on both
sides like it's weird all right we're
just gonna keep going a men's summer I
don't know what summer said summer is
awesome I'm gonna definitely have to
like rewind and watch the see what you
guys said
Drive Thru oh we're supposed to be going
into a restaurant later so we'll see
what happens okay um I guess I have to
see what summer said now what did summer
say that was so funny
alright on a second walk like an
Egyptian yeah exactly
so Karen said looks like that was a myth
Diana says I'm reading back some of the
comments so we teach 23 says or you do
you you do or you do and I just had to
wait for that part oh I missed it okay
sometimes I missed part of the
conversation that looks dangerous this
looks not so way too complicated
awkward ition adjust to a wing agreed
hey ray said I would spoon my eyeballs
out
Laramie says way too much lol Trish says
that's a fail summer says I swear Urban
Decay primer under it I definitely feel
okay come on a minute that's off top I'm
trying to find the ones that have to do
with this Lorraine says way too
complicated
I think this hat consumes too much time
I agree
I want to see what summer suddenly finds
summer is coming summer says way too
much work I prefer to learn how to do
things without special tools or anything
because otherwise I won't be able to
replicate if I don't have the tool
that's a really good point really good
point you see if summer said anything
else that I missed she's got a nice
bright rainbow little things it's easy
to say and they she says I think spoons
are better for ice cream than eyeliner
that's the one that's the one I missed
nice gem there summer nice gem okay too
much work we all kind of agree that this
is probably not the best tack all right
I did scroll way up I wanted to find out
what you said all right moving on next
hack next hack all right so the next one
on here says draw a slanted hash tag at
the outer corner of your eye and then
blend it for an instant smokey effect so
there's that one and I feel like you
know yeah I could see that that would
work I could see that that would work I
mean I don't know yeah I mean I guess if
you if you color it in any pattern
though it should work really yeah I
don't know about that one
okay and then it says use that same
spoon to avoid mascara marks on your
upper lid we're gonna do that one in a
minute because we have this ones do
first add saline solution to a flaky
mascara to reword it okay
so we're bringing out the terrible and
awful NARS audacious mascara this was on
the bottom of my favorites and fails
two months ago and I had opened it or
beginning of the month so it's almost
dead so there's hardly anything going on
yet you're supposed to draw hashtags is
that pay race has put hashtags on side I
don't know so we're gonna use this on
one side just the way that it is and
then I brought my saline solution and
we're going to try to put some saline
solution and it's kind of doctor it up
so it did used to be called a pound key
I don't know what happened to that I
guess pound isn't as cute it's hashtag I
don't know this mascara is just junk
doesn't do anything I don't know if it's
flaky but it's definitely not wet it
just basically doesn't do anything so I
don't notice the best mascara for it but
I couldn't think of
one that was better but like that's an
arse mascara narcissus like super
expensive right
like hello what is that I don't even
know okay yeah and it's a huge one it is
and it's very very pokey it's really not
fun to use at all and of course not
about this crazy eyeliner on you can't
even see it at all okay so now that I've
got that on a couple of drips of it says
you're let me just read the directions
just to make sure you're only supposed
to keep mascara for three months because
beyond that point it can collect
bacteria and lead to eye infections
however your mascara dries up within
those three months revive it with a
couple of drops of saline solution so
I'm gonna put a couple of drops the
saline solution in this and see what
happens on a minute this cap always
falls down oh it's not even going in
okay there's one in it's like sliding
down the side there you go there's two
all right okay if you have to read some
ER says um oh indicating one Jen says
Jen hashtags are what artists use for
shading
well that's true that's a really good
point Jen really good point I forgot
about that and I have an artist for a
husband summer says I think you have to
rehydrate the mascara it's time to throw
it out they're basically bacteria heaven
yeah I'm with you Ricky says hi to a
friend from Sydney Australia hi to
Sydney Australia
oh no buffering is no fun Trish says I
do that with my Shanta kaya mascara it's
too expensive I want every drop out of
that thing there you go
oh no buffering I'm sorry alright so
we're gonna go ahead and try this it
definitely seems more wet now see there
so we'll see if it's better okay so here
we go let's try the Sun my crazy
eyeliner you're just tuning in I have
crazy eyeliner oh wow
that actually seems to be applying quite
a bit better I don't think you can see
it but it's definitely wetter oh you
know what I forgot to do the spoon trek
I was gonna do the spoon Trek to make
sure I didn't get any mascara on my
eyelid but I'm pretty good at not
getting mascara on my eyelid I knew all
right so it definitely didn't change
formula at all but it definitely
hydrated it it's still spider ease all
get up but that's due the wand I think
so I don't know if you can see me so I
turn my head to the side and this way I
don't know if you can see it but it's
really just a terrible mascara hi Diana
okay so mmm I can imagine that being a
very useful hack I can imagine that
being good I'm gonna try the whole like
spoon on the eye thing and see if I can
manage that just because I'm curious to
see what I could manage it while we're
here we might as well right but what
definitely made it it's like I just got
some of my finger definitely hydrated it
here we go it's messing with my eyeball
well that actually works hmm there you
go if you happen to have a spoon laying
around well you put your mascara on it
does work I feel like it's flattening my
lashes out though kind of the anti curl
because it's making it so that the
eyelashes can't naturally curl upward so
let me back off on the spoon a little
bit I'm just gonna put it at the top of
the liner and see if I could know its
splatting it out you see what I'm saying
like when I put it here it's making it
so the eyelashes can't curl so like if I
go like this and push it backward yeah
of course
you
you
you
you
okay are we back hopefully we're back
that's what I'm hoping
let's say these technical difficulties
horribly annoying
okay okay I'll we're back
are we back I hope so
the spoon killed the Internet oh my gosh
maybe you are Elsa oh my gosh alright
moving on we're back alright sweet I had
to close out the browser and pop back in
okay so now we're back with my crazy the
eyes that I will never do again like
this and let's go back into let's resume
where we left off okay so we did the
spoon on the eye for the mascara thing
and the verdict on that was that it's
makes the eyelashes flat because there's
nowhere for them to curl to so I
definitely feel like it's effective in
keeping the mascara off the eyelid but
at the same time I don't feel like it
produces a nice effect on the mascara so
no more spoon the spoon but I do like
that on the drops in the mascara I felt
like it definitely rehydrated so I don't
know how that would affect the mascara
over time I mean this is just a one day
rate so yeah so the next one is what
we're not gonna do it says hit your
eyelash curler with a hair dryer to heat
it up so your lashes curl easier so
we're not gonna do that one today I
don't typically curl my lashes they are
not good for me I don't like them so
we're not going to do that um and the
next one says dust on
Lucent powder in between coating mascara
to plump your lashes and I was thinking
about doing that stuff but we'll do a
little bit more anyway we'll do we'll
put a little more mascara on and we'll
see if we can make this mascara better
so I've got mine this is the original
mineral bill by bare minerals brush and
I think what's key to this isn't the
mascara is wet so we're gonna have to go
through the mascara all over again
are you kidding me don't tell me no
sound don't tell me that how's that is
that better oh my goodness no sound
really do we still have sound again on
sound okay fine sound video okay great
okay there's no point doing this if you
guys get in here me this mascara this
island is freaking me out okay so I've
got this brush loaded up with my with my
setting powder and I'm going to put one
more coat just so this is nice and wet
of that now we're going to dab that on
okay no it's definitely sticking it's
definitely adhering out of sync oh my
gosh really okay yeah try to try to
leave and come back if it's not working
alright and now let's put the mascara on
again it's definitely volumizing the
lashes a lot I really like this 100
clumpy clump City Club City but that
might just be this mascara I'd be
curious to try this again with a better
quality mascara but this may be a good
one and get the clumps out know if you
can see the difference and see if I can
get close turn this way
so this is the one with the powder on it
and then this is the one with no powder
but I also put a little extra mascara on
this one without the powder I just
remembered because this was the spoon
eye so let me put we're trying to make
it fair all right let's put a little bit
more without powder on this side because
I feel like I put more on this side on
the other side with the spoon my
eyelashes are gonna hate all right calm
City oh my gosh my scare is horrible
alright anyway alright I do think
looking at it that it volumize my lash a
little bit also clump them together but
this is gonna be a maybe really you see
a blue icon oh my gosh for reals alright
so I'm gonna go like this so this is no
powder and then this is powder I don't
know if you can see I put my head up a
little bit okay Nicole is texting me
your name to Costa I see me okay cool
alright so I don't know I don't know
this just can wait Jordan says oh I'm
happy you're here okay
so anyway okay so this has been this was
supposed to be a really good chat but
I'm having issues so let me just give
you a final verdict on this so final
verdict on using the original mineral
veil from bare minerals on my lashes is
that I do feel like it thickened them a
bit I do feel like they also made extra
clumpy but I don't blame this for it I
blame this terrible mascara so oh I want
to try this more so if you end up trying
this leave a no comment after this video
is rendered leave it in a comment down
below and let me know whether it worked
for you I will definitely be trying it
on periscope so yes
so that one wasn't bad that one was
probably my favorite so far
okay so the next one is about fake
eyelashes we're letting go of the lashes
for say it says apply eyelash glue to
false lashes with the tip of a clean
bobby pin use the tip of a bobby pin to
evenly disperse the glue along the base
of your falsies then wait a few seconds
for the glue to get tacky you can apply
so there you go we're gonna we're not
gonna do that one today but I figured
I'd read it anyway okay for long-lasting
lip color swipe all on your shade lay a
tissue over your mouth and then dust
translucent powder over top to set the
color it will do that I want at the ends
not ready for that one yet Kathy says
you can use a fork for the hashtag trick
cool man
alright this one I think is gonna be fun
this might take a little while to it
says mix loose pigments with a salver
petroleum jelly to make your own custom
lip gloss so we're actually going to do
that we're gonna take a different view
we're going to take a bigger spoon take
this one and we are going to use some
eyeshadows that I don't typically use
these are my blend cosmetics this is
number 69 by glam cosmetics and this is
number 72 this is a pink and then this
is a peach I've also got some raisin
this one is called type A and this one's
called birthday suit these were in my
cluttering
bag so we'll see what happens okay I'm
not putting a fork near my eye no
worries no worries we're gonna use a
spoon so this is how you mix it so I'm
gonna grab first I'm gonna mix three
shades so we're gonna add a little bit
of the pink and I have a plate to put
the song so I don't get nastiness all
over my computer so I'm going to kind of
shake a little bit of this pink into the
spoon okay want mostly pink then I think
I want to try a little bit of this Brown
this is called type-a and I'll show you
how it looks once I get it mixed oh this
one's got glitter in it maybe not maybe
we won't do the glitter no straight
glitter in my lip gloss
I prefer so we're just gonna use a
little bit of this one I know this one
to be pretty yeah it's got some little
finely milled glitter in there but we're
gonna mix that in a little bit of this
brown here see put it up there so you
can see it okay
now I'm gonna mix this up a little bit
and see if we can get a color it looks
like something I would wear no no what
do you think I look like a good lip
gloss color
it'll be nice that's what we're gonna do
okay so now we're gonna take a little
bit of this Tokyo milk dark because this
is one that I just happened to have on
the top and it's very very full this is
in salted caramel and I'm gonna take the
back of this and I'm just gonna dig a
little bit out of the side and scoop it
into the spoon okay okay let me make
sure I'm following these directions okay
it says if you have loose eyeshadow
pigments that you're obsessed with and
want to wear as a lip shade blend it
with a little bit of solve like B VMV
hypoallergenic zooboo balm or petroleum
jelly in a spoon and swipe it on your
lips and voila okay it actually says
boil but I think they meant voila so
I've put show you up close so I've got
that much petroleum jelly and then I'm
gonna mix it in with this eye shadow
brush I'm gonna try to make a lip gloss
at me see if I can show you up close
what's happening here get my face out of
there so you can actually see
it looks more like a lipstick than a
lipgloss at this point I think I have
too much powder we need some more more
jelly more jelly stat all right we're
making lip gloss we're gonna see what
happens don't show this move hey don't
blame the spoon it's not the spoons
fault this really looks very opaque well
of course I like I thought on the powder
was mixed in and apparently it wasn't so
I just got it on my keyboard oh well all
right that's what we're looking like so
far looking pretty good I like the shade
okay so now we're gonna use already like
this it's actually really pretty and
it's hydrating of course it feels good
yes when total win the texture is really
good like that's what it ended up
looking like it looks great it feels
great I'm just watch it on my hand so
you can see how it looks like if we were
gonna swatch it like a lipstick there we
go yeah I love it I'm gonna have to
scoop this into something and save it I
really like that a lot
that's my only issue now is now how do I
keep it that's my big thing how do I
keep it now Christine says how did I
know you were just going to slap it on
your lips Jen of course because I'm low
maintenance
I don't do complicated
all right that's why this eyeliner is
looking so funky that all do complicated
Christine Lee 314 excellent YouTube
channel highly recommend alright let's
see alright so a small pot yes or I can
jump out one of these eyeshadows that I
never use
and I could put the lip gloss in there
so yes maybe I'll make a bunch more of
it and then we'll dump this out
and we'll put it in there but that's
really pretty I really like it I'm
keeping it I'm still keeping this this
is great okay contact lens case oh so
smart Shannon K so smart stick the spoon
in the ziploc bag there you go
why not Shannon I mean you know there
you go it's a great way to use up some
pigments Melissa absolutely this little
jars from the drugstore yes a travel
container yeah cinema secrets are sold
on I don't know since I don't know
anything about cinema secrets little
pots after the bomb is gone yes
absolutely so that's a good one
thumbs up on that one the only thing is
is you have to be careful about things
being lip safe because I know some
eyeshadows are supposedly not lip safe
so I don't know I'm not real stressed
about it to be completely honest I know
and I probably should be stressed about
it but I'm not alright then the next one
is one we probably won't do today I
don't know if we have time we might
perfect your Cupid's bow by drawing an X
on the upper lip first as a guide you
get this little video so she draws that
X then she puts on her lips that's kind
of interesting we might try that I'm
gonna have to take this off though I
know it make me sad okay ah Christine
Lee says she's gonna introduce me to
cinema secrets alright conceal dark
circles and puffy eyes right away by
creating a triangle with your cover-up
and I do that all the time it's pretty
awesome we might do it if you guys want
to see it maybe we'll do that one but
that one definitely works and then
number 15 says make contouring look more
natural by using a pen a pencil pen or
makeup brush handle as you got as your
guide to find exactly where your
cheekbone is I think we've seen that
before and the next one says map the
contours of your face with a gel eye
brow pencil so it's easier to apply
precisely and blend in that one scares
me really scared of that one
anything where your face looks like that
and you have to blend that like that
freaks me out like how do they go from
this to that like I mean this to that
like how does that happen I don't even
know okay and the next one isn't a good
one for me and says blot your face in a
pinch with a clean toilet seat cover you
will not catch me doing that no way dude
okay and that's it for this tip so for
these tips so hmm what should we do
let's say maybe we should do one of
these let's do the triangle eyes and
we'll see the difference we'll do
traditional where you just put it under
the eyes and then we'll put it in a
triangle and see okay and we'll see if
there's any difference okay summer is
just rocking out everybody's reacting to
summer what do you say in now summer all
right so we're gonna do just traditional
on this side and then we're gonna do the
triangle on the other side and we'll see
if we can see any difference so I'm
gonna purposely bring this down like
that this brush by the way is the
tapered refiner by outer beauty
I feel like I need a Beautyblender like
really bad okay and then we're just
going to keep it up here for this one
like it's way too much and um being a
little rough on my undereyes having
trouble blending it okay so there we go
now we're gonna back up a little bit and
kind of look at the difference that the
triangle created versus straight
underneath and I totally agree I like
the way that this looks better and of
course we would put foundation on over
top I do feel like a Beauty Blender or
some cosmetic sponge would be better for
this do you see the difference it just
kind of brightens the whole thing I
really like it a lot
so maybe what we'll do because we have
some time let's put a little foundation
on and see if we can see it well I guess
the foundation might cover it up though
let me get a hold on that I'm thinking
of all these things this is my Beauty
Blender and we can kind of Pat it a
little bit well not a beauty blender
this is from from a collaboration I'm
about to do with my friend Terry Lee
this is from a brand called beauty
junkies but again this is dry it's not
wet cuz I don't want to have to go wet
it but I definitely like the way this
side looks over the other side do you
guys agree they're so funny I'm talking
about pancakes is talking about the
toilet seat cover one and about like
when you flush the toilet like the water
sprays everywhere like I don't want that
on my face it's so totally agreeing with
you
I'm totally agreeing with you oh my gosh
there's all kinds of crazy conversation
how about Cool Ranch Doritos you got if
you can and you're watching this on the
replay and you can join us for a live
chat like so much happens over in the
collective brain that doesn't even make
it on like the show so I highly
recommend dropping by one day but I can
definitely I definitely
like this side better than this side so
that hack I'm really enjoying very much
look even so we'll do the other side
real quick and definitely in the
comments below let me know if you've
tried these and whether they work for
you or not maybe there's something that
I did wrong which I'm definitely guilty
of doing all the time so you can feel
free to tell me if I did something wrong
or if there was a different way to do it
that is better and more effective I'm
very open as long as people are nice I'm
very open I'm gonna do the triangle
again and this is called I went to
Sephora contour in class and they called
this the triangle of light and malli
from Melly Bielek Beauty calls this the
ice-cream cone method just because I
can't not Beauty Blender but my sponge
this comes with the UM the contour brush
set it's $25 for the whole set
I'm gonna have a full review on this at
some point
alright so I'm really really liking this
a lot really liking this this method
makes me happy so there you go setting
powder so I'm crazy another half because
we have so much time we have 20 minutes
left and I got through all my hacks all
right but I really like this a lot it
definitely works this is just that same
finishing powder alright so now let's
try that one okay and the lip one I'm
gonna need a deeper shade in order to do
that we can do the contouring one two so
you're supposed to make it X actually
you know what I could just leave this on
and put it over top
shame so let's go to something to that's
to color pops grunge I love this color
though
okay so we're supposed to do an X like
that no oh no this kind of reminds me of
when you're coloring and you color the
lines first okay maybe I just can't draw
a straight line okay there's my X that
works very nicely actually I'm actually
probably going to use that I really like
that actually I'm surprised at how much
I really like that do the X with the
liner yeah you can do with a lip liner
too I don't have any lip liners that I
can vouch for so you can definitely do
that with a lip liner absolutely so
definitely that one's a win - yeah okay
so we've got 15 minutes left let's read
some things from the collective brain
Christa says I always rip my page when I
color outside the lines that drove
people honkers all she'll says I heard
you can substitute a silicon primer for
the new smashbox product that makes any
lip product matte Rewa
okay so let's look and see if we can do
that it's pretty much the same formula
in my opinion the way that it feels and
looks is the same
the Smashbox actually no it doesn't it's
more I don't know if we're gonna be able
to do that one so yeah X is definitely a
win Diana I really like that I'm
probably for my eyes I'm probably gonna
take it off before I go out and do real
regular I like is there a hack for how
to correct a jack-up link let me show
you what I do to correct a little mini
Bioderma and I just keep this up there
and I do this on periscope all the time
and I take one of these pointy things
and I go like this and then now it's
like perfect for fixing jacked-up liners
so we're gonna try to fix it that's a
good idea let's do it
that's what I do I don't know if this
can be fixed to be completely honest I
think this might be on help this is when
we erased the liner we say goodbye to
the liner that was a lot easier than
having to take it off the only thing now
is now the I don't like the mascara
either but I think I can live with the
mascara but yeah so you can you can use
this to kind of wipe and swipe this way
let me use another one for the other
sides that one's pretty I stopped when
it Laramie say dark smoky eye down there
you go
but yeah usually this works really well
because this this is so messed up it's
like not working there you go see that's
not as bad now see if I gotten the other
side to look like that that actually
doesn't look bad let's see if I can get
it to go up the same way
here we go they match what do you guys
think do you think I can get away with
this spoon half not sponsor yeah I'm
never using a spoon again I think I
would just use tape from now on and not
a spoon I don't know it's not bad
hashtag smokey eye should we do that one
next let's do the hashtag smokey eye all
right here we go so this is a Sephora
waterproof uh-oh we're in trouble
Sephora waterproof and cookie crunch
these are actually really really good
eyeliner pencils if you've never tried a
Sephora eyeliner pencil they're awesome
all right so we're gonna do hashtags so
we're gonna hash tag it over here in the
crease we're gonna hash tag it that way
and then we need a clean really clean
we're gonna kind of try to blend it out
it's not really blending I went with my
finger no this stuff is hardcore that
did not work because this stuff I think
is just too good it goes where you put
it this is what we're gonna do we're
just gonna color it in we're gonna blend
it as quickly as we can that was a fail
but I really think that just because
this eyeshadow this eyeliner is really a
good eyeliner I probably should have
used one it was probably a little more
blendable maybe even a brow pencil
instead I mean it doesn't look terrible
it just doesn't look good you know you
need more blendable product absolutely
absolutely no no no he said no no no I
shadow yeah maybe a softer pencil well
now I'm stuck now I just kind of have to
go for it and do it let's try it on the
other side and see like a blood faster
blam blam blam blam blam blam blam blam
blend and I'm pulling on my I I don't
like that either the how rough I have to
be to blend it that's I worked better
because I worked faster so that's good
to know so if you have like a better
quality doesn't have to be more
expensive but a better quality eyeliner
pencil you draw up in the crease a
little bit more then you want to move
quick
so that doesn't dry on you I don't know
I don't think it looks bad
maybe shadow with a pencil brush maybe
maybe okay
gotta love faces make me put on makeup
oh I know right seriously I don't think
it's bad I think it worked pretty well
yeah let's use a little peanut butter
jelly time on the other side she's a
little bit of this this is called
bananas be hey we're gonna hit the other
side up with some bananas I bet you that
will last all day long - I bet it'll be
super long wearing you get a blending
brush blend them together alright just
blend it a little bit
BAM that actually turned out pretty nice
yeah this is balanced fab man thing's
awesome oh I just got some in my mouth I
just tasted a little peanut butter nice
one
nice woman alright it does you know what
it doesn't smell like peanut butter you
know what it smells like it smells kind
of like um
Reese's pcs especially on this side I
think this side smells more on this side
this side smells a little more cocoa
either side smells a little more Reese's
pcz
but it definitely I don't think I have a
feeling this the smell of this is gonna
fade a lot faster than the other ones so
it's very nice all right so were there
any other ones that we can do oh we
wanted to try the contouring once let me
get a concordant over and we're gonna
use this eyeliner to see if we can
contour so this thing I talked about
this thing all the time this elf contour
palette is so fabulous oh my gosh
if you have not tried this and you're
looking for a good contour and brush and
high-end bronzer and highlighter totally
recommend this one all right so I'm
gonna put this I'm gonna use the deepest
shade down here I'm dropping it and I'm
going to put this at the top of my ear
and then point it toward my mouth and we
are going to contour like that I think
it's just because it's going to cover up
the line so I'm assuming you put it
above because we don't want to put it
way down here you know what I mean we
want it on that line not below it so as
I started to do it I was like no this is
not gonna work like I feel like like
you're gonna have to put the pencil
above you have to like put it there and
then roll it up and then put it below
but then it's like oh no man because it
went way too low no no no more spoons
spoons are done we're done with spoons
for today yeah I'm all spooned out all
right and then we're gonna go on this
side let's see if that works
so if we go like this and then we roll
it up a little bit and then we put it
underneath that kind of works a little
bit kind of
okay and then we're gonna blend it
upward I don't know I think that kind of
worked it just it went too low because
you don't want to go below your lip line
if you can help it
like you want to try to keep it above
the lip line above here no I think it
kind of worked well now what do you all
think in the collective brain you think
about the spoon is it so far-fetched to
face gets all their ideas from the
kitchen that's true and the I felt like
Jerrod Blandino mixing that up that that
lipgloss up because you know that's how
he started oh my goodness look at the
flakiness under my eyes can you guys see
that look Museum in mmm I don't know if
you guys can see that but there's
flakiness all under my eye I don't know
what that came from that might have come
from me trying to take off the the
eyeliner there we go
okay so now we're contoured alright yeah
some of these things definitely don't
seem easier and I think that's kind of
like one of the things that I thought
might happen is that even though it's a
hack even though it's another way to do
it it doesn't necessarily mean that it's
better or easier or there isn't a better
way it's just probably just different
you know what I mean Kristi says I wish
awkwardness led to beauty I would be
flawless that's a good mean you should
make that into a mean all right let's
see if there's any other ones we missed
we have five minutes left for chat so
let's see if we missed any other ones
that we can test so this is the one that
we just did so it doesn't say it
specifically like hold it there it says
not everyone's face is created equal so
we're your BFF might be applying bronzer
might not be the best place for you to
contour oh where she's applying a
bronzer might not be the best place for
you to contour that doesn't make any
sense
to tell you where you should be dusting
on powder a roller pencil or pen or
makeup brush handle right below your
cheekbones elect directly in the pocket
underneath your actual boon to find the
right angle for your face once you've
found the correct placement dust some
bronzer on your face using a contour
brush you're not supposed to put bronzer
as a contour like
bronzer is a bronzer contour is a common
anyway and then diffuse the color so it
looks natural okay there you go all
right I think that's the last one so
what we'll do now since there really
aren't any other ones that we can test
today let's go ahead and open it up to
the collective brain the last four
minutes and we'll talk about whatever
you guys want to talk about so I'm just
gonna read and we'll find some things to
chat about so Snape's honey says if the
peach palate has cocoa powder in it I
will not be able to buy it I don't know
if it will or not I do know that it's
supposed to smell like peaches I know
that this one is supposed to I know this
has cocoa powder in it and then it's
it's supposed to smell like chocolate
peanut butter so I don't know so we'll
have to see lipstick with the tissue in
powder totally works christine lee 314
says maybe we'll try that happens on
that and you know what though i don't
have any tissues in here i can't do it i
can't do it his name's honey says her
husband is allergic to chocolate yeah
that's no good shannon says i saw
something about making a lipstick holder
from a basket thing you can really test
that today you can test that today but
it's cool that sounds neat dan says i
mean don't you just suck in your cheeks
so you can see where the contour is I
think some people with their faces I
think like because mine goes straight
and that's not where I want a contour I
don't want a contour there you know I
mean it doesn't give me that good line
so for me that doesn't work I can
imagine it working for lots of people
Chrissy says they use the chocolate
Soleil for my contour am I getting fired
for that no definitely not no because
sometimes a warm bronzer can really look
good as a contour no no please don't get
me wrong like you should do what you
like and what looks good on you I wasn't
trying to say that people shouldn't use
ever use bronzer for contour but
traditionally from what I've seen I'm
not a makeup artist from what I've seen
and watching too much Wayne Goss and
everything that you that cool cooler
tones are typically used not necessarily
cooler but neutral tones are typically
used for contouring because shadows
don't have a warmth to them but there
are definitely some beautiful looks as
I've seen created with warmer bronzers
as the contour but
having an easier time with it and having
to be more Universal you would use
something a little more neutral to cool
tone as a contour does that make sense
that's from what I've read and what I've
seen this is not professional advice
here Nicole wants to know if anyone's
tried the makeup geek contour and I have
not
Dimitra says do the hacked that draws
lines to make your lips chubbier scared
that one um you mean like over drawing
my lips a little bit so happens well
known about this one let's do this one
we're gonna over draw we got to do it
right there we go this be our last one
here we go
am i looking so far do I look like Manny
M you may go a little bit further maybe
this feels very awkward
is it working do I look like I have
bigger lips did it work or do I look
like I have a mustache I feel like it's
up too high it's weird it's weird I
don't know like I feel like it's not
like there's like a shadow under my nose
and I feel like it brings it to close my
lips too close to my nose I can do that
face that some people are do on
periscope they go like this am i pulling
it off I don't think I am I don't know I
think that's a little too much let's
bring it down a little bit bring it down
a notch for a minute though it didn't
look too bad but I think I brought a
little too high I think it was a little
too much you know but I think Mandy can
pull it off though I do I think he can
pull it off cuz he's cute enough he can
pull it off I don't think I can pull it
off let's bring it down bring it down a
notch all right it's officially 6
o'clock that was really fun that was fun
I really like this shot even though we
had technical difficulties
you
okay I think I got it back oh my gosh
for reals for reals for reals all right
let me see if we're back all right hold
up okay okay there we go
okay I'm back all right I just want to
come back to say goodbye oh my gosh how
annoying I just tried to say goodbye and
then all of a sudden it was like crash
again but anyway I just had to restart
everything it might be my computer I
don't know it might be you too but I
don't know but anyway I think I might
