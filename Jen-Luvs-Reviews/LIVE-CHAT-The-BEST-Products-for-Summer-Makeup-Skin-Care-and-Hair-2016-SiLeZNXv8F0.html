suggestions for you to something you
might like for the summer different

so amanda says hi from Pittsburgh that's
not far from me good to see you in
Pittsburgh actually I can't see you good
to know that you're here in Pittsburgh
hi Maria alright so we're going to go
ahead and start off I think hear me
start off with like skin Carrie kinds of
stuff who know let's start with hair
care because that's totally different
then what else were doing I just have a
couple of things for hair that I wanted
to mention my big problem in the summer
time for hair is my frizz the frizz gets
out of control and the comment that I
hate the most from people that don't
have problems with frizz is you need to
brush your hair alright first of all I
don't need to brush my hair that's not
the problem because if I brush my hair
is going to give me more split ends and
create more frizz I'm gonna have more
issues so it's not that I need to brush
my hair it's I need something to comb
this madness down so one day I recognize
you is the rust elixir miss this has no
hold in it this is really really nice to
spray all over your head and it gives
you a nice shine calms the flyways let
me show you what the Miss looks like
it's just a very calming miss G here
didn't even make a sound it's just this
nice calming miss it has kind of a
beachy kind of set to it anyway a little
bit of a coconutty kind of sad but not
obnoxious just very very light and I
should like very like mist and
very nice and it works really well for
calming of mcfly ways and give me that
shine another product that I really
really like is the cool way glow
finishing oil this is another really
nice product you put a little bit after
you're completely done doing your hair
you pump one pump into your hand rubbing
in start the ends work your way up again
it just kind of keeps the flyaways at
bay these are kind of mine my two
products that I've been using a lot
lately for my hair so those are old ones
that I wanted to tell you but I do want
to go over to the collective brain and
see if there's anything that they want
to tell you about oh my goodness hello
from Bradford West Yorkshire UK hello
hello hi Tina marine since you're
normally mrs. chat but she's glad to
make it here this week and I love you
back Priscilla hello beauty behold are

good oil Elizabeth says she's the
sunscreen for her hair I'm curious to
know what brand you use and alum ice

makes an amazing one so does living
proof very good on beauty holder says so
hobo oil amanda says she's absolutely
loving the new Garnier whole blends in
honey set makes your hair so soft and
shiny I see some Moroccan oil argan oil
lisa says Moroccan oil Tracy says argan
oil let's see reading mom says aveda
smooth infusion line that's claudia
Cheyenne says i love the caviar CC hair
cream for her frizz barber says just
chop it all off that's another option
another option Claire from Char Char
Char in England awesome a little bit of
cooked up papa let's see Renee says
redken frizz dismiss Natalie said Sophia
vo5 biosilk for Felicia and Julie says I
love some john frieda frizz-ease i have
a lot of
with john frieda frizz-ease that stuff
didn't do anything for me so it's really
good that it does something for you i'm
glad Kathy Murphy says easy on the hair
chai nourish intense I've heard the
things about that Kaylee says sun block
all right let's go ahead and move into
the skin care to let me know skincare
wise is you guys know I love my polish
choice but there is a warning on
polished choice which I really
appreciate but I don't know if it's on
every single skincare product so I did
want to let you know glycolic acid if
you have any day skin treatments that
you use to have got glycolic acid you
have to make sure you put on a sun block
because it makes your skin more
susceptible to sun damage so just wanted
to mention that to you and it does
mention that on the polish twist product
and i wasn't sure if every product says
that on there so i just wanted to
mention that while we're here for
sunblock for me of course you're going
to the beach sometimes I wear makeup
sometimes that I don't for the most part
I don't enough she's a regular sunscreen
on my face but i do want to mention the
CCPD creams that i'm loving the most
right now because they do have SPF in
them give you a little bit of coverage
and and they're very nice this blue is
the Barnier one i love this one i use
the combination to oily skin one this is
a fantastic product this one isn't a
shade light to medium really really like
this this has been a favor of mine for a
very long time love this formula another
one is the it cosmetics your skin but
better CC plus color correcting full
coverage cream plus anti-aging hydrating
serum this is SPF 50 plus UVA UVB
broad-spectrum physical sunscreen
chemical filter free paraben free holy
moly did I get through that whole thing
goodness alright but anyway this nice
this nice stuff that's what what tell
you about it is this nice stuff a new
discovery point I got this I've talked
about this a couple of times I believe
in chat this one is the radiant skin c
CC cream broad-spectrum SPF 45 PA plus
plus plus if the brand is Cle and i did
hear that some people were able to find
this online creative last aesthetic is
the name of the
and I have a shade light I am so in love
with this stuff the coverage is so
beautiful I mean it's still going to
give you a light to medium coverage it's
not going to give you a lot i would say
that these two are probably equal as far
as coverage this one's going to give you
a little bit less but not too much less
but as far as the finish I actually like
this one the best as far as the finish
and the way it makes my skin looks so
just wanted to mention those to you and
I'm going to go ahead over to the
collective brain or some suggestions on
am I going way too fast I feel like
we're going way too fast and I don't
have coffee and I don't have water I
need to calm it down I need to harness
my Chi for just a moment bring it down
girlfriend just really all right so
anyway that's not to see what you guys
think about the BB cream CC cream
situation I did see a I know I forgot my
coffee Lauren um correct krista says it
Craig it's CC cream is a holy grail for
her I also saw a couple other people
saying that Cathy Murphy says the
Neutrogena ultra sheer dry touch
sunscreen SPF 55 is her favorite
Elizabeth says the vitamin C will boost
your SPF effectiveness that is very nice
to know mess fantastic snakes honey says
the only problem I have with sunscreen
foundation BB CC cream is a white flash
back in pics I am as pale as it is with
flash back I look like Casper I guess
it's one of those trade oh if you're
gonna have your you can't have your
sunscreen and your no flash face too I
guess Natalie's like Oh Diana says I
hope that cosmetics comes to sephora in
Canada I hope so too alexandria says she
loves the Maybelline BB cream and then
Angie says Jen what cream would you
recommend for extremely dry skin in the
summer what I would recommend is doing
us a hydrating sunscreen first and then
putting your your watch call your
foundation whatever over it because I
honestly feel like for me I do not have
dry skin but for me personally I don't
feel like these are particularly
darating I don't I don't know I when I
think something it's hydrating I feel
something I really feel that moisture on
my skin and I don't I don't feel that
with any of those products I'm going to
consult the collective brain on this as
far as a hydrating product with SPF
terry Lee says Physicians Formula super
CC cream SPF 30 and Lauren says i love
the mission perfect cover so much yellow
bananas rule says what is your favorite
makeup brand for summer I don't think
that there's any brands that we could
say is my favorite one for summer
because every brand kind of has their
individual products and I don't think
there's a brand that specifically caters
to summer you know what I'm saying so I
don't know if that's really something
that oh no I don't know if I can answer
that too well I'm Elizabeth says
supergoop has a sunscreen oil might be
good for dry skin and then amanda says
does a gardenia BB cream hold for oily
skin hold up well in the summer heat I
know that it holds up well in my normal
skin because I use it for a couple of
years now but I don't know about oily
skin Ali says I like the tart tinted
moisturizer Natalie says helps her with
her dry skin which product was that
Natalie I missed it Ferris says the
Smashbox I save Sonny says I sweat
everything off um let's see let me see
ok Lauren says creams are usually a more
popular choice in the summer as far as
longevity and stuff that's all I need is
the ud setting spray but I honestly
don't do many full faces during the
summer and beauty holder says dry skin i
use a moisturizer first at a hydrating
SPF then a foundation so that is a
process girlfriend that's a process oh
the tart as in the summer brand natalie
says that's her favorite and then Ali
says it cosmetics is an ult is on alta
on their website to not just QVC yes
that is true but it is coming to some
sephora the u.s. sephora is pretty crazy
right um alright so Natalie wants to
know how well Dupree into powders tend
to perform in the summer I have not
tried a cream to powder in the summer
yet i just discovered those this winter
so i will be finding out same Sonny
wants to know are there any sunscreen
that don't clog pores and i really like
i hate not knowing the answer these
questions but i don't have problems with
clogged pores so I
issues like explaining like and saying
that cuz I'm a personal experience
Florrie says has anyone tried the SPF
setting spray that was in a sephora play
i have not tried it yet I don't like
setting sprays I don't like spraying
stuff on my face it feels yucky to me I
don't like it I don't like the way it
feels um Julie wants to know also we
Julie will also 10 has anyone tried the
new it cosmetics bye-bye foundation
moisturizer I have not one more skincare
thing and I want to talk to that I
discovered this in an influencer box
last year this is the Vaseline intensive
scare spray moisturizer a low suit this
stuff is so stinkin fabulous oh my gosh
non-greasy totally amazing like I got
sunburn on my legs because I neglected
my legs one day and this stuff saved me
it feels so good undamaged like if you
actually get a sunburn I highly
recommend this one this is one you want
a screen capture this is one you want to
write down and I'm telling you if you
end up in that situation this stuff is
so super fast oh and speaking about it
didn't want to tell you about it ran the
Key West aloe is a brand speaking of
aloe is a brand that I really enjoy I
had mentioned their stuff in a video
once I think they put stuff in a
subscription box or something and I
meant it was the cleanser I tried it in
a subscription box in Key West a load
watched the video and set me a full size
of the cleanser and also a a face mask
so this was sent to me for review but I
do genuinely really love their products
the Key West allo um it's thirty percent
ello so I have not tried this on
sunburned skin or any of that but I
would imagine because a low is such a
high ingredient on here that this would
be a great line to have in the
summertime but that is just my
assumption since number one ingredient
is water and the second ingredient is a
low this is just a really wonderful
cleanser it feels really good takes my
makeup off not my eye makeup because I
don't put it on my eyes but my face make
it makeup it takes you off really really
well so as a brand I just enjoy the
sprint so I wanted to mention it so next
step is going to be a makeup products
how we doing on time 515 before we go to
makeup products I just want to check and
see if there's anything else in the
to brain to mention was that Kimberly
says I love to us a low and let's see
Ali says caffeine likes it a video on
the it CC cream versus it bye-bye
foundation what did she think tabatha
says the best sunscreen is from
colorescience from both from both with
makeup or bare skin ok and then Ali says
i love aloe vera gel for pretty much
everything Tracy says love plain aloe
vera it's an absolute Duke for the
Anastasia brow gel if you put in an
empty mascara container what no way i
bet you it's crunchy though I don't like
the crunchiness zone like that stop see
a brown jealousy crunchy but that's
really cool that's great to know for
like cheap it's a good brown gel that's
awesome I mean you can get those little
disposable mascara wands and just stick
it in your aloe there's bull poop you're
good to go that's awesome very cool
Farrah says what do you prefer powder
foundation or liquid foundation I prefer
liquid foundation personally because I
feel like um with liquid foundation I
feel like I get better coverage than
powder foundation I use powder
foundation as like a supplemental like
if I don't have enough coverage of pro
powder foundation on top to give me a
little bit more coverage right now I'm
just wearing powder foundation it's good
for fast I like powder foundation
because you don't have to worry about
putting a powder over top of it you know
i mean it saves you a step so when i was
trying to get ready fast i use the mary
kay powder foundation and i really like
it a lot it doesn't have any asked piaf
in it though and i'd be scared of a
powder SPF like for me like I don't know
I just feel like I need some kind of
lotion you thing for something with SPF
I don't know I don't know alright so
let's go ahead and get into makeup
products but feel free to keep talking
on the collective brain about whatever
you want to talk about and if I miss
something collective brain people in the
chat definitely make sure you can keep
putting it in and see if I see it
because i can't read everything in the
checks i'm like hung all over the place
one thing i wanted to specifically talk
about about mega products is blush
because i feel like blush can really
make a difference when you haven't been
out in the Sun or if you are using a lot
of SPF and not getting a lot of Sun
blush can really give you that healthy
glow
and I feel like in the summer there's
that judging thing that happens like at
least in my mind because I grew up with
a grandmother who was like you need to
get in the Sun you're so pale you know
and we would like oil ourselves up with
baby oil to try to get a tan and then we
would take a shower in cold water to try
to increase our tan I mean it was bad it
was bad you know in the 80s so I have
this thing where I need to have some
kind of color in the summertime but at
the same time I want to use my ass
because I'm not trying to get skin
cancer you know saying so uh I thought
blush is something that can really make
a difference in your complexion but you
don't want your blush to wear off so
first what I want to talk about is the
cargo swimmable blush this is a water
resistance of blush I have the shadeless
cabos it is their most famous shade the
most popular shade and it's really
really beautiful I honestly cannot tell
you that this works really well that
this is waterproof but I was hoping
someone in the collective brain has
actually tried it but um really really
like just the formula in general I feel
like it's a very long wearing qari this
is probably my favorite really the only
product i can say i love from cargo is
the blush I do have one eye shadow
palette that I like but it's an older
one I have a couple of newer products
from cargo that I don't like it all but
these blushes seem to be consistently
good so I really really really like this
this blush a lot another recommendation
would be to use cream blushes and i want
to show you two of my favorite cream
blushes the bobbi brown cream blush is a
really really nice formula this one is
in the shape blush rose of course this
isn't a very summery shade but I feel
like cream blushes tend to last longer
on me in the heat then powder blushes so
that's a suggestion one thing you can do
is you can put on a little bit of cream
blush throw your foundation over top
then give you another pat of cream blush
I feel like that double duty really
helps a lot and then put the powder on
over top and I feel like that really
works well so the body brown forever HD
this one is a little bit more of a
celery color this one's like a
correlation this is shape 225 I don't
think they have other names but if the
second skin cream blush
another really really nice formula one
more powder blush I wanted to recommend
the bombs in stained blushes really any
of the bombs blushes are really really
long wearing even in the heat so this is
definitely another recommend for formula
44 blushes you know so i'm going to i
won't take the polls again go back over
to the collective brain and see if
there's any other suggestions for
blushes i'm looking at the table to see
what else i have to talk about cuz i'm
gonna run out of things again let's see
snakes honey says charts Park Avenue
princess I got an Ipsy bag says it's
waterproof and I have not tested that
either Christmas as the Beauty Blender
blusher is really good for color pop
blushes that is great to know great to
know Clown cheeks oh yeah Haley says I
stopped wearing a lot of blush since I
never know how to apply it but now I'm
thinking about getting back into it for
the summer and if you're having trouble
applying blush even though I've just
gotten some recent critiques on how I
apply my blush and I can handle that if
you're you're having trouble you're not
sure definitely stick I in my opinion I
feel like sticking to the sides and not
the front is a way of kind of avoiding
that clown face look I noticed
emilynoel83 really applies it to the
front and blends backward but I really
like to apply it to the back and blend
forward that's just me personally I do
the same thing with my contour I do the
same thing with my highlight I don't
know why I just feel no highlight I tend
to go forward two back but um but less
is better if you're not sure I feel like
you know the last you apply is probably
better than the them more and keeping it
to the back instead of right right on
the front and let me look okay um Alma
says those finger three fingers from
your nose and then apply the blush so
right here right there I am right there
but I've seen people apply it to the
front too so I don't know the makeup mom
says yes Jen that's true and Michelle
says anyone have suggestions for burns
girl flared up and got me in the leg oh
my gosh burns alo girlfriend hallo not
cold water do not ever put cold water on
a burn it will actually increase the
bird I don't know what the chemistry is
behind it but if you google
it Google will tell you you never put
cold water on a burn if you have to
rinse burn try to put it in a room
temperature water not warm water because
I'll hurt like a mom but you must but
it's better to just keep it out of any
kind of water al oh definitely a low
this stuff girlfriend oh my gosh it's so
amazing and it's not expensive either
it's vaseline brand it's so so bad and
so easy to apply because sometimes if
your burn you do not want to touch
yourself because it hurts to touch it so
you just spray this on home straight on
real gently so it's got a really nice
spray to it and you can just leave it
like that or you can gently rub it in
and it's just so sting and cooling like
I just got a chill because I'm feeling a
little cold now it's warm in here got a
light on but it was like a little chilly
now good it's really nice it's really
nice alo super fab sarah says Emily
she's not a big fan the way Emily puts
on blush I think it looks beautiful on
her but um you know uh okay ghastly I'm
sorry I'm trying to read the comments
and see if I missing anything don't put
cold compress Michelle don't put a cold
compress on your burro and that's why it
still hurts take the cold compress off
tone cool comrades it no don't do it
don't do it alright is anyway cuz you're
increasing the level of the burn don't
do it don't do it okay so anyway Oh
aquaphor Elizabeth says get a burn spray
from the drugstore and then numb it with
then it will number and then aquaphor
Kenisha says i love mac waterproof
foundation but silver for estee lauder
at last just as long okay Barbara says
Lord Geller says lightly on the front
chic and back back and then up around
the V of your eyes yeah I just not right
here right here you know what blush
right there that's creepy it spent on
your face truckers try different ways
care and says I totally agree yep there
you go Michelle do it girl and tell me
how it tell me if it gets any better
okay alright so the next product that I
want to talk to you guys now I'm running
through these things wait you found
someone 525 I'll have that much stuff
left our eye shadow I am a huge fan of
one
done I shadows in the summertime because
you're busy yet stuff to do you know if
you got kids you're trying it on the
pool when we try and take care when
because they're not in school you know
you it's too much going on one and done
so today just to come give you a little
show of that i use my naked cosmetics
sierra nevada number two pigment I wish
these things weren't so stinking
expensive because they're pretty amazing
they last for ever on the eyes at the
end of the day whenever I use the naked
cosmetics it looks exactly the stinkin
same as when I put it on the morning
like maybe a five percent fade like I'm
not even exaggerating I mean this stuff
is so stinkin good for lasting power and
I just put that all over my lid today
give me a little bit of a sparkle but I
bought two sacks and I'm ads and I do
not regret it at all I only I regret is
not buying more of them because I'm so
impressed with this brand for eyeshadow
you definitely want to use eyeshadow
primer I feel like I shadow primer makes
a huge difference and eye shadow of
longevity not the creasing can really
really happen in the summer because of
the wheels in your skin so using an
eyeshadow primer the Milani one is very
good the elf one is pretty good actually
I really love my Urban Decay primer
potion in Eden I love my mac paint pot
and painterly those are some of my
absolute favorite eye primers on the elf
smudge pots I see Karen saying
absolutely yes definitely Julie says a
smudge pot or a color tattoo definitely
and then beauty living cavalier i'm not
sure what the question is referring to
or else i'd answer it beauty beholder
says love cream or gel shadows color pop
is a great option yes that's true very
good and then I and my video that went
live today my what to my face video I
talked about the difficulty of applying
color pop I shadows and quite a few
people were saying definitely using a
sponge applicator with the color pop I
shadows is a good way to go and that's
not a place that I've really gone much
so I really need to invest invest in a
few sponge applicators like it's going
to cost me a lot of money to use for my
color pop so I haven't really done a
whole lot of that so I'm excited I'm
excited to try that a true beauty also
votes for the color tattoos and
Katherine says the Milani eye primer and
color tattoo crayons I think she has

on flat on flat iron are surprisingly
good and much cheaper if you order from
korea yes I've heard that about both
Dino platts and tony moly to try to
order them not from a US based store and
they're ridiculously cheaper like their
drugstore brands over there sound like
25 hours for a lip balm over it a
Sephora it's craziness so um yeah amanda
says emily noels the reason I got into
makeup you know she's the one that kind
of kept me in makeup it was actually
more Elena from makeup geek that really
got me into makeup but then Emily Noel
followed soon after that I she's like my
youtube idols so uh yes we're all like
filling like all up on the el nino el
business I why doesn't that girl have a
million subscribers why is that I don't
understand why all these people have a
million subscribers and Emily does not

Mount Mally shadow six last forever Tina
Marie loves those fabulous fabulous
actually says emily Noel was my gateway
drug oh my gosh oh my gosh I would just
want to spend just an hour in her makeup
room just like looking at everything it
was like oh alright anyway back to
waterproof nigga back time ago but we
have with a lot I don't have that much
stuff left to tell you alright let's
have an eyeliner eyeliner
recommendations eyeliner recommendations
sephora eyeliners are really real
really really good I love these these
are great in the water line no one ever
talks about them they're super fab if
you saw the green on my eyes today on my
lower lashline today and what's up and
make up that green was a Sephora liner
these things are so awesome my husband
when he was playing around with makeup
for a little while my husband's an
artist he was buying to make up here and
there for a while long story I won't go
all into that but he bought a big set of
these support liners and I'm so grateful
because now that doesn't do any of that
now I get to keep them and I'm so
thankful because these things are so fab
definitely better than urban decay like
like heart and soul into these yes
better than urban decay the Urban Decay
ones for me fall down my water I may end
up smudging down here the lasting power
for Urban Decay ones are not nearly as
good I know Felicia hands up absolutely
to these things they're so so so
stinking good and especially the one
that the Urban Decay one that lasted the
worst on me was the one that was like
black what was it the one that was
supposed to be like a like a satiny kind
of one what was that one called there
was a black one yes even in the
waterline Natalie even in the water like
a more what that one was now I can't
remember but um but yeah I mean the
Urban Decay ones are not great for me
they go on the same but the lasting
power is much much better with these I
Nicholas says essence long-lasting gel
liners are good fabulous not 0 Lauren it
was one it was like ah like black velvet
or something I want to say it was like
velvet something about velvet another
eyeliner if you happen to know not oil
slick something velvet I don't know if
they sell it anymore now that I'm
thinking about it um Oh always says it
makes this is that you don't have a
million subs all thank you and Lauren
says Urban Decay isn't bad 24 is just
better you know i like i like the Urban
Decay one's for my upper lash line
whenever I've used a pencil for my upper
lash line but I do not like them on my
lower lash line they fall down the 24 7
24 7 yes black velvet is that one sherry
yes okay there you go okay all right I'm
I got struck alright so the one that
also another one I want to talk about is
a brand called Noir and I've talked
about this one quite a few times
recently so I apologize if you've heard
this a bunch of times but I got this off
the birchbox shop so if you have
Birchbox points and you're looking for a
really good lower lashline waterline
pencil definitely recommend them to our
brand this is their black black one it's
called forever new r and this one's
really really good to this is my
favorite black eyeliner for colors well
even the black one for Sephora is good
but I like the color selection better
for the Sephora than the new are but and
more is really good too especially we
have those parts box points girlfriend
all right any other suggestions before
we go let's see saves honey lorac ink
liner is waterproof is it really I did
not know that black velvet is that what
it was okay Natalie says weirdly I'm
pretty fond of the Avon liners very cool
very cool lisa says this for liner and
lorac dry out on you so fast relief I
had these things for like I don't know
when to John have that beauty channel
like a year and a half two years ago and
this stuff is like creamy creamy
amazingness I don't know maybe it's your
climate or something because you know
everybody's climate is a little bit
different so maybe you live in a drier
climate than I do which might make them
I don't know I'm Ali says the Rimmel
scandaleyes are the best have trouble
with the rim of falling on me too I
don't know why true beauty says the same
thing about the Rimmel scandaleyes I
have so much trouble with those not
traveling down my face during the day ed
says expensive but Marc Jacobs is her
favorite Lauren says the forest afford
ones don't dry out on her either maybe
it's a climate thing I don't know Sammy
says hello everyone been m.i.a for the
live chat for a while so glad to have
you back Sammy and living like Julie
says rimmel's great for her too so maybe
it's just me on the rim oh I'm I have
trouble with it I children alright
moving on the lips no not moving on the
lips before the 12 lips mascara we have
to talk about mascara Fuhrman but this
is my issue in that I make a habit of
never using waterproof mascara because I
hate I hate trying to get it off there
is something about try and get water
proof vest
off my eyes it makes me so upset it's
the rubbing and the scrubbing of the
waterproof I cannot stand it so i do not
own a single waterproof mascara that
i've tried recently i do have a better
than sex waterproof mascara but i have
not tried it yet actually no that's not
true i did try the pure waterproof

a place that you want to be I'm glad
that you at least got a mascara test out
of it I'm so sorry let's see also
raincoat is the bomb Alma says Lauren
says l'oreal voluminous waterproof
amanda says i use grapeseed oil to
remove yani says clarins double fix
mascara okay it's a primer but whatever
i use it and it never smudges Tracy says
L'Oreal is the only brand that isn't
lying when they say waterproof shannon
says covergirl 2 and won the Super Size
way better than high-end and Catherine
says she doesn't use waterproof mascara
Oh better than sex waterproof Mary Kay
waterproof from candy and then Kathy
says always prefer tubing mascara in the
summer next best thing to waterproof
which I don't wear so I want to try the
waterproofed top coats yeah I really
have been liking them I like the blank
waterproofing mascara I want to try more
of them Elizabeth says lights camera
splashes from Tarte Cathy says taste is
good hopefully taste is a brand and not
something you're doing to your mascara
Charlene said I use super sizer
waterproof and it's good in the heat
nice nice Patricia says I take mine off
with purity from philosophy beauty
beholder Maybelline full and soft
Natalie says Kiko mascara with lash
primer and it doesn't shift another vote
for lights camera splashes from Tiffany
dawn Florrie says Maybelline volume
Express colossal lots of good ones lots
of good ones dizzy Lizzy says Max Factor
masterpiece Max and essence reloaded the
silver one are the
lisa says get the splash is not the
lashes on the lights camera splashes hi
Amy Cheyenne says I use eyelash primer
under my normal mascara all right super
sizer is great from Chris tubing mascara
is a mascara that the way that is
removed is with hot water or very very
very warm water and then the tubes kind
of fall off like it kind of flakes off
but it does not come off unless you use
warm water makeup remover does not take
it off whales do not take it off the
only thing that takes it off is very
warm water Jenna definitely wants me to
see this one Maybelline lash sensational
full fan effect favorite mascara of all
time and I have used all I do love and
lash sensational full fan of fact that
is a good one I haven't used it in he
yet though so I can't vouch for it there
but it is a fabulous mascara alycia says
I've been finding my blush with my
Beauty Blender that's a great idea
alright let's go ahead and move on to
lips now I only have one lip product to
recommend to you right now I'm not as
big of a lip person and the lip products
that i tend to use tend to fade but i
want to tell you i use this the other
day this is colored pops solo i use this
the other day and i'm telling you i put
this on and i use it with a lip balm
lasted for stinking ever i ate pizza
like greasy pizza and this stuff barely
faded i would say after about six hours
it was starting to get to the point
where you had to kind of look at it and
be like is it still on there but it
lasted through the pizza I couldn't
believe it and it looked good but the
important part for me was using it with
the lip balm so that it faded a lot more
evenly so that's my Lauren says no I
want pizza but i'm telling you i really
really like this now i have not found
that with all of the colour-pop liquid
lipsticks I feel like some of the darker
ones the brighter ones tend to fade a
lot more ugly a lot more patchy a lot
more flaky but this one in particular on
sola i was really impressed with it i'm
going to keep my eye out for the other
color pop liquid lipsticks to see if
they excuse me if they have the same
thing christa says i prefer the
colour-pop ultra satin so much less
drying
even if it does transfer Katherine wants
to know some good drugstore liquid
lipsticks I haven't found any that I
truly truly truly love which is very sad
with the drugstore this instructional
price is just not at the drugstore um
but that was what I wanted to say about
that so color recommend our brand
recommendations formula recommendations
for keeping lipstick on in the summer
heats everybody's all about the pizza
now nigga mom says she likes the matte
lipsticks from colour-pop Garcia says do
you put on the bomb on over top or
underneath and what I typically do is
I'll put it on underneath I'll wipe off
the excess put it on over top and then
if I feel uncomfortable at any point or
if I feel like it's not fading well I'll
put it on over top I'll just keep the
lip balm in my pocket and apply it
occasionally so that day I probably
apply the lip balm maybe three times
through the day but really was very nice
does it make my lips dry yes oh yes
please make my lips dry that's why I
have a lip balm now the lip balm fixes
everything it does kind of mess with the
matte finish a little bit here I just
want my lips to look like they've got
some color so you know um cyr says I
Anasazi illiquid lips better than color
palette I have not tried any of the
newer honest asya liquid lipsticks I did
have some of the older formula
unfortunately those were the ones that I
had bought and they're very expensive so
I haven't bought any the new ones but i
can tell you i absolutely hated the old
formula it was it was flaky and try and
horrible so anyone know what lip balm i
use girlfriend i got a whole bag of
lemons that don't even know i think that
one was badger brand it's like a natural
i wish i had i think it might even still
be in my jeans pocket cuz you know
everyone so much leave it in there you
know i don't know i'm pretty sure it was
bad your brand it was like a i think
it's a coconut oil-based if i remember
right now I feel like I need to look it
up we look it up real quick badger I
want to see what the ingredients are ah
ingredients
really never cocoa powder cocoa butter
it says certified organic lip balm from
Bajor classic lip balm contains organic
extra virgin olive oil and beeswax as
well as organic aloe sea buckthorn and
rosehip extracts so i think i use the
vanilla one yes the vanilla one was the
1i used that particular today sandy act
by benefit tiffany says that's an
excellent suggestion beauty beholder
says I prefer lipsticks because it works
better and feels better reading mom says
in the summer of the agave lip mask just
be careful if you're sensitive to
lanolin sheep's wool anything like that
you do not want to use the bite beauty
lip mask but I do love that stuff Hilda
says kat von d a-- really good makeup
monsters too but they do feel drying in
her opinion Cyr says she loves her Kat
Von D liquid lipsticks corsa says my
favorite lip balm is from soda on
company they have sent like cocoa mint
pink lemonade and orange amanda says the
amount of lip products that that end in
a jar by the laundry is scary i know
sometimes i forget to i'm totally with
you i'm sure he says i use them while
i'm doing my makeup and they don't know
what that means i miss what product you
were using sherry I'm sorry Lauren says
yes yes on profa collapse and those are
really really right those are the ribble
ones these are apocalypse I have lip
lacquer and I've lip velvet maybe these
are not it aziza i think they were
called provocative sin in the UK these
ones we're talking about i think Milani
lip treatment oils alison wants to know
what's a good eyelash curler that
doesn't crimp lashes I'll use an eyelash
curler girlfriend those things freak me
out but I don't like this this formula
very much it's kind of one of those
crappy ones i don't really like it yani
says she likes the NARS ones these are
the apocalypse okay alright thanks
Lauren Tina says provocative are the
dual ended one's got it thanks Team
marais see you guys I can't know
everything I just can't when will show
the show officer the provocative gotcha
sherry says she loves the heart eyelash
curler so you know
you wanted an answer to that question
all right so let's go ahead and let's
talk about nails for a second I do have
some nail products what product that I
have found that I cannot live without
which I will be repurchasing there
assume because I feel like half a bottle
is not enough this is called dry ice
it's by color club it's a rapid nail
lacquer dryer so what I do is I paint my
nails I put my top coat on and by the
time I'll start here I'll put my top
coat on me any evening and then by the
time I'm done with this nail I'll take
this and I'll drop this it's got a
little dropper and you know you suck up
the product you drip it on your nails
and what I do is what I I kind of hold
my hand up like this and I'd rip it down
my nail like that and then it drips down
on to the entire nail this stuff is so
super Fab Four quick-drying nail polish
and the sometime we don't have time to
sit around wait for our nail polish to
dry we got stuff to do so I wanted to
recommend this once you I know there's
other brands of quick-drying nail nail
stuff but this is the only one I can
vouch for so so so good amazing amazing
product I definitely need to repurchase
this it's fo acetate butyl acetate
cyclomethicone and dimethicone are the
only ingredients in this so you have to
just wake your top coat to dry for like
a minute but by the time I've done
putting my top corner all my nails it's
been like a minute so but I wanted to
recommend that because that's super fab
another thing I wanted to recommend for
nail polish is just julep nail polishes
in general I mentioned this today also
in my what's in my face video about
julep nail polishes what I'm wearing
today is the shade Soleil and jeweled
nail polishes overall or my absolute
favorite because they are the most
consistently awesome this will go for me
this will probably go three days without
a chip which is a lot for me and I won't
have to take this off for about five to
six days like it'll get little tiny
chips but I don't care about little ones
as long as it's not looking crazy it'll
be five to six days before I have to
redo my nail polish when I wear juleps
and that's consistent most of the
polishes i would say about three to five
percent of my julep polishes are ones
that just don't work as well but it's
very rare and it's some of their
formulas that I feel like don't last as
long like I really like the satin finish
ones but the satin finish ones they tend
to chip a little faster on me but I
really like it so Lauren this one is
called Soleil it's the one I'm wearing
on my nails today what's good for
cuticles I'll show you what I use for
cuticles I'm a huge julep person where
is it okay so for my cuticles what I do
this is the julep vanished cuticle
softener and remover I use this I'll put
this on one hand this is also a dropper
formula I'll drip this down one hand
just one hand Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam on
these five nails and I'll take this
fingernail because I feel it gets more
gentle and I'll just kind of gently
scrape a push back my cuticles and
gently scrape I also have a tool a sally
hansen plastic tool that I use sometimes
but sometimes I just feel like I need to
get in there gently with my nail because
I feel like I can control the pressure
better when it's my own fingernail kind
of getting in there I don't know if
that's okay think do I am NOT a nail
technician but this is what I choose to
do I'm not saying it's good or bad it's
just what I do maybe it's bad i don't
know but for me that's what I choose to
do and I feel like it really makes my
nails stronger they are whiter when I
use it like it's just a really really
nice product and after that I usually
just take coconut oil or or cocoa butter
I have some cocoa butter that I got a
long time ago from from Coastal Scents
they sell raw cocoa butter take a little
bit of that and rub it on my nails and
it works great or just plain coconut oil
and rub it on my cuticles I really
really like that a lot Florrie says she
loves the sinful colors amazing summer
collection Beauty key holder says butter
london's patent shine 10x is amazing
fast drying two coats last all week
Snape's honey says orly in China Glaze
of pretty colors to hashtag nail polish
junkie living living like Julie says I
have one SI hace polish and it is
beautiful and Krista says sometimes I
even use press on toenails I still can't
believe those exist but they're amazing
press on toenails
as I did not knew that was real um
Catherine says where do you buy jhula
back you want to buy julep from juleps
website you do not want to buy julep in
the storage because it's way way way
more expensive julep had the new julep
maven program you can join but the best
thing you can do to get julep is to get
one of their mystery boxes I know that
sounds scary because its mystery but
they you will get well over a hundred
dollars where the stuff for like 25
bucks it is so worth it and you'll be
able to see one or two of the products
that are in the box before you buy it
sometimes they'll even give you a choice
whether you want box a or box bmat box a
has a blue polish inbox V has a pink
polish so you can pick which one you
want and it really is a great way to
load up on a lot of julep products
sometimes I end up even getting repeats
because of God so many of their boxes
but you know I'm Garcia says I push mine
back um I push mine back to with my
thumbnail and I use coconut oil and
olive oil from the kitchen Mike you'll
see work exactly the same person we
might as well just you might as well be
sitting here because we have the exact
same opinion Billy says well I never got
a lot of chat before glad to have you
here Billy are you Billy from Harris go
because you have a Billy on periscope
all right I'm tribute e says nails inc
is really good too Tiffany says she
loves at the mystery boxes meet you
Tiffany dogged me to die menschen
Tiffany dawn has a YouTube channel that
i mentioned that yet she does all right
I don't think I wanted to show you as
far as nails are these color changing
nail cautious oh my gosh that went by
really fast all of a sudden million nine
minutes left color changing nail
polishes I have two different brands
these color change in the Sun which is
really really fun the first one I want
to talk about is these this del Sol
color changing nail polish there's
actually a del Sol store in Virginia
Beach where my sister-in-law Liz and I
got a ton of these one thing I like
about this brand is that you have the
Polish here and then if you look on the
top it'll show you the shade that it
changes into in the Sun which is really
really fun and it's just really had
novelty one thing i don't like about
these i feel like it takes like three
coats to get 20 calcium some of them I
feel like it even like it doesn't even
really get to opacity so I feel like I
need to put them over like a white
polish or something to really get the
that the polish to be
ok so I do like most of them a lot but
so everyone so I think there's like one
or two I have like seven of seven or
eight of them because they had like some
kind of deal or you bought four and it
was like I don't know is whatever you
know this deals and they suck you in so
I got a bunch of them and they were
definitely a couple that were not okay
but this was one that I really liked
this one is in the shade superhero I did
notice that when I went back the next
summer all of the shades had changed I
don't know how fast they go through
these different shades how much how fast
they change them out but this is one
that I really really liked Alma says I
bought this Dale so once my husband
bought brought them from somewhere a
whole box of them oh nice and in sasha
says sahaja says both awesome Cathy's
are here hi Nana Kathy and Kathy Murphy
there's a periscope people God Lee
Murphy and nana nana Kathy we shot you
Nana Kathy thrilling is says marc jacobs
sucks but i have one marc jacobs one
more chickens Paul you know what I think
I even brought that one back I think I
did it I got a Marc Jacobs posh i did
and i ended up bringing it back because
i thought the price point was way too
high because it shipped really fast i
couldn't believe it would not believe
how fast it was um melissa says my color
change pas dress is from Ruby way
speaking of Ruby wing now this polish
these things are really good really
really good I can't remember this one I
think changes to a deeper shade of pink
and then I have a green one I can't
remember what she what changed because
it's been a whole year since I'm use it
and I haven't used it a whole lot
because it's really really really loud
sugar pie 1 2 3 says she has a YouTube
channel yay Oh Natalie says makeup
revolutions as an amazing liquid
lipstick there I heart makeup range lip
love I think they're called nice so I
just says have you ever tried illamasqua
and did it ship for you I've never tried
el Nazca nail polishes never but this
brand nail polish is very very opaque
very opaque and really fun to use oh
hold on a minute I even did some nail
art with this once if you look way back
on my Instagram they actually reposted
my my picture of my nails is my only
nail polish picture that was ever repos
actually might be one of my only
Instagram pictures that's ever been
reposted by prayer
because I'm such an ordinary person on
Instagram like I can't do though
Instagram like awesomeness that people
read posts and stuff but I mean this is
just a really wonderful formula it's so
bright it's wonderful it's wonderful
Marcia says I have one channel polish it

day just crap for thirty dollars um
Nicole's like yeah Jen Navy posted you

gotten ever like but it really wasn't
very nice now look I have to say it was
one of those i think i got it from
cutepolish it was like the droplets oh
you know what we'll keep talking about
look cuz i want to show you because i
was really proud of it you know like i
finally got someone to repost but it's
like worry about goodbye instagram like
way back like years ago i'm just gonna
keep scrolling like this while I talk to
you guys um Garcia says nothing just a
brand name and I find that with a live
nail polishes like I have an arse nail
polish that I'm just not biggest fan of
it's just very very ordinary I have to
say I'm just go all the way back to the
getting's I know that it's like way back
or here's another one he has the other
Ruby wing nail polish right here that I
have shake it up this one is in the
shade cut grass and this one is in the

can let me switch over to my view so i
can show you okay so Oh what if you guys
can see that but it's white I think that
the design from cutepolish but it shows
the inside and outside so inside it
looks like bright and then outside it
gives a dark back this was from hmm july
fourteenth two thousand
14 with the only time I was ever
reposted what does that send a friends
with direct message now I don't want to
do that but yeah so you can see the
colors of the polishes change like you
see how those are like the inside colors
and then those are the outside college
because I was holding the bottles
outside kind of give you an idea of what
it looked like but yeah I was so proud
so proud all right let me flip back over
to the collective brain we've got four
minutes left and chat four minutes left

Hansen quick dry works great on any
tough on top of any nail polish nice
