starting is it working
yeah yeah hello my friends welcome to
the what's of a makeup chat it is so
good to be here and have it actually
working early this is awesome
hope everybody is doing well yay okay oh
my goodness
I apologize for the terrible quality of
the video stream already because I can
tell that it's already terrible at this
point there is nothing I can do about
the quality of the stream so I apologize
that it's such low resolution but
YouTube changed things and I can no
longer put it at a high quality I have
to do some some tweaking and figuring
out and googling and things continue to
Google to figure out how to make it
better quality so I apologize if that
bothers you but today we're gonna be
talking about a bold makeup look and I'm
so excited about this because I used to
be terrified of a bold makeup look
absolutely terrified and I was strictly
natural makeup like no way was I wearing
a bold lip and then I started doing
YouTube and doing YouTube gave me so
much confidence to try bolder looks
being on periscope and having people
encouraged me to do bolder looks and
kind of help me with it and help me do
it but not everybody has people on
periscope to help them so I figured I
would help you a little bit are the
things that I've learned about how to
create a bold book how to transition
from a neutral to a bold and some of the
best bold makeup look products we're
gonna work together with the collective
brain of makeup awesomeness in order to
talk about the best product because not
everything that works for me will work
for you so that's why we have the
collective brain so that we can kind of
come to a general consensus of some of
the best things because every once in a
while there's something that I really
like but like nine people and the
collective brain or like know that
products terrible Jenn and that's like
me well I don't know why it works for me
and then I'll find out that they all
have oily skin or whatever it is and
it's like oh oh there you go because I
don't have all these skits that's the
point of the collective brain so
speaking of the collective brain I need
to
good morning to them because when
someone comes into my house I like to
say good morning so we now invited you
all into my home and I'm gonna say hello
to the people that work here first let
me take a sip of coffee for us cuz my
husband just brought this to me
thankfully right before it started he's
amazing I'm gonna set this over here the
morning to catherine downing tech check
out her YouTube channel red headed for
trouble good morning good morning
Valerie C Turner and Denise good morning

okay so if I did not say good morning to
you good morning to you thank you so
much for being here I appreciate you
good morning in Portland Oregon good
morning to you oh it's early there
thanks for getting up so early for me I
appreciate it
all right Sarah best of luck with your
health health things going on so hang
out try to relax
take deep breaths I will be thinking of
you I hope everything is okay all right
so let's go ahead and get started so the
first thing I want to talk about is
setting your base the way that I set my
base like my base of makeup is exactly
the same for a bold look versus a
natural look I feel like when you try to
do too much coverage and you're not used
to it you can kind of sometimes give
yourself that overdone look
that's just my personal opinion
sometimes people want you're usually
doing a full-coverage makeup look and
then definitely you should continue to
do that I think but I feel like thanks
tab sorry side note getting distracted
alright so anyway I feel like you should
do you when it comes to your basic
makeup so I'm not gonna do a whole lot
of foundation and things you really need
to kind of play trial and error of what
you like as far as your base with you
like a light coverage your medium
coverage or full coverage and just kind
of go from there but I don't think you
necessarily need a full coverage
foundation with a bold look I don't
think it's a hundred-percent necessary
you look at some of the beautiful
redheaded women that have the freckles
shining through and then the bold look
going with it and it's gorgeous it's
absolutely gorgeous good morning to
Beauty hall for one one make sure you
follow her on Instagram she's one of our
reporters yes she Diaries mask face but
you know full coverage can look
beautiful on some people it's just it
doesn't look beautiful on everybody so
you just have to kind of look at
yourself and kind of you know take some
photos of yourself and and kind of take
a step back and see you can always go
over to our Facebook group which is
what's up a makeup slash group slash
what's up and makeup wait sorry
facebook.com slash group slash what's up
and makeup you can go ahead over there
and if you're curious about you know a
look that you did and you want some
honest opinions don't really throw your
picture up there and ask people what
they think and people will be nice it
would be very nice but if you ask for
honest opinion people will also give
that to you as well
so yes hello everybody so good to see us
as I try to do a medium coverage
foundation when I go bold it evens out
yes and I kind of do similar the same
way but I think everybody their skin
being different it could go either way
but I'm with you stuff I do a medium
coverage so I'm not gonna do a lot of
foundations or concealers and stuff like
that today but I do want to talk about
let's go into eyes first because that's
my favorite I've been talking to more
people lately about what what the thing
is everyone's got their thing that they
love their feature that they love to
accentuate and for me I love to do eyes
some people it's cheek some people its
lips eyes are my thing so I wanted to
show you this I had a really great
experience with this palette yesterday
I'm gonna hopefully be reviewing this
next week if not next week the week
after this is the masquerade Baiju vias
and you can see all of these bold
shades in here and some people oh my
goodness in Australia sorry I'm
distracted somebody's from Australia
whoa that's a crazy time was it like
middle of the night goodness
but anyway so you've got a lot of bold
colors in here so people that like
natural look too may want to stay away
from something like this and you
shouldn't you shouldn't stay away from
it there's lots of ways to do a bold
look without going overboard if you want
to transition from neutral to bold one
way that I like to transition from
neutral to bold and something like this
is to do a neutral look and then just
pop some color on the lower lashline
just throw a little blue on the lower
lash line but I wouldn't throw red or
pink on the lower lash line at first
because they kiddin sometimes look a
little bloody it can look a little
creepy with red or pink but Purple's are
very beautiful on every single eye color
if you're ever worried about not knowing
what color to start with start with
purple it doesn't matter what your eye
color is what your skin tone is start
with some kind of purple that makes you
feel good because I just feel like
purple is one of those ones that it can
be a little bit calmer on the eyes and
also it complements I think everybody I
really do I love
I think purple is fantastic for makeup
so Steph says my problem with masquerade
palette is that there isn't another like
shape for me to work with so I have to
pull yes exactly and that's a problem
I'm having with it too I wish there was
a matte shade like this I would love
that I also don't have a transition
shade that I particularly like in here
but that's just me personally so I pull
for my brow bone shade and I pull for my
transition from here but for the bold
you can always pop a little in the lower
lash line you can also do a neutral look
and then pop just a little bit of color
a deeper color in the outer corner so
you can pop some of these shades that
are a little bit darker in your outer
corner and then blend it out you can
blend that with a brown you can blend it
out with a little bit of black but don't
be scared of black black can be really
scary intimidating for people but think
about black is just adding a shadow
don't think about Elvira mistress of the
dark you know like you don't necessarily
have to work you about you know block
eyeliner and you know black lips like
and be scary you know black can just be
used to you know just
keeping up the look a bit so don't be
afraid to add a little bit of black in
the outer corner to give you a little
bit of smoky look and then blend it out
with a little fluffy a nice fluffy brush
for p.m. and all a nice distract there's
so many interesting things happening 3
p.m. in Ireland well isn't this
convenient for people in that part of
the world oh my goodness alright anyway
moving on if you like something a little
more bold one thing I did yesterday that
I love it's on my Instagram is I you can
see it here in the purple being a little
bit funky as I mix these two so what I
did was I took and this will probably be
part of the review I took both of these
I mixed them together I put it all over
the lid then what I did was I took the
purple by itself and put that in the
outer corner then I took this shade by
itself and put it in the inner corner
and it's like instant beautiful colored
I like it was perfect I was so happy
with it like I'm not trying to say that
I'm perfect in any way but in my opinion
when I'm trying to like you know when
your gosh that came out really really
wrong what I'm trying to say is like I
don't know what am I trying to say for
me and my makeup application it seemed
like it came out perfect for me it came
out exactly the way I wanted it to
that's what I'm trying to say it came
out exactly the way I wanted to not that
I am perfect did I showed application
because I'm definitely not perfect I am
not as good as a lot of people on
YouTube and on Instagram but for me I
thought like it came out exactly the way
I wanted it to that's the way I want to
say this but you could do that with any
of these colors you know mixing green or
the blue or the teal or even this shade
over here this Dahlia that's another way
to kind of go a little bolder without
without going too bold is go with like
like a burgundy something like that
something that's closer to the neutral
tones that you're using so going like a
little bit cray or a little bit burgundy
or a little bit warmer Brown something
like that so it'll it'll definitely give
you a little bit more of a bold look
without going overboard so that's one
thing I want to just show you and
there's a lot of really beautiful bold
eyeshadow palettes coming out the new
Kat Von D one looks absolutely gorgeous
I have my Kat Von D me vida loca so I'm
probably not I'm probably gonna skip
though new one just because I have this
and
use it that often and there's gonna be
so many people reviewing it and I have
so many eyeshadow palettes that I want
to review I'm probably gonna end up
skipping it but anyway yeah so um that
girl with curls I would love a demo of
your look yesterday I think I'm gonna
include it in the in the review when I
review the genius place palette I'm
gonna I think I'm gonna do that as you
know I like to do the demo of the
products I think I'm gonna do a demo of
kind of like that it's super easy to do
I mean really it's three steps well once
you set down your crease color you know
cuz you want to do your transition in
your crease you mix the two put it on
your lid dark on the outside light on
the inside blend it all out with a brow
bone color and you're done so super easy
super easy Andrea says I'm debating if I
should buy the Kat Von D matte metal
palette oh it looks so beautiful
I'm wait you know what I saw Tara babies
I put out a review for it and I'm
wanting to watch that review I just
haven't had a second yet but I really
want to watch it Nancy says if you can
splurge get the green you'd be impelled
to go with this and thankfully Nancy
bought that one for me too
Nancy is money much sugar mama Sony I've
got this one too I mean I haven't used
this one as much I think I've only used
this have I used this at all I don't
think I've used this all yet because I
was working on those holiday palettes I
worked I did the lorac mega pro 3 those
are the ones I was focusing on but these
are next because these are about to
rerelease so these are the ones I'm
gonna focus on I just started really
focusing on using these I don't think
I've even use this yet but this week I'm
not gonna review these this week this
isn't gonna be on the channel this week
this will be the following week because
I need at least a full week to play with
those before I make any opinions any
full opinions so far so good though so
far so good
so reading mom says I have me meet a
local remix but I love the metal match
so much more do you really really and
Rima says the Kat Von D is so worth it
oh really you guys you're bad influence
on me Teresa says what Pat will be good
for the office that's a little bull
honestly I feel like you just need to
find if you're just adding a little bit
of color you don't have to invest in a
full like expensive palette you don't
you just need to find maybe even just a
single eyeshadow go get a L'Oreal
infallible you know those little ones
three to six dollar ones find a shade
it's calling to you and just start with
one you know one one eyeshadow that you
you are not if you're not sure about it
you know don't invest in a big huge
palette if you're not sure if you want
to go with a bold look you don't need
fifteen bold colors if you're not sure
about a bold look you know just get like
one or get like a drugstore palette you
know if you see something I don't don't
feel like you need to invest you know
that's something that I one thing I want
to talk about when I get to lips I'll
just talk about it now
I think the worst thing you can mistake
you can make when you are going from
transitioning from a when you're
transitioning from a neutral look to a
bold look it's a spent a lot of money on
something that is very bold for example
when I was starting to transition into
bold looks I bought this YSL lipstick
this is in the shade 0-4 it's Rouge
quick Couture lipstick I'm embarrassed
with how much I paid for this and how
few times I've used this I think I've
used this three times and how much I
paid for this
it's stupid it was absolutely stupid I
don't know what I was thinking now that
I am doing more bold lips I need to
break it out more often but it's like
why did I do that why didn't I get a
color that I was gonna wear all the time
if I'm gonna invest in something like
this so don't spend all of your
hard-earned money on on things that are
super expensive if you know that it's a
little out of your comfort zone that's
my personal advice on that speaking of
that let's talk about let's go into okay
let's keep going with eyes for a minute
so another thing you can do to bump up
your look oh here we go that girl with
curl says the next Avant pop is a
perfect at low price that is an
excellent recommendation that's a really
great palette the NYX Avant pop out let
me get it real quick cuz I have it right
here
hold on it's berry let me get a couple
hold on I was a really smart thing sorry
no I can't find it I'm so sorry I can't
find it but I found two other things I
can't find the other one pop I don't
know what happened to it
now I'm sad where's my oven pop okay so
back to eyeshadows really quickly before
we go into the liner I got some Coastal
Scents hot pots actually these might I'm
pretty sure there's there's hot pots in
here and then I think there's some other
miscellaneous shadows in here maybe but
that's another way because these are
super cheap on the Coastal Scents
website to get some some really cheap
bold colors and then the 18 color galaxy
sheet palette by BH Cosmetics that's
another good one that's super cheap it
works really really really well so there
you go those are a couple of them and
then I do agree with the next I bought
pop absolutely yes Josi glam I'm going
there I'm gonna go there she's talking
that color pop we're gonna go there okay
tooth they sketch marker this one I
initially really liked and I'm finding
that the more I use it the less I like
it I feel like the formula is just a
little too wet but it's good it's good
but it's just a little bit too wet so
the Jessie's Girl if you've been around
my channel for any length of time you
probably know about my favorite liquid
eyeliner by Jessie's Girl it's six seven
seven dollars on the Jessie scroll
website you can also get it on Amazon
but I think it's a little more expensive
on Amazon but it's the perfect liquid
eyeliner if you've never worn eyeliner
on your top lid this is I'm telling you
the way to go absolutely it's
inexpensive so if you don't like it it's
it's gonna be alright you can get this
so close to your lash line just just
draw if you're not used to wearing
liquid eyeliner just draw the line so
close to your lash line just get it in
really really small at first then as you
get more comfortable make it a little
bit thicker in the center going outward
don't even do a wing at first don't even
don't do a window first just get it out
to your outer corner then once you get
it a little bit thicker and you're
feeling pretty good about that then you
can start adding just a word
tiny little extension just I wouldn't
call it a wing just a little tiny
extension and then as you get better at
that extend it a little more and a
little more and the next thing you know
you're gonna have a full winged cat eye
like I'm telling you you just have to
take it baby steps and it may take you a
few months to get to that full bold cat
eye wing but that's okay you know I mean
and not everybody wants to wear a cat
eye wig now everybody wants that bold
eyeliner look but if you want to go
there that's a way to do it especially
if you have something like hooded eyes
and you're nervous about it then just
start with the littlest tiniest line of
eyeliner on your on your lid and you can
also use brown - don't feel like you
have to get black you can always use
Brown Stephanie I haven't had any
problems with transferring but also I
don't have hooded lids so I can't um you
know I just I can't you know I I don't
know honestly
but at seven bucks so hopefully it
doesn't Carla wanted to know hey carla
is it better than the trooper Kat Von D
I feel like application wise it's about
the same it's about the same honestly
and trooper has been one of the most
consistent Kat Von D's tattoo liner in
trooper has been the most consistent
liquid eyeliners along with the Stila I
would say this compares to that I don't
know if I can honestly say that it is
better but it's about the same an
application wise it's about the same
because they have the brush tip they're
not the marker tip though the brush tip
so they Bend really nicely and really
easily they don't bend too much that'll
bend too little they're perfect so but
yeah don't be afraid to use brown to
dream is saying the same thing about the
brown Emily says I have hooded eyes it
was very hard to learn how to work with
liquid eyeliner yeah but if you yeah I
bet you did you start with like a very
very thin line because that can really
help Julie says I love the Physicians
Formula
eye booster two and one and a lot of
people really love that one I really
need to try the black one I somewhat
tried the black one
Catherine likes that one too Adam
Adelina says I'm so lazy I always just
align the end of my eye that's a really
good idea - you can just do just like
the outer corner just a little bit but
you don't want to do too thick on just
the outer corner
cuz it'll look weird if you just have
like a little bit of black here Gina's
here hello Gina stephanie says I like
the Kat Von D better I keep getting free
to look samples and have yet to put to
purchase a full-size of it well that's
awfully awesome and lucky that you keep
getting the deluxe samples and really if
you just can get a deluxe sample the Kat
Von D you don't even need a full-size
you really don't because you're supposed
to throw them away every few months
anyway I'm like mascara because of the
bacteria issue Carly says I love both
but I think the Jessie's pulls my eyes
but I have fine lines on my eyes I'm
trying to remember how much fine line
you have yeah I remember you have more
than me girlfriend Carla at Carla knows
me from real people life so we know each
other from like in-person life so I
won't say why but we know each other
from first in life I don't remember you
have a lot of fine lines but I guess I
wasn't really looking too close either
Deidre said that tomforde eyeliner works
great that's good to know
let's see anybody else yeah Juan says
the Stila pen liner is life fantastic
yeah it's a really really good one that
was the one I recommended to my
sister-in-law when she was looking for a
liquid eyeliner to try Kate's pet corner
says I just like to smudge in dark eye
shadow above my lashes the soft look and
defines my lashes yes definitely just be
careful it doesn't get out of control
because I've had that problem where I've
tried to put eyeshadow on my top lid as
far as doing upper eyeliner and
sometimes it can get kind of big kind of
fast because the powder is for me less
it's more difficult to control so
alright Karl I'm gonna have to believe
you on that one I'm trusting you know
your eyes better than I know your eyes
but I've troubled with the shadow not
traveling sometimes I guess it depends
on what kind of brush you usually have
to make sure you use a really really
thin brush Gor delicious pink doll says
NYC has a pink pen liner that she loves
oh let me see a Rouge I'm gonna say Oh
Rouge hey is NYX lingerie liquid
lipstick are they good or not if it's
it's in fine lines and
it's it's in like it's very drying for
me I don't particularly enjoy the NYX
lingerie liquid lipsticks Valerie says
Jen do you have any colorful gel pot
eyeliners that are drugstore no but you
can use the it's not secondly an
eyeliner but you can use the color
tattoos I've seen a lot of people use
that and it looks nice that girl with
curls says L'Oreal has a great pencil it
comes in tons of colors teal purple and
sabrina loves it you know if you're
looking for a lower lash line pop of
color Sephora brand makes excellent
pencils excellent pencils they're ten
bucks
so there are round drugstore prices
because the drugstore prices aren't
going up they're not too far away
they're definitely worth the investment
the sephora pencil liners they're
amazing one year they had a bold
eyeliner set and that was when my
husband was goofing around with makeup
if you don't know my husband used to
have a makeup parody youtube channel and
then he kind of ran out of time and
investment for it but he bought this
this pencil eyeliner set from Sephora
and i use it all the time their
fantastic sauce are just as positions
for my eyebrows to pen is amazing it is
one of the most outed liquid eyeliner
pens in the entire community is the
Physicians Formula one alright so let's
go ahead and move on to lashes because I
saw someone mentioned Sabrina
unfortunately I don't have any more
brand new packages of Sabrina's lashes
this one is the only one that I could
find but if you are looking for bold
fake lashes inky minke lashes is the way
to go I'm trying to show you without
them falling out because I lost the
outer packaging of it but they are even
the ones that look calm or not calm
they're they're still pretty bold if
you're used to if you're not used to
wearing lashes even these are some of
the more calm ones they're kind of crazy
I don't know if I can kind of set it on
to show you but they're just oh no
that's not gonna be good this is not
going to work my friends it was a nice
thought but no that's not gonna work but
anyway I definitely recommend Sabrina's
lashes they are such good quality and
the
the band is perfect bendiness it's not
too thick which is something that I
found with the hood of beauty lashes
that I got in the that I set the Sephora
I get the Hoda Beauty lashes have a very
thick bed which is great if you want
your lashes to stay on but it's not
great if you want to take them off I had
a heck of a time trying to get those
lashes off it was painful it was not fun
so if you're looking for bull lashes I
definitely recommend the inky mickey's
they're very reasonably priced they have
mink lashes but they also have
synthetics I've only ever purchased the
synthetics and I really really like them
a lot if you're looking for more natural
lashes if you're looking to just kind of
step into the lashes I definitely
recommend it especially if you have a
date night or if you have a holiday
party coming up you're trying to go to
I'm telling you you just just try it
just try it you can do it I'm telling
you you can do it I believe in you
because if I can do it you can do it I'm
telling you so what you're gonna do is
you're gonna go and you're gonna buy
some are dells you're gonna buy some $3
are Dell's
from any drugstores Emily says ardell
demi whispies are great for first time
lashes and I feel like the ardell demi
whispies are almost even a little bit
more bold so Gemma says I want I want to
it's just not easy for me and then I'm
afraid they're going to fall off when
I'm talking to someone
oMG the horror you know I'm with you I'm
totally with you and Theresa says I'm
too afraid to try lashes because of my
hooded lids I hate them and not having
hooded lids I can't even like I can't
even speak to it you know and then
Cheryl says ditto Teresa the Anki making
lashes I just got them on Sabrina's
website if you just google inky minky
lashes you'll find them and then our
towels you can find anywhere and they're
super cheap steph says they always come
off and i think people with oily lids
have more of a trouble keeping them on i
haven't had any trouble keeping them on
my normal lids and then elise says the
kiss lashes are awesome very cool that's
good to know I haven't tried those
patients sherry says Oprah's when you
don't have to be anywhere exactly that's
a good idea and one thing I've been
doing that's been kind of fun is if I
just kind of have a down night which
very rarely happens to only happen a
couple of times where I've been like you
know what
only have a video to edit right now or
my video is already done I'm gonna go up
and just play and my makeup room
so I mean most people don't have a room
dedicated makeup go but go in your
bathroom or wherever you get ready
you know it's your vanity and just play
you know and just have fun do one eye
one color and one eye the other color
you know and just practice your
technique and have fun with it you know
put on some Netflix on your phone set it
up that's what I do put my Netflix on
the phone you know and try out some bold
looks try some things that are out of
your comfort zone and you can try one
technique on one eye another technique
mmm I know he's gonna see it except for
maybe your family you know and if they
think you're crazy they're supposed to
love you no matter what anyway so you
know Gary's right so you know when I
definitely recommend trying false lashes
I actually tried false lashes for the
first time on periscope not for the
first time but the first time was
actually successful with it was on
periscope and some of you were there I
know some people that are in this room
right now were there like a year ago or
so when I started wearing false lashes
and I was terrified I was absolutely
terrified and this was like a year ago
wasn't that long ago and you know you
just have to be patient with yourself
and just take it for fun and make sure
you're not trying to be anywhere you
know when you're when you're trying to
play with your lashes for the first time
and just relax you know and just try how
Korean girl says I have hooded lids as
well you just have to practice and buy
lashes that work for your eye shape and
I guess it's just trial and error and I
think starting with those inexpensive
our Dells are a great way to go I don't
recommend going to the dollar store and
getting those the the really inexpensive
ones like the elf ones and the dollar
store ones they're very plasticy they
look really fake and the band is really
difficult to work with I feel like
they're more likely to pop off so just
be very very careful and then though Oh
Carla says maybe it's the liquid you use
the the the ones that I use I've used
the duo and I've also used the Ardell
lastly I like the art Dell just a little
bit more than I like to do oh that's
just my personal opinion
it's actually it's right here this is my
favorite the Ardell last grip lash
adhesive but I haven't tried to many
lash adhesives but this is the one that
I've been loving so yes and then the
other thing too is
you can another thing to make you look
more bold because we're talking about
doing things more bold is that once you
get your lashes on then to add eyeliner
over top and because your lash bands is
straight or at least it hopefully it's
straight
you'll be able to line over top of that
lash band just one stripe higher and
it'll be nice and straight because
you've got a little guide there from
your lashes you do want to try to cover
up that lash band if you can see it like
kind of give your eye a look and see if
you can see the lash man cover it up
with some eyeliner and that will
definitely help with that a lot but this
is really good this is really good I
really like it
so lashes are we good on lashes anything
else about the lashes Emily says I like
to do Oh black glue the black they do a
black glue I haven't tried the black one
let's say beauty and Sara says best fit
for fake lashes wait 45 seconds for the
glue to dry that is very very important
and you know what I don't wait that long
because I'm impatient I usually wait
about 20 to 30 seconds but I should
probably wait longer because I think
it'll be easier if I waited longer but
I'm so impatient the other thing is is
when you're applying lashes you're
trying to go for a bolder look is to
feel that wet glue on your eye and line
it up with the outer corner of your eye
and then I slowly press it inward and
making sure to get that inner and outer
corner those are the most important
places to press it is the inner and
outer corner to make it go on there the
other thing is too is a lot of people if
you want to do something oh by Renee
thanks for dropping by another thing you
can do if you want to just try a natural
look is get some of those little not
natural but a little more bold get one
of those Ardell the little tiny ones
chop it in half and just use half of the
lash on the outer corner I did that for
a little while when I was first starting
out with lashes years ago and then I
abandon it I don't know why but I
stopped doing it but that's another
thing you can do as well is just to do
half of an eyelash and you can actually
do I don't recommend using the one lash
for both eyes though because the inside
and the outside can be different on a
pair of lashes they can be different
lengths unless you know that it's
symmetrical you want to make sure you do
the longer portion on the outer corner
and the shorter portion on
inner corner but um but yeah I really
like it actually you know what thinking
about it no still not gonna work I'm
sorry I was doing a little bit of mental
thinking about things now that's not
gonna work
hey Nicole is here from yay or nay
Nicole will definitely check out her
YouTube channel let's see a Miss candy
you're gonna make some videos soon so I
can start telling people about how
awesome you are let's say Taylor says oh
but there are Adele press-on lashes that
I can totally apply I've never tried the
press-on ones I've never done that so
Veronica says I dot some glue on my
hands so I can see where it's at with
drawing before the lash up before
putting laughing oh so you put it on
your lash and then you put a little dot
on your hand and then you test it on
your hand to see how dry it is how
genius are you how genius are you like
that's amazing so you like you tap oh
and it's like a test for what's actually
on the lash band without actually having
to touch the lash band that is genius
um Julie says how much do you trim when
I trim my lashes I trim just the outer
one section like I look for like a
section so if I were going to trim these
these are already trims but if I were
gonna trim these I would trim the outer
corner i would probably trim like either
just this one little piece or i would
trim this whole piece here but make sure
you know exactly where on your lash like
how far you're going over on one side
cuz you're going to do the same thing to
the other side you always want to trim
the outer corner allisyn's has been
practicing with chibis that's a great
idea
gemma says wait they're a press-on
lashes where they'd in all my life
I always worry they're gonna fall off
that's why I haven't bought them yet
Ida Lee is making me want to sing hello
it's me Anna Lena says she's has trouble
doing the press-on lashes all right you
spent a while on lashes so let's move on
a little bit so be definitely to get the
lips this week so I felt really really
bad we didn't get slips last week for
brows if you want to try a bolder brow
the what the big product I wanted to
talk to you about was the dip brow
pomade by Anastacio this will give you
straight up Instagram brows Instagram
brows in the house with this if you want
something that's a little bit calmer but
a little
little more bold kind of in the middle
try the benefit Cabral that's a really
good job homey but the pomades are gonna
give you a bolder brow if that's
something you're looking for the pencils
are gonna give you a little more natural
of a look and you just take an angled
brush like an angled flat brush very
very thin and use that to apply it's one
thing I wanted to mention let's go into
lips let's just go ahead and pop in a
lips a little earlier than I expected to
go into lips but let's do it
Adaline I want to know what I'm drinking
I'm drinking coffee coffee
straight coffee real coffee not a cup
with some air in it did I pretend to sip
it's got real coffee in it let's see
alright moving on to lips so if you're
not used to a bold lip one thing that
you can do and you can start off with a
colored lip balm so one of them and I
really like is the sugar fresh sugar
ones they have a lot of these little
gift sets coming out it's a great way to
try this formula because it's a
fantastic formula and also get little
minis of a color that you maybe you're
not used to wearing but this has a
little bit of color you can see but it
gives an opportunity for your natural
lips to shine through not shine through
but it's not super opaque so it's not
really scary to go on so definite
recommend on these or really any colored
lip balm I think Burt's Bees make some
things like that but yeah I mean these
are these are great for a nice
transition and you're already into bold
lips some recommendations for formula
you guys know how much I love the over
liquid lipsticks these are fantastic one
thing I notice about the Ofra is that I
don't notice about other liquid
lipsticks is that they do well it's the
Ofra and then the bare minerals gem news
the baron arrows minerals Jen nudes
would have been the ones I would have
recommended for the natural lip those
are my personal favorite because I don't
mind reapplying as long as I'm
comfortable I don't like to be
uncomfortable and that's the way I feel
about the Jen nudes same thing with the
okras but the lasting power on these if
you blot off the excess they last a
really long time this one is in the
shade Solano actually got this from
Sanders Kennedy because the guy over the
guy who owned Oprah handed Sanders this
giant bag of liquid lipsticks and
Sanders let me pick some which was
really really nice of him what's that me
I'm gonna do with liquid lips I canyon
wear liquid lipsticks and then you
Tan's in this big package of liquid
lipsticks like for reals for reals
you gave Sanders little lipsticks like
what I know he's got like four times as
many subscribers as I do but still man
I'd even wear like a lipsticks but
anyway he was nice enough to give me
some it's this one that he gave me and I
really like this for fall I haven't worn
it on camera yet but I've worn it in my
day today it's got a nice shimmer to it
and that is one of those it's really
really nice formula it's very creamy and
it this one is not so bold that it makes
you look like oh my god I'm at a crazy
lip on it's kind of like a natural but
it's got that shine to it that I really
really like a lot and it's just a really
nice color I really like this one a lot
for a little bit out of my comfort zone
if you're looking for a lipstick formula
honestly like if you're looking for bold
lips the color pop ones I really like
the lippie stix
I do I really like them a lot and I you
know color pop has gotten a lot of flack
lately for a lot of things and you know
it's funny because I asked people on my
facebook I also asked on the F cos group
which is the group for creators for
YouTube video creators and instagramers
and all of us are on this group called f
cos that is you know part of FC and I
asked them the same question as you know
what liquid lipsticks don't work for you
which ones are the ones that that you
just don't like and overwhelmingly
overwhelmingly the most popular thing
that people said that did not work for
them were the colour-pop liquid
lipsticks the original matte but people
were saying the statins are better but
people hate i mean i don't know i have
what ten of them and I stopped reaching
for them because they're so incredibly
drying they're so drying Hanna says I
just found the NYX liquid suede and
cherry skies it's my favorite doesn't it
dry out your lips though liquid suede
dry out my lips I don't feel good
Julie says my current favorite is a
Revlon Ultra HD matte liquid lip color
it's so comfortable for liquid lipsticks
interesting thank you so much for that
Julia says hey Jem and everyone I'm late
today but I made it so happy you are
here Julia
Felicia says red is the only bold color
I've worn in public and I think that it
really depends on
a lot of things as far as the red I feel
like red is a one you can either pull
off or it looks really like it might be
too much I don't know if red is the best
one to start with I feel like almost
like if you're if you're gonna start
with a bold color to kind of go a little
deeper of a natural color than you're
used to to make it a little more bold
but some people man can really pull off
that red cool with very deep skin tones
people with very light skin tones oh my
gosh the red is gorgeous but but that
like I don't know man
how oh no Liz says I have a real problem
as you a liquid lipsticks really gor
delicious says among the cosmetics are
very comfortable that's good to know
she diary says concrete cracking up Josi
says it feels like plaster on my lips
Elise says she loves the satin formula
Carly says Emily have a lot of NYC soft
matte lips and I find that some shades
are very patchy but there are some
shades that work for me that's very good
to know
but yeah liquid lipsticks my personal
favorite formulas are the Oprah and the
the bareMinerals gen new but the Gen you
don't have any bold shades so I would go
with the Oprah's for my personal opinion
on the liquid lipsticks and a lot of
times you'll be able to find a youtuber
with a discount code because there are a
lot of people that are sponsored by
Oprah and there's a lot of people that
just get products sent to them by Oprah
over sent me stuff once and then I don't
know what happened after that who knows
but I'm not bitter no I'm not bitter I'm
just kidding
but but anyway live chat gets me every
time but anyway the Oprah formula is
definitely I feel like the best liquid
lipstick for me personally for bold
shades if you're looking for something
bold and you're not used to it or even
if you are used to it I really love that
formula therese says nothing drying it
brings out the light oh at home I can't
I'd missed the beginning of that
conversation so I think I missed Julie
says try the Revlon yeah I missed I
missed part of that conversation and
they don't know what happened with it
she diary says have you tried Oprah
mocha no I have not
should I so Hodges here hi Sasha she's
one of our reporters as well
Annabelle says you can blot a satin
finish and will totally change to a
matte look yes definitely and another
thing you can do a lot of people are
putting on a second I gotta check
something on my I forgot something my
eyeball and I won't you have to look at
it if I got something weird on my ball
all right what I'm getting a product
show while I'm over here
another thing you can do too if you want
to go for that matte look if you've
never done a matte look is sometimes
people will put a silicone primer on
their lips to mattify this is one that I
really like the Smashbox Instamatic this
is really look good I feel like that's
even better than using just a plain
primer that's just my opinion it's
really nice to change that matte look
where am I going more lips more lips
let's talk about more lips uh let's see
Cheryl says the katie-cat Demi maps are
pretty good the kitty perk kitty purry
is a pretty color Oh interesting a Rouge
says but red looks good
look but red looks OMG so good yeah I
mean and I think honestly like I feel
like my skin tone doesn't necessarily
look as good in Reds as very very pale
and deeper like medium to deeper skin
tones I feel like can pull off reds
better than I can like I don't know
that's just me personally the same thing
with hot pinks like I can't do hot pinks
there's some about hot pink that just
makes me lie blondes look really good in
hot pinks belongs and purples I feel
like look really good on deeper skin
tones like I've tried to pull off a
purple and I think I did it once ever
beauty by Sarah says I'm so excited the
glossy lips her Meghan comeback meet you
you know I'm glad that we're kind of
swinging the other way from the mat to
the glossy and the metallic and all of
that because I really do like metallic I
remember when Too Faced came out with
the lips the metallic liquid lips
and I just I was so in love with those
and it just didn't fly because people
just weren't ready for it I think people
are now ready for that metallic lip that
my top lip is really coming back Hannah
says I can only pull off darker reds
never the brighter Reds interesting you
know how pings freaked me out like I
can't even do it
hot pinks are for teens drama said
dreamer says yeah and the Hannah says
I'm super pale okay got it
Veronica says how was the coloured raine
formula I've never tried it you know a
lot of those indie brands they're like
the lipsticks are so expensive you know
eighteen twenty dollars for liquid
lipstick and it's like like I want to
support indie brands but at the same
time it's like eighteen or twenty
dollars for one product on a brand that
I'm not even sure if I'm gonna like it
like or how much I'm gonna wear it
that's why color pop was so easy to buy
and when I think color pop came out of
the gate so strong is because that cheap
price tag people just went for it
you know because you can get you know
for colour-pop liquid lipsticks for the
price of one color drain and the quality
of the color grain is probably
exponentially better than the color pop
but thinking about spending $18 on
liquid lipstick I don't even know like I
can't swatch and can't try on I don't
know and then we're turning it like if I
don't like it like you can't return it
or you can but it's like I'm taking by
your post office the upbeat chiming
Emily you know sometimes you pay
shipping sometimes you don't but I don't
know man I don't know left for regular
lips I really like the color pops like
this bright pink I don't think I've ever
worn this ever ever I bought it with the
intention of trying it another one that
I've never used never worn in life this
one this one's called by the way this is
called I heart this this is one I've
never used check this out how about this
on what's up and makeup what you think
about that BAM
this is called bull chick mmm girl or
boy well Cheryl says to face to face
lipstick it's my favorite formula I love
to face lips each to you but I feel like
if you're just trying out a new formula
our new not new for me but if you're
just trying out a bold look I would get
the color pops over the to face just
because if you don't know how much
you're going to wear it
vestment is less that's my biggest
concern with transitioning is just don't
spend a whole lot of money on it
steph says i have a whole box of
colour-pop you and me both girlfriend
you me both they got me they got me they
totally got me Taylor says I like the
toothpaste Matt there are a lot of
deeper shades yes Seth says bull chick
is amazing it is but I've never worn it
she Darby says I have the 2 a.m. by
coloured raine the black one is it good
we need to know about this we didn't
know if it's good or not we have to know
Alesia says I just went and smelled it
and know it smells like all the others
have man I don't even know what you're
talking about it's making me sad of
course that says I could never do black
maybe a cool-toned chocolate brown but
never black I've done I've done
chocolate browns I feel a lot better
about that Lokhande says going back all
off-topic
I found Urban Decay's electric pressed
pigment palette it's on clearance from
$49 for $24 yes it is the that is a
really really good point and I used to
have it over here the the Urban Decay
electric palette is on mad super sale
right now lots of places I don't know a
hundred for that where did you find that
but I I'm not sure where you found it
but I know it's been lots of places
we've had in the news Nicole put it in
the news Nicole where where was it on
sale do you remember because Nicole's
our sales and deals reporter she's here
yeah it's super bold it's really bold
it's almost to the point where it's like
hard to work with because it's so
pigmented and so bold Cheryl says
unicorn tears is great after you figure
out what to do with it yes to face
unicorn tears is that even still
available to face unicorn tears but it's
it really is um it's a lot of fun I have
a whole video on it if you just search
for Too Faced in my videos you should be
able to find you'll see unicorn tears
really big in the thumbnail and I show
you how it works it's really fun it's
like an iridescent lip topper so fun so
fun and it really transforms shades you
can see me taking natural lipsticks and
putting unicorn tears over top of it and
it's really a fun shade to play with
Cecilia says she had black lips
yesterday you go girl that's awesome Oh
Jenna says Sephora for the for the
Sephora has the Urban Decay that's what
I'm hoping and Urban Decay too
okay good to know thank you so much
Taylor and Jenna I appreciate
all right anything else I think that was
I went into the lips really really early
so we've got like 10 minutes left
did I miss anything for the bold look
let me think Oh contour I wanted to
touch on contour a little bit and blush
and face products these are not bring
any over here and they brought me over
here but go easy on the contour I feel
like if there's anything you don't need
to go over the top on its blush and
contour I feel like it's one of those
things that I think I feel like blush
and contour is one of those things that
should always be relatively subtle in
everyday life on Instagram it's one
thing but I feel like in everyday life
it's so easy to go overboard with a
contour and a blush and just feel
complete clown face and stripy and crazy
highlighter on the other hand
highlighter Oh girlfriend or boyfriend
oh we got something at some bold
highlighters let's get into some
highlighters because oh you guys are so
smart
I love the collective brand of makeup
awesomeness you know what's funny I
guess it was a couple years ago I did a
video I forget what it was it was like
it's one of those tag videos where they
Astrid random questions about makeup one
of them was like what's the one makeup
product you could do without and you
know what I said I said highlighters I
said highlighters are one of the most
yeah this is probably almost an exact
quote highlighters are one of the most
useless makeup products you could go
annihilator not eyeliner man is my
opinion changed over the years I will
tell you all right I got a handful I got
handful here's some bold ones this is
what I want to talk about this is the
artist Couture by angel highlighter and
I actually met angel in New York City
seemed like a really nice guy only met
him for a few minutes but these are like
glittery these are glittery highlighters
to just be aware but if you want to
support an andy brand like glittery
glowy highlighters there's I got the
4-pack from him okay where I got it did
I get it on want to say I got Ricky's
NYC maybe is where I got this from kind
of oh pull this thing up a little bit if
you can see that but it's got glitter in
it
so you know yes Claudette says I feel
like highlighter accentuates my 60 year
old eye bags and and you know what papi
highlighters are not the best for people
that have texture on their skin they're
just really not you shouldn't be getting
under you're not under your eye though
you shouldn't be getting the highlighter
on your eye you want to stick right here
and if you want to try a little bit of
bold highlighter just try a little bit
on the outer corners the outer corners
you can get away with more than right in
the front so if you want to just try a
little bit right here Oh Mary Mary Lou
where are you right here baby right here
this is my Mary Lou this is my holy
grail
rod or die highlighter Mary Lynn I think
she's a lot of people's ride-or-die
highlighter um and you can get her on
HauteLook for 50% off about every three
months they just had one so look again
in December inch but Oh Mary Lou I love
you Mary Lou's a very poppy highlighter
you get a huge pan of it too
and it's just it's a classic it's one of
those that everybody seems to love it's
like I'm still this kitten for the eyes
I mean it's just one that everybody
loves another one Laura Geller's gilded
honey another fantastic one you can also
get mary lou at Kohl's
but you'll buy it at full price there
unless you have Kohl's cash it's a great
way to spend your Kohl's cash there's
Laura Mercier's more mercy ice Laura
Geller's gilded honey I was just talking
about this last night my sister-in-law
we had like a makeup playdate over at
her house next time I do that Karla I'm
inviting you I'm bringing you with me
right there who you would have loved
that last night it was very you all
right right there Becca is opal it's
another good one and another thing too
is that I feel like with some of these
deeper shades if you have really pale
skin tone you just kind of have to be
careful you can use them as cheek color
as well though keep them on the top of
your cheekbones but you can you can use
them as almost like a double for cheek
color but yeah there's Becca's opal and
then this one is Urban Decay's sin
it's very similar to Mary Lou on me it's
all pretty much the same but it's a
little more champagne just a little bit
more champagne II Nicole says I love
Mary Lou when I want a lot of pop I also
one by Mac is my favorite the Charlotte
Tilbury one is great for more subtle and
I really love to have more Charlotte
Tilbury stuff but it's kind of stupidly
priced and I just can't justify it I
just can't justify it
but yes so those are some of my favorite
super poppy highlighters one thing you
can do too if you're transitioning into
a bolder look is to go light on the eyes
do like a um do you like a Naked palette
or whatever neutral palette you have
start with that on your eyes just
something very very light you know
taking a shade like sin putting it all
over the lid this is for somebody with
my skin tone but something that's
similar to your skin tone I but for me I
would use sin all over the lid a little
bit of buck in the crease just as a
transition and that's it for your eye
look that's it
then go with your bold lip you know get
your black eyeliner on your bold lip
maybe a little bit of a contour action a
little bit of highlight light on the
blush gorgeous absolutely gorgeous
really really nice so that's one thing
that's a suggestion too if you're trying
to transition is to do a light eye and a
bold lip do you have to do a light eye
on a bold lip with a bold lip absolutely
not
you can do a light eye you can do a bold
eye with a bold lip you can you
absolutely can but it's just gonna make
more of a statement so you just have to
decide what you're going for so
Adelina says you can build it up you can
build up anything absolutely Adelina oh
wait no Elvis check yes ride-or-die the
Luminizer sisters yeah and it's funny
the the girl that I was hanging out with
over my sister-in-law's had the man eyes
that's the best way to try all those
products and she has like a more medium
skin tone
she's deeper than me and she had she
mostly used cindy-lou that was the one
that she used it's a little bit more
pink toned and a little bit deeper shade
it's a little closer to opal let me see
if I can finally
Betty Lewis uh um Betty Lou is the
bronzer my Cindy Lou is broken and I
need to just suck it up and put some
alcohol in it and fix it but I just
haven't it's also not quite as poppy as
Mary she's a little more calm there you
go um LeConte I'm not gonna try to hold
on and she said something really
important and I spent too much time
trying to decode her name okay let me
see
look Conda I'm just gonna say Lokhande
max wis trip guilt is coming back as per
what spoon makeup yeah well they're
saying it may be coming back it may be
coming back which means it probably will
and that one's very very popular but
there is Cindy Lou and it's a little
more subtle but yes she has a more
medium skin tone she said that's her
favorite Cheryl says Jen Kevin a kwan
celestial like having a kwan highlight
that I have is this one here this is the
candle light powder that's the only one
that I have and it's a little more
subtle it's not quite as Pompey that's
the only cabinet Quan one that I have
and more subtle highlights we talked
about last week in the natural makeup
look like the hourglass the elf this one
now new added for my collection the
Fiona Styles one are a little more
subtle and I feel like in Kent candle
light is a little more subtle but I
don't know the other one I don't love
them oh the Anasazi of glow kits oh my
gosh they're amazing obviously amazing I
actually brought my glow kit that I have
over last night it's actually downstairs
still in my bag that I brought last
night to my makeup play party that I
went to over my sister-in-law's
but yes the Anasazi highlighters are so
bold and so poppy definite recommend on
those and they last a really long time
too they're very very very nice for a
more bold highlight just be careful just
keep it keep it on those cheekbones you
if you're transitioning and you're not
used to using highlighter don't do the
nose or the chin or the forehead hold
off on that till you get used to the
cheeks and
and you know start experimenting with
the other places because what I found is
that when I do my nose because my nose
is a little bit bigger if I do my nose
it makes my nose look huge and it's
probably operator error I've tried to
slim down with contour and it always
looks crazy like when I've tried to
contour my nose it looks insane like it
absolutely looks and saying I can't do
it in a way that is functional like I
mean candy Johnson in my pocket to like
teach me I've watched so many tutorials
on nose contouring and face contouring
and it always looks so stupid on me
horrible really really bad John's like
you dirt on your nose like it's not dirt
I tried to contour it's always so bad I
said me said the kathleenlights
highlighter palette is $39 I've heard
good things about that the makeup geek
and kathleenlights highlighter palette
the only I wish I wish that she had
released them as three singles like her
more Alana's releasing the singles now I
wish she released them as three singles
instead of a palette that was just my
personal thing because I feel like some
of them aren't necessarily for like the
the darker ones are better for darker
skin and then like it was like she made
a palette for multiple skin tones but
when you make a palette for multiple
skin tones that's for that kind of thing
it's like for a good makeup artist you
know you're gonna want multiple skin
tones but for the typical person you've
got one skin tone so you don't need high
layers for multiple skin tones you know
what I mean so I don't know I just wish
that they she had released them as
singles instead that's just my personal
opinion for an eyeshadow palette I feel
like you really see it for multiple skin
tones is really really important but for
a highlighter palette I think it's just
a little weird because I don't know I
just that's just my personal opinion
Ashley says Wayne Goss has great nose
contouring tutorials and I've watched
those two girlfriend and they just I
can't do it man it looks stupid
it looks outright dumb like I look like
I've got dirt on my face
same thing with when I cut try to
contour like the outside sometimes it
looks okay but I gotta go really light
kind of go really really light I've got
I finally got the cheeks down I think
I'm good on the cheeks but I'm not good
the rest summer says I'm so scared to
nose contour girlfriend you and me both
you and me both alright what else is
going on we're almost out of time
anybody else want to talk about anything
before we go candy says the Physicians
Formula shimmer strips are the best who
I don't have any of those fantastic and
Oh someone had said earlier I kind of I
read it and then went and back on my
head because in the middle of a sentence
that very shimmery highlighters make
them look like a grease ball and that
definitely can be an issue that
definitely can be an issue and I think
just dabbing it on let me get something
real quick this right here
I think dabbing it on with a with a fan
brush I think can really help to control
how much product you're using you know
and just putting the tag a little bit
and just tapping it on just a little
tiny bit at first and but if you don't
like the way it looks
you're fine you don't have to don't
don't contour if you don't I mean don't
count or don't highlight if you think if
you don't like the way it looks on you
don't feel pressured by the internet to
do things that you don't feel
comfortable doing just saying no to
highlight you don't like it no don't
give in to peer pressure man it's not
worth it you wasting your money you know
what I mean
so Jenna says she caught it she contours
with chocolate Soleil I've done that
before it look sorry that's okay
yes Carla we need to have a wine and
makeup party soon I'm totally with you
let's go over key cus like what we'll
call key you cocky cuz he could probably
listen you munch listens to me because I
only texture and it have played with my
kids so my kids can come over her house
and play with her girls so Carla its
effects kike tell kike we're gonna have
a makeup party we're gonna teach kike
how to do makeup we're gonna go over
there play I because it's gonna be fun
so but should listen to you more and
she'll listen to me alright anyway
alright I gotta go to lab no one it was
great talking to you guys this week next
week I was thinking about doing this was
a suggestion from from someone in the
community she was saying for next week
to talk about different products for
different ages and I thought that was
really interesting like different
products that work better for younger
people for older people you know
products that we recommend because the
community is
Oh wide as far as a dreams and we've got
people in their late teens early 20s all
the way up to people in their 60s and
70s watching so I feel like we'd have a
great way to talk about you know people
of all ages and what works for different
um different age people mature skin
specifically I feel like gets neglected
a lot on YouTube because I feel like a
lot of the people who make makeup videos
you know look at kathleenlights and
Jacqueline Hill and you know Nicole
Guerrero they're all in their 20s and
they're gorgeous
but I feel like what works for them may
not work for someone that has more
mature skin because you know it's
different and I don't have the most
mature skin either you know I've got
some wrinkles here and there but there's
a lot of people in the community that do
have more mature skin so I think that
would be great to have that conversation
so I think that you know it would be
great to talk about that and also you
know what works for people with with you
know younger skin as well you know that
may be better for people with less
mature skin so that's we'll probably be
talking about next week I thought that
would be a really great topic so I want
to thank you so much for being here this
week I appreciate you so much and I hope
you had fun I'm looking at myself now
and how horrid I look I'm looking at my
fake flowers behind me my sister-in-law
gave those to me as a goofy Secret Santa
gift and they were never meant to be
seen by anybody and you guys been
looking at them the whole time oh that's
too funny you guys been looking at my
nose this whole time and nope sorry I
apologize but if you want to keep going
with the conversation definitely head
over to the whatsapp and make up
Facebook group it's groups slash what's
up and make up it's linked under every
single one of my videos
it may not be under this one because
this one goes through a little bit
differently but it's like two under
every single in my videos it'll say I
want to join an awesome Facebook group
or something and you can click on it and
join their it's a great place to have
wonderful conversations ask more
questions things like that I'm popping
over they are you know commenting on
pictures and they have a lot of daily
challenges so if you like you know being
challenged out of your comfort zone to
try something new and bold you can see
what other people are doing and you can
participate in the challenges and it's a
lot
wanting to share your looks and there's
always like a little thing that says
what the new topic is and it's just run
by people in the community like I don't
do very much on the Facebook group to
run it it's all run by people in the
community which is fantastic because we
all kind of help each other to make it
be an awesome place and it's just a
really great place to be completely
honest so on this iron is like the
coolest Facebook community of all time
in my opinion so head over there you can
also download the West bit makeup app
it's like instagramming you can look for
what's a good makeup or gem those
reviews on your App Store or wherever
you buy your apps and you should be able
to find it that's a lot of fun too and
the where to buy a page on once the
makeup calm if you want to hear about
anything that you saw in the show today
and want to know where to buy it you can
click there and what's on my face videos
over there as well you want to know the

what's the makeup that's there too and I
think that's all my self motion I'm
