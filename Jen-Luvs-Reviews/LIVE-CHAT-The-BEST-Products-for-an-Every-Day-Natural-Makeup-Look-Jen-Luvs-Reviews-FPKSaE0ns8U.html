chat if you're watching me right now i'm
typing into the chat oh oh yes it looks
like it might be working yay oh okay all
right there we go yay okay let's jump
into it because last week I spent like
four minutes like not knowing what I was
doing so well 20 minutes not knowing
what I was doing and then four minutes
explaining about me not knowing what I
was doing and the dog is coming in hello
dog how are you dog let me get my coffee
so if you hear our jingle jangle and
it's my dog's collar let me make sure my
angle looks okay because it looks like
it looks fine so today we're going to be
talking about natural makeup meaning
that it doesn't look like you're wearing
a whole lot of makeup and I thought this
would be a great topic because going
into the winter time people are kind of
going into hibernation they're kind of
like kind of going and it's getting a
little chilly around you know you may
not want to feel like you want to go
full glam so I thought we would talk
about different products that work for
all different skin tones all different
skin types that are great for a natural
look now I only have one skin tone
obviously only one skin type obviously
so that's where the collective brand of
makeup awesomeness thumbs in also known
as the whatsit of makeup chat that's
scrolling right next to me these are the
people that are here live if you'd like
to join us live we're here ten am on the
YouTube channel typically there's a link
under the YouTube video unfortunately
this week I couldn't get it up I was
having some technical difficulties so I
couldn't get the link up but if somebody
has the link to it and wants to post it
in the comments of what's up a makeup I
would not be opposed to someone doing
that because I didn't get to chant me a
chance to put it underneath the actual
video that is my first if a coffee and
it's like life globe oh it's so good
it's so good it's french vanilla it's
delicious okay
brand of makeup awesomeness let's go
back to them so if you are not we
jointly learn what as I was saying is we
get we're here at 10am or not yep 10
a.m. eastern time is the time that I am
here depending on your time so you got
to check their time zones you can always
type into Google about the time zones
take convert whatever time you are CST
to EST and it'll tell you what time it
will help you convert it it's super easy
so anyway let me go ahead and say hello
to the collective brain of makeup
awesomeness whenever people are in my
house I would like to greet them before
I move on to talking about other things
so Julia is here cheyenne is here
Brittany and Tina and Julie are too said
Julia hi Julia uh let's see uh Takai I
think I said that ride in Australia I
hope I said that right I think I said
Cheyenne wassup shared um let's see lots
of people they were all having a nice
conversation early Valerie is in the
house Nikki Roxanne Tabitha's here
Vicki's here Nancy is here Catherine
down and check out her YouTube channel
shelly is here Michelle and Cheryl Abby
is here she said shelly and we'll do a
couple more Aspen is here and Carolyn's
here and the gold digger in that pose
and Trish and Steph are here all right
I'm going to go ahead and scroll all the
way down to the bottom to the most
recent comments if I didn't say hello to
you good morning hello hope you are well
so what we need to start with i think is
foundation that's just me um one little
tip though which I didn't get out I wish
I gotten out but one good tip is let's
say you have a matte foundation and you
don't want to look so flat because
sometimes matte foundations can make you
look like you're not--' have real skin I
mean that's just when it comes down to
it gives you that flat look so one thing
you can do is you can add a luminizing
illuminating primer and I'm like trying
to think off the top of my head going on
sorry guys usually I'm more prepared to
that
and of course I can't find one right
this second but ok but we'll talk to the
clip to bring about their favorite lumen
ating primers so we can actually get
some real information up in this place
so eliminating primer underneath your
matte foundation will help give it a
little more of a natural finish term
please guys down a little bit oh I know
what I did do I didn't put this on the
box oh okay cats here what's up cat
what's up Jen all right there we go that
should be better hopefully okay so
putting that illuminating primer kennel
really really helped I'm going to go
ahead and scroll down and see if there's
anybody that's talking about Becca bat
look back lip primer is amazing
according to Valerie Rose says she
posted the link thank you so much rose
for doing that hello in Puerto Rico yes
happy happy soupy month what does that
mean stuff what does that mean Becca
back lip primer and the mac strobe cream
nice everybody sang the becca anna says
the back of Chu so that's a great
indication that the Becca is awesome
excuse me for a second I had someone say
something to me once that they thought
it was disgusting that I was like
touching my face during the chat so I
try to like go favorite second I'm she
sado makes a great illuminating primer
according to krista peter thomas roth
cheryl says 24 karat gold Julie says the
city color illuminating primer at five
below if you have a five below that is
mid United States typically over to the
east where they sell city co I think you
can buy it online to an Tonetta says
lumi by Maybelline brianna says I just
got to try the toothpaste RX primer I
don't know if extends my foundation but
it was very moisturizing I feel the same
way about that primer definitely
definitely carries this is her first
time able to join hello in Mexico cat
says the hard candy illuminating dropsy
we're getting all this great information
from the collective brain cuz I couldn't
think of a single one I'm just failing
right here but you guys are helping me
out and I appreciate that that's what
the collective brain is all about Briana
says I just wish that Becca wasn't so
expensive I am totally with you on that
but Briana I'm totally with you
okay so along with your illuminating
primer for your matte foundation you of
course don't want to use an illuminating
primer with an illuminating foundation
you can tell just use any old primer for
you know regular foundation you don't
need an illuminating one so you don't
want to overdo it there as far as
foundations and things that I use for a
more natural look it really depends on
the amount of discoloration that's in
your skin because you're going to want
to use your concealer first or some
people use it after it's really what's
best for you and then throw your
foundation on but some foundations that
I use because I have normal skin I don't
have acne I don't have scarring things
like that these are things that work for
me personally and then we'll go into the
collective brain and see what works for
them so one thing that I do a lot is
using a powder foundation especially if
I'm in a hurry because it cuts off the
step of a powder unfortunately they
don't last super long so this is
something I need to throw in my purse
now this one I'm just trying this one I
have only used once and i've only used
it over foundation i just want to show
it to you anyway because i did like it
over top of foundation this is the bare
minerals bear pro i got this for free at
generation beauty from the bare minerals
booth and anybody that went to
generation beauty that stood in the line
for bare minerals got one of these one
that is tried and true is the two-faced
cocoa powder foundation it does smell
like chocolate so if you don't like that
you won't like this but it just gives a
really nice very light coverage to the
skin and also cuts out that powder step
but again lasting power is not great so
you want to put it in your purse for the
day thankfully it's got a really nice
hard packaging the magnetic loot is it
magnetic no it's a snap closure but the
snap closure is very very strong I've
never had a problem with it so as far as
actual foundations Oh old reliable of
mine that I absolutely love is the
Garnier BB cream my shade is in light
medium I love this one for giving just
enough coverage so that my skin still
looks super super natural I really love
that really love this a lot and it's not
it real super expensive either so that's
really really nice it's so funny all my
stuff is drugstore what is this
sometimes drugstores just really good
that's just what it is and the cat says
if you have acne BB cream still looks
great fantastic
great to know and Michelle says it
cosmetics CC is my go-to natural
foundation I have the Academy xec I have
it in medium it's too yellow for me but
I liked it when I used it um I liked it
when I used it but I can't really use it
because it's really the wrong color for
me it makes me look weird so daniel says
it's been over a month since i've been
in chad welcome back Daniel I appreciate
you being here Julie says the winky luxe
powder well from the FC bag has a
wonderful finish and I absolutely agree
with that that was wonderful and if you
um even if you don't subscribe to epsy
you might be able to get the Ipsy deals
i don't know maybe not maybe you have to
be subscribed epsy but i'm pretty sure
there's a discount code a twinkie looks
right now um takai says I've tried the
garni but it runs too dark for me oh no
oh man her Mimi says she loves the
Porefessional that's good to know yeah
covergirl BB matt is good to Monica says
Caroline says she hasn't found a good BB
cream yet another one that people don't
talk about much as the l'oreal visible
lift blur foundation this one's really
really nice gives a beautiful like
sateen trying to finish it's very
natural looking looks really really good
I've had this for a while I'm hoping
it's still available the only thing i
don't like about this it's kind of weird
how like the bottle and you can see
through it and see the product inside i
mean i guess that's a good thing to be
able to know how much product you have
left but i don't know just it's weird
for a squeezy to be able to see through
i don't know what bothers me it's kind
of weird and then the other one that i
really like this one says that it's a
soft matte foundation this is the drain
velvet soft matte hydrating foundation
and i have number 60 sandy beige my
L'Oreal visible lift is in preemie
natural but I really like this one as
well I feel like it gives a really nice
very natural finish another one that I
bring up all the time with you want
Subaru light coverage surah light is the
josie maran argan daily moisturizer
protect and perfect that I talk about
all the time I brought that out cuz i
was only thing high end and I had that I
thought was appropriate for this
category because most of the high end
stuff that i have is not natural looking
like at all it makes you look like it's
very it's more full coverage not that's
a bad thing but but doesn't go with the
topic so i'm going to go ahead and
consoled the collective brain for
foundations
let's see my mom has dry mature skin and
loves the visible lift Aspen says
Brittany says I love BB creams I prefer
them for my work days because I don't
have that bad of skin it just evens out
my tongue without being so thick yes
that's what we're talking about today
Caroline says I want to try the elf the
elf moisture stick that I talk about all
the time I feel like is a little bit
more full coverage so if you're looking
for that more full coverage the elf
moisturizing stick if you can get your
hands on it is stinking amazing but
that's the only elf one that I've tried
that I liked Florrie says it cosmetics
my holy grail but I just got to Laurie
else I hope it's a good do and then
carolyn says the acne elf foundation is
really good that's good to know red
headed for trouble says BB cushions are
the only foundations I wear anymore the
heroine is my favorite interesting very
interesting I'm sakai wants to know if
the Milani is any good I don't owe the
Milani you know what I didn't like the
Milani the Milani three in one everybody
loves that one and I didn't like it I
felt like it didn't look right on my
skin like it looked like it was streaky
to go on for me I don't know it just
wasn't like like I'm like why are people
talk about maybe I got a bad one or
something because everybody seems to
love that Milani three-in-one foundation
I did not like it I end up getting rid
of it because it just wasn't good for me
I've also gotten a bad one or something
because or I'm like a freak of nature
because everybody loves that Milani
foundation michelle says the bare
minerals complexion rescue works great
for me and emily says the l'oreal lumi
cushion is really nice and really
natural and you know what i found that
two about the loonie cushion the limit
cushion just makes me angry and that you
get such little product and like you
have to flip the sponge over and um it
doesn't last a super long time on me but
it is beautiful like off the bat it's
beautiful anna says tati raves about it
i'm thinking what am i missing yeah i
don't know for some reason it just
doesn't work for me megas s Lonnie three
and one is so yellow I look like a
couple impa and I had that problem too
with them with that meg and I had the
exact same problem um yeah so I don't
know and Julie says talking loves the
Milani but it doesnt sit well my skin it
doesnt sit well
my skin either I feel like like there's
something wrong with me do you ever do
that we were watching a YouTube video
and there's your favorite youtubers like
raving about something and it's like
don't like that product products doesn't
work for me and you feel like is there
something wrong with me because they
love it and I don't like what is going
on here so um so yeah but anyway that's
kind of the way that I felt about it Jen
from indicating one says as far as the
Milani goes maybe you were the honest
non bandwagon reviewer you know I love
taki though like I'm not gonna I don't
know I mean I I trust tati I do I have
to say I do and I no not at all my
viewers love tati but I personally do
and you can't make me not love her only
she can make me not love her and she's
been awesome so far alright moving on
moving on Florrie says she's not a fan
of cushion foundations either and I
think that it's also the application
with a cushion foundation as well anna
says Make Up For Ever water bland looks
great on the skin if you don't want need
much coverage carolyn says i love the
Urban Decay all night all nighter yeah
the not all nighter I heard that one's
pretty thick though steph's has lots of
stuff post-orange on her and catherine
says Tottie's great i love her all right
let's move on to eyeshadow natural eye
shadows so I have some drug store
options first some things that I
personally really love I wasn't going to
bring this out but I saw it at all to
the other day that they're still selling
it this is the NYX the to go palette
lapel it indispensable and it comes with
six eyeshadows a highlight a blush and a
bronzer now I'm really bringing this out
for the eye shadows shadows are pretty
awesome the bronzer is mmm the blush is
pretty good the highlights pretty good
I'm not as big of a fan of the bronzer
um it's just I don't know it's kind of
orange and I don't know it's just not
it's very warm toned and I don't know I
haven't no see it looks pretty on my
hands now I'm thinking like what I have
in my head may not be what you ever do
that like you try something you looked
at like oh I don't like that and you try
it in this like wait a second maybe I do
like um but yeah I mean I remember
trying this and saying
didn't like the bronzer but I like the
blush I like the highlight especially
like the eyeshadows and I love the color
combination here I absolutely love the
color combination let me see if I can
swatching these for you they are so
incredibly creamy like they feel like
high-end shadows and this one's a little
bit chunky that one doesn't feel quite
as good I got five fingers and six
shadows what is up here all right they
just feel like high-end shadows one more
they feel super creamy their opaque
they're easy to blend like I don't know
why mix doesn't make all their shadows
like this because some Nick shadows are
pretty stinkin terrible this one's
probably the most powdery but they're
really good they're great on the eyes
they're really nice and of course this
is a very coral blush and I how much
your don't want that this season because
people typically shy away from corals
but yeah this one's fantastic if you can
get your hands on this it's wonderful I
think there's a couple of them there
might be once for different um for
different skin tones but I'm not sure
I'm pretty sure there's more than one
though crystal says yes that nyx I had
that palette I gotta give that a
shout-out yes definitely Stevie's girl
says that nyx BB cream works good too
for natural that evens my skin tone very
good big pans on the next yeah they are
nice size pans let me see how big they
are does it say on here it should it is
tap base though so just warning if you
don't like tap you're not going to like
this don't get it if you don't like Coke
and the blush has aluminum starch so
some people don't like aluminum you're
not going to like this either I was
trying to find the sizes and I don't see
them oh here we go I shadows are point
zero five ounces and the highlighter and
blushed or points your age that's a nice
size that's a decent size alright let me
get my towel here hold on a second my
quick removal of product dear okay then
of course I have to bring out my ELF
palettes these things are so good so
good ones that you can get there a
little more accessible the walking on
eggshells palette is really really good
at to trio and then of course the
well oh no right here the comfort zone
but this one I didn't bring it out
because I don't know if I would say that
this is the best natural palette it's
got some nice natural shades in it like
these three up here but I didn't bring
that one out but I think walking on
eggshells is probably my favorite as far
as the dub the elf pappadeaux that's wet
and wild goodness what and Jen needs to
get more sleep wet and wild walking on
eggshells wet and wild comfort zone but
only for these top three shades elf this
is live girlfriend this is live and
sometimes Jen can't you know I edit
these things out in my favorites else
goodness all right here we go let's go
for some elf elf mad format this one's
really really nice if you love matte
eyeshadows I think these are ten dollars
in the elf website I've never seen them
in store but I've heard you can find
these in some stores excuse the
fingerprints on the top this is
wonderful especially a matte eyeshadow
palette like this at the drugstore like
what's what this one's my favorite
though the the one that's the needed
nude and I love the color range the
color range is so nice you've got some
really light ones some medium ones and
some deep ones I feel like they kind of
overdid it on the deep a little bit I
probably could have done without this
one right here like just give us this
deep one we don't need that one and
maybe throw it in another medium one
instead that's what I would have done if
I were else but um but yeah these elf
ones are fantastic that you have to get
them on the elf website unfortunately
for most people i have heard that you
can't have seen them in stores as far as
higher-end pallets of course i have to
talk about the urban decay naked
palettes these are staples as far as
everybody knows that these are amazing
and if you haven't been around my
channel for a super long time the Urban
Decay Naked 2 is actually part of the
inspiration for this channel in that
when i got the Urban Decay Naked 2 i'd
never tried a high in eyeshadow and when
i used it i was like my makeup looks
look how did I do that and it was
because of the quality the shadows
because I had never used a very high
quality eyeshadow before and the way
they blended it was like oh my gosh are
you serious like I've been living in
Revlon I shadowland my whole life and
was like oh like that the Angels sang
and the Calot was glowing and it was
amazing but yeah I mean this these
pallets are amazing they're they're
famous for a reason there's a reason why
an entire line is naked by urban decay
it's because they are genuinely amazing
genuinely amazing Kelly says she loves
the it naturally pretty palette and i
love it to a lot of people say that
muddies on them I do not think it money
love me if these are not in your budget
I definitely recommend picking up one of
the small naked basics palette I know
that the new naked basics came out and
that one looks amazing I've been
watching some reviews and it looks
fantastic but that may not be in your
budget what I would recommend if you
want one of these pallets is to get the
naked basics to if you like the mat I
like the shade range in this especially
if you were of a deeper skin tone it's
going to give you more options of things
to do I feel like this is kind of a
staple in my personal collection because
what I need a matte shade I know I can
just grab this and I can use this for a
transition and look at look at all these
skin tones you could have a transition
for you know I mean anybody and then you
can also deepen up look so like let's
say you're in a pallet like the
missjenfabulous palette by ulta brand
maybe you're in that paladin you don't
have a deep color well here's your deep
color right here or here you know or
here well no probably not probably this
one over here but you've got deep shades
as well you know so this is just a
really nice oh my gosh emergency i need
a matte eyeshadow and i can't find one
like it's right here it's right here
michelle says she loves the Naked basics
ultimate it really looks amazing it
really looks amazing everybody saying
they love the Naked basics palette
another when people are talking about is
the chocolate bar and I don't know why I
don't know why I didn't have this one
we're already sitting out I think it's
because it was in my little stand there
but the original chocolate bar palette
if you these shades are calling to you
these can create such a butyl
full natural look so incredibly
beautiful and I'm starting to think I
dare to say I'm going to have to do some
ingredient research on the chocolate bar
palette the sweet peach palette the the
bon bons palette and compare them to the
newest two-faced formulas because I dare
to say that they're different because
I'm trying out the holiday sets and
people always say the holiday sets
always suck but like I'm hoping this
isn't a permanent change because I'm
trying out these holidays that's which
review is coming very soon I'm hoping
next week for the grand cafe and then
the one that's exclusive to sephora the
chocolate shop I feel like there's it's
like there's something wrong here like
the there's something going on
especially with the shimmer shades that
they're just not right you know like
when you get something like creme brulee
these satin shades over here and and
then you go into satin shade in the
holiday set and it's like what is this
what is going on here but this is
definitely probably my favorite palette
of all time you can create natural looks
but you can also create more intense
with this as well and it's just really
easy to use and I think that one of
those things that people that buy
drugstore makeup that would encourage
you to think about investing in either
the chocolate bar palette or one of the
naked palettes because of the
frustration factor when you use a lot of
drugstore products you know it takes a
lot to blend it and then when you try
one of these higher and pouts it's like
oh my gosh my life is so easy and you
can still use the drugstore palettes but
those days where you just don't want to
fool with it you just don't want to mess
with it you know it's it's nice to have
that in your back pocket you know even
if it's just one of them um exceptions
being I mean I feel like this definitely
compares to the high-end ones this is
close to high-end but I wouldn't say
it's quite there same thing with the wet
and wild I don't feel like it's quite at
that high end I do feel like the Knicks
really feels like it is though the
Knicks is really really good really good
so yeah I mean I definitely recommend
just investing in one the ball meet
matrimony is awesome Rose says I have
that on order from hautelook rihanna
says I didn't like the chocolate bar the
semi-sweet I know me on
who doesn't let these pallets I would be
curious Brianna why because I'm sure
you're not the only one I'm sure there
are other people and there's I think
it's Carolyn is it Caroline that doesn't
like two-faced there's somebody there's
somebody that I've been talking to in
the past day or two that I know does not
like to face and I think I might be
Caroline um but anyway so oh you know
what maybe it's um okay nevermind that
person is not here so lorac Pro matte do
I have a little rock I don't have a lock
pro Matt I don't have that one sorry but
I what I do have is the lorac mega Pro 3
which is also a really nice option for
natural makeup I use this once once so
far and it's filthy number one but
number two the shadows are amazing and
they're incredibly consistent throughout
very consistent in that the formula is
like when you when you touch one of
these shimmer formulas or the San
formulas and you touch another one
they're the same like I don't know how
they do it yeah it is Carolyn the hips
you Pacey I knew it see I got you I
thought you and the mats are amazing the
mats are amazing um I think this is the
way that these work I feel like I wish
the it cosmetics naturally pretty talent
blended as easily as these blend I would
personally recommend this over the it
and actually pretty if you liked it
naturally pretty you may really like
this a lot because it's kind of similar
in what's going on here but it's it they
blend a lot easier and they don't they
don't go together as easy um they keep
their true color a little bit more but
yes this one's a really good one so far
but i only use it once i'm still going
to review it Felicia says she loves the
chocolate bar palette at Felicia's of a
deeper skin tone just so you know ok so
ladies with deeper skin tone she loves
the chocolate bar palette so and if you
um if I don't know your skin tone and
you have a specific opinion and you have
a different skin tone than me I would
love to to make sure that people
watching a different skin tone
no what works for people of different
skin tones as well because I know
there's a lot of people in here of very
different skin tones medium/deep okay
last one I wanted to talk about was the
the new dude that is on hautelook all
the time um Felicia's has anyone getting
the Anasazi Beverly Hills palette on
Tuesday are you talking about the
release of the mono Renaissance I'd be
curious to know who's getting that as
well Anton Etta says about Cole's at
kills carries cargo do you like cargo
washes his car go wash shadows have not
been good for me I've only tried one
palette from cargo that I liked that's
very interesting um carolyn says the kat
von d didn't calls me i didn't i'm not
getting the kat von d this year either
and that's the first time ever so
pancake says i can please speak to the
girls who were pale AF brianna says she
has fair skin Oh wonderful and
toothpaste semi-sweet for deeper skin as
well from Phil wonderful thank you so
much fil not ph IL let's say i love the
new dude red headed for trouble says
yeah I mean it's got a really nice range
of shades you are going to need a mat
talent to supplement this because these
are all shimmer shades except for I
think this one even that's got a little
bit of a satin finish to it so you are
going to need a matte palette to
supplement this but it's a really nice
classy powers fantastic so there you go
alright so I wanted to move on to
blushes and highlights and contours
let's see Faye says a nightmare trying
to find something that can do can do
pale and freckles oh I'm sure I'm sure
sending one suggestion for super fair as
in albino fair Tiffany Campbell says Jen
do you value can you do value for price
with the palettes not right this second
unfortunately because I would need to do
a lot of looking up and I wouldn't be
able to talk to you for long periods of
time but we could do that or I could
teach you how to how I do it uh Nick who
said I hope I said that right Nick he
says deep skin here awesome fantastic
we'll definitely chime in definitely try
man um megan says i need some new dudes
in my life haha
and it's funny that there's a chick on
the front but then there's naked man on
the inside it's just very funny okay
moving on to blushes now when my blushes
fell but when I reach for a natural
blush for me and my light to medium skin
tone I reach for deep moles I know
that's kind of weird because when when
someone says a natural color and think
that something close to the skin tone
would be beautiful but these are the
shades that I reach for our ones like
this this was in my ride-or-die tag this
is the in skåne blush and the shade
houndstooth this is my its alternative
to Essex by Kat Von D that you can't get
anymore it's just it gives that natural
flush like in from the cold kind of look
to my skin Aspen says I love when you
break down the valley ingredients gensou
help all I'm so glad stay I stay Jones I
can't tell you what a f stands for
because it's a curse word um and I don't
know if there's children listening but
if you um if you type in google as AF
it'll tell you um but anyway so this is
what i use um uh oh today Jones looks
like they were a creeper and I didn't
realize that I fell for it thanks tab
alright anyway this blush is fantastic
lasting power is wonderful but I always
reach for this tone um when I go for
blushes and I would love to know what
everyone else thought thinks about when
they do when they go for blushes as far
as natural blushes there's a NYX blush
and natural that I really really like a
lot but that one's really really light
takai says I really like mom's she has
cool undertones and Kimberly says those
are her favorite blushes as well megan
says I'm super fair to the only thing
that makes me look darker is the amount
of freckles let's see Kat Von D blushes
were the ball they were I don't know why
she doesn't bring them back hey
Charlene's in the house what's up

the becca blushes i might get the
holiday palette yeah
I you know I haven't gone into Becca
blush land I've been deep in the Bekaa
highlight land for a long time but I'm
going into the blush named Michelle says
the Clinique cheek pops are great for
natural books they build really nicely
the clinique cheek pops and I feel like
for me they don't too slowly it takes
too much work for me I got a couple of
them and I ended up taking them back
because I just I I know a lot of people
love them seal of Carolyn such good
clinic cheek pops are good but I like oh
yea or nay Nicole good YouTube channel
um she she said she gave it to her mom
yeah I mean I think some people really
really love it but it wasn't really it
didn't work for me amber says Max Factor

hopefully we'll get more of those in the
skates Wendy says favorite blushes from
bushwa and I gotta bushwa blush who did
I get that from that was from shannon i
believe gave me the bourgeois flash that
i really like me get it where is it
right here I know it's here cuz i use it
the other day where are you oh here it
is this one right here this one's really
nice it's in rose amber it's beautiful I
got too much stuff in my hands here look
at this cute packaging too it's really
pretty just really really pretty and
very buildable see how it's super light
but then you can build it up and build
it up and it's beautiful absolutely
beautiful so Milani blushes Sarah says
I'm willing to get some Milani blushes
oh my goodness cream blushes are very
hit and miss for me very hit miss my
favorite actually surprisingly my
favorite cream blush right now hold on
I'm getting prayer is this one and it's
stupid expensive but I like this one a
lot the lipstick queen Frog Prince it is
so beautiful on the cheeks that's what
it ends up looking like and it's that
maulvi it's very very very very very
natural and it's so pretty and it lasts
all day long it is so beautiful it's
really nice I have a whole review on
this on this line the lips that Queen
Frog Prince fine the blushes
if you especially if you have dry skin I
would imagine this would be nice because
it's got that like an oily base to it
it's really really nice and you see how
subtle that is super super subtle lauren
says essence blushes are amazing very
similar to to face in my opinion I have
one essence blush and it's not natural
it's this one right here but it's really
good it's really really good really good
I got that at generation view last year
i believe all right let's move on and
let's talk about some let's talk about
some bronzers okay so a sable bronzer
that I use that I feel like is very
natural is the hoola bronzer on me I
really like this one a lot I've used it
for years I don't know why I haven't hit
pan on it I use this sometimes instead
of blush it just kind of depends on the
look that I'm going for um sometimes
blush looks nicer sometimes I'll put a
blush over top of it but I'm not one
that does like the bronzer like all over
my face thing I feel like it makes me
look like I haven't washed and I don't
like that I don't like that dirty look
and I think that made the operator error
and maybe me just not knowing how to do
it properly maybe I'm making it too
thick but it just doesn't look right on
my face shape and all that so I just put
a little bit on the cheeks and I really
like this a lot it's really nice it's
very very nice so Julia says I can't
keep up with chat today at all I know oh
my gosh I know seriously but yeah this
one's really really nice is that the
only one I brought out I think that was
the only one I brought out because I'm
like sitting there looking at all my
bronzers like not that one not that one
not that one um to face the original
chocolate one is nice for me I know they
have that one for different skin tones
as well there's deeper ones for deeper
skin tones Mariana or marina says makeup
geeks spell bounds lauren says
Physicians Formula yes I need to break
down and get that stupid butter bronzer
everybody tells you about the stupid
butter bronzer did I just get makeup all
over my face I'm like going like this
I'm goes it's like wait I blushed my
fingers hold on can I just get makeup
all over my face no because I do that
sometimes I'll get swatches on my face
and I'll be like
I shadow on the chin for like half an
hour so nars makes a nice bronzer yes
nars the what is the NARS NARS Laguna is
very very nice it muddies a little bit
on me though unfortunately Olivia says
the chocolate Soleil in the summer and
the milk chocolate in the winter yes let
me get my my palette real quick
two-faced little black book of bronzers
um one thing you have to be careful of
that I'm learning now that i'm looking
into ingredients is when you get these
sets like this that come with a lot of
different products a lot of times they
change the formula for these so you're
not getting the exact same product you
would get is if you would gotten a
single by itself so just warning you
ahead of time I do really like these
products smell so good oh my gosh I open
it and it's like waft of chocolate um
wait summer says butter bronzer for sure
but you can't get it anymore are you
serious don't tell me that don't tell me
that summer you just broke my heart what
are you serious Thank You moderators for
being on point by the way this this this
chat because I fell for the one but you
guys are like rocking them out so fast
that I'm like unable to continue so
Thank You moderators for being so
amazing all right everybody's talking
about how gross that person was
thankfully I missed it alright so milk
chocolate we've got milk chocolate and
we've got chocolate Soleil and then
we've got dark chocolate in here and I'm
just gonna swatch all three so you can
see the difference on my skin tone and
that dark chocolate is really warm
really warm let me see if I could get it
let's put it here milk chocolate I don't
know if you can see there you go uh
Kenzie says we solve some butter
bronzers at Ulta good okay Brianna said
she saw the butter bronzers it at the
grocery store nice well at least it
might be going on its way out though I
think I would imagine it was like a
summer thing they were limited edition
are you serious what is wrong what's
wrong with companies making things
limited edition that are amazing on my
skin tone these actually don't look that
much different but it also it
be that fact that this is just the
little black book of bronzers but this
is the milk chocolate versus the regular
chocolate so this is milk this is
regular and this is dark so you can see
how beautiful that would be on a warm
deep skin to it will be gorgeous but
yeah very nice for natural looks to just
use bronzer instead just a little bit of
bronzer don't don't overdo it when I
trying to get a suntan just you know a
little bit of bronzer on the cheeks very
natural very nice any other bronzer
recommendation before we move on to
highlights Stevie's girl says yes you
can get the butter bronzer physicians
formula Michelle says she got at CVS
recently but it might be on its way out
it might be on its way out so if you
want it i would say get it now see now i
don't want to get it because if well if
i get it for duping once it's gone maybe
like i missed my boner bronzer just like
aha but i have a dupe for you you know
uh uh let's see kelly says i'm so afraid
of bronzer i'm super pale and never been
able to find a bronzer that doesn't make
me look dirty help mmm I'm scared to
bring this one out I'm scared because
it's expensive I can't find it okay I'm
not going to make you sit there while I
look for it but the burberry one the
burberry wanted medium I have a little
mini one that I got in holiday set it's
so nice it's so nice and natural it
really is it's very nice that would be
the one that I would recommend
especially if you can get it in a
holiday set where you can get a bunch of
different things for the price of a
full-size that's what i did i think it
was thirty dollars it's a 40 for the
mini one and then you got a little
lipstick and then a little primer or
something for like 30 bucks totally
worth it totally worth it um so yes
contouring we can go into contouring so
contouring course you guys know I love
my off contour college that's a given
but contouring for me I feel like
contouring is one of those things that
can go
natural real quick real quick but this
one is probably as far as high-end ones
go this one's probably my favorite the
Anastasio one I like it better than the
kat von d and i'll tell you why and it
really has to do with lasting power I
feel like the lasting power the Anasazi
I definitely beats out the kat von d on
my skin I use this middle shade here you
can see this one right here is the one
that I use for contouring it's a little
bit cooler this one's pretty warm this
one's a little deeper and a little warm
but yeah I use this one in the middle
and I really like that one a lot for kat
von d i do have the shade and light and
you guys saw on the show today that um
weird i'm wondering what happened there
ok alright sorry i got distracted for a
second so with the kat von d i use the
center shade here but this one's really
nice as well I actually know what I
think I use this one more than I use
this one but I kind of use both of those
but for deep skin tones there you go
right there right there and now they
have the one in the show that has the
refillable pans so you can take it out
look let's say you have a friend who has
a lighter skin tone or a deeper skin
tone you can take the pan out it's not
right for you and trade with a friend
you know which is kind of nice Olivia
says the Kevin of quang contour palette
is amazing i'm going to talk about that
in a second let me put these up and then
i want to talk about that so i want to
show you the comparison between the two
I mean really and truly if you look at
it these are quite similar this one's
let's see I guess you would compare
these two but this one's deeper than
this one and this one's definitely
deeper than this one so they are
different you are different as far as
the highlights go we've got to matts in
here and then let's see these are all
mats up here but this is a shimmer in
the Anasazi i use this that much i don't
know why i don't know why i haven't used
it much well i haven't I guess I went to
sis contour kit I always pick this up
for contouring i'll pick this up for
highlighting i don't know what count
upon contour cut let me get that out
it's right here this is what happened
with me in the cabinet want on tour book
that I got this was last holiday season
I think I got this all right this is
disgusting on the other side because
it's seen a lot of love you
this I used to be like holy grail status
for contour and for whatever reason
recently it looked like dirt on me and I
don't know why this is a sculpting
powder medium I actually used to own a
full size of it because I got this I
passed that on to my sister-in-law so
she has that now but this is a turn like
dirt on me and I don't understand why oh
my goodness tabatha thank you and and
steph and everybody blocking all these
creepers thank you so much but yeah the
sculpting the sculpting powder has been
I don't know what happened to it why it
got all yucky on me and turned dirt like
it's kind of gray tones but if you have
super school cool cool tone you're super
cool tones skin this may work for you so
yes um Mimi says sleek has my favorite
contour palette as well steph says this
is just one big game of whack-a-mole
that's what I used to say when I was
teaching like pay attention pay
attention pay attention pay attention
pay attention pay attention pay
attention pay attention looks like one
ball so but anyway um list says the
makeup geek contoured great pigmented
and not expensive fantastic um oh nigga
revolution won't let me get that one
that's a good one I have that one right
here are you there it is makeup
revolution when this is probably my
favorite product from makeup revolution
I've had a hit or miss experiences with
their eyeshadows to really like the
contour palette a lot it's very very
nice I use this shade here primarily
because then you see how it gets not a
warm over here I'm going to use the
shame I really like it a lot it's really
nice definitely definitely so yes Nancy
says I use a lot of my contour palette
for eyeshadow on natural days which is
another fantastic fantastic suggestion
there Nancy Thank You Roxanne says she
loved my teaching video thank you so
much um first you have an ice cream
laura says I have heard the new it
cosmetics contour palette is great for
fair skin but I haven't tried it how
does it last what the day it's okay alas
for
a good school work day but it doesn't
last much longer than that if for
lasting power I would definitely
recommend the Anasazi I feel like that
one is definitely the best for lasting
power I would say the makeup revolution
lasts about the same as the Kat Von D
shade and light elastin good six hours
before you start going okay contours
gaun gana doors gone brianna says I've
never actually used a legit contour
powder just use a bronzer it's whatever
works for your skin tone it's whatever
works for you skin tone jay says conte
wine makes me look old really wow I'm
surprised you're probably using the
wrong shade we got to get you the right
shade sandra says why would I need more
than one contour shade um I don't know I
like to have a warm of one that's
slightly warm on one that's slightly
cooler depending on what blush I'm using
and what I shadow look I'm doing
sometimes I do tend to go a little bit
lighter or a little bit warmer I'm a
little lighter a little bit cooler or a
little bit warmer depending on the rest
of the look but then you can just use a
bronzer I mean really and truly like
when you look at like what I own for
makeup please don't take that as role
model status like you don't need all
this stuff the only reason why I have
all this stuff is because of my youtube
channel so please don't think that you
need everything that I have because you
absolutely one hundred percent don't
alright last thing we need to talk about
so we have ten minutes left is highlight
natural highlights yes natural highlight
so in these I know is that is that an
oxymoron natural highlight of course you
have matt highlights you can use for
under-eye setting it'll brighten up your
under-eye they can look very very
natural you can highlight down the
bridge of your nose the middle of your
forehead your chin things like that I
personally don't I will only use a matte
highlight for under my eyes that's the
only place i use it you definitely want
to use your concealer make sure you
don't have dark circles before you
bright in that area though because you
don't want to brighten the darkness you
know what i mean you want to make sure
that that's kind of evened out okay jay
says non touring never heard of it i'm
intrigued youtube youtube has everything
all those strange things everything is
started on instagram i think i don't
know i'm ignorant to that until the
ignorant to that so anyway
Rihanna was to know if I could do a
declutter someday I really need to
girlfriend my drawers are getting full
and it's stupid I don't need to have all
this I definitely need to Monica says i
love the onus tiles complexion
highlights I view on a sales video
coming up this week I'm so excited anna
says Kevin of Quan candlelight is
perfect for everyday yes and that's in
this palette let me get it out because
this is a really nice highlight for more
natural see how it's like it's not super
shiny nice and natural what's the best
for dark circles I personally use the I
like the next dark circle if you it's
got an oily base though so think about
whether you would like that I also like
the the hard candy what's a call the
hard candy the double stick thing i
didn't get out consumers huh I couldn't
think of it hard candy glam a flashlight
that's my other favorite for my dark
circles which I did not cover today um
up kids are back in the house excuse the
noise ok so anyway so that one's a good
one and then the other one I want to
recommend is the hourglass one the
hourglass one gives a little bit more of
a blow but it's not um it's not so much
that accentuates fine lines and wrinkles
and pores and all of that I've seen this
on people with textured skin and it
looks beautiful just gives a really nice
highlight let me go close my door will
click hold on okay so you can see
there's one here also for a little bit
for like medium to deeper skin tones
there's this here red headed for trouble
says i love my becca skin illuminator
sealant I feel like the Becca is kind of
overkill like its kind of crazy like the
way that it's just so glowy all that
Becca stuff I've never tried the Becca
skin illuminator it wait Becca's skill
of mine are they all called Lumineers
hold on a second here hold on a minute
here now they're not summary skin
Perfector 'he's these are crazy so let
me swatch um champagne pop next to these
just you can see the difference in shine
level
so this is not natural and then here's
the hourglass ones and then this is the
Kevin of Quan candlelight so you can see
the difference you can see the
difference so I mean this is this is not
natural is where i'm going with that so
those are the big highlights that i feel
like i want to recommend for the for
natural highlights I want to hear some
things from you all the asian cutie says
Anasazi Beverly Hills highlights to
which I don't own home I met Julia said
that yay or nay Nicole helped her out a
lot what did nicole say she has lots of
nicole has lots of great tips on her
YouTube channel she says she says a
contour is like a shadow bronzer makes
you look tan don't contour with a
bronzer with shimmer if it's too warm or
it looks weird yes great advice nicole
yeah if you're let me let me go into
that just a little bit more so the
difference between a bronzer to contour
if you're not sure is that a bronze are
supposed to warm up the skin kind of
give you a little bit of flush of color
almost like a blush but more of a brown
tone you know give you that almost like
a tannish kind of color to your skin I
kind of deep enough the skin a little
bit where a contour is supposed to
chisel out it's got a totally different
person but purposes supposed to chisel
out your bones is supposed to create a
shadow show that you look like you have
more scope to a more spoke to face so of
course you can contour more places than
right here but that's kind of the point
of it so they have completely different
purposes some people with warm our skin
tones can get away with using bronzers
as a contour but it kind of depends on
how warm the bronzer is because if you
think about I've said this before
hopefully it's not repetitive if you
think about a shadow a shadow has no
warmth it has no coolness it's just
giotto there's no light to give it
warmth or cool it's just a shadow so the
more neutral color you can get typically
leaning on the cooler side for a contour
the more it will make it look like a
real shadow but it really depends on
your skin tone because a shadow off of
my skin tone is going to be different
than a shadow off of someone with a more
warm skin tone so I hope that
sons with any sense but yeah so that's
kind of how that works megan says
favorite highlights are the essence
eyeshadow and snowflake but it's not
natural at all um Larissa says hi Jen of
a big fan which love from the
Philippines hello in the Philippines um
let's see summer says contours great for
creating shadows it's meant to be subtle
exactly it's meant to be subtle coconut
says I'm scared of liquid highlighter
with liquid highlighter one thing you
can do is you can use home second grab a
couple of brushes here and this is the
one that I can find but with liquid Hi
Larry this is I've been trying not these
royal and langnickel um they're the
motor brushes that you can get at
walmart oh my gosh am I in love with
these or what I'm going to have to do an
entire video on these motor brushes
because number one they're gorgeous
number two they work great and number
three they're cheap so this is the royal
and langnickel Stifler brush so if
you're using a cream blush or cream
highlighter and you're a little bit
scared of application use a stippling
brush so the way you find a sibling
brush as you look for these sparse
sparse personals here because we think
about the product is going to pick up on
the bristles so the more bristles you
have the more product you're going to
pick up so when you're dealing with a
cream product as sibling brushes a great
way to get it just where you want it and
blend it soon out slowly because you
don't want a big stripe of cream you
also don't want to blend it away because
cream products can tend to kind of blend
away especially preme highlights
sometimes you can kind of over blend
them and then you don't see them at all
it's like where did it go but he use a
stippling brush you can slowly blend it
out so you can get the perfect amount of
shine or the perfect amount of blush
that you're looking for so elf makes an
excellent stippling brush that one is
super accessible if you see these at
walmart i definitely recommend picking
these up i'm going to do a review of all
of these that i got a generation beauty
because people need to know about these
things they're amazing phil says for a
deeper scan Becca opal liquid and color
pops wisp see those for me are way not
natural but for deeper skin tone they
work for you that's fantastic miss
krueger says she loves the elf simple
brush
goodness what is up with all the
creepers today goodness all right I lisa
says I forgot the colour-pop and come
out with highlighters I'll try that see
if it works better if me then tan I've
been using I can get wisp I have wits
watch me with Wes here's wisp um and it
is a dupe for Rebecca's opal it's just a
cream formula and if you like the powder
oh it's still so creamy there's wisp so
I just put that on with my finger and
then let me show you with a stippling
brush another thing you can do is you
can put it on with your fingers and then
you can um me show you you can put on
with your fingers and then stipple it
out or you can just put it on like that
and stipple it in so do you see how it
just gives a nice subtle glow and then I
can put it back in and then build it up
a little bit more or i can take this one
and i can just kind of blend it out
slowly see I'm saying so this is really
really nice and you can also cat it out
too if you want to Pat it out that works
as well if you really want a subtle glow
you want to dip it in and then Pat it on
especially these this one doesn't seem
to be sibling out as well as some of the
other cream products that I own but yes
these are very very nice i neglect my
color pop highlighters I don't know why
because they are very very nice so
Lauren says I love bekah moonstone she's
of a very fair skin tone opal is too
dark for me works um works as a blush
topper though yeah and like you can see
this one is like it's a more medium tone
highlighter so um yeah Sammy says i love
the NARS concealer and the Urban Decay
but I feel like the NARS has more
pigment and I've been really loving the
shape tape by tart Michelle says what
type of brush is Gemma gravy on i missed
the name they're called motor brushes mo
da they're these neon brushes they have
with us like a soft silicone e handle

talking about something that need was
Steph talking about I don't know what
Steph summit shape tape is great now
that I figure out how to set it properly
yes and and one thing about the shape
tape is that the shape tape the wand is
so soft and comfortable and gigantic
that I feel like I just want to like
slather it on but you only need the
tiniest tiniest little bit summer says i
love the Born This Way concealer it
doesn't suck moisture out of my poor
under eyes nice nice Carolyn set Oh
Karen Karen story says I love to get my
hands on the shape tape my shades and
sold out forever sherry says Mary Lou's
beautifly use it on the lid and the
inner corner all the time also yes
absolutely and you can use shimmery
eyeshadows in a natural look you don't
have to use shimmer eyeshadow is just in
a bold look you just don't want to
overdo it you want to make sure you pair
it with some mats in there to give more
of a natural look do i set the shape
tape i'm sorry your name went too fast
for me to be able to sound it out i do
set it but i don't set it with anything
special at least so far but i don't have
a lot of problems with crusing i have a
little bit of creasing like a little bit
of wrinkles here I don't have a huge
problem of pressing when I do choose to
set a concealer a lot of times I'll use
the Kat Von D shade and light I'll use
this middle shade here or I'll just use
whatever powder I have so like I love my
Milani powder and I'll just take a brush
and concentrate it right under my eyes
to make sure that it's there so anna
says you don't necessarily need to set
the shape tape I'm oily and it doesn't
crease yeah I haven't had a problem with
it either
