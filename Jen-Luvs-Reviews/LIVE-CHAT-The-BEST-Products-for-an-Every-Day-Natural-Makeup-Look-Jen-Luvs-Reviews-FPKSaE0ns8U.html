chat if you're watching me right now I'm
typing into the chat oh oh yes it looks
like it might be working
yay oh okay
all right there we go yay okay let's
jump into it because last week I spent
like four minutes like not knowing what
I was doing so well 20 minutes not
knowing what I was doing and then four
minutes explaining about me not knowing
what I was doing and the dog is coming
in hello dog how are you dog let me get
my coffee so if you hear jingle jangle
and it's my dog's collar let me make
sure my angle looks okay cuz it looks
like it looks fine so today we're gonna
be talking about natural makeup meaning
that it doesn't look like you're wearing
a whole lot of makeup and I thought this
would be a great topic because going
into the winter time people are kind of
going into hibernation
they're kind of like kind of going and
it's getting a little chilly around you
know you may not feel like you want to
go full glam so I thought we were
talking about different products that
work for all different skin tones all
different skin types that are great for
a natural look now I only have one skin
tone
obviously I only have one skin type
obviously so that's where the collective
brain of makeup awesomeness thumbs in
also known as the wet sort of makeup
chat that's scrolling right next to me
these are the people that are here live
if you'd like to join us live we're here
10:00 a.m. on the YouTube channel
typically there's a link under the
YouTube video unfortunately this week I
couldn't get it up I was having some
technical difficulties so I couldn't get
the link up but if somebody has the link
to it and wants to post it in the
comments of what's of a makeup I would
not be opposed to someone doing that
because I didn't get to chant me a
chance to put it underneath the actual
video that is my first of a coffee and
it's like life blog it's so good it's so
good it's french vanilla it's delicious
okay
Nadja brand of makeup awesomeness let's
go back to them so if you are not we
jointly what I was saying is we get
we're here at 10:00 a.m. of not yep
10:00 a.m. Eastern Time is the time that
I am here and depending on your time so
you got to check their time zones you
can always type into Google about the
time zones say convert whatever time you
are CST to est and it'll tell you what
time it'll help you convert it it's
super easy so anyway let me go ahead and
say hello to the collective brain of
makeup awesomeness whenever people are
in my house I would like to greet them
before I move on to talking about other
things so Julia is here Cheyenne is here
Brittany and Tina and Julie I are too
said Julia hi Julia let's see Takei I
think I said that right in Australia I
hope I said that right I think I said
Cheyenne what's up Shane um let's see
lots of people they were all having a
nice conversation early Valerie is in
the house Nikki Roxx am Tabitha's here
Vicky's here
Nancy is here Catherine downing check
out her YouTube channel Shelley is here
Michelle and Sheryl Abby is here she
already said Shelley and will do a
couple more Aspen is here and Carolyn's
here and the gold digger in the house
and Trish and Steph are here alright I'm
gonna go ahead and scroll all the way
down to the bottom to the most recent
comments if I didn't save the look to
you good morning hello hope you are well
so what we need to start with I think is
foundation that's just me one little tip
though which I didn't get out I wish I'd
gotten out but one good tip is let's say
you have a matte foundation and you
don't want to look so flat because
sometimes matte foundations can make you
look like you're not have enough skin I
mean that's just what it comes down to
it gives you that flat look so one thing
you can do is you can add a luminizing
illuminating primer and I'm like trying
to think off the top of my head going on
sorry guys usually I'm more compared to
this
and of course I can't find one right
this second but okay but we'll talk to
the clips to bring about their favorite
luma nating primers so we can actually
get some real information up in this
place so eliminating primer underneath
your mat foundation will help give it a
little more of a natural finish turn
pull you guys down a little bit
oh I know what I didn't do I didn't put
this on the box okay cat's ear
what's up cat what's up Jen alright
there we go that should be better
hopefully
okay so putting that illuminating primer
Kendall really really helped I'm gonna
go ahead and scroll down and see if
there's anybody that's talking about
Becca bat'leth back lip primer is
amazing according to Valerie gross says
she posted the link thank you so much
for us for doing that hello in Puerto
Rico yes happy happy soupy month what
does that mean Steph what does that mean
Becca back lip primer and the mac strobe
cream nice everybody saying the becca
anna says the back of to so that's a
great indication that the becca is
awesome excuse me for a second I had
someone say something mean once that
they thought it was disgusting that I
was like touching my face during the
chat so I try to like go favorite second
Shiseido makes a great illuminating
primer according to Krista Peter Thomas
Roth Cheryl says 24 karat gold Julie
says the city color illuminating primer
at five below if you have a five below
that is mid United States typically over
to the east where they sell city car I
think you can buy it online too anton
etta says lumi by Maybelline Briana says
I just got to try the two-faced rx
primer I don't know if it stands my
foundation but it's very moisturizing I
feel the same way about that primer
definitely definitely carries this is
her first time able to join hello in
Mexico Kat says the hard candy
illuminating drops see we're getting all
this great information from the
collective brain cuz I couldn't think of
a single one I'm just failing right here
but you guys are helping me out and I
appreciate that that's what the
collective brain is all about
Breanna says I just wish that Becca
wasn't so it's
tensive I am totally with you on that
Brianna I'm totally with you okay so
along with your illuminating primer for
your mat foundation you of course don't
want to use an illuminating primer with
an illuminating foundation you can't
I'll just use any old primer for a you
know regular foundation you don't need
an illuminating one so you don't want to
overdo it
there as far as foundations and things
that I use for a more natural look it
really depends on the amount of
discoloration that's in your skin
because you're gonna want to use your
concealer first or some people use it
after it's really what's best for you
and then throw your foundation on but
some foundations that I use because I
have normal skin I don't have acne I
don't have scarring things like that
these are things that work for me
personally and then we'll go into the
collective brain and see what works for
them so one thing that I do a lot is
using a powder foundation especially if
I'm in a hurry because it cuts off the
step of a powder unfortunately they
don't last super long so this is
something I need to throw in my purse
now this one I'm just trying this one I
have I've only used once and I've only
used it over foundation but I just
wanted to show it to you anyway because
I did like it over top of foundation
this is the bare minerals bare Pro I got
this for free at generation Beauty from
the bare minerals booth and anybody that
went to generation Beauty that stood in
the line for bare minerals got one of
these one that is try to ensure was the
Too Faced cocoa powder foundation it
does smell like chocolate so if you
don't like that you won't like this but
it just gives a really nice very light
coverage to the skin and also cuts out
that powder step but again lasting power
is not great so you want to put it in
your purse for the day thankfully it's
got a really nice hard packaging the
magnetic Lewton
is it magnetic no it's a snap closure
but the snap closure is very very strong
I've never had a problem with it so as
far as actual foundations Oh old
reliable of mine that I absolutely love
is a Garnier BB cream my shade is in
late medium I love this one for giving
just enough coverage so that my skin
still looks super super natural I really
love that really love this a lot and
it's not it real super expensive either
so that's really really nice it's so
funny all my stuff is drugstore what is
this sometimes drugstore is just really
that's just what it is and the cat says
if you have acne BB cream still looks
great fantastic great to know and
Michelle says it cosmetics CC is my
go-to natural foundation I have the a
cosmetic CC I have it in medium it's too
yellow for me but I liked it when I used
it I liked it when I used it but I can't
really use it because it's really the
wrong color for me it makes me look
weird so daniel says it's been over a
month since I've been in shad welcome
back Daniel I appreciate you being here
Julie says the Winkie luxe powder from
the FC bag has a wonderful finish and I
absolutely agree with that that was
wonderful and if you um even if you
don't subscribe to FC you might be able
to get the FC deals I don't know maybe
not maybe you have to be subscribed to
Ipsy but I'm pretty sure there's a
discount code at winking looks right now
Takai says I've tried the Garnier but it
runs too dark for me oh no oh man her
Mimi says she loves the Porefessional
that's good to know
yeah Carver girl BB matte is good to
Monica says Carolyn says she hasn't
found a good BB cream yet another one
that people don't talk about much as the
L'Oreal visible lift blur foundation
this one's really really nice gives a
beautiful like sateen time to finish
it's very natural looking looks really
really good I've had this for a while
I'm hoping it's still available you only
thing I don't like about this it's kind
of weird how like the bottle and you can
see through it and see the product
inside I mean I guess that's a good
thing to be able to know how much
product you have left but I don't know I
just it's weird for squeezie to be able
to see through I don't know it bothers
me it's kind of weird and then the other
one that I really like this one says
that it's a soft matte foundation this
is the dream velvet soft matte hydrating
foundation and I have number 60 sandy
beige my L'Oreal visible lift is in
creamy natural but I really like this
one as well I feel like it gives a
really nice very natural finish another
one that I bring up all the time with
you want super light coverage smoother
light is the Josie Maran Argan daily
moisturizer protect and perfect that I
talk about all the time I brought that
out because I was the only thing
high-end that I had that I thought was
appropriate for this category because
most of the high-end stuff that I have
is not natural looking like at all it
makes you look like it's very it's more
full coverage not that's a bad thing but
but does
go with the topic so I'm gonna go ahead
and consoled the collective brain for
foundations let's see my mom has dry
mature skin and loves the visible lift
Aspen says Britney says I love BB creams
I prefer them for my work days because I
don't have that bad of skin it just
evens out my tone without being so thick
yes that's what we're talking about
today Caroline says I want to try the
elf the elf moisture stick that I talk
about all the time I feel like is a
little bit more full coverage so if
you're looking for that more full
coverage the elf moisturizing stick if
you can get your hands on it is stinking
amazing but that's the only elf one that
I've tried that I liked
Florie says it cosmetics my holy grail
but I just got the Loreal so I hope it's
a good do and then Caroline says the
acne elf foundation is really good
that's good to know red headed for
trouble says BB cushions are the only
foundations I wear any more the heroine
is my favorite interesting very
interesting
I'm Takei wants to know if the Milani is
any good I don't owe the Milani you know
what I didn't like the Milani the Milani
three-in-one everybody loves that one
and I didn't like it I felt like it
didn't look right on my skin like it
looked like like it was streaky to go on
for me I don't know it just wasn't like
like I'm like why are people talking
that maybe I got a bad one or something
because everybody seems to love that
Milani three-in-one foundation I did not
like it I ended up getting rid of it
because he just wasn't good for me I've
also gotten a bad one or something
because or I'm like a freak of nature
because everybody loves that Milani
foundation Michele says the bare
minerals complexion rescue works great
for me and Emily says the L'Oreal Lumi
cushion is really nice and really
natural and you know what I found that
too about the loonie cushion the Lumi
cushion just makes me angry and if you
get such little product and like you
have to flip the sponge over and it
doesn't last a super long time on me but
it is beautiful like off the bat it's
beautiful anna says Tati raves about it
I'm thinking what am I missing yeah I
don't know for some reason it just
doesn't work for me Megan says Milani
three and one is so yellow I look like a
couple umpah and I had that problem too
with them with that meg and I had the
exact same problem yeah so I don't know
and Julie says Todd
love's Milani but doesn't sit well my
skin it doesn't sit well on my skin
either I feel like like there's
something wrong with me do you ever do
that we were watching a youtube video
and there's your favorite youtubers like
raving about something and that's like I
don't like that product products doesn't
work for me and you feel like is there
something wrong with me because they
love it and I don't like what is going
on here so um so yeah but anyway that's
kind of the way that I felt about it Jen
from indie Kitty once says as far as the
Milani goes maybe you were the honest
non bandwagon reviewer you know I love
taki though like I'm not gonna I don't
know I mean I I trust Tati I do I have
to say I do and I know not all my
viewers love Tati but I personally do
and you can't make me not love her only
she can make me not love her and she's
been awesome so far alright moving on
moving on Florie says she's not a fan of
cushion foundations either and I think
that it's also the application with a
cushion foundation as well anna says
make up for ever water bland looks great
on the skin if you don't want need much
coverage Carolyn says I love the Urban
Decay all night all nighter yeah the not
all nighter I heard that one's pretty
thick though
Steph's has lots of stuff post orange on
her and Catherine says Tottie's great I
love her all right let's move on to
eyeshadow natural eyeshadows so I have
some drugstore options first some things
that I personally really love I wasn't
going to bring this out but I saw it all
- the other day that they're still
selling it this is the NYX the to go
palette la palette indispensable and it
comes with six eyeshadows a highlight a
blush and a bronzer now I'm really
bringing this out for the eyeshadows
eyeshadows are pretty awesome
the bronzer is mmm the blush is pretty
good the highlights pretty good I'm not
as big of a fan of the bronzer it's just
I don't know it's kind of orange and I
don't know it's just not it's very warm
toned and I don't know I haven't no see
it looks pretty on my hands now I'm
thinking like what I have in my head may
not be what you ever do that like you
try something you looked at like oh I
don't like that and you try it in this
like wait a second maybe I do like
but yeah I mean I I remember trying this
and saying I didn't like the bronzer but
I liked the blush I liked the highlight
I especially liked the eyeshadows and I
love the color combination here I
absolutely love the color combination
let me see if I can swatch them these
for you they are so incredibly creamy
like they feel like high-end shadows and
this one's a little bit chunky that one
doesn't feel quite as good I got five
fingers and six shadows what is up here
all right
they just feel like high-end shadows one
more they feel super creamy they're
opaque they're easy to blend like I
don't know why mix doesn't make all
their shadows like this because some
neck shadows are pretty stinking
terrible this one's probably the most
powdery but they're really good they're
great on the eyes they're really nice
and of course this is a very coral blush
and I how much good I want that this
season because people typically shy away
from corals but yeah this one's
fantastic if you can get your hands on
this it's wonderful I think there's a
couple of them there might be ones for
different for different skin tones but
I'm not sure I'm pretty sure there's
more than one though crystal says yes
that NYX I had that palette I gotta give
that a shout-out yes definitely
Stevie's girl says that NYX BB cream
works good too for natural that evens my
skin tone very good big pans on the next
yeah they are nice sized pans let me see
how big they are does it say on here it
should it is chopped face though so just
warning if you don't like talk you're
not gonna like this don't get it if you
don't like taupe and the blush has
aluminum starch so some people don't
like aluminum you're not going to like
this either I was trying to find the
sizes and I don't see them oh here we go
i shadow czar point zero five ounces and
the highlighter and blush four point
zero eight so that's a nice size that's
a decent size all right let me get my
towel here hold on a second
my quick removal of product here okay
then of course I have to bring out my
ELF pallets these things are so good so
good ones that you can get they're a
little more accessible the walking on
eggshells palette is really really good
at two trio and then of course
be right here the comfort zone but this
one I didn't bring it out because I
don't know if I would say that this is
the best natural palate
it's got some nice natural shades in it
like these three up here but I didn't
bring that one out but I think walking
on eggshells is probably my favorite as
far as the the the elf pepper though
that's wet and wild
goodness what and Jen needs to get more
sleep wet-and-wild walking on eggshells
wet-and-wild comfort zone but only for
these top three shades elf this is live
girlfriend this is live and sometimes
Jen can't you know I edit these things
out in my elf goodness all right here we
go let's go for some elf elf mad format
this one's really really nice if you
love matte eyeshadows I think these are
ten dollars in the elf website I've
never seen them in store but I've heard
you can find these in some stores excuse
the fingerprints on the top but this is
wonderful especially a matte eyeshadow
palette like this at the drugstore like
what's what
this one's my favorite though the the
one that's the needed nude and I love
the color range the color range is so
nice
we've got some really light ones some
medium ones and some deep ones I feel
like they kind of overdid it on the deep
a little bit I probably could have done
without this one right here like just
give us this deep one we don't need that
one and maybe throw it in another medium
one instead that's what I would have
done if I were else but um but yeah
these elf ones are fantastic that you
have to get them on the elf website
unfortunately for most people I have
heard that you can't have seen them in
stores as far as higher-end pallets of
course I have to talk about the urban
decay naked palettes these are staples
as far as everybody knows that these are
amazing
and if you haven't been around my
channel for a super long time the Urban
Decay Naked 2 is actually part of the
inspiration for this channel in that
when I got the Urban Decay Naked 2 I had
never tried a high-end eyeshadow and
when I used it I was like
my makeup looks amazing look how did I
do that and it was because of the
quality the shadows because I had never
used a very high quality eyeshadow
before and the way they blended it was
like oh my gosh are you serious like
I've been living in Revlon on shadow
land my whole life and it was like oh
like that the angels sang and the
cowlick was glowing and it was amazing
but yeah I mean this these pallets are
amazing they're they're famous for a
reason there's a reason why an entire
line is naked by Urban Decay it's
because they are genuinely amazing
genuinely amazing Kelly says she loves
it I'm naturally pretty palette and I
love it too a lot of people say that
muddies on them I do not think it
money's on me if these are not in your
budget I definitely recommend picking up
one of the small naked basics palette I
know that the new Naked basics came out
and that one looks amazing I've been
watching some reviews and it looks
fantastic but that may not be in your
budget what I would recommend if you
want one of these palettes is to get the
Naked basics - if you like the matte I
like the shade range in this especially
if you were of a deeper skin tone it's
gonna give you more options of things to
do I feel like this is kind of a staple
in my personal collection because when I
need a matte shade I know I can just
grab this and I can use this for a
transition and look at look at all these
skin tones you could have a transition
for you know I mean anybody and then you
can also deepen up look so like let's
say you're in a palette like the Miss
Jen fabulous palette by old to brand
maybe you're in that paladin you don't
have a deep color
well here's your deep color right here
or here you know or here well no
probably not probably this one over here
but you've got deep shades as well you
know so this is just a really nice oh my
gosh emergency I need a matte eyeshadow
and I can't find one like it's right
here it's right here Michelle says she
loves the Naked basics ultimate it
really looks amazing it really looks
amazing everybody saying they love the
Naked basics palette another one people
are talking about is the chocolate bar
and I don't know why I don't know why I
didn't have this one we're already
sitting out I think it's because it was
in my little stand there but the
original chocolate bar palette if you
these shades are calling to you these
create such a beautiful natural look so
incredibly beautiful and I'm starting to
think I dared to say I'm gonna have to
do some ingredient research on the
chocolate bar palette the sweet peach
palette the the bon bons palette and
compare them to the newest two-faced
formulas because I dare to say that
they're different because I'm trying out
the holiday sets and people always say
the holiday sets always suck but like
I'm hoping this isn't a permanent change
because I'm trying out these holiday
sets which review is coming very soon
I'm hoping next week for the Grand Cafe
and then the one that's exclusive to
Sephora the chocolate shop I feel like
there's it's like there's something
wrong here like the the there's
something going on especially with the
shimmer shades that they're just not
right you know like when you get
something like creme brulee these satin
shades over here and and then you go
into satin shade in the holiday set and
that's like what is this what is going
on here but this is definitely probably
my favorite palette of all time you can
create natural looks but you can also
create more intense looks with this as
well and it's just really easy to use
and I think that one of those things
that people that buy drugstore makeup
that would encourage you to think about
investing in either the chocolate bar
palette or one of the naked palettes
because of the frustration factor when
you use a lot of drugstore products you
know it takes a lot to blend it and then
when you try one of these higher and
health's it's like oh my gosh my life is
so easy and you can still use the
drugstore palettes but those days where
you just don't want to fool with it you
just don't want to mess with it you know
it's it's nice to have that in your back
pocket you know even if it's just one of
them exceptions being I mean I feel like
this definitely compares to the high-end
ones this is close to high-end but I
wouldn't say it's quite there same thing
with the wet and wild I don't feel like
it's quite at that high-end I do feel
like the NYX really feels like it is
though the NYX is really really good
really good so yeah I mean I definitely
recommend just investing in one the balm
meet matrimony is awesome Rose says I
have that on order from Holt look Briana
says I didn't like the chocolate bar the
semi
sweet I know I'm the only one who
doesn't let these pallets I would be
curious Briana why because I'm sure
you're not the only one I'm sure there
are other people and there's I think
it's Carolyn is it Carolyn that doesn't
like two-faced there's somebody there's
somebody that I've been talking to in
the past day or two that I know does not
like two-faced and I think it might be
Carolyn um but anyway so oh you know
what maybe it's um okay never mind
that person is not here so lorac Pro
matte doom I have a little rap I don't
have a Little Rock Pro matte I don't
have that one sorry but what I do have
is the lorac mega Pro 3 which is also a
really nice option for natural makeup I
use this once once so far and it's
filthy number one but number two the
shadows are amazing and they're
incredibly consistent throughout very
consistent in that the formula is like
when you when you touch one of these
shimmer formulas or these sad formulas
and you touch another one they're the
same with I don't know how they do it
yeah it is Carolina hates you Pacey I
knew it
see I thought you I thought you and the
mats are amazing the mats are amazing um
I think this is the way that these work
I feel like I wish the it cosmetics
naturally pretty Talent blended as
easily as these blend I would personally
recommend this over the it and actually
pretty if you liked it naturally pretty
you may really like this a lot because
it's kind of similar and what's going on
here but it's it they blend a lot easier
and they don't they don't go together as
as easy um they keep their true color a
little bit more but yes this one's a
really good one so far but I only use it
once I'm still going to review it
Felicia says she loves the chocolate bar
palette and Felicia is of a deeper skin
tone just so you know okay so ladies
with deeper skin tones she loves the
chocolate bar palette so and if you um
if I don't know your skin tone and you
have a specific opinion and you have a
different skin tone than me I would love
to to make sure that people watching a
difference
no it works for people of different skin
tones as well because I know there's a
lot of people in here of very different
skin tones medium deep okay last one I
wanted to talk about was the the new
dude that is on HauteLook all the time
Felicia says anyone getting the anasazi
Beverly Hills palette on Tuesday are you
talking about the release of the mana
Renaissance I'd be curious to know who
is getting that as well
Anton Etta says about Cole's Achilles
carries cargo
do you like cargo washes whose cargo I
showed us have not been good for me I've
only tried one pallet from cargo that I
liked that's very interesting
Carolyn says the Kat Von D didn't calls
me I didn't know I'm not getting the Kat
Von D this year either and that's the
first time ever so moon pancake says I
can please speak to the girls who were
pale AF Brianna says she has fair skin
Oh wonderful and to face semi-sweet for
deeper skin as well from Phil wonderful
thank you so much fil not pH I am uh
let's say I love the new dude red headed
for trouble says yeah I mean it's got a
really nice range of shades you are
gonna need on that talent to supplement
this because these are all shimmer
shades except for I think this one even
that's got a little bit of a satin
finish to it so you are gonna need a
matte palette to supplement this but
it's a really nice classy powers
fantastic so there you go
all right so I wanted to move on to
blushes and highlights and contours
Lissy face says at night and they are
trying to find something that can do can
do pale and freckles oh I'm sure I'm
sure
sending one suggestion for super fair as
in albino fair
Tiffany Campbell says Jen do you value
can you do value for price with the
palettes not right this second
unfortunately because I would need to do
a lot of looking up and I wouldn't be
able to talk to you for long periods of
time
but we could do that or I could teach
you how to how I do it uh Nick who said
I hope I said that right Nick he says
deep skin here awesome fantastic will
definitely chime in definitely try men
Megan says I need some new dudes in my
life ha ha
and it's funny that there's a chick on
the front but then there's naked man on
the inside it's just very funny okay
moving on to blushes now one of my
blushes fell but when I reach for a
natural blush from me and my light to
medium skin tone I reach for deep morphs
I know that's kind of weird because when
when someone says a natural color and
think that something closer to the skin
tone would be beautiful but these are
the shades that I reach for are ones
like this this was in my ride-or-die tag
this is the in skÃ¥ne blush and the shade
houndstooth this is my it's alternative
to Essex by Kat Von D that you can't get
anymore
it's just it gives that natural flush
like in from the cold kind of look to my
skin
Aspen says I love when you break down
the bug ingredients Jen so how about all
I'm so glad stay I stay Jones I can't
tell you what AF stands for because it's
a curse word and I don't know if there's
children listening but if you um if you
type in Google as a F it'll tell you but
anyway so this is what I use uh-oh today
Jones looks like they were a creeper and
I didn't realize it I fell for it thanks
tab alright anyway this blush is
fantastic lasting power is wonderful but
I always reach for this tone when I go
for blushes and I would love to know
what everyone else thinks about when
they do when they go for blushes as far
as natural blushes there's a NYX blush
and natural that I really really like a
lot but that one's really really light
Takei says I really like moms
she has cool undertones and Kimberly
says those are her favorite blushes as
well Megan says I'm super fair - the
only thing that makes me look darker is
the amount of freckles
let's see Kat Von D blushes were the
bomb they were I don't know why she
doesn't bring them back hey Charlene's
in the house what's up Charlie
Cheryl says the insane blushes last all
day agree Phil says dark she says for
her dark skin mac Raisin Bran pepper and
NARS Dolce Vita awesome thank you so

Olivia says she loves the two-faced love
flush blushes these are going by really
fast nancy says I need I tend to go to
my oh I lost it Urban Decay Gwen blush

anna says nyx ombre blush the
wet-and-wild original blushes at yes

great for natural days agreed Rose says
I blame you for the new wear the new the
balm blush palette I bought apple
orchard or whatever that is you know I I
hope you love it I hope you love it I
hope you love it because I and I
actually ended up taking that back
trading it on YouTube because it didn't
end up working for me but I know it
works for a lot of people why did you
did I don't think I recommended that one
I hope you love it though I do hope you
love it more than I did because I know
cream those cream blushes can work for a
lot of people so red red on my heads as
I'm home sick from church so I made it
this week hi hi good to see you I don't
know how to pronounce this but we'll
just say del says the bomb frat-boy
is one of my all-time faves Brianna says
I want to try the Becca blushes I might
get the holiday palette yeah I you know
I haven't gone into Becca blush lands
I've been deep in the Becca highlight
land for a long time but I'm going into
the blush now Michelle says the Clinique
cheek pops are great for natural looks
they build really nicely the Clinique
cheek pops and I feel like for me they
don't too slowly it takes too much work
for me I got a couple of them and I
ended up taking them back because I just
I I know a lot of people love them see
luck Carolyn says completely clean cheek
pops are good but I like oh yea or nay
Nicole good YouTube channel she she says
she gave it to her mom yeah I mean I
think some people really really love it
but it wasn't really it didn't work for
me
amber says maxfactor blushes are the
balm for me nice hopefully we'll get
more of those in the States Wendy says
favorite blushes from bushwa and I got a
bushwa blush did I get that from that
was from Shannon I believe gave me the
bourgeois blush that I really like we
get it I know it's where are you oh here
it is
this one right here this one's really
nice it's in Rose amber it's beautiful I
got too much stuff in my hands here look
at this cute packaging too it's really
pretty just really really pretty and
very buildable
see how it's super light but then you
can build it up and build it up and it's
beautiful absolutely beautiful
so Milani blush as Sarah says I'm
willing to get some Milani blushes oh my
goodness cream blushes are very hit and
miss for me very hit miss my favorite
actually surprisingly my favorite cream
blush right now is this one and it's
stupid expensive but I like this one a
lot the lipstick queen frog friends it
is so beautiful on the cheeks
that's what it ends up looking like and
it's that Mavi it's very very very very
very natural and it's so pretty and it
lasts all day long it is so beautiful
it's really nice I have a whole review
on this on this line the lips that Queen
Frog Prince line
the blush is perfect if you especially
if you have dry skin I would imagine
this would be nice because it's got that
like an oily base to it it's really
really nice and you see how subtle that
is super super subtle Lauren says
essence blushes are amazing very similar
to Too Faced in my opinion I have one
essence blush and it's not natural it's
this one right here but it's really good
it's really really good really good I
got that at Generation V last year I
believe all right let's move on and
let's talk about some let's have some
bronzers okay so a sable bronzer that I
use that I feel like is very natural is
the hoola bronzer on me I really like
this one a lot I've used it for years I
don't know why I haven't hit pan on it I
use this sometimes instead of blush it
just kind of depends on the look that
I'm going for
sometimes blush looks nicer sometimes
I'll put a blush over top of it but I'm
not one that does like the bronzer like
all over my face thing I feel like it
makes me look like I haven't washed and
I don't like that that dirty look and I
think that made the operator area and
maybe me just not knowing how to do it
properly maybe I'm making it too thick
but it just doesn't look right on my
face shape and all that so I just put a
little bit on the cheeks and I really
like this a lot it's really nice it's
very very nice so you know Julia says I
can't keep up with chat today at all I
know oh my gosh I know seriously but
yeah this one's really really nice is
that the only one I brought out I think
that was the only one I brought out
because I'm like sitting there looking
at all my bronzers like not that one not
that long not that one Too Faced the
original chocolate one is nice for me I
know they have that one for different
skin tones as well
there's deeper ones for deeper skin
tones Mariana or marina says makeup geek
spellbound Lauren says Physicians
Formula yes I need to break down and get
that stupid butter bronzer everybody
tells me about the stupid butter bronzer
did I just get makeup all over my face
I'm like going like this it's like wait
I had blush on my fingers hold on did I
just get makeup all over my face
no because I do that sometimes I'll get
swatches on my face
and I'll be like eyeshadow on the chin
for like half an hour so NARS makes a
nice bronzer yes NARS the what is the
NARS NARS Laguna is very very nice it
muddies a little bit on me though
unfortunately Olivia says the chocolate
Soleil in the summer and the milk
chocolate in the winter yes let me get
my my palate real quick two-faced little
black book of bronzers one thing you
have to be careful of that I'm learning
now that I'm looking into ingredients is
when you get these sets like this that
come with a lot of different products a
lot of times they change the formula for
these so you're not getting the exact
same product you would get is if you
would gotten the single by itself so
just warning you ahead of time I do
really like these products that's smells
so good oh my gosh I open it and it's
like waft of chocolate wait summer says
butter bronzer for sure but you can't
get it anymore are you serious don't
tell me that just tell me bad summer you
just broke my heart
what are you serious thank you
moderators for being on point by the way
this this this chat because I fell for
the one but you guys are like rocking
them out so fast that I'm like I'm able
to continue so thank you moderators for
being so amazing
alright everybody's talking about how
gross that person was thankfully I
missed it
alright so milk chocolate we've got milk
chocolate and we've got chocolate Soleil
and then we've got dark chocolate in
here and I'm just gonna swatch all three
so you can see the difference on my skin
tone and that dark chocolate is really
warm really warm let me see if I could
get it let's put it here milk chocolate
I don't know if you can see there you go
Kenzie says we sell some butter bronzers
at Ulta good okay Briana says she saw
the butter bronzers it at the grocery
store nice well at least it might be
going on its way out though I think I
would imagine it was like a summer thing
they were limited edition are you
serious what's wrong with companies
making things limited-edition that are
amazing on my skin tone these actually
don't look that much
different but it also it might be that
fact that this is just the little black
book of bronzers but this is the milk
chocolate versus the regular chocolate
so this is milk this is regular and this
is dark so you can see how beautiful
that would be on a warm a deep skin tone
will be gorgeous but yeah very nice for
natural looks to just use bronzer
instead just a little bit of bronzer
don't overdo it we're not trying to get
a suntan just you know a little bit of
bronzer on the cheeks very natural very
nice any other bronzer recommendations
before we move on to highlights
stevie's girl says yes you can get the
butter bronzer Physicians Formula
Michelle says she got at CVS recently
but it might be on its way out it might
be on its way out so if you want it I
would say get it now see now I don't
want to get it because if well if I get
it for duping once it's coming people
like I miss my boy bronzer just like AHA
but I have a dupe for you you know
let's see Cayley says I'm so afraid of
bronzer I'm super pale and never been
able to find a bronzer that doesn't make
me look dirty help I'm scared to bring
this one out I'm scared because it's
expensive there while I look for it with
the Burberry one the Burberry one a
medium I have a little mini one that I
got in holiday set it's so nice it's so
nice and natural
it really is it's very nice that would
be the one that I would recommend
especially if you can get it in a
holiday set where you can get a bunch of
different things for the price of a full
size that's what I did I think it was
$30 at Sephora for the mini one and then
you got a little lipstick and then a
little primer or something for like 30
bucks totally worth it totally worth it
so yes contouring we can go into
contouring so contouring course you guys
know I love my off contour college
that's a given but contouring for me I
feel like contouring is one of the
things that can go not natural real
quick real quick but this one is
probably as far as high-end ones go this
one's probably my favorite the Anastasio
one I like it better than the cat 1d and
I'll tell you why and it really has to
do with lasting power I feel like the
lasting power the Anastacio definitely
beats out the Kat Von D on my skin I use
this middle shade here you can see this
one right here so one that I use for
contouring it's a little bit cooler this
one's pretty warm this one's a little
deeper and a little warm but yeah I use
this one in the middle and I really like
that one a lot for Kat Von D I do have
the shade and light and you guys saw in
the show today that um weird I'm
wondering what happened there okay
alright sorry I got distracted for a
second so with the Kat Von D I use the
center shade here but this one's really
nice as well I actually know what I
think I use this one more than I use
this one but I kind of use both of those
but for deep skin tones there you go
right there right there and now they
have the one in the show that has the
refillable pans so you can take it out
look let's say you have a friend who has
a lighter skin tone or a deeper skin
tone you can take the pan out that's not
right for you and trade with a friend
you know which is kind of nice Olivia
says the Kevin of Kwan contour palette
is amazing I'm gonna talk about that in
a second let me put these up and then I
want to talk about that so I want to
show you the comparison between the two
I mean really and truly if you look at
it these are quite similar
this one's let's see I guess you would
compare these two but this one's deeper
than this one and this one's definitely
deeper than this one so they are
different they are different as far as
the highlights go we've got two mattes
in here and then let's see these are all
mattes up here but this is a shimmer in
the Anasazi I use this that much I don't
know why I don't know why I haven't used
it much well I haven't I guess I when it
says contour kit I always pick this up
for contouring I'll pick this up for
highlighting I don't know what Kevin
Kwan contour count let me get that out
it's right here this is what happened
with me in the Kevin akwonton tour book
that I got this was last holiday season
I think I got this all right this is
disgusting on the other side because
it's seen a lot of love
this I used to be like Holy Grail status
for contour and for whatever reason
recently it looked like dirt on me and I
don't know why this is a sculpting
powder medium I actually used to own a
full-size of it because I got this I
passed that on to my sister-in-law so
she has that now but this is a turn like
dirt on me and I don't understand why oh
my goodness tabatha thank you and and
staff and everybody blocking all these
creepers thank you so much
but yeah the sculpting the sculpting
powder has been I don't know what
happened to it why it got all yucky on
me and turned dirt like it's kind of
gray tones but if you have super school
school tone your supercool tones skin
this may work for you
so yes Mimi says sleek has my favorite
contour palette as well Steph says this
is just one big game of whack-a-mole
that's what I used to say when I was
teaching like pay attention pay
attention pay attention pay attention
pay attention pay attention pay
attention pay attention it's like so
good anyway
um listen the makeup geek contour great
pigmented and not expensive fantastic Oh
nigga revolution won't let me get that
one that's a good one makeup revolution
one this is probably my favorite product
from makeup revolution I've had a
hit-or-miss experiences with their
eyeshadows do you really like the
contour palette a lot it's very very
nice I use this shade here primarily
because then you see how it gets kinda
warm over here I use the shape I really
like it a lot it's really nice
definitely definitely
so yes Nancy says I use a lot of my
contour palettes for eyeshadow on
natural days which is another fantastic
fantastic suggestion there Nancy thank
you Roxanne says she loved my teaching
video thank you so much once you have an
ice cream Lauren says I have heard the
new it cosmetics contour palette is
great for fair skin but I haven't tried
it how does it last about the day it's
okay
it's for a good school workday but it
doesn't last much longer than that if
for lasting power I would definitely
recommend the honest Asya I feel like
that one is definitely the best for
lasting power I would say the makeup
revolution lasts about the same as the
Kat Von D shade + light it'll actually
good six hours before you start going
okay contours gone God doors gone
Rihanna says I've never actually used a
legit contour powder I just use a
bronzer it's whatever works for your
skin tone so whatever works for your
skin tone Jay says contouring makes me
look old really yeah I'm surprised
you're probably using the wrong shade we
got to get you the right shade Sandra
says why would I need more than one
contour shade no I like to have a warm
of one that's slightly warm one one
that's slightly cooler depending on what
blush I'm using and what eyeshadow look
I'm doing sometimes I do let it tend to
go a little bit lighter or a little bit
warmer I'm a little lighter a little bit
cooler or a little bit warmer depending
on the rest of the look but then you can
just use a bronzer I mean really truly
like when you look at like what I own
for makeup please don't take that as
role model status like you don't need
all this stuff the only reason why I
have all this stuff is because of my
youtube channel so please don't think
that you need everything that I have
because you absolutely 100% don't
alright last thing we need to talk about
so we have 10 minutes left is highlight
natural highlights yes natural highlight
so in these I know is that is that an
oxymoron natural highlight of course you
have matte highlights you can use for
under-eye setting it'll brighten up your
under-eye and it can look very very
natural you can highlight down the
bridge of your nose the middle of your
forehead your chin things like that I
personally don't I will only use a matte
highlight for under my eyes that's the
only place I use it you definitely want
to use your concealer make sure you
don't have dark circles before you
bright in that area though because you
don't want to brighten the darkness you
know what I mean you want to make sure
that that's kind of evened out okay
Jay says non touring never heard of it
I'm intrigued YouTube YouTube has
everything all those strange things
everything has started on Instagram I
think I don't know I'm ignorant to that
until they ignorant to that
um so anyway Brianna wants to know if I
could do a declutter someday I really
need to girlfriend my drawers are
getting full and it's stupid I don't
need to have all this I definitely need
to Monica says I left the onus tiles
complexion highlights I'm Fiona Styles
video coming up this week I'm so excited
Anna says Kevin Huong candle light is
perfect for every day yes and that's in
this palette let me get it out because
this is a really nice highlight for more
natural see how it's like it's not super
shiny nice and natural what's the best
for dark circles I personally use the I
like the NYX dark circle if you it's got
an oily base though so think about
whether you would like that I also like
the hard candy
what's a call the hard candy the double
stick thing I didn't get out concealers
mom I couldn't think of it hard candy
glamoflauge light that's my other
favorite for my dark circles which I did
not cover today Oh kids are back in the
house excuse the noise okay so anyway so
that one's a good one and then the other
one I wanted to recommend is the
hourglass one the hourglass one gives a
little bit more of a blow but it's not
it's not so much that it accentuates
fine lines and wrinkles and pores and
all of that I've seen this on people
with textured skin and it looks
beautiful
just gives a really nice highlight let
me go close my door will quit hold on
okay so you can see there's one here
also for a little bit for like medium to
deeper skin tones there's this here red
headed for trouble says I love my Becca
skin illuminator see you look I feel
like the Becca is kind of overkill like
it's kind of crazy like the way that
it's just so glowy all that Becca stuff
I've never tried the Becca skin
illuminator it wait I think they're not
shimmery skin perfectors these are crazy
so let me swatch um champagne pop next
to these
you can see the difference in shine
level so this is not natural and then
here's the hourglass ones and then this
is the Kevin of Kwan candle light so you
can see the difference you can see the
difference so I mean this is this is not
natural is where I'm going with that so
those are the big highlights that I feel
like I want to recommend for the for
natural highlights I want to hear some
things from you all the Asian cutie says
anasazi Beverly Hills highlights - which
I don't own ho and I met Julia said that
yay or nay Nicole helped her out a lot
what did Nicole say she has lots of
Nicole has lots of great tips on her
YouTube channel she says she says
contour is like a shadow bronzer makes
you look tan don't contour with the
bronzer with shimmer if it's too warm or
it looks weird yes great advice Nicole
yeah if you're let me let me go into
that just a little bit more so the
difference between a bronzer on a
contour if you're not sure is that a
bronzer supposed to warm up the skin
kind of give you a little bit of flush
of color almost like a blush but more of
a brown tone you know give me that
almost like a tannish kind of color to
your skin kind of deepen up the skin a
little bit where a contour is supposed
to chisel out it's got a totally
different person but purpose it supposed
to chisel out your bones it's supposed
to create a shadow so that you look like
you have more spoke to a more sculpted
face so of course you can contour more
places than right here but that's kind
of the point of it so they have
completely different purposes some
people with warmer skin tones can get
away with using bronzers as a contour
but it kind of depends on how warm the
bronzer is because if you think about
I've said this before hopefully it's not
repetitive
if you think about a shadow a shadow has
no warmth it has no coolness it's just
Giotto there's no light to give it
warmth or cool it's just a shadow so the
more neutral color you can get typically
leaning on the cooler side for a contour
the more it's it will make it look like
a real shadow but it really depends on
your skin tone because a shadow off of
my skin tone is going to be different
than a shadow off of someone with a more
warm skin tones
so I hope that makes sense but yeah so
that's kind of how that works
Megan says favorite highlights are the
essence I shadow and snowflake but it's
not natural at all
Larissa says hi Jen of a big fan which
left from the Philippines hello in the
Philippines
let's see summer says contour is great
for creating shadows it's meant to be
subtle
exactly it's meant to be subtle
coconut says I'm scared of liquid
highlighter with liquid highlighter one
thing you can do is you can use grab a
couple of brushes here this is the one
that I can find
but with liquid highlighter this is I've
been trying out these royal and
langnickel they're the motor brushes
then you can get at Walmart oh my gosh
am I in love with these or what I'm
going to have to do an entire video on
these motor brushes because number one
they're gorgeous number two they work
great and number three they're cheap so
this is the royal and langnickel
stickler brush so if you're using a
cream blush or cream highlighter and
you're a little bit scared of
application use a stippling brush so the
way you find a stippling brush as you
look for these sparse sparse bristles
here because if you think about the
product is gonna pick up on the bristles
so the more bristles you have the more
product you're gonna pick up so when
you're dealing with a cream product as
simply brush is a great way to get it
just where you want it and blend it out
slowly because you don't want a big
stripe of cream you also don't want to
blend it away because cream products can
tend to kind of blend away especially
cream highlights sometimes you can kind
of over blend them and then you don't
see them at all it's like where did it
go but if you use a stippling brush you
can slowly blend it out so you can get
the perfect amount of shine or the
perfect amount of blush that you're
looking for so elf makes an excellent
stippling brush that one is super
accessible if you see these at Walmart I
definitely recommend picking these up
I'm gonna do a review of all of these
that I got at generation Beauty because
people need to know about these things
they're amazing Phil says for a deeper
scan Becca opal liquid and color pops
wisp see those for me are way not
natural but for a deeper skin tone they
work for you that's fantastic
miss Krueger says she loves the elf
simple bra
Shh goodness what is up with all the
creepers today goodness
alright I leased this as I forgot the
colour-pop but come out with
highlighters I'll try that see what
works better for me than tan I've been
using I can get wisp I have wits wash me
wear list
here's wisp um and it is a dupe for
Rebecca's opal it's just a creamy
formula and if you like the powder
oh it's still so creamy there's wisp so
I just put that on with my finger and
now let me show you with a stippling
brush another thing you can do is you
can put it on with your fingers and then
you can um you should you can put on
with your fingers and then stipple it
out or you can just put it on like that
and stipple it in so do you see how it
just gives a nice subtle glow and then I
can put it back in and then build it up
a little bit more or I can take this one
and I can just kind of blend it out
slowly seeing I'm saying so this is
really really nice and you can also Pat
it out too if you want to Pat it out
that works as well and if you really
want a subtle glow you want to dip it in
and then Pat it on especially least this
one doesn't seem to me sibling out as
well as some of the other cream products
that I own but yes these are very very
nice I neglect my color pop highlighters
I don't know why because they are very
very nice so Lauren says I love Becca
moonstone she's of a very fair skin tone
opal is too dark for me works works as a
blush topper though yeah and like you
can see this one is like it's a more
medium tone highlighter so yeah Sammy
says I love the NARS concealer and the
urban decay but I feel like the NARS has
more pigment and I've been really loving
the shape tape by Tarte Michelle says
what type of brush is Gemma craving I
missed the name they're called motor
brushes mo da they're these neon brushes
they have with us like a soft silicone
II handle and they're at Walmart so yeah
Roxanne says Mary Lou Mary Lou is not
natural we'll talk about Mary Lou next

glitter in it actually I don't like
glitter I just want highlight no it
doesn't have to litter where's Mary Lou
Mary Lou is just shimmer there's no
glitter let me put it we'll put it way
down here because I don't know there's
Mary Lou so it's just shimmer there's no
glare staff is talking about something
that need was Steph talking about I
don't know what Steph summit shape tape
is great now that I figure out how to
set it properly yes and and one thing
about the shape tape is that the shape
tape the wand is so soft and comfortable
and gigantic and I feel like I just want
to like slather it on but you only need
the tiniest tiniest little bit summer
says I love the Born This Way concealer
it doesn't suck moisture out of my poor
under eyes nice nice
Carolyn said Oh Karen Karen sorry says I
love to get my hands on the shape tape
my shades been sold out forever sherry
says Mary Lou's beautiful I use it on
the lid and the inner corner all the
time also yes absolutely and you can use
shimmery eyeshadows in a natural look
you don't have to use shimmery
eyeshadows just in a bold look you just
don't want to overdo it you want to make
sure you pair it with some mattes in
there to give more of a natural look do
I set the shape tape I'm sorry your name
went too fast for me to be able to sound
it out I do set it but I don't set it
with anything special at least so far
but I don't have a lot of problems with
crusing I have a little bit of creasing
like a little bit of wrinkles here I
don't have a huge problem with creasing
when I do choose to set a concealer a
lot of times I'll use the Kat Von D
shade + light I'll use this middle shade
here or I'll just use whatever powder I
have so like I love my Milani powder and
I'll just take a brush and concentrate
it right under my eyes to make sure that
it's there so anna says you don't
necessarily need to set the shape tape
I'm oily and it doesn't crease yeah I
haven't had a problem with it either
