of the makeup chat I just realized that
I'm like all up in your face how's
everybody doing this morning it's so
good to be here in chat on a Sunday
morning the husband and the kid are
running a race this morning well just
the kid is running the race the husband
went for support to go on watch her run
in this fun race and then my son is on
his media entertaining himself so he may
be a looping he doesn't bust in but he
may I just let y'all know because I got
to do the mom and thing first so uh
that's not what we're talking about
today today we're talking about travel
makeup products products that are really
good for travel products that are your
makeup for travel travel season is upon
us okay it is the end of May and as some
kids are already getting out of school
some kids will soon be out of school
some teachers will soon be not working
anymore so we have time for travel if
you guys do not know I am planning a
giant road trip across the country it's
like a big loop more details to come I
am going to be doing some meetups along
the way so keep your eye out for that it
will be doing a full video like a little
short announcement video talking about
to you guys about where I'm going where
I'm probably stopping and getting your
input on where I should stop to do meet
up so pretty excited to get the
community together to hang out they
probably won't be super long meetups
because they're going to be like kind of
on the travelling road and since it's a
family trip I probably shouldn't spend
too much time with you guys but I am
going that we are going to be doing a
few meetups along the way so we're
making a loop we're not going too high
we are going down low so but anyway I'll
tell you about that later so anyway so
that got me thinking about travel and
then it was suggested by my friend
Tiffany her username is Tiffany dawn she
has an awesome YouTube channel and if
you search for Tiffany don't on YouTube
you will be able to find her she does
have a beauty channel but she suggested
that we make the chat about travel
makeup and almost like yeah that's like
a great idea and Ashley was the one that
brought it to my attention and
it's a long little chain of events but
anyway point is we talked about travel
makeup this morning my personal tips and
also we're going to consult the
collective brain of makeup awesomeness
which is also known as the wonderful
people that are over here on my screen
and v chat if you're watching this on
the replay you won't get to see the
people who were talking and Chad but I
will tell you as many of their comments
as possible so that you can benefit from
the era I just stopped for travel makeup
so without further ado I want to go
ahead and say hello to the collective
brain of makeup awesomeness so I am
going to click over there if you are
watching on the replay it's going to
take me just a second to say hello to
them if you wouldn't mind just being
patient for a second and then we will
get into the chat so I'm going to n
scroll all the way up to the top and say
hello to the first people that were here
hello to Kathy hello to Julia hello to
Kyla and Kristen and good morning
helaina yes I think I got that I have to
scooch in because eyes are not
functioning apparently hello Julia good

Kelly hello good morning Tara or a Tara
territory i think it's Tara good morning
to you and jen and the kitty one is in
the halls Amalia is here and Courtney is
here Emily and Flutie back this year
Michelle is here speaking of mood to
hell oh and thing is here alright I'm
going to go ahead and scroll all the way
back down to the bottom if I did not say
hello to you hello to you speaking of of
Michelle and Tabitha I misspoke in the
show today that I said this week tabitha
was the glue
to the show Tabitha's always the glue to
the show it was not an exception this
week she was just especially like sticky
glue this week so I want to thank
Michelle for contributing and everybody
else who contributed this week to the
show it was it got alone a little crazy
for a minute but we got it we worked it
out so how do the things were being the
glue every week not just this week so I
just wanted to clarify that let's go
ahead o Delaney says first time being
live I always watch on the replay super
excited I'm so happy that you're here
keep it real cam i was watching what's
up in makeup and lost track of time one
so glad that you're here my camera is
low okay let me go ahead and check out
and see what's happening let us see if I
can fix this let's see if I can own a
move you guys up a little bit and then
I'm going to push this up a little bit
so that that way I can see how's that
hopefully that is better okay part of
the reason why it was lowes because I
was sitting there going like this trying
to see everything all right I may get my
coffee alright so the first tip that I
have for you for traveling put this over
here push you back I'm a comfy over here
first step back tip I have is to find a
good makeup bag so this is my makeup bag
at my my sister Lamy got this for me
this is a 31 makeup bag I do not sell 31
I'm not promoting anybody but if you
know a woman you probably know someone
that sells 31 at least in my area it's a
multi-level marketing brand they saw all
different kinds of bags this is their
makeup bag and I actually really really
love this I bought quite a few things
from 31 and this is my favorite thing
that I've bought um I love that it has
so many pockets it's got things for
makeup brushes here but I store my
makeup brushes differently when I travel
I usually put mascara and eyeliner and
lip products and things like that in
here I love it there's the different
zipper pockets really the big thing for
me with the travel make a thing that I
need is pockets because I'd like to
organize things i also like this because
it's got it's easily washable you've got
the vinyl you've got the cloth if you
don't have to worry about washing it and
you're getting all messed up I don't
like the ones that are just one big
pouch for travel unless I have multiple
little pouches
but then I still feel like my stuff is
not really protected but we're another
reason why I really like this one is
because it folds up like this and
everything kind of stays in like a roll
and then you can clip here with this
little button here like that and then
also you can clip this I usually go like
this I don't know oops sorry out of
focus I usually go like this and I kind
of clip it like the handle like that so
that it stays closed I don't know if
that's the way you're supposed to do it
but that's the way I do it because the
imagine this thing being on this like
that's how I keep it closed as I kind of
ring it through the one loop before I do
the little buckle but I love this thing
I haven't brought on a plane yet but I
bought brought it on multiple car trips
like New York like New York in New York
and New York that's pretty much the only
place I've travels as I bought it but
it's um you know throw my bag and I feel
like everything stays really nice and
safe in here so that's the biggest I
think most important tip is get yourself
a good makeup bag I don't know how much
this costs because it was a gift to me
but it's pretty fab it's pretty fab and
then they have all the different colors
and stuff you can choose from I'm gonna
flip back over the collective brain just
to say yeah this thing is so amazing kg
isn't it it's really nice Delaney says I
started a beauty channel and super
excited to join such an awesome group
I'm so happy that you are here Delaney
Delaney it says it says Delaney's daily
dose so I'm assuming that that is her
channel as well jenna says can you take
your makeup um carry on for third plane
travel when I have traveled by plane I
try really really hard not to bring any
makeup no makeup in my carry-on I try to
store everything I mean if you're just
going on a short trip and all you have
is a carry-on you have to really be very
conscious of what you're bringing
because of what the liquid rule and all
of that um but I try not to bring any
makeup because one time I did try to do
the whole carry-on thing I don't know
why I don't know what i was thinking
like I didn't really need to bring that
stuff in my carry-on but I don't know I
don't know what was thinking and
appending to leave some stuff at the
person who's checking I had to leave
some things behind and she's like
grabbing like my really nice makeup and
like taking it and like no no no
take that don't take my you know Marc
Jacobs take my L'Oreal look you know
anything like it was like no stop taking
let me decide what you're keeping don't
stink stuff so it's anyway it was pretty
heartbreaking to lose some of my makeup
so you have to be really really really
careful at anything that is liquid you
have to a store in a specific way but
you can look up on the tsa standards and
everything i'm not going to go too much
into what the rules are because they're
easily googleable i want to talk about
some things that aren't easily
googleable so yeah definitely make sure
um you know it Cyr says you don't have
31 in Texas it's not a store it's not a
story it's a multi-level marketing thing
so there are people that sell it like
Avon um you know like it's like one of
those things so if you go to 30 if they
need to spell it out 30 dash one you can
buy them online or you can find somebody
that sells them so um yeah it's really
popular in Maryland and Pennsylvania yes
everybody and their grandma their cells
31 because they're really nice bags
they're really expect so anyway um yeah
so it's not like a store or anything you
can buy it online absolutely um krista
says because she bought so much makeup
at I meds even with me sending her the
liquids in the mail she had so much
makeup it didn't fit on her carry-on
yeah you just have to be like really
conscious of what you're bringing if
you're going on a plane now um speaking
of going on oh and perfume you don't
want to try to bring her fume on a plane
that's not a good idea don't do that
don't do that just let it be let it be
I'm speaking of that I do want to take a
moment to thank on Nancy my friend Nancy
here on YouTube she is a subscriber of
mine she sent me a busy art palette I
want to show you the Vizier kellett she
sent me this is what I'm assuming
happened that she got her Bismarck
pellet and it was broken so they she got
a replacement and then sent me the
original one which I am so incredibly
thankful for I like openness and I was
like she said be a 50 heart belly was
freaking out freaking out like I don't
care that one of the shadows is
completely gone I do not care like I am
so thankful to be able to try these
things like I'm I was
freaking out so thank you so much Nancy
for the busy account that was so
thoughtful of you the reason why I want
to bring this into this video is because
this is what happens when you don't have
an eyeshadow palette stored properly is
things like this can happen if you look
at this palette it's just plastic all
that is classic so you would think that
this would make it safely to its
destination any girlfriend you still
have to make sure you package this
safely my sound is that going oh no
Chris that sees my joke you can bring
solid perfume Lilly says yes that's very
true that's very true um but uh anyway
as you want to make sure what I do with
eyeshadow palettes is I put them in
socks I take a sock and I put it in the
sock and then if it's small enough you
can put it inside a shoe you can do that
with anything this of course would not
fit into a shoe but I could put this
into a sock and then kind of shove this
into like my clothing area to keep it
the sounds not lining up are you serious
okay if it's that bad I will um ok now
we're good on I met yes steph says
please follow tsa rules don't make the
security lines longer please exactly
because not just affecting you it's
affecting everybody behind you that's a
really good point stuff really good
point ok all right if you're having
issues with your connection or if you're
having issues with the sound try going
out and coming back yes thank you spring
okay Sarah says she's fine all right I
don't want it to be an unpleasant
experience watching this especially for
people on the replay so well for the
live viewers to but on the replay is an
hour long to watch this thing all right
i'm indy kitty one Jen says gina 311 is
the role yes you can bring them if they
fit in the bag there you go all right so
anyway mmm I'm a little nervous about
some we I think we might need some
blockage here some blocking miss um
moderators I think there might be
someone done line makeup is just here to
call some trouble all right so anyway so
I wanted to show you what what the
weight difference p I should also like
this violet Voss palette I would never
bring outside of you want to recommend a
few Japanese and Korean products I think
you'll like that would be a good thing
for an email that would be a good thing
for an email since this topic is not
about that definitely email me a gin
those reviews @ gmail.com and I would
love to hear about it it's $25 amalia
says thank you so much thank you step
for hooking that up so this would
shatter and travel there's no way this
thing would make it so I mean it's just
got this cardboard packaging that is not
cool this one however i wouldn't be as
worried about do you see how it's like a
stiff like really stiff cardboard but
just to be safe I would still pack
something like this in a shirt or in a
sock or sweater or something to make
sure that it's good but really and truly
when I have I shadow this is what I
think about I think about I want a
neutral palette and I want a color
palette that's all you need and these
two pilots would be all I would really
need for a trip am I only going to ring
2 palette to know because I'm a makeup
junkie but this would be all i would
need this isn't the Urban Decay Naked to
basics palette this is a fantastic
travel palette it has all of your
neutral shades for your transition for
your blending color for deepening up the
outer corner it's really really really
really nice so definitely recommend this
one this this is a fantastic fantastic
travel pellet if you're planning on um
just packing light the rock probe metal
pellet I don't know if this is still
available or not but this one's really
really good as well for getting those
colored shape them so you know gives you
your bronzes there's a rose gold there's
this champagne II kind of color you've
got this green you've got a bright blue
or black you know I mean this is just a
fantastic fantastic fantastic palette to
have as a companion to the naked too so
really and truly this is your eyeshadow
right here um if you don't wear a color
this is your eyeshadow right here so I
mean you don't you don't need the whole
world and i shot it when it comes down
to it Patricia says she says bubble wrap
for her eye shadows and that so excuse
me that is a really great idea
to use bubble wrap for your eyeshadows
you can save the packaging when you get
all of those wonderful packages that you
get in the mail every day like I do I'm
save some bubble wrap for wrapping your
stuff that's a fantastic fantastic idea
um Samantha says that using Naked basics
to every day and I love it oh it's
fantastic Cheryl says I have to save the
padded mailer bags from when I order
stuff and breakable things put breakable
things in there just layer between
clothes and boom exactly epsy bags the
the perfect perfect excellent job and
yes thank you to everybody on to the
moderators for blocking the trolls I
appreciate you I don't want to talk
about brushes I'm like I mentioned
before I don't have my brushes in there
I say that just for makeup I feel like
this this kind of container is so
perfect for brushes like nothin's
happenin to this nothing nothing's
happening to this I'm the only thing you
have to worry about is it for some
reason it gets shaken upside down really
hard your brushes can be crushed so you
want to try to keep it flat in your bag
but this is my beauty junkies you guys
know I'm addicted to beauty junkies
unfortunately my code no longer works
for beauty junkies but I am such a huge
fan of beauty junkie brushes this came
with one of their brush sets also i have
one from coastal scents that they have
one as well coastal scents and Hugh
junkie set me both of them just so you
know but they're not paying is say this
and I'm not like it has nothing to do
with that I just wanted to show you the
type of container get whatever you like
but these things are so fat they have
two snaps on the side and then inside is
where you store your brushes this is I
would not leave on a trip without one of
these things and there's so much room
for so many brushes and you can you can
easily store whenever brushes you need
in here so yeah so very excited about
that shall tell you about that because I
feel like that's something that really
saves me a lot is having this um one of
these kinds of things how do people even
find the chat like how do they even I
don't know I don't get it I don't get it
Tara says or tar says get idea great
idea stuff you get snacks first no but
that means but I did something good at
school christina says Sedona lace has
one as well as snakes honey says posh
makes great little travel-size dublin
and brush that in its own zipper case
and it's it's it's to the palm of your
hand
another one another company that makes a
really good travel brushroll is ecotools
ego tools makes a great their eye shadow
brush set in the little roll thing is
super fab it's really good but you don't
necessarily need to buy a whole new
brush set you know I mean Gina says if
they took your coat away then well you
know what you're funny um you're funny
all right shed anyway I didn't take my
coat away it just expired because it
only lasted like a month almost says
that more if he has 12 pancake says she
loves ecotools me too Michelle says she
was saying she uses Pringles cam for
travel fantastic but definitely eat the
parentals first I agree and wash it out
you don't want your oils from the
Pringles on your brush even though I
guess Pringles don't have as much oil
with other chips but that's a really
great idea sasha says it elf has a
zippered brush case um that she loves
very nice yeah the Pringles can is a
great idea fantastic idea this is why I
pancake says Pringles kg said think the
worst thing that happened was mary-lou
manizer was broken when I got to my
destination I cried at semi hard yeah
Mary Lou's not gonna make it Mary Lou
it's not gonna make it you got to take
care of Mary Lou oh absolutely
absolutely alright let's see uh oh
charities here she says come one just
woke up I thought I'd miss you it's so
important me a bowl of coffee that's the
way I'm feeling girlfriend I got a
little less than four hours of sleep
last night so I'm totally with you
alright next hit moving on I want to
talk a little bit about foundation
foundation really anything squeezy tubes
are your friend do whatever you can not
to bring glass bottles squeezy tubes are
your friend before you put them before
you pack them give them a little extra
little extra twist no glass bottles if
you can help it squeezy tubes are the
best and for some reason you like let's
say you're going camping and you don't
want to mess with a squeezy to powder
foundation is another option of course
you want to pack this well this is a
two-faced Born This Way Foundation I
love this stuff it's the cocoa powder
for this way I'm sorry to face cocoa
powder foundation not born this way
Sarah says also don't take our glass
that's very true the hourglass um
highlighting palette bad idea
that idea so you can always do a powder
foundation if you don't want to mess
with a liquid foundation because it's
just too messy and goopy and copying you
want something a little faster this will
give you a nice lighter coverage but it
will give you something you know I mean
but definitely squeezy tubes are your
friend krista also says so true spring
becca barely makes it in my drawer don't
bring back up you don't want to bring
anything that is like this without
packing it really really really well
another thing is magnetic closures let
me show you something up with these for
example you look at these in you're like
oh you know they're in these mental
cases they'll be fine but then you
realize that the magnetic closure is
super stinking week these things open up
so easily do not bring these without
having them in something else because
they are going to open um if the right
the wrong fig gets next to it so
definitely being very careful steph says
the ziplock freezer bags of your friend
yeah so this will be a great thing to
put but if in a freezer bag um so
definitely need he's open super easily
specifically those two face palettes any
of those and then sarah says you can
rubberband them absolutely or bow wrap
it absolutely alright dart the cotton
pads are awesome idea yes so another
thing you can do if you want to protect
your on your blush or whatever if it had
a sponge in it you can put a little cut
or even like this this is the new then
you makeup geek blush that I got in my
um my boxy charm you can put a cotton
pad in here a little cotton round to
protect it definitely but just make sure
that it closes all the way cuz this has
this beautiful magnetic closure that was
the reason why I wanted to bring this
out because the magnetic closure on this
is super super strong like I have to
really hit it to get it to open its
really nice another one that has a
really nice magnetic closure is the
Urban Decay afterglow highlighters they
have a really nice highlighter there cyr
says she's his hair ties very good love
that love that presta said i missed it
with preston steelworks over the top to
Julius Julie says that is so stinking
smart all right Krista says you can go
to Sephora
three samples of your favorite
foundations and when you get to your
destination yes good idea Christa
they'll get some look at some sample
sizes absolutely especially if you're
not going to go on too terribly long
just weekend go get some sample sizes or
you know I'm there's got to be some kind
of container little container whatever
you can just pour a little bit into a
kind of like a Sephora container but
yeah great idea Krista well done this is
why i love the collective brain is
because you guys have just as good if
not better ideas and i do so we all get
to learn together which is awesome julia
says I have a palette from crown brush
company called expose that is metal but
also has peg things that lock it tight
very tight nice job o is sahaja here I
didn't know she is she's Sasha there you
go okay &amp;amp; marelli is here too hello
which it says Sasha in her name I
thought that was sahaja but I didn't
want to they want to swim it with sahaja
and she said it's okay my color Sasha
anyway it's interchangeable manali
manele i love you back all right Diana
says reuse those containers from support
or you can buy in bulk if you want to I
do that with my liquid there you go hmm
alright moving on so next thing I wanted
to mention was with perfume if you must
bring perfume I don't know if you have a
separate subscription but said burn
makes those there's travel little
containers or whatever the I couldn't
because I don't travel with them very
often but um but Sanford makes the
little travel atomizer to drop these in
so if you have a separate subscription
of course you're hooked up if you don't
have a separate subscription I know they
sell the little travel o things out like
Marshalls and TJ maxx and all those
places they sell the little um travalo
things definitely are a great way to go
but don't bring them in your carry-on
won't do that um okay all right moving
on Delaney's daily dose if you're going
quick then you can squeeze creams etc
into contact cases I do this for the
beach day trip etc that is such a great
idea such a great idea and Julie says
the
is what I save all the samples for
magazines for nice and because you could
use those samples and they're a lot
easier to carry Christmas says a dollar
tree daily pill container is good for
liquid maybe it might be good and then
you can just wash it out put it in you
know rinse it out real good and then put
it in your dishwasher probably I don't
know if you want makeup in your
dishwasher but you know but that is a
really good idea really smart makeup
mama says dollar tree is the best place
to get travel bottles sahaja says a lot
of times I take an atomizer or else I
take a ton of samples perfume or
whatever yeah it could take the little
ones oh we got we got'em the moderators
got them all right amber says I take my
mua I shadow palette so cheap so it's
fine if they break and they're
impossible to open yeah that's really
good good morning Kristen game how are
you I'm two videos into my collaboration
with Kristen game two videos in I'm
excited we're doing for lux one pallet I
have two of them films I'm gonna film
the third look today and I don't know
what I'm gonna do the fourth look at
Linda be monday and that's gonna have to
be monday the supposed to go up ok so
we're talk about travel makeup products
kristen so any of your tips would be
much appreciated i know that you have
done quite a bit of trouble Cathy says
Sephora Sun safety kits lots of samples
great for travel get it every man should
be out soon it might actually be already
out maybe I think I might have seen it
Delaney says how do you pack your
Beautyblender always struggle with how
to pack that I don't bring my Beauty
Blender the Beauty Blender is too high
maintenance for me for travel if I do
pack it I just I just throw it in here
and one thing I um one of the pocket i
use for it this one here this middle one
right here is where I put my fake lashes
and I put my Beauty Blender in this
middle pocket right here up Kristen's
definitely talking about those contact
lens holder she uses them for skincare
very good very good Katherine says this
has helped for me going to the Florida
nice and Diana says I picked my perfume
samples from sephora i think i got told
things so getting the little samples
from sephora and taking them with steph
says what about the pill separator thing
yes my tryout but is a thought that was
what Krista was saying great idea Cheryl
says I put my beauty blender in an empty
pill bottle that's a good idea to kind
of squishy
in there like those bigger fatter ones
yeah that's a great idea and Valerie
says she puts her beauty blender in an
easter egg it's one of those obvious for
genius things that I never would have
thought of like who would thing to put
their beauty blender in an easter egg
what's what and if you celebrate easter
and you have lots of little kids you
probably have some Easter eggs stored in
your storage for Easter egg hunts for
every year you know do the same I know
stuff like mind blown I know right like
really like what and then nicole says
awesome i get with the easter egg that
way it won't get squished there you go
mind blown mind blown you did it we're
all like okay chats ever we're good
we're done we've learned we've learned
it all at this point oh my gosh valor
batteries the queen of that stuff the
other is my my um she's got great ideas
she helps me out a lot and says I love
your channel thanks for these travel
ideas it's not me man is the community I
only had a handful there they're rocking
it today um alright let's see ok so what
L said I want to tell you about
traveling with stuff I know there were
other things um just I think the biggest
thing also especially if you're short on
space is definitely making sure you're
only taking what you need and not just
every baby like I have so much trouble
packing my makeup because it's like
they're like my children my makeup is
like my children spring says drop them
like Easter Egg drill the hole would
went in there you go there you go all
right oh yeah so it can breathe that's
really smart that's really smart all
right so anyway so I want to bring every
single thing because like I can't live
without this I can't live without this
but you really don't need everything
really and truly so um so anyway Oh
couple off-topic things how it just says
a beaut um put put your headphones in an
old altoids case always saves them nice
job that Catherine says also to gem but
you have been proud of me i put lashes
on videos and rock them yeah good job
Catherine I am proud of you can see says
finally found the
he's girl I Leonard nice nice nice and
then steph says OMG you should make a
video for this gents there's so many
jump there are so many gems there are
like maybe well because this is kind of
video for it like i feel kind of weird
like doing this video and then doing the
exact same video i guess it could be
like a shorter version um what else was
I going to tell you oh I wanted to tell
you this jewelry since we got off topic
for a second this jewelry trick this
worked really well I looked up packing
tax or whatever this worked really well
so yeah old or whatever like you know
and it's just like oh my gosh like I
mean you can't you take enough this out
and they're just a hot ass this is what
you take bendy straws and you put your
necklaces in the bendy straws and then
they don't get tangled so worked so well
so well so yes so I just want to show
you that one because I'm pretty excited
about that that worked very well so um
yep any kind of straw really Alma says
I'll i always say my dogs and my kids
but jen says make up like my kids oh
absolutely oh my gosh makeup is my kids
there with my babies I love my makeup I
do I love it all that's why I hate
decluttering videos so yes Kristin says
so smart well good day for me to break
play hooky from church all yes i love
the bendy straws like in the sake of it
worked it totally worked i'm so excited
about it so like now I like zip through
that so fast I'm like wow what else do I
talk about at this point Oh another like
no like don't do this do not bring loose
powder don't bring loose powder anything
ever ever ever no matter how much you
want to don't bring those I shadows
don't bring loose this don't bring loose
powder at all I don't trust it I like
weird things happen in a suitcase it's
kind of like you know when you have a
bunch of cords and you know how in the
world will even get tangled because I
don't think I could do that on purpose
tangling all those like I don't know how
in the world like something's gonna hit
against this enough times that it's
going to open up by itself I don't know
but it is gonna happen and you're gonna
have stuff everywhere so don't don't
have any powers if your mom
pack a powder put in a ziploc bag by
itself yeah it seems to explode I don't
even know I don't even know Oh deep was
leaving to go to dinner by deepa have a
good rest of your evening Kenisha says
um but my bare minerals pure gold I know
but if you have to bring it you have to
bring up but definitely bring it in on
and its own back by itself Sarah says
multitasking products they're they're
the best I was like der Lyn so i can
have options for eyeliner browser
neutral palette yes exactly that was
another thing on convention is a multi
tasking products so you're really short
on space free and blushes that you can
use also for lipstick or lip sticks that
you can also use for blush things like
that eyeshadows that you can use as
highlighters you know there's there's
lots of products you can use as
multitasking kinds of things by deepa
Cheryl's tongue that pouring powder in a
ziploc bag oh no it's really messy to me
I don't trust my zip locks that much as
she says all-in-one palettes are great
too that's true like if you have a
palette that has everything you need in
it that you can really get a complete
look out of it you may just need that
one palette uh let's see so I just says
I use a small sample box through loose
powders that's a good idea Delaney says
Smashbox master class 3 has I shadows
blushes contours in its heavy duty yes
and Kristin says I use lots of ziplock
so you snack size baggies for each pair
of earrings and keeps them safe good
idea and Michelle says yes all inland
palettes Erica says I normally take my
comfort zone palette I know I'll love my
look and if it breaks it's only five
dollars yes when wild comfort zone is a
great go-to palette just make sure you
pack it well because it's one of those
that has that really thin plastic
packaging that it will break if you
don't um pancake says color pop would be
a solid they don't count mascara as a
liquid I did read that they don't count
mascara as a liquid but lip liquid
lipsticks I would imagine would be
counted as a lips as a liquid Nellie
says emilynoel83 just did a video in
all-in-one palettes nice off to check
that out michelle says I use pill boxes
for smaller earrings and other small
items great idea Elena the chocolate
bars are good for traveling just make
sure it won't open exactly I feel the
same way yes i'm a leo says emily all
did a video about multitasking pelts and
i haven't washed it yet
Catherine Downey says the new Alta
palette that comes with six is 1650
purchase comes with a lot yes definitely
Julie says press and seal your necklace
is individually to and sahaja says
jewelry rolls love them save my jewelry
so many times so my suggestions for
pallets were definitely the naked to
basics and then lorac Pro metal pellet
those were my two suggestions Jenna
Michelle says the Ulta hello beautiful
palette is awesome and cam says I use
buttons to keep my earrings paired
what's what's genius absolutely genius
jeeeesus duct tape we got 30 minutes
left girlfriend and I just zip through
all my tips so this is what we're going
to do I'm gonna get my film because I
did open up a few websites but backup in
case I ran out of things to talk about
because I went like super duper uber
fast um makeup mama says a smaller Kat
Von D pallets will be good to hello
Ellie how are you Michelle's like
buttons genius I have to leave out the
other word just until for the first of
July and then i can say words like that
andrew says um i can can't travel with
any becca products because they always
shattered somebody needs to make
otterbox cases rebecca pressed powders
so one was mentioned that before Andrew
I didn't realize it was that bad i'm
definitely not bringing my back on my
travels oh my goodness definitely not
Abby says I'm bringing pressed powder
and a compact I always put a cotton
round on top of the powder and snap the
clothes he's my powders from breaking
yes if you can um dr. Fox for makeup I
know right um if you can if you can get
it to close with that pad in there you
are good to go one thing that they were
saying a lot on these websites was on a
plane making sure you have lip balm and
anything to hydrate you so they were
saying you know dentally keeping a lip
balm in your pocket and they're talking
about bringing like cuddly Beauty elixir
things like that things to hydrate your
skin because a plane can be extremely
neat drawing Michelle what's known in
otter boxes you're probably not the only
one and otter boxes one of those like
indestructible phone cases I used to
have one on my phone I don't have one
anymore but it's like hardcore like it
snaps on both sides and it's got a cover
on it and
like guaranteed for life and there it's
basically like instructable so sing you
need something like that for Becca so I
know Gina lots of gems being dropped
today yes okay so let me sing okay this
part has no pulse it says swipe
deodorant on your face what what swipe
your deodorant clean and then uh then
swipe it over spots you're likely to
sweat on your face oh that makes me
nervous the ingredients to keep your
underarms from sweating will work the
same way on your face just don't do this
step every day since you could break out
then apply moisturizer and makeup over
top as per usual oh that sounds scary oh
my gosh jenny says I bring a cheap sheet
mask for hydrating when I get off the
plane and the hotel a lot of people were
saying on the there were quite a few
people on these these articles were
saying they do the sheet masks on the
plane I can't even imagine I can't
imagine putting deodorant on my face I
cannot imagine putting a mask on a plane
like I'm like she matters anyway but
definitely not on a plane but to each
her own and I will not judge if you wear
sheet masks on a plane that I'm on I
will not judge you you do your thing but
oh my gosh deodorant face um okay
they're saying cetaphil this is this is
cosmopolitan com apply a heavy
moisturizer than what you would normally
wear the night before you travel this
increases your skin hydration before the
effects of road trippin dehydrated they
say the cetaphil moisturizing cream is
good okay enlist invest choding a travel
mess like the elf mineral missed eight
dollars helps the skin from dehydrating
and keeps you from globbing on
moisturizer when you actually need when
you real more moisture than you actually
need when you wrote you realize your
skin is flaky so there you go i'm julia
says it's a spray that dries instantly i
don't know which one the degree quit you
put on your face julia the new degree
quick stuff oh my gosh really oh my gosh
Oh Diana says put earrings in a belt and
belt holes that's smart too chris has a
lot of youtubers city put on overnight
hydrating mask on planes yeah Jenny says
I'm gonna wait to put that sheet mask on
privacy my hotel room yeah me too me too
Malia's tried to problem-solve here um
so anyway I'm gonna go ahead oh and
they're talking about on using instead
of bringing a liquid a cleanser to use
oil free cleansing wipes I personally
feel like I need a cleanser like I don't
feel like like cleansing wipes do enough
for me I don't know why like I know that
the makeup all comes off but there's
something about using a cleanser and
then washing it off that makes me feel
better I don't know I don't know the
trimet nail polish that that don't use
bright polish on your nails like mine I
have had this nail polish on for like
two weeks and it's like it looks like
doodoo so it's really important to if
you don't if you don't kit if you care
about that stuff definitely staying away
from bright nail polish and using nude
nail polish because it won't look as
creepy if it starts shipping one thing I
really like is I like me let me show you
30 I'll polish these right here are
awesome these are the look fresh nail
polish remover acetone free wipes these
things are so amazing i've been using
these for years i have a nail stamping
video and that these are this is what I
use for nail stamping to like clean off
my my nail Stamper and I clean off my
plate with these things are amazing for
taking off nail polish so packing a
couple of these and i usually bring like
a couple of these and i bring on like
two bottles of nail polish so i have a
choice but that's just me that's just me
but but no no nail polish is probably a
better idea especially for a longer trip
my longer trip I don't know if I'm going
to bring nail polish I can't imagine not
having my nails painted for three weeks
oh my gosh I need to think about that
like I'm really sad in my heart right
now I'm sad in my heart I got these off
the website Allah fresh website um and
they sell them in like a big huge box
but totally worth it for me you can also
sometimes get these at birchbox calm and
they're birchbox shop they have seen
them there before um where else but I've
never seen them in stores but it's
really really really good really good
quality product Kristin says I'll write
them off to get ready maybe film and get
up a bonus Sunday hall happy sunday by
Christine game thanks for dropping by
julia says I wanted to bacha mess for
the plane did you guys see that you baka
masked lady totally off topic but that
pretty awesome all right hand sanitizer
carry on dry shampoo I would never spray
dry shampoo on a plane I'm not trying to
gasp out the whole plane that's not a
good idea for me maybe after bait it
says um miniature wants like the O's on
full detox rub out travel dry cleansing
spray $13 works perfectly because
they're TSA approved interesting but
yeah I love I like look fresh I like
them as a brand amazing house and that's
and that need for that um just use your
flat iron as a regular iron that's
interesting I would imagine that would
be I guess you just sandwich it hugs
that Kristin by Delaney says on bobby
pins to tic-tac container and and q-tips
in an empty advil bottle oh wow bobby
pins in a tic tac container and q-tips
in an empty advil bottle learning so
much today so much day this is like just
as much for me it's for everybody else
I'm learning so much this is awesome
gaddy's is 2 ounce when replenishing
treatment spray is great for hydrating
the skin face in here during a flight
excellent and then Amalia says something
about Cole's I missed it they'll afresh
you can stretch ala fresh pad I saw that
the force fold up you can stretch all
the fresh pad to tune to to both hands
but it's a little bit of a stretch
didn't be completely honest especially
if you have like a really bright or dark
like a blue or something you're probably
going to need to look for like a nude
nail polish you can you can Nick go to
two hands let me see where was that one
Amalia says Cole's went to her house oh
she's talking about that about the the
Chewbacca masks lady the coals went to
her house and gave one to everyone in
the family if you haven't seen the
Chewbacca masks lady it's it's really
good it's a funny video ok makeup mama
says I saw iiy where you cut sponges and
put them in a mason jar and pour nail
polish remover in and you stick your
fingers in the jar and it takes off your
nail polish I don't know I thought it
was neat it sounds like though it's like
the ones that you can like I brought
this was this was a big mistake of mine
don't do this ok i don't have the one
that I had oh no no the also i have had
the older brand wanted since for brand
wad but
the ones where they have the sponges on
the inside I brought one with me
everywhere I got nail polish remover all
inside that plastic bag everything that
was inside the plastic bag that had my
nail polish remover and that exploded it
was all ruined it was all ruined so do
not bring them to remember like this
really bad idea I always horrible I
don't know if that would work with your
idea but with this one this was really
bad not this one but the Ulta brand i
had the older brand white container it's
like a white tub and you stick your
fingers in the sponge well yeah don't do
that don't do that it's bad idea cuz I
learned from my learn from my mistake go
do that Sam's honey says get a bulk
order of the animal sheet mask and hand
them out to all the ladies on the plane
yes do it do it i dare you and take a
picture I put it on Instagram all right
Cheryl said folks put the order on the
bottom of your feet when flying no one
wants to smell feet on the plane that's
a really good point um I see you fbh I
didn't see what you said before but I
see you now Kristy Lee says I always
miss the live feed happy to caught this
time happy that you're here Delaney says
I hate those feelings when you put your
finger in the sponge makes you wanna gag
i like i like the little sponge nail
polish remover things i like them a lot
but not for travel not for travel julie
says elf has the one dollar remover pads
they dry out quickly but for the trip it
will work great and Rosie says hi Jen
just waking up when I made it so glad
you're here Rosie I Rosie busy cop says
I'm too hung over and there's mud in my
hair off oh no why ask you about your
night girlfriend oh my gosh Valerie says
bring your makeup eraser on your trip I
love traveling that thing i love my
makeup eraser and that's a really good
idea make up a racer is super fab excuse
me the makeup eraser maybe an overpriced
towel but i love mine it's really good
it's really good and all you need is
water to look hot like warm water so if
you've access to warm water on your trip
which most trips you do i probably won't
have access to warm well no i probably
will even when we're camping i'm sure
we'll camp in places that have water
access I don't like we're going to rough
it that much um so
so yeah definitely I love my makeup
eraser I repurchased it why didn't
purchase the first one the first one was
sent to me and then I purchased one oh
my gosh went mudding um washcloths is
similar and cheaper am I the other thing
is with the with the wash boss for this
makeup racism a couple racer is so much
softer and I feel like it's more
efficient than a traditional washcloth
that's just me personally like it's and
I feel like which will with a washcloth
I do need to use a cleanser where with
the makeup racer I don't feel like I do
so that's just me I don't know I just
like it's more efficient for me but
that's just my personal experience um
let's see oh this is this I did this for
a video once don't do this if you're not
doing a video this says mask your roots
with the mascara got roots you just
noticed if you have dark hair use your
mascara to cover up expose regrowth stat
okay you know what happens when you put
mascara on your roots it turns into a
crunchy mess and it's creepy-looking in
real life I can't tell in a video that I
did that with my hair but don't do that
this is a terrible piece of advice I
don't know who wrote this article for
cosmopolitan but there's a lot of really
weird things in this article like the
whole deodorant on the face thing and
then now putting mascara and your hair
don't do that and it's really gross to
get out too because then your hair turns
all black like and when you wash it out
in the shower it's like all black
everywhere it's a rule um use butter as
lip balm butters I don't know who wrote
this article ask the flight attendant
for a pack of butter and a pinch it
makes for amazing and yummy substitute
for lip balm okay I'm gonna believe you
on that one I'm shocked at what I just
sounds so gross oh my goodness oh no no
right they do make products they do make
make a products that you can use like as
the fur like your roots or whatever yeah
not a good idea not a good idea all
right we've got 15 minutes left let's go
into a different article this one is by
Web MD I know butter on your lip like I
just imagined it like going down my chin
and like at all these dead so much
and like that's just not a good idea all
right let's see what WebMD has to say
okay they're just talked about
moisturizing um the other saying don't
use foundation the day of the trip
instead we're just moisturizer before
you land at a tinted moisturizer for a
fresh healthy look but some people want
more than that so I don't know Oh French
hornist says coconut oil is good live
long yes definitely definitely um what
is the make up a razor kenzie wants to
know it is a long cloth um that you
thank you for real cancer as webmd we're
all gonna die I know right I know I'm
with you Mallory ok so the makeup eraser
is like a long they selling it to
forex like 20 bucks or something and
it's really just a cloth and i use both
sides it says one sides for exfoliating
on one sides for removing your makeup
but it really takes makeup off very
efficiently you just put it in hot water
and what I do is I mostly focus on my
eye makeup with the makeup eraser so
that i can use it multiple times and I
try to use a small of a section as
possible and then I just work my way
down one side and then I flip it over
and I use the other side which probably
isn't the most hygienic thing in the
world but that's what I do so late of
using a big eraser like six times before
I have to wash it Gina says Jen okay
waited to the end tell me your true
thoughts about the makeup remover cloth
thing the pink you're supposed to not
need a cleanser but on a trip it's not
liquid yes and honestly Gina I do love
my makeup eraser I have to tell you to
be honest I love it I do is it but
people say you can just get a microfiber
towel and it does exactly the same thing
I have not tried that I don't feel like
I pixie I feel like it's different than
a washcloth that's just me personally I
feel like which a with a washcloth I
need to use some kind of soap with a
mega racer I don't feel like I do you
wash it in the washing machine with the
rest of your clothes that's how you
watch a Jacqueline it's pretty I love
mine I may be gimmicky I don't know but
I love mine and I think it works great
and it makes me happy so I don't know
Valerie says oh wow see that thing
doesn't do well at all with my eye
makeup i use a separate eye makeup
remover on see it works really well for
my eye makeup I don't know but you know
I don't know that's just me and then um
Shay says she doesn't like make a
racer and Kenisha says washcloth sounds
like my grandma's pronunciation
washcloth I didn't mean to say washcloth
I'm usually say washcloth I was a that
was a mooloolaba it's very very soft to
make a racer super super super soft but
oh the other thing is with I makeup
remover um if you want about good nice
good travel I make a remover take some
coconut will impress it into like an old
lip balm tin or more like a little jar
or whatever and press it in and use
coconut oil as an as an eye makeup
remover works really really really well
I've been using the bombs time bomb I
makeup remover and i like it just a
little bit better than coconut oil but I
feel like the fact that it's in a tin
really makes it super easy to use the
bombs time bomb makeup remover but the
coconut oil works just as well well
close to just as well and it's a sinking
heck of a lot cheaper but yeah like a
little tin or a little jar of coconut
arm of coconut oil to take with you for
eye makeup removing bad kid okay kitty
we're all going to die it at some point
anyway so live like what you want to
there you go can you just says Jensen
was talking about product called a
washcloth oh okay alright nevermind then
Melanie says coconut oil is great for so
many things it really is um the sander
says doesn't it pulls your skin not good
for wrinkles anytime you're trying to
remove something from your face you're
going to have to any time you're trying
to you have to use any kind of you know
you're going to have to put some kind of
pressure on your face I mean even when I
use coconut oil in my eyes I still have
to rub like I don't even make up one so
I can do this I still have to go like
this and rub my eyes to get you know it
off so I don't feel like it's any oh
it's a brick Julie's trying to explain
it to me too and so Sarah okay hi Kathy
um washes the name of the late it makes
the clock I understand okay thank you
all right so anyway I think any time
you're trying to remove something from
your face you're gonna have to pull on
at least a little bit and I feel like
with the makeup eraser it's just like
any other when you're you have to like
if you're using on makeup remover wipe
you're going to have to pull a little
bit so I feel like it's pretty much the
same you should have to be gentle you
know but it does work that's my opinion
seems like I'm in the minority here
though so you may not want
to me because I like it but it seems
like like seventy-five percent of the
people here don't like to make a bracer
I like mine so you listen to me or you
can listen to seventy-five percent of
people that are here don't get it that's
up to you if I were you I'd probably go
with the seventy-five percent because
they outnumber me but you know all right
so anyway let's go back to this Web MD
article we got nine minutes left they
say miss with mineral waters we talked
about that they're saying blot out oily
skins keep oily skin out of I from
getting our control while traveling
bring blotting papers or rice papers and
dab the t-zone add some shimmer just
traveling them your face bit green and
the gills perk up a tired sallow
complexion with a soft shimmer powder or
cream skip long-lasting lip sticks they
say to give lips color that will last
through your trip skip the long lasting
lipsticks the only dehydrate and parks
your mouth that's pretty smart instead
of crimson instead crimson I guess
that's the person says color your lips
with several coats of a lip stain let
dry on top of the clear gloss reapply
the gloss throughout the trip and your
lips will look just made up fresh that's
the tip I link that one apply lip
treatment illiberal a so hydrating your
lips really really important and then
chill out puffy eyes to reduce under-eye
puffiness after long trip american hotel
hotel lodging association vice president
chief operating officer says to put
crushed ice in a washcloth and apply it
under the eyes it's an automatic wake-up
call that makes you look and feel
immediately fresher I don't know I guess
you can't ask for ice on the plane and
say can I have ice and a washcloth perk
up your peepers watching back-to-back
inflight movies or reading that
paperback novel cover to cover can cause
weary weight can cause you to arrive at
your destination with red watery not so
attractive eyes to avoid it Los Angeles
above a person says don't forget to
bring eye drops the lubricating soothe
your eyes if you're reading or watching
movie and blah blah so I drops is the
point of that one uh French hornist says
on topic is suggested moisturizing on a
flight Michelle Phan had a video saying
products to bring all traveling so apply
makeup half an hour before landing so it
looks fresh okay cool man I don't think
I'm gonna go that far but if that's your
thing yeah definitely nicole says I do
unique lip stain when I
she loves it as a tented bomb for high
then she applies attempted bomb for
hydration nice and cam says I've heard
the perm papers can be used for blotting
paper or less expensive interesting I've
never heard that before um yeah Julie
says prone papers is genius Diana says
I've tried uh that it cosmetics bomb
cleanser works awesome I can use it on
waterproof a regular makeup love it and

cream eyeshadows which have a tendency
to move around your face as you snooze
been bringing a posh we talk your face
that makes sense take your cleanser with

cleanser that you're used to using

trend we did it was a fun one it was a
fun one um but yeah we have done that I
think I'm gonna do the brush one coming
up soon and we did a brush makeup chat a
while ago but I want to do another one
I'm not sure if it'll be before after
the trips I don't know if we're gonna be
doing chat during our trip or not
because it will really depend on
internet connection I don't know what's
going to happen I'm trying not to commit
to anything because I don't know what's
going to happen we go on our trip we're
leaving for a trip the I want to say
it's like June twenty fifth something
like that and then we'll be back the is
like july twenty seconds something like

minutes of the chat don't worry give it
