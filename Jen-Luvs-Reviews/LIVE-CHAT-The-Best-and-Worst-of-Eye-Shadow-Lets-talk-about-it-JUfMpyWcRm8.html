friends welcome to our discussion of all
things I shadow I am so excited about
this chat I just barely made it on the
wire like I was like running up the
steps and even get a chance to make a
cup of coffee because i had to get here
at five o'clock so i'm really glad to be
here at this later time on saturday and
i am hoping that they're going to be a
lot of people they're able to join us
even though i just made this go live i'm
hoping that people are here i'm loading
the window right now let's see if
anybody is actually here probably not so
let's just go ahead and start talking
about eyeshadow even though i don't
think that anybody in chat yet because i
like literally just made this like with
the lank I don't even know if people are
gonna be notified yet oh gosh okay ah ok
well hopefully people will start showing
up at some point I don't know I'm a
little nervous o Beauty hopeful 11 made
it Roxanne made it ok I'm feeling better
now not if there's more people here oh
my goodness I was getting a little
nervous ok good so what I've done is
I've put a bunch of my palettes behind
me and these are just extra palace this
is the em cosmetics one I never I never
use this I know I don't know why it's
actually a pretty nice palette I don't
know but I definitely want to talk about
I know yeah yeah ok good tabatha made it
Leslie made it all right let's talk
about some eyeshadow so first thing I
want to talk to you all about our let me
know what should we talk about there's
lots of good things to talk about maybe
we should just dip into uh I don't know
I don't know I had no plan I was hoping
there was a party gonna be conversation
going hey Meggie ok let's go ahead and
let's start with talking about the
different price palettes maybe this is
the new vice for palette and so far I'm
really really enjoying it a lot I
haven't even taken the classic on the
mirror yet that's how new this thing is
I've heard some negative reviews on this
so far but I'm really starting to like
it hey Nicky hey Steph all right oh you
want to see the m1
and I will show you that let's pull that
back out this was the light palette and
I got this during the holiday season
right after it came out and I wasn't
sure whether I was going to get it
because it's like seventy dollars or
something crazy and then um oh okay
having that you just have the reveal
Palace Roxanne says she just has a
reveal pouch she's looking for some
other palettes we will definitely get
into the real cops I have all three um
so this was the em cosmetics palette and
this um yeah I'm not I think that they
were really nice shadows but the bulky
packaging and the little tongue pans I
don't know it just kind of got me on the
blushes are pretty nice but I like the
lid prop the the power gets into the lip
products these are lip products over
here and it was just a really weird
setup of a palette so I just I don't
know and then there was a way that you
could take these pan out they gave you a
little tool to pull the pans out which
was super cute and then they gave a
little side one like a little small one
that you could pull them out and put
them into like a smaller palette if you
wanted to which was cool but I don't
know i mean the quality was good but it
wasn't anything so good that it was it
was unforgettable you know what I mean
it's just a very forgettable palette
when it comes out let's say good evening
Emily never take the plastic off it
usually falls off after a while off the
mirror Maggie says funny thing is i have
so many high-end palettes i'm obsessed
right now with the simple ten-dollar elf
palette yes those tenten those alf
pallets are amazing hey it's christine
lee 314 she has a great channel click on
her name she's amazing Elizabeth Jen
I've been looking for drugstore
transition shade is preferably just in a
single pan not a palette I've heard
about the mini the Milani bella eyes
anyone have any good suggestions okay so
this is where i'm going to start
drowning in comments so I'm going to try
really hard to keep up maybe what I'll
do is I'll just kind of pull this up so
they don't miss things but if people
start complaining that I'm not answering
them please let them know that I'm kind
of going in order so don't tell them
don't get mad at me then I'm going as
fast as I can because we got a couple
things going on the elf palette let's go
into those real quick and I put my
microphone down these elf pallets are
amazing they're really really good I
mean for
for ten dollars i mean they're
definitely really really good the best
one of all is of course the one that i
don't have in my hand and it's the the
nude one the need at nude one is
absolutely fabulous I do have a full
review I'm trying to see my calf imma
need a new one I do it's right here this
one is absolutely amazing I would
compare this to my higher end shadows
these these really are wonderful
wonderful quality they're very easy to
use very easy to blend definitely worth
the price now these here are the same
this is the everyday smoky which is
there my dog is barking I'm hoping my
kids will take care of it yes okay um
will you let the dog in please sorry
will you let the dog in he's barking
thank you this is the everyday smoky
palette I really like this one a lot as
well but the lasting power on the other
ones these are not as good this is my
least favorite this is the party ready
and it's definitely not as pigmented as
it looks so don't expect the city of
super bright palette at all but it's
really really good quality of course my
son's down there yelling I apologize mad
from that this one's also very good with
the let the lasting power isn't good so
if you're okay what baby I'm in chat yes
you can yes you can oh my goodness all
right so anyway lasting powers are very
good but if you can we get through this
chad i don't even know with the dog
barking and everything um if you can get
through the lasting power issues the
blend ability and the usability deal is
amazing home us got let me see if i can
close the door then hopefully that will
help with the loudness all right
hopefully crossing my fingers there
won't be so bad okay so that's one thing
yes thumbs up on the elf pellets i have
a full review on my channel if you click
around you will be able to find self
review now as far as a matte transition
shade in an eyeshadow single honestly i
don't have any
I would love to hear some suggestions I
don't know why my god never barks I no
idea why he's barking um I might have to
go down there which would be horribly
sad to have to stop in the middle of
chats go down and get my dog and figure
out why no Romans bar bang um I think
I'm gonna have to this really stinks I
am so sorry like this is like a video
that was playing on using for like
reference for later and my dog is
flipping out if anybody comes in just
tell them I went to go get my dog and
I'm right back it's like there's nothing
I can do about it hold on a second I
guess figure out what's going on with
him why are you barking what is your
problem what is your problem what are
you okay I'm coming oh my gosh I'm so
sorry okay there was a guy gardening and
my next door neighbor's yard and like
he's barking the guidance gardening so I
closed the blinds I turned them up so
hopefully then that'll be done I'm so
sorry things happen you know it's
running live okay so single eyeshadows
and now I'm failing to because I don't
have any like really good single matte
shadows that Bella I shadows you really
are amazing if you can find that one
that's the problems all the Bell I shows
i have after all shimmery did not mat
and for a nice transition shade you're
in a nice matte shade so all right okay
moving on oh my gosh and he's still
barking there's nothing I can do about
it was barking it's something that's a
guy I can't even stop it but I'm not
going to kill chat I'm not going
it's not worth it I'm so sorry okay I'm
gonna stop apologizing i'm just going to
talk over it all right daughter and snow
says i love pallets but I end up putting
them under my sink and totally
forgetting about them well where do you
store these so you remember to use them
I have them in this store right here is
where I keep my palettes and then I keep
my singles in the different or but in my
old house before I had this I had that
widened why is he coming upstairs
there's no there's nothing to work out
up here why is he coming up here bored I
don't even know what to do at this point
okay I'm gonna keep going that's what
I'm going to do ok so that's how I come
over to use them as I have the mark here
but I old house before I had um before I
had the drawer system I had been tipsy
bags and I just had different epsy bags
for different purposes that's the way I
store them I don't know that's that's
what I did um yeah that's what they did
well I had a boy I had my products
against FC bags but like Alan to my baby
so I never forgot to use my palates I
don't think hi Tina Laura oh my name is
watching the first time high from
Ireland hi to Ireland omen is so good to
see you in Ireland well you know I can't
see you in argument but glad that you're
here from Ireland steps talking about
how some of the eyeshadow palettes are
amazing that's awesome amanda says she
likes my hair thank you very much and
stuff says the Bella I shadows are nice
I agree when wild calots are amazing if
you're looking for transition colors
definitely check out the wet'n'wild
pallets this one was limited edition so
I know you can't get this one anymore
but I definitely use some of these for
transition let's see this one here is a
really nice warm transition color that I
use a lot but again this one's love in
addition so i can t want to talk to you
about that um but yeah then check out
the mall collins because they are very
very high quality all right um let's see
all right Maggie says I'm a nap problem
i faced the extra cause i have the extra
content hooray but though I login
through Facebook
i tries getting a pig and i would rather
watch on the ipad do i need to cancel
sub andres up you shouldn't have to
someone figured out the trek of how to
do it on the ipad and i don't know how
they did what i can do is contact the
app creators do me a favor send me an
email so that i don't forget to contact
them and ask them what you should do so
Maggie just send me an email at Jen
loans reviews that you know that comment
we will take care of it absolutely
christine lee 314 on the shoutout you
are amazing alright making kool i'm so
happy that the chat with change today
sundays i'm too busy good i'm so glad
that you're here all right let's say
hello there world it's me hello are the
naked palettes really worth the money
they aren't cheap but are if they're
worth it ok i can tell you that this is
the only naked palette that i own this
is the naked you when i first started my
channel this is what helped me feel
confident and do my shadow with powers
and i would say that honestly truly like
these are very easy to work with you can
get a ton of looks from them I can't
speak from personal experience about the
other ones that I've heard the other
ones are similar especially the original
Naked palette some people really love
the naked 3 i've heard mixed reviews
about the naked smoky but some people
seem to really love that I think I
definitely my answers yes it is worth it
it's absolutely worth it and I hate to
say that it's worth it because they're
expensive what I would definitely say
yes they are worth it um I mean I
honestly like I'm trying to think like
even the elf palettes like what you
might want to do if you're really
worried about it you really don't want
to spend that much look at the needed
nude from elf and see what you think of
those shades but then you're not going
to get the same shade range as you do
and in a naked palette so it's like in
that way like I'd like they perform
similarly but at the same time you're
not going to get as many looks out of it
and it's not as easy to work with if you
don't have as many choices if that makes
sense so i would i would personally say
invest the Naked palette rather than
buying 10 drugstore I shadows or you
know i mean it sometimes it's better
just just to go ahead and pay for
something bigger that you love and they
can use
every single day so that's my opinion on
that pana says I'm new to chat this is
cool happy to be here happy to have you
here Hannah Nikki I have one of the LT
off Matt one it's good for the price I
don't like their big palette so I've
never tried them the prison telenet
natural a neutral i forget looks like
foiled shadows I'd never tried them
Nikki but that's really good to know all
right Jane esta hello hello I don't know
if people want me to say your real names
on here or not that I know Jane SS real
name but I don't know if she wants me to
say it so long Lauren falini first type
thing first time I Chad so glad to have
you magneti says she likes the elf prism
she's amazed with them Tina Marie I said
this is the first time I chose well so
good to see you Tina's is taking a break
from singing tonight she's supposed to
be singing she's singing tomorrow but
she got a chance to mount singing
tonight so we got very lucky you got
zapped Tina with us tonight Kyra hi
everyone first time they want to make it
so happy to have you here Kyra let's say
yes def agree elf is very hit-or-miss I
totally agree and only anyone gets
planning to get the Urban Decay spectrum
how it looks beautiful in the price is
fair enough but I've never gotten Urban
Decay eyeshadow it was a good idea I've
heard wonderful things about the
spectrum palette I did get the vice for
and I do really like it but I've heard
that the spectrums better than this one
so I want to use this once but so far
I'm really really loving it a lot Maggie
says have you heard that the prisms are
better than the ones genda showed I I
don't know anything about the prison's
I've never tried them Kiki is here
kicking Fernandez hi my Kiki Kiki's
awesome she's always posting on the app
all the time Laura Foley says she can't
buy elf in Ireland oh sorry o princess
violet so happy that you are here Mickey
Young says makeup geek has good
transition shades that's a really good
point totally agree with that and also
check out on coastal scents Coastal
Scents has really good the hot pots
sometimes they have sales with are only
a dollar each I think there are two
dollars each regular price but Coastal
Scents has some amazing eye shadows
that's a really good point good job on
the makeup geek very smart dance party
Oh dance party I wish I had to use it we
could totally against cry but then I get
truck yet
copyright for the music so I'm so sorry
to you that your dog is going crazy
because of my goofy dog alright it just
scooped up so hopefully I can all right
Maggie says I saw or you that one of the
new Urban Decay's awesome on one is less
awesome I can't remember which one
people are saying that the spectrum is
better than device for that that's kind
of the general consensus am and I'm the
way to try and make a pecan color pop
and I still haven't definitely
definitely try it I honestly like I'm
dying over those makeup Keith foiled i
shouldn'ta the foiled the um the ones
who just came out with the duochrome
ones those look amazing I want some so
bad okay thank you I'm reading up um
Tabitha's comment about she's coming
back look amazing and so funny all right
Nikki so many people have makeup geek
and I'm bad now enough I have color pop
and now I want to try a new indie
company make a keek is actually really
good Hezbollah shadows so nikki says I
will let their holder I need to look at
them yes the letter holder chopped up to
for um for eyeshadow palettes like the
one that I have over here this one's
awesome i got it at marshalls in their
letter you know their office supply
section and i just got really lucky I
found that thing it was like 10 or 15
bucks and I've used it for years so it's
pretty awesome all right Roxanne says
how about anything from the bomb
especially since they're on hautelook
well let's see well I ordered I'm
dropping things I ordered the nude dude
so I can't speak to that one the new to
everybody I see review this thing always
says that they never reach for it what
it's very rare that anybody that I see
anybody say that yes this is an amazing
palette they use it all the time it's
got great shadows great quality but I
don't reach for it one thing i don't
like about is these two shades are about
the same shade and like these are super
dark but there's there's nothing there's
no brow bone color there's no like this
this is kind of a dark for a transition
like it's just a weird setup of colors
and that's why I'm fine about the ball
my shows is there amazing quality but
they're weird setup
shadows need Matt nude I have a whole
video and all the bomb products that I
owned at the time this is a very
fantastic eyeshadow palette for matte
shadows this is an amazing transition
color this Matt Abdul but again have I
don't reach for it and I reach for it
because as a complete palette it's just
weird to use they needed a champagne
color in here there's no champagne color
all you have is this white so it just
makes it weird it's just it's always
missing things and then that any up in
the balm palettes here's another one the
Rockstar palette bon jovi ok this one's
a little bit better as far as the
choices as far as having a nice
transition shade this is a library as a
nice transition shade got a nice brow
bone shades but again it's just a weird
selection of colors that don't really go
together I mean they're just like the
purple and the green I mean I guess if
you want to do like a nice high contrast
lump but just a strange selection of
colors and I think that's all of the
bombs eyeshadow palettes that I
personally own let me look and see make
sure it miss any I think that's all the
ones that I own i mighta more and some
people here might know which other ones
that I don't that I don't know where
they are but yes those those would be
the ones that I own I mean they're very
high quality shadows are just weird
weirdly selected colors um yes you turn
dogs barking to my dog was like nuts up
so glad it stops I don't know what
happened why he stopped but I'm so
thankful um nikki says colored pop is
great too but I like the shimmery ones
more because then that ones are hard to
blend so I would really use them as a
transition shade and I have kind of the
opposite they going on where I like the
shimmery ones I don't like the sparkly
ones the matte ones haven't been a
problem for me i usually use my fingers
and tap them on where I want them and
then blend them in but honestly i don't
know if i'm going to buy too many more
color pop I shadows even though there
they are good quality I just I don't
find them fun to work with if that makes
sense they're just there the creamy
texture it's just their pain in the butt
for me like they don't work well with a
brush for me and I just I just don't
enjoy using them so I probably won't buy
I too many more color cop I shows it's
just not my taste I know a lot of people
love them but
I personally prefer their lip products
that's just me and their highlighters
are amazing and their blushes are
amazing and I don't know for the
bronzers but blushes lip products and
highlighters those are the ones I like
from colour-pop that's just me though
it's not that they're bad it's just a
personal preference thing Maggie says
barking he's worse for you than this for
us some kind of problem I know it was
terrible and I couldn't even oh my gosh
I couldn't even I'm so glad that that's
done yes Kyra and totally wiki she said
she loves the colour-pop lippie but I
can't stand the glitter fall all over my
face from their shadows I am totally
with you I am sorry your dogs were
barking tabatha I apologize I think he
says she doesn't get much fallout from
the colour-pop but she doesn't know why
it might just be the primer that you're
using my be here she'd know what primary
using Laura says I can't get color pop
here into nightmare off I'm so sorry
comfort zone wet'n'wild is a fabulous
eye shadow palette it really is it's
amazing five bucks five bucks Cherie oh
I like your hair just joining hi from
Oklahoma hide Oklahoma thank you so much
I'm so glad you like my hair it was
definitely a risk I took a risk on it I
jumped in I was like I want my hair
looking like it was dipped in paint
that's what I want and that's what I got
let's see Calista says hi from Oklahoma
so happy to see you Jessica hello um
some things you're like in context of
having trouble following along some of
the comments Nikki said stay away from
the naked smoky ACK that's good to know
crystal says I'm late to the party so
you may have covered this but single
pant eyeshadows that don't break the
bank so I'm great quality my favorite
single pan on shadows you know I've
heard really good things about the elf
single pans but I don't own any of those
the Milani Bella eyeshadows are amazing
and the pacifica ones believe it or not
these specific eyeshadows are actually
very very good i got these in
subscription boxes this one is in the
shade treasure but look at this look how
creamy that is can you see that nice
watch I just watch us from video I shot
this morning shot my uh what's on my
face for this look that city is
exclusively on the ones at the makeup
website went to the makeup calm well
yeah I mean look how beautiful that is
and these are a very very low
they're like the vegan cruelty-free no
parabens no petrolatum stuff like that
so these are really really good also if
you're willing I mean this is a little
bit pricier for a single shadow are the
where they go Wow oh here we go the
Loreal infallible Tsar amazing if you
are willing to spend I think they're
like six bucks apiece six seven dollars
apiece something like that i can 699 but
they are compared to the Giorgio Armani
I think they're the same company Lori
Allen giorgio armani the looks to kill
Ric kill Isaac hill but they're
fantastic quality they really are this
one's an iced latte it's very famous for
being fabulous it's a wonderful
wonderful shade we say there any other
ones that are I have that are amazing oh
this one here this is the Loreal
infallible in where's j am a rush this
is another really good one swatch this
one for you this one is fat it's so
creamy and buttery like oh my gosh oh my
gosh amazing amazing amazing it's like
that like conf little rosy kind of tone
to it so pretty so pretty all right
let's go to the next time those
definitely on but again I've heard good
things about the elf ones as well let's
see Kyra said she hated the naked 3 it
turned into purple money mess on her
face you I've heard definitely heard
those kinds of things Elizabeth says
anyone having a good fall drugstore
lipsticks lip sticks is going to be
another week but I don't want it to
neglect you I've been really into liquid
lipsticks lately so I haven't really
been using as many regular lipsticks but
honestly I love the color public lip
products they're amazing they're so
moisturizing the lippie Stix and I
personally really like the liquid
lipsticks they are a bit drying so you
might want to wear them with a bomb put
a bomb under it and I'll keep more Matt
if you put a bomb over it then it'll be
a little less not but the colour-pop
ones really are fabulous so I'm going to
move on from that products this is all
about our shadow but yes those would be
my recommendations as far as in the
store I really like
rimmel's lipsticks I like that formula a
lot also Maloney's is nice if you can
get past a really strong fruity smell
wet and wild has some really good
lipsticks that are super super cheap but
to be careful of the deeper ones the
brighter ones because they do tend to
bleed so you want to make sure use a lip
liner with those but you know they're a
dollar so those are just some quick lip
recommendations let's see ilysies hi my
early oh my goodness I know you my rly
hello good to see you hi Tina Tina says
I have a negative one and three involve
both of them I would agree that they're
worth the price of three you really have
to like the color range which I do
everyone can use yeah i agree i think
that it's one of those that it has to
call to you yes amanda whole look is on
the place a bomb is on hautelook today
everything's fifty percent off i do have
a video about every product i owned by

you placed on here I that may help as
well hello there world it's me jen you
just made me scream in a good way hello
back sounds like they'll be investing in
naked college i was i was hoping to hold
out thank you for being honest
absolutely come on 2 for sale i know
right i'm week 42 girlfriend you would
be vote you'll be both okay it's
skipping down a little bit okay crystal
oh yeah I love l'oreal infallible zand
the elf ones what about a little single
pan refills though where you can create
your own palette Coastal Scents man
Coastal Scents let me show you my
Coastal Scents palette honestly like and
i will tell you because i'm always
honest this I got with dollars that they
gave me to spend in their short from
doing a review of the reveal palette so
I do not purchase this I did not pay for
it it was given that was given money to
spend on the website and this is what I
made but i'm not i'm being honest with
you hashtag not sponsored staff me you
know a hashtag not sponsored here this
palette I made this I designed this this
is my phone palette and they love this
thing these single pans are amazing a
two bucks apiece I there isn't a pallet
of Han in here that I don't like now are
they the most amazing shadows ever no I
like my Kat Von D the like the kat von z
vida loca brights last longer on the eye
than these but they're really easy to
work with very easy to blend and they're
cheap they're really cheap and then the
palette should i think the pallets like
maybe ten or fifteen dollars into ten
dollars from the palette and these also
fit math pants so if you had some mac
pans that you wanted to put together you
can get a Coastal Scents palette if you
don't care that it says Coastal Scents
on it and use this as well but really
truly I love this I did it getting ready
with me on periscope using this palette
last week and it's amazing it's an
amazing i definitely recommend those a
lot like yes yes yes yes um Tabitha's is
anyone using makeup revolution palettes
I hear they're good dudes for the naked
I've heard that too i have not tried
them yet I've thought about it but I
haven't sherry says I apologize can't
just walked across the keyboard haha I
was wondering what all those weird
random things were oven so funny alright
Bad Kitty beauty I've been wondering
about buying colour-pop yeah I mean it
like it's a weird formula it's very wet
and like creamy and wet so it's not the
easiest formula to work with but they
really are beautiful shades the gorgeous
shades but it's really difficult to work
with it x daughter and snow is talking
to sherry ok k j JK JK Kirsch I can't
wait till Christmas I want the naked 3
and a tart blush palette now I just have
to convince my husband's yes I saw her
view on the chart blush palette today it
looks pretty nice I don't think I'm
gonna get it I got last year's and I
hardly ever use it something we got the
one this year and the naked 3 I don't I
think I want to pass on the naked 3 as
well but I've heard wonderful things
about I really think like someone saying
earlier it just has to call to you
alyssa says I got a coffee ready I'm so
happy to join you say and you know I'm
so mad I don't have any coffee right now
like I it was it was 459 and I was like
I don't wanna be coffee like really like
I don't have any coffee like I can't
believe it I can't believe I don't have
coffee like what this is my first chat
but I don't have coffee so i'm jealous
right now from jealous right now you
have coffee and I don't Tina says I'm
getting ready to buy that mug duochrome
shadows I know I really want them but I
haven't gotten them I should get them
but then they were sold out us of the
ones i really wanted to that make me
want to wait until they were back in
stock so that i could get all the ones i
wanted it one shot so I don't know all
right thoughts of the maybe it'll local
palate all right this is what i use
today maybe put those reveal palettes
down this palette is so fabulous it
really genuinely truly is like I want to
take out um I want to do a full review
on this because it
is amazing and let me tell you why it's
amazing it's amazing because I feel like
I can use some of these Brides at work
I'm not even kidding like right now this
I look I wouldn't wear work because it's
too smoky on the outsides but if I toned
it down a little bit like if I didn't
use this dark color but I use these
light colors instead and then use some
of these neutrals to balance it out
iphone web rights to work I probe rights
to work the other day I wore these
purple stores it was purple I had all my
eyes at work and the reason why it's
possible is because the shadows are so
stinkin blendable like they do pack on
that color and they blend out so
beautifully without blending away and
it's really truly my dream formula is
this college and she had released not
last year so I didn't like that pot last
year but the year before she had
released holiday felt that I felt just
in love with as I am in love with this
one and it's just I've never had shadows
that are this easy to work with it just
amazes me every time I use it this is
I'd use it this is the second or third
time i've used it trying to remember i
think this is the third i hate to say i
don't want to say it's either the second
or third time I've use that I use it
today on my eyes I use and this is in
the what's on my face video that's going
to be exclusively on the website
tomorrow this one here this right here
is the one I have in the outer corner I
have this popped in the middle and then
i have this to blend out the inner
corner and then i have this for the brow
bone and then I popped a little tiny bit
of the black in the outer corner just to
deepen it up a little bit and it was
just so easy it was so easy and that's
the way I feel about the naked tells is
this just they make it so easy and when
you fight with eyeshadow with so many
different palettes like for example
Veronica who on he's wonderful and sweet
and fantastic this palette did not work
for her she's one of my friends from the
wats Ben make up at the city more fern
she was so kind of sentencing and this
palette has some beautiful shades in it
don't get me wrong and beautiful shades
but I can't work with this palette I
can't work with it it is a pain in the
butt to work with the shadows money
together or
can't get them to look the way I wanted
to look it is a pain to work with I will
still use this palette as individual
shadows if I need one of these colors
but I rarely rarely rarely will reach
for this for an entire look because I
don't like the wiggies work with each
other and it makes me super sad because
this is super high commute you bet I
know a lot of people love it and I don't
love this palette and it made it really
makes me sad and I can see why it didn't
work for wrong I could totally see why
um I'm still going to keep it and I'm
still going to use it and give it love
but it's not as lovely as I thought it
was going to be so I thank Veronica
forgive me that experience and I'm
really really glad to have it though but
it's not all that it was supposed to be
it's not it doesn't it doesn't do what
it needs to do in order to make a
functional look for me so that's just my
opinion all right I've been talking too
long without answering any comments but
that's my thoughts on the media loka
pellet um and I really love it I love it
um beauty haul 411 best instagram
channel ever Channel Nine Inch

everybody keeps telling me this sherry
says she loves the new to it was the
first one the palette she needs to
revisit it okay and and it's one of
those things where you're revisiting it
because you let it go because it's not
very functional it works really well but
it's not a functional as a pallet it's
hard to work with but I'm with you on
revisiting it I like to revisit it every
once awhile too but it's never gonna end

like the tartlet palette I just reached

kitty blonde hey how you doing so glad

know you say don't send new things and
blah blah blah but i didn't I wanted to
do not love you Shannon ok she says they
also find that I have to be careful
because what a lot of people find me
good transition color sometimes too dark
for this pale girl hmm yes that's true
go for those jumpy colors that's what i
did i go for coppice nikki says i love
them for blade colors and fun colors i
use them too much probably the color cop
is what we're talking about here let's
see yeah shannon says she has to see a
pallet in person before deciding I
totally agree
um oh I'm so glad that kidding you
couldn't even hear my dog oh good that
makes me feel so much better Emily I
actually have been experimenting with
the colour-pop I chars using sponges it
works really well whew that's a good
idea that's a really good idea that
keeping such as a learner too wet well
don't know Wow all right okay good to
know good to know thank you for the

love learning from you all to nikki says
I usually use the Urban Decay meeting

shadows interesting Cherie so glad to
get kinky all right oh my minute
scroll down scroll down okay oh the melt

Nikki they look gorgeous there's no way
I'm getting them though they are way too
expensive banking went often subject
your hair looks great thank you so much
I'm really enjoying it a lot definitely
different i'm really loving it Andy can
you want Jen coastal scents for single I
pans he wants he potted eyeshadow
singles yes absolutely totally agree
totally freak happy Jen I was I was lead
so you may have already talked about
this what about when was walking on
eggshells another good inexpensive
option yes amazing totally agree Cathy
great suggestion well done well done
Cathy totally agree um Tina says lori
almec does make the giorgio armani brand
yes I really think because I'm Lily Lily
Spurgeon who is my mind reporter had
sent me some of the giorgio armani eyes
to kill shadows and I'm telling you it's
really feels like the same quality let
me see if i can find quickly the one
that's similar to this one to the amber
brush so if i can find it here it is
right here i found it
it is number nine this is the giorgio
armani eyes to kill and will squash that
next to the amber rush I mean it's
different in tone but you'll see it's
like in pigmentation like oh wow it
looks even like the amber brush might
even be more pigmented look right up
here is the giorgio armani I see kill
and then there's the L'Oreal so I mean
based on this this was impact as good
though as a l'oreal so I have to do with
that but honestly like from that swatch
I like the boreal better than the
giorgio armani but I haven't tried this
on my eyes in a while it's been a while
since I've tried it because you guys
know that when you swatch something it's
not as so the same as when you put it on
your eyes so I'll to play with that
again more but you can see the swatch
alright princess love princess violet
never bought the Naked palette since I
had to reveal wanted to but girlfriend
I'm telling you it is totally different
quality totally different quality and
you guys you know look I'm a fan of
coastal scents but these pallets are not
nearly as easy to work with as the Urban
Decay Naked tell us I'm just going to
say it straight out there not i think
that the original revealed is the
closest and you have the original
revealed drop of things this is the
closest to high-end shadows but the two
and the three especially especially the
three is not easy to work with compared
to on the urban decay naked palettes I
mean you can do it if you want some
skill you can do it it can happen but if
you don't want to work for it this is
not that's my opinion that's my opinion
and honestly I would get the hot pots /
getting these like pick some hot pots
make a pallet rather than getting these
I really you feel like they're a
different quality and and also i feel
like the shadows in here are well this
one's actually pretty good but like the
shadows and here are hitting this
there's about a third of these shadows
that are totally powdery and terrible in
my opinion I don't like them at all
though getting hard pan on them and it
just they don't make me happy but this
one though the original one is actually
pretty good this one I like and like I
said you can get them to work but it's
not as easy as the urban decay it's
really not and I wish I could say that
they were the same but I'm not going to
lie about it just because one's cheaper
you know in San or once you know I'd
rather be able to say the cheaper ones
better but I can't that's my opinion but
everyone has different opinions and
everyone has a right to them so Nikki
said the elf smudge pots are nice for
basis for super quick i looks I've heard
that i do not own any but I've heard
that starter and snow says oh my gosh I
can't wait to chat about lipstick I need
help haha yes we need to do will do
lipstick Jackie think we should do
lipstick chat next week I think we
should be totally should okay oh let's
see elf smudge pots again oh um my early
says colour-pop lippie xand maybelline
lipsticks are so moisturizing mm-hmm i
found that the maybelline wants are
drying to me for some reason I don't
know why they they're a little drying
out um good drugstore fall blushes see
that's another show as well
drugstore fall blushes and honestly I
can tell you I don't own a lot of drug
store blushes because I've shown in
honey and blushes and I get so many
brushes and subscription boxes that I
don't really get a lot of drug store
blushes I can tell you that my favorite
ones right now are the jcat Beauty ones
that Jake a beauty sent me you can get
these at some old tons these are amazing
quality i love these also wet and wild
blushes are amazing the ones from
Coastal Scents if you're ordering postal
says these are super super super
pigmented they're very difficult to work
with because the pigmentation is so
insane that we use a super fluffy brush
like really fluffy in order to get those
to work the city color if you can find
city color there blushes are also super
pigmented but they're a little easier to
work with in the coastal scents these
can be found at five below or on their
website let's see anything else that I
have this drugstore the knicks washes
are really nice I like Nick's blushes a
lot those are great that's one of the
few nicks products that can vouch for
one hundred percent own thing I've ever
gotten a NYX blush that I didn't like
where most of their products are hitting
this for me they are but the knicks
blushes are fab i really like those a
lot all right Terry hey all Terry from
Kansas just receive my
earth to face palette and I chose a
semi-sweet I blue eyes combo any
suggestions for the best look I don't
have a two-faced semi-sweet but if you
guys want to help out Terry at terry Lee
T erri le e and then you can do nifty
and thrifty is the rest of her name but
I'm sure there are a ton of looks on
youtube but I don't own that one so i
can't speak to it i'm sorry all right
hello there world it's me would you do
one of these chats ones one of those for
sales approaching and also for the
holiday collections will be nice good
ideas and suggestions from you and
everyone sure absolutely I think they
would be great to do that right before
the ansa for a sale I think that would
be a wonderful idea absolutely i'm
totally with you um Calissa k our Mac I
shows worth buying okay i am not a good
judge of this and i will tell you why
I'm not he's the only mac eyeshadows
that i own and most of them are terrible
okay so I know this cannot be a good
representation of what mac eyeshadows
are all about this is a Cinderella
palette that um it was called stroke of
midnight Cinderella think got me and I
don't enjoy this palette at all like at
all it has obviously to have the shades
in here that are in here it has vapor
floof omega quarry satin taupe and
stroke of midnight my favorite shades in
here are satin taupe and floof the other
ones i pick totally do without this is
satin taupe and then this is um flu
let's see if I can swatch I'm also watch
them on the inside here but these are
fun to work with especially satin taupe
satin taupe is amazing but I've also
heard that in these math pallets they're
not the same as they are sometimes in
the individual pans so I know I can't
even like I can't even I know there are
people that swear by those map shows
swear by them and I just don't have
enough experience with them so all right
indique anyone says jane your makeup
looks very soft and romantic thank you
so much that's so sweet of you sam says
off topic but the bombs blushes are
amazing yes they are bombed blushes are
amazing totally create every formula of
the bombs blushes are amazing i
personally am very partial right now to
the staining hack ones
did you last a really long kind of all
their blushes last a long time and the
bronzer is all their cheek products like
their highlighters fabulous sherry says
I'd or both chocolate bar palette just
jump in an experiment the teal color as
a base to show up so pretty on the lower
lash line and a company eyeliner under
it so just get any suggestions for that
semi sweet I want them but I'm not going
to tell me not going to get me if they
came out with a third version then i
would consider but the semi-sweet didn't
call to me for some reason the original
still calls to me every time I go in the
store so costly but and rough I'll ever
get it all right we got 15 minutes ish
left that makes down a couple extra
minutes we'll have to see let's see keep
going okay um Elizabeth says is the
Coastal Scents palette worth the money
in height I feel like if you're going to
a coastal scents get the hot pots don't
get the pallets in my opinion except for
the original repeal palette the hot pots
are awesome I actually have individual
reviews with swatches of all three
revealed palettes if you go to my
channel and search for the revealed
palettes you'll find reviews on all
three if you want to check out more and
my original opinions of them but yes get
the hot cause design your own palette
that's my advice on the Coastal Scents
tick Maggie says and everyone my new my
own session is in bare minerals five and
one cream shadow primer they're gorgeous
and perfect base color and their
sunscreen to have nine colors I have
never tried those that sounds amazing
though I want to try that that sounds
amazing all right nurse says hey Jen
love for this sample turkey that is cool
so love to Turkey absolutely Marissa
says I like both as well I don't know
what you're talking about okay off it
skipped down let me see if I can find my
way up okay okay let me scroll down okay
we're getting married getting there
sometimes I get behind and I have to
click and it screws all trolls all the
way down pyrus talking about her name
yes my mom did spell my name
phonetically but Kyra Kyra Sedgwick
ruined it for her she knows she doesn't
see that it's k IE ra would be better
for Kira sarah says what's your favorite
makeup brand
overall I would say my favorite makeup
brands I guess it just depends on what's
up baby on the chat is it sort of thing
rocks from China ok I will talk to her
in 10 minutes she's not supposed to go
past a certain point on her bike and
he's tattling on her all right I told
she like I told mommy that you did all
right their makeup grand right now
haiyan see it was to face until I bought
that terrible holiday palette the one
the the the grand police or whatever
pilot thing was horrible and now I'm
like to face you're not my friend
anymore so right now I'm feeling have
fun to you right now I totally feel like
that Mundy as far as drugstore brands
right now I guess Maybelline is probably
my favorite right now for drugstore
brands um you know they've been really
impressed me with a lot of their
products lately but yeah yeah Kat Von D
kat von d i'm waiting for her to cut
with more products so she discontinued a
lot of my favorite stuff for blushes i
love i love her liquid eyeliner the
tattoo liner in trooper is amazing so
those are being proud of my favorites
daughter and snow with the best primer
for the eyes best primer for the eyes I
have a few that I really like and so I
could find one that I'm thinking about
on the top of my head it might be buried
ok I can't find it I think it was one of
those ones that I took it on vacation
and I never unpacked it ok because I
haven't been able to find the Urban
Decay primer potion the anti-aging one
is amazing I also really love the mac
paint pot and pan early as a primer and
then Micah beauty has one it's very very
overpriced out in a subscription box
there primer is amazing but the most
easily accessible ones are the Mac Paint
Pot in painterly and the Urban Decay
anti-aging primer I thought the
anti-aging primer is better than the
original in my personal opinion I do
feel like it has some anti-aging
benefits I see less um my eyelid seemed
a little more
so when I use it regularly but I had to
use it regularly like straight two weeks
in order to see something but I feel
like my shadows are more vibrant and
they stay on longer with that one versus
the original so those are my favorites
i'm also a drugstore the elf one is my
favorite one from the drugstore the
Milani one is also really really really
good matte shadows in turn try to add
overrated that's what ever and that's
what I've heard um Marissa said your
favorite color and naked too Oh
girlfriend that's like pick up at weimar
children okay my favorite probably I can
even tell you it's ydk ydk is my
favorite IDK why are you kidding right
there oh my gosh I die over this color I
die over this color ydk definitely oh
yeah I bought it um okay okay yes the
orig original Urban Decay primer potion
is on sale at Urban Decay I believe I
they were on hautelook I think there
were only like six bucks apiece on
hautelook at one point sherry says she
loves it smashbox 24 hour photo finish
in the Urban Decay primer potion yep the
photo finish though like it's on silicon
based so it's kind of it's not right for
everybody and one says Mac shadows are
more expensive um worse for my opinion
interesting but Stefan's like I said not
sponsored that's like they was Stefan
we're on periscope is hashtag not
sponsored all right Kiki to face to face
primers great and honestly I feel like
the toothpaste shadow insurance primer
is equally as good as the Urban Decay
primer potion so it's really whichever
company like supporting I really thought
they performed exactly the same I've
done like a test for I've done one on
each eye and they both perform exactly
the same kyra stains Smashbox 24 hour I
behind mark maybe I'm thinking about the
face primer that's the silicone base I'm
gonna favor ever try the 24 hour I
primer now that I'm thinking about it I
think I misspoke the only very tried to
face primer sherry says drugstore Fergie
primers not she bad I you know I didn't
have good luck with that one but you
know everyone's eyelids
different I didn't have good luck with
that one bad candy beauty Urban Decay
primer potion um my early says seriously
if you were sponsored I could care less
because I know you take the sponsorship
lightly and and that's why I don't get a
lot of sponsorships because I tell them
I'm going to be honest that I'm not
going to do a commercial and then they
say never mind that's having to be three
times in the past couple of months where
a company was like honesty nevermind
they want to give me actual money like
hundreds of dollars to make a video
lectures long as you're cool with I'm
honest hi forget it i don't need the
money that bad you guys are more
important than money than money you guys
that's what it comes down to is is
compromising my relationship with you is
not worth any money that's what it comes
down to because you guys are way more
important all right Cathy says Avon
shadow six you're really nice oh they're
on par with an ally ones ooh that's good
to know Kathy thank you so much for that
all right Jen how does morphy individual
shadows compared to the Coastal Scents
once I don't know morphy shadows I don't
know any so i can't speak to the morphe
once i'm sorry i've heard really good
things about the morphe shadow so let's
see Oh sarai hello hi sweetie love you
have you tried the Rouge buddy rude
eyeshadows they can be pricey but
underrated in my pain I heard really
good things I bruges bunny rouge push me
you know Laura from this is a little in
turn me on to that brands but I don't
own anything by them because they are so
crazy I just haven't invested in any but
i have heard wonderful things and they
are cruelty-free me all those good
things and I no strikes Roy has a
channel sincerely Sarai si si it's
sincerely and an sa RA I see she does
all natural cruelty free organic kinds
of makeup reviews on her channel great
channel um but yes yes I think a lot of
those cruelty-free brands that are only
sold on their website don't get enough
love because if they're not sold at a
store you can't earn points and all
those things least that's why I don't
give them as much love as I could um
yeah I wait for sales maybe we'll have a
good sale they were just on hautelook
not that long ago but I still pass
hawai i should have gotten some he's
talking about the Urban Decay primer
potion is amazing and then my early says
makeup revolution are really good I need
to try those and you try those Tina
Marie says her favorite primer is an
arse one which I have not tried sounds
cool sherry says I want to try makeup
revolution for the naked dukes I can't
make myself by the Urban Decay ones I
already have them combine it all so now
I've heard that too that they have
middle toe but I haven't I haven't tried
it and I'm also not too far for me I
should go by there and check it out yes
and then daughter and so I'm so a wiki
with shadow falling on my cheeks drives
me bonkers I cannot stand it and the
Urban Decay one the Urban Decay place
that I was going to talk about everybody
k 1 um where'd it go where'd you go
where'd you go where'd by sport I know
you guys probably see you at lunch and
it's right behind you um nice glitter
shadow because you have fallout I did
have problem of fallout with these for
the day like my cheeks were covered in
glitter glitter shadows there I'm still
playing on keeping at this point I
haven't used it enough I might end up
taking it back but right now I'm pretty
happy with it kyra says I just watched
and just saw him at shadow combos do one
side look with the chocolate palette the
other side with makeup revolution and
love with the chocolate the I love
chocolate and they were almost identical
cool man I will definitely have to check
that out or is it says what's your
favorite color pop um color and which
two would you recommend okay so I got
the thing about the car drop shadows
that I own is I got them all in sets so
I don't know if they're even available
individually um but let's say I really
like this one and snake but i think this
one yes this one is snake bite is
amazing it's like a gold but i don't
know if you can get that individually or
not but this one's amazing i love that
one this is the only single one that I
bought and this one no maybe just no
that's not the 1i bought individually
when we said I can find I like their
metallic you looking ones those are
really good this one in cornelius is
nice and I don't have them in the sets
anymore so I'm not sure which said I got
these in but this is just a matte brown
I don't know if you can even see that
but I really like that one a lot um but
yeah they're all in said this was the
one in a pickle that I bought
individually and this one is not as
pigmented as I hoped it would be when I
put it on my lid it just isn't pigmented
like it's just very light pink um I mean
it's okay it's just I wasn't what I was
expecting I was expecting to be a little
more poppy than it is but but yeah
that's that's my problem shows and I
honestly don't plan on buying any more
color pop I shadows unless they come out
with something that really calls to me
this is another one that I got in a set
this is called glow and it's just like a
creamy nude so this is a really nice
base know if you can see that what is
just a really nice face this one is he a
lot and have fallout for me so I'm going
to talk about those but those are kind
of my favorites when it comes to color
pop I hate that I can't give you more
advice on those especially on one that
you can buy single ad mmm okay sorry um
no Sita i'm going to say you're Sita

Tabitha Tabitha is high up and what's up
and make up food chain she's my website
designer and my friend and she she's
trying to get some things together and
help me out with things she's uh you
know helping me kind of produce the show
at this point she's amazing so whenever
we see Merlin full know it she's a great
person asked questions about all the
behind scenes stuff for what's been
makeup she doesn't do anything the app
but other than that she um she works a
lot of different things so let's see bad
candy beauty i want the kat von d felt
so bad but i just can't afford it oh I
don't know what to tell you well when
we're talking yesterday about budgeting
your money and then I don't know I don't
know everybody's situation is totally
different and prayers you're totally
different and there was definitely a
time when I could not afford those kinds
of things so I know where a lot of
people are as far as supporting high end
makeup and whether it's truly worth it
because if I would if this was ten years
ago I wouldn't be buying all of this
there's just absolutely away I I didn't
have I was in a situation where i could
buy it so i totally get you I totally
fill you um like when I was in college I
definitely lived off lifted noodles like
if I didn't if I I couldn't I that was
where I was I was going to college full
time I was waitressing full-time you
know over the summer I work 90 hours a
week so I totally I totally get that and
I don't know I don't know what your
personal situation is but we did do a
child last week on budgeting so I don't
know if there's some tips in there that
might be able to help you get but
there's more there's bigger priorities
that make up when it
sounds woods so all right how would that
you're funny okay sherry says this is so
much fun i love talking make up all my
friends and husband my mom are so tired
me obsessing over makeup you and me both
girlfriend they just don't get it you
and me both girlfriend we are all
kindred spirits that is so true who is
sexy me okay Sandra is talking about um
Sandra is at the imax toronto and she's
saying it's a small show but perfect for
her and her mother-in-law they got to
meet several ward wedding and nominated
artist and chat with them for a bit she
also got to meet stella from face off
that's kind of cool really cool ok but
anyway moving over here at yes it is
really fun talk about makeup e because
you know we have our passions and you
know there are things that we love that
a lot of people just don't get and it's
nice to be able to begin a community of
people that understand each other and
that's what I always hope the what's
gonna make a community will be and I
love that people trying to get to know
each other and starting to be friends
that have nothing to do with me like you
for developing friendships and doing
things that don't have anything to do
with me which makes me so happy like I
love it I absolutely love it all right
Marissa says what's good deed for the
Kat Von D shade and light palette there
isn't one that I know of I don't know of
one it's it's very unique very very
unique so it is actually 602 I just
noticed let's go ahead and i'm gonna i'm
just going to go to soraya real quick i
really want the market jacobs beauty
holiday pal but now that way you're
talking I want the kat von d palatine
even listen I maybe this instead I had
decisions and you know what the Marc
Jacobs i actually just returned a Marc
Jacobs palette you know one of the
longer ones not because it was a good
quality because you only get I think
there were maybe eight shadows in there
so I got six or eight shadows and for
the price it just wasn't worth it and a
color selection just wasn't a complete
palette for me and it just wasn't worth
it you know Marc Jacobs is really high
quality and really good really easy to
use I don't know if I'm ever going to
buy any more Marc Jacobs pallets just
because I feel it they're overpriced you
know when you can get things that are
ten twenty dollars cheaper than exact
same quality you know I'm Sam all right
um oh ya VES daughter and snow yay d I
actually tried
and loved it I've never tried their
eyeshadows I don't believe I can't
remember yes I think it's gate it's yay
it was it yeah be it might be yeah b-but
