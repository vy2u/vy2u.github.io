and I'm still not prepared so we're
gonna have you look at this beautiful
stuff and if anybody comes back just
tell them that I'm coming right back and
so I apologize for that
quick delay and happy Super Bowl Sunday
to those of you that are in the States
I know Lea it's like Ron Jan Roland we
were just joking the other day about
Forrest Gump and he'll when that movie
came out all of us Jenny's and
Jennifer's all had people going run
Jenny Brennan and where's forests and
all this joke to me that movie came out
it was annoying okay so anyway let's go
ahead and get started with our first
brand which is Revlon now this is a very
interesting quote from the founder of
Revlon his name was Charles
remson okay so here we go yeah rev sim
he's
in the factory we make cosmetics in the
drug store we sell hope what okay so I
don't know what kind of hope he was
selling I don't know it seems a little
bit overdramatic but you know I mean I
guess I mean I can see kind of where
that's coming from when you think about
like people who may be ill who want to
feel better about themselves things like
that I mean I don't know I don't know I
just think it's a little cheesy but
anyway we're just gonna keep going so
this is the story it says in 1932
brothers Charles and Joseph
remson along with chemist CR Lachman
would change the beauty industry forever
Revlon began with a single product
revolutionary nail enamel that came in
colors other than red soon the colorful
opaque shades were seen on woman's
fingertips everywhere including the
cover of Vogue so you know it's it's a
quote it needs drama Krista says that's
so funny
Stephanie says as in I hope this product
isn't terrible and Terri Lee hi Terri
so then they've got this beautiful
picture classic picture of Revlon
ad and it says Revlon's fire and ice
doesn't say when this was made so then
it gives a little bit more information
so it talks about the 1950s oh this is
Revlon calm by the way says from the
glossy magazine pages of 1950s from one
of the most talked-about Beauty
campaigns of all time for Revlon's fire
and ice lipstick and nail enamel during
the time when exotic foreign actress
like actresses like Brigitte Bardot and
Ingrid Bergman were dominating popular
popular culture the Revlon campaign
showed that American went show the
American women that she could be as
compelling and glamorous in everyday
life as any starlet on the silver screen
and then it just basically talks about
the different campaigns so here is for
the 1960s a campaign with it doesn't say
don't say who that actress that model is
oh my goodness here's a good one you
know some of you may remember these and
then we're talking about feminism in the
1970s oh the number one fragrance in the
world was charlie by Revlon over 40
years
perfumes youthful sophistication is
still sought after by women of all ages
and that was in 1973 the 1980s
transitioning for the brand's let's see
some of the world's most unforgettable
women including I'm on Claudia Schiffer
Claude Christina Crawford and Christy
Turlington so here's a Cindy Crawford ad
and then we've got the 90s Halle Berry I
see down there debuted the color stay on
1990s was one of color stage started the
brand ambassador was Halle Berry at the
time and it became the number when
number one long-wear brand what does
that mean long wear brand okay don't say
number one makeup brand they say the
number one long wear brand and then the
2000s it says makeup artist yu Shu Qi
West men join as global artists director
through April of 2015 and then they've
got this picture here more brand
ambassadors okay and then and then
that's it okay so let's go ahead and
look at some of my favorite Revlon
products where my box
so for Revlon really Revlon is a big
miss brand for me overall I mean it's
very rare that I find something from
Revlon where I'm like yes so awesome
amazing I don't know if you guys have
the same experience but the biggest week
for me from Revlon is the Revlon color
burst not cleverest Revlon balm staying
things okay so this is the lacquer balm
this is a balm stain this is a balm
stain I like the matte ones a lot I
really love this for me I feel like
they're just as good as the Tarte ones
they're very very nice the balm stands
are very long wearing um you do have to
kind of watch some of them as far as the
wear time like the way that it kind of
wears off your lips but overall I really
love these products I think they're
amazing I love the shade range oh my
gosh such an amazing shade range and
that they extended it beyond just the
one kind you know they had the shiny
ones and the matte ones and I think it's
pretty awesome you know that they did
that but this has definitely been over
or like three years of doing YouTube my
favourite Revlon product so I want to go
ahead and go into the collective brain
and I want to see what you guys think is
your favorite Revlon product christa
says I'm not big fan of tinted balms
I'd rather just put on my agave lip mask
overnight to help my lips not feeling so
dry Julie says invent your own makeup
category long-wear and you can be number
one in it great point
Julie and that's what I was thinking
Marlene says Revlon lipsticks are the
best and I love the color stay
foundational ecology a foundation is
very nice Beauty by Tara B says good
YouTube channel Revlon is very hit and
miss their eyeshadows are not good in
her opinion yeah I have not had good
luck with Revlon eyeshadows and this is
the thing it's like your Revlon I've
said this before if you're a rebel woman
how do you not make a good eye shadow
how does that happen you know how many
years have you been doing this since the
1950s and you can't make a good eye
shadow well actually that's not true
because a new palette that just came out
the new ones are not bad they're
actually pretty good I actually kind of
like the new palace that came out are
they high-end quality no but do they
keep up with my morphe shadows yeah they
kind of do maybe a little less than the
morphe I might be pushing it there just
a little bit but they're closed they're
closed they're getting there
way better than any other Revlon product
Liz says they're whipped foundation she
really likes and Stephanie says the
colors a foundation a foundation is
great for fuller coverage and the CD
divine says she knowing anything at all
um KJ says she loves the nail polishes
and Natalie says she loves the new
palette christa says yeah but the long
where it could turn into I can't get
these products off his then he says Fire
&amp;amp; Ice is still a great shade and tabatha
says I'm waiting to see who buys Revlon
they've been on the market for the Y for
a while
you think people have somebody been
trying to buy Revlon I don't know
Sevigny says they do have good polishes
and then we start getting into some
lorry knowledge Oh Nancy says L'Oreal
makes a great eye shadow why can't
Revlon I think he says I can't lie I
think of rambling like aside from real
nail polish they are known for cherries
in the snow they use pigment over dye so
they had better polish back in the day I
love cherries in the snow that's a great
shade what a great shade
Keiji says she hasn't bought Revlon in a
long time see like what is this why why
why lisa says the lipstick smells so
good and then Sarah says another vote
for the Colorstay whipped it's pretty
good elle whitney says i love the cream
blush as they came in the little clear
pots with the black lids but I saw that
they were clearancing out of Ulta so
Lisa Eldridge had met recommended the
pink one for deeper skin tones well
there you go and we'll do one more from
Julien there may have been a couple of
Revlon that scares over years that were
not bad but they tend to not give you
much product in the tube and a few more
votes for the Colorstay foundation on
the color stay with alright let's go
ahead and move on to the next brand the
next brand we're going to talk about
let's see in my list I'm so glad I went
got my phone I'm so glad you guys were
patient with me I am so mad at myself
because I tried really hard to be
prepared and I just fail fail i
prioritize coffee over the phone
alright so the next brand we're gonna be
talking about is Maybelline Maybelline
has a very interesting story this is
really neat this is from ABC 7 Chicago
dot-com okay December 16th 2010 this was
a press release okay it says did you
know that Maybelline Cosmetics
Tyrel in 1915 when a kitchen stove fire
singed his sister Mabel's lashes and
brows tongue while Williams watched in
fascination as May will perform what she
called a secret of the harem she mix
petroleum jelly with coal dust and ash
from a burnt cork and applied external
lashes and brows Mabel's simple beauty
trick ignited Tomlin's imagination and
the young entrepreneur started what
would eventually become a billion-dollar
business Tom while names his cosmetics
company Maybelline in her honor which i
think is so cool what a story it's like
I hope it's really true I hope it's
really true okay it says the humble
start to Maybelline empires the
beginning of a family saga worthy of a
TV miniseries in her new book the
Maybelline story and the spirited family
dynasty behind it Sherri Williams Tom
Long's granny's we relates the history
of the cosmetic company and the family
that built it so this I guess was a
promotion for the for the the book let
me say there's anything else of note in
here says she adds the four generations
of Williams relatives either work for
the company or were heirs to what they
perceived as its legacy glamour at all
costs I never like anything that says at
all costs that always freaks me out so
sherry says she wanted to show the
humanity glamour and the seedy other
side of a family intoxicated with a
quest for power wealth and physical
perfection for more information visit
Maybelline book.com so that's so
interesting very interesting let me see
I think I might have had another page on
Maybelline let me say no no that was it
for Maybelline so let's talk about some
Maybelline Maybelline is my favorite for
drugstore brand
Keiji says it's one of my favorite
drugstore brands it is my favorite
drugstore brand I think Maybelline is
the most consistent going with what you
don't read lines most consistent it's
the most it's very consistently not good
and I hate to say that but it's true
okay
and I think covergirl is kind of coming
up on them too but Revlon but Maybelline
I feel like they've got something there
may have a lean in L'Oreal kind of are
like actually they seem like they're
trying you know they're not
their legacy they're actually trying
Maybelline memorial where I feel like
Revlon and covergirl are just kind of
floating along line I mean uh let's go
ahead and put out another eyeshadow who
cares whether it's good or not
la-de-da-de-da I mean there's definitely
some some exceptions that rule for both
brands for both covergirl and Revlon
there's some exceptions so don't don't
get me wrong there's so many that's
putting love behind some of these
products but some of them it's like what
what what's what's like they like to
okay for example for covergirl for this
for example this conquer girl plum 5
last Pro I've seen one positive review
on this thing okay what they were
thinking they were like what what can we
do to a brush to make it crazy let's
make it bright red and let's twist it up
but let's put a bunch of junk product
inside the tube that's the way I feel
like covergirl and Revlon are but anyway
I'm gonna go ahead and go back to
Maybelline because I'm off topic so
Maybelline favorite products here we go
so one thing is the newer version of the
Maybelline fit me foundation the matte
and poreless really really love this oh
and Melissa saying the same thing right
here and then Stacey says Maybelline
face stuff is the best and lips
she likes L'Oreal for eye stuff is
saying it says isn't Maybelline L'Oreal
owned by the same company I think they
are yes and Krista says OMG i hate that
mascara oh it's terrible okay so anyway
this foundation is so so so so good so
good I put this head-to-head against all
my high-end foundations and I promise
you I could not tell the difference it
could not now this is the thing though
is you really only want to use this if
you have normal oily I've heard it's
terrible for people with dry skin so
just be careful there isn't one for dry
skin that's like a luminous one that you
might want to try I've heard good things
about but I can't talk about that
Steph says she wish Amanda says I like
that Maybelline has some foundations
with actual yellow undertones their
lightest shades actually match me and
the concealers are really good
so yes L'Oreal owns Maybelline Liz says
you have dry skin that foundation works
for you I also have dry skin really I'm
surprised because I've heard terrible
things about this for dry skin huh okay
next Mabley product that i want to talk
about because i have quite a few is this
one the new one that dream velvet soft
matte hydrating foundation this isn't
quite the right tone for me it's a
little yellow for me it does go on a
little bit patchy but if you if you
really look at it and work it it works
better I've heard that it works better
with a Beauty Blender I just got a new
Real Techniques sponge yes so I'm gonna
be trying it with the Real Techniques
sponge it's really I've been enjoying it
unless you looked super up-close like I
did in the one video where I was doing
the where test for this you really can't
see the trickiness
I really feel like it's it's because we
were like so all up in my face in that
video because on the day-to-day I don't
really notice as much streakiness as I
did for that day for that video I guess
because of the closeness so this I
really like this is a newer product
another one I really like is the lash
sensational excuse me excusing the
Maybelline lash sensational mascara they
only make some really nice mascaras like
really nice comparable to the high-end
mascara is mascara this is a fabulous
mascara oh my gosh it's so good and it
lengthens it volumizes
it's just really really wonderful I love
it I absolutely love it the new one the
new one the black one I didn't like
quite as much but now that it's aging I
think I might be liking it more I need
to play with it more now that it's aging
a little bit because I feel like the
formulas changing a tad bit but this is
a wonderful mascara and Julie's like I
love that mascara and then Diana says
that's my favorite and Marlene says
great lashes the worst ever made totally
agree I remember going in the store and
seeing great lash mascara and being like
why do I see this everywhere why have I
seen this this mascara I have seen this
mascara since I was like eight like I
remember seeing this great lash mascara
forever it must be amazing so here I am
at 17 or something like I'm gonna buy
some great lash mascara because it's got
to still be around for a reason and even
at 17 I knew that the mascara was
terrible but some people swear by that
mascara I mean I see it in the in the
like in the checkout lane
I've seen the Great Lash mascara in the
checkout lane by the candy and
mints and the gum great lash mascara
what I don't know I don't get it
ah but this one's a really good one this
one's fantastic really really good is
that all I brought from Maybelline that
was all I brought from Maybelline I know
there's more good products there's
definitely more good products I feel
like they're a little weak on their
eyeshadow I do recommend they're on the
pallets that Maybelline has for
beginners and for people that are just
kind of starting out and may cover
people that want really light looks
because you can create really gorgeous
very light natural looks with those
pallets it's just if you're looking for
that high-end pigmentation it's just not
there it's just not there but if there
is a market for it there is a market for
it let's go ahead and look in the
collective brain at some of your
favorite Maybelline products and this is
a way for people on the replay to get
more information from people other than
me because I definitely don't know
everything so let's look and it says
Sarah says my favorite Maybelline
mascara is a plush one love it stephanie
says the lash sensational gets better
with age yes good to know Krista says
they're lip products are amazing and
Ashley says the face studio master
highlights are nice too the luxury
hybrid says I feel L'Oreal makes the
best mascara and then Jenny says
Maybelline mega plush and then Chris's
says touch of spice is life and I
totally agree Krista the Maybelline
touch of spice oh it's so great if I
didn't have to dig for it I would go get
it but I know it's going to take me a
second to get it I don't want to waste
time so but yes amazing amazing amazing
Nicole says she likes the Revlon nude
palettes are the bomb the new ones the
new ones of brand new ones yes Julie
says the color tattoos are pretty good
now the thing about the color tattoos is
that at least for me I feel like the
only work isn't all over base for me so
for me if I'm not gonna wear it as an
all-over base it's not gonna work for me
I found that some of them go on patchy
like I remember there was one one
limited edition set where there was a
blue that was kind of foremost E and
then there was there were some that were
kind of they were just kind of frosty I
think they were going for the the foil
would kind of look and it just didn't
work they went on patchy I also found
that they dry out pretty good
only one the only one that has been
reliable and loyal to me is the bronze
one the bronze one has held out for me
and has been amazing I don't know what
they did to that formula of the bronze
one but it's so good it's so good that
one is wonderful touch of spice KJ is
the lipstick yes it's a lipstick shade
it's it's amazing definitely look up
swatches online and see if you think
that would be a good one for you um
let's see yes it is it's so good it's so
good
any other suggestions on Maybelline
before we move on to the next brands
stephanie says I do like their color
show nail polishes yes if it wasn't
right here but this is my favorite gold
nail polish of all time they don't make
it anymore it's called it's the
Maybelline Color show and this was
called a bold gold oh my gosh this is an
amazing gold nail polish it lasts
forever and it is so gold like it looks
like you have metal on your nails and I
can't believe they just continued this
thing this stuff is so good so good and
I cried when I found it they weren't
going to make this anymore so good
Krista says the concealers made this he
says age rewind
yes Maybelline instant age rewind how
could I forget Emily says the Baby Lips
chefs six yes absolutely yes mailing a
for my concealer how to miss that
Charlene how did I miss that
Stephanie says she's gone through three
bottles of it of this right here
yeah the age rewind concealer is
everybody's talking about that now Jenny
says the foundation that's like a
concealer with the puffs on the top sure
sure is easy to use if you're running
late very cool and Krista says the
better sting concealer is awesome age
wine concealers awesome and so is the
fit me concealer all awesome Stephanie
says and then right under Krista
Stephanie says any of their concealers
are great its money how you guys all
think alike sometimes that's how you
know you've got something good when
you've got fifteen twenty one hundred
and fifty three people in the room right
now and you've got you know
20 of them all saying yes the concealers
yes the concealers yes concealers that's
the purpose of the collective bringing
is when we figure out we all agree on
something we know we've thought
something there
you know what I mean let's see Stacy
says she uses the color tattoos in beige
on her brows that's very interesting
like a cream brow product very cool and
let's say see a Cyr says Maybelline
doesn't work other than the colors had
two pods okay is that the only thing
that you like is the color tattoos is
that what's happening Nicki says I like
their concealers but the fit me doesn't
last very long no um okay there we go
there we go okay so now that we talked a
little bit about Maybelline let's move
on once again I have all these products
because I'm sitting on all these
products I'll pick them up in a minute
all right so now the next brand we talk
about is L'Oreal L'Oreal is so good
there's so many good things and I think
it's really cool like thinking about
because I I you know I knew that
Maybelline L'Oreal on the same for the
same brand you know I knew that they
owned by the same people but you know I
never quite made the connection of those
are my two drugs favorite drugstore
makeup brands like I never I don't know
why I never never made the connection
alright L'Oreal a history at L'Oreal
calm okay all right it's reloading okay
okay there's a little pop-up okay so in
1909 Eugene Schueller
a young chemist with an entrepreneurial
spirit founded the company that was to
become the L'Oreal group it all began
and can't be Dan with one of the first
hair dyes that he formulated
manufactured and sold it to Perugian
hairdressers with this the founder of
the group forged the first link and what
is still the DNA of L'Oreal research and
innovation in the service of beauty so
L'Oreal started off all with hair dyes
that's all they had in 1909 alright in
1909 they officially became L'Oreal
and then they this is one of the
original L'Oreal ads let me see if I can
click on it if I can make it bigger let
me make it bigger okay okay it's pretty
small you can go to L'Oreal comm and
find this you see the blue that's one of
the first L'Oreal ads okay let's see it
was published in October of 1919
featuring contributions from doctors
writers and chemists and then the first
hairdressers showcase L'Oreal
participated in that that's how we sold
his first products in France okay and
then in 1920 is when they started going
international okay it says with the war
finally over a new age begins around the
world women are working or any money
growing more concerned about their
appearance
and seeking ways to prevent gray hairs
from revealing their age L'Oreal hair
dyes are now are now a great success
even beyond the borders of France
breaking new ground brought in Italy in
1910 Austria in 1911 in the Netherlands
in 1913 even reaching as far afield as
the United States Canada the UK and
Brazil let's see
and then I can't pronounce this because
it's in Spanish Spanish French 1925
let's see he made celluloid varnish and
plastics and they set up a company in
Russia let's see it's just saying
groundbreaking hair lightening products
with golden tints a tan or natural look
- blonde hair let's see there's a bunch
of different things here that I'm gonna
just kind of skip past but if you want
to see the full history you can go to
L'Oreal com let me see if there's any
okay all right we're just gonna go ahead
and stop there and start talking about
some products from L'Oreal but yeah so
1909 hair dyes yes
all right yes I did spin my cup on
purpose all right Lauria this is one
that they don't talk about too much that
I wanted to give a mention this is a
L'Oreal visible left blur foundation I
really like this foundation a lot I
never anybody talked about it feels so
good on my skin it feels so good it
feels so smooth it's not kind of a
silicone II feel let me see if it's got
silicone in it because it feels silicone
II does it happen
it doesn't have the ingredients in here
but it feels silicone e this is in the
shade creamy natural it feels so good I
absolutely love this foundation it's
it's nice it goes on really smooth and
just Oh
it also has sunscreen and it's got SPF
18 in it which of course is kind of weak
but still SPF 18 so I really really like
that a lot and I cannot get through a
L'Oreal video without mentioning the
L'Oreal infallible these things are so
good if you've never tried a L'Oreal
infallible just buy one you know go into
the drugstore find a shade that you know
you'll use and get one this one's iced
latte I have a few of the Giorgio Armani
eyes to kill same brand that my friend
Lily sent me and I swear that the same
the same formula I mean I think that the
the Giorgio Armani eyes to kill are a
little more complex they've added it so
that it's a little more unique wear this
is a champagne I have some swatches
sorry about that
they're hard to get off but an amber
brush everybody say hammer rush yes
hammer rush those are definitely my two
favorites iced latte and amber rush just
amazing buttery formula you have to make
sure you keep this little plastic thing
go it's really important to help the
product to stay good but oh my goodness
it even says do not discard on the
classic thing don't do that but these
things are so good so good oh my
goodness amazing
Julie sang she loves it visible lift
blur concealer - iced latte and the
inner corner Charlene says you are 100%
right I'm totally with you totally with
you yes right here right here
well at me what
franck 8kg what I do what I do what I do
today we try the crayons yet the
infallible crayons because I haven't
seen them anywhere nowhere the
infallible crayons I've seen them online
but I haven't seen them in stores but
last thing I wanted to make a mention is
the brand new product the Loreal brow
stylist definer oh my goodness oh my
goodness so amazing such an amazing
product I did use it today on my brows
it's just it's so good especially for
drugstore product I would never have
known this was a drugstore product like
if you can find your shade in this ain't
no reason to get a high-end brow product
ever again in my opinion it's just it's
perfect it the only thing that I my only
critique about this is the same critique
I have about the Anastacio in the it um
there's no product in here it's point
zero three zero zero three ounces
there's no products in here I mean it
does last a while but there's I wish
that there was more product I don't know
how they make more product in here
without making it thicker or they can
lower the price a little bit
I don't know this thing's amazing
amazing amazing amazing so we're gonna
go ahead and pop over the collective
brain and talk to them about some of
their favorite L'Oreal products I know
there's so many oh it's 10 bucks
this Loreal brow product is 10 bucks and
it's just as good as the anasazi so yes
Krista says I love the infallible
shadows I wish they make a pallet
version though Oh totally agree I was
just thinking about the other day Chris
that was thing about that same thing
Chris's says different Krista says
everyone is raving about the brow pen so
I think that Jen was the first discover
ahaha thanks it was it's really good
it's so good so good Nancy says did you
see the L'Oreal is using a new way to
test products no I didn't then go back
up
it's called Epis kin no i don't know
anything about that hopefully it's more
cruelty free because people get really
upset that L'Oreal is not cruelty free
um
the gene says the Loreal brow product is
so much better than the new maybelline
one with the powder on one side oh that
I never you know the ones with the
powder they never work for me never the
ones with the powder and that you have
like a sponge and you have to apply
powder nasty messy
I remember getting I think it was a
steal to one of that kind of formula
once it was terrible beauty by terribie
says a voluminous smoldering eyeliner
has not talked about too much but it
really works well and stays on my
waterline Nancy says it is cruelty-free
cool the new way is cruelty free because
they're getting a lot of thanks to
everybody who has given them a hard time
about it that's good I'm glad it is a
start that's good so very good very good
very good
let's see oh you know I've heard about
the the island what is it the Loreal
eyeliner that everybody talks about all
the time Melissa says love the L'Oreal
fara hair color what's the l'oreal one
the one that everybody talks about and
i've never tried
i don't remember it's a liquid the
liquid eyeliner i don't know
krista says she does like their
eyeshadows and brooke says I tried the
smoldering pencil because Nicole from
Young wanna polish swears by it and then
Tammy says infallible shadow and bronch
bronze taupe is beautiful and Nancy says
they use leftover human skin from breast
surgery to test the cosmetics Wow well
that's crazy so interesting Ali says I
love the lumi highlighter as well
krishna says l'oreal high lift creation
spray is great for volumizing my hair
without making it crunchy feeling yeah I
mean because L'Oreal makes so many
things it's not just makeup
L'Oreal you know takes the well no not
most one I don't know do all the other
brands do that I don't think they really
do like I'm sitting there trying to
think of like a Maybelline hair product
okay I'm thinking one Oh No but maybe I
don't I don't go into the drugstore buy
a lot of hair products because they get
a lot of samples so I mostly like go
through my samples for hair products so
I don't know it makes I'm really stupid
saying that and I apologize for my
stupidity if that sounds stupid Leslie
says voluminous superstar liquid
eyeliner is great maybe that's it maybe
this is what I keep hearing about brooke
says blinging it on is beautiful inner
corner highlight it's it's an infallible
eyeshadow and Charlene says in addition
to my manhole pores
I have oil slick skin Oh Krishna says
L'Oreal does a ton of skincare too while
others don't that's true that's very
true
70 beauty 101 tea
you do what I want on YouTube total
repair 5 conditioner so this says it's
not like they have boobies lying around
it's a process I'm sure it's a process
oh my gosh it is a little creepy though
it's a little creepy but you know you do
what you got to do to save the animals
you know all right so it's 10:35 I
wanted to move on I have one more brand
that I have prepared and we are only
halfway through the time so I don't know
what we're gonna talk about for the rest
of the time because uh you know maybe
we'll do some swatching or something I
don't know but I have one more brand
that I have prepared for you and it was
NYX so I wanted to talk about NYX a
little bit with you guys so NYX I
thought was very interesting it's this
is the founder of NYX I've never seen
her before
and I she's so beautiful it's like wow
okay that's so awesome her name is Toni
ko says when Toni ko was just 13 her
family emigrated to the United States to
open up a beauty supply shop and the
time Toni didn't speak a word of English
and that she was not allowed to wear a
stitch of makeup as an adolescent she
was fascinated by it and worked
alongside her mother to run the shop
where she gained a lot of experience
learning the ropes in the industry just
over ten years later at the age of 25
Toni's childhood fascination with makeup
blossomed into a business and NYX
Cosmetics was born offering just one
humble product eyeliner pencils after
years of frustration of the lack of
quality and many drugstore makeup
products Toni's goal with NYX was to
create the most high-end product
possible at a super affordable price
turns out the rest of the country craved
this niche as much as she did and as
first year business NYX generated over
two million dollars in sales since then
Toni success hasn't slowed down to the
nexus scene the addition of more
high-quality products from lipstick and
blush to nail polishes and accessories
and is now available in over 70
countries after seeing her company grow
up before her eyes and by her own hands
Tony sold NYX - L'Oreal just this past
summer I don't know when this article
was it's not in there what the what date
this article was written so although it
was a dream come true her decision to
sell a choice many owners business
owners face was harder than she
ever imagine these days when Tony isn't
spending her time supporting charities
and empowering women to start their own
business she's traveling the world which
she document document on her Instagram
and bring up her next the idea which
will just have to wait to see today
she's joining us to share some glean
wisdom and insight into our business
philosophy so this is at design sponge
calm and it's mostly the article is
mostly about her business and the
business side of things
instead of products so I'm not going to
go into the article as much because it's
really all about business so yes I
thought that was kind of interesting I I
didn't realize that NYX was sold to
L'Oreal which kind of makes sense
because that's probably how they ended
up in so many drugstores you know like
they were just in Ulta and then all of a
sudden they were all over the place so
flurry says ordering NYX online is the
best way to find and stock items flurry
sparks on YouTube as well Stacy says NYX
has an endless amount of products that's
so true so true Nicholas says wish we
had NYX in the UK I would imagine they
would get there because with L'Oreal
owning him I'm sure they'll get there
but yeah so NYX is PIM Charlene says
that Emily Noel says she can take or
leave the NYX strobing palette um so
this is kind of the way I feel about NYX
actually want to get one more things
right here this is kind of my thing with
NYX NYX is definitely hit or miss with
me and it's inconsistently hit or miss
but we're like you I know not to go to
the store and buy a rebel and eyeshadow
for the most part you know except for
the new palette the new palette is an
exception but like if I saw like a
Revlon and quad or something there's no
way I'd buy it with NYX they're so hit
and miss in their formula that even
within the same type of product you can
get really really terrible and really
really great and it's like I'm so
confused
it's like what Laura what lorac does you
know where you can get you know they're
like obviously different formulas the
pro formula is obviously a different
formula than what they put in some of
their other palettes and it's like I
don't I don't get it I don't understand
why they do that I mean maybe because
they're trying to mass-produce things
but
it's not it's not even like you can even
tell really which ones are gonna be good
and which ones are not gonna be good and
it's very frustrating because you know
like they'll have like that what were
the ones like in Paris and in in Italy
or whatever they were they not Paris it
was uh well I think it was Paris and
then there was like a Rome palette this
is horrible in my opinion did not work
well at all like I did not like them but
then they come out with like this this
was the goat the to go go to palette
lapel it indispensable these things were
wonderful
they're wonderful eyeshadows they're so
creamy and buttery I mean it's like
really how do you not put these
everywhere why why are you not putting
these in all of your palettes like why I
don't understand it so this is a
wonderful palette it's wonderful I wish
they made them all like this
um enough complaining about next one
thing that I do really like from NYX
that I haven't showed very much this is
the NYX dark circle concealer I really
like this it's kind of an oily
consistency though so if you have dry
under eyes you'll probably really like
this I have the shape fair if you have
oily skin you may not like this and also
if you have aging skin it does tend to
settle into fine lines a bit but if you
have just dry skin without worrying
about the creasing it's very very nice
it's very hydrating it's really really
nice Tara says they're discontinuing all
those small pallets well good as they
should as they should
Julie said Emily really dislike the
palette she only questioned whether
someone needed that many choices of
highlights but I say yes your beauty
junkie like else you do don't talk about
the new strobing palette I imagine the
other thing is when you're here in the
collective brain you get so much more
there's so much good stuff over
happening over here that I'm not even
reading another thing in the NYX blushes
the next blushes are very very good
they're really nice this one here is a
natural it is very very natural it
doesn't have a lot of pigmentation
unless you have very light skin but if
you do have very light skin or if you
like a very natural blush it's very nice
I really like this one I know it's weird
it's red it's called cinnamon I love
using this in December I know that's
very cliche to use a red blush around
Christmas time
it's like an orange e red and it's so
beautiful it's so beautiful for that
pale skin and the bright red cheek I
seen this on very deep skin tones and it
looks gorgeous on like really deep skin
tones it's just it's so incredibly
beautiful oh my gosh this is just it's
so pretty so so so pretty I really love
this sheet a lot and I love all my next
blushes like I've never found a NYX
blush that I didn't like I love them all
I love them all but again NYX is a very
hit-or-miss brand for me there's lots of
things like and lots of things I don't
like I mean one thing that can't go
without mentioning for NYX is the NYX
jumbo eye pencil in milk
how many tutorials have you seen with
the NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk as the
base oh my gosh like anytime anybody
uses a bright eyeshadow here comes the
NYX jumbo pencil in milk like really and
truly I mean everywhere everywhere I
mean it's it's just it's amazing okay
he's here okay I got both of these I
haven't two showed these much this is
the NYX sculpt in highlight face duo
in caramel and vanilla this is super
super super super super warm just be
warned I think I got the wrong shade I
ordered it online and I should have
gotten it in the store I'm really mad at
yet in the store and it's just it's the
wrong shade so I can't even make hitting
use this like at all at all like this
shade is even too dark for me for for
like concealing or anything like it's
just there's nothing I can do with this
it's too dark I need to just go and take
it back to Ulta because it's just it's
not working for me at all and I'm really
sad because I want it to do something
and I can't because I bought the wrong
shade but this year this is actually
very nice this is the cream a highlight
and contour palette by next and I'm
actually very much enjoying this now
again this is
little bit on the warm side but it's not
as bad as some of the other ones as far
as the contour the highlight is kind of
fun it's very um shiny eye it's very
white you do have to work with it and
blend in or else you'll end up with a
strip of white on your face so if you
don't want to work you don't want to use
this because it does take some work to
get it to blend into the skin to look
natural
this is very nice as like an under eye
brightener I've been using it for that
that's pretty much all I've used it for
but it is nice it's fun to play with
what I repurchase this probably not but
it's fun since I have it I'm enjoying it
but I probably probably won't get this
again but you know I think I ever get
anything twice
Who am I am I kidding even if I love
something I rarely get something twice
so that's it for what I wanted to say
about NYX I'd love to hear what you all
think about NYX and some of your
favorite products I know the collective
brain they've been just Chat Chat Chat
Chat Chat about NYX over here and I've
missed it all because I'm so busy
gabbing about my own stuff let's see CR
Cyr says Emily will Noelle says she
didn't like the cream contour because
they're too thick and it does not blend
but it looks nice you know and and it it
does blend I would disagree with Emily
on that it does blend it just takes work
you just have to work at it you can get
it to blend you know but you really have
to use your fingers to blend it like if
you're trying to blend it with a brush
it's not gonna work
you just have to gently blend with your
fingers and it will blend it's just you
know it's work its work it's not bad
it's just not great oh my goodness Diana
how could I forget about the butter
glosses oh my gosh the butter glosses oh
my favorite lip gloss product of all
time the NYX butter glosses so fun so
fun if you are looking for a subtle wash
of color on your lips and NYX butter
glosses are a great way to go like let's
say you've never worn a red lipstick
before never worn one but are really
curious about using some kind of red on
your lips get the NYX red
butter gloss a little wash of red color
to kind of warm you up to the idea of
wearing red on your lips without being
overpowering you know I mean so
definitely if you're it's I love the mix
butter glosses they don't last don't get
me wrong there's still gloss not
long-lasting but they smell really good
they're not sticky there are kind of
thick though so just be aware of that
um let's see KJ says she loves the
butter glosses Melissa says he only
glosses that one of the only gloss to
show where Shannon says I'm lazy I don't
want to have to work to make to to work
a lot to make my makeup work yes and you
really shouldn't have to you really
shouldn't have to Pandora says the matte
soft lip creams are awesome I've had hit
and miss experiences with the met soft
lip creams I find that if you can
reapply them or if you can bring up lip
balm in your pocket to kind of watch the
wearing off of it they're very very nice
but I feel like the wearing off of it is
really can be kind of messy depending on
the shade some of them wear off nicely
and some of them like I look in the
mirror at 12 o'clock and I'm like mmm
like what happened to my face you know I
just Nuala so I try to remember when I
wear one of those soft matte lip creams
I try to remember to put a lip balm in
my pocket and whenever my lips start to
feel a little dry I pop the lip balm on
and it kind of evens the color out you
know it's kind of and even the color out
a little bit as it wears down so the
next liquid Suede's the NYX liquid suede
are very sticky to go on very very
sticky but if you can get past the
stickiness you can get past it they're
very nice but it's that stickiness man
like a lot of people can't get past it
and I completely understand I completely
completely understand everybody's
talking about elf you want my coffee mug
alley they're on I'm have a press
they're on Cathy press you cannot even
buy one if you want one I don't make a
big Commission off of my make like this
much I think I make like 10% commission
but but if you want water so that's why
I made them it's because people were
asking you to make them so we can drink
coffee together out of our what's to
make up coffee mugs um but yes Thank You
tabatha for putting the link I
appreciate it
I haven't tried the lingerie ones
Pandora wants to know I haven't tried
the lingerie ones girlboss is talking
about the essence lip pencils I wish I
prepared more brands because I really
you know there's more brands to be
talked about let's see if I can google
elf real quick and let's see how elf got
started because I'm curious now now I'd
like to know please stand by and see if
I can find a good article all right here
we go
retail merchandiser dot-com okay I
haven't read this yet so I'm hoping that
it's good it's as a robot robust
internet strategy and a commitment to
low cost sets this cosmetic company
apart from the competition forward
thinking has helped elf cosmetics grow
to become a 20 million dollar company in
just four years let me said I can see
the date no there's no date okay let my
CEO Joey shamah the company is an
example of the startup of the future
which relies on the internet to move
quickly but supports the virtual
business with innovative retail
strategies elf is a cosmetics
manufacturer that sells most of its
products for $1 each that's not really
true anymore the company started with
just thirteen makeup products but it's
it's about more than 300 products SKUs
that include gift sets bath products
professional tools and mineral based
makeups obviously we couldn't keep more
involved products like those under a
dollar says Shama but we still offer an
incredible value over our competition
and that's why this brand that's what
this brand is about giving consumers the
ability to have fun and shop until they
drop we're back
there's no history though I was hoping
there'll be some more history it's just
more about the business so let me see if
I can find there's anything in here
about the history
it says alphas grown Martha can
word-of-mouth just online development
blah blah blah okay we said I can find
another article on elf it doesn't look
like there's a lot of good like about
the history I guess it's just a guy that
had an idea and that's why it's not um
like let me say let me go to Wikipedia
it's not my favorite source but we'll
see it started in 2004 100% cruelty free
supports PETA's no fur campaign history
and operations Shama was a 23 year old
New York University Business student he
teamed up with borer bug who was a 31
year old Los Angeles business industry
veteran responsible for previously
launching brands such as hard candy
cosmetics both were enthusiastic about
an inexpensive high-quality cosmetics
line for women and decided to form a
company together a few days after the
party I guess cuz I skipped a little bit
they sat down to brainstorm and a
business plan was created within months
we're but claims the idea originated
from seeing women with expensive cars
such as BMWs and Mercedes buying
bargain-priced cosmetics and 99-cent
stores in Los Angeles was officially
launched in New York City on June of
2004 also with these citizens assistance
of sha was father Alan so there you go
there's a little bit about elf
okay so let's spend a couple minutes
talking about elf so let me get alright
my favorite elf brush of all time right
here
the elf blush brush oh my gosh oh my
gosh this brush is so good so good I
love you know I think makes this brush
is the tapered point this right here
because all that product picks up
alright they're all around it's so good
and it's so soft it's so soft
and it just puts it it's a perfect size
just puts it right where it's supposed
to be it's like thank you elf blush
brush for being so amazing like amazing
uh amazing oh my goodness I mean look at
this this is this is really fugly and
this is my Real Techniques one that's
the the bold metals look at that they're
pretty much the same stick and idea and
this is what 20 bucks something like
that for these bold metals ones and they
feel I mean this is more dense this is
definitely more debt that's but they
feel the same this one just has more
density to it I mean this is definitely
a better quality brush overall but they
do pretty much the same thing but yeah
elf the studio line brushes are so good
so good I haven't tried the newest
brushes yet Oh
covergirl you know what covergirl on the
list and I completely forgot about
covergirl so let's finish up let's talk
to more minutes about that and then
we'll talk about covergirl I'm sorry oh
my gosh
you know I'm totally on me I do have a
page two pages about covergirl what's
how about cover go on second so let me
just talk a couple just very quickly
about some of my favorite health cards I
don't want to abandon it
the elf needed nude palette is wonderful
the elf contour palette is the powder
contour palette is my Holy Grail contour
palette isn't exactly Duke for that it
is amazing it is perfect it is awesome
the elf um the eyeshadow palettes in the
white containers or junk do not buy them
they are horrible and terrible they're
horrible don't buy them but the big
pants big black pans that are like this
on elfs website are really really good
so yes elf lip exfoliator for the wind
from tabatha absolutely and I do have it
over there but I don't know waste time
so yes definitely on the elf lip
exfoliator oh my goodness amazing on the
elf smudge pots i just recently
discovered tiffany john says yes they're
so so good and the elf sarah says the oh
setting spray is the only one that
doesn't irritate her skin and then
Brooke says I have I have nothing I love
from them I mean nothing oh maybe
covergirl she's talking about I'm
something she was up a little bit Brooke
was about the about that let's see I
think we're going into covergirl a
little bit so we're gonna go in back in
the covergirl because I completely
spaced on covergirl I was gonna talk
about and then I thought I thought I
didn't load another one but I did okay
okay so here we go covergirl this is
from wasp addcom I don't know it says it
was after world war ii when Noxzema
chemical company founded the covergirl
makeup brand in Baltimore Maryland shut
up for Baltimore and initially had only
six products in the offering like any
other makeup brands covergirl faced an
uphill battle and trying to bring the
market products which was primarily
composed of medicated makeup or what the
company dubbed as clean makeup the
product itself caught the industry's
attention and was awarded as the best
makeup company three years after it was
founded a couple of years later the
company launched what would be the most
effective and longest-running
advertising campaign of an American
makeup brand the same year it was
released the brand also catapulted to
the top spot among liquid makeup
products following its name the comp
launched the covergirl campaign where
and it's endorsers would appear on the
covers of various beauty and fashion
magazines but that's not all there is
for somebody to be a covergirl
the girl must have a certain appeal an X
Factor that would make her relatable to
the ordinary person but still someone to
be aspired for or as public relations
executive quits and everyday glamour
girl the images for covergirl ads had
one common denominator sure the girls
are prettier than one would see on the
street but their beauty is not so much
as to alienate the ordinary person from
thinking that the covergirl is someone
who lives in an alternate universe the
pictures are also easy on the eyes with
girls wearing clothes that are currently
in trend right now this is
understandable considering that the
target market reaches as low as
sixteen-year-old girls or jubal a sh
although targets the 21 and over though
I don't know what rejuve allows all
those targets 21 and over the lessons
learned here are simply incredible I
don't know what we're doing now is I
think I might have something to do with
the article let's see it's just pretty
much talk about Cindy Crawford and
Twiggy and she'll Teague's and all the
different famous cover girls I'm in 1989
Procter and Gamble acquired covergirl
from Hawkins an oxime a chemical company
the company maintained the image and
branding of their makeup brand
despite the change of hands covergirl
remains to be the same brand that people
have learned to love since it rolled out
its first products in 1963 yes they are
the same products that they rolled out
in 1963 update your formulas covergirl
please we're begging you update your
formulas it is not 1963 anymore please
it was some good makeup please oh my
gosh alright
Elise says she loves the Ready Set
gorgeous foundation you know I don't
think I own a single covergirl product
that I like and I hate to say that I
really don't amanda says covergirl
mascaras are the best I have had
terrible luck with covergirl mascaras
but so many people agree with meth and
with Amanda so many people agree with
her the covergirl mascaras are great I'm
a terrible look I don't know I guess I
just picked the wrong ones I don't know
people are saying the Ready Set gorgeous
line is fine that's not as bad Hanna
says update the packaging come on
governor I'll update your packaging well
then the new packaging there's a new for
any products that are you know updated
packaging terribie says out last three
and one foundation the new eyeshadow

mascaras either either of them Diana
says she hears the new true blend
blushes are good
Erika says does anyone like the new
sugar bombs from covergirl I haven't
tried those you know it's like a Revlon

products or Revlon product I'm gonna
grab a toward the L'Oreal the Maybelline
because they've been the most reliable
for me I don't want to waste my money
and I think that's what Revlon and
covergirl need to realize is they need
to develop some brand loyalty by
creating some really good products you
know it's just killing me man it's
killing me
let's see Anna says I only like the lip
gloss and lipstick from the outlast line
and Gina says I do want to try their new
sugar lip products I heard good things I
have seen those I haven't tried them kg
says CoverGirl's very mad for her
Tara B says redhead PhD to video
comparing foundation formulas and said
that the Ready Set gorgeous foundation
is very close to the double we're so
interesting if you are not following
redhead PhD on YouTube there's two
videos now she did one on liquid
lipsticks and now she's done one on
foundations you have to watch these
videos if you're interested in makeup
formulas and which ones are truly
similar and truly not this is not ass
watching video this is a type of video
that has never been done to my knowledge
on YouTube where she analyzes the
formula she analyzes the ingredients and
she talks about which formulas are
similar drugstore high end all different
brands indie she talks about all of
these different brands and these
different formulas to see whether you're
really getting your money's worth out of
an essay Lauder Double Wear when is
there a drugstore
and that is producing something that's
very similar in formula and it's so good
it's so so good
and it's very geeky and fabulous and if
you are a makeup geek like really and
truly and you like your interests and
stuff you there must watches must
watches wait I'm gonna say it again
redhead PhD so good so so good um so
Nancy says why do many celebrities
endorse the covergirl brand because it's
prestigious to be a covergirl it's one
of those things where you have to have
that X Factor and there's been so many
amazing people that have been cover
girls to say you're a covergirl is like
oh my gosh you know what I mean and no
one so I'm sure they're paying pretty
well really well so I mean all these ads
I mean they're they're getting made
their gain and I'm not saying that the
celebrities are in it just for the money
but when a big brand like covergirl
comes to you and says hey we want you to
be our next covergirl do you say no to
that I don't know I guess a lot of
people don't all right it's 1101 we got
