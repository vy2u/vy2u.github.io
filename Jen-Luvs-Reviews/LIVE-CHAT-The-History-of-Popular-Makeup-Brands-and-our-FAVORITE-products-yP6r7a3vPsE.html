products and things like that I don't
know how this is going to work with my
eyes not focusing because I can't read
the collective brain to save my life oh
my goodness oh my goodness all right so
let's go ahead and start off with one
that I thought was really really
interesting and that's urban decay I was
reading up a little bit about the
history of urban decay and I'm just
really really interested in it so it
turns out in 1997 was when urban decay
was founded by Wendy and also by her
name is sandy and she was co-founder of
Cisco Systems which i think is so
interesting you know to go from bare
into makeup I just think that's so
interesting she they bonded to get there
to come up with urban decay and they had
a love for bright colors they had a love
for things that you just couldn't find
anywhere you know all of the makeup was
all brown
like pinks and you know very neutral
kinds of shades there wasn't anything
loud and crazy they were like you know
what let's go out of the box and let's
get some bright crazy colors so I think
that's really really awesome that they
did that open nineteen nine uary of 1996
they started with a line of ten
lipsticks and twelve nail polishes so
and it says it was inspired by cd-r
facets of the urban landscape they bore
groundbreaking names such as Roche smog
rust oil slick and acid rain the first
magazine ad queried does pink make you
puke feeling the revolution as cosmetics
industry exclusives scrambled to keep up
so that is from the Urban Decay website
I think that's really interesting that
they you know they saw what was lacking
in the market and they just went for it
and they were like yes we're gonna do
this you know I think that's really
really cool
so some other things another article
this is you can find this on earth this
article and I'm reading right now on
Urban Decay calm shouldn't have makeup
all over my hands it's just gonna have
to stay there okay because you guys are
more important than me being crazy about
the fact that I have liquid lipstick oh
man alright so anyway so as we move on
from here
we're gonna go ahead into the allure
Beauty article about urban decay and
then we're going to talk about some of
our favorite urban decay products so
thank you so much and then Kaylee says
Helen I agree about the names but their
products are really nice maybe some of
their names might be a little too edgy
for some of you I feel like I need a
magnifying glass over here I just cannot
see so I apologize for sticking my
forehead in the camera Ida says your
eyebrows are on point amazing I bet you
can really see that when I do that we're
gonna go into toothpaste in a minute
hello in Michigan and Terri Lee is here
from Terry yay okay so this is an allure
article called six amazing things you
didn't know about urban decay and we're
gonna talk about these in a minute we're
gonna talk about it in the collective
brain aka the chat over here and then
you guys can feel free to discuss in the
comments below if you're watching this
on the replay and then we'll talk about
some of her favorite urban decay
products so it says number one urban
decay was created to rebel against the
abundance of pink makeup products on the
market and then and we just kind of
talked about that
and then number two the grassroot effort
paid off oh so they're talking about
Gwen Stefani so it says I would show up
at music festivals to track down Shirley
Manson and Gwen Stefani and get them to
try products is what Wendy said so she
would she would track down people that
she saw as edgy to try her products and
then it says number two the grassroots
efforts paid off Safari was one of the
earliest fans of the brand and she also
created Urban Decay's first celebrity
collection which of course we all know
just recently came out she spent hours
upon hours at her house with with Wendy
working out the perfect colors and then
I thought I think that's really
interesting you know it's celebrities
are not new to endorsing makeup products
but I think it's really cool that Urban
Decay bonded with Gwen Stefani but what
I think is really interesting is if you
look at when Stefani's makeup overall
she's not super edgy you know like you
think about you know the makeup style of
many celebrities and how it can really
get crazy like my thing crazy like Urban
Decay makeup
I don't think of when Stefani you know
she's so calm you know
Urban Decay was started at Coral Urban
Decay's I've been looking in the chat
was started in 1996 oh the volume went
away for a minute Oh mmm okay as long as
it's good okay so this would this is
very interesting it says number three
for the past twelve months
urban decay has sold one Naked palette
every six seconds and this was written
this article was written in December
10th of 2015 so this is very recent
article within a month so I think that's
really really interesting and it doesn't
surprise me at all and does it surprise
you because it definitely doesn't
surprise me so and incidentally 1996 was
the year I graduated high school I see
someone I was saying that that was the
year that they were born that was the
year I graduated from high school so you
know we've got something in common me an
urban decay significant years of 1996
all right so this is very interesting it
says the story behind the palette if you
had to take four eyeshadow shades to a
deserted island what would those
eyeshadow shades be Wendy told style
caster we threw them on the table and
they actually made a beautiful palette
so that's the story behind the original
Naked palette which i think is a really
really cool story you know to be like
alright which eye shadow shades could I
not live without let's just put them on
a pallet which just and that is what the
Urban Decay Naked palette is let me grab
it
all right okay I'll fix that later so
this is a relatively new purchase for me
so it doesn't look like I've used it
much because I haven't I got this in the
Urban Decay Naked vault at the holiday
time but I mean if you look at this you
can see that that was the idea behind it
and I feel like something with eyeshadow
pals especially neutral eyeshadow
palettes you'll find a lot of the shades
almost repeating throughout the palette
where you'll have two creamy matte
shades that are relatively light or
you'll have two shimmery deep brown
shades but I feel like with the Urban
Decay Naked palette with the original
every shade is unique in the palette
there's nothing in here that looks
similar to another that makes sense like
if you think about the Urban Decay Naked
basics palette shades repeat but I feel
like they really did a nice job
designing this and I think that's super
super cool you know I'm very excited
about that okay so let's go on to the
next one which is number four they
support the industry makeup artist and
anyone studying to become a makeup
artist can join the Urban Decay Pro
program for free and get 40% off of
products which I had no idea he's being
not a pro I think that is so cool that
is so awesome
did you guys know that I did not know
that I think that's so neat so then
number five is Urban Decay is the number
one selling eyeshadow brand in the
United States the Urban Decay
alice-in-wonderland Book of Shadows sold
out before even arrived in stores have
you even heard of that the Urban Decay
Alice in Wonderland Book of Shadows
I've got asked the collective brain
about that because I I've never heard of
that did that exist was that a thing
like what like I'm looking at the
collective brain and it's like I don't
know I don't know I don't know what
where that came from I'm gonna have to
look this up because this thing I didn't
know existed we have to learn more about
this said Alice in Wonderland palettes
because what all right I have all these
pages open for future topics for today
urban because I got to see a picture
that's been de Alice in Wonderland's
let's go to images let's see if we can
find anything no wonder it's sold out
holy moly wait you see this thing mm-hmm
I have to go over to the camera so you
guys can see this Oh wanna look at that
what what is that what what for people
to buy that wasn't very smart I would
have bought that in two seconds
mmm so cool okay let me see where in the
world we see if I can find the source of
this let me click over to the collective
brain have you guys ever seen this thing
oh my goodness it is like a big book of
shadows it totally is I'm trying to go
to the website where it's the the source
of it and this says February 23rd 2010
that's why I'd never seen it before
because this is old okay
it just says what an eventful few days
girls in the UK have had first the urban
decay house and wonderland palette went
on sale earlier than expected February
22nd then it son sells out in 12 hours
how disappointing but take heart ladies
today February 24th you can buy the
palette again online at Denman's
debenhams and the palette goes into
stores on February 28th remember they're
only 2000 mark for UK release so be
quick and good luck Wow oh my goodness
alright I was just reading the
collective brain and I'm laughing okay
welcome Naren
airings are welcome to you she said it's
her first he or she I'm not sure I said
that it's the first time here that's
very cool okay so that was back in 2010
now that we've solved that mystery we
can move back to the article where did
it go bourbon okay okay and then the
last thing that's on the in this article
says urban decay has a name library yup
real thing for naming new shades and
pallets we categorized them into like
sex names or drugs names and when you
think of a good name you put it into the
name library Wendy told style caster and
oh that's how acid rain and smoke became
color name so yes that's kind of
interesting very cool so what I'd like
to ask you guys at this point is your
Holy Grail urban decay products if you
had to pick your absolute favorite urban
decay products what would you pick for
me personally I would put um I would say
that the Urban Decay Naked 2 palette is
a must-have for me um recently because
of Cassie who I see is here Cassie from
thrift pick on YouTube she a Cassie made
me buy it the Urban Decay Naked is the
concealers the bought this because of
Cassie I'm terrific
when I had a blemish which I don't get
very often primer potion from Leanne and
Laura absolutely absolutely I had a
little guy here during before the storm
started we named him Nick Jonas after
the storm you know Nick and then just
storm Jonas and I covered Nick Jonas
with the naked skin urban decay and I
was like it was amazing and it lasted
all day long it's amazing so this is
definitely one that I feel like is like
Holy Grail status like amazingness and
the Urban Decay Naked 2 so I'm looking
here and then I used or eaten on my eyes
today count I'm Kayli is that Kelly
Kelly says she Urban Decay's Eden the
primer potion nanner says The Naked
original and the nascent Naked basics
original Nicki says the Sephora
concealer is supposed to be a good dupe
for the naked skin which is great to
know I'm it's going very fast
so I'm missing some things Aggies yeah
that's Gale I only on to urban decay
products the original Naked palette and
the perversion mascara both are great I
really the perversions there is a
wonderful wonderful high-end mascara so
I definitely recommend that one as well
if you're looking for the high-end
mascara I do feel like there are some
good drugstore dupes out there they're
just as good as the perversion but if I
had to say a high-end mascara that I
would definitely recommend that would be
one of them Danny says the naked 3 and
the primer potion Terri Lee says not to
not to for I'm not sure what the context
was I missed that Natalie says the
setting spray and then karen says
zodiacs Sara says urban decay's her
absolute favorite most purchased brand
and Deanna says she likes the primer and
the setting sprays krishna says I bought
the support Chelsea I'm concealer and
it's really good so going along with
Nikki on the Sephora concealer very cool
great to know great to know Karen says
the D slick setting spray equals I never
need powder and then rather rather be
dividing says the perversion and the
smoky palette and Terri Lee says the
Vice four is all she owes Terri Lee you
got it we gotta get you some more we
gotta get you some more absolutely Sara
Lee getting you some more urban decay
it's gonna happen maybe sooner than you
know it it's gonna happen all right
so let's see what are we gonna do so
we're going to now switch brands are 17
minutes in which means we can switch
brands and I what I did with my phone
because there it is it's hot all right
here we go
so let's go ahead and switch brands
we're gonna go over to Faced now I want
to talk a little bit about Too Faced and
the history of Too Faced cosmetics now
Jerrod Blandino the the face behind Too
Faced the head of creation
and advertising for two-faced she she he
sorry I was looking at a picture woman
he he is very open about the history of
two-face he talks about all the time he
is always around talking about those
things so it's knows this this stuff is
definitely not hidden this is
information found on the Too Faced
cosmetics website says two-phase
co-founder and creative director Jerrod
Blandino got his start behind the
department store makeup counter in the
mid-1990s this is like one thing I'm
noticing is a little bit of a trend here
the mid-1990 seems to have been the time
to be someone inventing a makeup brand
that will become awesome it's almost
like you know the Bill Gates time you
know they were all about the same age
all of those computer guys were all
about the same age seems like this was
the time to create a new revolution in
makeup says he quickly realized that
just in just a few minutes that just a
few minutes in the makeup chair could
transform and empower his clients he
recognized that makeup is so much more
than a little color on a woman's face it
is an instant mood booster a best friend
and a power Ally says Jerrod would spend
nights mixing eyeshadows with lipsticks
to make brand new products and days
testing his creations on clients women
loved his approach the products were fun
and feminine embraced beauty and
individuality not not makeup rules
encouraged by his makeup counter clients
women he lovingly called to face because
they would turn from sweet to sour if he
was out of their favorite lipstick
Jerrod decided to start his own whirling
so I remember watching interview with
him where he would say he would go
behind his makeup counter and he would
take some of the samples home and he
would mix them up and try different
concoctions and then bring them in and
try them on people so the people at the
counter didn't particularly like him
doing that very much which i think is
very interesting that he had he was
gutsy enough to do something like that
so it says Jerrod decide to start his
own line with only a credit card and a
vision alongside his new partner and
future husband Jeremy Johnson he began
meeting with professional makeup labs to
develop his products he quickly became
known as a beauty industry game-changer
inventing the world's
first glitter eyeshadow plumping gloss
and 24-hour crease proof shadow primer
which i think is very interesting
because if you look at the ingredients
for Too Faced shadow insurance and you
put them next to Urban Decay's primer
potion they're the first four or five
ingredients are exactly the same and I
think I calculated and I could be a
little off on this that somewhere around
80% of the ingredients are the same
between the primer potion and the UM the
shadow insurance I'm just saying I'm
just saying
and it says inspiration came from from
everywhere a classic movie a chocolate
facial in a spa in Hawaii the flush
radiance of a woman fresh off the slopes
though young Hollywood has fallen in
love with Too Faced jared has stayed
committed to the everyday customers who
support and help the brand become one is
today so there you go
very interesting okay so Terri Lee says
she has the semi-sweet pouch got it from
QVC and she enjoys it but she's in the
minority from what I understand I've
heard things ever a lot of people do
really like the semi-sweet palette it
seems to be that the original is the
favored over the semi-sweet for most
people but I think that a lot of people
do prefer the semi-sweet I think the
semi-sweet is a little more interesting
a color selection in that it's a little
more colorful there's a lot of different
colors and they're compared to the
original chocolate bar palette which has
a lot more neutral kinds of shades so
the next one that I wanted to read to
you was an article from the Allure
magazine again and then this is the Too
Faced cosmetics history five amazing
things you never knew about Too Faced
cosmetics so let me go get my chocolate
bar palette because I just want to smell
it this I actually used over top of my I
use the Garnier BB cream and I was
rushing you know how like when you've
only got five minutes get ready that's
what happened to me today my kids were
cleaning the house they need help and
also that's long story so anyway
only had like five seven minutes to get
ready today for filling I'm filming for
being here with you and I put on my
Garnier BB cream and I was like oh my
goodness I want more coverage than this
so what I did was I put on my Too Faced
cocoa powder foundation and this
modified my skin nicely gave me just a
tad more coverage and it smells like
chocolate like if you're the kind of
person who likes starting your day with
wonderful calming aromas this is a
really wonderful product I don't even
really hear anybody talking about this
it's fantastic I don't really use this
as a standalone product I use it cittÃ 
other cream products as kind of a more
full coverage face powder and it's very
very nice I love it I absolutely love it
but somebody's mentioning this Julie's
mentioned the Stardust palette was
wonderful I think that's gone now isn't
it though which makes me kind of sad
this is the Too Faced chocolate bar
palette this is I said it before this is
the me of eyeshadow palettes if you know
how like in the movie Beauty and the
Beast how they turn all of the all the
people if people work they're all turned
into like things from the kitchen like
if I had to turn into a makeup product
because it was a curse placed on my
house I would turn it to the Too Faced
chocolate bar palette but it's what I
would be this is what I would be this is
this is the most me thing that ever
existed I think like I love this thing I
love this thing so much so so much the
smell the shades the uniqueness the
versatility it's just an amazing product
but anyway we're supposed to be talking
about this alright let's go back on
topic Jen okay so here we go five
amazing things you never knew about Too
Faced cosmetics okay okay some of the
stuff we've already talked about because
it's in the other article it says that
they started the company specifically in
1998 and it says blandina used to work
at the Estee Lauder makeup counter in
Saks Fifth Avenue in the mid-1990s oh
that gives us a little more information
about that story I'm going to talks
about Too Faced and the customers and
all of that okay Too Faced created the
world's first glitter eye shadow and
this is the story behind that it says I
was in the lab
creating a black matte eyeshadow and
across the room was the lip gloss area
and there were these little jars of
glitter along this insane wall I was
like ooh ooh I want this so I ran over
and I grabbed the jar of glitter and I
brought it over to the lab lady who was
pressing a shadow and I said put this
glitter in the eyeshadow because let's
change the world and she said it won't
work because we need more binder so we
put in more binder and we put the silver
glitter in the black eyeshadow and baya
the first glitter eyeshadow it was
called luan and it was in our top 5
products for like ten years
seriously Blandino is a character even
as his own youtube series called it's
happening and that's relatively new if
you guys haven't seen Jerrod Blandino as
it's happening it's actually a very
entertaining show it does have some
curse words in there though he throws
them in there so just don't watch around
your kids that bothers you but it's a
very very interesting
YouTube channel so definitely definitely
check that out if you're interested in
it let me show you a picture of Jared
cuz he's just so cute isn't it durable
just a sweetheart oh my goodness just
seems like the nicest most down-to-earth
guy I hope that he really is like that
I've never met him so I hope he's really
like that and it says in fact Blandino
his passion for animals was the
inspiration behind the company's teddy
bear hair brushes he says you don't need
to hurt an animal to look beautiful oK
we've worked for years to make our teddy
bear hair brushes consulting top we've
makers on how to make synthetic fabrics
fabrics look and feel like natural hair
and then it says it talks about how
blame you know about the inspiration for
the best selling chocolate products from
a facial and they show a picture of the
chocolate bonbons talent there you go oh
and this is the story behind it he says
I was in Hawaii getting a chocolate
facial and was loving and the
moisturizing and anti-aging properties
of the cocoa I did a little digging into
cocoa and it's amazing for your skin so
there you go
ok so how are you guys doing over here
in the collective brain a sunshine
citizen says it sounds so weird to learn
that glitter eyeshadow is once a
revolutionary idea now it was so hard to
find a decent knock palette and Rosalyn
said how do people find out when you
look when you live feed I was
on the tail ends and miss it or miss
them altogether their scheduled times we
usually do it at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time
on every one every Sunday but the very
last Sunday of the month is 5:00 p.m.
Eastern Time so I try to keep it the
same every week Kelly says no glitter
for me
I left that behind in the 80s and hooda
says hey Jen so happy so happy to be
here so happy that you are here and then
dizzy Lizzy said dizzy Izzy Izzy Izzy
sorry glasses here I was interested in
two-faced born this way foundation but
I'm starting to see not only positive
reviews when it came out absolutely
every youtuber was raving about it um
it's the tooth is on his way foundation
is quite let me get it the FC website
when this first came out its he gave
these four points for FC points and
thanks to people signing up for my bag I
was able to get these I had the one in a
vanilla and the one in light beige and
the thing is is it's supposed to make
your skin look like you were born that
way it's supposed to be a more full
coverage foundation like medium to full
coverage foundation and make your skin
look natural as well but I honestly feel
like there's something about a flawless
face that there's nothing you can do to
make it look natural because people's
faces are naturally flawed
you know flawed meaning not looking like
one clean sheet of color because it
seems like the trend is for our faces to
look almost like a piece of paper like
one dimensional you know just well you
know piece of paper student you guys
don't I'm so sometimes over think things
you know just very flat and I feel like
this foundation does do that it gives
you that flat finish so it's not like
you're born this way it is a very nice
more coverage foundation I do enjoy it
the wear time is very very nice on it it
feels very good on the skin this is my
normal skin but I don't feel like it's
natural looking the way that it's
marketed you
I mean but it is it is a nice foundation
if you like a more full coverage
foundation so I definitely recommend it
for those those people but with my with
my normal skin I don't really need a
more full coverage foundation so it's
not as good of an experience for me as
it may be for someone with more typical
skin meaning tip skin that has more
discoloration than mine naturally does
so that's kind of my thoughts on the Too
Faced Born This Way Foundation let me
see if there's anything here and then
Leeanne says born this way look like a
mask on me Cassie from turistic says to
those are you asking I think it's really
meant for dry skin types maybe I have
combo skin but if you have oily skin
even the slightest it's very heavy and
gross feeling Taylor says ya know one
skin is perfect but it's definitely not
natural-looking I agree
let's see Felicia says hi Jen love your
videos oh thank you so much and Alyssa
says naturally I'm a tall every time I
see them I'm not sure what the reference
was I missed that the cost of it
honestly I don't know it's been a very
long time and actually didn't personally
purchase them so I honestly don't know
but it's it's sold it's a forest website
that I believe on all Chas website you
could probably check it out Jenna says
$39 and then Nikki says this is YouTube
brainwashing people real MUA don't like
the Instagram look bro makeup artists
don't like them Instagram look and we've
seen that with Wayne Goss and other
makeup artists on YouTube saying you
know that we need to kind of tone down
the full-coverage look of our looks and
not really go for you know that full
coverage I'm Kara says I love you I love
you too and then April says good to know
it might work for me okay so let's go
ahead and go on to the next thing and it
has to do with Too Faced bronzers it
says Too Faced has eight bronzers for a
very important reason when Blandino
sister was diagnosed with stage 4
melanoma he set out to create beautiful
and high quality bronzers so that women
would always have ways to achieve such a
sunkissed glow without sacrificing their
health and baking in the Sun lens you
know loves bronzers so much that in an
interview with makeup and beauty blog
Karen yeah I love Karen okay he spoke
about his wardrobe of bronzers if you're
not following makeup and beauty blog
there's a blog and there's a YouTube
Herron is amazing she gets everything
sent to her before it comes out so she's
got cutting-edge information amazing
amazing blog amazing YouTube channel and
such a sweetheart he spoke about his
wardrobe of bronzers I have dif a
different bronzer for every tip for
every different outfit he says every
different time of year every moment it
depends on where I'm going what I'm
doing I've built a bronzer wardrobe that
I'm absolutely addicted to and will
never give up and you guys know that
he's done the bronzer the bronzer
wardrobes he's done those so one time
Monday I want to get more than just the
bronzers that I have buy them let me get
the bronze I should have gotten products
out I had a time I wasn't planning on
pulling products out so amazing oh my
goodness in preparation for this video I
wash the least I know the soft topic the
Lisa Eldridge video about the history of
makeup you have to watch that video it
is so interesting even if you're not
subscribed at Lisa Eldridge even if
you're not interested in these others if
you are interested in makeup you have to
watch the history of makeup by Lisa
Eldridge it's so good so this may take
me too long to dig through my drawer to
find it and I don't want to sit here and
just dig while you guys wait that's just
not very nice so Holly says I have the
book of bronzers but I reach for that
makeup for ever Pro bronzed fusions and
she's got kind of a moon face I'm 70
says can vouch for the bronzers love
them gave me color when I was sick if
you're thinking about getting one get
one Helen says I love the Easter Lisa
Eldridge book but haven't read it yet
and Tanya says the book of bronzers is
good for paper is it good for paper pale
skin
I would imagine because the bronzer is
overall like I have the chocolate Soleil
bronzer and I think I have one other one
the Sun bunny bronzer and both of them
are very buildable so they go on quite
light and then you can build them up
it's not like like benefits hoola goes
on like that it's like really really
deep really fast so the Too Faced
bronzers really build up slowly
nicely at least the ones that I have
ever tried excuse me who's a chuckle off
says Lisa Eldridge I Jordan Liberty are
so good
agree agree agree agree Lauren W says
also paper pale I use the chocolate
Soleil if I'm very careful very careful
all right let's see if there's anything
else that's the end of this article so
let's go ahead and keep talking about
some two-faced products that we know and
love and we'll have time for one more
brand after this I believe Polly says my
favorite bronzer ever is the Giorgio
Armani liquid and Stephanie says the
Lisa eldred's thing she was talking
about is that book or YouTube video whoa
what I was talking about is the YouTube
video I know there's a book that goes
along with it I think that she did the
video to go to promote the book but it's
really really interesting video it's
only about three minutes long and it's
so interesting so alright better than
sex mascara summer says the better than
sex mascara for me with a little bit
clumpy but but this is big bud here okay
big but here in the better than sex
mascara is that it gives length and
volume you just have to watch the
clunkiness of it I think I feel like it
King it can definitely get kind of out
of control the brush the way the brush
is built the the wands the bristles on
the wands are very close together so
sometimes they can collect product I
feel and I feel like that's what kind of
makes it clump is when there's too much
product on the brush so you can always
kind of wipe your brush off a little bit
on a tissue to kind of get some of that
off but then at the same time then I
feel like I'm wasting my mascara when I
do that but does help for a better
application so Emily says I didn't care
for the better than sex mainly because
it's not waterproof my lashes weight
fall without the waterproof summer says
waterproof better than sex will change
my life it is coming it's in a blue tube
baby blue tube it's coming at Kelly says
Steph Zilla everyone is different girl
it's okay I love how you guys support
each other Coral says I accidentally
swept too much powder in the air and got
some in my mouth I hate it when it
happens except for the two-faced one and
I it's not so bad
BAM be fabulous I own so many two-faced
products I love them all the cocoa
contour is my favorite I need to get
that I need to get that and Maggie says
Jan I know I keep repeating but Cathy a
has a playlist of in-depth hits from
history of makeup of many brands it's
amazing and then she does a whole face
of the brand Maggie you know what I did
Maggie Maggie I thought that was Nikki
that told me that so I asked Nikki this
morning Nikki send me the link to
whatever you were talking about about
the history of makeup but it wasn't
Nikki it was you Maggie and I apologized
Nikki that I thought it was you but it
was Maggie
so now I know I've spread the comment
out loud I can go back to this video and
I can find that because I was looking
for it and I couldn't find it I couldn't
figure out where oh oh my goodness all
right bless your hearts and I am NOT a
fan of the melted lipsticks they
separate and I keep just getting some
Gracie stuff out with no color side note
they are new so it's not just because
they're old oh okay gotcha the melted
lipsticks I do know where those are
these are the new chocolate ones I
really like these honestly I like this
formula except for this is the Mitaka
chocolate diamonds I didn't like this I
did put a little car here if you look
there's a little eye in the corner if
you click on that you can click right
click on the video to watch later of my
two-faced review of this stuff and some
other I think it was just lip products
including the unicorn tears and some
another one of the the la creme
lipsticks so there's a full review that
you can watch if you click that little
eye in the corner um but yes oh that's
over here it's over there not over there
it's over there um but anyway I actually
really like these except for the
chocolate diamonds I don't know what
they were thinking on this one because
it's like straight-up glitter on your
lips but um Oh Janet Andy kitty one says
um Wayne Goss says awake your mascara
brush every time who knew I thought
waste my product
oh no Rebecca says I have a small lips
and the melted lipsticks near too much
for me get them
properly defined so I have peony which
is from the original launch and I think
I have one more oh I have one of the
melted metallic one the one in debutant
and I like the debutante better than the
peony the peony I did not enjoy the
formula I actually really liked the
debutante for a while and it's funny
because I was watching um was Emily Noel
83 she did like her recent fails of of
2015 or whatever and she had debutante
as one of her big fails because of the
frostiness of it and it made any
imperfection shine but I have really dry
lips
I didn't notice imperfections from that
product like over over the top in from
imperfections I don't know it's been a
while since I've used it though so maybe
that's a hint that maybe maybe it wasn't
as good as I thought because I haven't
used it in a really long time but I
really enjoy enjoying chocolate
milkshake and then there's the other one
that's a little darker that's you'll see
it on the website you'll see it and you
can see it in the video I forget what
it's called but I have it in my purse I
think the other one that's um more of a
matte finish not totally matte does have
some shine to it but a little more matte
okay so what we need to do now is we
need to move on to our final brands
which you guys know in the collective
bringing more about than me but I
thought we could talk about Mac I
thought that could be our last brand and
I have of course another allure article
because a Laura is amazing as far as
articles 7 surprising things you didn't
know about Mac here we go
all right you may be the kind of Mac fan
who at any given moment owns no fewer
than five Ruby blue lipsticks just in
case it never good just in case it ever
goes out of stock or you may be the kind
of Mac junkie who glues herself to a
computer constantly refreshing the page
anytime their newest limited edition
collection launches but even the most
die-hard fans will be surprised by these
7 facts about makeup art cosmetics that
is the real name of Mac makeup art
cosmetics which I did not know that's
what it stands for and then it says
which is what Mac's dance pro by the way
but of course you already knew that I
did not know that I did not knew that
Matt was founded when a makeup artist
and a photographer became frustrated by
how bad most makeup seemed to read
photos in 1984 beauty salon owner Frank
Angelo and photographer Frank Tuscan
created MAC Cosmetics in their kitchens
to fulfill the professional makeup needs
they decided to package their products
and black paths instead of compacts and
that quickly became the company's
signature interesting number two one of
Mac's first big breaks occurred when
Madonna wore its lipsticks according to
max website Madonna wore an intense
matte red lipstick on a photo shoot in
the late 1980s she was later
photographed wearing a Mac t-shirt and
people began to take notice of the
company so and that hasn't changed at
all because they really do rely on
celebrities to do a lot of promoting for
their brands they do a lot of things
with celebrities and I feel like that's
like their thing is working with
celebrities and then coming up with
lines with diff celebrities all over the
world so the next one is number three
RuPaul was the first Viva Glam
spokeperson in 1994 did you know that
that it was RuPaul and then he got a
cool picture of RuPaul oh I probably
shouldn't show that because she's in
some crazy positions go to the allure
magazine website if you want to see this
one because she's got some weird things
going on I can't show this on this
channel this is a g-rated channel maybe
PG alright next one says since its
inception in 1994 Mac's Viva Glam
campaign has raised over 380 million
dollars the program began as a way to
raise awareness about HIV and AIDS at a
time when it was largely misunderstood
and this and underrepresented now the
company is a pioneer and hiv/aids
funding at the largest corporate
non-pharmaceutical giver providing
support for the Cure
most of those celebrities have been
involved in people clam campaigns
including Lady Gaga Nicki Minaj Miley
Cyrus and most recently ariana grande
you guys know this stuff
max sells more lipstick than any other
non drugstore brand that's according to
research conducted by the NPD group in
2012
Beata both Lancome's Absolut Rouge and
Estee Lauder's pure color lipstick so
mag is sold in 106 countries and
territories very interesting
very interesting fix pluses your Holy
Grail Jenna says Steph says the only
thing I like are the pro longwear
concealer and the fixed plus and the
lipsticks Sara says no Mac for me not
cruelty free okay number six makeup
artist can sign for a special program in
the company with the company and get 40%
off net products with the Mac Pro
membership program so today makeup
artist you show proper certification can
pay $35 a year to become a member of the
program pretty cool doesn't you know
maybe I need to enroll in some kind of
makeup school and actually teach myself
some not to actually be a makeup artist
than anybody else but just to learn you
know just to sit back and learn things
and get 40% off in urban decay and Mac
okay
number seven one man is largely
responsible for creating all of the
color concepts of for the brand in 1998
Estee Lauder bought Mac interesting and
then in 1999 a man named James gagger me
Gabe became the company's creative
director I'm assuming I'm saying that
correctly I don't know though I'm just
can't look it up right now
he's responsible for thinking of all the
colors of promotional materials
surrounding the brand his philosophy
behind creating that products I don't do
pretty i don't like pretty and frankly I
find things that are pretty to be very
boring seems to be working out so far
which is interesting because Mac has a
lot of pretty stuff
you know like you think about some of
the Mac collections they are very pretty
like I don't I guess maybe the talking
about like the black packaging and stuff
isn't very pretty but I don't even oh ha
Lee says it doesn't work like that
anymore gen they took my pro discount
away and summer says you get a discount
at Mac counters inside Macy's if you use
the plenti points reward program oh man
okay and then BAM says Jenna I believe
if your channel is big enough you could
get a pro card I don't know I'm wrong no
I was because I was talking on periscope
to the guy from IMATS and he said no it
said you get I think I was like because
he was saying for pro card holders and I
you could do this this and that and then
somebody had asked him I didn't say
actually I don't think it was me I think
was somebody else me it was me
can't remember like jokingly said you
know what if I have a successful YouTube
channel and he was like now even though
my channel is not in the way he's
successful like most channels that are
considered successful are but I was just
cherry as you know I was just curious
not that I would qualify but I'm just
curious Sasha says Jen that would be
cool thinking about it yeah
let's see Caitlyn says random question
is anyone ever tried the bare metal skin
longevity of a towel powered infusion I
haven't and then let's see okay so I'm
trying to look okay Kelly says my
channel is great thank you and then
Brianna says my favorite product of
theirs is the dazzle glasses in the face
and body foundation I also like the
stroke cream in the fix plus you get
more into the shadows and face powders
okay so let me go ahead and see if
there's anything else so that's the end
of the article there so we can spend a
little bit of time talking about Mac
products and your favorites and I know
they're not cruelty free but some people

flamingos flamingos collection came out

permanent but man they look beautiful

don't know I don't know so yeah
stephanie says pan Tina is so beautiful
oMG I'm the chief a setting spray is

skinfinish and natural and painterly I
forgot about that too the mac mineralize
skinfinish and medium that I have I
absolutely love that is a really finely
milled powder it's really really nice I
really like that one a lot
alright we've got seven minutes left let
me see if I still have that article up
that I thought was really interesting
let me say not a minute if I can find it
real quick let's see let's see
worst moments in makeup history I
thought this would be interesting this
one was how I found that Liz Lisa L
drink out Lisa Eldridge actually you
know what you guys can just watch that
but one thing I thought was interesting
in this article it says did you know and
then in ancient Greece wearing any kind
of makeup was frowned upon because
according to Eldridge the male elite
believed the woman's the main role in
life was to be virtuous and to stay in
the house and in the 16th century Venice
aristocratic women
coveted expensive and highly toxic
products as Eldridge puts it the more
you use the more you had to use so they
were talking issues talked about in the
video how you know this foundation was
so perfect and made your skin look
perfect but then like it ruined your
skin because it was toxic and the same
thing about I think she's saying some
blushes and stuff that they used back
then were actually toxic for the skin
which I thought was kind of crazy yeah
this turned out to not
that great of an Oracle except for that
it led me to at least the Eldridge
history of makeup video which is awesome
so and summer says stay in the house
hear me roar boys and then Holly's
laughing and Emily says I think I've
seen that video it is really really good
okay so we've got about five minutes
left we don't have time to go into
another brand but we can talk about
whatever else you guys want to talk
about I in the collective brain any
other things that you're interested in
anything else you want to talk about
Erica says maybe that's where beauty is
pain came from that maybe maybe and
Gwendolyn says worst times in makeup
history was me the age of 13 using
electric blue eyeshadow and you know
what's funny is I miss the 80s and
makeup I got into makeup when I was in
the seventh grade it was 1991 and my
thing was heavy metal hair bands and
black eyeliner
that's all I wore was black eyeliner
right here somewhere I'm gonna have to
find I have this picture of me with my
big poof and my black eyeliner that I
took in a photo booth at the mall with
my friend and it's like still to this
day one of my favorite pictures of me of
all time with my black eyeliner in my
big poofy hair but that's all I wore for
the longest time I don't even know when
I started wearing other makeup I want to
save in high school I must have started
putting on a little bit of blush and a
little bit of mascara a little bit of
eyeshadow but it was never a bot I never
really got into makeup especially
lipstick I never got into that until I
started YouTube and you can go back to
my very very first video is the what's
in my makeup bag and that was my entire
collection my entire makeup collection
was contained in one bag that was this
size and you can see every single
product that I owned at the time very
soon after that you see that I got my
Urban Decay Naked 2 palette and it
changed my life basically change my
makeup life change my makeup life so
faith says Jen recreate your 80s look I
didn't have an 80s look because I didn't
wear makeup navies I was too young I was
in elementary school
so I didn't have one of those Lauren
wants to know Jenny going to IMAX New
York City can I hug you at yes and
absolutely please do that would be
wonderful
I would love that we could take pictures
together and put them on Instagram and
we'll have fun
absolutely I'm Cathy says Jen got the
wetsuit and makeup mug love it yeah I
love my what's been makeup mug - yeah
that's awesome
Tina says honestly I'm still not into
lipstick not like other things anyway it
seems so high-maintenance I know right I
know right and Jeanette said sixth grade
was purple eye shadow in red lips and
then Kate Lee says Jen thanks for
sharing your makeup story absolutely
absolutely it's going really really best
and then Holly says that's funny I
started collecting after I bought the
naked - me too me too that was my big
thing but I had already actually started
my makeup channel before I got the Naked
- I don't know what I was thinking what
I thought I was gonna talk about I guess
maybe I figured I would just purchase
makeup and review it even though I
didn't know what I was shopping about I
kind of figured it out as I went you
know I've always been kind of a science
kind of person like really liked
experimenting and the whole scientific
method of things like I've always been
interested in that and enjoyed the
process of scientific discovery of
things you know of trial and trying
something out in like a scientific way
where you know you make sure that
everything else on your face like this
is why I don't do a lot of skincare
because everything on your face like
like what I try to stink here product I
only change one skincare product one
because I want that to be the
independent variable you know I want
that to be the thing that doesn't change
you know that the one thing that changes
excuse me the one thing that changes so
it takes me forever to review skincare
because of that same thing with makeup
like when I do like when I try a
lipstick like right now I'm wearing the
Stila stay all day liquid lipstick I
forget what shade it is but I have a lip
balm over it so I can't review this
wearing of my liquid lipstick except for
as a liquid lipstick with lip balm over
it and that's really really important to
me Erika will do a series collective
brain hug but but yeah I mean that's
really important to me to have validity
in my reviews and not mess with things
and if I do do something different like
wear a bomb over my lip product you know
I make sure I include that with my
review because
think that's super important I don't
think that everybody that reviews makeup
does that I think a lot of people do but
I think I don't think everybody does you
know
Cat Cat Oh kate says Jen I was just
wondering if there are any ingredients
you avoid no there aren't there aren't
and I know that's probably bad
poison ivy I don't like poison ivy and
my makeup um you know like I know that's
probably bad but it's not like I don't
know like you know the only thing that
freaked me out was when I found out that
there are some skincare products that
have snail slime in them that freaked me
out a little bit but other than that
somebody says I've never been to IMATS I
feel like would be so overwhelming for
me and I like to be introverted with
IMATS though I mean if you've ever been
to any kind of convention IMAX is like
any other convention where you know
you've got booze and you walk around and
you shop and you know it's not at least
for me it's not super overwhelming in
that like I don't know I just feel like
it's just the place to shop almost like
going to the mall or going to like a
yard sale or something where there's
like what at the community yard sale
where there's lots of tables but things
are a lot more expensive you know but
yeah I mean it's just know Deana says
apparently snail slime is supposed to be
very good for you that's true but it
still freaks me out she can't do it I
can't do it
Shannon says any mascara that's not
cruelty free bothers my eyes not sure
why I'm not sure why either rather be
devided diving but dividing rather be
diving alcohol can be damaging to the
skin I have heard that I have heard that
Alyssa says snail is bomb don't knock it
so coupons are bomb of silk cocoons
coupons silk cocoons are bombed - oh
very cool patty says I need to drink
more water you and me both girlfriend
you and me both Helen says the yard sale
of makeup green advertising I know right
Helen
I just have a way of wording things that
make things sounds so appealing and you
know says you don't even want to know
where the vanilla flavoring comes from
oh don't even tell me don't even tell me
I know there's like beetle
and like the shininess on M&amp;amp;Ms and stuff
like that bat poop mascara what are we
talking about oh my gosh
