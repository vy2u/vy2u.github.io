tutorial at the same time so I'm gonna
press play alright this is from the
1930s and there she is look at her
beautiful hair she wakes up isn't she
gorgeous oh and our makeups already done
and everything oh I'm still on the wrong
tab tabatha says I'm still in the wrong
tab it says that I'm not on my thing oh
man come on all right on a second how
about that it's other than telling me
she says I'm still in the wrong tab
how's it looking now mother writes have
now you see this beautiful lady we got
to go over here it's called daily I am
on their tab thank you for your patience
this is probably the worst live chat as
far as functionality than I've ever done
yes okay stay there okay all right here
we go so Constance Bennett daily beauty
rituals photographed in cinah color here
we go okay so as I was saying now you'll
actually be able to see it hopefully
okay there's her alarm clock apparently
it's gone off and there's her and her
gorgeous hair look how beautiful my
Herod oh my goodness she's so gorgeous I
did hit play tab should be playing this
is gonna be horrible to go back and
rewatch is it playing right now I'm
hoping it's playing so she's using her
cleansing cream cuz apparently she still
has makeup on she needs her cleansing
cream
it doesn't grow fuzz well that's a good
thing oh so she has a maid she has a
maid that's prepared her a bath if we
all had one of those a simulation cream
I wonder if that's like a toner she
could just go on for hours so she's
taking it off now taking off her
stimulant cream he only just going in
the bathtub with her hair like that it's
gorgeous complexion mask see we still
use those we still use masks he's like
shut up I know it's ready you told me
that five minutes ago all right do you
know she still has makeup on what is up
with that her maids really annoying I'm
kind of glad I don't have one of those
because we're always on parade right
trying to look beautiful for everybody
else cream Rouge didn't share you
wearing blush look she's got a contour I
don't see anything different well no I
guess I can see a little bit it's kind
of like an orange e color she's pouting
but look at those eyes and lips she had
that on through the whole bath nowra
lipstick you've been wearing the
lipstick the whole time waiting to be
beautiful and natural is the birthright
of every woman good luck good luck to
all of us the end alright so I'm going
to close out of that and get you guys
back and let's have a little discussion
about what just happened hopefully you
guys could hear it um I I just got a
text from tabitha that you guys were
having a little bit of trouble hearing
it let me see if I can get back over to
me and seeing myself is this it no I got
to find the right window here we go okay
so we're gonna stop screen sharing
hopefully on a minute can you guys see
me I don't know if I don't think you
guys can see me chat no one I met I
cannot find you I lost you there you go
okay so we should be able to see me now
okay jonatha said you guys were having a
little bit of trouble hearing some
hoping you could hear me enough or hear
the audio enough okay could you guys
hear me commenting on the video as it
was going or could you just see the
video cuz i was commenting the whole
time you couldn't hear me ah ok ok so i
wanted to talk about that a little bit
oh you could hear me no you couldn't yes
you can didn't hear the video at all yes
you could hear me it helped a lot ok you
see me we can hear you very well cool
this isn't working we can't really hear
anything hold on Matt let me go back up
can't really hear anything might be more
fun to talk about makeup from different
errors or maybe we could pull up
pictures on our screens instead of video
ok this is what we'll do is for the next
one I'll pull it up on my phone and I'll
just show you and then we'll comment and
see if that works so we'll try something
else I know sentient Holly says thank
God some of us care about ourselves
these days I could hear you just not the
video ok cool alright that's good too
the video was a little blurry ok well
you can go there's a link to the channel
down below in the description so if you
want to watch them again you can always
watch him again so we'll try the next
video a little bit differently so I
think the biggest thing that I noticed
is the emphasis on cleansing her face
she was really being in the cleansing
her face but it was interesting how she
had her makeup on the entire time so I
don't know what that was I guess maybe
you know women just didn't have more
comfortable enough to wear makeup were
to go to be on camera without any makeup
at all or maybe the men that were
guiding the makeup tutorial felt like
she needed to be wearing
make up the whole time um okay thank you
vicky for the UM for the feedback yeah
you know when she woke up with her hair
all perfect and everything I think it's
just funny how you know the expectations
have changed for women you know that
women she obviously had to wear all of
that through the entire thing even when
she was in the bath um she says she only
cleanser she mary says showing cleanse
her cheeks not her forehead that's true
and I think it's because she already had
makeup on her forehead and i love the
maid the maid was cracking me up the
maid was like like basically being her
second brain like she was too dumb to
know that she had like something she had
to do I just thought that was really
funny like how she needed the maid in
order to do what she was supposed to do
you know like such it's such a strange
thing this was from the 1930s um yeah
just just very odd and then you know
about the UM you know putting the
lipstick on but she had lipstick on
through the whole thing so I thought
that was really funny really funny so
any other thoughts from the collective
brain before we go on to the next video
from the 1940s Lee says back then I
don't think movie stars would have been
seen without makeup I agree I definitely
agree and then um um I'm having trouble
separating your names that the weaker
race I guess I know craziness right no
makeup selfie spring you're absolutely
right I need to make to chris Christie
and then um let's see any kitty one jets
and it's an ad they still do it today no
one wakes up looking perfect without
makeup very true yeah your name Nicole
great YouTube channel i think the maid
was there to show status i think so too
i agree but status and also the woman's
of inability to take care of herself you
know like I mean it's crazy and kaylee
says the 60s and 70s were an entirely
different ballgame and KJ says I never
saw women back then without makeup on
ever yes and it's kind of crazy how
things are now terry Lee says I know a
woman now that wakes up before a husband
to put her full face on wow that's crazy
steph says everybody want to be a movie
star back then hence the eccentricity
yes and Marlene says its glamour fluff
and not realistic and Valerie says I
wonder if it was helpful
the normal watching because it
definitely didn't sell me or teach me
anything because I mean what percentage
of the population could relate to that
you know that's a really really good
point so now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go ahead and I'm going to go to
my youtube channel let's see I'm going
to go to my history my youtube channel
because they should all be here in my
history and I'm gonna just hold it up
and see if this is better okay so we're
going to go to the 1940s next this one's
really good it's ten minutes long so we
might um let's see if I go like this and
we'll see if this is better ok this is
this is totally an experimental chat
right now because I've never done
anything like this before so thank you
for your patience I'd be surprised if
anybody hangs out that's watching this
on the replay but if you are thank you
so much ok so right here see if i can
turn mix the volumes turn all the way up
thankfully an exercising taste have
enough to be over the way you know into
the outside it's perfectly about you
made a campaign job of removing makeup
huh his hair grow back out of the way
and if you wish cover it with a hand
towel thought you want for the cold
cream ok so you notice that this woman
the big change is she's not wearing any
makeup she's actually not wearing makeup
and this seems like an actually helpful
tutorial which is kind of interesting
all right I'm gonna pull this down for a
second and just check in with the chat
and see if
guys like this format better keep it
clean okay it seems like everybody's
liking this a lot better I think I'm now
I'm going to put in my microphone I was
scared before to plug in the microphone
because I was scared it was going to um
I was scared that it was going to uh to
jam up and not be able to hear anything
if i plugged in my microphone so
hopefully you'll be able to hear me
better now and hear this better now I've
got the volume all the way up on my
phone and hopefully it's a little better
now move closer okay and let's try again
okay so everyone saying it's a little
hard to hear better but muffled okay so
okay let me hopefully this will be
better um Tabitha says yeah she's not
wearing makeup but she's not a famous
actress with an image to maintain very
good point okay so let me go ahead and
flip back over to my screen so I can see
myself and let's talk some more here we
go extra attention to the pocket for the
bait for the nose and the cost of the
chin for the Queen mom using little
spiral motion Oh working so spiral
motion is working up or do you do that
yeah there's talking about not pulling
you're pushing your face around we still
talk about that it's kind of reminds me
of my solar water in the way that we use
not my slow water um like it's kind of
what is kind of like my solar water but
we know we use the pads so this is
apparently a pond commercial now's first
sponsored videos right here we notice
the ponds cold cream and now the ponds
tissues this girl doesn't look happy
which they get breaking their college
killer company one closed period is
devoted to teaching them how to wash
their faces really oh so apparently
there used to be college courses that
taught you how to wash your face if you
were a woman I wonder who matter how to
take a college course to find out what
how to wash their face
seriously doubt it but how funny is that
isn't that funny all right drop him oh
you think Queen she is rub it there's
more times check Finch office but nice
which is homogenized and plenty of
lanolin so lanolin is the ingredient
that's in that bite beauty um the bite
beauty agave lip mask that I use all the
time lanolin is a sheep's wool product
it's the excretion that comes out of the
sheets body to soften the wool to you
know to make it it's like oily stuff
it's goopy stuff that comes out of the
sheepskin so if you're allergic to wool
and you put that all over your face oh
my gosh that poor girl she's gonna be a
hot mess all right I think she's moving
on something different now makeup comes
after cleansing all right so let's take
a second and talk about skin care and
what we think about the skin care there
I was trying to move it in and out
because I wanted to try to make it so
that stayed in focus so i apologize it
was shaking in and out a bit okay so I'm
going to go ahead and scroll up a little
bit to read some of the things in the
collective brain um let's say okay so
everybody seems to like the sound better
okay mari says watch mommy dearest with
eat with the commentary John Waters is
obsessed with eyebrows everything old is
new again Leslie says Diana says yes
circular motions I've always done it
that way let's say fizzy pop says OMG my
mom still uses ponds cold cream sometime
I want to use it I want to use ponds
cold cream and see what I see what it's
like I've never you
that yeah the college credit is just
cracking me up everybody's freaking out
about the college credit and then kg
says her mom still uses pawns to and let
me say Adrian Adrian I think is what
says Jen maybe tilt the phone slightly
to get rid of the glare it might help i
will i'm going to try to figure that out
and enforce case maybe I can move my
lighting over a little bit to make it
better tablet says college was just to
meet a man and marry um nicole says OMG
i'd have a doctorate if i could get a
makeup and skincare college credit he
and fizzy pop says maybe they washed
these in health classes i remember
watching some cheesy videos in school
yeah maybe they did maybe they did but
there was no like it might have been
like a reel-to-reel maybe that they
watched I don't know Shana says my
grandmother still uses cold cream and
Charm School yes absolutely she was
rubbing her face hard wasn't she
absolutely you see if there's anything
else Emma says hashtag actually
sponsored and Kelly says well you have
to remember that women were rarely
allowed to go to college that's very
true that's very true um let me see
there's anything else okay and Marlene
says Noxzema has been ruined they took
out all of the active ingredients okay
yeah I don't know anything about that
alright so let's go ahead and go into
what she said this is 1948 let's see
what she says about makeup application
and I'm gonna see if I can do something
about the glare so let's try we're gonna
this is this is a work in progress here
okay retain the sauce and see if it
adjusts now that's even worse I think
I'd seen a horse
okay so I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna
hold it up like that actually you know
what I can do let me take my phone case
off maybe that helps 1029 already and
we've only watched two videos i wanted
to watch all the way up to the 60s but
the other ones are shorter though this
one's definitely one i want you to see
because this one's really good the
makeup and the hair oh my gosh the hair
you gotta wait till you see the hair
this is like my favorite one that when
we're watching right now so if we don't
get the other ones not that big of a
deal but you can go to the channel link
below like I don't even know this person
and so you know here we go let's try
that where's my ring light let's see if
I could turn the ringling walls now okay
let's see there we go that's better here
we go it's still glary but I think it's
better okay so let's try this vanishing
cream never heard of that so were they
sleeping with the makeup on tri-dot
system I know its glory I want to try
that nothing dates you as much as Rouge
that shows so you shouldn't even be able
to see that it's there so what was the
point
there we go watch this one like my
grandmother I've seen her apply lipstick
like this where you brush upward when
you love the place in with a color of
your skin no writer that's on the side
yes avoid the tooth powder look that's
very important yeah no neck face alright
so there's a makeup tutorial part I
thought was kind of interesting i love
the part about the Rouge and having it
have you can't even see it so much like
you put on just the dot a dot and a dot
and then blend it in so you can't even
see it so what was the point of it thank
you went crazy so I thought that was
kind of interesting um and then with the
lipstick she did apply him in a very
interesting way I've never seen anybody
apply it like that except for my grandma
because it was saying I'm not sure if I
was talking over it that the grain of
the lips goes this way so you want to
apply it this way into the grain of the
lips I guess I don't know maybe our
lipsticks now or a little bit less dry
so maybe we don't you do that anymore
but I thought that was kind of
interesting
to do that ELISA as imagine all the
baking you can do not to get to have all
over your clothes oh I know that powder
was crazy that she was using it was like
all over the place I'm gonna go ahead
and scroll up a little bit and see if
there were any great comments while that
was playing didn't that girl look a
little young to be wearing such a bright
lipstick too she look like she was like
15 she looked super young uh let's see
we scroll down a little bit okay um
spring wants to know by college that
they meet cosmetology school I don't
think so I think they meant college like
if you're a woman going to college you
need to know this stuff like life skills
like how to put on makeup and how to
fold a napkin like I think it was a
class for women specifically to learn
women things crazy right uh let's see
and then Becky says but she put she put
but she put is on she rubbed off the
excess I wonder if that would work yeah
I don't know I don't know it's kind of
interesting Christmas is I feel like I'm
at school LOL and growling cheetah says
if only life were that easy is watching
our face to pass school I know right uh
let's see okay Marley says powder and
lipstick and you're done I know if it
were that easy you know there was no
like contouring and you know she didn't
do her brows she didn't do her eyeliner
she didn't do I shadow like I know
eyeshadow takes the longest for me like
doing my eyeshadow it's crazy how long
eyeshadow can take him mascara like it
wasn't any of that haley said she
couldn't hear it oh no I'm Holly says
her hair was lovely it was lovely
Somerset's can you imagine straighten
your hair with a clothes iron no I can't
that sounds horrible jen says remember
1948 was right after World War Two so
life was very different from a now
that's true and that's exactly what
we're talking about
Sasha said finally made it I'm so glad
you're here in good morning to Julie
fizzy pop says they didn't sleep with
makeup on but you were supposed to wait
until your husband was asleep and then
go wash it off oh yeah just some
craziness um Holly says like she has ear
buds in and can't hear can't can't hear
gem but the video is not considered I'm
sorry we probably won't do this again we
probably won't do this again this will
probably the only time we do this
because just technically it's not
working it was a nice idea but it wasn't
working well it will finish off the chat
but we won't we won't do this again
because it's just not working um Nicole
sets OMG Steve's grandmother put on
lipstick just like that and did in the
ticket Ashley says can't really
understand what she's saying sorry guys
it was a nice thought but you know
Christmas says she's baking night
tabitha says no one noticed she's
wearing a makeup bib I know she is isn't
she well that's because of all that
powder and fallout that was going on her
face um let's see you know talking about
fallout okay alright so this is what
we're gonna do okay so now we're going
to go into the 1950s these are very
short these ones right here they're
super sure this is only one minute long
1955 lipstick this is really an
interesting one you got to see this one
ok hold on a second you get it loaded up
oh man I gotta find it here this it's
only a minute a minute and 20 seconds
long
and that of course means handle bishops
new longer lasting lipstick the only
lipstick I promise be on beautifully all
around the clock here thank you sure you
the convincing kissed you can make
yourself check this out make a mark on
your palm like that than any other brand
perhaps when you're using now and make a
mark right across now Oh early and then
rub across just as hard design now your
handle bishop lipstick little right or
the other practically disappeared now
girl when he and Alicia lipstick and
said just like that on your hand you can
imagine how seamlessly switch blushes
color stays on your lips yes no one
today he believed in sight far after
lasting lipstick and it should be so you
should have been able to hear that one
now it was pretty loud so hopefully you
were able to hear that when I thought
that was kind of interesting because you
know to put a big smush of lipstick on
your hand like that I wonder like that
I'm sure that would still work you know
like if we wanted to do that now like
that would totally work right like we
could totally do that and you know I
mean but what happened to hazel bishop
what happened what happened to that
lipstick oh my goodness i don't even
know i'm gonna scroll up a little bit
but that would not an interesting test I
want to try that with some of my
lipsticks that could claim to be long
wearing and see what happens right I'm
gonna look at me a collective brain of
makeup awesomeness and see what people
are saying um Tara be says that she went
to a women's college and yes they used
to have classes like that oh my goodness
um terry Lee says my grandmother used
air spun first time I opened my
containers instantly transported to her
room Wow
okay so let's go ahead and let me scroll
down okay I'm trying to find where we
were okay we're getting to the 60s the
60s is going to be next um Julie says
when my mom went to college in the 50s
she couldn't wear pants and they had to
present themselves in the best way every
day they had to do makeup for going to
class um Lee says I like the way they
use tissues instead of brushes kind of
interesting um let's see if anybody's
talking about the lipstick okay okay via
via loca says Jen you did a great job
everything was fine i really didn't need
to hear every word just seeing this old
videos was fun they're um they're old
it's it's gonna not going to be HD
that's true and it is hard to hear them
but again if you want to watch them
again the links down below so Lee says
hazel bishop I remember that yeah I'm
old steph says I'm not wasting my
expensive lipstick on my hand dismissed
TMI Flo says this reminds me of my
grandma um let's see okay hold on a
minute okay there we go uh Marlene says
I remember it to Christmas says the
first liquid lipstick it didn't look to
be a liquid lipstick but it was the only
a long-wearing lipstick and Tanya says a
wonderful bishop changed names I'll have
to do some research and find out TMI
fliss's she taught me how to bake over
20 years ago and at least that's where
did that brand go in Somerset stays on
your lips and not on your man ladies but
and Lee's excited about azle bishop this
one was way better sound wise i think
it's just the qualities of quality the
videos are just getting better um
they're at ephesus very bad bet I love
old commercials let's see do a lipstick
test live I don't really have any
lipstick right now that I plan to do
that with and probably take me forever
and you guys don't want to wait for that
Becky says wear red shades the only ones
available back in the day it seems to be
wait till you see the next one from the
1960s and you're going to laugh it's
going to address that exact issue Diana
says I wonder if you reversed it and did
that hazel opposite of the way showed if
you can get the same results you mean
like if the cross may
difference which way you put it yeah I
don't know it's kind of interesting all
right and then Lisa did I see hazel
Bishop face cream the other day oh I
don't know and I'm glowing growling
cheetah says she's really liking this
okay so Miranda Oh mr. mrs. Ramirez's
hazel Bishop is sold on ebay so cool
okay cool nice okay Vicki says hazel
lost the company and stock take over
okay so what we're going to do now is
now we're going to go into the 1950s and
we're going to watch a cote commercial
oh no that's 1960s one where's that oh
yeah 1960s coty commercial this is um
there's an ad for a nap all right okay
let me flip back over you guys are going
to laugh at this this one's really good
this is only on one minute long so this
one's a nice short one country hip
stickers match each perfect Padma a lot
of a lovely new distribution choose your
Katie lipstick color from Japan Danya
forests are grouping red ribbon fresh
pink shpongle fuchsia be room set like
what kirti lipstick stays on longer and
extra
ask for beauty and fashion matched
lipstick in the heaven Rider candy
striped case met awesome it's like
here's this shade of red and then this
shade of red and the shade of red and
this a ride and they didn't look
that would you different like the only
one I could really tell a difference was
one that was like something gold like it
had a little bit of a gold shimmer to it
for the whole look was like what one
night oh my goodness it was so funny is
like and read and read and read and read
and read and read and read like what are
you kidding me sighs thought that was
really really funny so yes yes yes I
thought that one was was great so I had
to show that one to you because that one
really made me laugh um I'm just
clicking through my my things that I had
done up here for our chat and that we're
not using but but yeah so uh Holly says
check out the beginning of the
psychedelic era oh I know I didn't load
anything for their I have a couple more
1960s that are coming up this one here
let me see what this one is 1950s oh
that's a hazel bishop so I have a couple
1961 s loaded up and then that's all I
had loaded up was to more 1960s ones
Marlene says brightly red lips were in
New didn't come until the 60s yes and if
you think about it was it Brigitte
Bardot was she was the one that was
nineteen sixties I'm trying to think cuz
you know I wasn't alive then I know I
hate that I'm not trying to make anybody
feel old but you like i'm not sure like
which actress was when as far as like
the 50 60 70 s um but i might sound like
an idiot because I said Brigitte Bardot
but if you think about it you know when
you look at like the old TV shows from
1960s when you started seeing Twiggy
there you go we started seeing those
nude lips coming in yeah absolutely
absolutely thick eyeliner with white
Elizabeth Taylor yes everybody's like
Twiggy Twiggy Twiggy Twiggy yes
absolutely and I just thought that was
funny with all the red and one thing in
the other one where they were saying
about making sure your lipstick matched
your nail polish and
at your blush I thought that was kind of
interesting and you saw her for a second
like pretending to paint her nails so
yeah I thought that was kind of
interesting all right we've got 15
minutes left let's get into another one
okay so we got the Cote okay this is a
Maybelline ad and this one's actually
really interesting I really like this
one a lot it's a 1960s I makeup by
Maybelline Bardot was 60s fairly
positive cool Gina says LOL you are a
baby but HP had had a line then my mom
always used it your lipstick always
stays on you not him thanks for the
memory all good i'm so glad unblended
eyeshadow Adrian says I don't know how
people find these commercials but this
is a great channel like I just
discovered it yesterday I don't like
super excite us this says 1965 I'm gonna
go ahead and flip it over and it's a
Maybelline add check it out there are no
words the important thing you say with
your eyes make sure your eyes are
beautiful make sure with me the I make
of the rings on it and loveliness with
Maybelline even eyes like peas instead
of that easily become masses I important
things are said with your eyes
maybelline makes even a lawyer and I say
that again watch your Express and which
is not wearing makeup for wrong with the
contour brush that softly shapes
expressing rounds respectively you saw
color with rush on my Maybelline your
eyeshadow is never that pigmented
not with your eyes kinda pressure looks
so the two things that I knew things
that I noticed like her lashes there's
no way those things were were um there
is no way that those lashes were actual
real lashes they looked like they were
just pressed on extra hairs I mean
there's there's just no way that that
was done with a mascara that was so
incredibly fake and like when she's not
wearing the makeup she's all like and
then she was makeup on and she's like
just so money um so says oh my man's
face is on fire of my lashes are
beautiful Marlene said color TV wasn't
out yet in the 1960s right where's that
70s right is one color TV started coming
out 1970s um Becca says come on
Maybelline your eyeshadow yeah as I said
they totally look like fake lashes um
Holly says my grandma's eyebrows were
like that yeah just total instagram
browse definitely definitely Instagram
browse tab that says it was a trend for
models to not show teeth while smiling
during the early 60s to about nine about
1967 she is beautiful isn't she KJ um
free to be uh free to be me Barbie holy
cow i made it unbelievable i'm so happy
you're here yeah there's no way those
lashes were real jenna says I by
Maybelline eye shadow if it was that
pigmented now I mean cuz like who knows
what that what color that actually was
in the sepia tone you know who knows
Sarah says I'm listening but not
watching this morning with my ear buds
while at work can't wait to see these
videos when i get home and history of
makeup is fascinating I think so too
that's why I do so many of these with
the history of makeup deepest says my
expression was priceless thank you yeah
falsies frosties were big back then KJ I
didn't know that color TV 1967 but I
would imagine like most houses didn't
get it right away like it took a little
while so maybe the early 70s it was more
popular alright so we've got ten minutes
left and then let me see what I have
left as far as the ones that i've loaded
up
yeah oh these bees died on me okay on a
second oh this one this one's with that
this is nine minutes long it's a really
long one but it's really good I think
this is the last one but it's really
really good I think it's totally worth
it to let go into this and talk about it
it says vintage makeup tutorial in 1969
okay let me flip over to the screen so I
can see all right here we go there she
is isn't she pretty all right he noticed
no women of color man no way no women of
color that she said when i'ma let me
rewind that for a second and not talk
through it what I meant so she's
laughing at her over that makeup and
like think about how many people on
YouTube you seen with a look similar to
this we pause it when it when it gets
there so you can see go easy look at
this how many makeup tutorials have you
seen where the girl looks like this as
far as how much makeup she's wearing
like really and truly maybe the blush is
a little overdone but it's really not
that far off from today's some of
today's makeup looks all right she's
laughing at herself
it's not interesting do you do that do
you move it from the Ephraim essential
to the outside I know I don't think
about it your color choice what's up
with the dog there you go color
correcting I like how they call it
disturbed skin so this is the first use
of concealer we've seen two or three
tones that's a lot she didn't Splenda
very much either I feel like we still do
that you know we pause it for a second
that we we do still go from the center
of the eye back for blush like that's
something we still do which i think is
kind of interesting I mean it makes
sense with the face shape right all
right don't do that into the temples
contouring would but she's using blush
the contour and is he her going downward
almost like skeleton like she went to
contour like this and straight down
reminds me of like Skeletor like this
can you imagine a woman trying to do
that and then ending up a blush like
down here how weird man
when's your makeup the simplest powder
to use is a calmness translucent one pat
on liberally attacked of company can be
thrown away it's not interesting wait
for the powder to set brush away excess
with downward strokes I brand scream VI
and focus interest on so important in
the shaping of the nose eyebrows and the
shaping of the nose so instead of an
eyebrow gel Vaseline feel like we still
do that do that but we do pluck above we
do above I can't imagine using a
black pencil I guess p.m. really black
feel like we still do this you still do
all of this lease in my opinion that's
what I do
so this is like an actual helpful one
periscope sex with Avenue his life
mascara applied to lashes so you hear
that I'm talking too much she said that
sufficient makeup for someone in the
earth their early teens is just that
much which makes sense i mean i can see
that i can see that supplying with her
fingers there you never wear bright
obvious evening colors never oh don't do
that and then there's the dog what's up
the doll like why is there a dog what
does that have to do with anything i
guess to give you like that homey feel I
don't know there's a dog what dog so
when he's just watching her like there
you go there's your transition color by
concentrating the shadow knows
that's what we do right all the time and
sometimes on both sides right I might do
that highlighting that brow bone it's
amazing how much is similar right this
eyeliner and that interesting no hard
obviously you see that black can old
black eyeliner can only be worn by women
with very black hair and you know we go
against that now that is not even close
to what we do now there we go so she
sang these brown the blondes and
brunettes in mascara I weapon fashion
daintily putting on that mascara each
for wearing lipstick is about 14 and
then the same color is the most becoming
so here comes the subtle color stick
that's not a subtle color interesting
right do you apply your lipstick like
that I know I don't I just slap it on
from that too
not the excess softer smoother look
apply lip gloss remember lips need
protection as well as the skin if you
prefer not to wear lipstick do there you
go so you need to wear one of the other
girlfriend now is shoot lip contouring
watch this only toward the inside of the
lips I guess you didn't want tech lips
skin punctures could not be entirely
avoided by those young girls so she's
saying that if you if you have blemishes
is probably due to an unhealthy diet and
not being clean and we know that that's
not true right but that's what they
thought that's what they thought it
makes matters worse just so you know
dogs like yes you look so pretty alright
so that was that was the last one we're
going to do for today but there's tons
more down on that um in that website
about not on that youtube channel so all
right so anyway I just think that's so
interesting KJ says no way over painting
don't do it you know girlfriend that
people are doing that now you know they
were doing it now Marlene says I break
out more when I eat a lot of crap you
know I think that so for some people it
can make a difference but there's some
people that are going to get there's a
lot of stereotypes out there that if you
don't if you have blemishes or whatever
that you're an unclean person that
you're not washing your face properly
and we know that that's not true so I do
think that it can in
packed your skin but I know that that's
not the only thing that impacts your
skin is diet and cleanliness so I just
feel like that's like really really
judgey you know so you didn't see the
dog oh my gosh totally missed it
definitely watch the video again down
below if you didn't miss the dogs dogs
pretty funny so talk starts can't even
say that on this channel not allowed so
I'm gonna go ahead and i'm gonna scroll
up just a little bit because we're out
of time but i want to scroll up just a
little bit and read some of the comments
from the collective brain um sarah says
I just watch this my 12 year old
daughter it was fun I'm so glad you
enjoyed it Sam the dog is funny yeah
girl like she that drunk growling
cheetah says he's depressed and stuck
there springs this Sam does make him do
he does he does do make up with me fizzy
pop says gurus love to show their dogs
and that is so true maybe this is like
the first time you know women with you
know I gonna make a tutorial you know oh
here's fuzzy say my fuzzy you know like
I don't know um free to be me Barbie
says rin-ten-ten haha um all she needs
is a candle burning in the back alley
says and Tanya says bedroom eyes Christy
says I think all shapes and sizes have a
place you mean for eyes I'm assuming it
we definitely need a candle Angie said
this is fascinating what channel is the
site there's a link down underneath the
video if it's glam glam something what's
it called um glamour daze GL am oh you
are da ze is where I found all of these
and there's more to there's more on
other channels that Katie beauty says my
mother was always horrified at how much
black eyeliner i use she said it was
inappropriate and that's what they're
saying basically sorry you're so funny
oh my goodness blondes owned the 70s
they sure did Holly didn't they Marlene
says I don't use much black it's too
harsh for my light coloring so okay jay
says and coffee growling cheetah says
she's she clearly has a lot of time to
waste because she's slow she is slow
she's very slow um alright so anyway I'm
gonna go ahead and scroll down a bit if
I missed your comment and I missed some
gem that you drop in the chat definitely
wants this video renders go down into
the
on that section below and type it in
there I hope you enjoyed this I know
that it was really weird like getting
started it was a slow start and you know
I just didn't really know what I was
doing with this because again this is
something I couldn't test that ahead of
time so i can only test it when it's
live so you know um yeah that was it was
it was fun I had fun and then hopefully
YouTube their technology will get a
little better as far as this because
there is a YouTube button that I can use
but the problem with that is that you
can't hear me you'll only be able to
hear the video and you guys can watch
the video on your own I think without
the commentary it's like what's the
point of watching it together you know
without the commentary so I want to
thank you so much for joining me today
that was a lot of fun we'll have the
same chat again next week 10 a.m.
eastern time leave your suggestions for
chat topics down below remember it does
have to be an hour-long topic so it's
got to be something we can talk about
for a very long time things that you're
interested in talking about and chatting
about and and you know the best part
about this is having the collective
brain because it's not just my opinion
it's the opinion of 100 other people in
there and and you know it's that's I
think the way that we're really going to
grow as makeup artists on ourselves and
the way we are going to save ourselves
money and things like that is by working
together as a community to make sure
we're educating each other on what works
and what doesn't work so we can save
money you know is what it comes down to
so I want to thank you again so much for
watching and definitely if you're not
already subscribed which I don't be I'd
be surprised if you're not are
subscribed and you're still here but if
you're not already subscribed you
definitely subscribe to the channel so
you don't miss what's going to make up
in the chat next week so I want to thank
you again so much for being here and
