anything about the cooling feature of my
computer fan so I'm really really sorry
about that I don't know I'm gonna have
to figure out some other system just
bear with me for this one I apologize
okay so it looks like we're good okay
so let's go ahead into the topic because
you guys have waited long enough without
oh my gosh okay topic we're talking
about anti Hall today
if you haven't seen her from the Clarke
kimberly-clark had a really fun YouTube
channel and she does anti halls all the
time where she talks about I think she's
not going to buy and there's so much
stuff out there to buy it's like there's
there's no way you could buy it all
you just can't so we have to decide some
things that we're not going to buy so
what I decided to do was I went on my
phone and I screen captured a ton of
pictures of things that I wanted to talk
to you guys about so that we can so we
can talk about things that you guys
would want to buy things I want to buy
things that are like popular right now
that I know a lot of people are buying
but maybe we don't want a bucket maybe
we're like no we're not gonna buy it
she'll like for example okay for example
this is one thing I almost bought it
today I almost bought it today on this
if you can see that okay this right here
on my screen is like on a delay so this
is not gonna wear it hold on a second
cuz I can't see myself and now I'm
watching my camera this is like I don't
like this function okay hold on a second
oh you could see it okay
so here we go so check that out that is
eight artists eyeliner set by Tarte it's
a four Islander set it comes with a
brush and four Chartist Islanders now I
love the original black TARDIS eyeliner
I absolutely love it so I was thinking
really hard about getting this but it's
like $40.00 or something crazy like it's
insane and it's like am I ever going to
actually use it am I really going to use
a gold eyeliner and a bronze eyeliner
probably not like I might use a blue
maybe but I probably won't use it so
what in the world is the point yeah oh
my goodness Emmy says I love that you're
crediting people no of course oh my gosh
I
take an idea from someone I'm definitely
credit me I think Kimberly's amazing so
in any way this is something I really
want but I think I'm not going to get it
you know it's yeah exactly beauty bebe
beauty says it was $20 yeah exactly
if they were if they were three for
twenty I guess cuz they look like
they're small - they don't even look
full-sized so I don't think so you have
twenty dollars maybe exactly exactly but
I really like them if they were
full-sized I might get them no I
wouldn't there's a lot of samples are
there's no reason why this should be
there okay another thing ants I hope I'm
not going to get also from tart is this
the new gigantic ginormous palate it's
beautiful it's asking people Nicole says
she'd love usually bronze and gold
eyeliner but then just get dampening the
damn kasha yeah I mean exactly you can
use just an eyeshadow on a on a brush
exactly so this looks gorgeous this
Tarte eyeshadow palette it's got all
those beautiful shade the shade range
looks amazing
it's got the blush it's got a highlight
it's got a bronzer it's got a lip
product it's got a mascara it's got a
brush I mean it just looks amazing I I'm
not getting it ayuh I've been burned by
Tarte eyeshadows so many times where I
just don't like them but I need to
remember when I see these people
packaging but I'm not it's not gonna be
good Corey says she heard the packet the
tile is terrible so there you go there
you go sue said the pallets are pretty
but it's huge
that's another really good point it's
gigantic where am I gonna put this thing
where are we gonna put it there's
nowhere for you I mean place I can put
it obviously but it's like why do I want
to clutter my life with this I'm not
gonna clutter my life Kristen says the
hotel hotel cafe ok-ran hotel cafe this
is the hall part this is the whole part
okay so I was talking to talking about
this because I just got this tab is one
of the moderators in here she's my
production manager for what's the make
up we were chatting last night about
this okay this is the Too Faced grand
who it's all traffic it comes like this
and you open it up and it's the cutest
little thing ever
it is so stinkin cute these pallets are
small which of course we expected
there's a little better than sex mascara
on the bottom these smell bad like
don't just smell not like they're
supposed to they don't smell good they
really don't I went to my husband I said
close your eyes I'll have to smell these
I'm gonna do this to my children I
haven't let them smell them I'm gonna do
this to my children when I do the full
review and I said okay baby smell this
smell this and you let me know what you
think it smells like this is the only
one he got close he said this smelled
like s'mores he said it smelled like
ginger um like our graham crackers and I
can kind of see that but it also has a
makeup smell it smells like nigga to
face it it a really good job I feel like
with the chocolate sense with the peanut
butter scent with the peach scent they
did not do a good job with these at all
so like this this one isn't as bad but
like these these don't smell good at all
they make me sad I don't think they say
Heather says don't they smell coffee or
something big do not smell they smell
like scented makeup it's got a slightly
sweet scent but okay think about this
did you remember like if you when you
were a kid if you went to like the
dollar store and got like like scented
like scratches sniff stickers or are you
a strategist if Snickers Snickers are
better than these like it just smells
really fake and bad like really bad
I don't they smell but I have not even
swatch them yet because I was debating
whether I want to take pictures of them
before smartphone because I'm trying to
work on like trying to take really nice
pictures of things that put things up on
Instagram but I'm cloud just going to
and it's watching them I haven't used
these yet but you're getting them for
the scent don't do it don't even do it
it's not even worth it so I haven't
swatch again so as far as eyeshadow
quality I don't know yet I don't know
but I just got him yesterday took to
face forever to get these to me I
ordered these right when they came out
on the two-faced website they just got
to me yesterday okay the other thing I
got that I haven't showed you guys yet
Nicole says I never do toothpaste
holiday pellets I thought they're never
great just like a packaging hey that's
what happened to me last year with the
Paris one I ended up returning the Paris
one I also got the little let it glow
set
this thing I don't know how much I paid
for this because I ordered it like a
week and a half ago but these are so
tiny there's old timey and it's like
Jared alright I'm gonna talk to you
Jared right now you know Jared's not
watching this I'm a toucher
how much is this product cost you to
make how much does it cost you to make
this little tiny bit of product this is
point zero eight ounces how much does
this cost can you give us twice as much
as this police police
like this is the tiniest little bit of
product ever and then the snow bunny
bronzer I mean I really like these
products but they're so tiny the
packaging is feels ton cheap and it's
just I'm not happy with it and I would
be embarrassed to give this as a gift to
be completely honest especially for a
makeup lover for someone that is just
kind of dabbling and makeup it doesn't
know about chibi packaging then maybe
but I'm not impressed
little tiny this is point zero seven
ounces for the love left blush I mean
it's just I don't know I forgot how much
I pay for this now I have to look it up
because if it was like $15 $20 the most
even $20
I feel like might even be too much I
have to look it up but it's just I don't
know I wish that they just gave twice as
much product is this like even point one
ounces I feel I could be better than
point zero eight just come on a new look
I'm almost there okay so this is let it
glow $25 $25 for these little things no
no it's Cathy therefore I hope so and
then the brush the brush is very soft
it's a very nice little brush I have to
say that 25 bucks that says 25 bucks
exactly exactly just no just no I mean
it just no don't recommend it don't
recommend so if you're gonna put
something on your anti wholeness I would
definitely say put this on your aunt I
call this because it's just I'm
disappointed I'm disappointed in the
size of it
Claudia products is good but I'm
disappointed in the size so
twenty-five dollars alright so let's
talk about some more things there so I'm
missing so much in chat right now and
Church cap production says I paint like
$10 bet I would pay 15 for it I feel
that this is worth 15 definitely but not
25 not at all everybody's talking to God
you in terrific I love you guys all
right let's get back to the ant wall so
let's go back into where I have all my
pictures saved it's like the day of
technical difficulties okay so this is
something though size does matter Kelly
says I agree size does matter okay
Tracie's does get frustrating when
youtubers go on and on about how great
these products are when they receive
them 5gr yeah I'm learning a little more
about that side a little bit more about
that side and you know I don't know if
ever I'm never gonna fit into that world
I don't know Oh Thank You Diana so she's
loving my nail polish I loved my nail
polish collection it makes me happy
every day with me got it
you were probably all like clumpy at
this point but I don't even care because
it makes me pretty and it makes me
pretty makes makes me think happy
thoughts because it simply alright next
thing but this one actually maybe might
be something you might want to get the
little mini tart blushes if these are
anything like the other tart blushes
that I've gotten the little mini ones I
really like the mini tart blushes so if
you've never tried to are luscious this
might actually be something you might
want to look at I mean it's I kind of
like these things I kinda like these
things so you know um you know I and it
comes with a brush too it comes with
this lick fluffy brush did you guys see
that so I don't know I think that might
be one if I didn't own a bunch of tart
blushes I might be interested in getting
that another thing that looked really
interesting I can't even see what that
is my capture didn't turn out so good oh
this is something I've been looking at
but I probably won't get the benefit
those kits the brow kits by benefit to
define and refine brows there's a bunch
of these kits and I've heard wonderful
things about these things so if you're
interested in getting a bunch of brow
products this might
should be something you might be
interested in getting because I've been
really enjoying the I've been really
enjoying the brow products from benefit
the new ones Karen must know how much
for the Tarte blushes and you know what
ice cream captured them from ulties
website so if you go to Alta dot-com you
should be able to see it Megan says they
do not swatch they are total crap the
small chart blushes but see the ones I
got in the holiday set last you were
really good at least for me I really
liked them so I don't know yeah I mean
and the truck flushes someone else made
a comment and they disappeared really
really fast I'm ready to go out I can go
back
okay Nicole says I feel like tart
blushes never swatch well but look great
on the cheeks with a brush and Nicole I
think you have a really good point there
I I completely agree with you with that
totally agree totally agree so Brenda
says this isn't an anti haul it is no it
is I've got some good stuff and some not
so good stuff so I'm Cheyenne says the
tart wheel is good is it really
oh that's good to know Cheyenne nice and
then Mawson says hi Jen I don't catch
your life chats often but I'm glad you
I'm bottom here T I'm glad you're here
today too
Leah says I want to be the tart blushes
from my daughter for Christmas I think
that would be nice you gotta be nice and
Tiffany says she agrees them to pull it
off the chart okay um alright so let's
go to the next thing
anti call answer huh okay here we go
anti vault right here you want some anti
hall here's some anti hall for you the
new urban decay lip palette okay new
urban decay lip palette so not getting
it there's nothing in my mind and in my
heart that makes me want to get this
thing know and I could tell you why I
don't like lip palettes
that's me personally I want to put a
lipstick in my pocket or in my purse and
I want to pull it out and oh come on
lipstick on and I'll put it back on a
pocket on my purse I don't feel the need
personally for me and my needs to carry
around the entire lip palette I've no
interest in them no interest in that and
if I'm home like if and I want my
lipsticks to stay on all day I want to
be able to take that lipstick I put on
home and keep it with me all day I'm not
a lip palate person one thing I'm very
thankful for though is that they didn't
include any eyeshadow products
but it's all lip because I hate it when
they mix the shadows the powder stuff
with a creamy stuff and then the powder
gets in the cream and it's nasty and
gets junky and it messes with the color
and it's dusting so I'm glad they didn't
do that but at the same time I am NOT in
the lip palate and I don't know like I'm
sure there's gotta be people that love
the the lip palettes because people come
out with them so there must be somebody
buying I'm right I must I must not be I
must be you know different than some
people you know so I don't know and yeah
the price is insane Stephanie says too
expensive trusting luck
you already had these clothes oh I know
right and Cassie says I can't say I know
anyone who likes lip pallets not even
lip addicts like me I know they're so
inconvenient so inconvenient another one
which is an anti thing for me I'm not
get makeup artist there you go Nancy
says makeup arts exactly yes I feel it
would be great for a makeup artist
absolutely but mm-hmm-hmm and all things
Irene said I'm completely anti lip
palate I'm with you I'm with you
girlfriend I'm with you for makeup
artist there you go see that would be
smart
but may not even make up artist newsroom
now this is one that I know a lot of
people are really really interested in
and I think I'm probably gonna pass on
it at least for now
and that is the new Urban Decay Naked
basics ultimate basic palette it's just
not calling to me it's not telling me
come by it's not saying yet meet by me
like I just there's something about it
maybe it's the the five neutrals up
on the top they're just boring me to
death like these leaves up here it looks
so incredibly boring I don't know like
yeah amanda says I'm so over the naked
thing I'm sure were the naked thing too
like I think they're they've played it
out I think it's done you know moving on
moving on oh and then Poggi trek oh oh I
know your name I know your real name and
I can't it's misfiled in my breathe and
I know you'll need but she said she got
the lorac three Lori and I did get the
lorac mega pro 3 because I have the one
in the two so I had to get the three I
wanted to add it to my collection
so I did get the Meg approached me I
broke down I broke down but so it's
anyway Amanda Thank You Amanda
it was in my brain it was misfiled it
was misfiled so yeah I mean I didn't see
why some people might want this
but with my current makeup needs I don't
think I'm gonna get it and I have so
much stuff that I want to review right
now I think I'm gonna let it go let it
go
yes lorac mega Pro free is available at
Ulta com4 free sale for like the for the
butch kollek's the the membership the
highest membership the the whatever the
highest membership at all it says
platinum members goodness gracious this
angle is not making me happy want us to
move that down the bed okay I don't like
you guys see it's ugly so that's
something I don't think platinum thank
you guys so much for telling me that
Valerie says Jen the ultimate bakes this
is a dupe for the Stila eyes are the
window neutral one is it really
interesting wow wow wow oh my goodness
divorce says when you break down fresh
program you get a better value of a
hundred times better quality with the
busy dark matte palette
she said it she said it okay there's
another one this I bought but this is
probably gonna upload back to the store
after with us because I don't like that
this one I hear oh I got something bad
off so I got like a harem eyeball okay
this it is not good it is not good at
all okay I got it out we're good and
then I'm gonna stick my fingers in my
product get your stuff together again
okay I don't know if you can see that
but it's super super super glittery like
it's straight weather does this this is
not a good product in my opinion and the
packaging is so bulky you can takes us
back to the bookies so bulky absolutely
amanda says to glitter glittery for me
like fairy farts this is the biggest
fairy fart palette I've ever seen it is
straight straight glitter and to the
point where there is such little
pigmentation in the product you might as
well just had one shade I mean it's just
there's no there's nothing the brush is
not bad
Marilyn Mary
marylee my friend American she just felt
differently um the brush is not bad I've
used the brush it's not bad but the
product inside is so not even worth it
and I'm gonna do that for highlighter
review of this one and the Laura Mercier
one this one this one's nice
this one's really nice the warmer today
when I'm wearing that one today and then
the Stila one which I don't know I guess
there's a that's the bathroom you off
for one one and Instagram says that she
wasn't interested and then this is the
seal of one I hold these last week for
you guys it's not last week or the week
before for you guys that so I'm going to
do a comparison with you or three of
these probably next week but yeah hmm
glitter migrates everywhere boom you're
starting in Twilight four he says that's
that's what I'm trying to say I wish I'd
come up with that joke but you're
absolutely right you're absolutely right
totally with you totally with you um
Margaret says I got the pure cream
highlighter palette and you love it mmm
that's interesting
good to know British is waiting for a
sweet palates nice Amy loves busy art
yeah I need more busy art in my life
more busy art mega Pro three Rose Marie
is out for Ulta Platinum members all
right let me move it home okay
next thing this probably is something
I'm not going to get the moondust cream
eyeshadows by Urban Decay I haven't
decided yet
it's one of those I'm kind of on the
fence because cream eyeshadow products
are just not my favorite in general so
I'm not even sure Valerie says Jen kind
of rocked off topic but what do you
think of who survived stuff to review
them return them I kind of feel wrong
about it I feel like this is a little
bit off topic but I'll address it very
quickly I don't think you should
purchase something to review it just so
you can return it but I don't see any
problem with buying something and then
thinking it sucks and then returning it
I think that kind of when you know I
mean I just think it's time I stuff to
like waste product like that you know I
don't know but this companies makes so
much money I don't know I'm not I'm not
gonna be judgy and say that I think
they're bad people for doing it I could
just say that me
I choose not to do that everything i buy
i buy with the intention of keeping but
I definitely return things if I don't
like I will not shoot things because you
know I need to buy more stuff so you
know um but yeah I haven't tried this
product yet someone just said does it
crease I don't know kate says it's
highly unethical I think just wasteful
and I kind of I feel like that too but
I'm not going to judge if people want to
do that I'm not going to say I think
they're a terrible person but it's not
mine it's not something I would do so
Tracy says what do they do with the
stuff you will return I'm pretty sure my
friend all just said they just um they
give they throw it away I think I think
they just throw it away
so Amalia says I'm a teacher - how your
year going I'm not teaching anymore I
quit that place this is what I do full
times I hang out with you people best
job I ever had but you know I'm still
teacher of my heart still teacher my
heart one thing that I was thinking
about maybe getting but I probably won't
is the bucks um I think this was buxom
who should be Swiss bucks in massage
shadow college year but I don't think
I'm gonna get it because I don't think
anybody care and when you put the care
can't beliefs if people dumpster dive
for that stuff I've heard that I've
heard of that yeah hmm
hygiene recent me gets thrown away yep
George Pataki says that yep I agree I
agree yeah it does look unique but I
don't know you pancake says it looks
unique I don't know I do love buxom
eyeshadows Becca I'm totally with you I
love bought some eyeshadows I love the
ones that I have but I don't think I'm
gonna get this one I don't think so
Mickey wants to know when the funfetti
is coming out I have no idea I don't
know I don't think he said it yet when
did we set it yet oh this is one I was
having trouble not getting the new Tarte
highlighter I think that looks really
cool I don't know why Tarte hasn't
jumped on like that this thing that
highlighters like this but it looks it
looks awesome so I don't know yeah
pancake says I have too many eyeshadows
only of two eyes I know right I know
right hey summer moon dust pan shadows
are not the same as the new clean ones
yeah that's what I've heard I've heard
that they're very different
I've heard the same thing Joan go out
and come back
she's having trouble seeing me okay the
other thing I'm having trouble not
getting here's another thing I'm having
trouble not getting the it cosmetics
genesect wah blush palette so much
trouble
Martita says get the blush pops in
tartan has two highlighters oh well
there you go Mimi says Jen I love your
reviews what's your second impression of
G vyas place dubious place face brushes
are great as creating the palettes I
don't I don't know honestly I just used
the genius place at one time I haven't
used it since then so I don't know to be
completely honest I'll tell you when I
try it more I will definitely you guys
know I wanted to full review on it but
again I leave two eyes so today I'd like
for testing today I focused on using
this this Sephora favorites extravagant
eyes I wanted to wear this by itself and
I'm testing out the I like the lower of
my eyeliner a little bit and I'm trying
the heavy metal here and I tried the
mascara so I'm trying to cook I can look
over some one thing at a time
unfortunately so that was my focus today
I've tried some of the other products so
I'd wanted to really focus on those
today this is a really great kid this is
a really great kit if you want
extravagant eyes this is not a going to
work kind of thing this is like I want
to bowl crazy eyes people with deeper
skin tones how we will be able to get
away with this much better on a daily
than people with lighter skin tones
because it's still looking really really
bold unless that's your thing to be
really really bold and definitely get it
but I think for the typical person
they're not gonna want a look as bold as
this but if it should be exactly go for
it do you think okay back to the Genesee
kua I've been I've totally lost track it
looks so pretty I want to put my fingers
in it this bronzer though what's really
Orange so that makes me nervous and that
kind of pushed me on the way of no
probably not
church map reduction says that kit was
sold out to support today were so bummed
I think it's available online if you
want to Caroline says there is actually
videos on YouTube that people dump
through diving for products accidentally
stumbled upon one and just shocked I
could not do that I could not take
makeup out of the dumpster and use it
like that would just gross me out every
time I looked at it I would have been
like
I took this out of a dumpster like I
couldn't I couldn't do it I could not do
it
so that would that genesect my palate
not calling the name another thing
that's kind of calling my name is this
Laura Geller Bates thing you got what's
amazing yeah pinkeye exactly Amanda
pinkeye but most big thing looks good I
really like more Gellar baked products
but I'm gonna pass on it because at this
point when I'm buying things I'm buying
things for review but I don't think a
mass amount of people are gonna be
interested in it there we go Caroline
says I totally don't judge do you girl I
couldn't no I could not dumpster dive
though there's no way summer says I'm
still waiting for my makeup geek ordered
I always buy those shadows yeah I need
more makeup geek stuff cuz I haven't
bought makeup even forever where it says
next to the rotten vegetables hopefully
the old dumpster doesn't share with the
restaurant
now have you more evolved dreama says
Jenn that's Sephora tart radiance ritual
travel set is $32 zero the chart I later
in it we do something like that I do
like the sephora favorites kit kids I
think they're amazing pancake says she's
waiting for my son Sephora favorites
blow kit that was the one that was sent
to me the most was the glow kid but I
had to let it go I had to let it go I
got this one this is the one I'm gonna
review and I need to let the other ones
go I need to stop myself because you can
only I can only try and review so much
makeup you know
yeah the sephora favorites face kit yes
I can okay so the face kit you talked
about the glow one this one is the one
I'm hoping they're talking about the
glow kit looks amazing I actually
screen-capture the ingredient like what
comes in it so we could talk about it
without me having to search I just have
to find which one guys here it is okay
so it comes with the they're also deluxe
sample size it looks like but I'm not
100% sure it says it comes with the
Becca shimmering skin perfecter liquid
and moonstone which sounds amazing the
Becca cost the oh the benefit cosmetic
Watts up cream to powder highlighter in
champagne
the cover FX custom infusion drops c+
lemongrass gradients that actually
sounds very interesting the hourglass
ambient strobe lighting powder and
incandescent strobe light that sounds
really interesting to me the Lancome
glow Satya silky cream a highlighter and
glowing lights that sounded interesting
and the milk makeup sunshine oil I don't
know what that is it kind of freaks me
out a little bit but I would definitely
be willing to try it see that one sounds
really good summer says I'm so bummed
sephora favorites mascara kit all but
two mascaras I dislike they need to stop
pushing the NARS audacious oh my gosh I
know summer I saw the NARS audacious in
that thing and I was like why why I've
never met anybody that lets that mascara
if you like that mustard you have to
leave it in the comments below and tell
me why in the world you like it like
tell me about your lashes tell me about
you because I do not get it at all let
me see if I can find that kit that I
have it one here's the new lash - I
don't know if you can see it but it's
right there there's the new lash - you
pancake says it's just an oil it's just
the corneal really that's it so there
you go
oh oh glitzy Fritzie bye go enjoy your
pizza I hope you enjoy your pizza okay
let me look and see what's in this thing
the NARS audacious mascara is one of the
worst mascaras at every slide in my
entire life like the worst then I would
rather buy the great lab maybelline
great lash the big neon pink and green
one I'd rather get that than the NARS
audacious I think it performs better
like any dollar ninety-nine two dollar
mascara runs better than outside world
know what they were thinking okay here
we go so copies would it be benefit
they're real comes with the Bobbi Brown
smoky eye the benefit they reveal I like
but it's difficult to get off and drives
me bonkers Bobbi Brown smoky eye mascara
I've never tried buxom lash mascara I do
really like that mascara as they edit
the edgiest
up and out double mascara I've never
tried the NARS audacious is horrible
Smashbox photo-finish
lash primer and they got tried that and
I think it was just okay for me tart
tardis lash pink mascara is pretty good
the Too Faced better than sex mascara is
good it's a little clumpy but it's good
the Urban Decay perversion eye
really really like that one and the YSL
mascara volume effect those Souls
babydoll I don't mean to but tried that
one look I've tried a babydoll mascara
but I don't know if it was why I sell or
not so I'm not gonna say anything about
that but that's a full size so if you
haven't tried this really I would say
definitely you should definitely try it
if you feel like these are things that
you want to try because there's a lot of
good mess terrors in there
I like the TARDIS the better than sex
the perversion and the buxom is really
good I would say out of those that buxom
in the perversion their Urban Decay
perversion on my favorites out of those
those two are really good so yes but I
mean again I've tried a lot of these two
on like semi tried a lot of these so
this is something I'm not gonna get oh
another thing I'm not going to get which
a lot of people are getting is this the
hourglass palette i swatched it at
generation beauty and it was just kind
of I don't know I don't know
I mean I feel like that the hourglass
highlighters are best for people with
texture and skin I think they're great
for people with textured skin because
they don't accentuate texture so I think
that's really really good um but for me
I don't have enough attention so I don't
really need that you know what is up
with my shirt I don't really need that
in my life so it's just kind of okay for
me it's a little bit boring for me but
if you do have textured skin you may
really like this because it's gonna be
different from you it's been unique it's
gonna be something that you can wear
without having to worry about you know
your big pores or wrinkles or fine lines
or anything like the popping out so for
me no but I can see why people will do
you really want that cherry I says hey
no hourglass glad you know that it's not
only me yeah I just it's not super
interesting for me
Shelia says when's the next
friends-and-family scale it's usually
October when I'm not sure hundred
percent when Christian says I've decided
I don't like the better than sex my
Sarah flakes on me it clumps on me I
don't know just kind of pain in the butt
it's not my favorite in Rose production
says May
revolutions baked highlighter and
radiant lights as the bomb that's good
to know Britta says oh no my phone's at
6% you can charge a run run run nothin
you're snowing boyfriend just tipped you
in there um some fish out of water hey
my friend it says I cannot she says I
cannot wait with our glove not with our
glass and their holiday price hikes oh I
know right because they like jack up the
prices and they shrink the sizes and a
zero skin texture though and I love the
incandescent like them like moonlight
yeah I mean it's definite sunny I don't
know I like those crazy pop in from
space highlighters Felicia says better
than sex was great on her that's good to
know um Sam he said the benefit push-up
liner had really bad formula oh yes oh
yeah the push-up liner that thing was
horrible that was probably the worst
invention in all of makeup history that
thing was terrible I don't know what
they were thinking on that all right
let's look for some other stuff do I got
a bunch of stuff in there okay the other
two faced off to Mary macarons I'm gonna
skip that because I got the other two I
got this one so if you did word here
fruit from my last chat I got the
chocolate shop one two I've been using
that and without going into the full
review I feel like with this it kind of
reminds me in tone of the Gwen Stefani
palette in that there's a lot of lighter
shades in there and it's not super duper
interesting I mean like the interesting
stuff this kind of house plenum down
here um I don't know
I don't know I'm still I'm still kind of
forming my final thoughts on it sound
they're not bad and you have the by the
way if you have the peanut butter and
jelly palette and you have the purple
from the peanut butter and jelly palette
you don't like it this is the exact same
shade but they've reformulated and it's
better so just so you know yeah I mean
it's just kind of like
I didn't use enough shade yet though I
want I want to play with it like one
more time before I make my final one two
more times but my thoughts on it and
then I have to play with this before I
do my review and then by the time my
view comes out like a week because I've
actually had time to try this stuff it's
gonna be old news by them but I don't
even care I'm just gonna go with I'm
gonna go with it you know Taylor says I
use the Gwen Stefani power my natural
days and I like it yeah so but it's like
it's one of those things where I feel
like if you already own a lot of
eyeshadow like the Gwen Stefani you're
probably gonna be like you know like but
I know a lot of people love the Gwen
Stefani from my aunt my sister-in-law
has requested funny and she who loves it
absolutely home set pancake says we
trust your muse even if they're old
thank you that Joanne says blink
mascaras are amazing I love the blink
mascaras - I like the original one a lot
Church Pat says butterscotch from the
chocolate shop is stunning it is it's so
creamy finger swatches don't of course
aren't the same as for us I being on the
eye bug Jenna says she never uses her
Gwen Stefani Felicia says she loves it
Michie well she likes it and Katherine
says it's just men so we got a nice uh
nice mix yeah on Nicole Nicole from yay
or nay Nicole on YouTube she says she
likes of when blush college she likes
the shut like the shadow palette yeah
I've heard good things about the blush
palette definitely that says fYI the Kat
Von D metal palette will be available
for purchase tomorrow and the Sephora
website for $60 for the metal mats
interesting very cool see I forgot about
that it's like I bought all this stuff
already and now hmmmm nicole says the
Gwen blush is better than the shadows
there we go nice Michelle says she
regrets not getting the Gwen palette and
it was on like super sale for a hot
minute - I didn't get it either go I'm
with you another thing I'm gonna skip
from the holiday stuff is this Too Faced
blush and lip stuff
I almost got it and that was like the
lip injection that's in there you guys
the lip injection you guys tried this
thing yet oh my gosh let me show you
okay I don't know what I did with it oh
there is the lip injection more wrinkles
this stuff right here mmm
it hurts so bad I'm gonna put myself
through it just so you can see like the
pain in my eye
okay let's check this out so it's
supposed to be a lip plumper and you
guys have to tell me my lips look more
plump so here you go here's the before
for the lip injection all right new that
I can't feel anything yet it feels warm
anytime I did not summer wants to know
if I found the release date could you
get cosmetics brush set and I have it
all right we're starting to tingle
starting to tingle it smells it reminds
me of a lipgloss that I got when I was a
child as far as the smell and now it's
really tingling it's really to England
it feels like um when your foot falls
asleep and you have like pins and
needles that's what it feels like on my
lips right now feel the burn steps like
feel the burn I'm feeling it at this
point it's uncomfortable it does not
feel good he's not feel good but I just
wanted to like show you how long it
takes for it to like I don't think
there's cinnamon in here rose those
weren't enough there's cinnamon I don't
think so it doesn't feel like that says
turbo super turbo power supreme plumping
and lip gloss and at this point it is
like prickle City all over my lips John
says I'm gonna don't look it don't look
it I won't lick it I won't do it but
it's like are my lips plumper do I look
sexier right now than I did a minute ago
I'm thinking about doing a review of
this and doing like a before and after
picture to see if there actually is any
difference because I don't think there
is I don't I don't know why
burning but that's it's been you know
kind of like the buxom lipglosses how
they had that leg visit box um or maybe
was a marvelous Moxie but anyway it had
like that cooling feeling it's like that
there's another um let me see if I have
that it does the same thing I got in it
Alta it's like dr. something another's
electric lip balm or something like that
Marilyn says you're beautiful you don't
need plumping and I'm Emily probably
don't need clumping but it's good to
know whether it works you're not going
to click this I'm slowly distracting
myself I'm like popping like ADHD is
happening right now I do not have ADHD
but I feel like I'm like mirroring
something like that right now
it's like doctor something's lip balm
and it's like electric electrifying like
oh I got an old talk and it does the
exact same thing it's so weird I don't
even know Jenna says not looking any
more plump yeah I don't think so either
I'm shinier lip free thank you so much
Melanie lip break that's what it's
called it is very weird it's really
really weird
so that says fYI the a BH master palette
bad Mario will be available to purchase
on August Saudi government those website
on Thursday Thank You Beth and you are
not following that bu all for one one on
Instagram she knows all this stuff so
it's good stuff
Michelle says it made my lips a teeny
bit bigger but for a second I can't get
the same effect from I missed it one get
the same effect from eating hot wings it
is kind of like that the stuff and
Laurie have a lip plumper Therese I did
not know that Jimmy says it plumps
because your lips are here - my lips are
mad at me right now if you're a mama or
a daddy and you've got kids in the room
turn the volume down for a quick second
some of my lips are pissed off at me
right now they're like what did you do
to me why why it's they don't feel good
but I'm gonna keep it on anyway because
obviously I'm what does it is a
masochist or a sadist when you want pain
inflicted on yourself I forget which
ever one matters so it just it's just
uncomfortable like it's
not painful if I don't feel the need to
completely wipe it off but it's so but
anyway Christina says the master palette
by Mario doesn't fit my boat either I
have a feeling that honest augeas
eyeshadows are gonna be amazing from
here on it it's a masochist thank you
Karen yeah Catherine says Jen I'll top
it but I got the phone snake holder
thing for five below and love it also
got me hella me make up there yes the
mic holder thing yes I had a friend send
that to me anyway totally that was off
topic um Jen any thoughts on the jus a
metallics no thoughts I have no thoughts
I haven't tried any of their stuff but I
get I have a feeling and you can we'll
see if I'm wrong I think jus a is gonna
be the next morpheme that's gonna be
another that brand is about to blow up
they're gonna be everywhere everybody's
gonna be talking about them
the jouer is gonna be everywhere give up
give them in the next month
hooch away is gonna be everywhere safe
looks they're so uncomfortable
I might have to wipe it off who just
does not feel good all right back to the
anti halt another thing that I'm really
really tempted to get really really
tough to get are the hooda beauty lip
gloss liquid lipsticks Oh candy seer hi
candy good to see you've not candy
Johnson miss candy kar di but um yeah
I'm thinking about it thinking about it
I'm reading comments through your
affiliate codes everywhere Stephanie you
know it but what a beauty I really want
to try some of her stuff she seems legit
I don't know if you guys have tried what
a beauty but she seems legit I'm
interesting nikki says I ordered you a I
tried to make you a products they're
nice Madeline says juvies place I
shadows do or don't I don't have enough
experience with them I'll show you
here's my masquerade palette and then I
have the green one too I'm a little one
but I don't think that's available
anymore I did have fun using it it
applied very very nicely but I've only
used
the shades I used this one this one this
one and this one maybe use this one to
thank you know that one two three four
trades I've used but I need use them
more so far so good though I'm really
enjoying the ones that I tried bunnies
at one time so I can't even like I can't
review it yet so Nikki wants no
stephanie nicole is she she might be
here I don't know she subscribe to my
channel we're like internet buddies so
she might be here I love me some
Stephanie Nicole I know she didn't she
really liked the Judi s place college
but then I've heard things about their
shipping and different things negative
stuff about dubious place that's the
drama the big drama that I've heard
about GBS place is that the shipping
they have issues with customer service
lots of customer service things so
Chelsea says I want the mega Pro the
hoodie Beauty palette and Mario cotton
Kat Von D holiday party Jenna says have
you tried the nikkietutorials palette if
so where you thought to have a whole
video on that Drita I actually did an
entire video on the nikkietutorials
palette and it's actually a really good
video but I'll give you the quick
summary the quick summary is is that
swatch is horrible it goes on the eyes
better fall out sitting on the glitter
shadows so that that wasn't that's the
quick summary of what I thought of it
cheek I'll cheat shades are definitely
better than the then Ashley's so but I
mean you know it wasn't bad for me I a
Stephanie gave it a horrible review I
don't think that it's horrible but I
think she she did a lot of the arm
swatch and thing which even with a brush
I feel like they still apply that into
the eyes into the arm I don't know
so Megan wants to know if I try the
L'Oreal lipstick palette I haven't I
haven't tried it I know it's 607 I was
supposed to be off at 6 o'clock but I
was on so late I'm gonna let it run for
like another 5-10 minutes or so so let
me see there's anything else in here
that I didn't Jenna both cloud says I
just ordered Mel did you try their
product Shen I have one melt stack I
have the rough stack and I'm feeling
like
a lot it's very nice Nikki said that
Nikki palette is embarrassing I don't
think it's embarrassing
I disagree let me get my palette since
we're talking about this I don't think
it's embarrassing I really don't I
didn't tell you that I really don't like
if you didn't watch the rep you have to
watch with you because it's really good
it's one of my favorite videos about the
sugar-coated and the frosted um I hate
the glitter fallout it's stinkin
terrible but the rest of the shadows
actually going the I pretty well Ivy's a
little bit difficult to work with but
painkillers really nice makeup it shows
really nice wanted is good for a black I
really like the mystic hour and the
wham-bam those are really nice
irresistible is pretty good now one's a
little bit difficult to work with but
it's not terrible like it's pretty good
the blushes are really nice the
chocolate Soleil I feel like the
pigmentation isn't quite as their as the
original chocolate Soleil and champagne
champagne truffles are really nice
highlight like I you like the shades but
we look for what I send the video is if
you like a transformative look this is a
nice one if you looking for like every
day going to work hard stuff this isn't
probably gonna be something that has
enough for you in it but I don't mind it
I don't mind I only it's a dog collar
that's just my personal opinion so
Natalie wants to know if I've tried
wanderer beauty yet no I haven't I
haven't
Florrie says the news was jam-packed
today great show for you thank you for
all the top Laurie sparks on YouTube
she's one of our reporters she reports
on drugstore thank you for all your
contributions drugstore is the hardest
thing to find stuff on and Florrie
doesn't amazing job let's see Vegas nail
and there's a Holy Grail palette yeah
really good things about that and they
didn't get it I didn't get it summer
says they keep trying to talk myself
away from purchasing that Moorish
palette it does look amazing the
raspberry shade yes Chelsea says the
dubious pilots ever come back in stock I
don't know I'm not sure Chargers in did
I sign up for all the natural beauty
stuff I did not so dreama says she won't
support the Nicki one okay I get it
I totally get it I get it and you know I
mean I don't like to talk about
different youtubers so I'm gonna keep
you know my thing to myself
might be types of my favorite youtubers
my favorite youtubers Emily Noel 83 only
like tossing 70 Nicole of course Cassie
from terrific the people that are really
truly in it to give the audience an
honest review those are the ones that I
really care about when someone starts
off a video with obvious sponsored
content I can't stand it
I can't do it I cannot do it it just
when and then when it's not disclosed
that it's sponsored it's one thing if
you go on you say hey this is a
sponsored video I just but I do really
like this and it's amazing you know but
this is a sponsored video by this or
whatever I this brand and I really like
this or buy this product but when
someone just says oh my goodness I have
been loving this and my discount code is
below and I love this so much and my
discount coating off or you know make
sure you download this app whatever and
it's like no no I don't you've lost me
I'm done I'm done
Tara babies that's another one I really
really love absolutely absolutely
Kristin game yes Kristin game another
one absolutely love so I know Stassi is
hit or miss with some people it's all my
very very close friends are not
subscribers at all team so but I
personally still really like her videos
Jada says I think youtubers get their
products judged by their personality
sometimes which sucks yeah yeah and I
tried very hard and I do really like
kathleenlights as well that's another
one I haven't really watched a lot of
kathleenlights but I've been watching
her more recently and I don't know why I
didn't watch more before I really have
been to things like how things videos
yeah and and when I review a palette
like the nikkietutorials palette I put
the person aside you know and I I don't
know Nikki I don't know her as a person
I can't say anything about her as a
person who said do not know her I can
just review the palette as far as the
Jeffers star one
I reviewed the palette I reviewed the
palette and then I said my personal
opinions about the choices he was making
but it was this set that was separate Oh
Sabrina that's another really good one
and Jessica from Jackie
you guys are really like to drop it if
they weren't score from Vincent you're
tacky these are all ones I subscribe to
yeah it's totally what totally with you
boy says Tonti self-made she made it on
their own
I don't know Toph is history but but
yeah but anyway this is supposed to be
an anti holler off-topic Oh puppet sorry
guys you were here for anti hall and I
totally hot topic for like an hour so
I'm sorry
oh one thing I wanted to recommend if
you wanted to try some benefit products
I saw this on the Ulta website it's this
little gift kit it's really really nice
the Costa Stephanie Turkel is the
decision maker for you yeah I hear you I
hear you
this little gift set is really nice they
coming to the gimme brow the roller lash
the hoola bronzer and a professional and
I just thought that was a really nice
try except from benefit then if it has a
lot of try it sets but I thought this
one has some really good stuff in it I
think you would really really like so
just as a suggestion Kimberly Clark is
fantastic agreed I wish tymberlee Clark
put out more videos that's why I only
complain about Kimberly Clark she does
not do enough videos but I would imagine
getting into all of that makeup takes a
lot of time it's not like CY the videos
don't happen quite as often um Tiffany
says agree with me about youtubers yes
and Tiffany dawn is another but another
youtuber that I absolutely love so um
excuse me
church pants to know if I'm getting the
gimme bold lip that was another thing on
their anti hollow where's my give me
that bold lip I am NOT going to get to
give me that bold lip I'm not getting it
but I can see why any people would want
to but these shades are not ones that I
wear often I have a lot of oh yeah that
says I'm forgive me
Thank You gatherings outing nah um but
yeah I'm not gonna get the gimme the
bold lip I'm not gonna get it about
there no it's not calling to me I really
feel like that like this is a deep tone
skin tone girl's best friend like this
is like oh my gosh if I had a deeper
skin tone I would get this in a
heartbeat
and a heartbeat but I already have a lot
of shades like this I don't think I
would use it I don't think I would use
it oh we got em Jenna
you so much I didn't read that thank
goodness but I'm not going to be getting
either the little kids I thought the
leap kit last year and I reviewed it the
last look hit before this look kid I
reviewed that one so I'm not going to do
another one right now
if I didn't have a makeup channel and
didn't have a stupid amount of makeup I
would probably get the original over the
bulbs because it fits my personal taste
but this is the only support favorite
skin I'm going to get as of now I would
imagine support would come out with at
least one more maybe a couple more of
the favorites kits before the holidays I
think this is like the pre holiday rush
and then there's gonna I think there's
gonna be another wave of it I do Marc
Jacobs lip kit I don't know how much
that is Jenna I'm sorry Jill says julep
is an A+ company I have had no problems
with julep as a brand but other people
have I am NOT J doll must know how to
tried to Kylie lip kits I have not
I've not tried them I don't really have
much of an interest o update on the lip
injection it's starting to feel normal
yeah now it just fills up a lip gloss I
can barely I can barely feel it on my
lips now as far as the detailing that's
pretty much gone just so you guys know
as far as its time very than that but
yeah the anti holes are amazing yeah
Christian says I fell in love with
Kimberly Clark same time hole she this
is you can for all the time
Joan wants to know if I tried the next
liquid lip liner I have not I have not
Danielle says the blush bill is very
pigmented it shows up well were one in
the summer heat yesterday and came out
with blush komen shoots nice well done
Thank You Danielle for that information
that's great BB says my lips look
plumper do that yeah I don't know I
can't tell I can't see myself right now
so Devorah says can you Wow can you pop
the blushes
out of the tart wheel like you can with
a single ooh that's a good question I do
not know I'm not even sure so Becca says
I'm not gonna buy makeup holiday kids
until makeup come to get back in their
Lane and do Halloween sets with Matthew
smart you know what's funny if you look
on trends the word makeup shoots up in
Google Trends
and we're single October so you would
think that they would put out more
makeup in October as far as like
Halloween makeup because I really think
that's why it shoots up as because of
all the Halloween makeup tutorials so
well I don't wants to know about Becca
split hands I have not tried them I can
tell you I do really like my own the
globe hit this one I was surprised at
how many people got this sent to them I
did not give it to me I bought mine at a
meet-up said I had on my road trip I do
really like this I haven't used it as
much as I would love because I'm trying
long tighters now but I do really like
this the highlighters don't last a
really long time on me the I finally got
got the blushes might last a lot longer
on even the highlights but I've heard
the formula is exactly the same in the
split cans as in this so I haven't
looked at that I haven't actually
compared them next to each other oh my
goodness
Alana's here and tear babies video she
said that some of the Tarte holiday
products were made in China where as
most of the products American made Oh
interesting you know I mean I feel like
the argument for the made in China thing
is more um you know a lot of people
believe in not buying things that are
made in China
period but I think a quality product can
be produced in China I don't feel like
it's fair to say just because it's made
in China it's not a quality product I
don't know what Tara said but I feel
like that's kind of unfair to say but I
can also see why someone would say I
never buy things manufacture in China
for other reasons I'm not gonna go into
all the reasons you can do but diamond
says Jenny moth and Niki palette in the
chocolate shop well I lost it woman Niki
pound the chocolate chocolates yes I'll
show you something I think actually you
guys this last week I'll show you this
again mystic

I want to know I want to look at Jared
and the guys and go what were you
thinking why did you do that this pilot
just came out what were you thinking
it's the exact same shape it's exactly
this thinking say like I'm looking at it
trying my part is to find a difference
and I cannot see a difference and I want
them to be different and they're not and
it's annoying so but anyway all right
guys I've been on four officially an
hour
my family's probably wondering what in
the world I'm doing because they're
ready to dinner so I should probably hop
off here but if you have been here since
the beginning I want to thank you so

month or so when more stuff comes out I
