the lux at the makeup chat it is so
great to have you back here this week
this Sunday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time
that's what our tech chats usually are
so if you're curious about when you can
join chat that's the time next week
there won't be a chat though because we
will be I will be in New York next
weekend for Generation beauty by epsy so
if you're there and you see me you
please please I hope you are okay with
coming up and saying hi me because I
would love to meet you I think that
would be awesome it's one of my favorite
things about going to generation beauty
is moving people that watch the channel
like I love it I absolutely love it so
don't hesitate to pump and see me and
say hi if you see me attentively
so anyway today we're gonna be talking
about some indie makeup brands I feel
like you're like excuse me we are like
inundated right now with products all
over there everybody seems to be getting
a jump on the holidays like a week
earlier every year does it seem like
that to you or is it just me that like
brands are just jumping on thing I mean
it's the middle of September and a lot
of a holiday stuff has already dropped
by the time it hits mid November there's
not gonna be anything left you know well
yeah it used to be they would at least
wait until like getting closer to
Halloween but mid September I just put
my fall stuff I realized that in my
videos though all you can see is things
give thanks which doesn't make any sense
so I might have to change that so as I
say in all things give thanks but you
know it doesn't really have its meaning
if you chop the top off but anyway we're
getting to like bombarded with all these
major makeup brands all these major
releases and I thought like it might be
a good thing to kind of focus on some of
these independent beauty brands as you
may know I did look into starting my own
indie makeup brand at one point and it
is this
offensive to just produce one product
like just making one eyeshadow pallete
was gonna be thousands and thousands
dollars just in production
that's not even with like actually
buying the pilots first you know and
then expect him to sell them I mean it's
just it's outrageous just for one
thought it's unbelievable
so these brands have really invested a
lot and I feel like they don't get
enough hype especially the really really
good ones where I feel like they just
kind of fly under the radar I do have a
giveaway coming up on Instagram with one
of these brands and I'll give you more
information on that every minute but
before we do I do want to say hello to
the collective you know make a possible
also known as the people who are here in
live chat they're going to also be
giving their opinions on these indie
brands and talk about some of their
favorite indie brands which I feel is a
lot more valuable than just getting my
opinion we're gonna get the opinion of
all of them as well so I'm gonna go
ahead and scroll over and we're gonna
see who is here today I'm gonna scroll
all the way up to the top and the first
people are seen here was Ben she is good
morning and Lee is here Afton fine good
morning to you and Christina is here
love the live chat highlight of my week
oh that's so wonderful
I know live chat isn't for everybody
there are some people they just don't
like this format it's totally cool but
I'm not gonna kill it just because you
don't like it there's a lot I really do
like it and you don't like it and
there's lots of things you can watch and
I respect your opinion but I'm not gonna
stop doing lunch at it's not gonna
happen I've been doing it for years and
I love it I love hanging out with a
community it's fun and there's stuff to
watch you know like that it's totally
cool
deirdre good morning to you and Tabitha
my friend good morning Connie is here
Nadine is here good morning so I'm
loving it's having a Renee as the way
I'm going to pronounce that I hope that
I'm saying that correctly good morning
to you Paul is here good morning to you
Melissa and the gold digger in that huh
who remember to bring the doughnuts I
did I do have coffee for myself though
Michelle good morning to you I still
haven't talked to you in like a week and
a half which I don't think I have
hopefully you're doing well Michelle
I've been thinking of you amber good
morning to you mama Shana in that house
top of the morning to you then watching
a little Housewives Oh
you know I've never seen a an episode of
a full episode of like the Real
Housewives or any of those shows ever
well Paul's gonna go get some donuts oh
I'll be right back
reading mom in the house Caroline and
bottle flour good morning finally we're
never to come early to watch Lisa and
Jacqueline thanks so much for being here
and everybody else that I didn't get a
chance to sink low - hello - you happy
to have you here so I have no I Beast
I'd like a table full of any makeup and
I don't know where I'm gonna start
I do want to warn you I'm an eyeshadow
junkie so a lot of this is eyeshadow
it's mostly eye shadow and lip products
so I feel like indie brands really try
to focus on eye shadow and lip products
I feel like those are where a lot of
people have their loves and their
passions one or the other I'm sure it's
what your love is passion is whether you
would choose eyeshadow or lipstick me
I'm an eyeshadow person but I do have a
lot of lipsticks here to show you as
well
neisha is about to turn 18 so she can
join the but to pick up its foot people
will be happy to have you that's awesome
all right so let's go ahead and start
you know what let's just start with her
Santa Ana because I write here
Renea Cosmetics is an indie brand for
Santa's a friend of the channel and she
came out with this Olympus palette I'm
not sure if you remember a while back
there was a watch ad much so if you were
here but she dropped the price for us
it's relatively inexpensive anyway
it's I forget the exact price I don't
have prices on everything here I'm sorry
I didn't have time to organize it
because I got this as a brainstorm idea
like at the very last minute but this I
know this is very inexpensive for an
eyeshadow palette this is the Olympus
palette everything is named after Greek
gods and goddesses and Christina dropped
by what I mentioned this the first time
and shilling drop the price is like 25%
off for us throwing that chat and
everybody was like jumped over a bunch
of Fallot which i think is really cool
if you bought one I would love to know
what you think of it in any way
Christina and I are gonna do a giveaway
on Instagram so if you're following me
on Instagram all you're gonna have to do
is follow me and her on Instagram in
order to then that's it it isn't gonna
be like you know you got to do this and
this and this and this you just have to
follow both of us so she's giving
an eyeshadow palette on the Olympus
palette and she's also giving away my
favorite liquid lipstick shade from her
brand this is the shade Kate thanks bye
and I'll swatch that for you and I
thought this would be a good one to give
away because I feel like this could work
on a lot of different skin tones it's
one of those you know berry shades it's
really trendy for fall and you know I
thought it would work for a lot of
people so this one I thought was a good
choice I do have all of her liquid
lipsticks they are a little bit more
drying but they are a little more long
wearing so it's one of those kinds of
formulas so you have to assign your
personal preference because everyone's
personal preference for liquid lipsticks
is different but just so you know that's
the kind of formula we've got here and
then she just came out with a new line
of eyeshadows and they are single pan
eyeshadows and there I have used them on
my eyes yet I just swatch them so just
on yesterday day before yesterday I
haven't had a chance put in my eyes but
oh my gosh these things are amazing so
this one is called NYX NYX is a Greek
god I think of God or like I'm not a god
but like a half God or a demigod or some
kind of thing Greek mythology so NYX
isn't just NYX Cosmetics mixed but if
this purple with these blue sparkles in
it and it's really pretty I'm gonna do a
double swatch there just to make sure
you get the full pigmentation they are
buildable so they do take a little bit
of building here and there but that's
not always that's not a bad thing at
least for me then we've got this mermaid
green here this one's one swipe
well one dip into the pan this one is
called Jeep
daya Deo and then we have this one here
this one is called Tartarus and it's
like a bronzy gold I'm gonna do two
swatches into that one there's that one
and then we have this one it's called
eros and it's like a pink it's a good
neon pink that's one swatch and I'm
gonna do one more right there
and then the last one this one I feel it
is ridiculously you let me get my
childhood Oh what my fingers this one I
think
gillich is the most unique this is
called Erebus goddess of the night
beauty song says NYX is thank you so
much for that I appreciate it okay this
one is blue but it's got some really
cool ships in it it's got like light
blue glitter and purple glitters in it
you can see that oh my gosh they're like
if you like dramatic looks they're
gorgeous
I have again I haven't tried on my eyes
so I've only swatch them so I can't
speak to that but they're borders so for
Santa Anna and I are gonna vote for
Santa's gonna give away the all the
cygnets at OHS the olympus palette and
the liquid lipstick on instrument
giveaway my channel this week so keep an
eye up for that and make sure you're
following both of us on instagram for
more information so let me go ahead and
wipe that off so that's kristina and
cosmetics and again she is the friend of
the show and art the show the channel
and i just adore her she's amazing okay
so i'm gonna go ahead and click her
sanded down and let's talk about some
more brands this is one that i was very
surprised by my friend Nancy sends me I
don't know if you know my friend Nancy I
talk about her all the time she is my a
my guardian angel of makeup she lets me
try all kinds of things that I wouldn't
have gotten to try otherwise I mean
she's just amazing
but this is a persona I the persona
identity palette supposedly this is very
hard to get I've heard but their quality
of this eyeshadow palette is amazing
look at that I mean it's a neutral
palette it's nothing you know shade wise
that I feel like is super unique but the
quality of these shadows it's really
really good and if you're just looking
for a good solid neutral palette it is
very high-quality I definitely recommend
this one I've used this probably three
or four times and every time I've been
like wow just blown away by the quality
of the shadows not really amazing eye
looks out of it I mean it's pretty
ordinary but if I took this and then I
threw in like for example like this
in there it's like I brought it to a new
level or just brought in like these
cooler shades and then brought in like
this moment that maybe did a little bit
of blue with some of these over here
look how cool would that look so I mean
you can't don't ever limit yourself to
one palette there's like so many things
you can do just bringing in one brighter
color from another color or one
brightness in the shadow you can totally
transform and give yourself so many more
obstinate and people get stuck in the
one palette thing but yeah this is
really really nice
Rachel said they're sold out are these
sold out like forever I hope not because
they're really good I haven't looked at
their website in a really long time
though but if you can get your hands on
this I definitely recommend it I'll stop
talking about it since you said it's not
available okay this is another brand
that's a friend of the channel this is
solar look there are shadows are also
very very high quality this is the
Flashdance palette this one's actually
my favorite they also came out with the
dirty dance and palette not that long
ago but the Flashdance how it is really
good especially if you love mattes
they're gigantic pans the pans were
trying Norma's you're never gonna run
out of these things I remember talking
to people so look and saying I wish that
they had done like half the be size pans
and done twice as many shades that's
just my opinion Shelly wants to know if
I grabbed the color pop I think I love
you pellet no I you know I haven't
really done a lot of color pop lately
just because they're kind of everywhere
and I like to do like the ones that
people are super curious about like the
rod which caught the Rihanna the fancy
beauty I'm working on a review that I'm
working on the two-faced stuff but then
I like to kind of bring in things that
are different a little bit different and
color top lately just hasn't been
exciting me and hasn't really made me go
wow I was kind of interested in like
their unicorn stuff and try to get it
and it sold out really fast I was like
well that's that I guess I'm not doing
that
and then she'll probably bring you more
color pop stuff but for now I'm kind of
taking a break from them but yes and
this is there's really really good
quality so this is the Flashdance
palette and then this one here is
The Dirty Dancing talent they have it
packaged like a VHS tape but their thing
is so cool this was for the anniversary
and this these are all in conjunction
with these movies like with Lionsgate
and things like that
and you open it up and it's like a VHS
tape and inside you have your shadows
you have four shadow for shadows and a
highlighter and then a lip product and
the lip product was with there was a
youtuber that our Instagram our ish
Tabitha who was this it was the lipstick
which do you remember I can't read what
her name is
it's like out of my head she's like
really popular I can't remember what her
name is
do you remember so I can't remember this
is called baby and then these are this
is cha-cha I carry the watermelon
merengue back to the playpen and Johnny
Castle and right here it says nobody
puts Baby in a corner
so it's like the ultimate eye shadow for
Dirty Dancing lovers hmm Tamm says for
panel shows bug me I prefer at least
eight yeah I'd like to have a lot of
shadows of my pilots as well I'm with
you
Joanna says the celebrity makeup brands
don't catch my eye I'm much rather indie
brands yeah and I'm glad that you're
here because I think this is gonna be a
good chat for you the quality of the
soul look I showed house is really
really good I wasn't the biggest fan of
the layout of the Dirty Dancing palette
of the shade selection but the quality
is very good so and the nostalgia of it
is very good these are from solo lucam
most of these on these indie brands you
just have to go to the it just google
search for the nd brand name solo Lucas
about Sol a ello okay and then Chris
Anna Ann is kr RI s a.m. and a and then
a and n Kristina and cosmetics wants to
check out so this is persona identity
and the website here is persona
cosmetics comm co their stone on
cosmetics comp oh yeah I can't remember
what her name is either tabatha I don't
know it's put out of my head I used to
know it really well when that's how it
first came out
Shauna says oh but the colour-pop yes
please palette is different
I've been having so much fun with it
some neat colors all Shona I totally
believe you I totally believe you man
and I should get it I know I should but
it's like I'm drowning right now and
stuff that I want to review and I need
to get for you I want to get through the
stuff that I have Y purchased any more
I'm starting to go into overload with
all the holiday stuff but let's talk
about this brand because this was a
brand it's just the one is it limited
clouds it has advent calendar just say
I'm getting confused all these nice
things I have to look I don't think it
is only this lunatic labs with the
advent calendar which we must along with
the advent calendar I almost bought it
and I didn't but I thought about it but
anyway let's talk about lunatic labs
depeche girl thank you so much Maribel
got it that was the one that
collaborated with the Dirty Dancing
palette with the lip product thank you
so much for that I appreciate who's
driving me bonkers but lunatic Labs have
tried a couple things from them I have
some of their lip products they were
just okay for me but this is the contour
palette it is a bit pricey but the
quality is really really really good
it's extremely cool tone so you have to
be digging on that I remember when I
first reviewed this I talked about these
and being very difficult to contour
because it excuse me because they're so
great but a lot of people really do
enjoy a more great contour so it works
well for them I like that there's a nice
range of light to deep they do have one
of these that's like a second version of
this I can't remember exactly what it
looks like but I want to say it had a
little bit more bold colors Isabelle
notoriously morbid is the one that had
the advent calendar you are a hundred
percent right it was notoriously morbid
that's the one where I was like do I
want this advent calendar or do I not
want to get it and I decided not to get
it I'm just kind of drowning in things
you know I just I want to get through
what I've got right now
so anyway really really loving this I
think it's a fantastic palette and I
really love this quality it's really
very good
alright um let's see Olivia says the
lunatik contour palettes go on sale
constantly oh good to know banshee me
says I bought ELISA claps eyeshadow
palette they're good and cute packaging
nice Kimberly Clark what a Mac I swear
those songs I need to come up with a
song you know Kimberly's got a song
Laura's got a song I need a song
Cassie's got a song why's that song
forever I used to do that's not good
enough I need a better song than that
I'm gonna have to said she loves it okay
she loves what Oh Kimberly Clark loves
the the lunatic laughs I wouldn't guess
you're right I think you're right Betty
Ann say in my first hi Betty Ann how are
you my all-time favorite eyeshadow pod
is the Laura Mercier artist palette and
the Becca ombre Rouge nice those are not
indie brands but nice I love you so much
I think everybody loves Kimberly Clark I
know anybody don't know if Emily Clark I
do not love - really Clark all right
let's go into some more popular brands I
just want to touch on because I've
talked about these to death Julia's
place is one my favorite indie brands if
I were gonna pick something to get from
Jimmy's place if you're just getting one
thing I would say choose the eyeshadow
palette the eyeshadows the I shout outs
are amazing excuse me
I am I think I have almost every one of
their eyes shouts except for the new
ones oh my gosh okay let me just watch
the foils they are like the Queen's of
foiled shadows the mats are good too but
the foils are you kidding me are you
kidding me
they are like so good
there's no good I love them the blush
pound is really good as well the
eyeliners if I was gonna do another one
of those products I've changed my mind
about eyeliners dried Aulani
one of them was my fault because I left
it slightly open the other one was
completely sealed and it was still very
dried out and I've had him for what with
six months or so not good I was very sad
about that but the blush palette yes
very very good on the blush palette I've
used it a handful of times you can tell
I haven't used it a ton but I've really
been gravitating toward these shades
right here
these are a little bright for me they're
a little bit too well but I really like
these over here I don't use this one
but this was more of a highlight missus
like a blush and a highlight in one it's
very very bright though so you have to
kind of apply it with a light hand I
know that looks the same it's gonna go
straight to clown face but if you're
gentle with it you can really get a nice
nice color on the cheeks you just have
to put with a fluffy brush Judy's place
brushes are amazing they're really
really good I definitely recommend in
GDS place brushes I have I bought all my
Judy's place stuff they they said they
were gonna send me stuff and then it
never happens so I just bust they do
show up on what looks sometimes for for
discount and they do a lot of sales
ingenious place they're very reasonably
priced one isn't as reasonably priced
but is very good as coloured raine
coloured raine eyeshadows are amazing I
cannot wait for their quads that come
out this is the Queen of Hearts palette
it's now permanent and you can get this
but there's one shade in here called
ladyship it's not my favorite but other
than that I really love this again the
foiled shadows let me do a little
swatches they're a little softer a
little crumb layer than the other let's
just do this orange one there then the
gb/s plays pouch should have to be a
little more delicate because they're not
packed as tightly but I don't think I've
ever seen a bad review of this palette
like ever I mean what are you kidding me
what I do wish that they weren't so
expensive though I feel like cold rain
is really raising their prices like
their price program I put the new the
new palettes I feel like they're
overpriced for how many shadows you get
but they're you I mean they're very high
quality so they have I feel like I have
a right to charge that with the quality
that they've got but jeebies plays I
think is gonna give them a run for their
money because I feel like Julius place
is just as good yeah just as good at
about half the price so you know I mean
I think that they have a right to to
charge that but at the same time
I mean Julius place is gonna be a more
affordable option for something very
similar and they're gonna have to really
take it into gear to stay ahead of
duties
faced with that placement all right
let's move on actually let me say can
you tell us which one leadership is sure
I can tell you that LexA that is this
one right here it's just a little patchy
I'll swatch it for you it's one of those
gritty shadows it's just pretty it's
it's it's not um it's kind of difficult
to work with that one that one's not
good Juvia spans are huge yes especially
in the original the original mastery
palette Shauna says you up the price cut
anyway yeah I mean they're they're very
expensive and I feel like another brand
that's very expensive that I feel like
it's a really good brand but they're
very expensive is Mount Kosciuszko well
I think it's not the rough stack but
it's close to the rough staff these are
really good these are matte shadows
they're very high quality they're
wonderful they're easy to use very
blendable they're just really expensive
you know and I just I don't know I mean
I think Judy's place is doing the right
thing just high quality and low cost I
mean they're gonna they're gonna blow up
if anybody picks them up like if Ulta
decides to carry dubious place which I
think they should also starting to give
you know dose of colors a chance and and
you know all these other indie brands
starting to give them a chance and I
just wish that they would give Julia's
place a chance because oh my gosh
amazing absolutely amazing oh I love you
too let's welcome Cindy was on the fence
about the Queen of Hearts because of the
price but you write about Julia's place
the price is great it's amazing it's so
much less expensive Jensen's here she
says is it is I'm a my frozen Oh No
refresh refresh yet sit refresh
oh man okay Jacqueline says all just
killing it with their new brands I think
it's really smart of them to take some
of the hottest indie brands and start
selling them I think it's really really
smart because it gives the any brand
chance to be more known and it also
gives them a chance to get more sense I
mean it makes sense makes sense but
anyway know does a great brand as far as
the eyeshadow vignettes and going out
I've tried buy them but they're Percy
they're really Percy speaking of dose of
colors let's go into a little bit of
dose of colors I meant to grab the eye
shot
down there I really like the eyeshadow
 I also really love the liquid
lipstick this is true of my favorite
shade this is truffle and chocolate
wasted chocolate wasted I never thought
I would like a dark brown like this but
this is the Chris Anna acted by the way
I cannot get it off my hands
this is Joseph colors chocolate wasted I
never thought I would like this it just
looks like a melted chocolate bar is
what it looks like it's I use this a lot
of times with other liquid lipsticks
when I want to make them more Brown I'll
just add like little dots of chocolate
wasted into it that's what I did for
whatsapp and makeup this past week I've
been here was what's a good makeup no it
wasn't one second makeup it was the the
truth series one I did a two faced
melted matte and then I put dot two
chocolate wasted over it and it made it
a little more Brown which is what I was
going for a little more fall-like so I
use this a lot of time these mixers I
have won it on its own as well and then
truffle is gorgeous too truffle is more
of like a new shade just like a needy
eat pure sauces I would never be able to
finish a melt Staffie me either either
Isabelle wants to know have you tried
the notoriously morbid liquid lipsticks
I don't believe I have I don't think so
one thing I don't recommend from dose of
colors is their ideal duos these just
fall flat
the base is I feel like aren't the
formulas not great on the bases so when
you you put the base down and then
you're supposed to put the glitter on
top of it but the base doesn't hold the
glitter and it ends up falling
everywhere and they may need to work on
the base formula if they do and if they
make the base formula better I think
that this is gonna be a better product
but they're very expensive for what you
get especially since it doesn't really
work without like a glitter glue or
something I wish that the base was able
to stand on its own and be able to hold
the glitter on it so I don't recommend
until duo's unfortunately
Ashley wants to know if I know I wonder
if Davina is going to feature on here I
love that brand I don't know anything
from Divina cosmetics we talk about them
often on what's it been makeup but I
don't own anything
by them I'm sorry I don't good to know
that you love them though let's see
let's go on to okay
this is Velvet 59 I did get a couple of
these pallets this was the one I liked
better the other one I've decluttered
this one is the it says hybrid on it
so this is the rose metal to call it so
it's got metallic shades and it's got
one matte shade over here this was just
okay for me it's a good palette um I
liked the color selection I think she
did a really nice job in the clothes
selection she did talk some trash about
me on Instagram though so I won't be
buying anything or trying anything else
from her brand I had somebody come to my
channel and like about she want her
Instagram stories I was like no I didn't
know so I won't be buying anything else
from Velvet 59 because you know she
couldn't take constructive criticism so
you know and they said they she didn't
mention me directly by name but I have
just released my review where I was
talking about they didn't think that
they were on fee enough and I think they
had enough pizazz to them and she was
like well whatever you know and I didn't
see it personally so you know I just
heard it and I'm done and it was from a
trusted source from a subscriber that I
trust and know and known for a long time
so because of who it came from I
believed it even though I didn't see
with my own eyes and yeah just basically
that she was like whatever you know kind
of whatever you know like if that's not
good enough for her than whatever you
know like just she was just salty about
my review instead of just being like you
know I don't know I didn't like that so
so anyway um Velvet 59 is even though
that I do I did like this eyeshadow
palette it was okay I'm not a fan of
that and also I did not like her lip
products
I like the lip gloss but I didn't like
the lipstick for the price point it was
very like cheap drugstore e to me and
that's what I said in review I have a
full review and I think she just she
didn't take kindly to my review I guess
but I mean I can understand when you put
your heart and soul into something and
someone doesn't like it
then it's painful it's hurtful and I I
get it I totally get it but I don't
think I want to review any more
interesting anyway moving on another
brand that has been very missed for me
which breaks my heart because their
packaging is so cute is beyond beauty
bakery stuff and I want to love this
the owner seems like such a sweetheart
I've watched videos from her and she
seems like such a sweetheart and I want
to love this palette but I don't this is
the Neapolitan ice cream ice cream
palette and it's just again it just
falls flat for me I actually like the
velvet cookie nom palette better than
this one
this one I used it maybe three or four
times and I was like every eyeshadow
look I did I was just like I couldn't I
couldn't get it to look good you know
and maybe it's my era maybe it's
operator error I don't know I mean the
packaging is absolutely adorable I
haven't tried everything from this brand
Mia tried some of their liquid lipsticks
too and I wasn't a fan of those either
and it made me sad because I again I
love the packaging and the owner seems
like a real sweetheart but I just
haven't been a fan of the things I've
tried from this so on you know by the
way the 79 that happened like six months
to a year I mean was the long time it
was whenever that video came out and I
just never talked about it because I
never brought up the brand again I never
talked about it again but you know I am
a little upset and hurt that she would
say something like that but you know it
is what it is it's okay but anyway
moving on who is she cosmetics I've
tried a bunch of stuff from them I
really like their lip um the lip
composites from who is she cause knives
I think that's it who makes the lip
composites correct me if I'm wrong he's
wrong with people
oh my gosh Wow okay so anyway thank you
to my moderators for cleaning up the
mess going on so but anyway this is who
is she Cosmetics this is one of their
highlight palettes this was really
glittery I mean you can see it from
it is just so glittery I mean some of
its an overspray like this one you can
see that I've wiped the overspray off
but yes am i right on the lip composite
the lip gloss or fantastic Tiffany I
think they're really good yes their name
is who is she
that's the name of the brand this was
pretty good
it's just hmm it's a little intense but
it looks intense I mean when you buy
something like this you know it's
intense
and it is fun to use but I think that
you have to be in the market for
something like this in order to but a
lot of it is over spring like this
glitter here is all overspray you can
see that it's gone from here and what
you're left with is some shimmer which
is I like a lot better than the glitter
but you do have to break through that
good at first there's a couple of them I
haven't used but I haven't used this one
yet
and I have use this as eyeshadow and I
do like it as eyeshadow but it's kind of
powdery as a shadow so like you know
cheap products are less pigmented
sometimes on purpose so that you don't
go straight to clown face that's kind of
the way I feel about these products so
far so when you go to put them on the
eye
they're not super punch implemented like
I like my eyeshadows like my eyeshadow
looks to be like BAM in your face so
yeah this has been kind of a I'm not
really I don't know if it's made from
unique annika not that's a bad product
like stronk it's made for me but I do
like their lip composite let me get a
couple of second thought to grab those
okay this is one this is in the shade
Vampira I'm sorry Danny there julia is
like oh my I just can't with the
overspray just why stop this already on
Nikki okay so this is a lip composite
and what I've used these for is you can
use them on their own or you can use
them to top and mix with other lip
products kind of put back here they're
kind of like an intense lip gloss see
how it kind of sheers out a little bit
Mimi's like you need to try feathering
her body I do I know
but you can share it out I mean it's
still got a lot of pigments and I really
like them they're on there like an
intense gloss but they're not sticky at
all they are more oily than sticky but
not super oily where you're feeling like
your lips are oily but you know what
they mean they haven't worked like an
oily phase and I knew like them again
this is a shade Vampira it looks like
this inside the pot and they're really
fun they aren't pricey but you get a lot
in them
this one is Oh doesn't say how much you
get in them but it's a decent mean it
looks like it's just a little bit in
this little tiny pot but if you
stretched it out into the lipgloss tube
then you would see that it is a decent
about a product and you only need the
tiniest little bit to put on your lips
the big the big want want on those as
you are dipping your finger in it so you
want to make sure you have clean hands
when you do dip your finger in it or dip
let the lip brush or something like
clean lip brush or something in it so
you don't bacteria it all up and make it
go bad faster that's that's kind of the
only bummer on those yeah they're an
intense lip gloss Erica yes absolutely
and I have your giveaway prize I'm just
I just need to bubble wrap everything up
Erica one was one of the winners from
you giveaway that we did they are cool
all right
we can't talk about lip products without
talking about my girl is Shani from
total makeup junkie 101 and Ronnie
cosmetics these are her spark to
dazzling liquid lipsticks and spark
dazzling lipsticks the let me give you a
little breakdown the comparison between
these two they both have glitter in them
they both have scent so you know be
aware of that and the thing is about the
glitter in both formulas is they don't
hang around your lips beyond the product
so that's really really good I'm
noticing what the lipsticks that they
are a little hard as they get older
they're starting to harden a little bit
so they're a little bit more difficult
to apply now than they were when I first
got them but I Stu still really enjoy
them I actually wore I think it was
syrup to the Renaissance Fair last
weekend in Marilyn meadow sauce very
last weekend and it lasted me forever I
was a little nervous to wear it because
I wasn't sure like whether it was gonna
last through all like the crazy foods
you'd at the Renaissance Fair and
everything but it did and it faded so
gracefully but they are getting a little
bit hard so just be aware they're not
they don't stay as clean as they are
when you first get them they get a
little bit you know you just kind of dry
a little bit and get a little more dense
now the liquid lipsticks are a little
less intense as far as the glitter so
more glitter in the lipsticks left
litter in the liquid lipsticks but but
overall you're gonna see glitter in both
and I do really like them both I mean
even though they are a little bit harder
to apply the lipsticks now than they
were when I first got them I still
really enjoy them and I hope that they
kind of give a stain to the lips so even
after they've worn off even after the
glitter is gone and you still have that
color on your lips and it's very even
which I very rarely will find in the
lipstick so I personally think it's
worth it and I love both these four
knives I think he's Shani did a
fantastic job she did send me those for
review but it was not a sponsored review
she didn't pay anything she just sent
them something I'm just reading and see
if I'm missing anything
Oh Tiffany's having trouble at the chat
I'm sorry and cosmetics in the yes M
cosmetics is in D I have tried some nd
some M cosmetic stuff I don't have here
but I can talk about it very quickly the
liquid lipstick formula is almost
identical to the bare minerals gem nude
so if you like the bare Manoli genu you
like you will like the M cosmetics and
liquid lipsticks they're almost
identical in um in formula there is
their very slight differences they smell
the same they feel the same the the
formula the ingredient deck is almost
exactly the same the eyeliners from M
cosmetics are also really good but
honestly I like the nips epic ink better
I wouldn't go as far these is to get the
end cosmetics one and cosmetics is owned
by Michelle Phan by the way who was a
big who tuber for a longest time she
owns FC
she doesn't want to make as many YouTube
videos now because she's like business
lady and does all of that kind of like
how Marlena from nigga Pete doesn't only
make as many videos anymore
Michelle doesn't only make as many
videos but if you're new to you - he may
not know who she is but I mean just I
really enjoyed her makeup tutorials back
in the day especially like her
transformation
but anyway the em cosmetics brand was
rebranded it was owned by partially by
L'Oreal and then she bought it back so
now it's just her brand
so yeah the liquid liquid lipsticks are
really really good the eyeliners I would
say they're good but I would say get the
next other thing instead it's a lot
cheaper and I think it's better bancini
says
livecrime liquid lipsticks are so
drawing I've never tried their liquid
lipsticks I have tried their regular
lipsticks and I didn't think that they
were fantastic Isabel wasn't about Shira
cosmetics and yes I can tell you about
Sheryl cosmetics what do I have to come
sure I know I have some anything Shiro
do I have zero oh when I got from Shiro
I got the Harry Potter collection from
Shiro and I loved it I absolutely loved
it unfortunately it's not available
anymore but they had the every flavor
lip gloss so what he did was he ordered
the lip gloss and they put a flavor in
it and you didn't know what flavor you
were gonna get and I don't know what
kind I got but it's like I only wore it
like once it's really weird I did not
like the shade it's like a butterscotch
you something I don't even know even
know but I don't use this you couldn't
like straight up below I didn't I didn't
realize it was gonna be like a purpley
blue and when I got that but anyway
these were really cool this is Apollo
juice lip gloss and this was Felix bliss
is Felix was this is gorgeous
I use this as a topper over other
lipsticks
it looks really yellow but when you mix
it with like a peep it'll turn like a
coral shade with this beautiful like
shimmer shine to it it's gorgeous I
think work is and then this one makes
really weird the Polyjuice want it
smells terrible
because Polyjuice potion if you've never
peep you don't know Harry Potter stuff
is supposed to taste nasty and it's
nasty on purpose I guess it's oh it's
both terrible other you know this guy
that it's like plants and it smells like
plants I guess like if you went out into
a garden and spray perfume kind of thing
like but like plants not flowers like
plants greenery but yeah it just gives a
little green shift to the lipsticks I
use this a whole lot because I don't
really found a good use for it but the
Polyjuice if you
Celeste this one I really like this is
this was the love potion in Harry Potter
I also got the butterscotch lip gloss
which I can't find because I use it all
the time it must be my purse or
something that one is amazing and soft
butter viewer lip gloss so that's all
I've tried from from Sheryl cosmetics
but I did enjoy what I tried I would
like to try more at some point Erica
says that it's more like herbs
no no whose plants Julie says Pichet I
should especially since the lip gloss
and I can't Oh amber says Harry Potter
is still available from Shiro are you
kidding me it wasn't it wasn't um it
wasn't uh it wasn't available last time
I looked
oh my gosh Mercedes it says that yeah
smells on makeup something I want to eat
Michelle says I was going to say walking
through a bargain with marigolds yes
Michelle you are you named it Michelle
that's what it smells like it kind of
smells in their bones you are a hundred
do you have this don't you do you have
this right okay
that is awesome your Nathan another
brand I really really like a lot that I
haven't I feel it does not get enough
height as MBA Cosmetics MBA cosmetics I
do know someone that works for MBA
cosmetics that she gave me some things
but I'm not like affiliated with them or
anything
these eyeshadows are so good they're
just loose eyeshadows if you don't like
this eyeshadows you'll probably want to
skip these but and you like glitter oh
my gosh these are amazing use the foil
effects letters this is in the shape
Holy Grail you do need a glitter glue
with this and they don't hide that you
need glitter glue they will they do sell
glitter glue but oh my gosh I'll use
this one day and everybody's on your
eyes like yup and they're very
reasonably priced if you like this kind
of thing they have like there's up a
base in there of like some kind of like
oily base in there that holds it all
together
but you definitely do need a glitter
glue to keep it on your eye it will
initially apply like this but it will
fall out if you don't have glitter on
glitter glue on it
drop it like right off but really
high-quality if you look at MBA
cosmetics Instagram you'll be able to
see a lot of beautiful looks that people
created with MBA cosmetic stuff highly
recommend that brand just very high
quality and people are super nice so
that's that's another one that I wanted
to mention what is this now that's not
helpful
Twitter okay that's not gonna work okay
for brows one thing I wanted to mention
oh I got a skip down in the chat mission
not missing anything
Steph says chlorophyll went like Bora
Phil oh my god what is that from that is
from Adam Sandler from the one where he
goes to school okay

the taste of coffee but I really enjoy
the smell of it oh that's interesting I
love coffee obviously

doar Oh at IMATS
I just dropped the card and they were
like let me get this stuff oh my gosh
this stuff is so inexpensive and it is
fab this is their brow pomade it is this
says beauty brow gel and it's an indie
brand and it's really really inexpensive
the packaging on the outside of it is
kind of cheap like the plastic packaging
is kind of like but this packaging is
done I mean it's just straight glass
with the lid it's just the same as any
other high-end brand how quality is just
as good as any high-end brand I've had
it for that's about your so I don't know

keep a microfiber towel here how'd you
cassette right alright another brand
that I really really love that I only
brought out two of their I talked about
this multiple times but naked Cosmetics
system
it's really really pricey Navy cosmetics
is really good for their single loose
shadows using the iridescent of the
iridescent ones all swaps just use two
for you they're really good
sometimes I'll put on the glitter glue
with these but sometimes I won't I guess
it just kind of depends on they're
pricey though for a stack I think it's
like 40 bucks or something 50 bucks for
a stack repeating about like a single
eyeshadow in Friday's I've how much of a
cost
it's kind of what is similar to like a
pop like a wouldn't you get a pallet you
know but they're the single oh
everybody's saying what was the brand on
the on the brow products miss adore Oh
mi SS ad Oh R Oh miss adore Oh as the
name of the brow product right there
really we're done just watch the other
Navy cosmetics one this is my most
recent purchase was the iridescent one
these are willing mice toppers too so
you can put on like a whole eye look and
then just add that little punch of
iridescent which is really nice
but this the the the regular ones are
are not toppers like the ones that
aren't iridescent excuse me the ones
that aren't iridescent stack those are
not toppers those are just straight
eyeshadows they're straight pigments
that's why they're navy cosmetic cuz
they don't use a lot of fillers Lauren
says ain't nobody got time for loose
eyeshadow Jen I do some people do this
a lot of people do but you know we'll
move on well you know I got more loose
eyeshadows I want to talk about so I'm
sorry
apologize look I went I swore I have
more oh boy would I tell you no Julie
says I wish there reason we priced I've
never worked because they're so
expensive I feel I totally get it I
totally got any one reason why I got
these was because it was an impulse buy
Inez and I did pay full price for them
Monforte wanting love Beauty says Etsy

geek chic cosmetic

geeky stuff
these are really fun so this was from
their Harry Potter collection this is
the shade mischief managed and it's like
a nude shade with a bunch of glitter in
it what I love about these is they're so
I'm hoping I'll be able to get a good
splotchy
it actually looks a lot with the naked
cosmetics that I just did
Ivana wants to know if I tried to make
up monsters liquid lipsticks I have not
pulled the plug on making monsters yet I
haven't gotten on yet haven't done it
nicole says from the air nina call hello
my friend loose blush is in the
boxycharm that just came is really nice
I have more patience for loose blush
than shadow although once in a while
reach for these pigments good to know I
haven't tried it yet this is from the
supernatural collection this is called
angel of Thursday and this is just like
a muted grey with some silver glitter in
it I finally need glitter and it's just
unique
I just don't own anything like that and
then I'm gonna show you just two more
from from them this is from The Hunger
Games collection this is called
Mockingjay I also have one that's
gorgeous from the almost a game of
Thrones but that's not right
not even close The Hobbit what'd you
call it there you go
so this is Mockingjay really fine-tuned
Deen
paint coin it says I'm too messy for
these powders on area it does take a
little more thought and care use a loose
powder like you have you can't just like
flop around in it you've got to be
careful but anyway yeah it's called gold
something gold one ring to rule them all
The Hobbit I'm talking about oh my gosh
Lord O Lord of the Rings I'm setting one
flies Lord of the Rings Lord of the
Rings oh the Lord of the Flies oh my
gosh okay but anyway I have a really
beautiful gold that they did from their
Lord of the Rings collection alright
this one I love this is called luck
dragon and it was it's a single player
shadow now which means that they don't
have the whole collection Morningstar a
few of the most popular shadows this
from never a new story collection this
is one my favorite loose eyeshadows ever
look you can see the gloriousness that
is luckdragon oh my gosh oh my gosh I
can't even with that shade can't even
look at it in the pan can you see it in
the pan hopefully you can see it I'll
bring it up really close oh my gosh geek
chic amazing by the way I have a bunch
of stuff coming from glamour dolls
makeup I bought there on the Lisa Frank
collection was super trap money so
hopefully they'll be finished with that
soon because I'm excited about that this
is a different brand though this is
called glamour doll eyes and they remind
me a lot of the heat sheath but without
the geek beanies
they're adult eyes is another really
good one as far as the quality I'll just
watch this one for you real quick
but look and you can see the punch
shadows I love but yeah each Macky cheap
this is a glamour doll is another band
they have a subscription box that they
used to send me a long time ago and then
I had to stop doing it so I haven't
talked about much sense but this is a
shade called crystal ball really really
nice another great loose shadow brand
each sheet is very creative I agree yeah
so anyway let's move on to this right
here this is a little bit different this
is the Infinity palette by Linda
Hallberg and this is another thing that
Nancy was kind enough to send me she
also sent me some of their brushes which
were good they won't think they were
worth the price that she paid for them
but they're good and I do use them but
this is a really nice palette this is
really good
it's very makeup artist II I feel like
this would be really good for a makeup
artist but I still use it like I don't
use like these two shades at all just
because they're not shades that I know
how to use correctly Sasha says artist
Couture is that in me Sasha sahaja hello
my friend our artist guitar is in the I
do own some of his
laters I find them to be a little too
gloomy for me but if you like when you
believe what you don't like it
the last empowers very good but this is
really good
the LH cosmetics I just got distracted
for a second but but yes and this is
really really good as well it is a
little bit pricey but the quality is
excellent
so Tim yes on this this is a yes yes
Nancy I know I'm so lucky to have a
Nancy I love her to death
mama Sharma says which brand had those
naughty highlighters and lipsticks I
can't remember
Harris has Lisa Frank my heart be still
seriously oh my gosh girlfriend you got

get a lot of PR no I don't and that's
okay I'm cool with God I have a Nancy
and I'm super chat so it's all good I'm
good solid I have a Nancy and I have a
super chat so it's all good Paul says
love don't do you acting like to act
about to uh sorry I had a bath thought
for a second because I love that song
okay so be is just came in my mailbox uh
Nancy she's amazing this is pinky rose
cosmetics I've literally just opened the
box with you so I have not even swatch
these these are called transition
palettes aren't these cool and this is
the luscious plum palette and these are
very inexpensive I think there was like
$22 something like that for this and
you're not beautiful so you've got a day
looking at night look and that's why
they're called the transition caller
you're supposed to be able to transition
from day to night I don't really see how
this is day and this is night I don't
really see too much difference there as
far as this goes
Aston wants to know when super Chad will
be back I'm not quite ready not quite
ready I want to I want to get out some
reviews first and
I'm good for right now so I don't want
to open up the super chat when I'm not
ready to actually purchase anything so
it might actually get pushed off into
winter until like closer to like
December January I did say fall but I
only want to open up super chat when I'm
like ready to invest money from the
super chat so who is Nancy Nancy is one
of my she started off as a subscriber
and now she's a friend of mine we trade
emails back and forth and she sends me
things sometimes for review which is
awesome so anyway so this is the this is
a cardboard packaging and it's got these
beautiful shades let me swatch a little
bit feels very soft this blue that Matt
feels really soft they don't feel the
the foiled ones don't feel very spoiled
they feel a little bit more flat let's
see if I can find some space here that's
not whoo swatches don't mean everything
I haven't tried on the eyes yet that's
kind of a little sample of swatches
Gabrielle wants to tells me I have to
try Feather River body I guess I do I'm
guessing so that's kind of cool I'm
excited to try this on the eyes I
haven't tried it yet like I said Kelly
says anyone tried anything from pink
dust cosmetics I know I have it you know
amber I am so lucky I'm so lucky you
know she's such a wonderful person
you shoot me or she oh there's Nancy buy
me oh my friend ohyes is here okay this
is the second one she said this one is
called the sunflower palette wait to see
this one you ready for this a low
subculture for $22 alright let's watch a
little bit of this baby I haven't
watched this at all - this seems really
nice
we definitely do not have the same
pigmentation a subculture I'll tell you
that definitely a much lighter
pigmentation so what doesn't have to try
that because I'm a little nervous that
the pigmentation is weak but it could be
buildable again swatches only give you
so much information the eye I'm still on
team swatches to mean something I know
I'm in the minority at this point if
like the thing right now to say swatches
don't mean anything but I don't agree I
feel like you can get a lot of
information from swatches but they're
just a base of information they were
jumping off point for information you
definitely need to try them on the eye
as well but I do believe swatches are
helpful and important pinky rose
cosmetics on the lookin scene there's a
website on here yes pinky Rose cosmetics
calm this is the outer packaging mother
and then she also sent these lipsticks
these aren't from a brand called color
the world and this says of natural
lipsticks these are hand poured
lipsticks not pretty I love the
packaging it's a cardboard package and
kind of like the Tarte lipsticks that
they were doing for a while miss if I
can they feel creamy and they seem like
they're buildable I'm gonna try one on
even though I know it's gonna look
absolutely ridiculous with no makeup on
gee and oh and see what they say on the
bottom you slip they can okay here we go
yes G and O is the name of the shade and
then this one's called dreamer let's see
if I can find a shade that won't look
crazy on me right now I know there's a
neutral shade in there I think this one
right here this one is called kisses
we're gonna try this one
Norma the mirror here we go something a
little more natural so it looks a little
worried alright mother's here
whoo I like that not catching all shear
a little it'll ring right there okay the
ring is gone I think that was just
application error but it's definitely
shear and it's hydrating very hydrating
very moisturizing not patching very nice
I like that some people really like more
sure-shot lipsticks than people like
super opaque I'm more of a sheer I'm
more of a sheer kind of person so that's
kind of way up my alley I'm going to
keep your eye on it looks that bad as
far as like the no makeup look this
brand is called color the world so I've
got quite a few care to try there the
packaging is so cool so this one is
called
foxy foxy lady they all seem to be a
little bit sheer rachel says girl I'm
gonna go broke after watching this to
the end you just started picking shoes
man I pick a cheese and what you do to
set up your cart you put everything you
