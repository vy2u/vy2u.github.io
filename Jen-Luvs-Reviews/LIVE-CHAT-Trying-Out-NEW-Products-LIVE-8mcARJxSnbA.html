the makeup chat so happy to be here with
you guys this morning I've been thinking
about you guys for the past couple days

to chat what am I gonna chat about and I
was like a lot of products that I've
never shown on the channel things that
are brand new to me things that I just
haven't a chance to talk about I was
like why don't we have a chat just like
hanging out like girlfriends you know
like you know me your girlfriends get
together and you know when you were
maybe a teenager and everybody played
with each other's makeup and you spend a
lot of fun well we can't play with each
other's makeup but I can play with my
makeup and you can tell me what you want
to see so that you can see how it
applies and I thought it would become
fun just like let you all need and I do
my makeup and you guys tell me what you
think you want to see so i can show you
what I've got and then in the collective
brain of makeup awesomeness aka the chat
window that I can see over here then
everybody will tell me what you want to
see apply it and we'll play with it and
we'll talk about it also will tap into
the collective brain and hear about your
experiences with products that you have
tried if you're watching this on the
replay definitely type some experiences
of some new products that you've been
trying recently down in the comments
below so we can all learn from you this

about good products and also bad
products so we don't waste our money so

my goodness so many fun people that I
absolutely love lilies here and yet lots
of four summers hi KJ coffee taste my
coffee tastes better and my peril of
smug too funny all right so let's go
ahead and talk about some of the
products that I've gotten recently one
thing I wanted to show you is I got this
cool little Josie Maran set mehran Moran
I got this set at the Sephora sale on
sale I ordered this online and show you
the things like that of course we're not
going to use all these things because
like this is a cleansing oil and then
this is the Oregon milk which I'm
excited to try and of course the
original argan oil so I'm excited about
fat and then this I was saying about we
might want to try today this is the ARCA
daily moisturizer protect and perfect I
haven't used this yet so I thought that
might be fun to try first Oh another
option that we could try would be the
oprah silicone primer gel I've never
tried this on camera I'm getting ready
to do a brand review for over so I've
tried all these things but I've never
tried them on camera so i thought i
would show you that Samantha says I the
coconut water I show her the applicator
broke off so sad oh no that is um let me
see is there any other okay that's
pretty much it for like primary kinds of
things so it means this you can use this
what do you guys think should we do the
josie maran type in JM if you think
actually use the josie maran or trypan
Oh ofra if you think I should use the
ofra and we'll decide then what you guys
think protect and perfect everybody's
time at the protectant perfect so far
I've got two votes for this one I'm
having to view and chat via my phone I
covered in dog and can't get up I'm glad
you're able to are a lot of great things
about the ofra one two three it looks
like mostly that josie maran is winning
the over its called a silicone primer
gel but you know what's really weird
about it the very last ingredient is
silicone that weird it looks like most
people want to see the josie maran I
don't know it's splitting now it's going
back and forth now oh goodness okay let
me go back up let's vote it's like
splitting first it looked like it was
all josie maran but now it's a lot of it
one two three hey Nikki can you help me
count the Oh froze I'm gonna kill
account the Josie mehran's 123456789
this might not be functional pick 10 11
12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32
nikki says suggesting around his thick
she hasn't yuck it's like sunscreen oh
no and Jenny's like Jesse brown breaks
me out all right do half and half well
this one I think has coverage let's just
play let's just play you know what I
might do let's put a little bit over on
and I'll show you what this looks like
now it's called a silicone primer gel
and it looks like a gel but then like
when you pat it on it like feels like
water like it completely disappears and
it just feels like water it doesn't feel
like silicone at all like at all it just
seeps right in like I can feel it still
wet a little bit I'm looking at myself
in the mirror in the monitor now like
the the window put a little bit setting
get any on my forehead and then we'll
play with the josie maran after I don't
think the voting thing is gonna work cuz
I can't count and I'll take me too long
to count everything and I don't know
waste your time so it's already
completely seeped into my face like it's
like super fast absorbing like really
fast I'm hoping it's got good stuff in
it because it totally just went into my
face I mean it's got me see the
ingredients it's got um deionized water
is the first ingredient and then ginkgo
biloba extract is the second ingredient
and then sorbitol and then echinacea
purpurea River river purrpurr yeah then
site sodium high higher on eight Tyler
on eight highly Iran eight so I mean
it's got some good stuff in it I mean I
recognize a couple of those ingredients
as being a good thing so excited about
that let's go ahead and try this so I've
just pumped a ridiculous amount onto my
hand you can see how it's dripping down
so it is quite watery let's see what
happens here and I'm just gonna spread
this with my fingers instead of a brush
because it is supposed to be more like a
primer oh it feels thick Nikki was
totally right it feels thick
all right I think that's enough I'm
going to get a white toilet all the rest
and that B's Dickinson which miracle
wipes i really like these a lot i got
these like in an influencer box in the
summertime and i'm like i like them i
still have some left can't believe
myself some left all right and make sure
my witch hazels off my hands here it
definitely feels I'm not it feels smooth
or I feel like it's evening my skin tone
a bit and I know I'm not padding
probably the way I'm supposed to Pat are
you I get bored padding and padding and
padding padding but I feel like it even
my skin tone a boat it doesn't feel bad
it feels kind of oily you know it's got
argan oil and it feels like it has argan
oil in it totally feels like it has
argan oil in but it feels nice let me
get my mirror out I should have put it
on half my face so we could see the
difference will do that from now on
we'll do half the face from now on my
face is definitely so you can see you
look it's you forever and ever and ever
um I can definitely still feel it on my
skin it feels like I have moisturizer on
um it's a tinted moisturizer is what it
comes down to it doesn't have a funky
smell I would think that might have a
funky smell but it doesn't let it go Oh
Austin do with it oh it's right here um
yeah there's no funky smell which I'm
surprised it is SPF 47 um and it feels
like it's still sitting on my skin like
I can still feel it it feels like a
heavy moisturizer so there you go first
impression I think it looks nice KJ I
would imagine anybody with dry skin
would really like this i just clicked
over to the collective brain nikki says
it has an orange tint i think though on
my hand we squirt put a little bit out
on my hand again and it definitely has
a warmer attempt to it I agree Nicki
definitely has a warmer tent thank you
for bringing that up she likes the Oort
argan oil by itself um I think it looks
good too Krishna says now one two three
watch and I feel like the most we've had
oh um a 123 watching yeah maybe it might
be the collective brain is growing which
is good because then we have more people
to learn from more experiences this
happens here which is awesome okay it
took me a second understand Chris
because it was one two three but I get
it now it took me a minute so I really
like the way that it looks I'm pretty
happy with it Kaylee says maybe it will
absorb more on change color I tried it
once and it was white and turn to color
I think that's a different product
Kaylee I think I know which one you're
talking about the one that's white
insurance color from josie maran I think
that's a different one alright so let's
move on from there but I'm excited about
that and let's let's talk about like a
foundation he kind of thing so we've got
some different choices of things we can
do we can go back into the physicians
formula I did try this again on
periscope and I patted it and it did
look quite different than when I wiped
it so yes and then I love you Lilly
Spivey spit Spivey I'm gonna say Spivey
it looks like spirals me and then we
also have some Oh for a foundation we
have some / BB cream mm-hmm and we have
we have make up for ever HD I've never
used this this is the only thing I've
never used the make up for ever all 28
ultra HD and this is in the shade I
don't know it says why 375 on the bottom
but I don't think that's it i don't know
but i've never tried this um make sure
that the same thing yes so I don't know
I don't know which one to try the / BB
cream the over foundation and make it
forever Ultra HD or the physicians
formula makeup forever a lot of people
are saying they make it forever so far
um I hear a lot of things about to make
up for ever too but I've never used it
so it looks like early votes go for
makeup
forever every SPF fake breaks you out
Boston Barbie doll oh no all right let's
do make up for ever ok so I've never
used this before I'm hoping that it's
the right shade and if it's not we'll
just go with it anyway I'll wash my face
later all right hmm we shall see hmm you
think so makeup check she says that the
physicians formula looks better when you
use the brush that day Yesenia says and
make up for ever as nice yesenia i was
with you sending out a generation beauty
yesenia was smarting off to wait in line
and make it forever line and get the
free makeup forever foundation oh my
gosh I did I didn't but then i end up
with a stress fracture in my foot so
it's probably better that i didn't wait
in line alright i'm clicking away from
the collective brain for a second and i
am applying this this is very yellow on
me very yellow I'm neutrally skin tone
so I can kind of handle it but this is
very yellow on me this is probably not
the right shade but we're just going to
go with it and if I have to wash my
makeup off later I will I just want to
test the formula right where my brushes
okay you use will use my Marc Jacobs
brush this is the face to I don't
usually use this one on camera so we use
this one and then put on a lot because
I'm scared of this yellow I should have
just put it on half I said I was gonna
just put on half and do that let's see
if we can see the difference between the
two halves I know I have big blotches on
my face but I can definitely tell a
difference let's get real close that
looks beautiful that looks really pretty
I really like that a lot all right well
blending blotches out but it definitely
blended into my skin I'm surprised so I
saw that yellow and about freaked out
all the glue this brush is really really
soft it's really nice i wish it was not
so pricey it was like my
large blob brush when I went out with my
friend Sandra Sandra loves makeup here
in the collective brain we went out
shopping and I splurged on this I like
the way that looks I like that a lot I
may have to invest in a full size of
this but probably a different shade I
think it looks really good yes well back
it up a little bit you definitely see
the yellow undertone when I back it up
but I think it looks nice I think it
looks nice i'm going to click over the
collective brain and see what y'all
think all right a lot of people are
saying they really like it um Caroline
says it actually looks super nice as it
blends Boston Barbie doll says yes I
want 50 or higher I don't know what you
talking about that's okay you're
probably talk about something that has
something to do with something else set
Kristin says she thinks it blended
nicely Christmases I really hated the
make up for ever stick foundation she
has combo skin Krista says is a little
yellow but not so much that you have to
wash your face and put on something else
that's the way that I kind of feel about
it right now Krista tired mom says very
nice blending Sammy coverage is nice dan
says it gives you a slight tan but it
looks good thank you so much my friend
Monica says you look nice and summery
thank you and lisa says it looks good
full coverage I don't know let me look
at my freckles um my freckles are
definitely for the most part covered I
would say right now I have medium
coverage but you saw how little I put on
I put the entire little bit on I am
shredded this can build a full coverage
if i were with it too I'm start
buildable coverage so I don't think I'm
gonna build in a fool but I really like
it a lot um yeah SPF SPF without the SPF
what is this about the editor I know my
son date my primer had SPF in it so he
brought me a saline gonna let me take a
very facile enid on that story so I'm
smile cupcake my brother when he first
saw the Wizards of Waverly Place he
called me on the phone and was like oh
my gosh this girl looks just like you
just soup girl she's like his little you
George just like you and I was leaving a
mess like what now she's all famous and
everything
like super famous oh it froze hit
refresh refresh refresh Christmas as I
should buy the full size she likes it on
me I'm thinking about it now it's
lagging if it's lagging just hit refresh
it should be fine um alright let's go
ahead and move on from here we're 18
minutes in we're only we gotta keep
going so I've been on this kick lately
of not applying any powder until
finishing powder at the end and I really
like it so we're gonna skip the power
for bed and I want to show you some of
the actually no eyeshadow primer Oh can
see where this concealer is brand new to
me it's the amazing cosmetics amazing
concealer I thought that I would use
this today because this is the only new
concealer that I have even though i'm
thinking makeup chick says she's loving
the color thank you i know i'm getting
destructed um I you know what's funny as
I when I first started going to sephora
i remember going to sephora and asking
for this and they were like no we do not
sell that brand and i had no idea so
i've never tried this and I've always
want to try it I don't feel like I
really need a lot of concealer today
because this foundation just seemed to
cover everything but we're gonna try it
anyway just for fun cuz you know we're
trying on makeup today and that's what
we do cuz it's fun whoa it's all watery
and separated mm-hmm where's my boy mmm
how long have I had this I don't think
I've had it very long there we go now
it's better okay so this will be kind of
like a brightening because this is in
the shade fair which is a little light
for me but I don't need any real
concealing today which I'm surprised
because I was up to like two in the
morning last night so I'm surprised
we're going to do a good ol finger
blending because I feel like it does
better oh that's definitely brightening
it's definitely would you like holy moly
I look like one of those crazy girls not
crazy girls but you know time I think
the girls that do the crazy highlighting
and then they come out looking gorgeous
at the ends that's what it looks like
I'm gonna bring it down Wow holy moly
what is what is that
roars wait at all whatever it is not is
it that crazy contouring business what
is happening here bah oh my gosh what in
the world just exploded all over my
under eye uh-huh well we're gonna go for
crazy contouring today apparently oh my
gosh well now I know do not apply that
much uh that's insane I look like a
weirdo what is that I gotta like wipe a
little bit of that off that's just crazy
I'm gonna look and think the collective
brain has any advice for me at this
point their first panda look I know
apparently a little does go a long way
my friend ms wendy apparently alright so
now i can bake I know right alright
let's see if we can get a little bit of
this calm down no highlighter needed I
know right I know I'm rubbing my under
eyes i'm sorry i'm really not pulling
that hard I swear playing with a brush
okay let's do that okay oh my gosh it's
freaking me out because I don't normally
do this stuff okay you're going to blend
with a brush alright this is my my outer
beauty take tapered refiner is what this
is called that was a good idea to blend
with a brush that was a very good idea
that's starting to look not so crazy it
went way too low though all right it's
definitely working less crazy now all
right whoa okay let's move on romarin
let's just keep going and see what
happens alright for eyebrows today I've
never used this twisty crayon on line up
camera I got this in a subscription box
maybe maybe generation beauty swag bag
but it's got this is it's one of those
like Tris teeth they all have look like
you've liked open your cap and you're
going to get a mess everywhere but it's
like one of these things like the new
anastacio format and their stodgy as
making a brow crayon thinking like
and then on the back I don't know if
there's are the back though it has a
brow gel which is super cool so we're
going to do that today because that's
the only brow product that i have that's
pretty new so we're going to go ahead
and do that and we have to meet my
mirror out i'm going to switch up switch
over the collective brain for a second
make sure i'm not missing anything and
dad says at least I like a big um is it
sinking into fine lines not as of now
but we'll see so far not as of now
anastacio brow Perfector Thank You
Christa it was in the show today I
couldn't think of what it was called all
right let's go ahead and do browse a lot
of people asked me recently how to do
browse and what I do is I just follow
that natural line on my brow hmm and I
just fill it in I don't go outside my
brow line and when my eyebrows stops
that's when I stopped because I have
eyebrows that go to the right spot you
know I mean because he say they're
supposed to do like the line here and
that's where your eyebrows supposed to
stop but I definitely benefit from
filling my brows in there we go so it's
looking pretty good I really like this
tristique crayon thingy it's not too um
is not too creamy which I really really
like um and it got cigs right down to
the skin it's a neutral topi kind of
color so I can work with it it's not
like a um you know it's not too light
and it's not too dark it's just with a
neutral which is perfect for eyebrows at
least my eyebrows alright so there's
that I feel like my this eyebrow is
darker than the other eyebrow and I need
to get my brows done bad like a mr.
space whoop sorry like looking at you
looking at me looking at you again
you
you
oh man come on okay all right are we
back think we might be back okay come on
Tabitha text me back right back okay all
right at least I kept me at least you
can hear me okay on I met try try going
back and go back out and come back ok
I'm back alright cool whoo I don't know
what happened my whole my whole thing
just crashed and it said had that little
like creepy like scary you know your app
crash thing I know I don't know what
happened ok alright cool alright well
we're just gonna keep going I'm glad you
can see me all right I'm so happy you're
here Kelly happy that it's your first
time here I'm so sorry so sorry for the
technical difficulties silly YouTube we
just lost like 20 people come on youtube
or go all right well we're back and I'm
gonna go ahead and keep going since
we're back my whole thing just froze up
out of nowhere all right we're gonna
apply the brown side here it's a little
bit light for my hair color but I just
go with it you know it is what it is as
far as getting her brows even I saw
someone asked about getting your brows
even you just have to go back and forth
until they're even and that is
definitely not even what I just did I
don't know what that was that I just did
it looks a hot mess so we're just um
slowly to your friend to every woman
doing her brows needs to have a spoolie
boys are sec so where's my schooling I
just found one
around make sure I don't miss it but
spool ease are super super super
important because it evens out the
product and wherever it's comfy you can
even it out and it look so much better
all right when we're not perfect today
for brows but we're not going to be
perfect cuz they need to get my brows
done so it's close enough no Instagram
perfection here that just doesn't happen
period with me effort by the way do you
see I got my hair redone it's like a
dark pink I really like it a lot all
right sip of coffee get me through that
because that was some craziness and it's
1030 I need to give my eyeshadow primer
yep okay so we have a couple of choices
for eyeshadow primer I have the overage
l I gel primer and then I have Urban
Decay's Eden and I have Urban Decay's my
nurse in I'm going to go ahead and flip
over to collective brain and see what
you guys think about what is happening
and what I should do um give it up for
spoolie is Roxanne says yes all right
that's true I was like um tired mom says
symmetry is normal in nature yes ofra
everybody sing ofra interesting you
can't see the hair car cuz the
Lighting's too dark it's not as light as
it was though my nurse in Eden 040 freh
seeing a lot of Oprah that's interesting
Oh Teresa I'm so glad that you're here
I'm glad you love all things what's up
in makeup that makes me happy oh you
can't see my eyes is there something
wrong here what's going on here me flip
back over you should be able to it is
dark you're right so I can show it
closed
not gonna be broken up anymore sorry for
the lack of YouTube functionality today
I'm not taking the blame on this one so
there's no opacity to it at all it feels
like the Urban Decay primer potion and
the Too Faced shadow insurance I wonder
what the ingredients how similar they
are because it feels exactly same it's a
little bit on the earlier side so if you
need hydrating this is probably going to
be good for you if you have oily skin
you probably will not like this is more
on the hydrating side just so you know
but it feels good I am normal skin so I
can kind of go either way but definitely
more for drier skin than oily skin all
right now for eyeshadow we have a few
different choices now I've gotten these
babies whoa I got the not just news the
Revlon Colorstay not just nudes I have
the number two romantic nudes and the
number one passionate news i also have
an 0 for eyeshadow count that we can
play with it looks like this but then
this is it for a full look for me
there's no light colors in here and then
they also have this one by skyn Iceland
not skin I oh that's a lip palette you
tell how much I've gone anything all
right to look how it went on doing that
all right I just pulled out I was a call
another I shall
pallet but it's not all right so I'm
thinking we should probably do the Rev
want one of the revlon pilots but I
don't know which one one or two what do
you think this is the one and then this
is the two which one you guys most
interested in seeing one or two to the
ofra interesting froze in go out and
come back romantic nudes ofra or ofra
22222 everybody saying to all right
let's do too all right a couple of ones
mostly tues okay and what use a little
bit of the 0 for 2 ok so I'm going to go
ahead and start off with this shade down
here and they don't have names or
anything like a typical drug store felt
there's no names nanny says ofra makes
products for other companies still I
didn't know that that's interesting all
right so we're going to go ahead down
here in his cream shade and we're going
to pop that all over the lid and you can
see it's not really showing up super
well it's okay it's like super not
opaque but it's working I mean it's
working it's just not awesome you see if
i can get this little lighting a little
bit better let me get it writer i don't
know i don't know if that's any better
or not or if it's blowing it out okay
put a little bit more
okay let me show you a swatch just so
you can see what we're working with here
I mean it might just be really close to
my skin tone that might be part of it
okay let's look at the oprah and let's
see if there's any shades in here we use
this one of being movies we're going to
use that one over one up in the crease
it's very similar to this one and the
red one pallet here they will do one on
each side if they're close enough now
they're not close enough this is the
Revlon and this is the Oprah so we're
going to use the Oprah alright alright
so I'm going to start in my outer corner
and I'm just going to work my way up and
it's super super pigmented so this is
the only going to need to be blended out
definitely now a lot of people ask me
the point of a transition color and the
point is is that you want your eyes to
pop so a transition color will give you
a shadow in your crease so that your
eyes pop more it'll also help you
transition from shade the shade alright
so that's not going to stay like that
don't worry not going to stay like that
it's just like that for now but that
went on very very easily very easily now
we're going to put that aside and we're
gonna go back into this all right let me
go back over I feel funny not being able
to see there we go now i can see you
guys too all right tara says the new
Milani pallets are awesome one reminds
her of the kat von d monarch palette
cool all right go ahead and for morning
let's do I want to do I like this
reddish shade I want to put that up in
my crease or maybe i'll use the purple I
don't know most so many decisions i'm
going to use the radish shade so i think
i use a purple last time i use this yeah
I've to use my mirror because I don't
want to mess this up it's wrong camera
girlfriend we can't mess it up I don't
know it's kind of hard to see you guys
see that even feel like it's not showing
up very well everybody in the collective
brain of some and how awesome makeup
revolution is I'm feeling like this
palette is not awesome like it's just
it's just weak in pigmentation when you
apply it to the I um I can't see the
color I can't see the color and I can't
build it like in the swatch like you can
see in the swatch it's totally there but
I can't build it okay he just says yeah
I left drugstore palettes alone a long
time ago I don't think you're the only
longer right all right so um where do I
go from here I feel like no matter what
I do I'm going to get a super neutral
natural look that really wasn't what I
was going for today I guess these shades
are all kind of neutral and natural
anyway let's go ahead and less hmm I'm
feeling like I want to use a little bit
of makeup geeks mood ring because this
is a fun color and I just want your
phone on my eyes so we're gonna do a
little bit I don't have any way to
dampen it right now and I'm not trying
to put wet in my drugstore shadows I'm
scared I'm gonna ruin them but thank you
for the idea I know a lot of people say
to wet the brush I would get scared to
do that that's just me but I want to try
vests now all right I'm going to use my
finger for this this is really difficult
to I don't like the sifter on this I
wish they would just get the regular
sifters like everybody else you know
what I mean they work there's no reason
to use crazy sifters that I can see and
less for some reason they just the
product doesn't come out of the holes I
don't know but I feel like we really
need regular everyday lots of holes
little sisters in these Marlena makeup
geek who doesn't watch my channel but it
should happens to stumble across this
all right I don't know if we can even
see this see if I can get see it's like
you can't you can't even see it as this
camera is not good enough I can see it
shimmering can you guys see that glow on
that side it's definitely glowy I don't
know if you can see it but it's
definitely glowy compared to the other
side you see the shine but I'm not
trying to put something crazy all over
my lids either hopefully you can see the
glow because there's definitely glow
happening I like playing with makeup
with you this is fun okay but you can't
really see I mean I don't know if you
can even see the duochrome in it they
say if you can see here let me pull this
away because I think this is messing it
up see if I can feel like half of this
episode is me just trying to make sure
you can see things it definitely looks
better than the the drugstore pal
drugstore palette was not working for me
not working but I think that with the
drugstore palette I feel like if you're
going for like super neutral looks you
might like the drugstore palette I don't
know I can't speak to wear time though
let me uh blend out
let's use this one it's got a really
it's got a nice shade range though I'm
going to use this one I'll like to blend
out up here at the top make sure I have
a clean brush this one right here just
to blend this out a little bit of a
stiff line there and I do not like that
look of the stiff line sometimes I see
on Instagram people that have that stiff
flying up here and it looks good on them
but I don't like the way it looks on me
I like to blend it out so we ended up
with the neutral I look anyway and it's
okay we're just gonna go with it we're
just having fun you know it's all about
having fun makeup suppose we have any
fun and I feel like there's so much
pressure here on YouTube everybody to be
perfect and amazing and awesome I just
have fun you know I'm having a good time
I'm having a good time all right let me
go ahead and minimize this a little bit
so I can see you guys um let's see you
see there's anything in the collective
brain happening that I need to read yes
stephanie says sometimes you don't
always want a super highly pigmented
shadow for every day as long as they
played nicely totally agree probably
with you on that one well said well said
Tara says she can't wait for the pitch
palette and I'm with you so we're just
going to do with this a very simple
boring kind of well alright so I got
some of these color pop eyeliners I
thought maybe would play with one of
those today and we have a neutral look
so we can play with one I have a dark
green a bright blue gray a purple and a
gold all right what color should i use
what do you think I've got a very
neutral look so I can do whatever I want
what do you guys think collective brain
help me out anybody watching anymore did
I lose you guys the blue okay steph says
the blue Jillian says the dark green
purple green golden gray folder gray
blue purple purple purple purple green
blue purple purple purple grey green
that's a good idea down
purple purple green blue purple / a lot
of purple alright so let's go ahead and
go with the purple um I will show you
the blue I will show you the blue though
the Blues pretty amazing this thing I
can even get my finger in there this
it's insane right great rate I'll be fun
and summer you're not fun with that this
stuff drives so fast oh my gosh now I
get along its Gray's greens and golds
man no up sad I thought about doing what
you guys want me to do purple with a bit
of golden on top that's a good idea you
know what I might do i just made a huge
mess all over my hands goodness artist
palette change my mind blue that's funny
i think i'm gonna do we'll do a little
bit gold and then we'll put the blue
over top how about that we only have 15
minutes left can you believe it you know
hurry up all right get my liner out my
liner brush should have got my brushes
out ahead of time hindsight's 2020
alright we're going to use this one from
targets on my favorite I have another
tort one that I like better than this
but we're going to go with the gold this
one is called dirty talk I'm having
trouble getting it's a pickup product
but it's getting there it's just taking
some work I'm just smashing it in and
then spinning it hopefully hopefully
that is not showing up at all
come on come on okay I'm going to wipe
it in instead instead of spinning it see
what happens hmm that's interesting not
sure if it matches with my eyes but
that's okay we're going to go with it
you see that interesting and the wiping
swiping worked much better than the
rolling just so you know the swiping in
the product all right I'm all like
Octopussy right now my arms are all like
twisted around and it's definitely
getting in my lashes if I get too close
straight up getting in my lashes that's
okay you see we can see it's looking
okay though we're going to try the
purple next I'm gonna put the purple
right on top I made it a little bit
thick so it could be like layered and
who knows whether this is going to come
out good or not I have no idea cuz it's
all about having fun all right I lost my
purple I put it aside and I don't often
oh my gosh this is my life this is my
life with me Stephanie's funny says
sometimes make up names makeup companies
try to come up with provocative names
regardless of the color totally agree
this one is called no shame all right
they're gonna be so fun to watch other
youtubers do this it was super easy i'm
not going to do a wing today because i'm
not going to brave it but i really like
the way that looks when I'm super super
creamy oh okay megan i will i'll take a
good picture of it and put it on
Instagram I will do that I'm blurry and
out of focus oh my gosh this YouTube
chat thing is not met for this format
and it's funny because I just got a new
webcam that's supposed to be 1080p Oh
octopus again I don't think YouTube has
caught up with how awesome we are that's
what happened here alright and show you
where we're going here what is happening
why you know my lording that can focus
that's good let's try to do a wig just
for the fun of it I'm just gonna look in
the monitor looks pretty good there we
go yeah look at it in the mirror and see
if it really does look all right it does
look all right yeah okay looking good
look good all right hi nikka nikka nikka
yes okay I'm like it I'm liking it all
right now this is a very exciting one
I'm very excited about this I just got
this in the mail yesterday this is the
tinted benefit they're real tinted
eyelash and I read the directions on
here and there's nothing fancy that it
says you're supposed to do with it so
I'm super excited so we're going to go
ahead and
try this it looks like this but it's
like super Wiggly like it's supposed to
move with your eyelashes but it is
rubber bristles and it's got the pokies
on the end there so we're gonna see how
this goes hello Ann Marie dance funny he
says I should I even repeat that it does
imagine telling your family that you're
wearing orgasm or deepthroat it sounds
like an awkward conversation yeah yeah I
hear you I hear you alright so let's go
ahead and try this all right here we go
at least she'll be able to hopefully
you'll be able to see this a little bit
this is my first time using this
supposedly it makes your eyelashes long
and soft all right you can't see
anything let me say I'm gonna see if I
can move this you can't really see
anything mmm that eyeliners messing it
up too because you can't see cuz the
eyeliner oh so frustrating so
frustrating Lisa my under-eye concealer
doesn't look so weird anymore all right
let's try this again just going to do
the 1i now I can just tell you what I
can see and I can see that it has turned
my lashes brown and it has volumize them
a little bit in that I look like I have
lots of lashes and it is definitely
lengthen so I'm excited to use this I'm
actually very excited like I can see a
good bit of length over here on the side
they look very naturally long looks
really really good really good i am
going to pair the last prime with a
mascara in just a minute hopefully
you'll be able to see it that's my only
issue it does not have fibers I don't
believe it's just a tinted primer it
doesn't look like it has fired I don't
think it does that's a great question
let me see if I can turn turn this way I
don't know if you can see it oh because
I can't see you so I don't know if you
can see it oh it's terrible it's
lighting you say very good clothes oh my
god it's so setting I want you to be
able to see it okay could you see it a
little bit I hope so okay cool all right
we're gonna put on the other eye it
definitely looks good though you got
trust me it looks really good way better
than I expected like benefit is a very
hit-or-miss brand with me I feel like
with benefit that's rare that i find a
product that I'm like yes I'm liking a
by itself to as like an everyday we're
kind of thing and then if you want
something more dramatic you can put a
mascara on top o the profile shot did it
thank you Nani awesome that makes me
happy hopefully maybe you're able to see
because i can't see when I look that
ways I can't see what what you can see
on the watch back on the replay this may
go a little longer than an hour because
I stuff to do my face all right here we
go looking good looking good excited
about it um topping with it I was
thinking about this is pretty new for me
this is the Maybelline the falsies push
up drama I was thinking about putting
that on top because I've never showed
this on camera the only I don't like
about this is look how far spaced out
the bristles are we can see so it
doesn't really come through lashes very
well but it's nice it's a nice mascara
I've heard that it flakes on some people
it does not flake on me so they have a
lot of their real things it's like their
thing is that they're real thing the
blushes are really good by benefit
though I will have to say oh my gosh
this looks so good um and this mascara
can be a little clumpy
but it's really looking good oh my gosh
I'm loving this Wow wait till you see
this no you said the profile thing
worked okay and we'll try the side
that's the no mascara yes I'm excited
excited about this all right the other
side oh my gosh I'm so excited like this
may be a new favorite maybe it just
might be I'm a huge fan of the Lancome
CIL's booster XL and I feel like I'm a
may even like this better because the
Lancome is white which causes issues
sometimes now another thing about
benefit products at least with that
eyeliner was that it aged really really
badly so I definitely don't want to have
a verdict on this until um until I've
used it for a while because I'm scared
oh good I'm glad you could see it oh
thank you monica that's nice Jen she's
at Jen you're so pretty with eye makeup
and without that is so sweet of you the
lashes are insane aren't they that's
crazy and I'm like no lashes look really
really really really really good and
then Samantha says white primers make
her lashes look right yeah me too me too
yet lashes for days Jenny lashes for
days oh no I'm excited about this last
primer oh my gosh so awesome Haley says
the Lancome Souls did not hold her curl
this benefit primer sort of how old her
curled not like the Maybelline full and
soft though interesting on Steph I just
put online where did it go here we go
I just put on this pair this is the
benefit they're real tinted primer and
then the maybelline the falsies push-up
drawn mascara very excited about this
pair sweet okay so now we're going to go
into face and we're going to Humble your
feet your feet freezing go out and come
back so i wanted to do either one of the
east to so either the Maybelline master
contour or the Loreal infallible Pro
contour what do you guys think which one
should i use either way we're probably
going to use this blush and bronzer I
mean this blush and highlight but I
don't know about the contour I know
which one you guys want to see for
contouring l'oreal maybelline korean
Mabley lore'l lore'l lore'l lore'l
maybelline maybelline l'oreal maybelline
l'oreal maybelline back and forth lore'l
lore'l lore'l looks like we got more
L'Oreal's all right let's do l'oreal i'm
gonna start with the contour now this
contour i'll let you know right now that
it is a little bit warm but we're gonna
do it anyway I don't know what you mean
by Korean I don't have a Korean contour
and I'll this I can't do something that
doesn't exist alright we're going to do
the l'oreal contour just you can see
i'll show you how warm it is it's very
very when we move this back over we're
not doing mascara it's very very very
warm and contours in my opinion should
be neutral and this is kind of form but
we're going to go for it anyway so the
trick with contouring a lot of people
ask me about contouring and it took me a
while to get contour because I'm just a
mom man like i don't i don't i'm not
makeup artist but starting at the e.r
and then going aiming like you're
playing pool towards your mouth and then
stop right there you should have the
most product here aim and stop right
there
I've been facing that ballot is
terrifying it is terrifying totally with
you totally with you on that you're so
funny I'm always glad when you're here
alright start the ear down toward the
mail stop at the middle the eye so top
of the ear down for the mouth submittal
the eye it's always better to err on the
side of higher rather than lower in my
opinion because I feel like with lower
you get a beard with higher you get a
bronzer so I'd rather have a bronzer
than a beard okay so we're gonna go
ahead I'm going to wipe the product off
there i'm just going to blend it a
little bit it actually doesn't look too
bad it is warm it is warm um i wish that
it was cooler but it's fine for me I'm
okay with it I'm okay with it alright so
we're gonna let that there I might put
more on in a bit but I don't want to
overdo it I mean I think with contouring
one thing I'm gonna put a little tiny
bit more one thing with contouring is
really important is not to go the
Instagram route if you're a regular
person going out like don't do that to
your face don't do that things that look
good in pictures don't necessarily look
good in real life like I was looking on
Instagram the other day and it was a
girl look absolutely beautiful I was
like man if I ran into her in public I
don't think she looked crazy you know
like that'sthat's like for photos you
know alright compassion and beauty hi
how are you she says agree about
bronzers they should definitely be cool
toned in neutral yeah absolutely because
shadows aren't warm there's no warmth to
a shadow alright we're going to go ahead
and we're gonna do we're gonna do the
blush out of this I just hit you sorry
about that it's eleven o'clock I'm
definitely running over right now but
that's okay we're gonna blush that out I
really like this blush and highlight
like a lot like if you're going to get
this palette don't get it for the
contour shade get it for the blush in
the highlight the blush and highlighter
beautiful my instagram is Jen loves
reviews I love makeup 25 it is too
orange but we're gonna go with it anyway
because we're just playing and having
fun okay
I have to look at it in a real mirror
it's very very bright but since we're on
camera and get you a little closer turn
this down a little bit maybe if it there
we go so you can see like naturally what
is up with my eyeliner right there that
is funky I'm gonna fix that but that's
not cool I don't know what that is but
we're gonna fix that later but it's
really pretty it's a really really
pretty flush Chinese like I love how
you're like a regular person i know i
don't know how people aren't a regular
person I don't get it I don't get out
you I don't know okay is this a sigma
brush for my highlight I really like
this brush this is a taper highlighter
it's a f-35 brush oh my gosh this is
such a nice highlight what you see this
it's so pretty in the song Maybelline
palette so pretty here we go I don't
know if you can see it but oh it's
glowing you can't see it because my
light is being weirdly so I turn this
off I'll turn it back on in a second but
I don't know if you can see see the
shine no yeah there it is there's the
shine here we go you see a poppin I'm a
big I'm thing on the poppy highlights I
like my highlights to glow I like that
Jaclyn hill high light glow but you can
see that shine right there really liked
it a lot I turn this back on and make
sure in the real mirror that I don't
look like the cloud alright I think
we're good I'm definitely way too glowy
for a real life but you've got to get
the point member i still had that argan
oil all over my face i still have to
like powder this up and then kai says
i've never used anything besides over
for a highlight Oh obsess the over
highlights are amazing they're fantastic
christmas says Taji said the highlight
was worth buying the whole California I
will I think blush and the highlight are
worth buying the whole palette for the
contour is a good
if you're okay with it being a bronzer
you'll be happy you'll be absolutely
happy with it um oh that's so awesome
dan I appreciate you so much i love it
when you come by you always bring unique
perspective i love it alright so now
we're going to do this we only it down
to lips I think we're down the lips and
then finish know where to finishing
powder so I was going to use today this
bareMinerals I've never used this on
camera if the bare minerals ready
eliminating touch-up veil I think this
is a deluxe I sample and it comes with a
spongy but I'm not going to use this
bungee i'm going to use a brush favorite
favorite brush for loose powder is the
real techniques blush brush it's amazing
and watch how this mattifies the skin
the stuff is so good and just kind of
brings everything together it does have
a bit of a cent though so just be aware
its got like a um like a cleaning
solution kind of sense like a chemically
cleaning kind of scent you see if you
can see the difference between the sides
I don't know if you can see this goofy
camera all right I don't know if you can
see the difference i can see the
difference but you see i can see in the
mirror see I can totally see a
difference but you can't really see it
too well she don't even get closer I
don't know I don't know I am gonna fix
my line or Roxanne I will I'm gonna fix
it it does look bad on that one side I'm
gonna fix it I'm gonna fix it right now
because bothering Roxanne you can see it
good but i love the way finishing powder
just brings everything all together it's
like my new obsession is finishing
powder alright this is oh hi Valerie
this is the translucent powder by bare
minerals is the illuminating touch-up
veil um and it's translucent and it's
just a nice powder and it goes away it's
just you know finishing powder it's very
nice christus says the offer always has
at least 30
off code she never pays full price so
there you go all right let me fix my
engineer because it's bothering people
it's bothering me to touch bothering you
it's bothering me too so don't feel like
doing this for you I'm doing it for me
too definitely it's hard to hold a
mirror and do this at the same time cuz
usually my mirror is like sitting up so
it just makes a little more difficult
but this definitely needs to be fixed
hopefully I don't make it worse we'll
see what happens alright sorry you
watching me meet watching you watching
me okay all right it's a little bit
better not totally better but a little
bit better I'm gonna have to do until we
have two hands it's definitely not the
most epic eyeliner I've ever done Oh
Jody um it says this jen have any videos
about brushes and the best uses not just
for shape but also Bristol's versus than
natural business bristles versus
synthetic i'm starting to wonder maybe
my bristol choice is making my makeup
issues i don't know a lot about the
bristle thing so yes i wish i did i do
have one about the about different kinds
of makeup brushes that was a live
Charlie did not that long ago but it
doesn't go into the whole synthetic vs
natural because I'm not very educated in
that to be completely honest with you
pull this down a little bit okay Liz so
lot I have so many lip choices I have
all these Oprah ones tons of ofra so I'm
thinking like Pasadena because I want to
do something naturally on my lips or I
have this one by butter london that i've
never used looks like this I think it's
kind of pretty it is called
tough Oh for you get um they sounded
some beauty supply stores but I get my
stuff on Oprah online and then we could
you melted chocolate not chocolate
diamonds that one's creepy um we could
do the chocolate honey order we could do
oh no we're on there's one more i wanted
where we could do sugar daddy i was
thinking but this one's kind of warm I
don't want to do I have a cool look or a
warm look I don't even know what I have
at this point huh so we could do sugar
daddy we could do the butter london we
could do pasadena or we could do the
chocolate honey oh no wonder about
butter london you know I don't really
know a lot of a butter lemon let's use
the butter london but I've never use
this I don't know I get scared because I
don't really like their polishes that
much and that's like their thing so it's
like I don't know whether it's good or
not like i always get scared to use it
because if polish the thing and I don't
really like their polishes very much the
makeup cannot be that good you know so
we're going to try this one word and try
the butter london one ooh it smells like
mint chocolate it's a little tiny bit
sticky
but it's going away the sickies going
away very creamy I don't know I kind of
like it you're saying is that she likes
butter london blushes yeah compassionate
beauty says they're polishes do not last
yeah I'm not a big fan I don't like the
way up they apply either let me look at
this in a real mirror I feel like that
looks pretty good it feels a little
thick and I can definitely still smell
that minty chocolate mint tea on my lips
if you don't like that you're not going
to like this but I like this I think it
looks good it's got a shine to it it
doesn't seem like it's turning Matt in
any way this is the lippy bloody
brilliant lip crayon int off that's what
that looks like there but I think I like
it I think it looks really good
especially with such a neutral natural
eyeliner an eyeliner eyeshadow neutral
natural I look I really like it so
Samantha says the butter london polishes
are really watered out what makes them
Shipley fastest yeah I feel about him I
don't really like it I don't really like
their polishes all right I'm going to
move over to this um this is the
finished look we're done like it looks
really good looks very natural I could
have gone more sculpted but like
seriously like with that one with a
l'oreal you can't really sculpt it out
much like because it's such a bronzy
kind of sculpting like shade it doesn't
really work so we went really natural
neutral but overall I'm really happy
with the way the look came out i'll
definitely be posting a picture of this
on instagram i'm going to use my real
camera and take some pictures so that
maybe I could get like a good shot of it
so you can see what it looks like off of
this camera and on like a really good
camera um so yeah we'll be doing that my
