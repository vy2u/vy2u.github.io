the weekly what's up and makeup chat I
am so happy to be here with you I just
realized I need to move my mic over a
little bit to the center because you can
usually hear me better when I go to the
center so hopefully this week we have
everything fixed hopefully the lighting
is fixed the camera is fixed it's a
little crooked but hopefully we're okay
and hopefully the streaming speed is
okay it looks like I might be a little
bit delayed I'm gonna wait and see what
the collective brain says which would
surprise me because it's still at the
same setting that it was before but let
me know if it's lagging and I'll fix
that good morning to everybody in the
collective brain so let's just talk a
little bit about what we're going to be
doing today
so we're gonna be going over the old so
21 days of beauty weeks 2 &amp;amp; 3 which is
happening right now and next week and we
run out some products to show you and I
also want to show you my haul from last
week everybody saying it is lagging okay
but I do want to show you my haul from
last week because after the show last
week I did do a little bit of shopping
so looking what I got let me see if I
can get the lag to stop let's see how
did I do this last time it's like
remembering what I did to fix that
um what did I do I'm trying to remember
the buttons I pushed output no that's
not it stream no general no what did I
do last time how did I do this last time
II don't remember oh I don't want to sit
here forever and play with this but I
also don't want it to look like doodoo
either it looks like it might be
catching up now though like my voice
seems to be matching a little bit better
now
okay so it looks like maybe it was ok
everybody looks like I'm okay so it
might have just been the initial part of
the stream but definitely keep me posted
those of you that are here in live chat
if it doesn't something's wrong with it
cuz I didn't mess with anything so now
I'm getting nervous because it's not any
it's not pleasant to watch a live stream
where the voice does not match up with
the face but this camera quality is just
so much better that I really want to
keep it if I can alright so let's just
start off first with one little
housekeeping issue I just started doing
giveaways on Twitter last week I did a
giveaway of 6 sheet masks for sharing
the make up news show I haven't put it
up yet for this week I usually put it up
on Monday and I don't know if I'm gonna
put up today or Monday but make sure
you're following me on Twitter this week
we're gonna do a giveaway of the the
bombs nude dude
palette and all you need to do is
retweet the news show again it is not up
right now but I do I didn't have it I
wanted to try to put up before the
before we went live but it couldn't do
it I ran out of time but keep an eye out
on my Twitter for this and then I'm all
you do is retweet it for a chance to win
and yeah so the masks are given away and
I'll be mailing those out tomorrow
tomorrow yeah tomorrow or Tuesday to the
winner for their the mic is loud Amanda
says no one's ever complained about that
before I don't know what to do with that
mic is reverb and try what in the world
it's so weird
ok I see it let's see if I can OOP how's
that there we go that should be better
ok we should be good now thank you so
much I appreciate yes too loud everybody
saying too loud hopefully it's better
now there we go thank you everybody for
helping me I appreciate you because I
can't
all I hear I see is seeing and he goes
no better than I do okay thank you so
much for that and I apologize to anybody
with headphones so anyway my point is
make sure you find me on Twitter if you
want to be a part of the giveaways all
you do is retweet the show it's just a
way for me to get more views and more
subscribers and give you something as a
thank you for trying to get me more
views and subscribers whoever tells you
that no and I copied the idea of James
Charles so that is that for for
transparency all right let me show you
my haul my Ulta haul from last week and
then well man I'm still saying it's it's
lagging again I don't know what suit
well let me show you the hole and we'll
see if it catches up hopefully it
doesn't do this the entire time the
thing I'm most excited about is the
lipstick queen lipsticks that I got I
got two of them I got the what you call
it the ones that are a little more sheer
I got Saint Saint natural and Saint
Bordeaux these are the Saints I forget
it sang it in something lipsticks so
there's the st. natural and it looks
like that it just gives like a wash of
color
and then this one is st. Bordeaux I
wanted to get ones that were a little
bit darker because I feel like darker
lipstick sometimes are a little too
vampy on me and now looking at them side
by side they're almost identical which
makes me a little bit sad the one in st.
Bordeaux is a little bit more Brown but
they're almost exactly the same which
totally bums me out but I do like the
formula unfortunately it does fade
relatively quickly it's almost like a
hyped up look that I hit up like a
beefed up lip balm as far as the way
that it looks on the lips I do think
they're very pretty but I think they're
overpriced at regular price but its sale
price I think they're still on sale I
think they were part of the I think they
are I think they're part of the you know
I didn't stand a load of the collective
brain I need to do that yes they're part
of the Hot Buys to the $14 each I think
they're worth $14 I don't think they're
worth any more than that I also got the
makeup revolution conceal and define
while I was there I wore this last night
really liked it from first impression
but it's just the first impression I
also got the LA girl Pro matte
the foundation also really liked that I
work for the first time again that last
night and then I react on my mat nude
primer from Ulta the matte one and then
I got the champagne one I didn't think
the champagne one was any better than
the the matte one as far as like it
being underneath shadows I'm gonna have
to play with it a little more but that
was my little haul that I did from last
week and now let me go ahead and say
hello to the people that are here alive
and the collective brain if you're
watching this on the replay hang tight
for a quick second I just like to say
hello because I find that to be polite I
think that it's a little bit rude for me
to invite people into my house and then
not even say hello to people so tabatha
is here she says well we were waiting
for Jenn and once you all go thumbs up
the video right now thanks Tom jess is
here a saint is here ast is here thumbs

completely honest and am busier and
Lindsay and pink lamb girl and Melissa
good to see everybody and if I did not
say hello to you hello to you thank you
so much for being here I appreciate you
alright so let's go ahead and get into
what is happening in the 21 days of
beauty this week let's look at this
together and let's have a conversation
so we're gonna start with today right
here March 25th which is Oh Nadine wants
to know what she and I got in the LA
girl I got beige and then for the makeup
revolution can see Linda fine I got C
Phi life whatever that is C 5 it doesn't
say the name of the color well that's a
bummer C 5 hopefully that means
something cuz I'll be sad if that's
mean anything because I don't know all
right but anyway back to this it
cosmetics confidence in a compact is now
$19 I've never tried that so I don't
know anything about that one I know
nothing about it
meesa says Jen I love you but it's
actually not pronounced Misa lol Matt my
name is Melissa and Missa is just a
nickname
ah Missa I got you girl miss up I think
I'll get it I'll get it for next time
thank you alright yeah I've never tried
this so I don't know anything about it
I'm curious to see if the collective
brain knows anything about that Danielle
says C could mean cool tone I hope so
that might be interesting and good if
they did that Oh Joe does say cool tone
very nice thank you for that appreciate
it everybody's telling me about that
nice all right
Annie says hi Annie you know Emily
Noelle 83 made made me order the Mallee
blotting deal from today I also picked
up the it cosmetics brush for $11 yeah
we're gonna talk about in a second you
have the it brushes that are it says now
$11 the air smoothing foundation brush I
don't own this particular brush but I do
really love it it brushes just in
general I like the it brushes for old
sigh I like the it brushes they're
really nice brushes I usually find them
to be very expensive though so I don't
purchase them very often but on sale I
think that's a great deal
I don't but again I don't own this
particular brush it looks very nice
though it looks nice got notifications
popping up okay half Korean girl says
confidence in a cream is good it looks
great thank you so much for that I
appreciate it
Michelle says love it foundation brushes
in particular very nice
nettie I have the it brush it's nice
very good very cool okay so I guess not
a lot of people have tried that it's not
a lot of comments on that one Adrian
says can you review the makeup brand
called found it's for sale on Walmart I
don't know anything about that I've
never even heard of it that's
interesting Lyla are you ok honey okay
John hurt your leg are you okay
here stay back out of the camera since
you're new Jamis okay come here come
here I can't say no to a hug that's me
yes it's like a 30 second lag oh so okay
there you go there you are all right bye
all right bye sweetheart
are you okay yeah did he just bump into
you or something weird okay all right so
anyway let me see if there's anybody
else that comments it on I can't say no
to hugs
I just can't manda Joe says I found
setting spray and love it yeah I've
never even heard of that - check it out
Teresa says I have dry skin and can't
use the powder I wonder if Malley would
work mmm do you know no all right let's
go ahead and move on to the next one
so we have March 26 which is tomorrow we
have the Becca backlight priming filter
and first light priming filter 19
dollars each and the Lancome Hypnose
drama instant full volume mascara is now
1375 so hold that up for you so you can
see I actually do have one of the
Beckley Becca backlight priming filters
I got this in a boxycharm I believe oh
no this is a shimmering skin perfecter
liquid this is different oh man I
thought I had it but I don't this is the
backlight so this is okay this is the
one you're supposed to put on under your
foundation I don't own that nevermind I
was going to compare it to the collab
one because the collab one is really
really good this kind of be in my
monthly favorites it's really good I'm
really enjoying this one but I don't
have it I thought I did but I don't
so I can't comment on it man I thought I
could dharna mr. Ashton says the
backlight is nice awesome
hi Shirley Shirley was the first one to
comment on what's up in makeup today I'm
definitely stocking up on the Becca
backlight primer oMG it's so great see I
thought I had it but I don't I looked at
it too quickly because it looks the same
like the packaging is the same so I
thought I had it because I glanced too
fast but I don't have that gallery says
the mic is super blown out what is going
on yeah I don't know what the
differences are I don't own them
Michelle says I saw the shake tape is on
sale for $15 if you buy the new
foundation okay I don't I don't see that
one on here it might be on the online
only deals if you go to their website
you'll be able to see these deals plus
oh I believe one more everyday for
platinum members so I don't know bristle
says it sounds good on her ends
hopefully it's not lagging any more
hopefully we're doing okay on the leg
when we just click over because I don't
want it to be annoying we're a little
annoying it's not so bad okay let's say
mr. Ashton says no the lilac one is a
different primer Monica says just woke
up I'm here now yay Alysia says
backlight is very glowy and illuminating
first light is more hydrating thank you
so much for that Alicia I appreciate
that so much
janae ow backlight would probably be
better for dry skin the first light is
more subtle gloww see this is why the
collective brain is very important we're
learning so much epi there's a there's a
big misconception that people who make
youtube videos no more than the people
in the comment section and that is not
true
sometimes the people in the comments
that should know a lot more than the
person making the video I'll tell you
that
Jackie says everything looks good okay
I'm gonna trust Jackie because I don't
feel like messing with it oh I'm going
with my favorite answer on how
everything looks right now Krishna says
Jen check the back of the flier the
Chart foundation concealer deal is on
the very back thank you so much let's
look
oh there it is okay so I got rid of my
my addressee thing so it says tart by
double duty shape tape Foundation and
get $15 for the concealer well there you
go is this everyday
I guess it's everyday cool yep it's
right there nice thank you so much for
that I appreciate it
yeah I'm still not buying I don't know I
just I saw I have like shaved concealer
though I do like my shave tape concealer
Monica wants to know is live chat at
2:00 next week no live chat next week
because it's Easter Sunday
so we're skipping it next week sorry it
says okay people don't kill me don't
kill me people I don't like the shape
shape you're not the only person if you
have to use the tiniest tiniest little
bit some people I don't know how they do
it when I see people use a shape tape
foundation and they like paint it all
over like holy moly it must be they must
not have a single fine line anywhere on
their face like I don't get how they do
that it looks horrible on me when I do
that all right let's move on to oh the
Lancome Hypnose drama instant full
volume mascara I don't think I've tried
that one so I can't speak to that one so
no I'm sorry I can't speak to that one
Missy says I can't do triangle concealer
I can do it with most concealers but I
can't do it I can't do with that one
it's too much it's too much hi Elizabeth
Teresa Tuesday I'm getting the lorac
palette I've never had one okay we're
gonna talk about that we're gonna get to
that okay so I have no opinion on the
Lancome Hypnose drama anybody else have
an opinion on that one I've never tried
to shape tape foundation I made a
commitment when that came out that I am
only going to purchase well I'm only
going to review for the channel products
that have an inclusive shade range
because there's no point in me reviewing
products that don't have an inclusive
shade range because a good chunk of my
audience can't buy it so I feel like I
shouldn't buy things like that for
review Katie says Lancome Hypnose drama
is amazing very voluminous and nice
thank you so much for that Katie I
appreciate it Marina says I've tried the
Hypnose doll eyes it's good but a little
flaky Shirley said I heard the Lancome
mascara is really wet awesome
Georgia Harris is here from Georgia
Harris go check out her YouTube channel
she's one of my face Kayla says I love
the mascara but lots of flaking okay and
Camila says I find Lancome mascara too
clumpy alright let's go ahead and move
on to Tuesday I do have something to
show you here this is the lorac pro
contour palette it's $20
I would say that is a definite recommend
from me to you I have it here it was
sent to me up by the rock and not that
long ago but I fell in love with it this
was something I had my eye on when it
first came out and I just was one of
those when I saw it I was like no I
don't need it
see it no I don't need it see it I don't
need it like it but I really wanted it
but I never got it and then they sent it
to me I was like and I really liked it
it's totally worth the hype let me go
ahead and do some swatches for you just
so you can see what we're dealing with
on my skin tone hopefully you'll be able
to see the lighter shade so we felt like
that more of a peachy highlight shade
we've got a yellow tone highlight shade
and then we've got a shimmery highlight
shade and then for the bottom we've got
light contour deep contour and then
medium contour and actually fine I
really like all three of these on my
skintone sometimes I feel like a deep
contour sometimes I feel like it's it
looks really good on me I just have to
apply it with a light hand and I really
enjoy all of these I do I think they're
all very nice you know I've used the I
don't really use the yellow highlight
that's probably the only one that I
don't use just because I don't like the
way it looks on me it just doesn't match
me but I've used the beige highlight
which is a little bit pink toned I've
used that to set my under eyes it's very
nice the scheme' Holly they're really
like for underneath my brows and I've
used all three of these contour shades
and I love these are so buttery and
creamy lasting power is really good very
easy to blend buildable all of that love
it love it love it okay yeah we only
have 300 people and usually it's 400
people must be busy I'll have to change
it cuz you know I predict that it's
gonna be 400 but you know I I don't know
who's gonna show up so so that's a
definite recommend the lorac palette and
I saw a bunch of people talking about
that it's they really enjoy the palette
as well in the chat and now you'll be
able to see the chat over on the sides
even curiouser says the yellow is good
under the eyes I don't like the way it
looks me on
under my eyes Oh missus says Palm Sunday
there you go
that might be why and this steal a
convertible color lip and cheek cream I
used to own a couple of these years ago
and I didn't really like them very much
I found them to kind of blend into the
skin without giving enough pigmentation
for me but again that was years ago
so I can't really speak to the way they
are now maybe they changed they're
really more for people that want a very
subtle look at least at least the way
that I I remember them but I haven't had
in a while because mine got old and I
didn't repurchase and I don't think I
would repurchase these but if you like a
nice light wash of color and you're
there then these might work better for
you
at 12:50 I wouldn't invest in that
that's just me Gina says not getting
this deal a product em guzman says is
the lorac palette cream or powder it is
powder let me just make sure on here
yeah it's powder and it does come with a
brush the brush is kind of like the NARS
eita brush it's like one of those flat
brushes I'm not quite sure where it is
right now else I pull it out for you
but it's very nice youyou kind of chisel
out here and then you blend with a
different brush but with a fluffier
brush then you kind of Pat it down you
started at the top of your ear and move
toward your corner of your mouth and
just kind of make it go to the center of
your eyeball like right here so you Pat
it down and then blend it out with a
fluffier brush amanda says she's not
getting a steal a product
yeah Krista says I feel like this week
is just mad I don't know I mean I feel
like that we've got some good things
this week I feel like with the you know
that cut the pro contour definitely is
definitely a highlight for me and also
there's a couple of other well there's
two other things this week that I'm
excited about and the next one is for
the next day the March 28th The Tortoise
double-take oh no it's a double take I
thought it was this so fun tart really
has very underrated eyeliners I've never
tried the double-take specifically but
they're eyeliners have been great for me
I've really enjoyed them so I would
probably invest the $12 to try that one
just because I trust Tarte eyeliners
they've just been so good for me I've
never had a dud Tarte eyeliner
I feel like they're eyeliners are super
underrated that's just my opinion but
yeah that might be something that I
would think about I don't know I don't
really need it right now
but we'll see Julie says have been
watching me on my TV's I couldn't
comment but here watching oh hi Julie
and then we have the SI water
travel-size advanced night repair and de
web creme they're eight dollars each
I've never tried those I think I might
have tried the advanced night repair but
I don't it doesn't stand out to me as
being like something I remember so it's
like a little dropper bottle see if I
can get that up on the screen so you can
see so I've never tried that so I can't
speak to that either
Stacy says the chart double-sided
eyeliner is wonderful the liquid side is
amazing but the pencil side is okay
worth trying thank you for that Jenny I
like the San Tropez self-tanner that is
this week as well yeah we'll go let's
see if we have time to go to the Online
Deals I'd like to go platinum reveals I
want to focus on the ones that are not
platinum first and then if we have time
we'll go to the Platinum stuff
Jordan says also always seems to drop a
20% coupon right after sales and events
I'm trying not to get anything I'm not
really sure about there you go
but isn't it just on one item though the
20% coupon I can't remember it's been a
year or whatever so I don't know
anything but the Estee Lauder I don't
see anybody oh here we go Judy says
their fabulous face and eye creams thank
you Judy I didn't look at the
ingredients so I don't know I'm not sure
mr. Ashton that's what I'm waiting for
no not always on the 20% okay mr. Ashton
said this one will probably be on
everything thank you so much and then
Adrianna says the same thing and
probably on everything awesome thank you
so much that cuz I forget about that
again collective brain coming through
let's look at March 29th we have the
roller lash buy benefits $12 and the
murad acne clarifying cleanser and acne
an aging aunt at anti-aging acne
time-release cleanser $15 to $19 on the
29th so as far as the roller lash if I
remember correctly because it's been a
while it's very wet and I didn't I
thought it was okay I thought I think
it's good for that price for $12 I think
it would definitely be worth trying for
$12 because then we're talking drugstore
price there and I think that that's fair
I know there are some people that swear
by that roller lash love the roller lash
and one of the big things with roller
lash they claim is that it's supposed to
help you hold a curl I don't have that
problem my neck in my lashes and
actually have a little bit of curl even
though they're short and sparse they do
have one benefit no no pun intended that
they do hold a curl by themselves so I
can't really speak to that claim
personally but and remember really
liking the mascara but not loving the
mascara so have you heard about it and
you wanted to try it I think it's worth
the $12 because we're bringing it
again to drugstore price and I think
that any good mascara on at drugstore
price is worth it
Emily says roller lash versus Lancome
Hypnose drama I would say they're
similar I would say the lie if I
remember correctly the Lancome Hypnose
drama is that's not the one that's more
my max I remember trying to yeah they
Hypnose drama instant full volume
mascara see is that different than the
Hypnose drama because I've tried the
Hypnose drama but I don't know if I've
tried the the packaging does not look
the same as the one that I've tried some
thinking that the instant full volume
mascara is different than the regular
Hypnose drama because I think the
packaging unless they update the
packaging they're confusing me but as
far as compared to this one I can't
compare it because I don't think I've
tried this one but I've tried the
regular Hypnose drama I don't know girl
now I'm confused Debbie says I like the
roller lash but I don't need any mascara
right now Bonnie says people swear by
the Royal lash for that price I'm gonna
try it yeah and the other thing to keep
in mind with mascaras is if you can get
a sample size for like 10 12 dollars you
only supposed came for 3 months anyway
so chances are you're probably only
gonna use it for 3 months you know the
sample and you probably just need a
sample size one you know the deluxe
sample size anytime I can get as a luck
sample instead of a full size I'm all
about it because I throw them away after
three months Sandra says the roller lash
is amazing no transfer and separation
and separation is fab nice deanna roller
lash always will be my best look miss
Aurora lashes okay for length and
Crowell I prefer volume though and I
think that's where it falls flat on for
me to mess up same thing
Naomi says I just need a basic permanent
line mascara that's not going to clump
and flake on me well I wish you luck on
that one I wish you luck on that Mimi
says I used to love roller lash but now
I only use it it cosmetics okay
good to know good to know all right
let's move on to the Murad I don't have
acne so I don't know anything about the
acne cleanse acne stuff clarifying
cleanser I can't say anything about that
while we're waiting for people to talk
about the acne cleanser I just want to
say a little bit about the day 30 a day
30 March 30th March 30th is the melted
too faced melted matte liquefied long
wear lipstick those seem to be on sale
everywhere so definitely check those
might that might be the cheapest price
for them but I've seen those on sale I
think of a toothpaste website I think
I've seen them at Sephora those things I
think they're discontinuing that line of
stuff I only bought one of those and I
was quite disappointed in it but I got
the melted latex in the unicorn tears I
was waiting and waiting and waiting and
waiting for this to come out and it's
really just a gloss it's like a
pigmented gloss and I was expecting it
to be more opaque like on the latex you
know what I mean let me swatch it for
you so you can see ok saucer just says I
prefer the anti agent cleanser to the
acne cleanser when it comes to the Murad
thank you so much for that amber says
Murad is my favorite skincare brand I'm
going to be getting it nice Brook Murai
cleanser is great Teresa your ad is
great for acne daughter uses it daily
Monica just got it from my son and it's
clearing is acne up well there you go
Bonnie my daughter uses her murad acne
cleaner after two weeks her acne has
been clearing up rachel says i'm not a
fan of Murad overall Valerie I loved
amiright cleanser it's amazing
definitely helps clear up my acne well
thank you guys so much for all of that
thank you to the collective brain Jackie
says to face lips are to drawing I find
that with their liquid lipsticks this is
a different formula than the liquid
lipsticks have you tried the latex ones
because these are from me are more like
a gloss the liquid lipsticks I agree
with you though yeah it's a super thick
gloss and it's just I look I really
loved the original unicorn tears
lipstick now we've got our 400 people so
I didn't lie and I this one's got some
glitter in it and it just it's not my
fave it's fine I'm happy that I have it
for that a weird occasion where I want a
little bit of that shine but the other
problem with this is if you see how I
blended
out it lost all of the iridescent amber
says I found the latex ones to be sticky
a little bit a little bit like I can
feel it here a little bit Emily says
multi latex is discontinuing but the
liquid lipsticks are the one on sale
that day the melted mattes oh oh you're
right
thank you for correcting me I appreciate
that I don't know why I thought because
it's the same packaging again they got
me with the packaging you're right is
the melted mask I did not try the melted
mattes I did it again see I thought it
would I thought I had a messed up with
this one I messed up with this one growl
or boy
not happy with myself one that I got
about five hours of sleep last night
which is not unusual for me on on before
chat on a Saturday yeah Saturday night
so so let's talk about the melted mat
let's get the opinion from the
collective brand the melted Matt
marvelous says melted mat is great Karen
there's a new Too Faced lipstick coming
out does anyone know about those not
really I know the packaging Amanda
Veronica the Murad refreshing cleanser
hmm and there's typos here I'm having
trouble understanding oh and then it
just disappeared okay I want to say
almost 50 I'm missing at home I want to
sit and I love their anti-aging
moisturizer with SPF I want to say
almost $50 but don't quote me I can't
remember
okay got it she just ran out Thank You
Veronica for that Samantha thanks I
going on just reading things Oh trying
to find comments about the products here
all right so anyway sorry about that it
went on and on about the melted latex
and it wasn't even the right thing
apparently I can't read or I can't
process information Emily says she was
are melted not and sellout thank you so
much for that
amanda says I don't like how drying they
are thank you for that too
mama bear melted Matt's okay not my fave
formula
good morning toddler drama I'm late
well I'm so happy you're here I'm sorry
about your toddler drama I empathize
with you I've been there been there done
that totally with you all right Peter
Thomas Roth unwrinkle peel pads don't
know anything about those Peter Thomas
Roth seems to be very harsh for me I've
tried a couple of their skin care
products and I find that like for
whatever reason they seem to be really
intense I don't know what's going on but
I don't know if these unwrinkle peel
pads are the same thing but oh that's
okay Veronica I was trying to read it I
appreciate you I just wanted to know
what you were saying cuz I I want your
thoughts are important to me Tish Tosh
wants to try the Peter Thomas Roth pads
Angie wants a try beauty box review I
don't know anything about that I'll know
about the off to look that one up kay
Shogun's says I love Peter Thomas Roth
products Gina says Peter Thomas Roth is
very strong love the result I got from
the brand though Rebecca says Peter
Thomas Roth strips my skin Monica says
the under like gold patches are good
Melly likes the masks even curiouser
says the pads are harsh but not as harsh
as the dr. gross they were too intense
for me Jackie says they're okay
Jacqueline says she wants to try them
Michelle says use several of the Peter
Thomas Roth products they're very
effective well there you go
okay okay Shogun says fYI my name is
Kelly I'm gonna try to remember that I
will probably forget that one because
there's no canceling your name that your
name is Kelly so I'm probably good on
I might just call UK because I'll
probably forget but I'm gonna try really
hard to remember your name is Kelly I
will I will try alright this is the
other exciting one this week that I'm
excited about the anasazi Beverly Hills
skinny brow pencil for 10:15 I think
have you been itching to try that you
totally should
one thing that Anastacio has over a lot
of brands for their brow products is
that they make a huge range of colors I
don't know what's available at Ulta but
their shade range is really really good
compared to a lot of brands like for
example like I could compare this
formula to so many brow pencils but if
you can't find your shade like L'Oreal
the Loreal brow definer one is I think
it's like three shades something like
that and the dark brown is really really
really dark for me so I prefer the shade
from the honest honest yeah then that
one I mean there's so many good brow
pencils out there that are similar to
this but I think that austalia
definitely beats most brands as far as
the shade range and for 1050 I think
that's a heck of a deal because again
you're going down to drugstore prices
for the for the brow Wiz and you know
overall though I do want to mention this
is that the value of a brow of roll up
brow pencil like that is stupidly
expensive I mean it's it's ridiculous
the price per gram on these things
it's like thousands of dollars per gram
of product because you get so little
product in them but people really like
that style because you can get really
precise definition with pencils like
that so if you like a really precise
definition these are great just there's
not a lot of product in them so you have
to repurchase them a lot more often then
let's say a regular pencil brow product
or like a like a gel or you know things
like that they just run out a lot faster
because they're so little product and
therefore what you're paying for but
still at ten fifty I think that's a
great deal it's a wonderful brow product
I personally think that it's very
overpriced at the full price unless you
just can't find your shade anywhere else
let's see I'm a shot of sense I can't
stand you have no idea how much you have
left I know right because you're like
using it and using and using it and then
just one day you just have no more and
it's like there you go I guess I can't
do my brows today
misty says I'm micro bladed and still
need a good pencil for filling in my
fronts I gotta have ash Brown I hate an
orange brown
I've zero warmth I use the benefit
number four right now you benefit makes
some great brow products as well I
totally agree she a little X benefit
over a BH Emily loves her brow wiz it's
amazing jessica says Anasazi is the best
and he says I like the dark brown and or
espresso shade not too warm not too dark
Krista says I'm definitely getting the a
BH brow Wiz the color selection is the
best out there totally agree Jackie's
going to get one Rhonda says eye brow
Wiz is the one thing I freaked out about
when I run out of Samantha doesn't do
wear brows Georgia says I love the brow
Wiz and the dip brow yes dip brow is
intense though you ought to be like real
gentle with it but it is a great product
Karen I got the BH Cosmetics brow pencil
super good and cheap also had a similar
one as well yeah there's so many of them
so many of them that are comparable meli
says too skinny for me I like the fat
ones yeah I think depending on your brow
shape I mean if you have really really
thick brows the brow Wiz pencils like
that are probably gonna take a lot
longer to apply and let's say the
benefit what's the one the one that has
the teardrop shaped tip that I can never
remember the name of it the Too Faced
chocolate brownie I don't even know if
that's still available but but yeah you
have to decide based on the the
thickness of your brows but for
detailing and stuff if you want to get
real precise these are really really
good let's move on to Mario Badescu
because we're 36 minutes in and we still
have a whole week left Mario Badescu we
have the entire line is 25% off I've had
I've done a little bit of Mario Badescu
but not a lot and I've never done like
actual testing of it where I was just
using Mario Badescu and nothing else and
you know really being intense with it
I've never tried stuff like that so I
can't really speak to it but I've heard
kind of hit and miss I've heard that
it's overpriced I've heard that it works
really well for some people so I'm
curious to know what the collective
brain thinks of that and if you're
watching this on the replay please feel
free to comment down below your thoughts
on these things I think that would be
great
Beatriz loves Mario Badescu Aspen's she
thinks it's me
Missy I only use the facial sprays
Jordan I think they're ROS face race
smells like potpourri
good to know I've live is here from live
lobster makeup I really like Mario
Badescu been using their products ever
since college nice thanks Liv for
chiming in much appreciate it make sure
you go check out Liv loves her makeup if
you're not already subscribed to her go
check her out another one of my favorite
channels Paige rosehip oil is pretty
good unless a long time the only way to
make it better would be a darker bottle
to prevent the effects of light on the
product Heather says I heard the highway
chronic cream eye cream is really good
but I haven't tried it for myself
marina Mario is often on sale on
beautybay but I've never tried it
Claudia I had his rose spray and gave it
to my mom but then bought the lavender I
like I like to use it at night cool
Alysia not a fan of Mario Badescu too
much fragrance even curiouser I second
the drying lotion being great Mario
breaks someone else and then I lost it
everybody's saying hi to live hide to
live live is very well-loved Kelly said
the facial spray was great toner broke
me out good to know all right moving on
to April first finally moved on a week
to the bare minerals foundation prime of
the prime time I can talk about this one
I really like the prime time I think
it's very nice I think it's gonna be
best in my opinion for people with drier
skin because it is a hydrating primer
it's like a lotion almost when you put
it on it seeps into skin the lice like
lotion I was really sad when I ran out
of it I actually got it in a bare
minerals mystery box that I had bought
and I used it to the very last drop it
was I really enjoyed that primer because
it just it feels good on the skin and I
just I felt like it may help my makeup
to last longer my makeup saddle on top
of it really nicely well with silicone
based primers I feel like sometimes my
foundation breaks up over top of it
depending on the foundation that I'm
using but I felt like with the prime
time I could use it with anything and it
helped everything so it was really
Universal for me I really love that
product
vital dietary supplement do we even want
to go there I don't know anything about
that way 50% off it's now $50 it's
regularly $99 what is in this stuff I
did not go to Ulta to look up vitamins
when I was doing the halo Beauty review
I got a look now and see what is in this
stuff I'm going to Ulta calm we have got
to see the ingredients in here I am so
curious right now not that I'm gonna
necessarily know about it see you all
right all of the towel let's see holy
moly a hundred bucks
HGH dietary supplement y'all know what
this stuff is l-lysine HC IL r d9 h CI
ox o proline and axel l-cysteine
glutamine skits on PETA aerial parts
powder
holy moly what is that with aerial parts
powder let's see what the description of
this is what even is this stuff if
you're commenting I can't read it right
now because I'm looking to see oh
there's a there's a video optimum growth
hormone levels have been associated with
a wrinkle reduction tightening saggy
skin decreasing body fat increase lean
muscle mass stronger bones improved mood
heightens something I'm not going to say
drives because there might be children
watching and making users look and feel
decades not years but decades younger
that is a claim right there Sarah what's
how high is the first and only
clinically proven there's that word HGH
booster to increase mean androgynous
serum or blood growth hormone levels by
682 percent and both men and women of an
appropriately wide age range what in the
world is this stuff they're yellow pills
how many do you get for a hundred bucks
human growth hormone is what it is I
know nothing about this I'm 120 capsules
let's see how many you have to take take
four capsules by mouth on an empty
stomach in morning two hours before
breakfast in two hours after dinner Wow
so 120 and you take four a day so is
that four eight twelve so that's a
month's supply for a hundred dollars a
month so this knocks it down to fifty
dollars a month I am curious I'm going
over to the collective brain right now
I've got to see what everybody's saying
all right six hundred eighty two percent
don't know where they get that that's
where that reminds me of those mascara
claims when it's like improves lash
volume by three thousand four hundred
ninety one percent and it's like really
you had to take it to 91 percent like
how do you even measure this stuff so I
don't even know ya Georgia says decades
younger I'd love to look like a fetus
again it's why I love Georgia Harris oh
my gosh yeah I don't I Wow
decade younger so that would make me
look like I was in my I was like in my
late teens early 20s Wow what's the
source for aghgh oh no I have no idea it
doesn't say it does say aerial parts
though I don't know what that means bird
wings I I don't know I've no idea
there's a video though you can go over
to Ulta and check it out I've no idea
now when threw me for a loop Deana says
I use HGH after my last pregnancy to
lose weight and get my skin and hair
back to healthy how did it work I have
to know
and he says really $100 bottle it's not
even a bottle it's like the the blister
packs I don't know banshee Muse says dr.
Perricone vitamins are like a hundred
and twenty dollars but I never bought
and that is why I don't know why
everyone's freaked out over halo Beauty
um I don't know well there's lots of
reasons but you know it me says like
Ariel The Little Mermaid parts maybe
that'd be terrible that thing of a buzz
take them with the breakfast and for
after dinner
I don't know man all right moving on
April 2nd I can't even okay let's talk
about butter LONDON glaze and I gloss
and lip plates I have heard such good
things about this I'm thinking about
getting this 952 $12 its regular $19 to
$24 the price has set me off and also
I've had terrible luck with butter
LONDON and general I just terrible
terrible luck with them so but I've
heard good things about these glaze and
I glosses so I might actually break down
and get that Shiseido urban environment
oil free UV protector I've never tried
that I do like some Shiseido stuff I
don't like other Shiseido stuff
it's very hit and miss for me Claudia
says the eye glosses are nice Julie
loves the eye glosses Dollface from AJ
says April first dose of colors maybe
shadow is on sale okay good to know is
that the Platinum one butter Lennon is
way too glittery Jackie says Gina
completely agreed terrible luck with
butter LONDON to my own experiences
naveen says get oil slick or mermaid
unicorn sucked on the eye gloss good to
know thank you
Annie wants the the Shiseido Sheila says
recommended under makeup SPF I don't
know about this one are you asking for
my recommendation my favorite one is the
julep the julep primer on that primer
the julep what's it called no something
no excuses I really love that one
because it doesn't smell like strong
like sunscreen I don't like the smell of
sunscreen so I really like that one
Sarah says the moonshine color is
amazing
mary said the purple Pantone stuktv I
heard that all the Pantone stuff from
them was terrible karen says mermaid is
just the glitter pass on that one
okay good to see a few different
perspectives on that one Tracy do these
alte products sell out and could you put
products in your cart and hold onto them
for days would still be on sale where
the price change back to the original
price do you believe the price would
change back to the original price and if
it does sell out I don't think that it
gets it holds there I think you have to
buy it and it'll say it's not in your
cart anymore so I don't think that
that's something that you can do I think
you need to like get it Mellie says the
Shiseido is - is this you say
- white interested I don't know Samantha
yeah I like icing moonshine and oil
slick good to know that's for the butter
LONDON
AAS ace a saint a saint I'm just gonna
keep saying seen stephanie nicole has a
good sunscreen video loud muffin - thank
you so much for that Shauna says butter
LONDON needs to go away have not liked
anything thing from them up okay moving
on April 3rd it's coming in like 15
minutes left laura geller baked blush
and brighten for $14 and the strike
vecten power starters tightening trio I
really like the Lord Gellar stuff
especially their highlighters the the
the baked gelato highlighters and the
blushes they're they're both really
really good they rock baked products
they're so underrated nobody talks about
them on YouTube and I don't know why why
do you know why it's because they don't
send out a lot of PR which I would love
to make a video on one day a wife I'm
planning on it it's on my list of things
that I definitely want to do but but
yeah they're very underrated and I think
that part of it is that they don't send
out a lot of PR and they're so good
they're just give this nice beautiful
wash of color without it being
overpowering I mean you can build them
up but they're just gorgeous on the skin
and the highlighter is gorgeous I love I
love Laura Geller cheek products Laura
Geller everything is not great but their
cheek products are so good so definitely
recommend on the blushes the Laura
Geller blushes for $14 oh my gosh yeah
absolutely
the strive vecten I've never tried I
have a friend my best friend Mary Lynn
she swears by the strive act in this she
likes the pink line whatever that is I
know that I'm time I ever see the strobe
act and pink stuff I always think of her
because that's her favorite but I've
never tried the tightening trio I don't
know anything about that but I have
heard I've looked at ingredient 2x for
straight back in products and they seem
to be good overall but I haven't looked
at this particular one so I can't speak
to it mr. Ashton love's strive act in
heathers Vandy says 100% agree with you
on the laura geller products I have
several of her blushes I love the baked
of Brighton Foundation and one of
cream highlighter sticks as well Martha
is here I'm happy you're here Amy says
Lord Gellar powder products are
wonderful Luka army girls try Becton is
a really good brand I use the stretch
mark cream which is from the pink line
and it works Alison so much dry Vechten
at Marshall's in t.j.maxx that is very
true that is very very true Missa I love
my Lord Geller filter finish setting
powder awesome
Jessica leg laura geller spackle primer
on my aunt's swears by that stuff and
tish-tosh I've seen strive backed and
sold at Costco - I have - yep I'm with
you totally with you Gina I think after
this sale all I'm getting from and all
I'm getting from Sephora I'm going to
have to declutter sue - Colette or
series again yeah I'm due for a
declutter as well I'm totally with you
all right let's move on April 4th that's
my brother's birthday right there and I
do have one of those products - and if
you're looking at it and you know my
channel you probably know which one I'm
going to show you we have the lipstick
Queen Frog Prince lipstick for 12:50 and
then the dermablend loose setting powder
I have lipstick Queen I love this
lipstick I do it's we're very well loved
it's like got like a fuzz on it and
everything
I love this lipstick it's not green let
me swatch it for you so you can see they
say it changes to your body chemistry
which is a lie it changes to your body
heat I think it's heat I don't want to
say it because I don't want to lie
either but it definitely is not like a
chemistry thing like it changes are
different on different people it just
has to do with when it comes in contact
with with skin and it just changes color
so it always makes me cringe one and
plus a lot of the stuff like you can buy
this stuff for really really cheap they
have like a lot of there's like Chinese
brands that sell these for really really
cheap but I think the difference with
this one is I love the shade of
I love the wash of color and it does it
just looks beautiful on and I really
like it
Naomi says I hate gimmicky
color-changing nonsense you know I mean
lips Annie says lipstick queen is over
price it is but I love this one I too I
have to say I really like this one I'm
very thankful to have it I did return it
quite a few products when I did my full
review of this frog prints line I
returned quite a few products this was I
kept this and I kept the blush because I
do really like it is it a must-have no
it's not a must-have but if you think
it's as fun as I think it is I think
it's worth it for the sale price
definitely i'm anthing lipstick queen
overall like I was mentioning with the
saint's lipsticks earlier I think that
it's all overpriced but at the sale
price I think they're fun I like it I
like it
as far as the dermablend I've never
tried it loose setting powder one ounce
13:50 but I've heard great things about
Donal blend in general so that was
definitely one that I'm curious about
definitely list says the elf lip glow is
heat activated and love it
nice Jackie says the dermablend powder
is amazing
Dollface says I use dermablend every day
Sara says I hear the powder is good I
think anyone have any one happen what do
you guys use it oh she's just asking
questions about it don't know Stacy I
love the elf gotta glow it's beautiful
Jeana getting the dermablend no idea of
its reputation yet but I want to try it

hello dawn Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
potion $10 or $12 jump on it uh jump on
it yes if you've never tried Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer potion this is a great
time to do it it's fantastic I showed I
mean it's my go to reliable eyeshadow
primer for me I don't have wheelie lids
so I don't know if you have oily lids or
dry lids if that's gonna make a
difference I would love you know if
collective brain for that but for me the
eyeshadow primer potion from Urban Decay
is a must-have I can't even imagine like
not having that I whenever I run out of
it I always repurchase there's no doubt
about it I manifest this muses anyone
miss Kimberly Clark Erza just me yes I
miss Kimberly Clark very much
I haven't touch base with her in a long
time she's out on tour I believe I think
she's on her to wear backup singing tour
trying to see but yeah definitely yes on
the Urban Decay primer potion
let's see people are saying a Nettie
I love the UD primer potion as well my
lids are a bit oily by the way good to
know
Brianna loves the primer potion Leanne
says I have very dry Liz and the primer
potion looks too cakey good to know Gina
says dry as a bone everywhere else
oil is let's ever what the heck Ezra I
have crazy oily lids and urban decay is
the only one that works Amy I've oily
lids and it works great for me I blot my
lids first yes is it all of them or is
it just the original it just I says
eyeshadow primer potion if you can get
the Eden Eden is great and the
anti-aging is fantastic list says the
anti Asian version absolutely it's
really good
I really like it definitely recommend on
that oh by the way they do have if
you're shopping at Sephora right now
there's an urban decay point perk you
can get one
100 points I'm not sure if it's a full
size or the sample size they also have
one that's a 500 point where you get the
perversion mascara the an eyeliner and
the primer potion so just so you know
that I just happened to shop it's for
the other day online so I know that cuz
I ordered it but yeah definitely
recommending on the the primer potion
now the juice beauty stem cellular anti
wrinkle boost serum i juiced Beauty has
been very hit and miss for me there's
definitely been some wins from Juice
Beauty and then I had a really big fail
where burned my skin but overall I like
the Juice Beauty line I don't know
anything about the stem cellular
anti-wrinkle boost C or a booster serum
and know anything about that one
Amy says I got a five mature point one
mascara in the primer both full-size
nice the perversion mascara from Urban
Decay is fantastic
definitely actually it was out with my
friend Marilyn last night and one of her
friends was like can you recommend a
good mascara and perversion was more
than once I recommended perversion steal
a huge L'Oreal voluminous butterflies
another really good one and of course my
ass and / princess and Jordana Jordana
best lash extreme those are some of my
favorites Debra says its original
anti-aging sin and Eden on the urban
decay definitely I sin is the shimmery
one I believe and I think I really like
that one too I think I like there was
one called original sin that I really
really liked
I think sins different than original sin
though LC RN says you're making me want
to shop at all its after this Jen oh
stop it all it's after this hey I am NOT
trying to encourage consumerism I'm not
I'm not doing that on purpose I'm trying
to like help you make decisions on if
you if you should get something or not
so you don't waste your money that's
that's kind of my job I feel I haven't
seen anybody talk about the juice beauty
as far as what the deal is with that
we've got two days left and we've only
got four minutes left so I'm gonna give
it a go I've take my daughter to the
store to go buy her we're going to
Michaels to go get like diorama stuff
she has to build a colony for her one of
her classes she has to like we have to
get like little mini trees and stuff to
like build a colony in a box
oh she's inventing you know but anyway
so I have to go Jess says Juice Beauty
says it's all gluten-free but it's not
oh really good to know Heather's vanity
I've been using the juice beauty green
apple peel for sensitive skin I got a
sample of it allows me quite a while and
I really like it not sure if I want to
splurge and buy that serum though yeah I
don't know it's 28 so no it's $40 it's
regularly $80 so it's still pretty
pricey even at half off all right April
sixth chart and Dermalogica we've got
the tarte quick dry matte lip paint
creamy matte lip paints and glossy lip
paints and lip crayons ten
dollars each and then Dermalogica daily
micro foliot 428 50 and I can tell you
the lip paints I do not like I find them
to be very very dry they do dry down if
you like the steel of ones you'll
probably like the tart ones I don't like
either one I find them to be way too dry
the creamy matte lip paint I don't know
if I've tried the creamy or the glossy
ones or the lip crayon
well the lip crayon is just looks like
it's just a lip liner yeah at this point
I can't recommend any of that stuff
Heather's vanity Dermalogica I might go
ahead and pull the trigger on that I do
like some Dermalogica stuff but I'd have
to look at like the ingredients and
stuff on that to see but Dermalogica
does have some nice stuff
mr. Ashwin agreed on the matte lip paint
very drying anonymous vlogger tartlet
paints are so drying Camilla honestly I
don't see much this season for the sale
I'm only going getting the Peter Thomas
Roth unwrinkle pads because they're
awesome the brow is and the better than
sex mascara by the way the chart mate
matte lip paints we're poor I totally
agree pinkies done with the drying lip
products - curious about the microphone
Yente Stacy says no to the Tarte
lipstick hello dry butthole lips
sums it up sums it up totally our April
7th max prep and prime fix + hydrating
setting spray for $13 the better than
sex mascara 11:50 and then the benefit
brow wax is free with which we learned
last week it's not actually free it's
free with a benefit purchase $50 benefit
cosmetic purchase if you already plan on
buying benefit products and yeah go for
it do it I really like the brow bar at
least the estheticians that I work with
at the brow bar and my brow bar they're
amazing I don't know about your
particular brow bar it's really hard to
kind of talk about that a little bit
last week but you have to buy the $50
for the benefit stuff so I would say if
you're not planning on buying benefit
Brown stuff I wouldn't get it just to
get the brow wax I think that's kind of
silly but if you already plan on getting
benefit brow stuff and getting a free
brow wax I would definitely recommend
trying it out the mac fix+ absolutely
I don't spray it all over my face
because
I don't like that but it's really nice
to have that on hand for brightening up
eyeshadows it's that's what I use it for
us I dip my brush in the shadow mostly
shimmery foiled kinds of shadows dip my
brush in the shadow spray it on though
you've probably seen this already spray
it on the brush and then apply it to the
eye and it just makes the shimmers and
the foiled shadows pop more so that's
what I use my fix+ for I really like it
for that and for thirteen dollars it's a
no-brainer for me that that would be a
good purchase that's just me the better
than sex mascara that brings it down to
drugstore style prices the better than
sex the my big thing with it is the the
clumpiness of it it definitely gives
more volume but then it increases the
clumpiness of my lashes so I find I have
to really wiggle it to get it to come
out and really you know make my lashes
not look like one big lash so that's my
only complaint about the better than sex
other than that it works very well for
me personally I really like that one a
lot
anonymous vlogger says do you need fix
plus if you have the Smashbox primer
water I've never used the primer water
for that purpose I don't think it's not
in my head but I mean I pretty much use
that stuff interchangeably Claudia says
I love the fixed plus I use it on my
face but it's only the regular one on
sale and office scented I wanted the
lavender one-step hi Stefanie Maureen
definitely check out Stefanie Marie's
youtube channel as well another great
channel she loves the fix + hug -
Stefanie Marie
Allison says fix+ is definitely Dewey
trying to find Sarah says the fix+ just
smell just makes me happy at the beauty
hub check out Sarah Sarah at the beauty
hub definitely check out her channel as
well
Maggie's leaving she's going to church
bye Maggie okay let me see what else is
people wear also people are saying about
this down below Annie says I do not like
the scent of a Smashbox primer water
want to try the new Smashbox primer
water with the set but not for $32 yeah
I can't pull the trigger on that either
Chris Anna all christina is here from
Chris Anna and cosmetics she says so
fix+ is good for dry skin
I don't know how hydrating it is I'll
have to if I knew exactly where well
actually I can look it up let me look up
the ingredients real quick mac fix+
ingredients I'm just looking to see if
there's alcohol in it because a lot of
that stuff has alcohol in it you see
Beauty pedia ingredients it looks good I
don't see any alcohol in it which is
good it's got glycerin which is a
humectant butylene glycol I'm trying to
remember off the top of my head what the
deal is with that cucumber fruit extract
which you know is one of those ones
that's kind of like some people say that
it's great some people say that doesn't
do anything the I don't know matric Aria
extract I don't know that
kamila census leaf extract I think
that's green tea which is really good
and then we get into things that are a
little bit smaller in concentration like
took a pharaoh acetate butylene glycol I
can't remember
see now I'm off topic here for a second
off topic I'm on top oh no I copied and
pasted the wrong thing hold on a second
now I feel like I have to look it up
because I I've started now I can't stop
I can't remember
polished choice which I always take with
a grain of salt was the first one I saw
seems like it's fine
similar to propylene glycol but as a
lighter texture it's a texture enhancer
I have to dig more and I don't want to
waste your time long digging but Amanda
says what do you recommend to help
understand ingredients in cosmetics
there should be a video in itself we did
do a chat about that actually we did do
I have some favorite websites what I
usually do is I have a website that I go
to as like a starting point and it is um
let's see oh no no no go back go back
no am I still live I hope I'm still live
okay good
I accidentally Oh No okay no I thought I
cut off chat okay let me let me do that
again
it's called cost DNA comm and I go to
their analyzed cosmetics tab and it
gives me the ewg ratings the
Environmental Working Group ratings to
see whether it's something I should look
up or not I go there I do a lot of truth
in aging is a really good site it's
scientists run so I really like that
website and what else try to think of
the other websites off the top of my
head I'm so tired I came in like I can't
even think of the websites that I use
there's one called a MEDLINE plus is one
that I was using for the vitamins that's
in my my bookmarks but mostly I just
kind of Google like let me go but let me
do that butylene glycol and see what
comes up polish choice I kind of take
with a grain of salt
what else do I look at Ann Marie Gani I
that that blog has kind of hit and miss
for me sometimes I find that they the
almost edge on the side of saying things
are scarier than they actually are
the Beauty Brains is a great blog blog
blog the Beauty Brains is a great blog
I'm trying to think I can't think I did
do a whole video on it if you look on my
youtube channel though about ingredients
and different websites that I use I was
purple I was uh
I was prepared for that one that
question then mr. Archer and says
polished choices biased I think that
sometimes they can be because they do
sell products I think that they do hype
up products that they personally use but
I also find that a lot of the
information that they provide is similar
to what I find on other websites so I
always just kind of double-check what I
learned from polished choice on other
websites to make sure kind of
everybody's ideas are the same so I kind
of take theirs with a grain of salt and
then double-check their information with
other websites to see if there's a
consensus there I think they're all
linked over on that other video and
polished choice goes on some really old
studies sometimes they do and that's the
problem with environmental working group
as well is sometimes they'll go on
studies that don't have like it'll be in
like 95 percent concentration and
they'll say no don't ever use this and
it's like but you're doing it 95 percent
concentration so don't freak everybody
out because we're talking about like a
point 5 percent concentration you know
what I mean so yeah but anyway I should
go it's six minutes after it's almost
seven minutes after and I gotta go take
my daughter to the store so thank you
guys so much for being here I appreciate
you and yeah I'm gonna go ahead and go
this week we've got a couple of good
videos coming up which I haven't even
film jet hopefully I'll be filming some
tomorrow tomorrow morning
a couple really good videos I have my
monthly favorites coming up and then I
have an a video I don't know if I should
say it cuz I know anybody's steal my
idea cuz I don't think anybody else has
done this I'll have to keep searching to
see if anybody else has done it someday
like it's like a little style video
let's just say that it's like a
commentary kind of video I'm actually
really looking forward to it so I'm
gonna go I say goodbye but thank you
guys so much for being here I appreciate
you mad love have a great week have a
great Easter if you celebrate we're
taking the week off next weekend for
