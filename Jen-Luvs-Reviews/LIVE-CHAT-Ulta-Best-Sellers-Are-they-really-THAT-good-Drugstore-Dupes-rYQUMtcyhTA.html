what's the make up chat from what I'm
understanding is it the first time I
tried to do this live chat it was not
working and now it's rendered and
sharing and being the other and we're
starting again but we read without the
start all over again
and if you're watching this on the
replay
I totally understanding this is a very
weird intro to the video because I think
I'm gonna delete the other one okay what
I'm going to talk to make sure that this
is live so if you are watching this on
the replay I will put a timestamp down
below of when the things actually start
and I stop troubleshooting so I don't
want to turn it off and then okay hold
on hang tight okay fix it I'm gonna fix
it
okay it looks like okay it's so weird
but I don't have a chat
what is hello because I'm in a different
video hold on a minute
okay I'm fixing it I'm gonna fix it
it looks like online though this is the
weirdest I've never had this problem in
chat I've been doing chat for what three
years four years I've been doing a chat
every Sunday and I've never had this
happen so I'm trying to find live
streaming I'm trying to refresh the one
you could collect afraid of maker boss
honest I can't do this without them
okay it looks like we're back and
hopefully it stays that all right we're
two minutes in let's go ahead and
restart so he hopefully it stays I'm
crossing my fingers all right so this is
where the video is going to start we're
starting now if you're watching somebody
play we're gonna be talking about the
Ulta brand bestsellers the things that
are listed as the most popular things at
Ulta and we did this for Sephora last
week this week we're gonna do it for
Ulta there are quite a few brands that
are different alter than Sephora they do
have some overlap but the things that
are their best sellers are quite
different so I think it'll be really
interesting to talk about those quick
disclaimer is very quickly this is a
live chat format so I will be talking to
people that are here a lot try if you
don't like that I'm really sorry but I
won't leave you hanging like if someone
has a great idea I want to say oh great
idea and then not tell you what the idea
was I will read it back to you the other
thing is they don't burn it up in this
video that bothers some people
I don't know why that bothers some
people but it does I stay up very late
on Saturdays trying to get the news
ready for you and I just don't I don't
wake up early to do makeup firm chat and
we don't need to wear makeup all the
time I think it's okay even for people
that create Beauty videos on YouTube I
think it's perfectly applied not to make
up all of the time
so those are my two disclaimers let's go
ahead and say hello again to the
collective brain of makeup awesomeness
second round the people that are here
live I'm gonna scroll back up to okay so
it looks like Lee is here so here we go
again turn on my phone on and off and I
can see how long the last oh my gosh you
know Lisa is here Maria is here and
Samantha is here and Judy is here and
iris here is my first time with you and
I has to work I can't have bad luck I've
set an alarm for this oh my gosh I'm
trying alright dry roses here and surely
serum Florrie one of our fabulous
reporters is here Maria and Alayna and
bam and faiza is here praise the Lord
hallelujah
yes um a sh Lee is here and beauty
beauty is here and swarupa is here and
grey dove and junebug smuggler Mercury
retrograde strikes again that's right it
is Mercury retrograde I think that did
that start yesterday or today I know it
was it's very recently bullsh
holy moly and hello to everything else
that I didn't say hello to and hello to
everybody that I said in the first
version of this chat hello to you okay
so let's go back and we're gonna rewind
and I'm gonna go back to my Ulta screen
you can find these by clicking on makeup
and then sorting by best sellers so the
first one today adds up today that is in
there for best sellers watch me after
all that is the Urban Decay Naked
palette i do have a full review on this
on my channel um it's for me you got to
think in your head do you like red on
your eyes and that's what I said review
do you like these colors do you like red
not these colors but do you like red
looks if you do and this may be
something you want to consider if you
don't then you probably don't want this
I love it from my collection because I
have all the naked palettes I want to
have all of them as you makeup reviewer
it's great to have all of them because
that I could find dupes for you for
example I just did my Jacqueline Hill
dupes video and I found that eight I
think it's eight shades in this boys are
12 year one two three four five six
seven
910 yeah out of 12 there's nine shades
in here that they're dupes for in the
Jacqueline homeworking pilot so what
you'll be missing out on our chaser loom
Bray or however you say this I say
lumber but I know that that's wrong
because if you get in corrected and
amber here those are the ones that there
are dupes for in the Jacqueline Hill
palette but if you on Jekyll pop out you
probably don't really need to get this I
mean they're nice enough shades they're
very unique but I don't feel like you're
gonna miss out on a whole lot from this
it's a good palette lasting power but
the power is good blend ability is good
I just find like I can't get a variety
of looks because it is so monochromatic
I find that I like just grab in one
shade from here and then use in other
palettes for that so the drugstore dude
for this with you the morphe Jaclyn hill
palette I think there are more if there
are more definitely leave those in the
comments below if you found any other
ones I've heard good things about the
color pop the new palette from them I
think it's is it yes please is that what
it's called I think that's what it's
called I've heard good things about that
one there I'm sure and it makeup
revolution is gonna come out with one or
at least something similar I haven't
seen any yet but you know Joey says my
daughter loves those colors but I think
they're too one too many warm palettes
out there but then again it's like
highlighter face I know and I think
that's starting to flip from the very
very warm we're trying it seems like
brands are trying to get more creative
and we'll get to that when we get to the
subculture palette I think it try to get
more creative in the color selection
which could be a good thing or not a
good thing
but to see and find out so yeah so naked
heat that is the number one selling
product at Ulta right now according to
their website so now we'll go on to the
next one that I already talked about in
the last month stream which was the a
cosmetic CC cream we talked about this
last week with the Sephora once it's
also a best-seller at Sephora I feel
like it cosmetics CC cream is one of
those things you don't really really
love it or you really don't like there's
something with it that does not work for
you this I do really like it's a kind of
a medium
coverage it's got SPF 50 in it but I do
like to wear an SPF underneath it like
I'll use an SPF moisturizer and then
I'll put this on top just because I feel
like I want more I don't know I don't
trust us yet in cosmetics is that weird
I just I'd rather do both you can't have
enough you can't have too much in my
opinion
SPF stuff so I do both for me I feel
like I wish they had a bigger range of
shades I'd have liked and medium usually
I have to mix the two right now I'm more
of a medium because no matter what I do
I always seem to be getting some kind of
Sun on my face in the summer but yeah so
these are good for me how does the
collective brain feel about them I would
love to know Chrissy says QVC has a
great deal with the CC cream by it
cosmetics great to know Carla is here hi
Carla
leave my friend it cosmetics it's great
but they need to expand the shade
selection oh I totally agree totally
agree okay here we go
Vanessa says oops I love the CC cream
but it makes me super greasy I have to
wear it in the winter it does have kind
of a luminescence to it it's definitely
not matte Maria Maria wants to know Lisa
says CC cream is magic Julie says I mix
the CC cream colors and finishes to get
the perfect coverage nice Jacqueline
says I love the CC cream when I first
tried it but after using it a couple
more times it just didn't do it for me
good Jacqueline says it also has a very
lemony scent I have never noticed that
it sure does
you know I never noticed that it has a
lemony scent I never noticed it so if
you're sensitive to scents this might
bother you because I can smell it on my
hand Wow
I'm just how much does it go for Tim
wants to know this is $38 hmm what I
said for deep for this for drugstore
would be the Garnier BB cream it's yeah
scar navy decree absolutely
art um was he
a bruh I'm gonna say era says I've never
tried it been curious for the longest
time but never like any foundation
doesn't matter the cover to the formula
nor BB cream CC cream on on me might
just make my mom try it
hey if you don't like foundation you
don't have to wear foundation it's
totally cool you wear what you want and
what you like if it bothers you you
should not be just don't don't push it
it's okay
save yourself some money man Christmas
says it's probably because of the citrus
oils I would imagine they're citrus oils
in there I think where does it lamp a
lemon lemon lemon lemon lemon something
I think you're right I think you're
absolutely right
Gail elects the Garnier and miss disgust
I don't like the Garnier had the best
coverage though really I felt like it
was comparable but it's been a while
since I've used it it's been a good
solid year since I ran out actually said
The Naked one and done it's a good
alternative in it doesn't smell bad you
don't like the lemon I guess that's the
same price for the toothpaste Born This
Way
yes which we will be talking about in a
second so let's go ahead and move on to
the next one which is the tart shaped
tape my shape take though I know it has
here oh here it is I was talking about
this when we when it stopped chart shape
tape is my favorite concealer that I've
ever used it's very hard to find YouTube
I feel rightly so I love this I love it
because I love the coverage of it I love
the doesn't crease on me I see a lot of
people that are really good they can
artist using this as primer I have tried
that did you not enjoy it as primer felt
like it did not work for me at all for
primer maybe I used too much I think I
need to just play a little bit more with
it but I do like this concealer it's my
feet and I hate to be on the bandwagon
on that one but I don't feel like I am
on the bandwagon because I genuinely
love this stuff Steph says shake tape
isn't Malou grail for me Starbucks fan I
love my shape tape Maria best concealer
ever mansion new shape tape seems very
heavy it's not as heavy as what we're
going to talk about in a minute there's
another one that's a little bit
but it is heavier compared to some other
concealers I would agree but I do feel
like um you know you can shear it out
and make it less heavy if you want to
but but yeah I would think that with the
coverage thing you know you need to have
it a little bit of heaviness to it in
order to get the coverage that you need
Anne says Jen thank you for being a
quiet drinker I typically put my
headphones but I know I can trust you're
sipping oh my gosh whooping I hate
hearing people chew and eat I don't mind
if you do it but like got that sloppy
sound which I'm not gonna make oh I hate
it I absolutely hate it so I'm totally
with you so good oh i princeton i do not
like the shape tape LOL again why am I
always the in the minority
I find it cakey and too much for dry on
their eyes but I'm old that's Kristin
vain if you're not following uh
subscribe to Kristin game you're totally
missing she's amazing but you got to
remember Kristin I have dry under eyes
so my experience is going to be
extremely different but if you have dry
under eyes I would trust Kristin and say
you might want to be there of the shape
too Melanie says can you shape tape as a
primer under eye shadow yes and I think
didn't I just mention I put that in the
last livestream that I mentioned that
her but I don't like it as a primer for
me it hasn't been working well but I
haven't played with it enough I think I
might have used too much but Krista so
she hates the shape tape to the coverage
is great but it cakes up on me no matter
what I use instead I use the benefit
brightening concealer and Becca off the
luminous concealer on top much better
combo missus says I would definitely
recommend setting shape tapered powder
which I do you were going to talk about
some powders Oh Maria says I look back
pretty even without makeup thank you
that's so nice of you and it surely
agrees with Krista interesting alright
so let's go ahead and move on to the
next one if you have said something
awesome makes you come back and type it
into the type it into the live chat in
that live shot oh my gosh can I speak
type it into the comments below so that
we don't miss out on your awesome ideas
so I cannot read all of them it goes too
fast
okay let's go to the next one which is
what we talked about a minute ago the
Born This Way Foundation I do have two
of these because I got them with FC
points and I don't know which shade I
would be I'd like beige and vanilla
I definitely lean more toward the
vanilla one I find about this is they do
seem to be a little bit on the orange er
sunlight or edgy side but when I blend
and I don't see orange as much as I do
when when it's like just swatched on my
hand what I do really love these
foundations especially as a more full
coverage foundation I don't feel like it
makes you look 1 this way I talked about
it last week I feel like it definitely
looks like you're wearing makeup but I
like it for filming I like it for like a
night out when I want but I don't mind
looking like I'm wearing foundation I do
really like it I mean really looking
forward I'm saying really I'm really
looking forward to the new foundation
that's coming out by Too Faced the peach
one from the new collection Katie says
she actually hates the Born This Way
Foundation hate hate hate you are
passionate Julie says I used it
yesterday and didn't like it Erin says
had just returned that because it clings
to my dry patches picked up naked skin
and set um Lisa says I hated Born This
Way too cakey on dry skin oh my gosh
there's some passion here Heather says
yes Born This Way is my holy grail and
cool toned and the paler shade is great
for me baby says worst foundation I ever
use
falls up with a prybar see everybody's
you know it's all of our different skin
types I'd swear it makes a difference
that's why you can't 100% tech trust you
- beauty reviews on foundations unless
you are watching someone that has the
exact same skin type of you then you can
trust it a little bit more but still
your environment makes a difference you
know your oil production and all of that
I mean it all makes difference so you
just have to try it for yourself and
just take your best guess based on what
here Carla says is born this way better
for oily or dry skin I will talk to the
community about that because we do five
normals in suraíh god I'm excited about
the new bare minerals foundation Vanessa
says
Keiji says I like the formula but born
this way but snow was too dark for me
has anyone tried Swan it's pretty pale
hmm Wow
so the witch call it dumb the palest
wasn't pale enough were you interesting
lisa says i feel like you're going to
love it or hate it
Jem was asking for suggestions for Barry
Kel scam what I would recommend is we
watch that Taylor from that Tayla she
has very pale skin yeah who I would
recommend you watch I can only speak for
me and I don't have very pale skin so I
can't get the best recommendations on
that Taylor would be your better back on
that AJ says I've always Skinner going
this way is awful well maybe it only
works for normal skin and it's a
best-seller at Ulta I don't know what's
going on here this is so weird I mean
look at some of the reviews here at Ulta
let's see let's see
rido saying it's her favorite I mean
it's got tons of really really good
reviews but the thing about reviews on
ulties that person has to take the time
to come back to review he says I'm in
camp 8:40 sleep Rose loves it nothing
likes a very pale skin is all yes
amber mix the NYX white foundation make
sure it goes with the patrol with the
Born This Way that's great to know thank
you so much for that suggestion lady
lady what's up I love Taylor at their
skin and what she recommends usually
works a nice okay so let's go on to the
next things we still have lots and lots
and lots of products to talk about the
next thing is the Urban Decay cosmetics
shadow box I wish I could show you
picture but this it says new but this
thing's been out forever I don't know
what is going on there I don't
particularly like the shadow boxes
because I feel like this the shade
selection is all over the place you can
do a quick google search of an image of
it or you can look on Ulta that's shade
that's it shake selections a little bit
odd for me I like Urban Decay shadows
sometimes
sometimes they are a miss for me I
haven't heard great things about the
shadowbox but it seems to have four and
a half stars on or they play on on Altos
oh no all right I'm going to move on to
the pur cosmetics four and one thrust
mineral powder foundation that's what's
that to me but you're a while ago I'm
not being paid by Pierre I been just
sent me a box of a few different things
to try and I do really like this it's in
I have it in light and it looks like
this and I'm really excited about this
it's a very very nice powder is it worth
2915 personally I really like the Rimmel
the remote the remote same app is
fantastic and the Milani powder is
fantastic I don't know if this is better
but those are ones that I insisted that
hard cam right away I'm not sure which
one but it is very good it's very good
but I don't know if it beats my
drugstore ones that I like a lot but
again I have on the skin so I have to
worry about real production coming
throughout to worry about sticking these
dry patches so that's why I don't really
review a lot of face powders and
foundations and things because I feel
like that I don't I'm gonna have the
best information for you on that
Gabrielle said I tried it making it what
have you tried because I'm not sure at
this point which one we're talking about
Vanessa says lorac and Miss guard on my
favorite eyeshadow formulas those are
both that's excellent choices maybe he
says I'm loving the balmes powder
foundation I really like that one too
cause I said the powder made me get
little white bumps all over my face boom
like dog no Marissa says I like the
Maybelline fit me Daniel powder
foundations can be hard to use for
textured skin ok great to know Monique
says Black Radiance plus setting powder
is great I use golden cashews Lauren
says July 22nd was this time to $18 the
Urban Decay shadow box moved up in the
bestsellers gotcha
that makes sense Lauren why that's up
there so high because it was so
discounted - Amy says I'm you selected
Rimmel powder by prefer them
one better yeah they're interchangeable
for me but that's good to know from your
point of view Isis is the Maybelline fit
me powder foundation that's really good
especially for lady's skin nice and this
one I don't know if this is considered a
powder foundation it says four and one
so I guess it's supposed to be
considered but it doesn't say oh it is
powder foundation wait a minute am I
talking about the right product now that
I'm thinking about it this is press four
and one pressed mineral makeup I guess
it yeah it has to be the same thing
because it's four and one if you only so
weird okay because mine doesn't say
powder foundation on it do they have a
pressed powder and then a mineral powder
foundation am i like going crazy here I
just want to make sure that we're
talking about the same product
yeah powder foundation I don't see that
they have another one that's just a
pressed powder that says four and once
I'm going to assume that it's the same
one if not this is the pressed powder
and that's a powder foundation but I
think it's the same one I wish oh my
gosh okay well where I think that it's
the same I'm gonna go with it it's the
same if it's not please leave it coming
in the comments down below
it is the powder foundation okay good so
starting to panic a little bit that I
was talking about the wrong product
alright let's go ahead and go to the
next thing you go back on my Ulta new
cheer okay I'm glad our connections
going well this is good okay Estee
Lauder Double Wear I don't have that
currently mine got old and I had to
throw it away I had a great experience
with I had great experience with Estee
Lauder Double Wear it was very good
coverage for me very long lasting for me
just so you know the one that's in the
compact is very different from the
regular Estee Lauder Double Wear they
have a double wear in a compact they're
totally different the one that compact
is not as good I don't recommend it at
all and I should like a lighter coverage
foundation but it seems to be a
completely different formula Rosen wants
to know how we find the best sellers in
the Ulta page you're going to go to old
sitcom you're gonna go to where it says
makeup and then sort by best sellers
that's how you find it and it traveled
it changes all the time
Molly says safe travels to Kristin Oh
Kristin's safe travels I missed where
you said you were leaving my where you
were going but safe travels to me but
yeah I've heard great things and I
recommended it for like brides that are
getting married my friend Grady was
getting married and she asked what
foundation she should use and I
recommended the estee lauder double wear
it's just there's fabulous for her on
her wedding day
Lisa wants to know if Double Wear is
good on dry skin I hopefully that
collective brain will be able to help
you on that Barrow says I loved Estee
Lauder Double Wear Christmas as I
thought back in the day it was great but
now there's so many better full coverage
foundations now that's very interesting
for us - thank you so much
pinkey says Estee Lauder Double Wear is
my go-to foundation love the coverage
wear and finish on my skin
Christie Christie says fine si edit at
t.j.maxx yes si and it supposedly went
out of business and I'm not surprised
just because I did not find no makeup to
be high-quality I don't know what they
were doing I feel like it had a good
thing going with the packaging I thought
they had a good thing going to be
advertising but the products were not
good in my opinion I did not enjoy any
of the products I tried to might try
three or four different products do not
like any of them they just weren't good
for different reasons
SP Fox says some people love Double Wear
some people hate it drying fast hmm okay
good to know and actually says use a
good moisturizer under the devil we're
here try good to know
all right let's move on to the next one
because it's already getting late but
we've only been on for 24 minutes I'm
gonna go the full hour
next up the Anasazi of Beverly Hills
Modern Renaissance palette this one has
a lot of hype behind it and I agree with
it a thousand percent if that were
possible I'm gonna say a hundred percent
because that's real
I guess this either there's a reason why
this is I mean why is set a thousand
percent because that I believe bothers
me that goodness not real it's not real
a hundred percent I agree with that I
find this how extremely easy to use you
have to tap off your brush because you
can't get some fallout of kind of mine
la fórmula where it's buried sauce you
just have to be careful that you don't
press too hard into the shadows but it's
definitely workable it's not scary as
far as how much moment like the
subculture which we'll talk about in a
minute but I love that i can just pick
you know light medium and deep and kind
of go with my look and be able to come
up with something good without being a
makeup artist or being particularly good
at cooking colors i can find great books
with this and i love it i think it's a
fantastic palette it's really fun to use
i find joy when i use it i mean that's
my true test with an eyeshadow palette
is if it makes me happy to use it when i
grab it i get excited about it it's kind
of like if you're you know you've fallen
in love when you just feel like that
person is right and you just have that
feeling you know and you don't can't
explain it you can't make it happen it's
just either there or it's not and I feel
like we tell it's like this I get that
feeling like I'm happy to use it and
that's when I know I've found something
that's really good for me and this is
definitely one of those products that's
very good from you know pigmentation is
great but ability is great and kind of
an elastic hair is great I got a
wonderful experience with his con and I
definitely recommend it if you like warm
tones shadows Melanie loves to make the
monomer thought so much good morning -
Julie rayon says hello first time in a
long time I made enough so glad you're
here Emily's here she doesn't have it
yet
Katie absolutely recommends the modern
Renaissance she's totally flips Katie
with all like Born This Way da a you
know she's got her pitchfork out and
everything but modern renaissance she
loves that's all of them um here Ellie
says mine is coming tomorrow
I use my altar or where it points to get
it I'm scared for all the color I'm used
to basic colors so what you're gonna do
okay I have it I have advice for you if
you use the basic colors if you're gonna
do your regular look and then just add
one of these colors in slowly you know
just get yourself into it so maybe use
you know some of these shades over here
and or yeah use some of these shades
that are here some of these lighter ones
because I feel like they're the least
scary at least for me and then when you
start feeling comfortable start kind of
moving that way but just pick one it's a
start and then move to two and three and
kind of ease yourself and KB's
my torch well friend I'm gonna sell it
um but but anyway modern Renaissance is
a definite definite recommend there's
very few people that I've met that do
not recommend a modern Renaissance I
think it's mostly people that don't like
one colors don't like the modern - ah
great it's just a personal preference
for shade but it's really good and Holly
says my favorite all-time on a saucepot
yes but it says I wish I could have
gotten the amrezy palette modern
Renaissance is just not a clergyman it
applies to me I heard great things about
the Emery's of color as well all right
let's go ahead and go on to the next
thing
next is the bare minerals complexion
rescue tinted hydrating gel cream
broad-spectrum SPF 30 I don't own that
so I can't speak to that next one is the
Stila stay all day liquid lipstick Stila
stay all day liquid lipstick is one of
my least favorite liquid lipsticks of
all the time it's so drying so drying
Erin wants to know how to use all the
bags I'm gonna just talk about that
really quickly just use one pick one
I'm you can put one and you like to eat
your look and put a little bit of the
dark one out in the outer corner you can
put it just slightly above your brow
bone and kind of blend it out which I
think looks very nice for something a
lady old you can even put them all over
the lid if you want something really
bold but I just use immediately on my
outer corner or like up in my crease
like some of these deeper lines up in
the crease or just right above the
crease that Jesse
lyndie says should I get them on around
sensitive so easily duped
I feel like it's better quality um
that's my opinion but if you find a dupe
that works well for you I would say
don't get it
so the sealing liquid lipsticks back to
that I do not enjoy those at all they're
extremely drying for me I don't like the
way they feel I don't like I just yeah
cracking exactly iris says I hate to see
a way to drive me crashed on my 30s lips
absolutely row says oh boy
Stacey says I just got one of those
Stila lipsticks when they had them on
sale for their lipstick they sell for
showed so cheap I like the formula off
Sun actually says I've drives me out it
ends up looking nasty on me that's my
exact
the problem if it's they are the colored
best Oh is my favorite I live but I find
Selah for me or gets probably throughout
the day and I find it doesn't layer well
where's some liquid lipstick you can
layer them over top of each other a few
times without it crumbling well it still
if you really can't do that yeah I don't
I don't like them
Mindy says Sheila stays all day in some
spots wears away in others Rachael
Sheila is just not good they can do
better a green mole mole a loves makeup
mine don't don't crap on my 30s lips
okay oh that's awesome I can't do it and
then oh no here we go Emily's supernova
says OMG i love the still liquid
lipsticks they don't crack on me well
you are among all of the people here on
Ulta with 4 stars that long is still a
liquid lipsticks you are not alone if
you love them I personally don't know
let's do bugs me it cosmetics CC plus
cream illumination I don't have that one
which exactly the same except for it's a
little bit pink I would imagine this one
would just be less mad where that one is
more like a satin finish this won't be a
little more illuminating I don't own it
I can't talk about it
subculture palette by Anasazi yeah I do
want to do a full review of this even
though there's like I mean everybody's
review this at this point but you know
my reviews are a little bit different so
I still want to review it I will tell
you though I really don't think we
should buy this that's my opinion
especially if you are not a makeup
artist if you are a makeup artist or you
are really good at makeup then that
would be the only people that I would
recommend this for this girlfriend I'm
having some issues and it doesn't have
to do with the fallout that has to do
with the colors and the way they blend
and the way they wear that's my issue
with it the fallout thing I can deal
with because you just have to be gentle
but I've had some issues with this and
at this point I'm not recommending this
it does have two and a half stars on the
OTB website but you never know and I was
watching you I was watching and they
were saying you know that people just
jumped on the bandwagon for the
subculture palette you know that they
see one of their friends or someone that
they know bashing it so then they bash
it
without really giving it much thought
and I do feel like that has happens I
mean you can tell when someone has
really thought about a review and
someone has worked very hard for review
and believe considered it by what they
say if people that haven't really
thought about it speak in very general
terms
well yeah it's it's not a lot of powder
and I'm gonna sit here I'm gonna swirl
my brush in to show you how much powder
and then I'm gonna talk about you know
it's just not good it's just not good
you know I just can't get to work it's
just not good okay but why give me more
give me more than I don't just give me
it's just not good you know I I don't I
don't really trust reviews like that I
feel like you know the reviews that I
trust are the ones that really seem like
that they've tried it a lot and they've
worked really hard to try to give it a
chance
the initial reviews when they're first
impressions or if they are said to be a
first impression that's one thing but
somebody that said they use the law and
then they give them them details except
for that it's powdery and they don't
like it I don't I don't trust that find
it with you so I'm gonna I'm gonna do a
pro review on this but I do have a Kat
Von D I'm gonna do this week the Kat Von
D the glimmer palette is coming up first
so hopefully by the time I get back to
circle around to this the hype have died
down a little bit and people will be
like okay we'll be okay with me giving
my opinion again because you know there
won't be such a old feed of subculture
palate reviews so it's one thing about
getting it a little bit later it might
be a benefit for me the beads won't be
so full of reviews row says yes
Stephanie Nicole's review is also
amazing I agree I really like
Stephanie's review of it our opinions
don't match 100% but I agree with a lot
of what she said there are some things
that we definitely did wrong no man
should be says all that fashion caused
me to buy it I actually like that it's
one of those things where you have to
just have to try it yourself yeah and I
think I agree with that but you do have
to try it yourself but I do have I still
don't recommend it to be honest and we
spur for unless like I said unless
you're a makeup artist or even legally
talented with colors and choosing colors
cuz it's been a hot massive experience I
have I haven't enjoyed it I don't I
don't get happy
xiety well but you know we'll talk about
it
Monique says Gemma's channeling
Flashdance day I so am I just gotta pull
the cord literal fall down on thing
have you asked over the water and
remembered Vincent lungs don't watch but
other scenes there many parodies of it
what up baby and then there you go all
right moving on that's good with the
next thing I love this sweater sweater
though it makes me happy I got it on a
vacation where we had just we were over
at my husband's this is a very fast way
we were over at my husband's parents
house to my husband's father is still
alive and Little John was a tiny baby
and my husband was like I just want to
go to the village like we don't have
anything I don't even want to go to the
beaches that I just want to go to the
beach let's just go to the beach oh look
we have a baby and we have no clothes we
have no luggage should be something
about that he's like let's just go so we
went to the Jersey Shore and what's the
beach and we had nothing we had no
changes of clothes but anyway moving on
next I'm too faced better than sex
mascara $23 for that I do like the
better than sex mascara I don't think
it's worth $23 I feel like the drugstore
mascaras just one thing I've said a
million times I'll say it again I don't
feel like it's that uh high-end mascara
is it worth the money
hardly ever there's very few that I feel
like make enough of a difference I don't
feel like to base born to base better
than sex is one of those from me
personally I have very short sparse
lashes my lashes are basically nothing
and I feel like the better than sex baby
nice length nice volume but nothing
outstanding nothing that makes me just
go but even I mean it's a good mascara
it's good but it's definitely not like
mind-blowing for me I've had so many
people yeah here we go
row says oh dear god I hate that mascara
and Gordon says I can get clumpy yeah
and I like I like the clunkiness
absolutely you have to really
plumpie it definitely absolutely to NASA
hates it Sabrina says I like it too but
I don't think it's worth $22 agreed
surely woohoo Laurie eyelash paradise
we're gonna get to that in a second
L'Oreal Paris we're gonna get to that in
a second Caroline says it's my holy
grail mascara that is awesome and says a
loss and oh no I lost her yeah missing
something there she is
Too Faced better than sex mascara like
like late father I mean she wants care I
came there without wearing eyeliner have
you tried the essence ones the essence
last princess ones are stupid bad Yuri
says I can't find a judge for cruelty
free options I love the water cook
better than sex I'm pretty sure Jordana
is cruelty free is Jordana physically in
my mind I'm thinking that it is if it is
then get Jordana best lash extreme but
now I'm thinking that they're owned by
Milani and adopting how long each Prince
approve and now somebody who's
somebody's going to know but but if if
Jordana is cruelty free I definitely
recommend that one let's see baby says I
really love the more qubits for high-end
I like that one but it still wasn't
fabulous and then for me at least for my
lashes I'm not negating your experience
at all because all her lashes are very
different grade up says I love it that
I'm reaching for my it's superhero more
clearly if person game is still here
when I met Christine game
she had the it cosmetics superhero mask
they're on and I had to look twice
because I thought she had fake lashes on
they look so good on her and when I got
it it said like it was fine but it
wasn't great on me and I was so
disappointed because I one of my lashes
they look like first things and they
just didn't they just sent which essence
mascaras back I like the last princess
for me I can use the green one and the
pink one interchangeably I ever said I
thought Milani and Jordana with the same
company they are they're owned by the
same company Jordana diamond which by
Milani which is cruelty free yeah you
guys go get your Sussman Jordana best
lash extreme yes so target cells essence
nights only seen it at my local target
but haven't we been
all right let's move on to the next one
because we're at 37 minutes and only
tell you so much more okay this one I'm
so surprised to see this as one of their
top sellers oh my gosh how I love this
is it still available it says you have
to click wanted to make sure that you
can even still buy this thing yeah it
says on tobacco okay so this is the
lorac beauty and the beast' pearl
eyeshadow palette it's $48 it does come
with a double-sided brush oh my gosh I
love this I love this palette it makes
me so super happy I love the colors in
it is it anything mind Welling and
different now it's not my feelings
effect I'm trying to think if there were
any it's been a minute since I've used
it this shade on the wheel you is really
pretty this this pink it's got a little
bit of a um a sparkle in it a little
silver sparkle it's really pretty but if
you're looking for a nice natural
palette and you love this if you love
like this book style I would definitely
recommend it it is a little bulky for
some people that don't like that
Lori says 20% off coupons are out check
your emails yes thank you for you for
the reminder because older does have a
24/7 upon it for sign up for their email
but I am I've decided in my heart that I
want to collect makeup outs that look
like books so this is one that I'm
getting that I have that I decided to
get because it went with the rest of my
collection so like I thought about
Pirates of the Caribbean I feel like
that will channel to the book and Alice
them Wonderland palette and I really
want to get the Charlie and the
Chocolate Factory tell it by storybook
cosmetics I want that so bad
so I'm definitely getting that but this
one here back to this one after that
stop talking about me I'm talking about
me I love that it's got this pretty
little mirror here oh this is a
magnifier body I think so it sometimes
it sticks in there but this is it's it's
very boring if you own a lot of
eyeshadow palettes if you own the Too
Faced natural lucked out you probably
don't need this because it's very
similar in color selection for that but
it's so pretty
it says true beauty as founder and it's
just one of those again it makes me
happy it makes me happy in my heart but
again dreamy
you don't need it roses Jen thanks Jen
you're tempting you so hard for this
thought you don't need it Rose you don't
you really don't need it but it is very
good quality and it is very fun to use
and it makes me happy I love this shade
romance I know it looks very ordinary
but mixed with these shades over here
it's just so free you get so many pretty
looks this shade be snowed this blue is
really cool it's just like a deep royal
blue and I've put it on the bottom
lashline with the pink lip on the top
like pink and brown on the top and then
the blue on the bottom it's Elana says
what do you think about lorac me
releasing their mega pros I am very
thankful that people get to get the
original mega Pro palette because there
was a video game
stink over that when that came out I
don't know if you remember that that was
years ago a lot of you probably do think
that a lot of you probably do remember
it because you've been around for a
while but the original mega Pro it was
only available on like Amazon and Lorax
website for like an hour and then it was
gone and it went away forever and it was
terrible
a couple people are telling me that I
froze I see a very good live streaming
home so I'm hoping if you go back out
and come back hopefully it'll be neat
better oh no but yeah I'm thankful they
released it because it's a fabulous
palette it really is it's very very very
very good and I definitely recommend
picking it up their original Moroccan I
propose my favorite Katie says the best
summation of white collection isn't out
yet but if you go to their page you can
see it and it looks great I love best
and I bought their lipsticks when they
first came out and I'm addicted I really
like the best make vanilla setting
powder that one's really really nice
Stevie Stevie's girl Lee says I want
storybook Cosmetics ink liner they're
coming out with I'm thinking about
getting that two of them thinking about
it but it's like I feel like I would
have to display it it's so beautiful and
it's expensive
just uh from Justin v UT is here hello
which she check out her YouTube channel
it's very very good okay I gotta go over
to the next thing because I'm gonna run
out of time it's already almost 11
o'clock okay the next one is the
bareMinerals original foundation
I've never tried that so I can't talk
about it and the next one is the Benefit
Cosmetics they're real lengthening
mascara all right this was my experience
with the bareMinerals
okay I'm gonna pack this one out I put
it on oh I like that
you know that's some nice fast-forward
to 10 hours later alright let's take off
our makeup and take it to makeup remover
why is it my mascara coming off my
mascara is just running all over my face
but it's still on my lashes my lashes
are crunchy why won't it come off this
is terrible we're seems to rip out
lashes by accident this is awful it
won't come off that was my experience
with the benefit mascara it was awful
they do have a now up specific remover
for it but it's not worth it I have very
little tiny bits of lashes and I cannot
risk losing them I can't risk losing
them so I used it a couple of times and
then I just stopped using it because I
couldn't I can do it Robin says oMG yes
the same thing happened to me yes mazes
OMG I hated but they're real mascara is
so clumpy I don't remember being clumpy
but again it's been a long time for me I
just remember it just maybe says that's
what happened with my waterproof flash
paradise yes this one says coconut oil
really helps getting it off nice I think
I can't remind me I was just using and
eye makeup remover at the time it just
says you deserve an Oscar award-winning
reenactment oh my gosh I know right I'm
such a pro such a pro but yeah no no on
that one
Carla says I need a mascara for
sensitive eyes recommendations are very
short thin lashes that are barely there
I don't have sensitive eye so I hate to
recommend something to you without
knowing the collective brain might be
able to help you Elizabeth says the
makeup remover burns my eyes I think it
just depends on the brand some of the
others were in my eyes - Niki Murphy
what
if you like someone that's real like
down-to-earth you gotta check out Nikki
Murphy Murphy Murphy and I K I am you
are he hy she's like as real as it gets
she's awesome maril who okay let's go
onto the next one well Rob speak and
we're off mega Pro we got the lorac mega
pro 3 palette I got it right here look
how dirty this thing is oh my gosh is
dusty we to see the inside
Jessica that beauty said L'Oreal I
makeup remover or a Lancome bye bye
facial is the most it's amazing they
took mascara off nice thank you so much
that I appreciate it
alright here we go dirty filthy
disgusting looking oh my goodness okay
I'm pretty sure that there is a coating
you can put with a flat with a light
plastic coating with an put on cardboard
to make it doesn't get like this I
suggest that you box I think more thing
needs to do it with the Jackman no Paula
to have gotten one is getting disgusting
for me this works it grosses me out so I
honestly don't reach for this because
when I look at it I felt because it's so
gross looking at this point I just I
don't reach for it anymore if that's not
enjoy it for me to look that long how
sad is that I am going to keep it though
because it is part of my lorac mega pro
collection the shades are great I do
feel like they overdid it
over here if these colors are too
similar for me they're good but they're
too similar okay they bury it up a
little bit but it is nice Lisa says you
can laminate it I think it's a little
too late unfortunately but I always
applied for your vinyl to a contact
favor book cover if I if I thought of
that before it's a little too late and
the thing is too is it's the inside too
it's this part versus now I haven't
really spent a lot of time trying to
clean it though plastic packages with
this piece of my face if I get it
out like this again I'm still doing that
oh my gosh well not layer if I they said
you can laminate pilots I don't think
running it through a laminator I think
they're like you press it on like almost
like um the contact paper or you press
it on and you cut it to size so Anderson
did you see the going on the rock mega
Pro neither one healed for anyone else
it has it killed for me yeah Todd says
you have to get clear contact paper at
the dollar store yup mm-hmm
yeah he says I went out and bought the
plastic when I got the White Rock hot
yeah no CD I should have done it too I
should be rented over because I'm a girl
but if this was my own like if I had
invested my didn't invest money in it
but if this was my only pallet choice
because I didn't have a big collection I
would probably still be using it uh
Lindy what I'd love if you would do sure
I get the jaclyn hill or morphe 35o is
skip to the end of my jaclyn hill dupe
video it's not the 35 oh I have the 35
OS and you're 35 om which is a mix of
both of those the 35 o is a mix of the
shimmer and the matte one I have this
shimmer and matte and separate palettes
but look at the shade comparisons and
then decide
I personally if I had to recommend to
you I would say get the jacket home over
anyone for 35 OS I like the formula
better but if you want to see it then go
the under that video there Jack and good
dupes video that I just put out alright
let's go to the next one because we have
12 minutes left and I want to do more I
totally forgot to get that out we talked
about that last week that there are so
many good drugstore tips for the Anasazi
of growlers the Loreal one the next one
brow pencils overall like the twist up
ones are a terrible value if you are on
a budget I do not recommend you ever buy
a twist up I'm sold because there are
literally thousands of dollars per
program product like any art part yeah
per gram of product I mean it's
ridiculous
you get like point zero zero zero one
grams and a gram is not a lot so you do
not get a pencil that's not a roll up if
you want one to last you a long time but
if you do want to roll up one the Loreal
one of the necks
they're just as good the only thing I
would recommend me honest kasnia one for
is it can have a color of hair that they
don't make any other ones or yeah posing
pretty go to mix so you should be get a
picture next oh wait next parent company
I think isn't cruelty free so then you
go to Osaka if you're that lovely
cruelty prettiness since it says not a
fan switch it up contours out the third
brow powder yeah absolutely absolutely
Emily says well so what is a cheaper
option for brows brow powders are
definitely better or pencils that don't
roll up you get a lot more product or
brow gels Val yells to but I would say
powder is definitely the best option for
less expensive Monique says my son just
completed his finance degree this week
now I must go so you can put my shelves
together oh that's so awesome to me I'm
not sure if you've heard this before you
go I'm not sure you've heard this before
I got caught off before but you're
talking about that you wanted the really
send me then if you don't take it I do
how to get away coming up and there is a
brand new maybe even giveaway so make
sure you underneath anyway and congrats
to your son very much Congrats Congrats
for me Lisa - that's so exciting so
exciting there's times in your life
these things and I so did you say you
like the a BH brow powder it's good but
I don't think that that's one you have
to have I think there are a lot of brown
eyeshadows or whatever for their Harry's
eyeshadows are good enough for a brow
powder alright let's go to the next one
dose of color is a liquid lipsticks
fabulous fabulous baggage baggage where
I was like Cielo
these are fabulous and reason why I like
these is that they are a little more
drying than the OSHA ones but the
staying power on these oh very good they
layer really well and they have a little
bit of staining to them so when they do
it away you still have a little color on
your lips which is fabulous
and ma puce the do is a color with the
lipsticks I'm doing I really really like
them but they are a little dry so if you
really need that hydration I don't
recommend them but if you don't mind a
little bit of a dry form a lot these are
my favorites so
because the lasting power is so good
it's so good the enemy says AVH gravis
breaks me out benefit for me nice
Christina says seriously I've got the
unstyled brow pencil I wrote it up all
the way and wonder where the rest of it
was I know it's crazy that one says I'm
lusting so hard for the desert 80 club I
need to watch on christine's with you
brought me to Crystal's with Nordic mama
Shauna says brow powder lasts for
lifetime oh please not true
Diane says if you tried to do some
polish standard lipsticks yeah they were
just gonna think for me they're good
good good I don't want to work that
price though I need to try more of them
though I could have one too two of them
there are five fine but these are good
these are definitely alright movie says
quality objectors star without the
jeffree star there you go I've never
tried Jeffrey started a lipstick so I
can't speak to them but that's really
funny but that's me good to know good to
know
alright Mac Mac fix plus is up there mac
fix+
if you know me you know that I don't
like to spray them to my face I've never
used this as a setting spray ever what I
use this for is to let my brush with the
shadows so I get my brush in the shadow
and then I spray a little bit this on
and it makes it more coffee in my Urban
Decay Naked palette video you can really
see how this works in action in the demo
and to show you how much punchier you
can get your shadows to be using this
you can use water but I feel like this
works better as far as making it last
longer I feel like with the water it's
just okay where this is really great
all I need is this little tiny where I
think it was 10 bucks on that for the
little one and I think it's totally
worth it for the small one if you're
just gonna let your gosh if you're going
to strain all over your face and use it
as a setting powder or if your makeup
artist then definitely get the big one
but I feel like if you're just using it
to what your brush is the small one is
it is plenty that's just my opinion
see Jenny says I'm waiting for the car
pop at ulta that's my go-to lip products
he's sad to say they're not coming to
alter what pop is not coming to alter
it's in the news if it ever will ever go
live you see what percent we're at we're
at 87% on uploading but pop is not
coming to Ulta you know it's so sad just
that that beauty says mac fix+ is
amazing if you hate to spray in your
face to set spray on a beauty blender
and cream sponge and talking on the face
gently the sky Thank You Jessica this is
why I'm not just gonna just the YouTube
channel it's fabulous jane says I don't
know what it is about setting sprays and
make me feel like I'm in spa anything
else go that way I don't it makes me
feel like I'm spraying something in my
place that's my my thing I mean but some
people I mean people will sit out in the
Sun and they'll felt like the block of
spray water on their face okay do me
that it feels gross to me I can't even
color pop is going to support I believe
in November yeah I'm not coming at all
time sorry Shirley says would love to
colored helped to come out with regular
lipsticks the pencils are so creamy I
could just imagine the lipsticks yeah I
mean I like the color pop lipsticks the
the litany sticks I really like those I
know tabatha got uploaded already I now
it says it's about 20 minutes left for
the upload but then it has to render
after that and I don't know how long
it's going to take for rendering Andrea
says Polly has the best setting spray
I've tried that one that one I've
actually tried and Linda said what's
your favorite way to set your face I use
setting powder so I'll get like the bare
minerals or Laura Mercier and I'll take
a dense brush and pack it into my skin
and that's my favorite way Krista said
that'll let the Smashbox primer water in
the settings right I've heard good
things got that I'll be from me
dreamcatcher is here oh she's a no hey
I'm usually sleeping too much for these
Sunday Chad's got got to an early
birthday lunch day so even though my
birthday's smart happy birthday to be
yeah I'm not do you hear me
thanks for dropping by I appreciate you
all right next up MAC lipsticks I went
on a lot of MAC lipsticks what did you
like them oh they do have a sense
like a vanilla you find your son
I personally really like the scent but I
can see why people wouldn't and that it
would be bothersome for people with
scents entities who they do find that
they linger on the lips for a little
while
not for a long time but for a little
while I do feel like they linger for at
least 20-30 minutes after I put them on
but I don't own a lot of them because
they're expensive and I don't I don't I
don't know I feel like I gravitate
toward a lot of matte lipsticks
they're very creamy formula wives I
personally like the lustre finish I know
that's kind of weird they're likely
lustre finish and what else the satin
finish I'm like but I mean I'm not as
big of a fan of the matte finish ones
just because I feel like they lay here
like they're there to Matt's for me I
don't know like I just don't like that
look on me and is that she knows not
hooks and vanilla is a sex worker says
Nadine says she finds them really drying
I find that the ones that lustre finish
ones are not don't seem to be as drying
to real chick says MAC lipsticks are way
over there that lot has many dupes and
the quality is better I might have to
pull with Revlon lipstick that I like
but they're like a really scrub to kind
of get them on but they're good AG chick
says she isn't doing anything back but
yeah I mean I'm like MAC lipsticks are
they like he involved alchemy no not for
me personally but I think see why people
would really really like them alright we
are almost at a time you've got about 4
minutes left 3 4 minutes left and I do
want to get to the l'oreal lash paradise
which is one of the ones that's coming
and i want to get to the next one at
least the next two so this one i really
like for drugstore mascara it's not my
favorite drugstore mascara ever but i do
really like it I don't find that it
flakes or smudges or any of that on me I
don't know a lot of mascaras that smudge
on me for my particular laughs is my eye
dropper typically watery or anything but
I do like the way that this applies it's
good it's good I like the original
L'Oreal voluminous a lot I think I might
like this one just a tad bit
but not a lot better you want to really
like with the butterfly mascara I like
that one better than this one but this
one's good
it is really good I like it badly that
you faced better than sex I don't find
it to be as comfy as could she face
better than sex
that's just me personally asking says my
phone alert me that what's the make up
is up now what it's to me it says 90%
uploading oh that's weird
and you would get an alert that it's up
pilot says nope leaves the worst film
least the waterproof sherry says I agree
Mackey's drugstore quality and it
doesn't even have pretty packaging
L'Oreal is better at interesting
Lindy says what's your favorite drugs to
our lipstick friends mm mm oh I like the
Burma lipsticks they're more Airy fairy
is a good one Alec Maybelline
we've only mix their lips but I honestly
I feel like high-end lipstick is
something that I would pay more for
because I like that creamy texture so
like I really like Marc Jacobs lipsticks
and then it's Halloween oh no it says
offline
okay is it working but it says offline
okay you guys see me that's so weird it
literally says offline on my screen but
it's working that's so weird it says off
loadings are tied to your channel to
find it go to video manager
this thing is so weird
okay alright
that's so weird okay I went off and back
on because okay it says it's working I
don't know okay I have one more thing I
wanted to talk about and it would be it
cosmetics bye bye under-eye this one I
feel like is extremely intense okay it's
extremely intense it's very very very
thick it does seep into my fine lines
just a little bit but the coverage is
insane so I would recommend this more
for blemishes and things like that
rather than concealing the under eye it
is markedly retrograde oh my gosh this
is a horrible the internet is crazy oh
my gosh but anyway this good for
blemishes not so good for under-eye
that's what I'm trying to say Diana says
dry dry dry for my under eyes and
geneious says bye-bye under eyes is
horrible for me I know all the wretched
muttering much of it yeah but it does
crease exactly so I really don't think
you know it's bye-bye under-eye I feel
like it's good it's better for covering
other kinds of discoloration you know
you just pour it on your face blending
that in I don't like this as much for
the under-eye it is very thick you have
to use just a tiny tiny bit is it drying
no I wouldn't say it's dragging like I
don't feel like it dries out my skin but
I do feel like it dries you know like it
it kind of ends up looking flesh like
it's kind of clash not that it cracks
but it just it's very very intense
ok looks like we're good ok was that the
last thing I wanted to talk about
probably I better go before this thing
cuts off on me but again if you want to
check out Altos bestsellers and see
what's currently best-selling you just
go to old sitcom go to makeup and then
sort by bestsellers and that's how you
can find it but I want to thank you guys
so much for being in chat thank you for
putting up with me through all of the
craziness today what to the makeup
should be live very very soon it says 12
minutes remaining on the upload but then
it has to render so I don't know how
long the rendering is going to take
usually that takes about 5 to 10 minutes
so hopefully by by 12 o'clock it should
be up and I do apologize for the delay
it was I said it to upload last night
before I went to bed and I woke up and
it was still at 13%
something happened so I tried to restart
it and it's been uploading since 8
o'clock this morning so eight nine-ten
alone for over three hours at this point
like I've done doing everything I can to
get it up it's been ready and I'm very
upset but it's not ok but keep an eye
out make sure that you come back and
thank you so so much for being here I
appreciate you and then also now it says
live stream health is good stream is
continuing so here when I really
appreciate you being here in live chat I
hope you're enjoying it if you have any
ideas for future live chats I'm
definitely open to suggestions you can
leave those in the comments below the
video once the video renders which means
it's like it's a formatting for YouTube
so once it does that it takes about 20
20 to 30 minutes for that to happen come
back and leave suggestions for future
chats anything that you've shared if you
were in live chat and did not get a
chance to so if I didn't read it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
