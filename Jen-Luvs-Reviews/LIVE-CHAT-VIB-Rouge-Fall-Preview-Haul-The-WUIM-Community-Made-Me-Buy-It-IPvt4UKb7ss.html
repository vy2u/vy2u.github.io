how's everybody doing all right so
welcome to the ones in the makeup chat
I'm so happy to have you guys here we
have an issue in that I have to go back
old-school to my regular webcam right
for whatever reason my computer is not
recognizing my 1080p web cam I don't
know what is happening and I'm so mad
and that's why I'm a couple minutes late
so hopefully you can hear me okay
hopefully you can see me okay because
I'm not here still working in this go
ahead and go over to the collective
brain and make sure you guys can see me
and hear me before we go ahead and start
and I'm so mad because this I think is
really important to have in like the
best qualities i'm going to be showing
you swatches and different things like
that can you guys hear me okay however i
see a lot of people saying hi but um can
you guys see me and hear me I mean it's
really okay it's just okay everybody can
see me hear me alright so good everybody
saying that hello everybody okay so I
just I'm really upset because I want to
show you what I got from the vib rouge
sale but at the same time it's like I
have this terrible quality and I
hopefully you can hear me okay all right
oh thank you so much for for compliment
me on my shirt Ling I appreciate that
all right I'm going to take a second up
actually before I could say hello i just
want to we're going to be chatted about
today so to chat was a little late today
we started at 12 instead of 10 because i
wanted to have plenty of time to go to
the vib rouge event at my local Sephora
i went i got an email into my inbox and
it said i had to pre-register in order
to go to this event and the event
basically was a pre-launch of some
different fall items some of them i knew
about and one of them i did not know
about so of course i had to buy actually
a couple of them i didn't know about so
I of course I had to buy them because
they wouldn't let me i walked in i was
good i asked the manager I said can I do
social media in the store today and she
said well what do you want to use and I
said I want to use periscope on these
Instagram she said no of course there's
tons of Instagram photos all over
Instagram right now of people they
didn't ask and took pictures on
Instagram so
and get curious to know the products
that were there at the sale all you got
to do is go over to Instagram and go on
hashtag vib rouge there's a ton of
pictures that other people put up but
none of them were put up by me because I
asked permission I was told nuh so
without further ado I'm going to say
hello to the collective brain of makeup
awesomeness also known as people who are
in chat today participating live I
appreciate you being here but I also
appreciate people watching on replay
thanks so much for being here let me go
ahead all the way up to the top and it
looks like it's not showing you the very
first people that were here because the
first comment I see it snakes honey tell
us saying hi to Kelsey so hello calcio
hellos names honey hi sherry um she's
you guys were already talking when this
came up so now I feel bad because they
like to say hi to the first people that

going to go ahead and scroll all the way
down to the bottom if I did not say
hello to you I'm saying hello to you now
hello and welcome I know it's very
rapper roomy but um you know that's what
I got that's what I got and I apologize
I see somebody singing audios a little
laggy I mean at this point I don't think
there's anything I can do about actually
there may be something I can do about
the audio very quickly let me test
something it will only take a second so
if you're waiting for the whole hang
tight i'm going to try using my studio
mic and see if that helps with the audio
so let me just get a little plug ething
and you guys can tell me whether it's
good or not and if it's not good if you
audio is not good then we will stop it
immediately so I'm going to try it right
now okay how we doing does that sound
better first live chat for Heather
fantastic
have you here Heather that's awesome I
know Wendy I always very wrong a roomie
I know okay um the studio mic I used as
a road Mike looks like this right okay
sound is better okay great sounds the
same their sound is good okay well we'll
just leave it plugged in much better
okay all right we'll just leave it
plugged in hopefully it's working when
we flip over the video cam make sure
we're good on video and again i
apologize for the quality i'm really
upset about it but I wanted to come on
and show you stuff so we're going to go
ahead sounds perfect yay first time here
for crystal hello crystal and audio
sounds but ok so let's go ahead and go
into what I got this morning so I went
in not knowing what was going to happen
i had no idea i ended up going coming
out with a bag like this the first thing
i want to show you is a little bag that
they gave us as a gift to being there
myself i have you open it yet it's just
a little makeup bag is very cute it's on
like rubberized kind of it's very um I
don't know like a rubbery feeling oh no
um and it's just a nice little one
compartment bag so there you go I know
you need rubber room in a good way back
to you Jenn um yeah okay so if you're
having trouble with the video or audio
definitely hit refresh so I think this
is a really cute little bag up very
thankful to have and then the next thing
that I got was my birthday gift this is
the Marc Jacobs beauty insider birthday
gift which I haven't opened yet so you
get a little eyeliner Marc Jacobs
eyeliner in black and then you get a
little lipstick I'm showing the least
exciting things first cuz you know we
got save the exciting things and then
this is a little lipstick so it's very
tiny and cute but I'm excited about it
I'm excited to have as I do like the
formal of Marc Jacobs lipsticks
definitely so the big draw there was the
urban new Urban Decay lipsticks and I
should watch them and ice watch them and
ice watch them and really only one color
called to me and I can't collect me
remember what it was called but it was
like a newbie brown it's one that I have
like 50 million of that shade
kind of remind me of the Marc Jacobs
formula it was very very creamy
pigmentation was good i don't have any
stains left on my hand just from rubbing
it I don't any stains in my hand so I
don't think they're going to have like a
really strong staying power what did
have a strong same power that ice watch
where the two-phase new melted lipsticks
the ones that are in the the into the
squeezy tube there like in the bottle
that really stained my hand the one that
I did the purple one so um but the vice
lipsticks they just seem like regular
lipsticks today except for the fact they
seem very hydrating one thing I did want
to let you know as I was standing there
nexus one when we got in this
conversation she was like this one is
really sheer it looked very pink it had
glitters in it and it said sheer on the
bottom but I want to warn you if when
you see the sheer ones for those urban
decay lipsticks make sure that you know
that you probably will get no color
payoff if like the tiniest bit of any
all to be mostly that glitter so thank
you Anning she said she likes my shirt
ok so I just wanted to let you know
about that also the beach kits the one
that has the Sun savers kit was like
flying off the shelves they could not
keep them on the shelf so if you want a
hot item that is one everybody that's
reaching for let me show you what I got
so the first thing I thought that was
very much an impulse buy because the
woman at the store sold me on it she
gave me a little sample on my head and I
was like oh my gosh it's amazing this is
a clinique pet start hydro blur
moisturizer and when I put this on my
hand I am not kidding you it felt
silicone base but his water base it felt
so good on my skin I felt cooling it
felt Boyce rising and hydrating and I
was like oh I just fell in love with it
and I don't know why I got it honestly
except for that it was an impulse buy
and I couldn't help it and it definitely
blurred like the pores on my hands as i
did it like it was like oh what is that
who are you and can i keep you like I'm
just really excited about it so I got
this on an impulse buy so I'll keep you
posted on this let me smell it for you
real quick Lynn says my shirts from
golden so it was from golden so you have
a good memory Lynn oh my gosh look at
this it's like and if you can see that
but it reminds me of like vanilla
pudding as far
the texture like the cooked vanilla
pudding with the real cook vanilla
pudding that's what it looks like and it
has a very very very mild motion sent
but it's not bad it's not that at all
and it just feels amazing on the skin
and it does seem to onblur imperfections
so I decide happy early birthday thank
you so much i have a sahaja sent me a
present that I haven't opened I've been
very good and I have not opened it Lin
says her daughter has the same one and
white nice the the moisturizer is called
the Clinique kept start Hydra blur
moisturizer and I'm telling you it
definitely blurred the imperfections on
my hand it was very very interesting so
I'm curious to try that the next thing
that I got was another one that I was
not planning on getting and that is the
corral by benefit oh this was 2950 is
how much this was the cabrillo by
benefit she said that it's really good
and all the stuff and she sold me on it
and I got it so we'll see it reminds me
a lot of the Anasazi a dip brow as far
as the as far as a formula it comes with
this little brush and it's very cute the
packaging is adorable i can get it open
tell it's brand new okay there we go i
was scared us going to use my teeth or
something humph glad I didn't okay so
it's got the little brush in here which
i think is really nice that they
included a brush because not everybody
has an eyebrow brush and it goes in just
like the dipbrow not is opaque as the
dipbrow but that might not be a bad
thing it might not be a bad thing at all
because it might the chart someone say
that it's echoing it might be echoing
because the quality is just not going to
be as good for this video unfortunately
I feel bad I can't fix it and I'm sad so
I'm sorry I'm really sorry if it's
bothering him but it's definitely not as
opaque but I think I'm okay with that
because really okay constraining browse
sometimes are very hard to school out so
I'm not going to cry about that this one
is in the shade number six is the
darkest one it's nearly black it's
nearly black but the one that was a
little bit later than this was too late
for me so all right I'm going to gently
put this back in but that was the second
thing that I bought um
the quality is worse because I could not
get my on my webcam to work that's why I
came on a couple minutes please I was
trying to fix it and I just put it I
couldn't fix it so I apologize brow
pencil Ilana says just can't justify
anything more than two dollars and I
don't and there's lots of great products
you can get 42 I love my loreal brow
stylist that's that's my favorite right
now and that's 10 bucks so we'll try on
beautyleg know how this is my
four-year-old son says you're pretty oh
thank you so much 30 and then Jensen the
benefit might be better for people who
don't want instagram browse it's exactly
and that's why I wanted to try it so
slightly muffled yeah I don't I'm sorry
the cream I'll say again this is the I
don't mind saying I'll stay at 15 times
the Clinique peps start hydro blur
moisturizer and when this video is over
I'll type everything in the description
down below so um so there is that and
then there is this and then how much was
that let me look on my might and my own
Chrissy here so the benefits the Cobra
was twenty-four dollars twenty-four
dollars so the next thing that I got
let's see we'll show you this next this
is the Kevin a quan neo bronzer and this
is in the cool tone shade I'm just
making sure I'm not missing anything in
the chat Chrissy says I like the elf
brow kit with us with the whacks on one
side and the powder on the other I think
it's four dollars I mean there's so many
Braille products that are cheap that you
just don't necessarily need that but I
wanted to try it for the channel you
know it's all for the good of the
channel very good you guys are right
though you guys are right Betty Ann
hello to you hello beauty native style
great blog and it's your basket even
wishes are nice sahaja says birchbox has
the new gimme brow coming this month's
box so she's going to wait to compare to
the essence 1 mm nice nice nice nice ok
so here we go i appreciate you to
mallanna ok Kevin a quan I i saw this i
wasn't going to get it the little
plastic thing just fell but i SWA
 and I was like you know when you
swatch something and you just fall in
love with it right away i'm going to
swatch three swatches hopefully you guys
can see because i'm feeling really bad
about the quality ok ok so you can do
this separately as highlighter brought
blush and bronzer or we swirl them
together a bit ok that's the three
together so I don't know how I'm going
to use it yet it's very interesting all
three of them together hopefully you
guys can see let me switch over the
camera view because I want to make sure
that this looks ok yep ok so this is all
three of them together this is the
bronzer blush and highlight and then
this is three together it looks actually
kind of similar that bronze are fully
overpowering it I don't know what's
going to happen on the cheeks once it
gets on there with a brush I mean who
knows what's going to happen you know so
I'm excited to try that and for some
reason it doesn't blow my mind it'll
probably end up going back but i really
want to keep it really we keep it by
thomas pensive is it necessary no it's
not necessary but i really wanted it and
it's just I had a makeup addict moment
you know it's $58 if you eat the homers
for this that's in so he gets it's crazy
it's crazy I have issues I have problems
and I admit it I realized that I realize
it so Jenny said she seemed rave review
she wants that it looks like Neapolitan
ice cream that's right delay Nia doesn't
like me opponents and I drink and they
did have a warm one the warm one was um
what happened ouch what happens why are
we outing Michelle said ouch Malia said
ouch that I dropped something oh-58 box
yet
horn or no but we'll see what happens
we'll see happens they did have a cool
tone one that one was all sold out in
appleton they had a warm turns one that
was all sold out so you're our brush
tree exactly exactly okay she said she
was still way too much on her hourglass
real all right so the last thing was one
that I mean if you would told me I was
going to go in and buy this I would've
been like no way I'm by that there's no
way to buy that it's not going to happen
because I have an issue with Smashbox my
issue with Smashbox is that I bought a
full exposure palette and I hated it I
absolutely hated it I know some people
love the full exposure palette but I
hate mine I needed it I Shander giving
it to my mother it's got a row of Matt's
a row of sparkles I I the Mets were good
but the sparkly ones there was so much
fallout I just could not even handle it
cannot even handle it loosen it says the
by Terry one is 82 see your fine girl
all is then he always make me feel
better thank you Leslie's leaving bye
Leslie um so let me show you what I got
this is something I didn't know existed
i don't know if you guys have seen this
and maybe it was in the show and i just
read it so fast but i didn't realize
that it was in the show but this is the
smashbox lighting theory masterclass
palette contour stroke shadow is a 65 it
was $65 it says it's a three hundred
ninety nine dollar value so i swatched
it and it seemed fabulous so I've got it
and this is my first crack at it um yeah
I don't think I've ever put this in the
show I don't think I've ever seen this
before i'm pretty sure that this is
brand-new tabatha can tell me if this
has ever been in a show i don't think it
has have the nose of script by the time
stamp when I was doing the scripts I
knew everything it was in the show but
now that I don't do district anymore
she's better at it than I am okay so it
comes in this crazy packaging so if you
do order this know that it's packaged
super well they do not want any
shattering so in this cardboard here and
then it's in the plastic here and then
no not the show nice Tabitha okay but I
feel better now okay Oh who's leaving by
Deepa hi debug by deep i miss you
already smashbox I've been into but
liquid are those new liquid was a
pleasant surprise to me it was wonderful
formula and nice Smashbox is hit or miss
for me to only tested the primers sherry
says I was at the event planning on
buying a travel sample bag so good
timing any excuse for cute makeup at all
I know right Krishna says it's brand new
when no one is talked about on Instagram
or anything well there we go so this is
what it looks like it's gorgeous
packaging about this hologram
holographic print on the front not prank
by a hologram that you can see that it
moves with the light and it's got this
elastic band that keeps it closed now
this is really cool ok especially if
you're a makeup artist and you're
looking for something for your kid so it
comes with this one of you take the
plastic off I'm dropping it I'm dropping
it everything is super super protected
oh no my battery's dying I suppose it's
plugged in why is my god are you dying
hold on a second sorry guys I have to
play the minerals we're gonna die no
dying hold on a second two seconds ok
hopefully that helped I plugged in it
though Oh plug in a different club that
plug is temperamental that should work
what is going on here oh it's not
pushing in here duh ok now we're plugged
in all right so go back to this match
month so this is what it looks like on
the inside and have these little other
things and it's not this plastic thing
that goes over top of it and what you do
is you snap it into the case so there's
this side this is all cream products and
then this side is all powder products so
they keep them separate and beginning
this little plastic to go over
Thompson's your creams and powders don't
mix right so let me oh no that already
come on little thing hmm I'm on a second
okay there we go all right snapped it
back on I hope it on there I tell you
okay so let me snap it into the case
here so that comes detached and it looks
like this on the inside like that and
it's got these little pockets I don't
really know why there's little pockets
but it talks if it's ugly tip cards on
how to do things and then there's these
little pockets hold I don't know what
but I'm going to snap these inside okay
so there we go and then this one is
going to go in like this and you can put
them in either way so you can use to the
contour on one side it doesn't matter
which side you put on because they have
a little clips on either side so one
thing that would be they might well you
know I don't think that make a fit of
brushing here it's very flat that was an
interesting idea I don't think it's for
brushes just because it's hard I guess
it so the car doesn't fall out oh it's
like a whole little book thing in here
so this is the first time I've opened
this I saw it in the store and I got it
so there's all these little things here
so it talks about how to apply and then
this one says Smashbox correction oh
this is a French they're trying to read
French side so here we go so this right
here is this and then contouring made
easy and then strobing simplified
they've got those little tip cards in
the one side and then the other side has
these little tip cards it says the Magic
Hour mimics the soft glow of la sunset
and it says daylight soft and subtle for
bright daylight so got a night look and
add a look here and that goes in there
so that is what it looks like when it's
all put together and I saw sahaja
something like does this seem like it's
a lot of work but not really that would
you put it together Krishna says master
class she was available I missed it hold
on massaquoi she was available for well
over two years on 24 calm so it might
might still be up there oh I don't know
maybe he says I hate cleaning everything
except my makeup collection I'll clean
off and sanitize everything every every
few months yup definitely yeah we'll
definitely do a review on this palette I
definitely going to
that I'm going to do a couple of
swatches for you let me get my towel so
I can color switch a little bit but I'm
super excited about this because when i
swatched it in the store it seemed
really nice the brow product is not
coming off my hand but everything else
is caveat if you plan to do a review of
this Rhonda says I got an email that you
can get the VIP emerge items from the
event today online just for today as
we're exclusive now they tell you now
they tell you Felicia wants to know what
strobing is it's just basically over
highlighting like a lot of highlighting
ok so cream products I like that this
can go up and this actually can be
removed so we've got these color
correcting things here which I've never
done color correcting so I'm going to
have fun playing with that and let's do
a contour bronze highlight contour
bronze highlight they feel very oily
very oily there you go ok so there's
contour bronze and highlight and then
it's a mint highlights that is a matte
highlight and then there are three
luminous highlights room is pink
luminous gold and limit is peach don't
really swatch so well in the hands yeah
they're very they're very oily and
they're very weak in pigmentation we put
them on the inside of my wrist just to
make sure I've given them a fair shot
here yeah I don't know if you can even
see them I can barely see them so very
very subtle on those I when I was in a
store they seemed much greater I don't
know that's very strange but they
definitely feel very oily based I'm not
going to squash the contour the color
correcting stuff unless you guys really
want me to megan says I don't care for
the pallets maybe because of how bulky
they are they have a lot of shades but
it takes up so much room yeah it's got a
lot in it there's definitely a lot going
on in here I can see this being great
or travel that this would be the only
thing we need to bring for travel the
other thing that called me to this is
the selection of shadows that are in
here are really great I mean just just
the way that they support crazy lighting
I think you're right Karen the selection
shouted they put in here really look
beautiful they really do so let me wipe
off this contour and see if I can get
some of these swatch actually I'm just
watch them on the inside I still have
Jeffrey stars pink swatch there that i
cannot get off i swatched last night i'm
going to show you that to the beauty
killer palette i have that i'm going to
show that to you in a minute because we
still need to get into the products that
you guys made me buy so let me go ahead
and just watch some of these matte
shades it looks like there are 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 matte shades in here and 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 shimmery shades 9 I don't know 1 2 3
4 per foot per wanna know what's going
on with that five six seven eight yeah
so it's about half in half for the mat
and a shimmery so we've got sand totally
nude nectar and almond sand totally nude
nectar almonds and I know brush watches
are better I know brush watches are
better we're going to do this pretty
quick there you go narender said I think
Smashbox face products are good i have
contour palette best palate i like the
simple packaging and am decent eyebrow
pencil I just finished concealer and
that was good yeah I have the contour
palette and I really like their contour
palette to all right we'll do truffle
lightwave sunrise and sunlight these
feel really buttery boom oh alright
there we go okay so that is optics
Metallica note no truffle lightwave
sunrise and son lit sunlight I'm excited
about the sunlight shade these two
actually these three are really making
me go wit alright next ones are called
optics
violet metallic bronze and metallic
brick optics metallic violet metallic
bronze metallic brick run that arm space
here whoo that purple who I am there you
go yeah Jenny I'm having trouble with my
I don't have my regular set up today I
was having trouble with a connected to
my computer so that's why it doesn't
sound very good so I apologize all right
and then there's four more shades here
they go wipe off these top ones okay and
then we have nocturnal blackout sumantra
and backlit nocturnal is a blue it's a
very royal blue it's very pretty and go
all right there you go Oh Betty amaz
it's your birthday happy birthday my
birthday is on Wednesday alright so
those are super duper uber pigmented and
amazing looking hopefully they blend
well because that's a thing too is you
can't just have an eyeshadow that
swatches well it has to go in the eyes
well it has to blend well all of that
the purple is insane and then I really
like this purple down here purple was
stood in that blue it's got like a light
blue shift in there with it with a deep
Navy but then it with a light blue ship
that's really pretty and I like this one
too this one was of one spectrum that
was really complex and beautiful so all
right last thing in here is the blushes
these are powder blushes so we don't
have any cream blushes in here we just
have the green highlights and the cream
contour products and now we have the
powder blushes swatches are coming at
nice aren't they Daniel RM having
trouble right wiping swatches off my
fingers so if that's any indication so
the first one is called candlelight
carnation and then spectrum I'm just
going to swatch these here so that's
candlelight carnation and spectrum and
they look absolutely beautiful so there
goes oies birthday too happy birthday
Zoe
alright so that is this that is
everything that's in here so again it
was $65 and I love the packaging I know
that it's quite big but if you this is
all of your taking this is really all
you would need for like like this could
be all I would take on my road trip like
this might just be it so we'll see so we
will be playing with this on periscope
that you're not following me on
periscope I get ready in the mornings
for work I'm gonna play with this and
the jeffree star pilot over the next
week so definitely i'm probably on
periscopes that you can see you playing
with this and then of course i'll be
doing a review hopefully before the end
of june i'll be were doing both of you
the beauty killer palette and the
smashbox palette so now it is time the
packing is pretty isn't it Katherine the
hollow is just oh I know right stuff ok
so now it's time to go into the
community maybe buy it ok because
there's lots of things you know there
was a YouTube maybe buy it like YouTube
makes me buy things but not as much as
people in the community do people on
periscope go on facebook you want to
comment to the videos I learned so much
like I seriously think I have an unfair
advantage over a lot of youtubers
because I have you and you teach me so
much about everything about what works
for you but doesn't work because like
everyone has different skin tones are
one of different skin types they learn
so much that I just can't learn on my
own so I think I've an unfair advantage
in that way so when I buy products a lot
of times it's because someone in the
community is recommended and said that
it's awesome so first thing that I
bought uh this one really wasn't
recommended by the community I really
just wanted to show you this beauty
color palette by jeffree star and I did
do a Facebook live swatching of this so
if you go to my facebook it's Jenna w
you IM is my last name i might switch
back over to like one of those like
public figure pages i don't know i
decided yet but i made my profile public
so that you could see my swatching and
first impression of these i did use them
on my eyes today first impression is
they work really really well i use all
star power princess what else did I use
I use
fashion I use China white and I used
Courtney today oh and I used vanity so I
used a lot of these shades today and so
far so good on this I definitely need to
do more one thing that I really want to
do on my channel and you guys can
definitely tell me what you think about
this is i want to get palettes let the
beauty killer palette like the cations
and you get a local palette like the
what you call it the Urban Decay
electric palette and I want to try to do
some looks for you that are more
wearable so like when the typical person
sees this they may be like there's no
way I'm wearing those colors but I'm
wearing a lot of these colors Oh miles
today and it's not crazy there's ways to
work with a lot of this stuff so I was
thinking about adding that in to my
channel content is how to work with
really great pellets like this and make
them wearable for every day for most
people so the pallets that pans are
absolutely gigantic yeah the ladies like
the pens a pant kind of depends are
really really really are i'm gerry see
how much is in them sometimes it can be
deceptive sometimes they can be real
thin so I don't know but so far so good
on this I really excited that this
palette I want to play with it more the
only one that I was having trouble
swatching on the brush was this one this
rich keyword that I can't say for
another couple weeks so I'm not teaching
anymore but this one I had some
significant trouble with but other than
that i'm really loving this palette so
far but yeah go to Facebook and then
font search for Jen w you i am a sense
for what's up in makeup that's my last
name and then you should be able to find
the video of my first impressions of
that and i think it was like 8 15
minutes something like that and i can
put that down in the description after
the video is over to after we want to
strim ember all those things I said I
was going to put in the description and
I said I was going to put the
description and you're watching this on
the replay and it's not there take me a
comment say hey Jenny said you're going
to do this we didn't do it at halls
killer aren't major things that
community made me buy big thing that
I've been loving the community made me
buy was the Too Faced chocolate bonbons
pilot this thing is superb uh I talked
about this thing a bunch i have the
video on the smelly collet smackdown so
you probably heard an great about this
and i can spend more time on it cuz we
only have 25 minutes and i hope
I want to show you but but this is
definitely something the community maybe
buy another thing that community maybe
by was stuff from makeup revolution I
heard so much good stuff from the
community for the makeup revolution
products and I kind of went a little
nautical a bottle of stuff so there's
been some hits and misses for me the
biggest hit for me has been the makeup
revolution matte blush really really
really like this a lot the pigmentation
is great lasting power is great it's not
powdery but it's not overly pigmented
but some brushes can be overly pigmented
and then you can work with them those
are so stinkin pigmented so so yeah
definitely recommend these this one is
in the shade divine this is the only one
that I own so I don't know if there's
variation between the shades as far as
formula but this one I really really
like a lot it's very very nice then what
next oh the highlight now the highlight
I can see why people would really like
this I personally it doesn't fit my
personal tastes it's not poppy enough
for me this is a really nice everyday
highlight for someone that doesn't want
to look all super glow you just want a
little like highlight have it be really
pretty on your cheeks this is good this
is good but for me it's not quite enough
for me it kind of let me down a little
bit to be completely honest Krista says
I got the girls on film palette because
of me all did you like it Krista I hope
you love it I did not bring that one out
because I have that whole collaboration
video with Christy game that I did so I
did not bring that one out for this
video but I do love the girls on film
absolutely love it i would say i love
that just as much as i love this blush
really really good rebecca says makeup
revolution has my favorite highlight I
mary-lou manizer sister oh yeah you know
I love my Mary Lou you know I love it
sandra says I gotta both radiance
palettes nice I didn't get the boys on
someone I just got the girls on someone
good day good work day highlight yes
Diana exactly exactly and a beauty like
being in life Ohio sis blush is amazing
jenny says mug blushes reformulated love
yes I'm starting to love those as well I
just got the one in my
if she bag was if see boxy charm boxy
charm I really like it Julie says Jen
use it over a setting spray it's really
bright oh hey settings friends I'd like
the only person on the planet I think
that heat settings grades I'd have fully
admit I am a weirdo the I&amp;amp;I ball
everyone loves settings phrase I hate
them I absolutely hate them I do not
like spraying things on my face
especially anything that feels in any
way tacky I absolutely hate it so I will
i do not do studies phrase but i'll
figure out some way to work with it I'm
sure that I could find something some
way to work with this I don't hate it I
just it's not popping up but it's good
to know if I use a sudden sway maybe if
I put a little setting spray on my brush
and then put it in here and then put it
on maybe that would be good i advise
grandson is free on my face I don't like
it alright moving on oh the other thing
that I didn't bring out that I really
love is there contour kit that contour
kit is super bad if you're looking for a
really nice drugstore contour kit the
makeup revolution one is awesome I
really love it the last leap out really
really good Diana says I live and die by
my settings for a month for 12 hour
shifts I can't do it man i can't do it i
hate the way it feels but i understand
that i'm weird I'm weird they had a hole
at the support of the ID Rouge thing
they had they must have had like 15
different they wouldn't that many it was
like eight exaggerating but they had a
whole lineup of setting sprays here like
cuddly and like like the waters like the
supposed primer waters the spray waters
of the fancy like skincare ones and all
lined up and I was like oh no I don't
mean any of that I would need to do that
you don't like to me there Katherine ok
Ranma alumna and the only connected did
not like four make a revolution that I
got was got a conical one palette I
heard this was a joke for either the
lorac Pro original or the original Naked
palette and formula wise I do not like
most of these shadows some of them
aren't too bad but for the most part
they're really just not good as far as
the lasting power they apply pretty well
but they're like gone by five hours in
like on my eyeshadow seriously so I this
is was a big no for me big big move for
me Sandra says I don't like sprayed my
face makes my face go wet yeah exactly
and then the thing is is when it gets
too much in one spot and doesn't like
scrap evenly boo so overall makeup
revolution it's been a win for me a
comic one is the only one that I did not
was but again I've heard some people
really really liking the iconic one so I
maybe i'm weird own them all right
moving on to other things this was a big
one because this was expensive but I
don't know I wish I knew who it was that
made me buy it but she said to me in a
comment she said Jen the reason why you
don't like high-end mascaras why you
think drugstore mascaras are so fabulous
while you put drugstore mascaras above
all high-end mascaras is because you
have never tried the Lancome grandiose
you have never tried it and you need to
try it because that is the best mascara
of all time so I bought it tennis right
here this is the Lancome radios and I
bought it specifically because of that
comment thirty dollars I spell on us now
will tell you I do really like this
crazy wand who there's like a hair net
or something what that is a little buzz
or something I like this crazy wand
because it with the crazy one you can go
like this but then when you get here
gets a little hard so that's when you go
like this and then you can flip it over
or you can put it this way meat and meat
I do like the crazy one it's really fun
and it works great quality of it very
good mascara excellent mascara is far as
lengthening volumizing fantastic really
really liked a lot does it mean my
drugstore heck no it doesn't beat my
drugstore I have to say for the record
it does not be my Maybelline it does not
be my Maybelline $30 does not be my
Maybelline that's just me that's just me
but this is the thing everybody's
lashing you different I have very short
sparse flashes you already have a lot of
lashes maybe
just want to rock your socks off then
rock my socks off it's great don't get
me wrong too fantastic my Sarah I'm
going to stick with my Maybelline third
the press sticking with my mate one so
yes this is the guest Hypnose drama now
this is the radius this is a gray dias
there you go when I say Hypnose
hopefully I said radios there is a
hypnosis but this is the radius do all
Lancome mascara smell like perfume I got
a sample and it smelled an old late or
can't let smell it Mary sounds pretty
bad it's not bad though actually smells
kind of nice for a mascara there you go
way up here away from I know I have to
put it like way up here to smell it but
it definitely has a curfew any kind of
smell but I never smelled it until you
just told me smell it so there you go oh
my gooood Chrissy says ciate mouse care
is a bomb really that's awesome and the
Lydia says the blink mascara you know
what the blank mascara for me I use a
blink mascara I was swearing by the
blink mistero stays with us my stare
ever and then I start drying out on me
and it was like no more no more it
didn't last long enough for me maybe I
didn't sort properly maybe I didn't have
a cap twisted all the way or something
but died on me and then Mellie time I
essence last princess and lash
sensational your favorite they're my
favorites too absolutely I felt I got
something on my face something weird on
my face I Marion wants to know if I
tried fortune favors the brave palette
no I have not yet when how it's on sale
today going house on sale today if
there's something on my face no
apparently not all right I'm switch back
over tea because I can't see myself i
have my my thing down i can't see
anything that was something that was
good i'm glad i tried it I'm not hating
on her for recommending it good mascara
but I'm still gonna stick to my
drugstore all right this is a good one

sighing for my job is made it that much
more complex because I need to make sure

fab but I've heard so much about this
from the community and that's why I got
it are you done with love yet are you

in your eye it will be gross okay all
right you wanted to sit there okay he
wants to cuddle okay all right so let me
show you this now it does i'm being
almost i'm not going to watch this

over them but this right here is a
fantastic highlight i'm sure you can
find swatches online
bye buddy there you go all right but I
don't want to put my fingers my products

yeah this one is a really really really
nice highlight it's beautiful and I got
it thanks to the community and it lasts

on the cheeks so get his highlight on
there you go cameras internet famous
near the cute doggy man uses we are
trouble over your face I could just take

highlighted red I'll just bathed in my
my gilded honey another highlight
speaking of highlight that between
anybody with champagne Bob everybody's
freaking out over champagne pops of
course I had to get it was actually out
with a member of the community with
Sandra and we actually met through
YouTube community and she was not that
far for me so we went to the mall we
went shopping had a great time and we're
still friends which is really cool that
you know I've met someone who the
committee and we actually hang out in
their life but yeah this is very very
nice I only complain about champagne pop
is it doesn't last on my cheeks like
golden honey will last all day champagne
Rob needs like a midday obligation read
application like so I've heard people
with the setting sprays and stuff can
make it last longer but I'm not willing
to go there I'm not wouldn't they go
there or no of God not we wouldn't go
there all right he got ten minutes left
and I got two more things I want to show
you let me see what else is going on in
the community anything else let's say
Jenny says I'm thinking she's not plug
for Bailey feed I would love gin up are
you talking about the talking thing I
think Jenni's talking about the toddy
thing that Todd team was going to fly
somebody else California to clad with
her I would be so happy and bailing on
it barely got it I would be so happy for
her if then he says makeup revolution hi
later you have to rub off the top coat
to get to the good stuff brushing excuse
makes a difference to ksenia we need to
talk we've chatted about this so sahaja
says I'm so curious that no one has said
anything about the lorac highlighters
and anyone try them I haven't tried them
I maybe I should Chelsea's as hygienic
finally made a morning chat yay
Chelsea's here and says there's no como
d oh no man o people people promoting
something another
them Oh Bailey and jen clap that'd be
cool I would do that I yelled out that
Larry seller says my first time yay so
glad you're here Diana says i love the
lorac highlighter in the gate forum i
love it and the entire palette Oh Bailey
nice channel oh ok Jenny prevail ed was
was nominated for that to a logical
mention her for the tonti clapping I
only talks going to do it that was like
back in November I don't think it's
going to happen at this point Delaney
says so happy for me all thank you let
me youtube as a job super far from there
but so inspirational to see useful son
and I am doing it full time I'm gonna be
doing it full time to fall and will
actually guess it'll be late summer
after get back to my road trip so
starting end of july i'll be doing it
full time so I'm very excited about it
because I want to do more more videos i
will put more contents put a lot more
contents alright so next thing is that
when i mentioned is not a youtube main
you buy it what if the YouTube makes me
use it all not YouTube the community
makes me use it all the time I have to
give it a shout out this is such a spice
by Maybelline I'm telling you that this
shade right here is probably the most
popular shade recommended on periscope
that I wear and people of all skin tones
seem to love touch of spice by hitting
if you don't love touch of spice by
Maybelline if you don't own it you may
want to get it okay it looks very deep
and scary but for someone that's a
lighter skin tone maybe it will be an
evening out kind of lipstick someone
that's a deeper skin tone or medium to
deeper skin tone it's a really nice
every day for me i have used this every
day what I do with this a lot I'm going
to wait for daytime is I'll use this and
then i'll top it with something later
just to kind of tone it down a little
bit but touch of spice oh this is like
hash tag teams hunter spice is like a
thing okay it's all Valerie Stahl did
you ever see Valerie around on Paris
over on here I blame Valerie for it you
know there's so many people there's so
many individual unique people that I get
to interact with and I'm so thankful and
I didn't value all the credit for this
but there's a lot of people that love to
despise it's not just Valerie but such a
spice man oh and unicorn tears yes
unicorn tears we talk about unicorn
cares a lot by to face color changing
like it's like Oh iridescent I use that
more because of them but I didn't buy it
because of that I fought it before but
such a spice man touch of spice to
wither definite winner and like I said
if you if you're scared of the deepness
of this because you're Bellator skin
tone just throw it over go really nude
lipstick over top of it and you can
totally tone it down totally tone it
down all right two more things that the
community name you by neon estas via
contour kit I was not going to buy this
you know why me thrill with you here for
a second you know how on products are
really hyped up on youtube or brands are
really hyper pudding tube and all the
people that are getting it for promo or
all look who's the best thing ever and I
hope you know you have to buy it so
amazing and then you're like are you
being real with thing right now are you
being real with me that this is the best
thing ever because I do not want to
spend my money on something if it is not
the best thing ever and you're just
telling me that because you really like
the people over there or because it gave
you something for free and you just have
a positive experience with the brand but
it's really not all that you know what I
mean like I just got a little nervous
the soy wasn't going to try it but then
like then when people in the community
started recommending it was like all
right well maybe this is real maybe this
is real and it is real it is real it's a
great contour palette it's really good
and i love that the pans pop out so I
don't know I appreciate it to be so
decent individuals i think they do so
that you can pop them in and out if you
like to the highlights are fantastic i
use this one as an under-eye setting
powder all the time all the time and
this one is the 1i typically used for my
contour in the middle I have it as a
highlighter it's a little weak for me
like you know I like my pop and
highlights the little week for me but I
do use it on occasion I also let the
pinky tone highlighter too so I haven't
used these two as much because they are
a little deep for my skin tone so I may
actually pass those along to somebody
that is a bit deeper skin tone so that
they can appreciate them if they have a
busy power they want to call them thanks
I don't think I'm ever going to use
these except for maybe as an eyeshadow
something like that but I don't really
meet them
oh no are we out of sound is the sound
not working no that's not good I hope
it's still working better than the elf
contour palette Alana wants to know
lastly powers better applications not
better but lasting powers better because
i feel like with the elf even though it
applies really really well I don't feel
like the lasting power is a hundred
percent there and I think too with the
elf it depends on what foundation I'm
wearing look look with some foundations
and I haven't quite picked out which
ones it seems the last better than other
ones i do still love the elf them the
elk one's pretty magical but this one's
pretty magical too and you get more
shades in this too I don't know I don't
know oh god I'm glad you guys can hear
me good I do have the kat von d I
blasted power issues with a cap on me to
honestly I would get this one over the
kat von z because I feel like this one
has better lasting power at least for me
how long does the elf last on me Krista
wants to know about five hours five to
six hours at the most where this will
last me all day when you'll still be
able to see it at the end of the day you
know so that's just me I felt really bad
about that but but it's six dollars like
right exactly a lot is like it doesn't
last but it's six dollars I know right
and this is 40 more than six dollars so
if you don't I mean if you don't care
that it doesn't lead might not last and
completely Tour de definitely get the
elf don't get this get the elf you know
but if that's something it's really
important to you when you don't do sunny
spring maybe you might want to get this
one instead I love the elderly is good I
agree I agree I'm glad you guys can hear
great Megan there I'm afraid to buy type
of spice it looks pretty dark for my
skin John me again I don't you know I
don't know I don't know how it would
look on you because I'm not used to
seeing anywhere like those kinds of
shades like I don't know I think I've
ever seen you wear shave like this i
wish you to come over made if you could
come over you could try mine because I
wouldn't that wouldn't get free to share
my lipstick with you because you're
Megan all right couple more things let's
say oh we've only got three minutes left
the last thing
I wanted to show you this actually is
the last thing I want to show you is a
carli bybel palette this is something
that I heard about from the community
why I heard about it but I was like
going to pass on it but then everybody
said how amazing it was there's lawn
mowing going on outside my house I'm
hoping you can't hear that and my dog
Skippy clapping I'm hoping a sound
thought too terrible but people told me
how amazing this is and I'm worrying
really really really like it a lot
really like it a lot the only issue I
have with it as I heard the color
variation is just not there I wish she
had put in a little bit more varied
tones like I totally get the new thing
she's got going on here but it's a
little too boring in the shade selection
it's very boring but the quality shadows
are fabulous absolutely fabulous and
these highlighters I don't really see a
difference in the formula between the
eyeshadows and the highlighters they
seem like pretty much the same thing
just in different pans so I don't know I
know this sounds muffled is the only
don't have my typical sounds I couldn't
get my webcam to work it wasn't
connecting appear right but I
should have a new computer by the next
chat so it should be better but yeah I
mean it's just not hmm it's not very
exciting but the quality is fantastic in
the community did not scare me going on
a quality on this so those were the
products that i want to show you today i
hope that you're excited about the new
fall products i know i'm excited about
it i D like I'm mostly excited about the
face cream randomly and the Smashbox
palette we'll see how all of that goes
if you have any questions I'm seeing a
lot of great questions happening over
here in the the chat and unfortunate i
can't get to all them so what i would
recommend you do is either after this
video writers which would be about 15
minutes or so once this video is ready
to have comments on it sometimes it's a
little shorter you can leave a comment
questions in the comments below and
people will answer them i will try to
answer them or you can head over to the
facebook page we have a facebook page
called what's up and makeup so if you
group / what's the makeup it is a
private group that's the 18 or older to
join it and we do have moderators that
will let you in i'll kind of stock here
a little bit on your profile make sure
you look like you're a real person and
not just somebody who's going to spam
the group and then we'll let you in and
you can ask questions over there I see
like there's there's a
about eleven hundred members over there
right now and it's just such a wonderful
community the moderators are really good
at keeping it a positive like happy
environment everybody's just so nice and
helpful so if you have questions that I
didn't answer or if I you know you have
suggestions for future videos or if you
have anything you want to leave me you
can leave them in the comments after the
video is over don't put them in the chat
right now because the chat stuff is
going to disappear but leave them there
or go to the Facebook group and someone
else will answer them if you put on the
facebook group I probably won't see that
because I can't there's so many post in
the facebook group i get i get lost oh
my phone I don't see a lot of the post
on the facebook group so we also have
the what's up in makeup app which I want
to be more a part of I haven't been
poaching over there as much as i would
like but that's another great place to
post your looks post your questions
things like that you download that for
Apple products or Android products and
then it's like Instagram but you don't
have to worry about being judged and all
of that just really nice people over
there so that's another place there's
also a forum on what to the makeup calm
that you can join and we have stuff all
over the place but just a lot of really
really nice people so you're more than
welcome to join in any way that you feel
comfortable and then of course chat is
another way to be part of the collective
brain so I want to thank you so much for
joining me today for child i preciate
you being here and caring about what i
bought it may it's awesome that you're
here and that we had such a great
conversation so it's been wonderful
having here the plan is to have chat at
10am next week you never know what's
going to happen I could never because
I'm a real person and then not a
television show I can't guarantee chat
is always going to be at the exact same
time every single week I try to be
consistent with it it's rare that I
change things up but I got the Smashbox
palette yeah no one really wanted it I
go like on chat later trying to go to
vote with the Sephora you know some
things happen but we I try to be pretty
consistent about it but because I'm a
human being things happen but the plan
is to have chat attending on next week

june i will actually be on my road trip
so i don't know what's happening this
week this month for the
last of the other month we'll have to
play by ear see so thank you again so
