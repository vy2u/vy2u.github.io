changed things again Oh
YouTube has changed things and you can
see all the junk on my floor let's even
pull it up a little bit so I can let see
now my head space is too small let me
see if I move back cuz I got I don't
want you to see okay well this is just
like a cover to like make things
brighter like for lights and stuff we'll
make that a little lower so you can't
see it as much hey everybody
wow this is very very different okay
before we even get going I have no idea
how the mic is this week I got more
really upset people last week really not
last week we before really upset about
the mic volume like really upset
I'm really sorry like please don't be
mad at me like I'm trying I'm trying
really hard to get the mic volume
I ordered a mic and when you switch from
one generate go to like oh oh that's so
awesome okay Sarah says the mic is
awesome this week okay YouTube has
changed things so that now we can go
directly through YouTube to livestream
it's so much easier to read right now I
don't even use that encoding software
which i think is what was making the mic
blast out so I'm hoping I went on Amazon
I bought a brand new microphone that was
about four times as much as this one and
then it wasn't compatible so I have to
send it back and it's been a mess
so okay truly lovely says she's on
headphones and it's good for her oh my
gosh thank you so much yeah okay because
it's been like this big thing because
people were so upset last week it was
like this big anxiety thing for me all
week like how the sounds gonna be and
then I had a request from I know this is
totally off topic from the video if
you're watching the replay I'm sorry
I'll get to the point in a minute I got
a request from someone who relies on
closed captions to try to get closed
captions on the live stream so she can
participate I tried to do that this
morning I failed miserably but just know
if you rely on closed captions I'm
trying I'm trying so yeah okay thank you
guys
so let's talk about what we're gonna be
talking about today so today we are
going to be discussing like our general
wants out of makeup companies I feel
like you know no matter what we do in
life whether we're you know a banker or
a lawyer or you work in a restaurant or
you work in the mall or wherever you
work you're never going to make
everybody happy no matter what and I
think it's the same thing with makeup
brands you know makeup brands try really
hard obviously to make consumers happy
will some of them try harder than others
but I feel like some makeup brands try
really hard to try to give the consumers
what they want and the consumers never
seem to be happy so I thought maybe we
could focus this video on you know
things that we are just totally done
with like every time we post something
that's like mermaid themed or fairy
themed or something like that people are
like no more mermaids I'm done with
mermaids but then there's also comments
they're like I love mermaids is so cool
you know like so I'm trying to figure
out like what Steph says it's not synced
I don't even know Chris says it sounds
perfect
I don't know Kayla says done with fake
hollow I am totally with you on the fake
hollow thing just call it your destiny
or a decimal - I guess some people don't
know what iridescent is but maybe they
know what hollow is so maybe they're
trying like the marketing thing but yeah
okay Therese says it sounds looks and
sounds good okay well we'll just keep
going and just hope for the best so I
thought would kind of just just have a
discussion about what we want as a
community because we don't represent the
all of beauty lovers we can only
represent ourselves of what we are
looking for what do we want from brands
so I was thinking we could talk about
complexion products first just kind of
work our way up I think with primers
that's very individual as far as what
we're looking for and I feel like
primers kind of have run the gamut of
everything you know for face primers
we've got you know ones that were more
luminescent some that are more matte
some that are more hydrating some that
are more silicone II you know I think
we've kind of got it on primers as far
as like formulas go and then I primers
you know we've got um I think that some
people probably would appreciate more
hydrating eye primers for people with
dry lids also like the creasing thing I
feel like some primers have kind of got
but and then like ones that need out
discoloration those are my favorites the
ones that like completely this get rid
of discoloration I love those but I feel
like with complexion products there's a
lot to be desired with complexion
products so I mean I feel like one of
the obvious things is of course a wider
shade range if you had a chance to watch
what's of a makeup so far
I love the piece about target and how
they're trying to target POC and people
of color and trying to beef up their
offerings for people that are not you
know lighter skin and I think that
that's fantastic because we all have a
right to be able to go in and buy
something you know and there's one
person she said she was unsubscribing
she's gonna be really mad at me she gets
mad at me every time I talk about that I
care about people of color finding
complexion products I don't know why she
gets really mad at me so I'm sorry you
mad at me I'm not gonna stop talking
about it but anyway yeah so I feel like
that's kind of a given to expand shade
ranges I think that's important but I
want to see what people are saying as
far as beyond examining shade ranges as
far as complexion products what do we
want Kathryn says I want products with
clean ingredients that's something
that's like it's like I like that's such
a like I agree with you but I don't know
what what does that mean to you I would
love to know Kathryn what that means do
you clean ingredients yes like
ingredients that aren't harmful to the
skin I would imagine like denatured
alcohol that seems to be in every
setting spray that exists for people
that love setting sprays Asma says I'm
done with benefit using all the same
products and new bundles and making it
seem like something new look frustrating
yeah I mean I think the bundles from
benefit are great for people that want
to try benefit but if you're past
wanting to try benefit it'll be nice for
them to come out with some new products
even along with the kits alongside the
kids I think that would be great
oh it skipped down oh I didn't say hello
to the collective brain oh I forgot to
say hello to the collective brain so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and
scroll up real quick I'm gonna say what
Steph says hi Steph I want brands to cut
the crap just trim out all the crap I
don't got time for the BS and some
brands pull-off be
sure and clean there you go Katrina
cruelty-free yes alright let me come up
real quick and just say hello to the
first people oh yes I believe Liz was
first hello - Liz hello Sandra hello
Sandra is in one of my videos a really
long time ago she helped make like a
crafty lunch baggy thing
so hi Sandra good to see you I haven't
seen Sandra since then I don't think no
maybe we got together once since then
amber is here Teresa M Oh in the house
Joe Ian and simply Bonnie is here and B
Mac hello welcome back and Consuelo and
Julie and Jennifer and a street I'm
gonna call Youm or a saint I think I
think a street sounds cool so I'm just
gonna I'm just gonna call you that
hopefully that's right though
McQueen Anna is here in Ashley and W
Melissa and Joe and JM ageless beauty
and Karin singing ASMR hello Karen
singing yes mr it's good to see you oh
and Sarah hi Sarah how evil is it huh
Blair Keibler at the beauty hub good to
see you alright let me scroll down and
let's go back up to where we were
talking about complexion products and we
go back up to Steph's comments because
she's she's easy to see because she's
blue because she is one of our French
wenches making sure we don't have any
creepers in here alright so let's see
Susan says good morning let's see
Deirdre says I want products don't wipe
off as soon as you touch them
amen to that Vanessa I'm so done with
the super matte foundations they make
you look so kicky yes and then like for
example like I just got if you saw I got
the covergirl the big box that a lot of
people got I got one of those and the
powders in there are like like matte
flats like and there's four of them and
the lightest one is too dark for me for
me it's too dark for me and I'm not even
that light you know and the darkest one
is like oh man it was really bad but my
point was was far as the matte flat
thing it totally like flattens out
everything like any kind of dimension
you had like they're like totally
two-dimensional not totally not
literally but it's just really flat so
I'm with you I like like a like a nice
soft
like a satiny kind of finish to my
foundations that's the personal
preference though because of course all
of this is gonna be personal preference
but I really like a nice satiny look
like something that looks more like skin
rather than really matte or really
luminous you know I'm noticing a lot of
the Instagram looks are looking more I
don't know like more plastic have you
noticed that on Instagram what
foundations I know there's a little
off-topic but that that people are
starting to look more plastic to me
excuse me
like like I love the Laura Lee photos
that she took for her a new line like
the pictures are gorgeous gorgeous
gorgeous gorgeous beautiful photos I
feel like the people almost look fake
like they almost look plastic has even
retouched so much like I would love the
return complexion wise like this is more
a photography thing a more natural
looking skin you know I would love for
that to be more of a trend rather than
that plastic fake look even though
they're beautiful they are beautiful but
you know I don't know I just I like them
that's just again personal preference
let's see I'm trying to look for
something new you know frog push 50
shades non-toxic hypoallergenic there
you go
when we say the alcohol needs to go yes
definitely says I'm so sick of the same
colors and palettes I would definitely
want to get to that I want to talk about
that specifically about eyeshadow
palettes because I got a thing I cannot
wait to talk to y'all about that let me
let's let's try to go and order though
because I want to want to keep this
organized as much as possible Banshee
news I want parabens back and do not
like the chemicals that have replaced
them yet some people are allergic to
phenoxyethanol which is the big
preservative that replaced parabens the
pair of n scare if you don't know if you
look into it parabens actually unless
you are specifically allergic to them or
you have a sensitive sensitive skin to
them
parabens aren't as bad as they thought
that they were at one point the research
behind it has been proven to even the
people that made the research that
people freaked out about about parabens
have said that it's not what people
turned it into be so the scare about
parabens most of it unless you are
specifically allergic to it is false so
there are a lot of
conceptions about parabens and
especially if you're allergic to
phenoxyethanol I'm sure that that just
made your life ten times harder so yeah
I understand that argument I understand
it for me it doesn't matter to me either
way I don't notice any difference and
that might just be me not knowing about
some things with parabens versus
phenoxyethanol and other preservatives
but I don't notice any difference for me
Nili says I wish they could get together
and find a universal system to make
shade matching online doable that would
be amazing how cool would that be like
if there was a way to have like a
universal almost like batteries you know
like batteries you buy a double-a
battery and you stick it in whatever
machine you need it for whatever you may
need it for and it works you know and
it's universal like how cool would it be
for that for foundations where you know
they they spend some time and they
figured out all you know the complexions
you know kind of like Pantone you know
they figured out all the colors if you
figured out all the colors of people all
of them every one of them and then they
numbered them you know kind of like
Pantone numbers and then you assign
foundations to that number you know and
you could probably go you know a few
numbers one way through numbers another
way like that would be so cool how cool
would that be
watch 2025 it's gonna happen you know
and like every foundation you bought no
matter what brand it was it had a number
on it like you could call it you know
cream or you know whatever color you
want to call it nutmeg or you know
whatever I've heard people of color
complaining about chocolate and nutmeg
and stuff but um you know whatever you
want caught but then it also has a
number on it that could that you know
you would know you know where your range
is that'd be so cool see this is why I
love the collective brain LD Matson one
gen is the first time I've seen you
hello to Canada hello to you Catherine
says looking for a true do be full
coverage foundation seems like most of
them I've tried are at least semi-matte
yeah I mean and also remember you can
always use a luminous primer underneath
that you can use a luminous setting
spray to kind of increase
that luminosity if you choose to to so
that's another option if you just can't
find it
Sammy hi Sammy I want more cruelty free
products stop testing ingredients that
we all know have been around forever I
am with you good morning - Michelle
another one of our wonderful Facebook
hunters good morning to you everybody
benefit needs to come out with more
makeup use trying to find something okay
here we go Beach babe baby Beauty says
for me a clean ingredients for me and
the environment for example no
microbeads exactly and I think
microbeads are being phased out which is
wonderful
who foundations that are part of
skincare and nice comets and blueberries
good point
Tabitha says hi Tom oh my son is calling
me on FaceTime really little boy really
sweetheart I am in live chat right now
it's so cute we're spending the whole
day together were actually on the
celebrating Lila's birthday today she's
having her birthday party today and it's
gonna be so much fun
all right tab she says I want brands to
stop teasing products two years in
advance yeah the one that I think of
when I think of that is to face with
that pie shaped bronzer they must have
teased that like two years ahead I
remember seeing that and thinking about
it and like oh my gosh I wanted I ended
up buying it and returning it good this
is terrible
ELISA I thought it was terrible I didn't
think the pigment came off enough on
there but yeah I hear ya and tab being
tab and and all that she does for the
show I can see why that's annoying for
her alright so we've talked a lot about
foundation let's go ahead and move on
our complexion products let's go ahead
and talk about eyes shadow I really want
to spend some time on eyes shadow
especially eye shadow palettes because
what this is what kind of triggered this
thought of an idea for a for a video for
today was the whole the part I gotta
stop leaning on this chair so that I
don't shake the camera the whole Tarte
April Fool's thing the blue palette if
you didn't see it
Tarte released a like a fake April
Fool's palette and it was all blues
and this beautiful outer packaging and
people were like yes and then they
realized was April Fool's joke and
they're like finally charts releasing
something that isn't brown and it was
joke so then now there's so many
companies that are trying to dupe it
that are you know putting out delivering
products that look very similar but this
is the thing is I feel like if Tarte
actually came out with that I don't
think that there would have been as good
of a reception as there was when it was
a joke and this is why because people
would say it wasn't a complete palette
where is my transition shade well people
know I've been watching Angelica Nyquist
who I know I'm butchering her last name
you know she taught me that you don't
have to have a brown color doesn't have
to be a transition shade she taught me
that you can use a blue for a transition
shade according to her I've tried it and
it actually looks very nice it just has
to be like a you know tonally kind of
similar to your well it has to
transition from one shade to another so
whenever you know the other shade you're
using it would be like a middle shade at
least that's my understanding of it but
I think people would be like what am I
gonna do with all these blues where are
all the other colors what's what's the
deal with all of you know give me some
greens in there more greens give me some
you know maybe some pinks and there are
some Purple's I still don't think that
if that palette came out that people
would have been happy with it I think
people would have said that it's too
blue but because it was joke I think
people this is in my opinion this is why
thing I think people were and I think it
was a surprising and then it was also
the I don't know you know you know I'm
trying to say like I think that people
would have would have been a little more
critical of it so let me see what people
are saying in the chat as far as that
Amanda says Charcot hoes with that joke
so glad others are filling the blue void
this is true and I think blue has become
more popular especially with a warm
crease I've seen that a lot lately and I
personally really like that look where
you have a wooden crease and then you
have either a blue or a green lid it
looks beautiful Susan says could
see in these limited-edition pallets
that these high-end companies dish out
five times a day yeah I hear him
Kahless has some over white-girl pallets
the white chocolate palette and the
Laura Lee's new palette clearly made for
light skin I hear that too
that was my big critique of when I saw
the Laura Lee palette was that where are
like this is going to look really like
it reminded me of like a mix between
like The Naked 3 palette the Urban Decay
Naked 3 palette which was like the the
rose the pinkies and then like the white
chocolate it just seems like it's very
um it would look very I don't know is
actually the right word like it would
look very I don't know like not I don't
know I wish that there were some more
deeper shades and they are whether they
were darker pinks or darker Browns or
darker something would have been nice
just something else yeah because I'm
kind of with you on that one
I do think it looks beautiful I do but
definitely I don't think it would work
for everyone I was a complete pallet but
I remember you're never stuck to one out
you can always venture out into other
palettes as well I think sometimes we
get stuck in that complete palette thing
I want to hear people's thoughts are on
the tart pen yeah the chats going really
fast today isn't it free to be me Barbie
yes it's going very fast oh Naomi's
gonna go exercise by Naomi or it just
says how do people not know you can use
colors those transition shades because
YouTube teaches us that we need a brown
that's why yeah Shelby says you just
need a mid-tone transition oh no it went
all the way down I want to try to find
what people are saying about the Tarte
palette tab says anything can be a
transition shade where is the
okay here we go I found it okay mama
Shana says people love to complain yeah
that's very true queen anna says do you
think people were more upset because
they were tricked I think some of it
yeah definitely
Steph says blue and brown looks money to
me really ha I would love to see a
picture of what you what like a look
that was like an example of that Elise
says hi Elise Elise is one of our
fabulous reporters and she helps with at
least is the one singing in the in the
what you call it the song hopefully you
don't mind me saying that in that in the
Harris Teeter zone but anyway yeah so
Elise is amazing yes it is a creo sorry
I'm getting distracted blue is
definitely increasing popularity I
totally agree I think it's Elise I think
I'm pretty sure it came from Elise I'm
thinking like maybe she had someone else
sing it because I didn't talk to her
personally about it a duochrome palette
Allison says yes Joanne I'd love a color
specific palette that had different
finishes shades and a medium matte Brown
cream in black there you go I'd be
interesting
hi Ileana how are you Ileana has been
around forever doc face says I think the
Davina dupe was sold out so clearly
people were willing to buy yeah it's
true BMAC blues and purples in a palette
together I've been playing with Blues
all week yeah Blues are fun any people
were scared of Blues for a long time
because of like Mimi and like the whole
80s thing with the big hair and the blue
but I think people are starting to
realize we can really build blue in and
make a very modern look
Sussex Andhra says I'm dark-skinned and
I have used blues and purples for
transition yes
there you go teach me your ways no I'm
trying I'm trying to learn I'm working
on it Belinda says totally get what
you're saying Jen if it wasn't joke
people would say where's the Browns it's
true is I think that's true there's so
many comments today oh my gosh Sheila
says transition shades increase shades
are not necessarily the same that's true
because transition shades correct me if
I'm wrong transition shades are when
you're trying to transition from one
color to another it's usually in the
crease because you're transitioning from
your lid to your brow bone area but
crease colors are anything you put in
your crease so you can build other
colors into the crease along with the
transition shade yes I think I'm correct
I hope I'm correct if I'm not I need to
learn he's teach me Julie says copper
and blue together can be stunning I
totally agree Alysia says I want more
options to build my own palette like the
sugar pill or the buxom I think that
would be nice a flat price for palette
and pick the shades yeah I think that's
really smart
Ella says I actually think the Laura Lee
palette was a little different from the
classic palette that we have been seeing
so I was a little happy how it was at
least slightly different and I saw that
too you know that it did seem did seem
like she was trying to give some
different different pumps punches of
color you know like she had the white in
there I don't have it in front of me
right now but I remember seeing that
white standing out some of the shimmer
ease and things like that I'm yeah I'm
gonna I want to get it in my hands so I
don't know if Laura sending at this time
if she doesn't I'm going to try I
haven't heard anything so I'm assuming
she's not setting it so I'm gonna try
really hard to go on and buy it so that
I can review it yeah super Ashley okay I
got it chalky and Ashley okay and we're
going back to that so I did get it right
I just don't want to misspeak
Aspen's says no more limited-edition
pallets and no more high prices on
drugstore pallets that are not worth the
hike in price yeah I mean I will pay
more for something that is worth it
being more whether it's drugstore or
high-end temper if it goes way too far
expensive like I still have trouble I
like cringe like Natasha - no no prices
and visi art prices and patent grass
crisis like it has to be like special
occasion kind of thing for me to like go
that far but they're really good so you
know but as far as like NYX sometimes I
feel like they they push that that price
point and I feel like it might not
really be worth it you know
crafty Claudian says the Laura Lee
palette is beautiful I think it's very
pretty - for the right person I want to
get it on my I want to get on my face I
want it on my face Kayla says I want a
green palette
yes that would be amazing yeah scientist
and makeup says yeah I like Laura but
that palette is not black girl friendly
eye that was one of things I noticed
right away I was like it's beautiful at
first I was thinking about myself and
also call my gosh this is gorgeous I
love these colors like but it reminds me
of the naked 3 so I'm really curious to
put it side-by-side by the naked 3 and
then the next thought after I was
thinking about myself I was like how is
this gonna look on other people I'm not
really sure so we'll see but you can
tell she listen I feel like you can tell
she listened to the feedback on past
pajamas in that there's like a theme for
the whole thing she doesn't have an
obstructed mirror anymore the there's no
like the graphics people didn't like the
flower graphics people liked you know
didn't like that the the cat's pajamas
didn't go with the names of the
eyeshadows and think she changed all of
that you know so I mean I feel like
she's definitely trying to listen to
that feedback Oh Nicole is here hi
Nicole from yearning Nicole hello most
new palette to no longer inspire me yeah
Chelsea says I'm tired of the warm up
tone palettes a naked heat volleyball
slowly grow etc yeah I think that's been
beat to death I am totally with you it
is just it's been beat
there's so many of them out there it's
crazy it's absolutely crazy but I love
you know what I love I love the Anasazi
Beverly Hills specifically with like the
prism and the subculture they really
tried to go out of the box as far as a
shade selection and I personally really
appreciate that I thought that was a
great great thing to do you know to you
know to try to do something different
and you look at that shade selection
when you think about everything that was
coming out at that time all of the warm
the naked heat and all that that warm
and then they came out with these two
totally different palettes I mean I
think that that was really smart of them
and of course they dropped in the the
the newest one that the names flipping
on my hugs I didn't buy it but the new
one that everybody screaming at me what
it is somewhere down lower in the
comments I had to pause the comments cuz
they were just going too fast but yeah
then they'd you threw that one in which
was more of like them weren't
natural-looking colors so but yeah but I
just appreciate that they tried to think
out of the box so what I did was I pause
the chat and I'm just kind of reading up
higher so these comments are all like
older if you're watching live ok so
let's see Mele says I love these bigger
transition shades in the morphe dare to
create which they all did something like
that with the shades you all know we use
up okay cool yeah I haven't I don't have
that in my brain what that looks like
okay I'm trying to find comments that
are like a little bit of there's so many
comments today I'm gonna get to as many
as possible
Saren says listen I think we are past
the point of having original palettes
everything has been made I think more
duo crumbs would be fantastic though I'm
a big duochrome fan I think what the nd
brands are doing as far as bringing out
unique eyeshadow shades I think that
that is that's huge I think that's huge
and I wish that more mainstream brands
would adopt some of those indi concepts
and ideas
Sussex ander says as long as their own
it skipped all the way down I must have
run out of time she said as long as
there's matte shade she can create
transition shades that's awesome it
skipped all the way down I lost it
you too but this is a new chat format
though I don't know what it's gonna do
at any moment kind of new here hello she
says I'm so glad I had the purchase of
the prison in the subculture my big
critiques of those palettes were they
were just for me difficult to work with
because the pigmentation was so intense
you just have to be so careful to barely
tap your brush in and then just blend
your face off not literally but blend
your face off you know and I think that
they work really well and they're not as
easy for me to work with them that I
have to really think about how I want to
put the colors together or else they end
up looking really weird soft glam there
you go Thank You Heather I almost bought
the soft glam then I realized I didn't
really want it that's where I went but
kept seeking videos trying to change my
mind I still resisted so far yeah I
don't I think I'm gonna skip it just
because of that cuz like I'm not gonna
review it everybody and their
grandmother reviewed it and like I just
don't I don't feel like I need it makeup
junkie I think the reason most companies
stick with neutral palettes is they sell
yes I love prism of self culture but I
don't they sell as well I totally agree
with you 100% and I think that's why a
lot of brands go that route you look at
like the mallies of the world and you
know malli I like did you see on the
news today that malli is coming out with
a collection with RuPaul which is really
really smart I hope I hope I hope that
RuPaul pushes for really really high
quality products because I feel like
malli falls flat
a lot of times especially in their
eyeshadow like powder product game if
you like they have good eyeliners like I
love their pencil eyeliners and some of
their lip products are pretty good but I
feel like their powder product game is
weak from what I've tried the eyeshadows
the blushes things like that so I'm
hoping RuPaul really pushes for a
formula change and I can't imagine why
that wouldn't happen I mean I'm crossing
my fingers let's see yeah Katie says I
agree don't need more major unicorns or
limited edition palettes or that come
out every two seconds let me enjoy
palette with great ingredients for a
minute
area I totally hear you Ella says I
would love more duo chromes me too
Maryellen after 60 she says I love the
Kat Von D shade light palette has so
many transition shades that's true and
anybody can use that thing like I really
at least it seems like that from the
videos that I've watched it seems like
everybody can watch it suraÃ­h says
Thomas Albert mentioned that if a BH did
a colorful palette with their own
formula that would be amazing in your
Vina said she was going to work on it
twice well she should she should I mean
I feel like the modern renaissance
formula was really good and I don't know
why they went into this super intensely
pigmented formula I guess they were just
trying to improve on the modern
Renaissance but I feel like the modern
renaissance formula was like that was it
that was that was it that was the thing
do that do that more I'm with Thomas on
that one Nadine I love duo chrome so
pleased not glittery metallic and and
smooth yeah please not glittery she
wants metallic and smooth I'm with you
yeah I'm with you
I think glittery has its place but I
feel like metallic and smooth is my
preference as well oh these hear from
feet dreamcatcher and then it went away
let me see if I can find what she was
saying have you seen the and then I lost
it oh oh this new chat there it is oh
wait no she said so pumped for the
RuPaul collection he says you don't know
V from be dreamcatcher she's amazing
I lost it it's just this is this new
chat is like confusing me because all of
a sudden it just pops down to the bottom
like I don't know where I have it pause
and then it just disappears and I never
know when it's gonna happen so okay so
let's go ahead and let's go ahead and Oh
Serena says hi Jen just wanted to say
thank you for your videos have a nice
day you have a nice day too thank you
alright
let's go ahead and move on to like cheap
products let's talk about blush
highlight contour what is it that we
want what is it that we don't want what
are we done with for me personally I
prefer a more neutral contour I feel
like there's a lot of brands that market
contour with warm shades specifically
and that personally doesn't work for me
like I can do a little bit of warmth but
once it gets into like that starting to
get orange zone I can't wear it anymore
and I know some people can totally rock
it and then I feel like there's less
offerings for cool contours like people
that need something cool so I personally
would rather see like more neutral you
know and then multiple shades of it you
know in like a neutral shade that's just
me and as far as blush I personally my
favorite blush formulas are like the
satiny formulas that are like those
mommy colors those are my favorites but
I feel like there's only so much
creativity we can get in blushes
highlighters and contours before it
starts getting crazy like all the
Unicorn mermaid highlighters I feel like
they're good for like those creative
looks but if you're just going into the
grocery store and you know you've got
this like iridescent highlight on like
you can you can totally do it but it's
like you know I feel like it's more
special occasion if that makes sense but
of course you can do whatever makes you
happy so let's say OC people are saying
okay Gillian says contouring is to
create depth and warmth does not exist
yes and I feel like some people though
even though you know wouldn't you think
of a contour and I said this I have a
contouring like 101 kind of video of how
I contour and contour is supposed to be
a shadow and shadow doesn't have warmth
to it it's just like a gray color so but
I feel like when you have cast a shadow
on a really warm skin tone you do end up
with a warmer contour color that's just
you know what my nan makeup professional
brain tells me so I feel like warm
contours do work for some people it's
supposed to be creating depth but I feel
like that depth can be
on someone that is really warm if I'm
going right that's Justin but again not
makeup artist that's just from what I've
learned and seen Kate says yes you could
actually use bronzer in there if there
were pale cool tones yes exactly
Kristin says I like the wet sheen look
as highlighters me too like the a more
easy highlighter I feel like does that
Georgia says no glittery bronzers or
contours please yeah I don't like
glittery bronzers that I am NOT a fan of
glittery bronzers at all spot glitter
contour is not even a thing anybody ever
seen a shadow that was glittery that'd
be interesting
that'd be interesting no glitter and
highlights yeah I'm not a fan of glitter
and highlights and that's why I don't I
don't prefer the artist for ones I feel
like there's too much glitter in them
for me personally if I was going to the
club I would be all about it but since I
don't go to the club anymore I just feel
like it looks weird on me glitter in
highlights I like the shine exactly Jan
is it wait
it looks like Gianna because it looks
like gene Gina oh my gosh he's spelling
sometimes they get me I'm gonna say
Gianna and I hope that I'm right I'm
crossing my fingers
avi says I hate super pigmented contours
personally I want something that's
buildable not super intense because I
tend to go too far way too early yes I
feel like sometimes brands especially
like I've noticed this like CD color
they just pack the punch in their face
products and there are blushes and their
contours the the the blush formula in my
opinion the contour formula should be
very different from an eyeshadow formula
eyeshadow formula I want it to really
punchy really good like BAM in your face
but like a blush and a contour I feel
like should be less pigmented it should
be buildable I am totally with you I
feel like it's much much easier to work
with
frog push says get better undertones
orange and gray is what I see and hate
yeah and I think that works for some
people put it we nice to have like a
gradient I'm with you Laura says I'm
really over contour palettes because
it's never useful for one person yeah
and I feel like the contour palette
thing like I'm trying not to buy any
more contour palettes because like
you're
I usually end up only using like one or
two shades in the whole palette unless
I'm using it for eyes like I try to use
them for eyes too so that I end up doing
that Steph says no more bronzer being
sold as contour yes Shauna says I wish I
could get my blushes to last have you
tried the bums insane blushes those
things are ridiculous those are my
favorite long-lasting blushes that's
that's me a little of them Julie says I
would love to have an empty palette and
then I could add my own contour
highlight blush bronzer shade yes that's
so smart oh my gosh Julie so smart Laura
says no more skip down again Laura skip
down again step says highlight four
black diamonds and pearls hello good to
see you again I hate red bronzer it
looks like I have an allergic reaction
yeah we're really orange tone yeah that
does not work for me either
vol vol says I use black radiance
contour palette it's nice I'm never
trying to Black Radiance contour palette
I'll have to check it out
bancini is I like bareMinerals bronzers
I don't think I'm not sure why we're
trying bareMinerals bronzer not sure
good morning to Monica Joe says no more
highlighters being sold as blush I'm 47
we don't need so much shimmer yeah and I
think that like you have to go where
your comfort zone is no matter what your
age is and I feel like sometimes like we
are told as people that are a little bit
older I mean I'm so I'm would be 40 in a
couple months oh my gosh
June 8th I'll be 40 where did the time
go
you know like as you're going through it
it seems like it's taking forever then
you look back and it's like where did it
go where did the time go
but like I'm thinking like 40 plus you
know sometimes I feel like we you know
I'm putting myself there even you know
35 plus I think sometimes we put
ourselves in this box that says because
I'm this age I can't do this and I think
that it's no matter what your age is
whether you're a teen whether you're in
your 20s you're 30 to 40 50 60 70 s 80s
you have to do what makes you happy and
what makes you comfortable so you know I
think that there's definitely a market
for highlighters being more
subtle and blushes that have that shine
on them I think it just depends on also
your complexion to whether you have a
lot of texture because shine tends to
accentuate texture and if you don't want
that in your life I feel like you know
no matter what your age that that may
not be a product that you would feel
comfortable wearing maybe so yeah I
definitely hear you about the
highlighter blush combo thing I do think
it looks really pretty on some people so
I think it just depends on you know who
you are and everything but I totally
hear you and especially when it's
marketed as a blush but then you get it
home and it's like this is kind of a
highlighter it's got a lot of shine in
it you know and this is beyond the satin
finish I'm talking about like a shine
Heather says Alucard face palette yes
that would be amazing
yes Jessica's my odd skip down again
Becky says my birthday is June 8th -
we'll be twinsies Hot Fuzz wait we're
gonna give that me 40 - we were born on
the same day how amazing is that that's
so cool Allison says you're beautiful in
32 tops thank you much appreciated
possum ik fart pants I love that name I
was that way with fashion hair color I
dyed my hair every color when I was
younger and then it third was like I'm
too old for this now I'm 40 and I'm like
I don't give him it makes me happy you
should do what makes you happy and when
I guess it was
you guys remember people that have been
around for a while when I had my hair
red on the bottom and I had a lot of
people telling me that I shouldn't have
done that because I'm too old for it or
you know whatever and I love my red hair
and then when I made it purple like I
love the purple for like the two weeks
that it stayed I think you should do
what makes you happy absolutely Julie
says even when I'm 90 I will have
colorful wrinkles me too me and you
Julie we're gonna have coffee for
wrinkles more more high fives there
Elise says I'm 47 I will do what I want
highlighter to the heavens and glitter
shimmer on my eyes do what makes you
happy and what makes you comfortable
absolutely oh my gosh
Jean aid for hot mess money no hi miss
mama MD is June 8 - I'm
what time was my I think I was born it
to something so I'm like couple hours
older than you
that's so funny are you but you're not
gonna be 40 though I think we're
different ages but still that's so cool
lots of June 8 babies oh my gosh is
Jessica's birthday today happy 25th
birthday Jessica free free to be me
Barbie says yes and over spring on
products to fool the customers yes oh my
gosh Physicians Formula
stop with the overspray it's beautiful
but it just it's it's like it lasts well
like two seconds and it's like what
happened to what I thought you know when
you think it's gonna be embedded in the
product but it's just an overspray so
annoying so annoying I'm surly with you
let's see oh it skipped down again
goodness gracious
yep Stacy says my best friend's 56 and I
dyed her hair purple last year do what
you want yes Cynthia says I love it I
thought you should do it again I think
I'm done with that I finally got it to
grow out it finally grew out and I'm
really happy that it's grown out so I
was kind of done with it but now I got
hair I got hair extension thingies I got
a halo at a time at that you can see and
what's it been makeup today and I love
my new halo hair like it is so pretty
it's real hair and I've pictures of it
on Twitter I asked people if I should
get it and everybody was like yeah I get
it not everybody but I would say 90%
people told me to get it and it just
makes me feel so much more confident and
happy and like what push me over the
edge I had all these feels saying it was
Jackie and it came on and was like it
looks good and I was like okay Jackie is
like the queen of like wigs and hair
extensions although she knows all that
stuff stuff Jackie says it looks good I
know that this is gonna be a good thing
but I mean it was the plethora of people
that told me that it looked good kind of
pushed me over with it but yeah so if
you see my hair looking not like this
and looking more full and longer like
down here it's not real hair but it's
because it makes me feel happy and
confident you know like it I think you
have to do what makes you feel happy and
confident no matter what that is whether
it you know you want to get Botox or if
you want to you know wear crazy and you
know not crazy crazy is not the right
word but if you want to wear like super
super bold color eye looks or a big bold
lip or if you just want to wear some
natural look you have to do what makes
you feel confident and comfortable
right so let's see okay so let's go back
into the complexion not complexion parts
the the cheek products and see if
there's anything else I want to move on
in about two minutes two lip products
and that would be our last area of the
discussion Sarah Anne says I'm seriously
looking forward to having sexy sovereign
Grey older I'm going to rock it yeah you
are I'm sure you will yes Alison says
show us I will show you I'm gonna do a
and IMATS haul and I'll show you the
whole thing I don't have it in here it's
actually my bathroom the other room but
I will show you free to me be me Barbie
says my hair is naturally gray I have
Gray's I don't know if you can see them
but there yeah there they are they're
shining you can see them a little bit
they're there they're there all right so
let's go ahead let's go ahead and talk
it into lip products because I feel like
we're kind of done with the cheek
products it seems like the conversation
is dying down on that so let's talk
about lip products what do we want and
lip products and what do we not want and
lip products what are we done with and
Stephanie says I'm tired of dry butthole
lips no more liquid lipsticks I think
all I want is regular lipsticks Sheila
says no more long wear liquid lipsticks
this is so funny I did not expect that
oh my gosh
Allison says I'm excited glosses are
coming back me too I would not expect oh
my gosh - money rachel says more juicy
glosses at least glosses Jessica I'm
done with the liquid lips mr. Ashton I
agree with Stephanie Banshee news I'm
done with dry lips death to the matte
lip Nadine said I miss mama FD yes I'm
done with dry lips oh my gosh too funny
oh my gosh you know this is the thing
with liquid lipsticks I feel like
there's some really good liquid lipstick
formulas that dry down they aren't ultra
really horribly dry I think it's just
the really dry ones that I personally
can't do like I loved when Lindsay came
over and did my goth makeover
that cat Fonzie liquid lipstick that I
was wearing I was not a fan of that
formula it took me like I don't know at
least five minutes to do my lips and
then she still had to help me with it
because the lip line was off like she
still had it was it was so incredibly
dry and uncomfortable really don't like
Kat Von D liquid lipstick formula I know
a lot of people love them I personally
do not love them the Stila ones the
Anastasio ones I can't do it they are so
dry then Nick's lip look the lingerie
ones like oh my gosh they're so dry but
then there's some liquid lipstick
formulas that I really really like like
we'll talk about I have my covergirl box
like I was saying I have that review i'm
swatching everything for you with the
lip products um I feel like those are
better actually they're not terrible
especially the Queen ones that I'm going
to show you one of those has become like
a like I want to wear it every single
day I'll show you that I'm gonna get to
the video but they they dry down and
want a liquid lipstick to dry down but
not so that I can feel it all day long
I want my lips to feel like my lips not
like I have a coating of lipstick on
them and some of them are like that
we'll talk about it but like for example
I love the Ophir ones I feel like the
Ophir ones have that nice they don't dry
down completely but they've got that
nice comfortable feel and then peace the
solo look ones the ones that they did
with de peche girl
what is her cryptic cosmetics is her
brand those are really nice they're very
thin so you don't feel that film but
they do dry down completely and they're
opaque for being such a thin formula I'm
surprised at how opaque they are but
they're really really good the cryptic
cosmetics ones and the solo look ones
are the same formula because they work
together on them oh by the way
oh wait I'm not allowed I'm not sure if
I'm allowed to say anything as far as
the soul look stuff let me look and see
if they put it on their Instagram they
put on their Instagram I will try to
hold on I'm gonna look because I want to
tell you something but I don't know if
I'm allowed to say anything yet with the
solo look faint hold on I have to look
because I really want to tell you okay
sorry those of you that are watching on
the replay I'm thinking of you I'll try
to make this as short as possible
okay it doesn't look I can tell you darn
up okay
but anyway something really exciting
with solar look coming out soon that all
tell you as soon as I can but it's not
on their Instagram yet so I don't want
to you know say anything yet but keep an
eye out that but anyway liquid lipsticks
those are really good and then I like
ones that don't dry down completely like
the the em cosmetics ones and the bare
minerals ones that don't dry down there
like that whippy formula I personally
really like those it almost is like to
me a melted regular stick lipstick it's
just melted down until the Oakwood for
me it's almost the same as a regular
stick lipstick as far as the you know
the comfort of them alright let's see
what the community is saying I'm gonna
scroll up a little bit Cindy says Rimmel
lipsticks are nice Jessica
Oprah's are the best but I find that
they need they tend to move slightly
because of it but as long as I am NOT
going for a super dark with them they
seem to be okay Sarah and YSL lipstick I
have not tried those mr. Ashton lips
that Queen - I like the lipstick queen
lipsticks they're a little bit drier
than I like but I do I do like them a
lot
Jenna yes the bare minerals are the best
but they don't last though that is very
true Rachael a big fan of the Revlon
gloss treat for the fenty gloss balm I
want to try the Alyssa Ashley elf one
that one is supposed to be a good 50
gloss balm dupe and I'm really also
really really happy to see glosses
coming back there was a really long time
I didn't wear glosses it wasn't a thing
and the more I've been wearing them the
more I have been absolutely loving
glosses really and truly they're just so
comfortable you know sir I says galactic
ones are good too I'm hoping I'm saying
your name right because I had a old
YouTube friend who now does ASMR she has
the same spelling and she pronounces her
name Sarai and I really I but I feel I
really feel like regular lipsticks lasts
longer sometimes definitely you know
what regular lipsticks I really like her
the Patton graph ones I know they're
really pricey but they last forever on
me for ever Michelle says I can't wait
for Stephanie Nicole to start her lip
reviews again yes I hope she does I hope
she does cuz they're so good there's so
good Debra says what's with all the lip
toppers I hate layering yeah
I you know I personally really like like
the whole hombre thing like I like doing
the darker lip and then putting lighter
in the center I don't mind doing a
little bit of layering with my lip
products but I get you with the lips
hoppers and one thing I hate about lip
toppers is they but when they blend into
the lip so you like put them on you've
got this nice iridescent shine and it
looks so good and then you go like this
because you're talking and then the
iridescent shine goes away it just all
blends in it's like my shine I hope I
took a picture before you know so I'm
definitely with you on that and then
also when lip toppers have glitter in
them and then the lip product wears away
but you've still got glitter like stuck
to your lip just random pieces of
glitter on your natural lip color not a
fan of that Domino Elle I'm tired of
nudes being nude for everyone but not
for darker girls yes I don't like that I
don't like the word nude for for because
I knew whenever you see nude you always
and this is that person always hates it
when I say this I'm sorry I hate it when
nude is this color because not everybody
is this color when you're new give me a
deep deep brown and call it nude have
you took at like at least sometimes at
least every once in a while you know I
don't know or just throw away that word
altogether unless it's going to be
arranged like nude medium and deep food
I think I said that in a video ones page
actually like the l'oreal to
particularly the chocolate scented ones
that we're at Target I also like the
covergirl lip I saw those on L'Oreal
ones I thought about getting them but I
didn't oh it's skipped down again Thai
okay Ella
I love liquid lipsticks for restaurants
because I'm so self-conscious when my
lipstick transfers onto my cup oh there
you go
see like I I like like I what I don't
like when I go to restaurants is what
I'm wearing a deep color and like it
wears away right here and I'm like
talking and then I go like oh excuse me
I have to go to the restroom and I look
at the restroom and I like have lip
color just here on the outsides and
nothing in the middle and it's like I've
been talking like that for how long and
I find that seems to happen more with
liquid lipsticks than regular lipsticks
so I personally I'll usually I guess
it's I guess it's whatever is your pet
peeve I don't mind of lipstick transfers
to whatever I'm sure
hang on I would rather have it all over
my lips but I totally get that I get
that too it's all personal preferences
Debra says I can't wear nude lipsticks
unless I want to look like a corpse yeah
I find that they don't look good on me
at all like the really light nudes but I
love the way light nudes look on a
deeper skin tone I think they're
beautiful like when someone with a
really deep skintone wears like a pale
really really pale light nude lip I
think it looks beautiful
Abbi and one day we had hi a bi we're
liquid lipsticks when I sing or when I'm
in shows because I don't want to worry
about my lips being sticky when I'm
trying to perform there you go yes
absolutely and but I think some liquid
lipsticks like I tried those Lottie
London ones oh they were terrible I
don't know why I didn't make a video on
those they were awful they were so
sticky like it was like like like I
couldn't get my lips apart without my
let's like pulling it was awful so
definitely no sticky lip sticky lips are
bad
sticky lips are terrible oh hi Canon she
says I refuse to wear anything that
transfers I get it all over the place on
fingers on clothes etc so you are a lips
liquid lipstick girl then swing says you
just have to find your perfect nude
color yes I agree nicole says you just
have to do what the Royals do and sip
the drink the same spot that's one of
their rules really you have to it's kind
of sip yeah I guess that would work
Allison says hi Allison I don't think I
officially said hello to Allison hello
Allison the Knicks of matte lip colors
are good at cherry skies is such a pre
red it doesn't budge ever nice good to
know staff my natural lips have zero
color they're like a blue color so
finding my perfect nude is impossible
I'm sure it's not impossible don't give
up yet don't give up
Ilyana says I like the retro mattes from
Mac because I know they won't go all
over my teeth oh my gosh lipstick on the
teeth oh oh my goodness I know I did
these lip swatch
lips watch stuff from the covergirl line
and I'm so I haven't looked at the
footage yet but I would I'm sure there's
gonna be lipstick on my teeth at least a
couple of times so what do we want and
let's do we want work we like the
glosses we don't like the dry sticky
crackling mattes we want something more
comfortable and I noticed that too Manny
MUA on twitter has been asking I guess
he's developing I'm guessing he's
developing a liquid lipstick formula
where he asked people whether people
want liquid lipstick formula that dries
down completely and is more dry or
something that's more hydrating and
transfers and the majority every time he
asks I think he's asked like three times
people have said they want it more
comfortable and transfers anna says the
fenty red lip is phenomenal good to know
Stef says it's embarrassing when my
lipstick wears off because I've zero
color my lips no seriously I counted
over 20 nudes a couple weeks ago they
all look awful my search continues
ringing Lee's stuff man
that makes me sad well hopefully I will
be thinking of you and I hope that you
all are able to find one soon 70 says I
love a really pigmented gloss me too
maybe more pigmented glosses would be a
good thing you know like where you
really see a good bit of pigment in the
gloss the only thing I get nervous about
is like the whole lip stain thing like I
get like this crack here in the middle
of my lips all the time and like when I
get like a stain like a that is when it
settles into my crack right here and I
get like my lips are dry I don't like
that so you have to there's like a fine
line between like too pigmented and that
it's gonna accentuate any like I'm not
in perfection but in like any dry spots
gotta be careful but pigmented gloss yes
Stephanie absolutely Sheila says even
though I don't buy them I don't like lip
palettes I don't like lip pellets either
because I feel like lip palettes are for
makeup artists I feel like that is the
purpose of a lip palette is a makeup
artist or someone that does it has a big
person though they mind carrying with
them but I don't I don't buy lip
palettes I don't find them to be
functional in my life I am totally with
you Sheila Sheila's been around forever
- I love you Sheila Sheila's also
bubbles Hill says julep has darker
glosses they do I really like their I
like their
like with lipstick formula I liked their
class formula jessica says a thin loss I
can't stand thick ones I don't like
glosses to be super heavy and sticky
autumn Becca beach tints aren't drawing
and they're comfortable nobody ever
talks about them they're long wearing
and they don't settle thank you so much
for that autumn much appreciated
diva says a bitch glosses are really
pigmented thank you for that Rebecca I
lost Rebecca this thing skipping down is
really annoying since sometimes super
opaque glosses bleed on me at the
formulas then that's a really good point
to when the hates lip palettes - amber
I'm the new L'Oreal color riche lipstick
glosses are amazing that's good to know
I haven't tried those either Jenna
doesn't like lip palette see there hello
Jenna Gina says not interested in lip
brushes we have enough brushes I hate
lip brushes I try I don't like I know
they're functional I know there's a
purpose to them I know that they should
I should like lip brushes I find it to
be an extra step and I guess because I
wear a lot of colors that are closer to
my skin tone as far as tone like I don't
wear a lot of darker colors that I don't
feel like I need them as much but then
then I go and I move into a deeper color
and it's like mess all over my face oh
because I didn't use a lip liner and I
didn't use a lip brush that's why so I
think they had their purpose but I
prefer not to use them I am with you
Gina
Diana's talking about a BH what do you
tell hi Diana
I'm not sure which one she's talking
about though about a BH yes Jenna says I
use the lip brushes for detailing my
eyes well good for you that's an art
Naomi says I literally use a synthetic
artist brush as a lip brush which I
would imagine would be fine to use
absolutely Andy says I'd rather use my
fingers and a brush is good for
precision I have trouble with precision
with my fingers I do and I like I was
big on using my finger tip to apply
another's eyes but to apply like
shimmery shades on my lid but I realized
I can't get in the corners without
getting it up here and over here so what
I've been doing lately with my eyes is
patting it on to the center of my lid
with my finger and then using a really
small detail brush so
get it into the inner corners and then
you know trying to just kind of blend it
a little bit to try to get the color and
same thing for the lips like I feel like
like my fingers like don't get it
precise I personally really like the lip
liquid lipstick doe foot applicator is I
feel like those a lot of times are
really good except for from me like I
know some people really like these but
you know the doe foot applicator xand
lip brush lip products that have like
the little well in them that hold extra
product I find that to be a lot of times
extra messy like sometimes it applies
too much product I would rather have a
doe foot applicator just a regular one
so I can get that you know my Cupid's
bow up here really easily and just kind
of detail around there like that's a lot
easier than the ones that are like extra
special fancy or whatever that's just me
and my lips everybody's look shape is
different I think that contributes to it
too
Marie says Marc Jacobs glosses are bomb
awesome let's skip down again Alice and
the NYX ultimate butter glosses are so
pretty I just discovered them I use
their matte lip pencils all over skip a
lipstick and apply the gloss over top
that's really smart
I want to start doing that too I haven't
bought a NYX lip butter probably for
years I had to throw them away but the
ones I had because they were old but I
really liked them I really like them
Emma says this is off topic but sponge
tip applicator czar underrated and I
know there was like that big sponge tip
applicator thing when simply no logical
did these sponge tip applicator thing I
can't use sponge tip applicator --zz I
can't use them they feel terrible oh my
eye I know they work but like I don't
feel like they pick up enough like
product for me like I'm not patient
enough and I don't like the way they
feel so I don't like sponge tip
applicator but I know they work really
well for a lot of people I know
Stephanie Nicole uses them I know a lot
of people do use them I can't do it my
friend Amy who works at our tattoo
studio she introduced me years ago I was
like I was watching because of her she's
an artist she's amazing she's sad she
was she's an incredible artist in
general and one day she came to the
studio and she was didn't have any
makeup on and I we sat and talked well
she did her eyeshadow and she pulls out
the sponge tip applicator zhh and I was
like Amy please don't tell me that's all
you use a sponge tip applicator she
like yeah that's all I use I was like
you've gotta be kidding me like the eye
looks you create she's not even that
into makeup the eye look she creates
with sponge tip applicator x' are you
doing I need to try to convince her to
do like a makeup Instagram because she's
ridiculous she's sober days and she
doesn't even really do makeup them on
she does it just for you know in
addition to everything else she does but
you know you can create some beautiful
looks with sponge applicators I just
personally don't like them I don't like
them but anyway we gotta go
unfortunately this was a great chat I
was a little worried we wouldn't have
enough talk about but y'all never let me
down you all in the collective brain is
amazing absolutely amazing and I would
really like to focus the live streams on
things like this rather than me giving
information like for example like halls
and things like that like I've got a
bunch of stuff to show you but I'd
rather do that in like smaller live
streams that are you know meet more me
talking and less community focus I feel
like the best community ones are when we
have discussions like this where we kind
of have a topic and we kind of go back
and forth and give our thoughts and
opinions I don't love that I feel like
that's super beneficial so look out for
faster live streams this week on my
IMATS haul my Sephora haul and then I
have my Etsy bag I want to put those up
I don't know when they're going to be
probably during the day time during the
week at some point but I've got a super
super busy week this week lots of stuff
going on not not necessarily village the
YouTube channel but just in my general
life so but yeah thank you so much for
being here I hope you love the live
stream of I'm glad that it sounds like
the quality is much better just know if
you were upset with me last week that
was never my intention to have bad audio
like when I say people were upset like
people were mad and I felt really bad so
just know I didn't do it on purpose and
I'm really really sorry and hopefully
it's better now and I don't have to
spend a lot of money on another
microphone hopefully everything's good
now but if it's not I will try to
continue to improve it so thank you
again for being here Matt love to you
have a wonderful week and we will see
you hopefully for an evening live chat
next week that'll be the plan since it's
the last Sunday of the month so yeah
have a great week and lots of exciting
things coming out on the channel this
week and who
please stay tuned mad love touches
