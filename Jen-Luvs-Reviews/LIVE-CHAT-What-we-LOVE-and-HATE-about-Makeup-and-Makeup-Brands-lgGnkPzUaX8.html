the make up chat I'm so happy to be back
trying to get my hair do not look so
frizzy but I didn't really do it today
so it is what it is because you know in
life you don't have to look perfect all
of the time and it's perfectly okay
don't let anybody convince you of
anything different in this day and age
of social media where we're looking at
all these people that are filtered and
look perfect all the time I want to
share with you that it is in my opinion
okay to not worry about looking perfect
all of the time just a little pearl for
you there so anyway today we're gonna be
talking about things we love about
makeup and things we hate about makeup
those things that make our hearts
pitter-patter and give us the tingles
and then things that were like are you
kidding me
are you flipping kidding me this is
horrible because us makeup lovers we
have a passion for these things we have
a passion for our products we have a
passion for they're applying our makeup
and and the way that it makes us feel
when we do so when a product performs
well it can make us feel a certain way
or when it doesn't it can make us feel a
certain way and we can even extend this
to the way that brands behave and things
that brands do or things we're noticing
on YouTube I'd really just want to have
a fun conversation with the community
where it's not just me talking about my
opinion which is the way that I feel
like a lot of these chats have been very
focused on me I want this to be more
community based so if you're watching
this on the replay thank you so much for
watching you can feel free to leave your
thoughts down in the comments below even
if you leave you know as you're watching

you're watching don't feel like you need
to compile them all into one comment
whatever makes you comfortable do you
want to start your own little thread
that's totally fine whatever you like to
do commenting on the things that we're
discussing the major focus today is
going to be on the collective brain of
makeup optimist also known as the people
who are here in lie
chat this morning at 10 a.m. Eastern
Time on Sunday is when we typically do
our live chat this could have been an
evening chat but because I didn't plan
ahead I didn't want to spring mine on
everybody I'm really really hoping you
have a evening chat at the end of August

posted you know not everybody can get
there 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time it's very
early for some people some people are at
church events things like that so anyway
I'm gonna take a quick second to say
hello to the people that are here I am
going to be telling you if you're
watching some of your play I am going to
be reading you what they say so you feel
like you're in the dark as far as that
and will be able to learn a lot from
them today so let me go ahead and go
over to the live chat and we're going to
scroll all the way to the top and say

bit of trouble reading the comments from
where they are let me see if oh my gosh
okay so hopefully I'll be able to read
the comments because my contact lenses
are totally work so let's go ahead and
start with products and the way that
products misbehave on us I think a fun
one to start with or behave on us things
we love what's some things we love I
before it's not have to fight oh I can't
you're making it too confusing
tell them happy happy birthday to
justice Michelle wants me to sing happy
birthday justice happy birthday Justin
um okay anyway let's let's just get into
products because I know people watching
the replay look what is going on with
this girl okay so let's talk about lip
products and things we love about lip
products what is it then you love for me
the thing that I love most about a lip
product is how it goes on nice and soon
right right it's not it's gonna sound
like like adult language for a minute it
goes on so nice and smooth and like you
don't have to pull on your lips to get
it to apply and then feeling that
hydration you know like feeling like my
lips or have like like what the lipstick
is giving them a life or the lip balm is
giving them life no those are the things
that were like yes we need it make you
go yes
love to know five-o you know what I'm
almost said FISA and I did okay
that's now been cleared up okay anyway
so what are the things that you all love
about lip public what makes you like the
shine and hydration Dunn says AJ says
same thing love a moisturizing lipstick
the lipstick I'm wearing today is by
colored brain and it's one of their
liquid lipsticks and I want to say it's
sugar something I have but it's a lot
okay yeah here it is
I shut my little table and I spill my
coffee a little bit it's called brown
sugar and this is what it looks like I
really do like color green liquid
lipsticks they're not the most hydrating
in the world but they do feel very good
for a liquid lipstick they're not
transfer proof at all they don't dry
down completely I really like it a lot I
like their a but I like but I don't mind
that no liquid lipstick okay let's see
what else is going on Julianna says hi
Jenna I love you I love you too ginger
says I tried one of
Kiko's lipsticks and it was okay a
little patchy could be because it was a
dark red and nail polish I'm still
playing the big gotcha
God it's had with her thank you and then
Shani says I love how lip products
complete the look yes and I am a big fan
look I always put my lipstick on last
because I feel like that's what kind of
brings it all together is like the lip
product it's like mine actually that's
not sure I don't always put a little s
and do my cheek sputters but I do feel
like it does kind of bring everything
together
I do like putting on my lipstick before
my cheek products I feel like my
lipstick makes a difference in the
choice that I do with my cheeks I mean
like one with the eyes we do to the lips
which leave me tip sheets but sometimes
the cheeks lead me to the lips I don't
know I guess it just depends on what
people are doing for that day Billy says
that I love lipstick with a good smell I
know I'm the minority you know what I
like lipsticks with a good smell to the
only ones I don't like or like the
Milani lip sticks where it's so
incredibly strong it makes me kind of
roll look it's just too much
and those kind of pull on my lips to
which I don't particularly enjoy
especially as they get a little older I
feel like they lose hydration from
Milani lipsticks
Cristina says for me it's how close my
mole look together yes mansion who says
I like lip products that make my lips
feel plump and not drive out freeze yes
girlfriend gasps jessica says color you
have the perfect color for sharing
absolutely look at that um you know when
you get like they don't know I've always
been a big fan of colors in general like
just just seeing all different colors
and having the colors all lined up and
seeing all the pretty colors loose said
the bite agave lip mask yes and then
somehow I just skipped all the way down
I lost my place stupid chat window
lasting power for Kylie yes a lot of
people are in love with the lasting
power that's not the thing for me but I
totally get that the lasting power
juliana says long-lasting no pain no
gain
and we think chief says I am tired of
lip products fading disappear so attempt
and not even wearing the most of the
time yeah I totally hear you
Debbie loves a bold lip absolutely so
let's talk about some of the things that
we hate about lip products some of the
things were like these are the things
that make me just go I never wonder
where lip products again just like she
was just saying you know like the things
they're just really you know and for me
the biggest thing 90 feet about lip
products is that when it's like
something about like lip product coming
off really versus me like when I went to
generation beauty in Toronto I got my
lips done at the Smashbox studio that
they had there and I had glitter all
over my bottom lip and I kept eating
little pieces of glitter and it reminded
me when you go to the beach you've ever
been to the beach and you get sand in
your mouth and then like an hour later
you accidentally chomp piece of sand
that's the way the glitter lips were
like on you look I don't like things
falling off of my lips they don't like
flaking
like I'll deal with it wife it's cool
but it's not something that I would
choose to do like before I change too
lips more often and like yeah I could I
do like the way it looks but just the
chomping on the glitter so what do you
guys hate about lip I said what's your
pet peeve liquid lipsticks one I meant
let me sing let's go up I hate when you
try and dry your lips at me actually
look dried yes Trish says butthole lips
absolutely wasn't all puckered Cindy
says I hate my lip products except for
Oprah AJ says I hate telling when you
reapply and uneven wear yuck like when
you when you apply a liquid lipstick and
then you apply it over it and it starts
like bubbling up like not bubbling but
like like getting like little pieces
everywhere that's what happened to me
with the makeup heat liquid lipsticks
even just the second coat of it like it
was just done a lot of liquid lipsticks
who do not lair well but the ones that
do are but if they you know wearing like
your lipsticks is probably not the best
idea overall but some of them they are
really well but if they don't it's
disgusting I'm totally with you go
liquid lipstick that makes your lips
feel and look like used sandpaper yes
Karen says just put my coffee on woke up
late I'm glad you didn't issue I'm glad
you're here too sherry says anything
that is super stickier fades funny oh
yeah let's super sticky like what was it
the real her liquid lipsticks you know
went like this
and my lips were actually like you could
see them pulling against each other like
it was just the stickiest thing ever and
like lip glosses too you know what I
hate about lip glosses is when my hair
flies and my lip gloss and like drags it
all back for like a really like wet and
lipstick where it like just goes show
and it gets all over my face
mm-hmm but that's not necessarily the
products while that seems with the wings
fall but still I don't like that Sabrina
says I hate sticky lipstick oh yeah me
too Pfizer says the sticky liquid lips
the dry crunch and feel because of
flaking annoys me so much honestly
somebody sits in the austalia and then I
lost them them oh man Erica says lips
sets latina says who Lee Anne I think
your color choices look beautiful today
I hate I hate when I see lips
on my forehead oh my gosh sometimes I'd
film latina and wooly Oh sometimes I
film and I realize halfway through the
video like how people video that I have
lipstick on my head like maybe i
swatched something and like what like
this i know what's happening chat before
when I realized it my video that did
really really well recently the five
reasons why youtubers succeed on YouTube
or whatever it was uh I always forgot I
can be big but if you look really
carefully like right here on my head
there is like a little bit of makeup and
there's a piece of hair that's like
stuck to it and when I was editing I was
like oh but then I know one's mentioned
it like no one's noticed that so now you
guys know to look for it I don't know I
noticed it did I just put lipstick on
Jamie says especially when lipsticks
bleed and pill into the corner here now
oh that's the worst when they're like
they're like pools up here and you don't
realize that well I'm an awesome lip
primer will keep any liquid lip from you
drying yes what is your favorite
actually I would love to know if you're
watching some replays well what are some
lip primers that you really really love
I like the bite Beauty I think that
one's a really good game Xavier says oMG
desert let scrapped in dark AF yes Heidi
says lipstick on the teeth and bleeding
into fine lines so yup yes when um when
I went downstairs before I started
filming my husband he's like the
girlfriend you got lipstick girls like
that looks at me too
okay I don't but that's the worst
especially if it's been a while since
you've applied it and it's been a while
since you've applied it and you're like
not even thinking about it and you asked
them and then like totally with you
Claire says Claire says I hate slippery
lipstick that smudges all over yet and
the bleeding into fine lines I'm
starting to get that alert I don't have
that really bad yet but I know it's
coming it's like on the way so I'm
hoping to be able to find some really
good lip liners along the way or lip
primers to help to avoid that just says
one lip product we've a film on your
lips
another thing is when I'm wearing a dark
lip and it fades unevenly and like I
have like regular lip color like right
here and then it's all like dark on the
outside and it just looks weird
it's like ombre on bag alright let's go
ahead and move on to let's do i shadow
eyeshadow what are some things I shot as
my favorite I feel like a good blend and
they just blend so effortlessly into
each other and then at the end of the
day and it still looks blended like they
have it money together there's still
that beautiful separation of color and
still looks like that perfect blend at
the end of the day like that is money
from me that is the thing right that
makes me so happy and I love bright
pigmentation I love like really bold
poppy pigmentation especially like
bright in the center of the lid that old
pop of color is so Debbie says Pat Von
D's the best not sure she's still
talking about lipstick or a shadow but I
would have I would agree that we the eye
shadow pigmentation is fabulous from Kat
Von D Felicia says pigmentation yes
Felicia Felicia yes Kylie says I don't
usually have an issue with bleeding so
lip liners only use from you to make
applying lipstick easier there you go
justice says Julius place amazing I
recently got a comment on when my julius
place videos that she had an allergic
reaction to GBAS place she was asking me
what I thought it was the only thing I
can think of that it might be because
their their ingredient list it's really
really small in Julia's place liquid
lipsticks in Greek was just so small so
I'm thinking that it might be the
pigment in it that she might be allergic
to because I would imagine through these
pastries is a higher concentration of
pigment then a lot of other eyeshadow
brings that's just a guess but I thought
that was kind of an interesting thing
that she had an allergic reaction to it
which is very sad
seriously it's totally amazing tan says
Jen I missed you thank you - I
appreciate that Tammy says I love
when they blend beautifully and last
forever the rock doesn't get enough
loved in my favorite LaRocca really is a
great play on my biggest complaint about
lorac is the amount of powder pick up
but they really do blend very nicely
they just take a little bit of practice
to not get fallout on your face to you
know not get makeup everywhere you're
just really gentle with that with that
product Lauren says I have to watch with
a mirrored face I try to wear it on
liquid lip days for easier checks I'm
not quite sure what that means I don't
know why I don't know if I'm being slow
or what oh I just missed a lot
oh no I miss a lot of thing Tiffany John
says shadows that make my lids look
wrinkled of more than they are
oh that's things that you don't like
yeah I hear yo definitely especially
with some metallic ones Breanna loves
Mitaka shadows yes Claire says I love
pigmented eyeshadows you don't get money
absolutely Johnny says I shine is my
favorite too pigmentation either blends
ability and staying power
Melissa Oh miss uh says just that the
lorac Desert Sun set yesterday aren't so
pretty I haven't dipped into those yet
I've got some requests for review but I
feel like I've got a lot that I want to
do right now so I don't want to buy any
new products right in this moment I had
some things gifted to me which were
really really nice so I'm playing with
some of those things and I got a pure
box from benefit for brows stuff that
I'm playing with I'm playing with some
stuff like that Clinique sent me so I
want to make use of that and get to know
those products before I buy anything
else so I'm kind of floating off into
the rock for a minute I also have the
subculture palette on the way but I'm
really excited to try I've seen some
mixed reviews today I watched Oh what's
her name they just totally went out of
my head ah now I have to look in my
history to find out what her name is but
but I just watched her review of the
subculture palette and she said that it
was a powdery math like she does she
tapped her brush in it and powder was
just going everywhere hold on a minute
let me look at my history cuz I've got
to know I can't remember Alyssa Ashley I
didn't have to look and yeah Alyssa
actually I don't just pop that in my
head
but anyway I watched her review bucket
and it was crazy and then supposedly I
got a comment recently about that today
about that that the modern Renaissance
and subculture pellet have different
formulas so I'm really interested to get
that and try that out but I'm not going
to under them you get them in the rock
ones I feel like I want to focus on one
and doing more with that and I have the
Jaclyn hill palette with you that I'm
still working on it's got so much in
there just take it in a while let's see
I love aviation Pat Landy shadows also
tart and Julia's place says Abby Lauren
says I have to oh the new your face
thing I didn't get that comment for some
reason
Snoopy wants to know if I've ever been
to the st. Ives mixing bar no I haven't
that was one of the stories and what's
it make-up and makeup today oh no it's
it's skip down okay yeah doc says Alyssa
had a tough time with subculture pot I
saw that and Tiffany said she hit pan
after one you see yes I saw that but she
was I mean to be fair she was going like
this as a demonstration of how much
powder was picking up so I mean she was
tapping in there quite a bit in order to
hit pan but that still should not have
done that
AJ said the bomb cream eye shadow sticks
so smooth so smooth in long-lasting plus
there are baseball-themed named yes this
does status fix I trouble with those
printing on you for some reason balm
shadows that especially if I try to
layer powder over top and on the lines
weird Erica said the jeffree star beauty
killer palette I hate to admit it but I
do really love that palette Kylie says
won't lie I was kinda disappointed by
the subculture palette selection I mean
two yellows yeah I'm gonna have to get
my hands along it to try it out
alright so what are some things we hate
about eyeshadow some things we ate and I
think the biggest thing that I hate
about eyeshadows is when they blend away
when you put it on and you think you've
got color and you put on another color
and they're weird the first coat ago I
don't even know and then you keep
blending it's like weird the second
caligula go I don't even know that's the
thing that those about our shadows when
they blend away I find that with a lot
of drugstore eyeshadows which makes me
really sad because I don't I don't get
like I feel like like companies like big
companies like Revlon L'Oreal like that
they
specifically I don't know maybe this is
just me in conspiracy theory and you
know not looking in reality and not
understanding but I almost feel like
that they like specifically make them
bad on for this not I'm not saying all
of them but some of them they make bad
on purpose so that you have good things
compared to with the more expensive
brands so you feel like you're getting
them like your money's worth when you
get the expensive one I don't know am i
off base they're like I feel like
there's got to be some kind of
conspiracy there because I know the
L'Oreal and Revlon not borealis much but
Revlon and covergirl like they've been
doing makeup forever there's no reason
why with the amount of money that they
have and the amount of experience they
have that they couldn't make a good
quality drugstore eyeshadow powder you
know what I mean like not L'Oreal I
should take L'Oreal because L'Oreal has
made some pretty nice eyeshadow palettes
I think L'Oreal for me is the strongest
drugstore brands out there as far as
consistency in good products alright
let's talk about some other things that
we hate lack of PUD pigmentation fallout
muddy and creasing yes that's what three
drops of sunshine said Marinella says I
hate it when I shadow goes all over my
eyes without me even knowing since I
can't see myself in the mirror and
sometimes it's smeared even more
embarrassing yes ginger says when it
transfers up to where I don't want I you
when it's supposed to be on the lid and
the crease and end up on the brow bone
yes and I find that a lot with clean
shadows at the Stila ones that I love
those transfer up on to like above my
crease sometimes Cheyenne Cheyenne says
oh no I lost Shan what happens um no it
skipped down there she is I hate when
shadows look chalky and patchy yes
Alexander says maybe people make excuse
for drugstore because it's less
expensive but I don't feel like that man
lot money
money more money than these indie brands
I really feel like that they wanted to
they could make really good quality drug
source stuff but they could if they
wanted I don't I think they're doing it
on purpose I do because I feel like they
need to like say well it's cheap
so of course it's got not gonna be as
good you know I don't know I don't know
I just thought that they really really
wanted to make me much better stuff for
that price point I do I don't know maybe
it's just my lack of understanding
I could totally be being very ignorant
right now but that's just the way I feel
in this moment in this time Christina
says when they money together when
you're trying to get that difference in
the fading color and they're just money
together yeah Amy says are dusty no
color don't stay that color yeah when
they change colors oh my gosh and fade
after 20 minutes the Smashbox are the
little mini palette I had such a hard
time getting them to stay the color that
they wore in the pan because as soon as
I blenders out just look black for prey
okay they had these weird gray and black
undertones especially in like the was it
the bold one news I guess it was the
smoky one which apportioning wants the
more smoky smoky spray but I don't want
the green turning ray and the purple
turning gray you know I want them to be
green I want the grapes make quick money
so I moved that to Italy with you Arkana
here okay sherry says I don't love that
something just disappear I have taught
from Alf that played that played a David
Copperfield within an hour just poof
gone knows especially when you really
like the look you came up with and then
the next thing you look it's like where
did it go all that work and it's already
gone three hours later what Trish says
I'm done with eyeshadow palette launch
madness done you know I feel like I
talked to privately big kimberly-clark
I guess it was a couple months ago and I
told her if she's ever in New York to
let me know because I want to hang out
with it but I feel like you know I've
had people tell me that what's it can
make up is like kimberly-clark
but the opposite because it makes you
want to buy everything but I totally
disagree I feel like what's up good
makeup my makeup news show if you don't
know is kind of like what she does in
that it shows you how much stuff is
coming out so that it helps you realize
you don't mean every single release
because there's so much coming out and
kind of helps you pick in the shoes what
you want I know
it can definitely encourage people like
when you see something that we didn't
already know about to encourage them to
go buy stuff but I think it also could
have the opposite effect too and I hope
that my that what's the makeup doesn't
induce too much consumerism because I
feel like you know a nice joining of
Kimberly Clark and me would be such a
beautiful thing I don't want to
encourage people to overspend but then
at the same time what's the makeup kind
of does that I guess to an extent but
then you know I think knowing about
everything makes you not want to buy as
much I don't know I'm talking these are
things but really hoping that it doesn't
really make people go over there while
the consumers I'm just keep it in
perspective that there's so much kind of
not you don't need everything let's see
Heidi says Judy's placed a my eyelids
cream you for six kiddies I would
believe that I believe that he's got to
get yourself a good eye makeup remover
girlfriend but you know oh I'm sorry
about that I can see that though it's
very very pigmented Kathleen says when
they're muddy or when the shadows are
powdery you're so right about Revlon I
agree oh no it skipped down again so
frustrating mary says generally quite
junk lab I would love that and we talked
about it I would really like to one day
though we just have to get in the same
place at the same time and I think it
would happen it's saying
sherry says I don't think it cause you
don't want to spend that's good the
enemy says I'm still mad at the color
drain and probably not by the community
arts palette yeah and I think the whole
limited release thing I think makes
people really upset especially with
eyeshadow palettes when they say
something's to be limited-edition and
then it comes back comes as not live in
addition it comes as permanent I feel
like with the color rain I don't know if
they intend I think that they probably
did intend it to be my kids are out
there young and don't know why hopefully
can't hear them but I don't know if they
intended it to be to come back us as a
full you know permanent item I do feel
like that some bigger brands do do that
where like for example morphe
I was watching something the other day
and they're talking about the very
limited
of the 25 pan pallets and they're still
around I think that was last Christmas
they were supposed to be a very limited
release of the 25 PM collets but they're
still around
i-i-i don't know i mean i don't know for
sure but i have a gut feeling that's all
i can say i've got feeling that they
never intended is to be limited edition
it's just the way that they continue to
exist and their worldly wasn't didn't
seem to be a break and when they went
from limited edition of permit you know
like they didn't know that people were
going to like them no I don't know I
kind of give Julia's place country these
plates coded written a little bit more
of a break than working for some reason
I guess because they took so long to
bring it back to full stop and they are
a smaller brand you know I don't know
yeah color grain Queen of Hearts is is
one be permanent as a fall and I love
that palette it's amazing it is on
presale I definitely recommend it those
cards are calling - I definitely
recommend it Amy says what's your
favorite high-end shadow primer I think
I need one and not even that drives my
lids out have you tried the Kat Von D
one
that one's a pretty good one if you like
the muting out of discoloration I I
would say try Kat Von D stick that would
be smokin favorite mixed to even or you
don't want to get the older one because
the older one is very similar in formula
to evenings you don't get that one
bancini says Moochie face and Kat Von D
collab was supposed to be very little
sedition and you can still get it that's
right and that's that's annoying to me I
don't like that okay so now we've talked
a little bit of eye shadow I feel like
another one we can talk a lot about is
mascara
I feel like mascara is another one that
I have such a love-hate relationship
with I think my biggest cut oh wait no
things I love about B I think we already
talked about things we think you ever
did okay just make sure we did
everything
thank you no mascara things that I love
about mascara is when I bet that
voluminous like I think everybody all we
want in mascara is length and volume I
think those need to things like as far
as the actual performance of it then we
don't want it to flake and we don't want
it to smudge but I feel like those are
the things
vol you're flicking your smudging except
for those people that have those
naturally long lashes we're and like if
they wear glasses they don't really want
a lot of length because then hits their
glasses that's never gonna mean Erica
says lash paradise I'm really enjoying
my lash paradise I'm really enjoying my
essence mascaras to the lash princess my
essence is amazing I feel like I
honestly feel in my heart and soul and
I've said this multiple times before
that you never need to buy a high-end
that's Tara I have never met a high-end
mascara that over performs my drugstore
that's there is never I found some that
are the same that are just as good but I
cannot justify a twenty dollar price tag
on a mascara when drugstore mascaras are
so stinking good let's see it let me go
down okay no flakes yes I love my
essence lash princess mascara Briana
says ty ku says either
it won't stay or it won't go yes when
it's hard to remove oh my gosh when you
thought you're ripping every eyelash out
of your eyes trying to remove it or
you're giving yourself a million
wrinkles like just by trying to rub the
mascara off oh my gosh that's the worst
I hate it sometimes I'll be honest with
you if I get me situation for my mascara
and you I'll just leave it on I'll just
go to bed with the mascara on that's
left and I'll just let it be because I'd
rather just let it be on my eyes then
rub and tug my lashes or just let it be
I'll try again in the morning
cuz I don't know I also have sat there
and put whale on my lids like oily
makeup remover like I make a mirror on
my lid and then just let it sit there
for five minutes trying to get it to
break up the product because I am with
you on that one
Jenna doesn't like the lash paradise oh
that's interesting
Alana at makeup girl rock says I love
what mascara actually stays on my lashes
Faiza says what my lashes look so good
people ask me if I'm wearing falsies
yeah that doesn't happen to me ever
because my natural lashes are so short
that I can never get a mascara to really
truly make them look fake except for I'm
gonna be very honest with you the unique
mascara actually I've had people ask me
if my lashes are fake but I've one eye I
will tell you that as much as I am NOT a
fan of unique products they changed
supposedly if you try to eat right
before January of this past year it was
a completely different formula that was
terrible and every formulated it in
January I feel like that one has
probably the closest to actually
creating a false lash look for me and I
hate to say that it hurts my soul to say
that to be honest with you but really
and truly I feel like that one has done
well by me I don't think that it's worth
the price though because I feel like now
that use it a lot I mean it's only only
lasts for three months and I feel like
the fibers are getting into the mascara
and compromising the product so even
though it can give me that false lash
look I still recommend that like you
invest in it if you don't have that
extra money to glow if that's the only
mascara you're gonna get like I still
don't I don't think that that's good
because doesn't last long enough for me
like I can't even use it anymore because
the fibers have gotten so deep into the
mascara but I'm just honest like I can't
I can't not be honest so I hate saying
it but Heidi says she's been loving a
l'oreal lash paradise in the lancome we
all share big very good I haven't tried
the Lancome we're sure big Cindy says
and used to like the superhero but I'm
not enjoying it anymore get so pumped on
me yeah superhero I first saw that on
someone when I went to IMAX and I met
Christine game and Kristen was wearing
superhero mascara by it cosmetics and I
was like oh my gosh that looks amazing
that looks so good on her she's like
yeah the brand new it cosmetics super
here I was like that it's awesome you
get my hands on it but it did not
perform for me
the way it seemed to perform for her it
gave him some length but didn't give me
volume and it was just okay for me
unfortunately FISA says else mineral
mascara is also really good for my hair
really nice Stacy says lash paradise
close them all way for her lisa says to
face melt off works well to remove
mascara that's good to know I didn't
have to face melt off but I didn't find
from me for the mascara I was using it
with I didn't find it to be any better
than like my Clinique took the day off
the the remover Beltway Li will deliver
stuff I personally prefer that I feel
like it's easier faster I think with the
with the Too Faced it just takes too
long to deal with to get it to work
masochists says Rimmel scandaleyes retro
glam is from your fave nice and twitch
says I'm hooked on roller lash Jenny
says I hate it when I have a trial size
mascara and I love it when I buy the
full size and it's a goopy mess and
doesn't work the same what up I don't
know and you are not the first person to
say that that I've heard about the
sample size being different from the
full size I personally have never had
that because I very rarely will buy a
full size that I've tried as a sample
because I feel like as a reviewer I
don't need to once I've tried it and
last time absolutely in love with it I
don't need to purchase it and like I
said because I love my drugstore
mascaras so much that I've repurchase
drugstore mascaras but I think I don't
think I've ever read for just a high-end
mascara Meredith says NYX doll eyes
different playable lengths awesome Belen
bugging Belen Rodriguez says Tarte and
turns to me her eyes itchy and watery
well that's the worst I've heard a lot
of people having issues with itchy
watery eyes with mascaras before if
you've ever had that experience I would
love to know what masters do that for
you because that way you can warn people
also that have sensitive eyes because
we're all working together in the
collective brain of makeup bosses to
help each other do not have the area
alright let's go ahead and move on let's
talk about I don't know we should talk
about next we could talk about for gosh
we could talk about how later we could
talk about idol I know there's so many
different things
Kimmy says what drugstore mascaras are
my favorite while waiting for people to
come on that favorite ones are essence
last princess Jordana best lash extreme
those are probably my favorite favorite
favorites those ending of any the
L'Oreal the Rory album is original and
the l'oreal lash curler eyes are also
very nice I also like them the way out
butterfly L'Oreal makes nice nice Tara's
talking about powder products okay liner
blush highlighter I feel like with
powder products we saw like I feel like
I'm not a great question to talk about
how to products leave it you guys talk
about powder products because I don't
have people only up to very dry skin a
lot of powder products we're very well
for me so it's one that I personally
have trouble talking about I just saw
Nicole for the yay or nay Nicole I can't
believe you're here what is it like six
o'clock in the morning in in San
Francisco oh my gosh
and your gem duty this weekend what is
going on oh my gosh she wanted to talk
about your laughing Oh foundation that's
a good one we haven't talked about
anything close the foundation yeah let's
talk about foundation we still can talk
about a few more topics so we foundation
what I love about foundation is when for
me I like a nice medium coverage I like
when I can still see my freckles through
it but my skin tone is is overall even
where you know you can tell that I'm
wearing something to even my tone but
it's not so perfect that it looks like a
fabulous you know what I mean I feel
like a lot of beauty influencers on
YouTube to have that perfect candidacy
foundation on and I don't prefer that
for me personally I think it looks
beautiful for Instagram it is beautiful
for YouTube but when I see people in
person that have that very flat
foundation look I personally
enjoy that on people that's just my
preference but you do you
girlfriend-boyfriend you do the to love
but that's just not my thing but anyway
I like that and I love a long wearing
foundation I feel like that potential
for me that makes me a foundation is
what I feel like I still have the same
look on at the end of the day or at
least close to it as I did at the
beginning Michelle says full coverage
but not picky Thank You Michelle and
thank you for all you do for the
Facebook group and what's a good makeup
I appreciate you so much Jane says Jesus
I'm still trying to find a foundation
take some more strategy that could plug
in my dark spots from acne and have acne
yeah yeah I had a my my friend Wendy
that Bobby's best friends with in
college we don't communicate anymore
but she was in love with the benefit
erase paste that was her things public
for acne scarring so that would
definitely be something I would
recommend to you to try out underneath
your foundation Tiffany says if you
haven't tried it you may have already
tried it
Tiffany says I love by the way to me
John has a very good of you to channel
you should watch it I love good coverage
not too thick love Too Faced Born This
Way not so much fat onesies
yeah I tried to cut by the the locket
Foundation I wasn't as big of a fan of
it and I ended up returning it I mean I
ever talk about it
I do love Too Faced Born This Way that's
probably one of my favorite toothpaste
products of all time if you're going
this way I do like the way it looks at
me doesn't make you look for in this way
for me I feel like it's a little bit
more full coverage but you can
definitely tell you how can you come on
but I do really like the coverage
especially for filming I very much enjoy
that want to use that one for filming
Sarah says foundations that emphasize my
pores no matter how much I bucket in
that's my deal breaker yes family said
she liked the bare minerals foundation
there's a few there Mouse foundations I
had to see Ron Foundation from Bama
knows that was really good until I got
old and then it got worse and stuff then
I like to be there the nose powder
foundation
I'm trying to thank the bareMinerals I
don't have tried to bareMinerals liquid
foundation but I do like the powder
foundation I like it as a topper overtop
of liquid foundation to kind of beef up
the coverage a bit I like their than
those overall as a brand I don't think
they get enough love
I think they've been around for a while
and people like don't see them as being
as twenty other brands but they do make
some really good stuff oh my gosh would
just skip down again Black Diamond
opponent wants to know should I try
double mirror or board this way my
personal preference is born this way
just because it's not quite as their
coverage a double wear but if you want
something more full coverage I would say
double up Valerie says I don't think
flawless foundations this I've yet to
find one I think that flawless
foundation is the same thing as looking
like a mannequin for me I've seen it
with the Mac foundation where I feel
like every single flaw is covered but at
the same time that to me that looks very
unnatural
I think flaws can make your face look so
beautiful in that it makes your the girl
person where I feel that everything is
covered off you just don't look real no
that's just my opinion
so I you know that way I don't know if
you revlon colorstay for dry skin is
really as favorite pink coordinate says
my favorite is the original sugar that
Chanel but it in the air I've heard such
good things about Chanel foundations I
have not picked the bullet to buy one
but I've heard wonderful things what do
you and II just say I lost Danny L'Oreal
truly me is amazing I've heard great
things about morality to which I have
never tried why have I never tried it
they're young and he says I found Estee
Lauder Double Wear too sticky embalming
and it's on me it definitely has a
little bit of that healthy feel to it
that's very true TV says I can't wear a
full coverage foundation because of my
under eye wrinkles yes when it like
picks up under your under eyes it's
starting to get worse from you when I
first time making YouTube videos I feel
like I didn't have enough spine lines
under my eyes so they see a lot of under
I like creasing and things but now I
a little more so I'm starting to see
that more Lucas says long wear my makeup
lasts until lunch and then I work walk
on my lunch break
when I get back to work I had streaks on
my forehead kv-1 in my shiny nose I feel
like I need help yeah I think that like
sweat is the enemy and oil is the enemy
you're welcome to nah I think sweaty the
enemy in oil is the enemy of a lot of
foundations I think it's just finding
one because I think foundation for these
things it's very very personal I think
it's just about finding one that matches
well with your skin pH and your skin
balance you know what I mean like
because I think you know no matter what
anybody says about any foundation I
think you really have to try it on
yourself and that's why I love if you
have a support you know you think you
can go in and get samples in the
foundation before you buy it I think
that that's wonderful because I really
do feel like you need to try it on
yourself in order to really know what
it's like all right Jamie says on like
medium to full coverage uneven skin tone
on my forehead okay so let's talk a
little bit about things that we what we
don't like about foundation that by the
way is looking for a foundation for oily
acne prone skin if you have suggestions
for her please leave them in the
comments down below so that makes you
come back and check
so things we hate about foundations for
me my big thing with foundations that I
hate is oxidation when I feel like at
the dawn it looks beautiful and then
three hours later I have in that face
you guys mean that face when you're
facing in that Couture different colors
I absolutely make that it's like they
believe what just happened to me and now
I look like a new believer that's that's
pretty terrible I can't stand it
Jenna says devil where has it oxidized
oddly nice deep clean sighs I cannot
find anything you want please I'm gonna
under eyes a baked I don't think on
shakes a press and then how the pictures
and I still have a problem Oh Holly says
crazy eyes
sinking into fours yes Monique says
foundations they don't include women of
color all colors yes and
really liked if you wanted some
Stephanie to pull this video on was it
it was like I think it's like a bomb
makeup video pretty sure it was I think
she pulled it like a bomb makeup it was
called but it was pretty recent and I
know it has Bob black on maybe beauty
brand in the title and she was talking
about why brands don't carry foundations
in all of the colors and they were
talking about just money-wise you know
how much it costs she can blow she was
talking about you know how much it cost
to utility rent the shelf space you know
and how much shelf space you have and
you have to fill it with what's going to
sell the most and what's gonna sell the
most where the shades that are in the
middle the shades on either end aren't
going to sell as much so they invest in
the middle instead of the very light and
the very heat and that's why a lot of
times you can't find the very lighter
the very deep you have to go online to
buy it if they make it at all so what I
thought that was very interesting that
she said Jenna says breaking up is
nasty-looking yes when money when you
look at your face and you see like then
it's all broken up oh gosh that's the
worst I keep that yes AJ bomb is black
code maker brands I just can't remember
what exactly she titled it I should know
it has bomb in the title John folda Jen
fold I hate when I look good in the
morning go to the bathroom two hours
later and have to play where in the
world am i foundation go where didn't
know well did my foundation said sing to
Carmen Sandiego did it I think I handled
it
Jamie says I can't find I find if they
carry more shades they are only
available online the lightest
wet-and-wild photo focus makes me look
yellow the one they carry in store yeah
mmm-hmm let's see I've just got the
hourglass skip missus says she's excited
to try it
Amy says but it looks dry and cakey yes
Kathleen says the oil from my t-zone
ensures through it doesn't matter the
coverage formula if I powder so
oftentimes I'll go with it I teach so I
don't usually find the time to touch-up
yes oh my gosh girlfriend going to the
bathroom
finding time to go to the bathroom the
inner teacher like that is the problem
but
like touching up your makeup forget it I
wouldn't have learned a lot about really
spin from Tassie from v as that shoes is
the blotting papers a lot that's
something that's born to me because I
have never had to use that thank
goodness I've never had to feel like I'm
even that it's a product that can skip
but maybe even just keeping those and
your first reverse when you go to the
bathroom you can just confident thank
bomb I don't know if you've tried that
or not you probably have Lisa says I
always blend my foundation down my neck
yes uh-huh
definitely but I can still look like I
went especially like if I blend down my
neck and I matched my skin so I didn't
notice it and then the next thing I know
I've got like patch me like orange like
it did Pedro because it did match my
skin at one point body Pickers do help
actually said ELISA says that anyone
should get to try new colors of been
wanting to in one foundation thoughts
across party girls I did not have a good
experience with the Milani two-in-one
foundation they color matched me a
generation me and I still did not have
an experience with it it still was not
the right color and oxidized it was not
good for me yes Annie you can link the
stephanie nicole video absolutely you

put it in on later on they put it in the
in the comments or in the video
description later thanks for trying to
appreciate it yeah definitely Monique I
will definitely link that video the 74
video all right so anyway let's move on
to
why don't do cheap products and down so
like blush contour highlight things that
make me love cheek products the biggest
thing for me is lasting power
I feel like lasting power is essential
like when I put I feel cheap products
last the worst on me they are the ones
that fade the fastest they are the ones
that I don't see later on in the day and
I don't know why that's what it is
III don't know why they're the ones that
fade so when I find a cheap product that
lasts a really long time on me I like
reach on to it like the bones in stain
blushes in love with those let's see
what else do I really love i love the
anastacio contour kit for lasting power
for contour for highlights the earth the
highlights last a mini long time on me
so that's kind of my like love
highlights unbid from space girl for
highlights I'm actually wearing more
than youth Becca highlighters on my
cheeks today I actually topped it onto
my weight as well because I was like
loving him so I forget which one it is
I should go book without knocking my
coffee so I'm really enjoying this this
is the Becca light chaser highlighter
for face and eyes is this opal flashes
Jade that's what I have on my cheeks I'm
really loving this I don't recommend the
lip products but I really like the
highlight I like the front face holla
later I know a lot of people don't but I
thought for contour I just I just have
to find the right shade when I find the
right shade I would eat on to it and I
go crazy on it Shani says black Becca's
opal stays on really well on her rachel
says highlighter is for weakness Erica
says elf liquid blush is long lasting
but you have to work quickly with it
good to know thank you so much for that
black diamonds and Phil says I love
depend upon contour palette oh my gosh
me too if you can get your hands on the
continent blonde contour palette booked
too
I've seen it on sale here in there that
one is really really good I love the
eyeshadows they're all wonderful along
with the contour powders and
fathers I like Padres are more subtle in
there but but there are really really
good quality sobrino the makeup mom
definitely check out her YouTube channel
as well I love a peach color blush I
don't care much for a highlight all I
don't care much for highlight she uses
it just a little bit but she forgot
actually but that's it's not a big deal
yeah and there was a time when I was
like what is the most useless kind of
product that you own highlighter like
I'll be always like highlighters who
misuse this product I own I very rarely
use it I think it's a dumb product
you're never gonna get paid on open it
ever you'll ever use one thing I like
girlfriend if you saw how many
highlighters or flip them if you saw how
many collimators I have in my doing
right now it's it's like me nauseating
how many highlighters I have because I
am showing it to the highlighters right
now because they've been so on trend
I've like wanted to try them all and
it's stupid
it's so stupid in such consumerism it
really is but it's a different shade of
champagne this one's a lighter shade and
this one's got a beautiful fish in it so
you scroll down a bit clipping loves em
you loving the Natasha Jimena higher
there's so much Aspen says I love the
good matte bronzer in a matte brush with
a gloomy Hall like you need to
absolutely don't we wants to know what
my favorite insane shade is probably
pinstripe they love pinstripe how do I
know that off the top of my head I do
love pin straight Jamie owns one
highlighter you're good
you're solid we don't need any more
don't get into consumerism like I had
Nicole says I never knew never highlight
my life I yes we're in the same boat
there Jenna says I have a lot deep-clean
says Patrice makes onto a highlight
compact and the contour in it it's
absolutely outstanding great to know I
really want to get some more Catrice
I've been really getting into essence
but I want to get more Patrice I don't
own enough of them
Shauna says anyone ever put on the
highlight I know I have it
Lauren Alice says I need to head out eat
breakfast okay
thank you for being here I appreciate
you Linda says the charges per blow and
I lost that liquid highlighter is a
stunner it's beautiful use your finger
not a sponge to put it on and tap don't
rub I put my translucent powder at the
top at last I came out nice I only done
a whole lot of the layering the pilot
why don't you mention a liquid highlight
like a lot of people have seen recently
doing the powder and then with the
liquid on top or the liquid with the
powder on top it's mostly the liquid
with the powder on top and just to give
you that extra bling I don't find a you
know with that just because I feel like
a lot of the cutters that I have already
have a lot of glow and I feel like the
liquids they mount they put some nice
things to my skin I feel like the
layering of it makes it not blend as
well into my skin if that makes sense so
it looks more layed on rather than as
part of my skin hopefully I'm
articulating that well
Yara says I'm not a highlighter fan and
I feel like highlighters especially the
really gloomy ones can really accentuate
pores so things we don't like about
highlighters do we have five minutes
left
highlighters highlighters blushes
contour things we don't like let's talk
about those you know I feel like the
accentuation of pores for highlighters
is a huge huge thing I thankfully right
now I don't have very big pores I can
see them starting to get a little bit
bigger your buddy here so I would
imagine that's going to be more of a
problem for me as I get a bit older but
for now I'm doing okay but I feel like
that is a big big deal Julie says but in
law highlighters are good too
that is awesome I have one wet and wild
high later and it's good it's not my
favorite but it's definitely good I also
really liked the essent eyelid I feel
like the essence highlighter and the wet
loud are kind of on the same level of
Awesomeness
I think the wet Mod one is a little bit
more poppy than the essence the nude one
but I feel like the quality is equally
as powdery like I don't feel like it
melds into the skin as much as me more
am I more expensive highlighters but I
do really like them Jamie says
highlighters and oversized eyeshadow use
eyeshadows the highlights of
and that's really smart very smart Jenny
I completely agree Kylie says she does
knowledge during a boring browsers they
don't work coming either I know that
they can work for some people but they
do not work for me
nicole says at 50 I'm very careful with
highlight placement I am super
girlfriend you know what I hate is when
I accidentally when I accidentally get
my highlighter under my eyes a little
bit oh I've definitely done that before
bancini says I don't use contour you
might they have over that I think at
this point contour is the one thing that
I really don't do every day I think I do
it before what I film but if I'm not
filming I don't take a good contour oh
it says if you make over your cheeks
then dust away highlighter doesn't show
up or is it much great step caller thank
you Sasa says generally heard or tried a
new stain that Maxie Roger from Rimmel I
just saw it in the drugstore two days
ago I have not seen that I have been in
Iceland for the past week with my family
so I am very much out of the makeup
booth and have not seen that
unfortunately but I'm getting back into
makeup loops so hopefully I will see it
soon I said I love highlight but I hate
glittery ones nope no piece of glitter
on my face especially when it ends up
everywhere yes oh my gosh when glitter
starts migrating away from where we put
it like especially glitter of lips when
I feel like glitter lips and the right
time it looks but when it starts going
everywhere like oh whoa but yeah
highlight when it when you put on
glitter when you put on your eyes and it
falls like down under your eyes like I
don't want the other keep and that's not
my style
that's not something I enjoy or and I
don't want glitter down here like I want

Sabrina says glitter is my nemesis
Christina says maybe I'm strange but I
take further altogether you're totally
not strange I was at the box of Tron
video that I did where we talked about
the angel what is it orange Couture
highlighter it's more of like a kind of
a topper almost it's mostly just at the
glitter I didn't enjoy that just because
it's a little too much for me I'd rather
of shimmery than the glitter for my
cheeks that's just me personally as it
says KBS sometimes contours my brush and
I skip contour so you are a great thing
didn't have a turn for it when you do
blush as a contour series those champion
champagne truffle the original chocolate
bar worked well for a pilot yes it does
it's got that pink shift it's very
pretty face it says that's cool - cool
tone can't work on becoming a quad one

check out medium if you were my skin
tone the technical arm length is
wonderful the one in the Anasazi contour
kit is very good also the one in the Von
D shade + light contour is very very
good but definitely for cool tones also
I'm the desert like clearly places but
the Burberry one is also very nice food
tongue I got a sample of that when I got
a small one I got like a little Burberry
it was like $30 or something for them

did a mini lipstick but yeah I really
like those so I'm sorry that they're not
that they're approached stupidly price

doesn't matter - I don't know I love
