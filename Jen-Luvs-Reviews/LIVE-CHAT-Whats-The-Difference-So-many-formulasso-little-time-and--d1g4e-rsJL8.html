your head just want to explode with all
of the different choices that there are
everywhere it's a for the drugstore

choices like how do you even pick what
kind of thing you needs that's what can

and scroll all the way up to the top as
high as I can go say hello to the first

up in makeup you can search for what's
good makeup or you can search for jenn
louis reviews on the ios app store or on
google play whatever that is the iOS got
the android version you should be able
to look for it somewhere in one of those
let's see so first time for Ruth
jessica's here she says I'm waiting for
you with my 7 month old Louis hi Luis um
Lewis he's 7 months old i knows i was
talking to one he's 7 and says seven
months so good to have you here both
Jessica and Louis hello to Cheyenne
Marcy Tabitha's in the house Molly's
here Katerina's here and grace and Nina
and Catherine downing check out our
YouTube channel Jenny sue is here kids
here Melanie and I'm gonna get everybody
lots of people Grady's here was so great
and Nellie is here all right I'm going
to scroll all the way down if I did not
say hello to you I'm saying hello to you
now hello and welcome to the world so go
Meera go to so let's go ahead and jump
into the stove that I've got on my table
here it's also is it a shell a shells
first time you're fantastic Nellie wants
torito's all not any Doritos makeup
hasn't gotten to that point yet you can
use torito's probably as like maybe some
kind of lip product or cheap product if
you really wanted to be adventurous but
it might be a little chunky all right
let's start with primer face primers so
face primers I've got three different
things
for you first thing I've got is tinted
moisturizer um tinted moisturizer I feel
like was the first kind of face primer
that I discovered adds a little bit of
color to your face time keeping up evens
out your skin tone a little bit before
you put on foundation so tinted
moisturizers um Kim be a nice base for a
less coverage foundation or even a more
coverage foundation the one that I
really like is to Josie Maran daily
argan argan daily moisturizer protecting
perfect it's got a lot of hydration
though so if you have oily skin you may
not like this one I really like fun i
also don't know if they make lots of
skin tones it's very close to my skin
tone so if you're not my skin tone this
may not work for you but definitely get
a sample at sephora if you have to be
blown by sephora try this one out and
see if you like it so tinted moisturizer
is one kind then we got silicon-based
primers and not silicone case primers or
water-based primer so let me just make
sure that I'm speaking group in both
those over to Drew levario this is a
silicon-based however this is the
Smashbox photo finish pore minimizing
now this is the drama with pore
minimizing primers Oh Chrissy says Josie
Maran is her a ride or die and she's got
dry skin fantastic this is the thing
about pore minimizing primers especially
ones like this this can be somebody's
holy grail this can be amazing for some
people for killing in their pores
awesome amazing foundation goes over
beautifully feels for you on the skin
amazingness other people say that it
clogged pores and that it's not good
because it feels it's it messes with
your skin for me personally with my
normal skin Cheryl's asking which do i
prefer honestly because I have normal
skin I can go with any of them I feel
very very fortunate I did nothing to
deserve this I did not earn this but I
can pretty much use anything I just kind
of go with whatever I feel like doing
that day um I honestly know like if I
really had to pick a man to make me pick
I would pick the tinted moisturizers I
just like the way they feel you want
another hydrating kind of thing this is
a water-based primer and this is the
bare minerals prime time it really feels
like water when it goes on the skin it
feels very moisturizing hydrating but it
doesn't have that pore filling effect so
if you want pore filling try this out
see if you like it hopefully it doesn't
call grid force though
that's the that's the give and take of
these kinds of things I'm Catherine says
the benefit professional lovett rider
die for combo to dry at times is what
she uses krista says I need a good
primer for winter I've only used the
back of Becca backlit but I don't want
globally skin during the fall winter so
it really is just what what you
gravitate toward as far as whether you
like a silicone based primer or
water-based primer but these are ones
that I like that are these specific
forms these are kind of my favorites
I've got so much on this table I want to
just check with the collective brain and
see if I missed anything Nellie says the
bare minerals one is good but it called
see you're saying this one clogged pores
as well see I've never heard that about
this that's very interesting le thank
you for sharing that jessica says
benefits professional on my pores and
Rimmel stay matte in my p's own is the
trick for me and Becca says if you have
problems with your moisturizers not
marrying well with your primers try
spritzing some water on your face before
you apply your primer excellent tip
Becca thank you so much for that and
Krista said she heard the Make Up For
Ever ones are really good and psycho
pixie says the Knicks hydrating and
Nick's poor fillers are amazing and
super cheap Heidi says she liked the
Smashbox with the Urban Decay poor
perfecting primer is her ride or die
ride or die as like blown up everywhere
at people said rider died before but now
that that ride-or-die tag is now it's
like everybody's all fried or die I mean
just fun to say ride or die I like I'm
wondering what the opposite of that
would be though like the worst products
what would you call them like fall or
live like oh you know but anyway that's
off topic anyway recommendations for
oily skin a lot of people who like oily
skin from it from what I ever attended
like the water-based found on primers
because they don't tend to clog pores
and they're hydrating but not so
hydrating that it creates more oil
that's what I've heard I really know
sahaja I would love to do with the rider
die tag I have a list of a stupid amount
of videos that I want to do so next
we're definitely doing
this this needs to happen next week I
need to review this and then I have a
tree out I got a tree a system that I
need to review next week because it's
due next week they sent me the trai for
review so I do want to do the rider
diets on my list it's all my listening
to do I wanted to do it this week it
just depends on how many days I can film
all right move it on to could actually
note we were going to do on I primers so
I primer is for me I don't we really see
two different types of eye primers those
that mute out discoloration and those
that don't the Urban Decay primer potion
czar famous for being pretty amazing and
I think they're pretty amazing they are
doable I think for me personally I think
they're deeper bowl or at least i'm
pretty sure they're viewable but it's
it's really weathered y mu dot
discoloration or not so the Urban Decay
regular primer potion a nice Duke for
this is the the one by Coastal Scents is
actually a pretty close dupe for this
and then the urban decay in Eden is my
favorite but I was looking if you saw my
video that would live today on what's in
my face that'd be the ultimate one has
very similar ingredients to this one so
if the Ulta brand one is just as good at
this one you know I'm not going by an
urban decay anymore I must spend an
extra ten dollars for this that'd be
crazy so yes very excited about this
Cassie from thrift leg is here hi Cassie
good to see you here yay so with primer
though one thing I want to let you know
is one thing I actually have learns from
Wayne Goss and I found to be very very
true is when you're putting eyeshadow
primer as you want to put the littlest
amount possible in order to to get it
all over your lid because if you put on
too much you can actually go opposite
and make your eyeshadows crease and cake
and terribleness so you definitely don't
want to do that so that's kind of what
I'm seeing for eyeshadow primer or
anybody else won't say anything but I
shadow primer before we move on
everybody say hi to Cassie Cassie and I
had been girls for a long time it's good
to see you here sweetheart she said just
put it on put you up on my big screen
while I get some packing done nice off
the chat later about where your butcher
packing for what you do
Sheila says she loves the Urban Decay
anti-aging primer yes it's amazing isn't
it Sheila Krishna says i just used
concealer is an eye primer anyone else
see I've heard that that's really good
especially if you don't have much many
fine lines on your eyes I've heard that
concealer tends to break down a little
more as you get older and you start
having more fine lines and wrinkles and
your eyelids artist taught so I've heard
that it's not as good to use concealer
but when you're younger seems to be
pretty good that's what I've heard I
could be wrong but that's what I've
heard so blooming pancakes is here was
okay Kate um let's say Nick shadow base
is great adeline says carolyn says
painterly is probably one my favorites
um Mac's painterly is super fab Oh
Cassie's moving this week about replaced
a congratulations that's so exciting I'm
not supplies girlfriend you're go
getting zero go-getter alright we're
going to move on we're going to go on to
concealer okay three different types of
concealer we're really it's only two
types of concealer these two are pretty
much the same in my eyes we have like a
to be kind of concealer and then we've
got a pot concealer but really for me
they're relatively the same as far as
formula application all of that I feel
like some concealers blend better with a
brush some blend better with fingers but
it really doesn't seem to be whether
it's in a tube or a pot that makes a
difference it's just the individual
formula that's my opinion these are two
that I really really liked a lot the
knicks dark circle concealer super fab
and then the bye bye under eye but it
cosmetics now I've heard people say that
the it cosmetics one does crease and
fine lines should be careful of that
another one I really really like is a
bare minerals concealer I was obsessed
with this for the longest time but I'm
running out of it and I'm like holding
on to my last bits of pattern yeah this
is in summer best super super fab I was
surprised at how much this would conceal
again be careful with caking under the
eyes especially if you have oily skin
you may not like a powder because it
might take up in the oils and kind of
get in there and get all world so just
be careful of that but concealers that's
kind of the different formulas and
what's going on with them
um you know I can't really think of
anything else anything else anything
everybody's talking about the shape tape
like tart everybody's talking about I
don't know if I'm gonna get do not
outside yet cuz I've so many things I
want to review right now I'm getting a
little overwhelmed so I need to go
through the things that I've already
bought and then maybe get something else
Oh Chris he's talking about the bye-bye
redness my friend Laura over at mrs.
little lynn loves that stuff catherine
says I like the Knicks but get me is the
her ride or die Emma says the cabinet
Kwan sensual skin enhancer changed her
life it's super high coverage and thick
but it blends so beautiful ish says acne
and rosacea and it's good for her um
let's see Cassie says I feel like
concealers in the pot or a bit heavier
and thicker and in the tube they're a
bit more liquidy coverage is usually
good either way the Urban Decay Naked
concealer is worth all of the hug though
yeah and I would agree with you I think
so I mean if I think it just kind of
depends on the on what's in the two but
whether it's thicker than this but they
can be running or you're absolutely
right Cassie absolutely right um let's
see what anyway um Ilana says Rimmel
perfect match Ramon match perfect
lightweight and decent coverage alright
so let's go ahead and go on to the next
one cuz we're 15 minutes in I so much on
this table I want to share with you
let's move on to browse now browse I
feel like the different formulas of brow
products make a huge difference in how
they apply so three major types of brow
products you've got counters you got
pencils and you got gel pot dip brow ish
creamy stuff okay Nellie says the naked
concealer oxidizes on her very
interesting Chrissy says the Urban Decay
Naked concealer is awesome she returned
the shape tape it was too heavy like
full coverage foundation thick that's
good to know ok back to this all right I
feel like if you want instagram browse
you want to go for like you want really
define browse the best way to get it
easily and quickly is the Anasazi
dipbrow the brow by benefit these are
kind of the ones where you can really
outline really get that defined shape
really really thick like paint fully it
through if you don't have a lot of
eyebrows this
may be a good option for you if you
don't have a lot of brow or if you've
got spaces to fill in things like that
these are good kind of in the middle for
that I would say our pencils pencils you
can really draw and define but you're
not going to get as thick of an
application so you can kind of draw
hairs almost you know you take your
pencil and you literally draw hairs in
where you want hairs I mean you don't
want it to be like like you know
straight lines but kind of you know like
what kind of wisp it out a little bit
you know kind of color it in a little
bit like that hey not like we don't want
to look like a doll you know but but I
feel like this is this is kind of in the
middle as far as being able to fill
things in making it look like real hair
I feel like this is more this is my
favorite one this is the the loreal brow
stylist definer really really good i'm
karina stalking by the NYX micro pencil
I did have that but it was the wrong
color for me so I ended up kind of like
mmm on that one but it was just because
of the color it wasn't because of the
formal it was very nice this is very
similar to the Anasazi of railways which
is also an amazing product really really
good for powders and this is this is the
powder that I love the best this is by
body ography so amazing really really
good um I feel like with powders I think
it's the hardest to fill in the spaces
with powders if you don't have browse I
probably personally wouldn't recommend a
powder over the pencil or the the gel
just because I feel like it's harder to
work with to actually create a brow and
it's just it's just more difficult where
I feel like it's easier to really draw
with these where this is more of like a
fill-in kind of product it's not to say
that this isn't possible to use this to
kind of create a brow but I feel like
this is more fulfilling than for confirm
making an actual brow pancakes as
powders don't stay as well either
because there's nothing for them to
attach to there's nothing if you have no
brows there's nothing for them to attach
to with a power so if you're assuming a
little bit of fill in powder might be
the way
want to go and then more intense going
toward the pencil and gel feeling good
anybody else want to say anything that
Browns before we go on Grady says I'm so
hopeless at browsed ginger hair makes it
so hard to find a good color match that
doesn't look absurd on me I've heard
that the Anasazi has a really good
reddish tone pencil carolyn says the
brow do our brows sellers pretty good
and a shelf says I feel like powders
give me a softer look and I would
imagine that that would be true Chrissy
says I don't use the oh she's talking to
a massage some sahaja she says I've been
with an associate Anasazi dipbrow for
years oh I lost it I'm Catherine says
powder with a brow mascara over that's
another option absolutely Scarlett says
wet and wound has good brow powders and
jessica says I really hate doing my
brows oh well I mean you're Brad will
shave your face if you've never done
your brows before and you have sparse
brows try it out try it out and see if
you can get something that's a little
less expensive you know go for the
Knicks go for the lorry Allison like
that and try it out and you might really
like it it's a little bit shopping at
first I think when you don't have browns
and you've really blonde hair I have one
of teachers I used to work with she has
blonde hair no brows like you cannot see
her brows and I convinced her to do her
brows and she was like oh my gosh I'm
getting so many complements all except
and I'm like I know right but it took
her a little while to get used to it
because you're not used to seeing that
on your face so definitely try it out if
you haven't pancake says I got a sample
of the milk brow pencil it's a gel
pencil and she likes it neca says a
24-hour brow pomade is nice because it's
got fibers to help fill it in which one
of you talk Oh it cosmetics its meaning
it cosmetics interesting it's got fibers
help fill it in very cool very cool
alright so um jessica says also has a
decent brow pencil too nice all right tu
mundo it is 5 19 I saw the table full
stuff all right foundations that's going
to be a little Wally's and gentlemen
foundation so many different types of
face evening out products it's crazy how
many women so let's start with BB creams
in CC
Heba Crimson see screams all right the
difference between I get asked this all
the time if you already know this answer
I apologize for born in a fast for a
little bit if you're watching on the
replay you're watching it like I've
you've gotta wait for me to be done all
right BB creams and CC creams big
difference between these and foundations
is that number one they tend to have
skincare benefits they throw all kind of
stuff throw SPF in them and they throw
anti aging stuff for the end throw-in
stuff that's supposed to be a benefit to
your skin okay now BB cream is called a
beauty balm this one is more typically
more like a tinted moisturizer a little
less coverage CC cream color correcting
cream typically a little more coverage a
little closer to a foundation but still
both having skin care benefits so you
guys think about what kind of coverage
you want you want less coverage go for
BB cream little more coverage go for CC
cream we good good good okay umm Ali
said that CC cream is really amazing it
is really nice product but the shades a
little off for me the one that I have I
need to get a different one Cheryl says
oh she also something that aqua seal I
don't know make it for ever aqua seal
Nellie says how do you feel about Rimmel
lasting finish it's one of my favorites
I've never used it I think Cassie
reviewed it though and I think she
thought it was awesome I remember that
video Emma says I think it under on an
under rated foundation is the gosh
exception a long wear foundation I've
never heard of that it's light and
moistening but I still love the coverage
just thought I'd throw it out there's
just no one talks about it interesting
mm-hmm Deanna says I loved it cosmetics
CC cream everybody since love that stuff
I like it too I like it too so BB cream
CC cream good yes to the CC jennifer
says Tracy says the CC is the only BB
and CC I like the SEC is only cc's like
um castithan terrific says the covergirl
clean my BB cream is a game-changer for
oily skin the only BB that sticks on me
thank you for that all right bebe and
CeCe now let's say you put on your BB
and CC cream one of the other you put on
your foundation it's a little too light
of leverage you want to go for a powder
foundation ok powder that's what I'm
wearing today on my face I'm wearing a
powder foundation I'm actually wearing
which is the Mary Kay one it's really
really nice actually but powder
foundation I can't feel in my opinion
that if you're a makeup person this is
something you should have in your
arsenal you should have some kind of
powder foundation whether it's a mineral
loose mineral powder foundation like
this one or press one like this you
should have one because it's really nice
to add on to your foundation or like
today when I didn't feel like doing my
foundation I just wanted a little bit of
coverage just a little bit just to get
me you know little more Matt's little
more little bit of evening out of the
skin tone without a lot of hassle if you
like a light coverage you may be able to
just use this and cut out the whole
counter step and make your morning
routine or your evening routine go a
little bit faster really really let
these please watch this is the
toothpaste one smells like chocolate I
just got to smell it all the time smells
amazing smells absolutely amazing and
then this one is the mineral version
anytime you get anything loose like this
it's going to be a little messy um just
be aware of that but I think it's
totally worth it in my opinion I really
like it a lot so I definitely recommend
buying one of these kinds of products
maybe not Sara Lee these brands it's up
to you these are two that i like but
there's there's lots of good ones out
there Sheila says I use powder
foundation as a setting powder too yes
exactly and and it gives a little bit of
extra coverage to it's very nice
Carolina says bare minerals is the best
powder foundation the original one and
Ali says they make great foundations for
pale girls who is this it makes great
foundations for pale girls I want to
know animal rescue geek I like the it
powder Laura Mercier mineral powder
christa says powder foundation makes my
makeup cakey and I don't even put that
much on what brand are you using
girlfriends wow that's not good um I
don't know I'd be curious to know what
the oily skin girls think about that um
about the whole making your makeup cakey
so I would imagine it would be more
accentuated with someone with oily skin
as far as the kinkiness um I don't know
I've never had that problem that's just
me personally so hi Alma Alma so she's
like that's okay girlfriend
Elizabeth says there are minerals makes
your skin itch oh no I'm left to teach
says I like the maybelline fit me 110
matte and poreless pancake says my skin
is too dry for powder foundation even if
you put like a like a tinted moisturizer
or something hydrating on underneath Wow
animal rescue geek says if you're cakey
try setting spray that's what I use see
this is what the collective brain is all
about us all helping each other find
solutions this is pretty awesome Pam
says I am oily and I can put powder on
for days alright next kind of foundation
is one that I'm not particularly fond of
and it is the the cushion foundations
not the biggest fan of cushion
foundations this is the Physicians
Formula One and I can tell you the big
reason why I'm not a fan of these is
because they typically contain half as
much product and they're typically twice
as expensive and i don't think that
they're worth the price tag that people
are pulling on these I think it's insane
I do tend to like the application of it
of these I do but like this one in
particular I don't know well you know
what it was the l'oreal one that didn't
last a super long time but i do like i
just like to finish of it but i just
think the place is just out we just
absolutely outrageous and they are kind
of gimmicky Jennifer says of cushion
seem give it to me I think that they are
they're definitely gimmicky Cheryl says
I find that when you get older powder
foundations make you look older that's
good to know sahaja says I normally just
use foundation and then translucent
powder else mineral foundation like bare
minerals if I want a lighter look and
karen says I think cushion foundations
are a waste too much money for too
little product and Pam says good to know
about the ready formula and then Animal
Rescue keep says that cushion is
gimmicky nellie's does not into cushions
I got rid of the l'oreal lumi it's too
sheer and things to my dry patches and
then kin says I don't like cushion
foundations and Alma says it has no
coverage um and Cassie says yeah
American Christian foundations / donkey
Lissa yeah hmm that sums it up it sums
it up Rosie says seems like not a lot
product for a cost yeah absolutely and
Alma says physicians formula makes
terrible foundations anyway back it says
the CC veil is worth every
any it does something wonderful for my
skin in the winter nice um so I you know
I think it's a nice idea but i agree i
think it is a little bit gimmicky and I
hate the price point I hate the price
point I think it's ridiculous absolutely
ridiculous art two more come three more
kinds of foundation yeah three more cons
of foundation all right next up these
guys are kind of similar these are kind
of similar actually there should be four
more Constitution thinking about it
there is a typical liquid foundation I
don't think we need to go too much in
the liquid foundations because that's
kind of the standard these are kind of
the beard ones show liquid foundation
exists I should probably get one those
are traditional all right there's a
couple of liquids that are that I really
like a lot this one I really like I
don't nobody talked about this this is
the Maybelline Dream velvet really like
this one a lot it's a soft match so it's
not like super matte but it's got a nice
coverage and just these are really
pretty looked at the skin this is
another one I like this one's more Matt
this is the Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless I really like that this one's a
little bit more full coverage I like
this one a lot for filming this is the
born this way by Too Faced this is
really nice but I'm not going to spend
all for a lot of time in regular
foundations because this is about the
weird stuff so boom pancakes as
foundations are so skin specific so hard
to get recommendations and I completely
agree that's why we're here in the
collective brain sure we can all help
each other because when you tell me why
works for dry skin oily skin combo scam
we can all work together to spread the
information that's the most important
Grady says Jen was the one who gave me
advice on what foundation where for my
wedding Estee Lauder Double Wear holla
and it was killer yes I remember that
great alright so we've stick foundations
and then these pancake he kind of
foundations pancake foundations go way
back like estee lauder and the good old
a good old Glory's makeup this is the
the time bomb by the ball ruler full
coverage ooh super full coverage um what
I don't like about this is I filled it
collects dirt and dust and the up in the
pan because it is kind of a you know
it's a creamy formula and for whatever
reason it's collecting it kinkier and I
don't know why it's not like I leave it
open I don't know but really
full-coverage like cake face full covers
like when I didn't really i like to use
with these i like to use a beauty
blender because i feel like i can get
the i can get it where I want without
too much like I kind of dab a little bit
on I put my Beauty Blender in here or
whatever sponge i'm using I put it in
here and I just kind of dab a little bit
and then i blend it in and it works
really really well Elmo says it's sticky
this one can be definitely definitely um
and then the stick foundations I feel
like our kind of the same and that you
can get more coverage I feel like with a
stick foundation this is the new
hourglass one I got it with FC points
I'm still testing it out mine is in the
shade nude and it works pretty well for
my skin I don't have a verdict on this
yet but I did want to show it to you
jennifer says pancake makeup is perfect
for the stage absolutely when I you so
when I was in phase when I was in high
school week that's all we used Rose says
OMG stick foundation can you say Ben Nye
yeah all right um let's see pancakes are
always a good idea Sheila says make up
for ever stick has a beautiful finish
good to know it has anyone tried the
Anasazi Beverly Hills stick out yet I
know I have not um Nellie says she wants
the hourglass so bad if you have FC
points they've got a bunch of them still
over there kitty says the elf stick
foundations are fantastic still can't
believe that they're gone I know right
so upset about that they got rid of them
hopefully they come out with a new brand
another grant but a new version of it
sherry says are you a teacher Jen I was

on the l6 good job Cherie I used to
teach I was a resource teacher I taught
fourth grade for a couple years
I was a special educational resource
teacher for the rest of the time all
right so anybody else want to say
anything else about foundation um animal
rescue eat said I didn't do an amazing
job with YouTube thank you so much and
Seth says VMAs might have a tendency to
suck tonight how did we end up on the
VMA i'm curious in see what's gonna
happen with that too um Rose says I
don't look old enough for that I am 38
years old so I actually took a while to
graduate from college karen says Mac

foundation back in the 90s good to know
Monica live chat started at five so
about 30 minutes ago let's see Maria
says honestly for every day I use wet
and wild cover off foundation works fine
for me and for more special occasions
makeup studio foundations are amazing if
you can find them live chat next week is
10 a.m. eastern time so Heidi says you
don't look old enough to have work that
long haul thank you so much I appreciate
that and sherry says thanks I'm at 31
years old 31 years teaching bless you
bless you 31 years teaching bless you
bless you bless you all right last kind
of foundation I forgot one more breaking
out the serum foundation see your own
foundations this is the bare minerals
bare skin pure brightening serum
foundation plug my lipsticks cake and
I'm going alright serum foundation see
our foundation I actually kind of like
because you can build it up you can
start off with a really light coverage
and build it up really easily this one
in particular I'm not the biggest fan of
I don't like the way that it wears down
I've gotta find that it kind of breaks
up on the skin as it wears down I feel
like you know even when I shake it and
get it all mix before I use it it just
doesn't seem to apply the way that I
want it to apply on the hourglass
immaculate is close to a serum
foundation but not really but I like
that one a lot better the hourglass one
what makes it a serum is that it's
supposed to have good help good skincare
benefits and you've got this little
drippy thing let me get a brush reflects
I can show you so I got rid of the brush
that I bought with it i bought the bare
minerals brush that came with it but
i'll show you so what you do is you go
like this and you drop on a minute come
on you're going to drop your what are
you doing here
she drop it onto the brush like this and
it's like drippy and then we go I'll put
someone I'd blush on but it's going to
go way out and then you just kind of
hangs it on let that won't know if you
can tell the difference that would be
all lopsided on my face but that's how
that works is it's like a drippy kind of
thing and it's supposed to have like
serum e kinds of things so yeah you know
what's great roast she says nice the
older folks here as well I'm 53 I have
such a range of viewers like if I look
at my stats I have viewers from
teenagers all the way up to viewers in
their 60s so it makes me really happy
that a lot of people a lot of different
ages can enjoy my channel it's pretty
awesome Tracy says she's been a teacher
for 23 years bless you as well Sabrina
says my daughter absolutely loves the
bare mineral serum foundation it didn't
work for me but she's only 18 so that's
good to know so maybe it might work for
younger people Elizabeth says they feel
the same way about bear Merrill serum I
thought I was the only one I love the
validation when we can agree on
something and it's like how the same way
it's like yes yeah Byrne says not old
but sure exactly 60 years yeah one one
of my best friends is 60 so you know we
can all hang out um all right I was
thinking I think if I had any like
really younger here's my paws for
something I was thinking to do I have
any really young friends and I don't
look so my friends are older all right
it's anyway or my my age or older all
right but anyway I'm not opposed to
anybody young to go I just don't have
any interaction with people that are
that much younger than me so Molly's
here she's 16 yeah that's awesome Molly
all right let's move on let's talk about
some blush all right blush products so
lots of different kinds of blush
products we have the traditional power
blush this is a tart blush in the shade
tipsy I don't know what is going on here
with the pigmentation of it powder
blushes can range from very very
pigmented and give you clown-faced very
easily to very buildable I feel like
they're the easiest to work with powder
foundations overall if it kind of
depends on the formula though because
some of them can be super super
pigmented and take the
wat to blend out and some of them take a
lot of work to build up but I feel
compared no you know what I'm gonna back
up on that I don't think they're easy to
work with because there's such a
variation I'm like as I'm talking out
loud I'm like no I don't agree with what
I just said um that I don't I feel like
these are kind of in the middle they can
be easy to work with but then they can
be bad they give you hard to work with
nightly fall says i love powder blushes
because you can build them up sometimes
you sometimes you can't I think it
depends on the formula if you liked our
blushes are really famous for being very
easy to build up start off nice and
light and build it up amazingness but
actually my favorite kind of formula to
work with our cream blushes and let me
tell you what stick with me here stick
with me here why I like them I'd like
them because I feel like you take your
finger like this I put on foundation so
I'm gonna see if I can do this here so I
can make my cheeks match again I totally
don't even match like the two sides of
my face look completely different I
don't even care alright so I'll go like
that it looks really dark and crazy
right and I select it I smack myself a
little bit and now plush and I just get
super easy it's just really easy to work
with stippling brush works great but
love cream blushes love them I feel like
they just look so pretty the way they
blend into the skin just super super
easy to work with Billy about cream
blushes is you have to kind of be
careful with whatever counter you're
using if you've got a power one because
you can take up in the plush and it can
make it look a little funky if you've
got powder and mix it with the cream
that can be kind of weird so I try to
since I use a lot of cream blush I tried
to wait till you do powder until the
very end I do like a finishing powder at
the end and sometimes they don't put any
powder at all recently because the
luminous look has been so popular and I
don't have particularly oily skin I
haven't been using a lot of powder
lately so really really like cream
blushes Pacific they're super easy so
you've never tried a cream blush
definitely recommend trying it cyr says
I use cream blushes with a small elf
stippling brush and I do exactly the
same thing fantastic Becca says not into
cream blushes I feel like you can use
lipstick and get the same results well
that's true what was fun okay don't
forget your lipstick use your lipstick
if you want to do you think and carolyn
says she hates cream blush yeah
so they've never tried cream blush and
marina says cream blushes don't look
good on touch your skin because of
machine well there you go good to know
what does it depend so because this one
doesn't have shine to it this one has I
mean it looks like it's got a shy but it
doesn't but not on my face well no shine
I think depends on the formula using
maybe you're using a formula scott shine
to look at this one doesn't this one I
didn't say what it was did I Fiona this
is by Bobby Brown and it is the small
one it is a sample because I very rarely
back full sizes this is the pot rouge
for lips and cheeks in the shade blushed
rose and I love this one for winter I
think it's a beautiful winter color but
I wear it all year but I especially like
for winter um I see Jenny says I don't
like cream highlighter blush and you
know what I don't like is cream contour
can I get a handle on cream contour to
save my stinking life would much rather
use your powder contour cannot use cream
cream contour at all cream highlights I
can kind of get behind but my favorite
cream sheet product is definitely got to
be cream blushes I'm really really like
them this one is is it locks eyes sample
it's not a full-size Kaylee Sheila says
I just ordered the nude sticks lip and
cheek can't wait to try let me know what
you think sahaja says Jen you need to
try the milk makeup blush oils you will
love them good to know vanessa says
cream blush it was scary for me did you
see how these not what Vanessa Vanessa
just tell you that was just put on your
face when you smack yourself a few times
and it blends in it's so easy it's so
easy cream contour tend to be too orange
marina i agree with you i totally agree
with you sherry says she loves to make
up new since you so much i appreciate
that elizabeth said i also use the small
stippling brush with cream brushes or
cream blushes it works great exactly oh
my games green products can be good for
at least getting put and put it on first
put your foundation on which cream blush
on put your powder on top you solid your
solid that's my opinion people with oily
skin color no better than me but that's
my thought I don't have a little skin so
I can only speak from an outsider's
perspective so you know oh speaking of
cream blushes another product that i
really like now this is something if you
have texture you don't want this is by
julep and this was part of a sponsored
video but this video is not sponsored
this
is the cream to powder blush stick and
golden guava shiny shiny shiny shiny
shiny shiny shiny if you let text if you
have texture skin it's going to look
really good but if you don't it's very
pretty let me swatch a little bit see
that shine from my shine so much it's
got a little bit of gold like glittery
kinds of stuff on there um I really like
this one a lot I feel get melds into the
skin during nicely but I can see why
some people would not like this at all I
like blush sticks I like blush tips I
like cream blushes I left them since I
first started playing with makeup like
really into makeup when I first are my
channel almost four years ago I really
really was into the Sephora cream blush
was my favorite but now I really like
the julep sticks and I really let the
body brown those are really really nice
now color pop is kind of its own entity
it's kind of its own entity color pop
has it the spongy weird texture to it
it's very odd um I think of all color
pop products I probably like the cream
blushes are one of my favorite thing is
the cream blushes and cream highlights
they're not powder they're not quite
cream they're just weird like I don't I
don't really know they're almost a good
clay is kind of what it feels like if
you can see that but I feel like these
kind of lay on the skin instead of
melding into the skin like the Queen
products that I have and the UM and the
sticks products that I have I mean you
can get them to go in but I mean I like
them but I wouldn't go out of my way to
get more it's one of those kind of
things like I'm happy to have the ones i
have but not kind of my favorites um
psycho pics he says adore colour-pop
getting sorry about that getting an
order tomorrow and I cannot wait what
are you getting are you getting blushes
that's what I want to know carolyn says
becca blushes are nice but again they
frequently freaking break me out oh my
gosh oh sorry that's terrible well you
know abeka that stuff doesn't last on me
for some reason
no Natalie says the makeup revolution
cream blush sticks are nice and steph
says she has the color pop she had wait
I have like all the colour-pop
highlighters do you like I like them
Nellie says color pop everything is for
jam just generally says love color pop
blushes another person said color pop
you went away too fast and missed it I
love to teach says I need to try color a
color pop one Natalie says where can i
buy color pop is it in stores in the
states to know it's only on the
colour-pop website that's the only place
you can buy that I don't feel like
they've branched out at all Tina says i
love the natasha to know no blush rose
moment go on there a little out of my
price range it's only for special
occasion krishna says color pop needs to
open their own store totally agree i
would imagine they would've actually
because they are blowing up blowing up
alright so I've got one more blush for
me we got 20 minutes left and I said I
get through eyeliners I shadows and lip
products so let me show you these ok
this is the Sephora cheek gel and these
are chance from benefit these are
calling my least favorite blush formula
the liquid e kind this one goes on your
face and then promptly disappears
stinking horrible horrible product do
not like it at all these are the
opposite they go in cheek and then they
stay there like a stain and they don't
move they are really difficult to work
with thankfully though benefit didn't
make them have a ton of pigment so you
can you don't have the state like it's
just they're just really hard yes
exactly Nellie says blush tints always
end up strictly on me exactly that's
what I'm talking about um absolutely
they're just they're really hard to work
with the only one that I personally like
that I've ever try to try the ball is
one I've tried all of these from benefit
the only one I really like is actually
by a brand called Elizabeth moss which
does a lot of they do allow stuff of
subscription boxes and it's called tints
and sass and that one's actually pretty
good but you still have to kind of tap
it out to get it to work so you know um
yeah so i don't really like these i
don't recommend them I feel like they're
difficult to work with and
not my favorites that's that's my
personal opinion all right is there
anything else that we need to talk about
about blushes before we move on let's
see um Cyr says okay not hearing good
things about those tents so i don't
think i will try them yeah that they're
not good i'm carolyn says stains are a
big no-no um love to teach says looks
like not sure which one which snores are
talking about Scarlett says I just
looked it up the dids cosmetics today
this will behind you yeah Lulu mm it's
very interesting website digna says I'm
so excited to see this is my first time
in lab chat yay hopefully I said your
name right and then what about spray
blushes Cheyenne I don't own any spray
bushes that sounds scary I don't like to
spray anything on my face and anything
with color in it really freaks me out so
never never never would I ever not in a
box with a fox not on a plane with a
stain no never I will never get a spray
blush look thing that never say never
cuz I could do it as a like joke but no
no thank you no thank you all right eye
shadow got 15 minutes left eye shadow
I'm Seth says like people just oh you
talk I know strung about art Christmas
says jenny don't want to instant clown
face oh no not a good idea from that
success all right eye shadow of course
there's traditional eyeshadow there's a
single there's the there's palette
there's singles of powder eyeshadow
honestly powders a way to go if you have
never really gotten into eyeshadow if
you've never um if you know a lot of
experience with makeup you've gotta do
powders powders is like the best easiest
way to apply eyeshadow in my opinion I
don't feel like that there's there's
anything else that anybody should be
doing unless you just you're bored okay
if you're bored with powder eyeshadows
tons of other options but if you're not
bored and you're still trying to figure
it out please though with copper because
I feel like it's like the easiest way to
learn how to do eyeshadow I shot as my
favorite topic to Cheyenne
um and Sarah this is my favorite too
okay the only exception to this rule is
one exception to my just by powder thing
and that is for if you just want an
all-over lid color and all over the lid
color so today I am wearing the
maybelline color tattoo I chrome is the
only one of these that I own having a
lot of fun with it today's the first day
I've worn it and I just put this on my
lids one and done and it's got such a
pop of color powders can be especially
pressed powders can take a lot of
building to give you intensity to give
you that Bob that pop that BAM so if you
want the pop in the fam you want to
either go with the pigment or you want
to go with a crimp okay um who said
they're out who's leaving here somebody
just said I'm out whatever that was I
missed you have a great week I missed it
so yes that's what I'm trying to say so
so using powder eyeshadow i feel like is
the easiest thing to do kind of a step
up in pas penis would be to use some
mineral eye shadows my favorite brand of
mineral eyeshadow is called geek chic
cosmetics I love me some geek chic
cosmetics such a unique shades and II
brands is the way to go from mineral eye
shadows for loose powder pigments and II
brands is what's up because they come up
with such unique colors that you just
can't get anywhere else same thing with
nail polish I find it with nail polish
you can really get some unique fun
colors when you're talking about um any
brands with nail polish and with loose
eyeshadow pigments check the smile okay
this one is probably my favorite pigment
of all time it's called luck dragon it's
named after Falkor from the neverending
story and it is this gorgeous king if
you're ready able to see this on I was
going to do it justice i'm not looking
at myself but oh my gosh oh my gosh it
takes my breath away takes my breath
away this is the thing all right Ali
says I'm so over this shadow and that's
where I was fun sounds messy girlfriend
it is really really nothing like this
has a scepter in it but it's still super
messy really really messy and
that's just something you deal with when
you deal with loose powder to anything
loose powder foundation loose powder
powder or loose powder eyeshadow is it
can be very messy so just be prepared
for that but you can get some amazing
really fun fun fun fun colors krista
says I only use takis LOC shadow sticks
for quick looks yeah and and that I have
like I have taught these ones but I also
have like the julep one this was this
was not part of sponsored video this is
something that I had already this is the
one in stone this is a really nice
Oliver lid color if you want your eyes
to look more deep set if you want your
eyes be more deep set you want to put
them in shadow so you you can use a
darker color to do that that's kind of
the way that my eyes are today if you
wanted to kind of pop out then that's
when you use like a lighter shade to
kind of make them pop so these are
really nice I mean and also of the is it
Laura Mercier yes the laura mercier ones
are really really good to my friendly
Cinda it just swears by the laura
mercier ones um let's see Becca says
I've tons of loose powder eyeshadow
pigments and I don't ever touch me more
because I think that they're they're
kind of a pain to get out and use I know
for me personally personally for me
personally for me personally I feel like
I would reach for a pallet Irish my
palette over my single shadows because
it's less thinking with a palette you've
got everything you need all together for
the most part with individual shadows
you kind of have to pick and mix and
match and figure out which ones go with
which ones so I find a lot of that too
you know that that I need to think more
with my individual ones so an accusing
my palettes more often but if you want
more punchy color you may want to try
pigments also I've got on with the
shadows the cream shadow version you've
got these this was dealing when I like i
said the selling one that i own and this
today's the first day i'm wearing it so
i can't really review it but i like it
so far first impression the knicks cream
shadows I think I hated these if i
remember right think they're a little
chunky if i remember right it's been a
really long time since i've used this i
just brought it out and i'm pretty sure
it was chunky pretty sure but that kind
of idea is kind of what i what i wanted
to show you also the the to kind of go
along with that the color tattoos the
ones that are in the pot
one's actually my favorite this one is
in bad to the bronze this one's a really
nice all over lid shade and see if I can
find a spot i'm running out of skin here
if you can how much you can see that but
it's really nice also the elf smudge box
are really good this one is in cruising
chic are too bad to the bronze now
looking at them together so that's
cruising chic by elf and then that's bad
to the bronze by Maybelline so those are
really nice but what my problem with the
liquids and the creams as I find them
difficult to make more than one color
work together um if I want to know one
eye shadow look super easy to do um for
using powders and creams sometimes they
just don't play well together and it
makes it more difficult so you might not
want to use a cream or stick with the
powder it just it just adds so much
effort if you don't necessarily need to
add into your life you got enough going
on in your leg probably that you don't
need extra drama and it might cause
extra trauma in your life Cyr is those
bad to the bronze is lovely it really is
it's very nice Cheryl says I like to use
the smudge pots under my eye because
they don't move getting like as a lower
lashline ice great idea sandy says I'm a
powder eyeshadow fan for life but I've
been dying to try one of the by Terry
since they're just so expensive I know
right I know Kate Lee says I have a
palette I only used like 5 out of 12
colors because I have a favorite I look
I love that to the bronze too yeah
definitely Nancy says what do you think
of the touch and so I cream Nancy sent
me to touch and so like rain let me show
you I you i've swatched it where is it
it's in my opinion i've swatched it i
have not put on my eye i had to choose
today between the Maybelline and this
one Nancy when I'm gonna get it out it's
right here here we go touchin soul Nancy
you're amazing Nancy sent me this too
right here she got me the one in let's
see what shape is this this is in
adelie oh I believe a swatch of these
are pretty pricey and I don't think
they're easy to get look at that look at
that crony beautifulness so that's the
cream part and then the glitter part
actually I'm gonna do two swatches I'm
going to do the one with litter over top
and one without glitter on top okay will
do the glitter by itself too so we'll do
glitter whoo kind of crumbling on me
okay okay so here well okay there's a
glitter there is a glitter with the
cream and then there's the cream by
itself just Oh moguls but I haven't put
on my eyes yet is that so many things
that I'm testing out Nancy so many
things so many things in 77 things I've
been into the old appalling trying to
kinda test the oldest stuff for the
review for the brand review so i will
get it on my eyeballs it just didn't
happen today try to flex some of this
off with my towel but i'm going crazy
with my swashplate now oh my goodness
only five minutes left ah Nancy says
it's kind of a darker one because the
only one that was left yet but it's very
nice I really like it but I felt like
the maybelline color tattoo match my
outfit a little better for today color
pop with the other thing I was going to
talk about last one speaking of color
pop love to teach this um I'm not a big
fan of color pop I shadows for the same
reason I'm not as big of a fan of using
creams in general because I feel like
they're difficult to work with
especially with the cops I feel like
it's hard to get it exactly where I want
it with a brush like brush is very
difficult to use unless you have one of
those really flat brushes it makes it a
little bit easier but I just have
trouble getting it exactly where I want
and it's just kind of annoying i know a
lot of people love these things they're
not my favorites I very rarely reach for
them I just you know I don't know I just
very rarely reach for them and also the
glitter ones I tend to get a lot of
fallout from the glitter ones which I
don't like Nellie says she loves color
pop shadows and now I think a lot of
people agree with you I'm Cindy says I
really love color pop I shadows girl
crush and Bill are perfect
there we go see how trouble yeah fingers
are great for applying eyeshadow you're
absolutely right Jennifer and I think
that um especially if you want a more
TIG mented look using your fingers is a
great way to go analysis fingers worth
Beck that's the club I shadows but I
feel it I get it like all like in the
wrong place when I use my fingers my
fingers are too big for what I want to
do makes it difficult for me I don't
know I don't know Lexie Olivia says I
actually love the color pop shadows I
probably own 30 or 40 I think a lot of
people do I just not my my personal
thanks Nancy agrees me somebody agrees
with me Cheyenne says hi papa shadows
don't stand my lids end up giving most
of mine away I did just give away a
bunch of them um so sahaja I hope you
enjoy them cuz of sahaja scared have you
enjoyed this color box because I had so
much trouble with them alright we have
four minutes and we didn't do eyeliner
and we didn't do lip products we might
skip lip products let's just do eyeliner
because eyeliner I feel like it's really
important to talk about because there
are different kinds of eyeliner and I
feel like they really are for different
purposes I feel more than anything else
here I feel like the formulism eyeliner
really makes a difference in application
huge difference my favorite kind are
Penn liners they really haven't been
around all that long to my knowledge
there was the brush kind for the longest
time was the closer she get to something
like this there's a little brush the end
and he dipped it in and then he pulled
it out and you had some product on the
brush and you put that on and they were
kind of difficult to work with in my
opinion they would smudge and smear so
like this is kind of improvement in my
opinion on the eyeliner formula the pen
tip makes it super easy to go on this
one is the to face sketch marker I'm
just starting to try this out I've out
of it with the Nikki tutorials talent I
so far so good things are going well
with it but I can't give it a full
review yet i'm still in play with it
like one or two times so far i do really
really like it though the Jessie's Girl
want I absolutely love onion get it a
lot of some right age you can get it
Jessie scroll calm you can get it on
Amazon not once amazing it's like seven
bucks and then the toothpaste so fine to
face no tart so fine liner is really
really good and the elf 1 i'm sorry i
really like that one
in my favorites for this month the the
elf one kat von d liquid liner in
trooper Tracy says totally agree Pam
says I didn't care too much for the two
face sketch marker didn't work for you I
would love to know why it didn't work
for you I want to know more about that
sketch markers all I think there were 20
bucks something like that for the sketch
marker best type of eyeliner for hooded
eyes I would probably say something that
sets really fast if you can find a
marker tip that sets really fast I would
go with that because the biggest problem
with eyeliner and people with hooded
eyes is to transfer and if you can't get
it if you can't get to set it transfers
and it's really bad pencil liners might
be a little bit better but this is my
deal with pencil liners I feel like
pencil liners are the most difficult
eyeliner to work with on the upper lash
line unless you want that smudge you
look you can't get away with a pencil
unless it's super super super stinking
sharp like you just you can't get a wing
with it it doesn't work so what I use
these for Sephora pencil liners are
stinking amazing I use them for the
lower lash line just love them for the
lower lash line and they stay on all day
long they're gorgeous one online they
don't stay so much but they definitely
see on the lash line give a beautiful
pop of color they're amazing absolutely
amazing but I have so much trouble on my
upper lash line with pencils just in
general um make a fabulous says I heard
the sketch marker bleeds i have not had
that problem at all but it's good to
know that some people are having that
problem shannon says the Stila stay all
day last time I oily hooded lids I do
like that one that's really good to know
Shane and thank you so much for that
jenna says the seal of one is the best
um I miss the rest of it it went too
fast Cindy says the knicks trade you li
are wonderful for the waterline that's
great to know and karen says pencils are
good for the upper waterline yes for
tight lining for ballmer i'm not going
to do it because it looks really creepy
but i agree absolutely as i wouldn't use
a marker for that kind of thing last
kind of eyeliner because it's 559 I
gotta go supposed to tell my family last
thing I want to tell you about is gel
eyeliners now gel eyeliners my only
complain about gel eyeliners as you got
to have a brush you can't apply these
any other way unless you have a brush
but
they can go on really really smooth
really really easily if you have a nice
fine brush I personally really enjoy a
slanted eye liner brush like the flat
slanted kind you can also use a very
thin one it's really what's best for you
makeup magic says try the unique I tried
one product comunique and I was done I
was I was so mad at that mascara I was
like no more and the people who sell
unique a lot of times can be very very
pushy and I don't like that either so it
kind of a kind of ruined it for me the
whole unique thing I am like oh no I'm
like all jaded now what's up oh my god
it may be amazing I could be totally
wrong this could be totally cuckoo and
something that's amazing but for me I'm
like yeah cuz they they made me mad so
that's just me Tiffany Todd is here Greg
youtube channel hey Pam says the sketch
marker bleeds not fully matte finished
con for her the tip dries out too
quickly it breaks down on her she has
whaley lids and watery eyes gel and
brush is what works for her very good
you understand you tried it makeup magic
that you need so cuz I really that's
just me I don't know Kayleigh says six
in the USA right now it's four in
Alberta yeah it's six o'clock in six
o'clock but for me honestly like my head
if I had to pick any kind of eyeliner
for ease of use I would choose can
liners second close second for the gel
liners and I only use pencil miners for
the lower lash line or for tight lining
I don't use them for upper lash line be
there too hard for me to work I don't
enjoy them it's not fun for me I'm says
I stabbed myself with my sketch marker
edit hurt and anklet into my eye yes
