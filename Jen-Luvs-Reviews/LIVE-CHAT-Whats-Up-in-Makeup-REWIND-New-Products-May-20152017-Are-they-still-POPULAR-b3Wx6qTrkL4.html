Mother's Day to those of you that are
celebrating Mother's Day today and like
I said in the news show just because you
are not biologically a mother
does not mean you cannot have a happy
Mother's Day if you are a mother to a
friend of yours if you are a mother to
an animal child if you are caring toward
your friends and your kind of their
mother it's still Mother's Day for you
if you're male you can still be a mother
to somebody when I think of a mother I
think of someone that's nurturing
someone that cares for you and I feel
like it's synonymous for mother so if
you want to celebrate Mother's Day you
totally should that's my thoughts how's
everybody doing today livestream looks
really really weird this week
so I'm hoping it all looks good because
for me it looks super grayed out thank
you all for being here for live chat I
thought we would do something fun today
something a little bit different
we have looked back at old episodes of
what's a bit make up I've got them cute
on my phone from one year ago two years
ago and three years old and talk about
the products that came out back then and
whether we're still even talking about
these products now where they really
really hyped up where were they not
where they you know are things just they
just came out and then they disappeared
and nobody ever really cared I would I
don't know I thought it'd be fun it's
something we've never done before so I
thought it would be cool now recently I
do want to mention I there there are a
lot of new members of the collective
brain so some people this is the deal if
you're new here this is your first chat
this is video and this what I want to
tell you I'm gonna break it down right
now because I don't want you waste your
time if you don't like the idea of me
talking to the community if you don't
like me going back and forth where I'm
like hi Whitney and a hi Melissa and hi
ginger and hi Kate hi Jenna like if you
don't like that and me like saying you
know Cynthia says good morning Jen you
look a bit slow your Mother's Day what
does that mean I look a bit slow am i
dragging a little bit oh there is a
little bit of a delay
I see what you're talking about there is
a little bit of a delay I don't know if
I can fix that YouTube has been really
weird with the live stream lately and
there's very little that's in my control
but anyway my point is is if you don't
like that you probably will not like
this video but there's so much other
content on my channel that you probably
really will like it's just live chat is
for some people and some people it isn't
for others but if you do like hearing
from other people not just me and it's
no community and being part of a
community this is a great thing to
listen to if you're doing something else
cuz I don't well I'm gonna be showing
some things but it's not 100% necessary
and thousands of people every week love
chat so you might be one of them so if
you think that it's interesting to you
then great if not I'll see you in the
next video and thank you so much for
being here and giving it a try
I appreciate you even if it's not your
thing if it is your thing I appreciate
you no matter what so before we go into
the topic for today I do want to scroll
up and just say quick so a quick hello
so the first people that were here I
believe they're the first people that
were here it's the highest I can scroll
up Denise Liz good morning to both of

hubby went fishing on Mother's Day great
day oh wow well maybe he'll bring you
home some fish and cook you a nice
dinner okay so I hope you know we'll see
okay so the first one we're going to
look at
and if you want to go ahead if you want
to pull this up on your computer and
watch with me you can I'm gonna be
showing it on the screen with I'm gonna
be holding it up like this but this is
the episode and if you want to search
for it you're gonna search for what's up
and make up and then you can type in
two-faced Just Peachy sneak or to pay to
face just peachy and you should be able
to find it you'll see me in this pink
outfit and the thumbnail has the Just
Peachy on it I'm pretty sure so this is
from one year ago today not today one
year ago when was this published May
14th so one year ago tomorrow and let's
see what we were talking about a year
ago so the format looks kind of the same
I haven't changed a ton as far as the
look of what's a good makeup you'll see
the background is different the
background here is just my wall with a
blue light shined on it why I realized
that because it's a blue light I can
actually green-screen the backgrounds as
well blue screen I can chroma key the
background so the background you see now
and what's the makeup is actually an
image that I green-screen and post I
chroma key it in post
so I insert that in editing that spotty
background with the blue and the pink
that is actually not on my wall this is
my actual wall just a little behind the
scenes there so what do you guys think
about that what do you think about that
the Just Peachy mattes do you think
people are still talking about the Just
Peachy mattes this is this was the top
news story that week
know that this Just Peachy max what do
you guys think about that
Joanne says I can't use the two fees to
face products I have a rash on my face
oh my gosh that's terrible I'm so sorry
to hear that I wonder what it was
do you have that problem Joanne with
other products that's crazy Karla is
here happy Mother's Day to you give your
daughter big hugs for me kind of new
here I think she's talking about oh okay
I see a lot of people loving it
Whitney loves it Monica loves it Karina
I just used a loose powder till this I
still use a loose powder till this week
and then I switch the hourglass Oh
Cynthia good morning to you I know I
can't believe was a year ago - oh yeah
I'm wearing a celebration of Mother's
Day I'm wearing my favorite shirts my
super natural voice there they're coming
with me on Mother's Day
violet violet December that palette is
still hyped up for a good reason I think
so too I really really liked this
palette the Just Peachy max I thought it
was great I don't reach for it a lot but
that's not because it's not a great
palette I think I'm just tired of the
warm colors and I think maybe you know
later on in the summer or you know in
the fall I might reach for it more but
for now I'm just not I'm not taking on
those warm peachy looks anymore I'm just
tired of want to do something different
I especially want to have a choice
because I'm not like actively doing like
a palette review in that moment I want
to reach for something a little more
colorful I've been reaching for those
kinds of palettes recently but it still
was a really good palette I really liked
it indigo blue Beauty still love it
going to bust it out for summer nice
Erin formal oh so soft and velvety it's
amazing
good morning goddess 131 Alyson I love
my peach palette I didn't think I would
but I do Julie says I still need to try
the foundation have some weight
I still need to try foundation have too
many stuff to wait I like the palette
though and Amy it's her favorite palette
ever all right let's keep going and see
what's next this is a 20-minute show
colors according to their Instagram they
started with a waiting list of 25,000
people but ended up with orders for more
than 250,000 units in just one week they
promise that they're working around the
clock both in production and in
fulfillment and in November they will be
moving to a new facility that will
increase capacity by 450 percent just to
start they promised that quote once we
are in a better place and back on track
as the ordinary changed since then if
you don't know the drama about the
ordinary the owner of the ordinary his
name is Brandon he owns a parent company
called deci I'm that owns the ordinary
and a bunch of other brands and he has
been having some social media challenges
let's just say he's been I don't know I
guess you could say he's been he's very
unique and he runs the social media and
a lot of people don't agree with the way
he runs it he's been you know kind of
freaking people out and in doing weird
livestreams and you know I don't know
the the latest update because I haven't
been keeping up on what's going on with
Brandon but but this was a high point
for them when their foundation came out
that was a huge high point everybody was
really excited about that foundation do
you remember when that came out
everybody freaked out about that
foundation it was it was absolutely
crazy
you know how out you know and that was
when I don't remember him participating
on social media more than just posting a
picture that he was in another country
or you know like selfie kinds of things
um Steph says he's flat out too rude to
people I have seen that he's just a very
unique soul very unique kind of person
so so yeah so they've been having some
trouble with their you know people being
unhappy with the way that he runs things
and people no longer buying from the
ordinary because of that and you know I
don't know I mean I personally haven't
bought anything from the ordinary very
in a very very long time and I don't
know I mean I'm not sure if I don't
think I
boycott I don't know but I did hear he
did say some anti-semitic things which I
can kind of see why they would have been
taken anti-semitic I don't want to like
I don't want to quote him because I
don't want to get it wrong but having
being you know technically Jewish my
mother is Jewish so I am technically
Jewish and I'm about 50/50 percent uh is
it Oscar
actually I'm so embarrassed ah I can't
say it it starts with it's the AG Oscar
huh I'm gonna say it wrong that's
terrible
I don't know how to pronounce it if I
read it I'm better like I'm terrible at
reading it but anyway so I'm 50% that I
got a genetics test I'm 50% my mom's
side is completely Jewish 100% so so
yeah yeah Ashkenazi Ashkenazi thank you
so much Ashkenazi it's not in my
long-term memory thank you everybody
Ashkenazi Thank You Abby I feel so
disrespectful and I'm so sorry to
anybody that was felt upset that I
didn't know how to pronounce that
it's not in my long-term memory but it
should be it absolutely should be so
anyway you know anybody that that you
know says anything again against any
nationality whether it's mine or
somebody else's I am not about that I'm
not okay with that so I don't know I
mean there's so many skincare options
out there the ordinary is very unique in
that it is less expensive but my
personal experience with the ordinary
products was that I found them to be
just ok because what I understand about
skincare is this is and their
dermatologist esthetician is out there
if I am wrong please correct me but this
is from my research what I understand is
that a lot of skincare ingredients work
best when they're mixed together because
there's certain ingredients that help
skin care to penetrate the skin and also
certain ingredients really work well
balancing each other so if you go to the
ordinary and you get a bottle of
something that is just a single
ingredient it may not work as well as if
it is mixed in with other ingredients
now the ordinary does have a bunch of
different lines that you have mixes of
different things you
even the ordinary even the ordinary has
like the buffer I think is one of them
that's like a mix of different things
but I don't know I'm just me
but yeah I never tried the foundation I
never used it I don't know much about it
so I heard that it was good though I did
let's go ahead and keep going because
this is a long show let me see if
there's a there's a something that's not
that interesting we'll skip it because I
want to get to other shows to curious
okay we will go through this whole thing
but basically there was a subscription
box called so schwa it was a luxury
beauty sampling program and they just
disappeared off the map one day they
just went out of business and that was
what was about yea buffets Thank You
muffin Buffett that was what I meant so
let's just skip that one oh she said
this is a quote from her we don't think
read it as a place for actual
warm-blooded human being so we're not
fazed by that thread because of course
that's exactly what a reddit thread
would say right it is probably one of
the most disgusting places on earth and
something we're not concerned about that
was a quote from social ah in an email
to somebody Wow
so anyway okay so let's see what's next
yeah they went out of business so
basically you look at your nipples to
find your perfect nude lipstick shade
and I actually saw this as a brand new
article yesterday in the newsfeed but
not because I type in on makeup news
into Google and see what I see they're
recycling the story and by the way
excellent writing tabatha that was all
but yeah I don't know if that works do
you think that works when you like look
down at your your your nipples to see
your your perfect new Jade I don't know
I honestly haven't ever tried it I never
like I just don't think about that I
don't look at myself like that you know
I don't know I thought that was kind of
funny but yeah that was all tab writing
look at this picture in the tab tab
found not hilarious okay we got another
story including hair and nail care and
makeup and Kay beauty and skincare of
private label brands such as NYX and elf
the comedy um I just read here who was
it
oh I lost it oh hey Estie says so your
perfect nude changes when you get
pregnant I guess so I guess so one crowd
I forgot that Riley Rose was related to
forever 21 that now they're like they
seem to be everywhere Riley Rose that's
interesting okay is it not skipping now
okay okay here we go they'll soon be on
another kids to your collection
Venezuela guarna Marielle Marrero is in
collaboration with igx
cosmetics to soon launched her first
three lip kids Marrero has worked with
companies such as L'Oreal snow and color
pop in the past but decided to take her
biology degree and love for makeup just
on her own line there was I haven't
heard anything about that since then I
wonder what happened to them
I don't know hmm yeah I don't know I
you all familiar with her I'm not I
missed that I don't know what happened
there she started her own line no no
Torre says lady like did a video on
nipple color lipstick Shay it was a
great video oh good to know thank you so
much for that mr. Ashton said had to
look so funny yeah I mean how are you
now skincare line philosophy is trying
to change awareness month philosophy
known for their hope and grace
initiative is launching me how are you
really campaigning the company wants to
take the question and turn it into an
honest conversation I don't remember
that either at all I don't remember them
doing much with that since then that's
interesting I don't know it's
interesting how there can be like
campaigns from different brands and then
they come and they go and then you
forget about them it's kind of
interesting I don't know hmm Beth says
hey I didn't know you could go live in
chat how cool I know right it's super
cool it's really fun this is the video
from last May yes
so let's skip that cuz there's so many
good things to talk about it appears
that in general have something to say
about when where and how much makeup
it should wear oh my gosh I think I'm
pretty sure I got comments about this
one that people some people did not like
that story but I mean I don't think
anything's changed I do still think that
there are people out there not just men
but people in general who think that
women only wear makeup to impress other
people like I'm sure that some people do
but I don't think that that's what a lot
of people wear makeup for at least
that's not what I make wear makeup for
no but yeah
Nana what happened to NYC uh what was
that story that was a while back I know
that they went out of they completely go
out of business or I don't think they
completely went out of business they
just stopped selling in the United
States I believe which is weird because
they're NYC yeah Lisa says I wear it for
myself
Cindy says nope I wear makeup for me
Cynthia I think men think women should
look naturally perfect some do and some
women think other women should look
naturally perfect to Jenny I think
people in general can be deceptive
doesn't have to be makeup that's true
and maybe that's it maybe it's just our
our desire not to be deceived and then
some people push that into the whole
makeup thing like that if you wear
makeup you're deceiving people in what
you actually look like I don't know I
think it's all about perspective on that
one and how much experience people have
with makeup - yeah NYC just disappeared
yes it did now NYC is in the UK isn't
that weird that NYC is in the UK but not
in the United States yup exactly exactly
yeah I forget when when they disappear
but we did cover that in one episode
probably not in this one though alright
there's a thing about VidCon VidCon
events I know that's coming up again as
well what is what is this okay here we
go we're getting into the product report
y'all ready for the product report we're
21 minutes okay so we got a few minutes
go through the product report so we did
change the format a little bit this is
makeup and beauty deals we moved the
deals to the end of the show so that's
new since last year yep yay or nay
Nicole represent Jeffrey has changed a
lot he's definitely changed a lot in the
past year as far as his look he keeps
changing but I'm pretty kenny buddy
any problems anybody you know advancing
their look in one way or another a
little bit back then back then we
reported everything like until January
we reported everything like little kits
and stuff like this we stopped doing
that as a show we stopped reporting on
you know single eye pencils and lip
pencils and things that we didn't think
anybody would really care about a whole
lot so this is Yvonne she set at this
point in the show it's kind of boring I
don't know I've never tried that oh I do
own one of those I do own one of those
color paint shadows got it at Sephora
vib Rouge this year and it breaks up on
my eye it's not smooth I saw someone
using it in a I had someone using it in
a in the tutorial and I bought it and I
don't like it
tab says all so back then we didn't have
the makeup minute to fill with those yes
we did actually because this was only a
year ago so we were doing the makeup
minute back then but I mean but now we
do put them put those in the makeup
minute you're right tab would you put
those in the makeup minute now a lot
well I don't know we don't put the bore
and stuff in the makeup minute we put
good stuff for that make a minute
because we're good we're good team high
five tab I skip ahead a little bit
did you see me talking about Christine
it was because it was something that
wasn't holographic so I don't know this
isn't see it's like I got bored with
myself watching some of these product
reports and that's why we changed some
of those things
this product was brand new let's talk
about this one hold on oh we've got some
stuff from Troy here we go anybody use
this stuff anymore I didn't try that did

sorry I wish I could reach through the
camera and give you a

better either I hope that you are able
to get out of that soon because it's
hard to break out of those kinds of
things it's really hard because a lot of
it at some time I'm not gonna try to
diagnose you or anything cuz that's not
a good idea but I hope you I hope you
are able to break out of that soon

over a professional videographer that my
husband knew to help me with my camera
settings so for about two months that
year before my my camera was stolen on

little bit slower of a format so it
looked more cinematic and this was one
of those episodes so I'm a rewind a
little bit my red hair stuff in the
background I do there's like a table
with stuff in the background

liquid and pressed oh my gosh so first

because this is so Robbie to Christie
centric right now I was like my
beginning and like look it's wrong it's
Christie video this video was you

need to see it it's so that was like
that was the beginning of my obsession
with Robbie to Christie two years ago I

or I was about to meet her in New York
City and oh okay so anyway Kat Von D

robbed you Christy I do too I love her I

well Christy is awesome Linda says I saw
Jacqueline's review Kris Jenner eyes
shadow blush looks off oh no oh yeah I
didn't watch Jacqueline's review it
popped up on my suggested feed but I
didn't watch yet sherry says that's how
I found Christy as well her work in the
face word was just incredible it was it
was it was all right so Kat Von D
lock-it Foundation brand-new two years
ago
and vegan launching in July here's a
sneak peak of new artwork for her new
alchemists palette and also studded kiss
duo in Piaf and poo now available on
have on these one did you see The
Alchemist artwork that's so cool that's
so neat that was before we knew the
alchemists palettes that's so cool
Bobby says Jacqueline's was a negative
review oh wow yeah if I like December
yeah two years it does seem like it's
been out forever so yeah so the Lockett
foundation I think dad try that one I
think I did try that one and it was too
thick it was too much and that but the
alchemist I love I love the alchemist
palette so it's so cool to see the it's
so cool to see the artwork for it tab
says OMG the framed picture on the wall
I know I had this weird random flower
picture on my wall there and I figured
it was just blurred out and it was kind
of pretty so and leave it there but it's
very distracting and my opinion now took
me a while to take that picture down
because I really liked it I have one
behind like over here I have another one
but this picture is actually my closet
now because I don't use it anymore
Tiffany says Kristen Dominica is a Kris
Jenner collection but it was um but it
was more positive gotcha good to know
angelic Angela always loved the artwork
a fonzie but she's never enough to buy
excuse me yes yes definitely really good
products though really good products
graveyard girl palette oh my gosh I do
have that too I really like that palette
was it perfect no there were definitely
things I didn't like about it but it was
very different like I love the one shade
that um it has glitter in it and it's
like a almost like a burnt orange and it
has some glitter in it and then my video
review for it
I swatch it and I go like this and I
show the glitter and then I go and it go
like this at all the glitters gone
because the glitter is all through the
day just falls down through the day it's
not even it's not even functional but it
was really really cute you know it on
the you know in the swatch it was really
cute if you could get it to stick on
your eye it was cuter but yeah Tarte
great are
came out two years ago it seems longer
for some reason and what seems like it
was longer than two years ago
Dahlia says I'm waiting for the lorac
Pro 4 to spend more on shadows oh my
gosh lorac has been in the shadows for
like the past six months I don't even
know yeah Emily says dog man yes mr.
Ashton says I want sweet Tia all by
itself and Gator winks yeah I mean I
felt like that palette definitely had
some strong points definitely Anne says
i swatched the graveyard girl palette
last night I miss playing with it smells
like chocolate yeah it does have a
really nice scent to it I agree stuff
says I need Gator wings single yes that
thing is amazing that was the highlight
I believe that was in there it's
beautiful it's gorgeous I completely
forgot about that totally forgot about
it I have it in my natural eyeshadow
palette drawer of things that I haven't
used in a while I need to pull that back
out if nothing else just for the
highlighter in there you're absolutely
right hey Shan this is random but I
really wish tutorials would make a
comeback yeah I don't I don't feel like
cheat or girls get the views I think
that's why they're not people don't make
tutorials anymore I think because I
don't think people are watching them all
right let's go let's keep going here
these were like beauty boxes why we talk
about snack bars why don't we talk about
this I don't even know it seemed logical
at the time though oh now we're getting
them there you go that makes sense
I understand the beauty ones but and you
know what I actually was getting a
chocolate box from Amazon for a while
and then they cancelled it I was really
sad because it was fun it was a little
overpriced it was like twenty dollars or
something I didn't feel like it was
really worth twenty dollars
it was fun because you got to try like
these artisans small brands of chocolate
I really liked it but I don't know
yeah the makeup chair that's a great
tutorial channel she's really good she's
beautiful too and her production quality
Oh amazing all right let's see what's
coming out at Sephora do you remember
that okay that's really interesting
because that eyeshadow palette if you
don't remember and that Jacqueline ended
up pulling it off the shelves somehow
because people were saying that it was
terrible quality but it said in those in
there that Jacqueline only designed that
one shade and that was what she was
saying is that I didn't design she was
she said this she's like I didn't design
the rest of the shadows ever in
designing that one shade and that was
exactly what I had said before it even
launched so that goes along with what
her story was with that it was crazy
wasn't it Kida yeah it was totally crazy
um but there were quality issues with it
and she didn't want our name on it so
she pulled it it's crazy absolutely
crazy
um Kelsey says I love my little Jaclyn
hill eye palette oh my gosh I wonder if
that thing's worth anything at this
point because they all got pooled
yeah the violet December she should have
cosign on the Pat whole palette if her
name was plastered all over it oh I
totally agree I totally agree but that's
what happened but that was that was some
crazy drama Jackie wasn't it alright hop
everywhere arrest the press what's the
best
I don't know any of these products do
they still exist
can I go back in time chat with us going
back back back in time I don't know any
of these products go to drugstore

review of those of those pen liners with
the different tips they bled into my
line they were they were weird
they were super weird I did a full
review of those I don't know that either
didn't I think we haven't talked about
almay in like two years like nobody
cares about l me what is going on there
what is going on with all night from the
Disney movie finding dory Disney finding
dory makeup bags from Soho Beauty 99 I'm
a dimple right can they see us since
it's it's for its it's 46 minutes in so
let's go ahead and abandon this one well
done flora with your report you did a
nice job boring the house as far as the
products but that was not Flurry's fault
not Flurry's fault all right we're gonna
go ahead and skip over the last video
which is what's up in makeup from May
17th of 2015 May 17th of 2015 we are in
my old house our reporters this was
before tabatha came on board we had just
a few reporters we had Susan on QVC HSN
because she's a part of the original
team Lily who was one of my best friends
at the time Nicole from Erin a Nicole no
this was dannis first week Dan a-and we
had someone named Leanne that I haven't
talked to in years and Maria from agape
love girl and then beauty hall full
would one who still has Instagram I
believe I believe she's still on that
she's just not a reporter anymore but
yeah we had one two three four five six
seven people contributing which is a lot
less than normal than we have now very
interesting and this was before tad came
on so this is when I was doing the
script myself all right check this out
look at my intro like what you you might
recognize that song that's the song I
play at the end of all of my videos it
used to be my intro a long time ago I
have this weird space thing with makeup
products floating in I don't know what
that was about it
is gigantic and has packaging that
everyone is talking feel like mac has
really calmed down on their collections
they used to come out with a collection
collection collection collection
collection and I thought they've really
calmed down since then like doesn't seem
like they come out with this many
collections I think they heard the
feedback like it was just too much it
was too much but I don't remember the
wash and dry collection very well did
anybody ever get that oh sherry says I
didn't realize I watched you this long
but I remember your nail-polish in the
backyard yes I still have it it's still
over there but it's just in a different
spots it's different let's skip ahead a
little bit because it's just me
describing a collection
whoo those are pretty that was part of
the dry part Michelle loved the wash and
dry great new lipsticks Lisa remembers
my first show I bet you do again I'm
reading Lori remembers the youtubers
getting I remember that collection the
disco that one looked really cool if I
remember this was in the heart of Sigma
Sigma used to do a lot of sponsored
videos and they used to sent out a lot
of PR so Sigma was like the more fee
back then I mean they were everywhere
and then I don't know what happened they
kind of fell off the map I'm hoping they
come back because I really do like Sigma
brushes I think Sigma brushes are great
Seth says I don't remember the first
episode but I remember when the group
was formed he asked I remember that I
remember that you were there for that
maricella says what are the sales
reports for products she said you don't
hear about anymore you'd see versus
market sales would be interesting stats
yeah oh definitely think that would be
interesting I don't know if that stuff's
accessible to the public though all
right so we've got the brush cleaning
gloves I think they do still sell that
I'm blah blah blah I'm a little too long
on that one let's ship ahead who is that
oh I don't know who that is
Rumer Willis ice and Swan in tribute to
Swan Lake the contemporary fusion dance
that she danced on Dancing with the
Stars did you remember that Raven was
Raven then Rumer Willis collaborated
with colour-pop I completely forgot
about that I have no idea stuff what
happened to her I don't know Elaine says
I wish I picked up a limited edition
Sigma for small eyes collection there
you go yep
315 2015 I I can try I could try let's
go ahead and get through this and see if
we have time to do that is that a good
one
are you because I'm feeling it you're
probably telling you that for a reason
make a peak time you're cream liquid
lipsticks are those a thing I don't
remember cashmere cream liquid lipsticks
I remember the ones that were in the
flat tubes that I didn't like but
cashmere cream liquid lipsticks I don't
remember that I'm not sure remember
those
if I could only go back and tell Marlena
fix the packaging before you send it out
do you all remember that so what
happened if he weren't around them was
that Marlena released the sparklers
lection and supposedly the formula was
great but the packaging it was really
super messy and people ended up setting
them back because it was just too messy
there were all over the place so I wish
I could go back and tell her fix the
packaging they changed the packaging
whose new packaging these they'll sell
Moe's anymore I don't think they were
brand new their application they're
designed to last for 20 uses was that
exciting released or did I just say that
just keep people engaged I might have
just said that to keep people engaged
okay
let's skip ahead and see what was going
on in indie news I think in me was at
the end we even have an indie section I
didn't think we had an indie section we
didn't we didn't even have oh no here we
go yeah here we go MBA cosmetics there
is some indie stuff in here oh here we
go
I have that it's okay
a little powdery I still like MBA
cosmetic
I haven't tried their press blushes
though I tried those either I was hoping
it was a chrome elect I love the chroma
lights that's interesting I wonder if
they still sell that look how skinny my
face is - I like I probably weighed 10
pounds less than oh it was a Sephora
event before that all right so tab
wanted me to go back to what was it was
it may I want to know why tab wanted me
to find this one particular episode what
I think it was would she say up in make
up tab what was the episode you want me
to show you scroll down March 15th
2015 I got to see why because there's
got to be a reason tab wouldn't send me
there oh my gosh what is wrong with me

day I guess it might have been pi day
[Laughter]

I actually I'm fun fact I actually got
this shirt from one of my students mom's
she made them for all of the teacher she
got them printed for us for pi day they
were very into science that family and
she got all the teachers these pi day
shirts when the Eiling was all the
teachers I think it was just maybe her
kids teachers but there were a few of us
that I know got them and I still have
that shirt I wear it to bed sometimes I
don't use my work the day after pi day

what it over that's true that's still
very true that's another brand like do
we ever like we never talk about
Neutrogena it's like oh man Neutrogena

something from Rimmel let's see what
happens okay gotcha Thank You Diana
skipping ahead remember I didn't have
tab back then so this is me just going

embarrassing oh my gosh that is
hilarious
Jem was an idiot apparently oh yeah
the mini brow is listen to this yeah I
did it I didn't uh this this is yeah I'm
just I was still me back then I broke
down like like cost per ounce or ever
cost per gram whatever for each product
in there and the the Bradl pencil ooh
that was in there had like a miniscule
amount of brow pencil in there like it
was the biggest ripoff kit ever because
you paid twice as much for half as much
product you know I mean you paid like a
four you were paying for twice as much
product so it was such a ripoff and I
had totally called it out I was like hey
I'm telling all my subscribers don't buy
this as a ripoff but anyway it is 102 it
was so fun going down memory lane with
you guys really really fun you know
looking at these old episodes of what's
been makeup it's funny because I'll get
comments you know almost every week
somebody's saying oh my gosh I didn't
know this existed oh this is
so : it's like I've been doing it for
three years three years it's kind of
crazy you know but I mean YouTube the
way that they you know promote things is
is you know it's easy to miss things
because there's so many channels out
there there's so many channels and so
many beauty channels out there and you
know every it's it's very easy to get
lost but yeah I have no intentions of
stopping what's of a makeup anytime soon

lucky to work with such a wonderful team
