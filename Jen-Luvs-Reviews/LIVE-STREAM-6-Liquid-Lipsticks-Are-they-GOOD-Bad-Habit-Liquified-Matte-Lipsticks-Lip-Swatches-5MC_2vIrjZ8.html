I'll put those so you can't see the
reflection of the mess on my desk I'm
gonna show you today the upcoming bad
habit liquid lipsticks that are coming
out tomorrow these were just sent me in
PR the box is gorgeous and I asked on
Twitter I said you know do you want me
to review these things and I did a poll
and let me see the status of my poll I
haven't even looked very recently but
but most of it looks pretty positive in
the beginning let's see okay so we've
got 63% yes girl 6% no girl
31% I could go either way and the one
comment that's on here is from Astra and
she says do a live video editing just
super fresh first impression so Astra
this is for you so we're gonna I'm gonna
take off my current lipstick I'm wearing
a charmed by Ofra on my lips right now
so we're just gonna do like a quick
first impression of this if you don't
know I'm gonna be leaving for a long
vacation
for I guess it's a little over two
months we're leaving on a June 24th so I
don't really have time to do a bunch of
extra videos so this is a way that I can
get you information on an upcoming
product very very quickly so you can
decide whether this might be right for
you now this of course isn't going to be
as in-depth as I normally do but you
know it is what it is
also if you don't like live chat format
where I talk to the people that are here
I'm really sorry this is the only way
that I could get this video to you and
speaking of that I do want to say hello
to the people that made it here that
maybe can't catch me other times so
Sandra and my and Momma goonie thank you
for being here
thank you for your general awesomeness
Bobby is here my comment Queen Julie is
here in coos well oh and Jennifer and
Stacy and Lindsey and Elizabeth and
Sarah and krysta and Taylor and Emily
and the eerie fairy and crystalline Kate
and Kate and Audra thank you all so much
for being here and if I didn't say hello
to you hello to you so I'm gonna go
ahead and I'm going to remove this I've
got my my solar water ready
by the way eyes are the upcoming
look grease pallets I got an exclusive
sneak peek into the pallet that
hopefully will be the video be launched
tomorrow that's the plan but I'll kind
of show you my eyes right now but it
took some finagling to get this look so
definitely make sure you watch the video
to make sure you want to do the
finagling you know before you buy it
so let me tell you a little bit about
these very quickly the bad habit liquid
lipsticks so they're going to be six
dollars each they're available they're
gonna be available on the shop posh app
tomorrow it's they launched 614 at 10:00
a.m. Pacific on the shop hush app and
again they're going to be six dollars
each I believe let me just double check
and make sure yep or you can get twenty
eight dollars for all six they're
supposedly long wearing liquid lipsticks
and a range of flattering shades made
with the language formula let's pack
with pigmentation a feature a doe foot
applicator for precise application they
are cruelty free now one thing that's a
little bit weird which I could be wrong
on this you know I'm wrong one things
sometimes it could be wrong but they did
use ultramarine blue in these which took
all of my knowledge is not lips safe so
that makes me a little bit confused but
I could have my information wrong I
don't know that makes me a little
nervous though but the thing is is like
like I was saying with eyeshadows that
aren't eye safe you know I mean are they
really not eye safe yes for some people
so I'm definitely gonna have to get in
touch with that habit about that and
find my contact from shop cause should
ask them what the deal is with the
ultramarine blue because they are
marketing these as lipsticks so if
they're using a pigment in a way that
they're not allowed to use it then that
could be problems for them so I'm hoping
that I'm wrong on the ultramarine blue
thing we'll see other things there's
talc in here trying to see if there's
anything else you should be aware of
dimethicone if you don't like that
phenoxyethanol the preservative some
people are sensitive to but there really
isn't anything in here that's concerning
other than that but i did want to
mention it because i do think that's
quite weird alright I'm gonna go back
over to to the chat so I can see what
you guys are saying okay so wait let me
tell you what shade I've been putting on
before
let's see so this is called broken heart
in the shade right here drama queen says
is probably one of those warnings they
legally have to put on it maybe but
there's no warning on it that's that's
what's weird is there's no warning on
here at all it just says that there's
ultramarine blue in there but there's no
there's no warning anywhere on the thing
but ultramarine blue is supposedly not
it's not supposed to be lips safe but I
could be wrong again I could be wrong so
I don't want to you to hold me to that
because I mean I I mean I shouldn't find
out but all I've always said ultramarine
blue is not lips safe so I don't know
what the deal is with that and I've
never seen it in a lip product before
ever but anyway let's go ahead and
swatch these and hopefully my lips don't
fall off all right
oh it's very creamy I automatically
notice the softness of it it's very
smooth I can't imagine this drying down
it's it's so smooth pigmentation is
definitely there it looks good with this
eye look it's like a dusty lick not
dusty but it's like an orange eing burnt
orange kind of shade I really like that
on me I think that looks really nice oh
thank you drama queen for living my top
staff I hope you I'm going lightest to
darkest well I'm just going left to
right so we're hoping that it's lightest
to darkest again the shade is called
this one is called broken heart and I'm
just gonna leave this on my lips for
just a minute no stickiness and it is
starting to dry down it does look pretty
though unfortunately we're not gonna be
able to talk about where time I you know
what I'll do is I'll wear one of these
and then I'll put any notes in the video
description at the end of the day it is
going is not going to be on the shop
hush website it's going to be on the app
the shop hush app so a little tiny bit
of stickiness let's give it another
minute
and see how it goes Veronica thank you
so much for loving my informative videos
I appreciate you application was very
easy
tell you about cents while we're waiting
for this to dry down it's got a very
very slight if I really try hard to
smell it it's got a very very mild
lipstick smell it feels very smooth to
go on I wouldn't say that it's thick or
thin it just feels very smooth a tiny
tiny bit of stick to it but not much oh
thank you how she says um your eyes are
killing it I wanna have your skill eyes
grow it took me a lot to get this eye
look you'll see in the video but it did
come out pretty good I'm pretty happy
with it but it's the grease palette if
you didn't hear the grease palette from
solo look oh the artwork in the
background that is kaya Koopman are
there prints they're not the they're not
the originals are prints okay so right
now we have transfer proof yup we got a
little tiny bit of transfer if I were
you we really press a little bit of
patchiness but I could apply another
layer let's do a different shade and
let's see what happens with the next one
and maybe we'll do two layers on the
next one hmm all right so we're gonna
try to remove it and see what happens
oh that's not bad
it smells like laundry detergent this is
a brand-new a brand-new washcloth
alright let's try this one does it feel
powdery myra wants to know no it does
not feel powdery at all not powdery at
all alright let's try the next one this
one is in the shade are we collide
collide no it's not staining I don't
think it might just be the redness of my
lips I don't think it's staining though
I am NOT on the road yet sue June 24th
okay so a little patch here here will
definitely have to do two layers on here
and if this was off-camera I would
definitely be fixing my straight lines I
don't know it's not patchy really no it
looks kind of nice a little patchy let's
do a second layer and see how it goes
that change really pretty
it's very pretty remember six bucks six
box Julie says are they drying well they
do dry down they're not a comfortable
liquid lipstick I can definitely tell
you they're not hydrating in any way
because they are drying down but they
don't feel especially crackling at least
from just wearing them for a few minutes
I think I would have to wear them for
longer and again I'm going to put more
information in the video description I
wish I could do an all-day wear test for
you okay second layer looks pretty good
still a little bit patchy come on focus
on my face little tiny bit patchy but
still pretty good pretty good
I do like this color this one is again
the shade collide all right let's grab
the next one we've got four left so it
layered pretty nicely what else do you
want me to test with the next one mama
Guney says reminds me of unicorn blood
from Jeffery store I don't own that but
look how it's not smearing all over my
face like some liquid lipsticks will
smear all over on my face and this one
is not smearing and it's not super
terrible to get off either I would
imagine this one would not stain the
lips
all right this one is called centerpiece
I'm exfoliating my lips as we go and I'm
very impressed with how smooth they feel
they feel very smooth oh thank you dumb
oh I wish they were real I don't know
what lashes they are though honestly I
wish I could tell you what lashes they
are but they're not real my real lashes
are really really short okay this one's
a little more close to my natural skin
color I kind of like that they're barely
scented it sent it all they're not even
really scented at all like I have to try
to smell it in order to smell it
someone's pretty see this is one that I
would probably wear a lot look at all
this I should have brought some
concealer down that's pretty and again
this one is the shade centerpiece trying
to make sure I don't have any extra
redness that's pretty it's a little more
subtle on me it is a nice nude I agree
me yeah I feel like it goes well with
the eye look - maybe this one will be
the one that I wear the rest of the day
I like this one
Becky the NYX liquid suede stain my
whole face and I tried to wash off oh my
gosh I am NOT a fan of the NYX liquid
suede at all they are way too dry for me
they give me serious butt hole lip when
your lips end up looking like this
that's what let's look when I wear those
I don't think on line it says not lips
safe I would imagine it does not where
I'm getting the I just want to make sure
I'm clear where I'm getting that from is
from my knowledge of my knowledge of
pigments in the ultramarine blue is not
considered at least from my research
that I've done is not considered lip
safe but I do not see anything on their
website that says they are not lip safe
it does not say anything to that effect
so I could be wrong
I might be wrong on it alright the next
one is called trophy life yeah there is
no disclaimer on the website they have
not mentioned that at all that is just
me and my background knowledge talking
and I would feel bad if I didn't say
something and then it turns out they end
up getting recalled because they're not
lip safe and I knew it and I didn't say
anything reviews unfiltered you know all
right
did I say with the name of the shade
what I forgot already okay this is
trophy life ooh
all right
so if you have a lot of pigmentation to
your lips
you'd you're you may need two layers on
this because I'm seeing sorry my voice
is cracking I see that some of my lip
color is I'm not sure of its transfer
and camera is coming through just a
little bit that they would need two
layers but it is pretty and it's so
smooth I'm just I'm very surprised at
the smoothness of it how it feels going
on is extremely nice to go on so yeah I
think this would look good with the
right look I'm not digging on it with
this look but I think with the right
look it would be pretty yeah very 90
lives exactly the eerie fairy exactly oh
hi Steph I'm feeling a little bit better
I was feeling horrible when I woke up
this morning I've had a cold since
Saturday I was feeling horrible when
when I woke up but I'm feeling a little
bit better now I had some dayquil so
it's it's getting a little better all
right we've got two left the next one is
called speed dial it's kind of hard to
see the color through the tube but I do
like the design the design is really
pretty
Jessica says there's 90 shades of my jam
I know right I like 90 shades I like the
the Browns hi Lynne how are you alright
there isn't going to be at least for now
I don't think that they're gonna be on
any website to purchase like if you go
to the bad habbit website I don't think
that there's gonna be it says select
boutiques and the shop hush app tomorrow
at 10 a.m. Pacific is when they launch
all right did I say the name of this one
I'm so out of it okay a speed dial I did
say that every time I have to say it
twice because I forget 30 seconds later
whether I said it or not okay we were
this dark
I missed a little bit
that's pretty they really did a nice job
picking the shades that's one thing I
can say about bad habit they do a really
good job picking shades like shades is
like their thing you know when they when
they do palettes they can make a shade
man they can make a shade so again this
one is called speed dial and I think
it's really pretty this one seems a
little bit more opaque it seems a little
bit less um patchy than the other ones
like I feel like this one would need be
less likely to need a second layer
excuse me yeah I really like that I
really like these shades so at the end
what we'll do is I'll swatch them all on
my arm so you can see them all next to
each other I think we only have one left
and then we'll do arm swatches of all of
them see we can compare them next to
each other yeah sweater says it gets off
quite easily even the darker shades I'm
pleasantly surprised me too especially
at 6 bucks
you know because usually this kind of
performance I only get from like 18 to
$20 liquid lipsticks as far as like ease
of removal and the comfort of how it
goes on and everything oh my gosh my
lips are turning red you only got one
more though one more this one seems a
little pinky or Core more Coralie okay
this one is called mind games and it's
like either coral or pink Susan wants to
know how my lips are feeling pretty raw
pretty broad but I've felt worse I've
definitely felt worse
yeah the towel probably is making my
lips red I don't like makeup remover
wipes I'm not a fan of the chemicals and
makeup remover wipes so I don't use them
you know it's just the thing all right
for those of you that missed I know some
people in the back and that are just
coming in this the artist that's in the
background her name is kaya Koopman and
she's one of my husband a nice favorite
artist
that's pretty I was expecting it to be
more coral Hey
really nailed these colors I mean
nothing is obnoxious looking you know
what I mean like nothing was like
obnoxious
I know obnoxious for me okay my personal
opinion because I feel like some colors
are just so bright they're just like
hits you in your face
I feel like all of these are skintone
complimentary you know I have a neutral
undertone so I don't know how this would
look on different skin tones but I
really like this one too it's so pretty
oh my gosh I'm surprised I'm very
surprised so again this one is called
mind games and while this one dries
let's go ahead and do some swatches I'll
put this on my lap so I don't have to
keep turning around yeah yes it doesn't
overpower your face exactly that's
exactly what I'm talking about so we're
gonna start with I'm going to say them
as we go so broken heart will be first
toward my wrist broken heart
second one is collide yeah I mean I'm
honestly there isn't a shade in here
that I wouldn't wear then centerpiece hi
Lupe how are you my friend good to see
you I know I'm not looking to see your
answer but I hope that you're doing well
okay then fourth is going to be trophy
what ropey life trophy life the idiot
does feel dry on my lips just so you
know it does feel dry next to speed dial
because it dries down so it's gonna feel
it's gonna feel dry it's gonna be less
comfortable than one that doesn't dry
down all the way and then oh thank you
Leah and then this one is called mind
games that's the last one so I just want
to make sure I clarify with the whole
not lip safe thing I need to check with
them because I could have my facts wrong
and I don't want to give you information
and start a bunch of drama for no reason
just because I had my information wrong
because I can't imagine that their lab
would let them produce these
and have them not be lit safe but that's
just what I've always thought you know
so I don't know I don't get it
okay so those are all the swatches next
to each other so you can kind of see
them together this was that gray one I
think this one it was probably the
hardest one for me to wear but all the
rest of them I really really liked I
think they did a really nice job I think
that these could work well on lots of
skin types lots and not skin types but
lots of skin tones I think they're
beautiful I think they did a great job
so yeah so these are these will launch
on tomorrow morning let me go back and
just make sure I've got the time so
we've got June 14th at 10:00 a.m.
Pacific on the shop hush app there's a
bunch of pictures on their Instagram as
well and yeah so far I think they seem
very nice I of course I don't have a
wear test for you because I just opened
them and I just wanted to give you some
first impression swatches of everything
but I want to thank you guys so much for
being here thank you for watching I hope
you found this helpful and if you do end
up trying these let me know what you
think of them and what happened I'll let
you know what happens as far as the
ultramarine thing I will I'm gonna reach
out to them right now because I just
realized that they had the ultramarines
in them so I'm gonna reach out to them
right now
get that clarifying information in the
description as soon as I can and mad
love to you and I will see you hopefully
in a video tomorrow if not tomorrow then
on Friday for hopefully the grace pallet
review so yeah thanks so much again mad
