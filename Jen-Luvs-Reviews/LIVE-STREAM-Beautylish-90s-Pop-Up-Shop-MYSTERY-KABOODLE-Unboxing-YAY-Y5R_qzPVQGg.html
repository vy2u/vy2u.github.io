year of the day we have a little bit of
change of scenery I'm down at my
husband's desk right now we have our
little picture that my son made back
there and then Kaia Koopman back here
and some a little bit of decoration from
two-faced back that's what I use those
for as I leave those this Christmas
boxes back there because they're cute
back there but anyway at second wife she
was the day I wanted to show you I got
my Beauty Lynch mystery caboodle in the
mail and I had to open it with you
because I'm so excited and I could not
open it without you
so what they did was they did a pop-up
shop where they were selling a bunch of
like 90s products and they had a mystery
box it was $25 plus $5 for shipping so
$30 altogether and y'all know how much I
love my mystery boxes so you know it's a
surprise and I like surprises and it's
fun so I wanted to open this with you
before I open it I do want to say hello
to the people that are here make sure
everything's good I know some of you
were just here a few minutes ago
Carolina is here in AJ's here I just
responded to your snap girl friend
tortoiseshell cat is back la moon-u kita
is here and Maddie is here and Sabrina
the makeup mom what's up tam is back and
Jennifer I know right two lies in one
day I had to I couldn't wait til
tomorrow I was like maybe I can just do
it tomorrow I'm like no so I'm gonna go
ahead and start opening this because I'm
very excited very very excited if I
didn't say hello to you hello to you
welcome so this is if you don't know
I like some of you know how old I am but
I graduate high school in 1996 so the
90s was my teenage years from like 12
until 20 so or ish 12 20 ish so we've
got all these bright colors am I the
only one thinks of bright colors and
thinks of the 80s not the 90s
I don't think of bright colors in the
90s I think of like grunge and I think
of like big hair and all of that I don't
know so right here it says Beauty lush
pop-up shop and it says best decade ever
someone hand wrote that in pen
that's interesting and then there's some
stickers it says whatever as if love
yeah beauty lish 90s pop-up shop a
little set of stickers this is cute and
I think it's specifically meant to be
juvenile I think that's kind of the
point of it so you know Jamie said I
turned 13 1990 up about the same time
you got I graduate high school when you
were four Connie thanks thanks for
making me feel so old
so let's open it up and see what's in
here I've got this filler tissue paper
and then here is the caboodle oh I got a
purple one it's probably given to Lila I
don't know what is going on here I don't
get this reference is this one of them
though the chips like when you when you
flip the chips that the kids used to do
what were those things when you flip
them what were this thing's called I
wasn't into it
Mellie says she had a first child in
1996 bright colors 80s and 90s yeah yeah
woman that what was that thing with the
flicking of the things I don't know do I
ever have a break this is my break I'm
having a blast here so let me take out
my caboodle oh um gee it's an actual
caboodle and the rest is just like paper
in here so I'm gonna put this down and
let's open our caboodle hogs yes hogs
exactly is that what this is is this
appalled is that what it is oh my gosh
Nancy says it's a poem that's hilarious
I wasn't into Falls I didn't do that
okay so let's open okay this is it so 30
bucks let's see whether it was worth it
or not let's open up the top tray okay
there's nothing in the top tray we get a
mirror I mean the caboodle itself is
probably worth 20 bucks at least
and you've got a tray mirror and this
little thing and then what is this is
this a choker oh my gosh it's a choker
oh my goodness this is too funny I'm
gonna put it on just for fun I graduated
92 now I'm old you're not old summer
says my body is not ready for this
okay here we go all right let's sing you
still have a caboodle oh my gosh whereas
a caboodle still okay
hold on a minute pokeymon POG AJ says
yeah I don't know I wasn't into all
I think I was a little old at that point
because I was like in middle school we
can move there we go how do i look with
my 90s choker on we'll keep it on just
for fun okay they are in again that's
true okay and then there's three
products in here it looks like I got a
little kaboodle thing and then we got
this let's open this is these are very
small this is it okay let's see what you
guys think the caboodle is probably the
majority of the price that I paid for it
like opening presents tamagotchi I had
one of those oh my gosh it's a scrunchie
and a mood ring okay so we got a mood
ring my daughter is gonna love this it's
got a peace sign on it so what happens
is is is if you didn't know the mood
rings I had to tell my daughter this it
kind of ruined it for though that the
mood rings changed color for your mood
but it's just your body heat so there
you go it's got an adjustable little
thing here and everything and then a
scrunchie and the scrunchie has
butterfly Clips on it oh my gosh I will
use the scrunchie I will I don't have to
use the butterfly Clips maybe I'll use
them on my daughter but that's too funny
you guys see that so I've got an orange
one a pink one a yellow one and then
this rose gold one that's so funny yes
pogs there you go
so I'm gonna put this down it's already
changing colors just a little bit let's
see what's next I was hoping I was gonna
get some Sun in because I saw that they
had Sun and on this site oh I got a cold
lip smacker oh so excited even though my
kids and thanks to Nancy my kids have a
ton of lip smackers but this one is mine
not getting this one

one of those like limited time things
it's very subtle glitter though it's
just a little bit so this is definitely
gonna be nice for my kid
Mele said the son and made her hair
orange woman coughs yup rubber bracelets
did you know I'm one of my friends from
high school posted on Facebook the other
day with the rubber blade bracelets like
work inappropriate like that they meant
inappropriate things about you like how
much experience you've had like a fool
or if you did certain things like who
wore a certain color I don't think that
was at my school cuz I think I would
have known about that
that was something she was saying Anna
says are you getting the candy
collection by toothpaste
oh I got a nail polish I could feel it
it's definitely it's very grape scented
and it's just a little bit of sparkle so
that's gonna be great for my kid I could
totally tell this is the nail polish I
can feel it I'm excited
team spirit let me see this is my beauty
treats is the name of the brand here and
then we have a nail polish I know it's a
nail polish mm-hmm just the fun of this

red-hot and it's got the ring on there I
never got one of these when I was a kid
