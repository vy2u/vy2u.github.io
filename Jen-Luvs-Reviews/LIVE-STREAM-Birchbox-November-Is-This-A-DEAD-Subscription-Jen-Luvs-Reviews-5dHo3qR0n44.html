another impromptu livestream of my
Birchbox last time I seen that actually
have it's funny because I didn't think
anybody would be interested in these
unboxings but it seemed like that a lot
of you were really interested in them so
I'm gonna keep doing them as long as
there is interest if the view start
dropping down you know below way below
normal then I'll stop doing them but
until then I'll do two minute
so Birchbox I did do an unboxing of it
last month and people seem to like it
some people will just go ahead and do
another one
my schedule my filming schedule is
really messed up this week I usually
upload videos on Monday Wednesday and
Friday and the prism video took longer
than I expected the video that's
supposed to go up today is longer than
expected so I figured that this would be
a great way to get a video up today very
quickly for you and one that people seem
to be enjoying while we're waiting for
my next video my next video is another
one that either you're really gonna like
or you're really not gonna like you
because you know that's the way my truth
series is I don't know if I'm gonna call
it the truth or not or if I'm gonna call
it something else but basically we're
going to be talking about channels that
are really really good for for honest
reviews and I'm gonna highlight a bunch
of channels for you that give honest and
thorough reviews and talking about why I
feel like some people are more inclined
to not tell the truth I guess that's the
quickest way to say it I see it a little
more eloquently in the video but you'll
see you'll see um but I'm excited for it
I think that it's definitely a
controversial topic and people are gonna
get mad at me probably but I think a lot
of people are also gonna really agree
with me and what I'm saying and maybe
help you think in a different different
way about those kinds of things so
anyway it's not the video I'm working on
right now but it's not quite done I want
to make it better than what it is it's
good right now but I can make it better
so that's why it's not gonna book today
hopefully it'll go up tomorrow so anyway
I'm gonna go ahead and just say hello
very quickly to the people that got here
first so thank you so much for being
here if you're here alive Tabitha's here
of course hello my friend KJ is here and
Sameera is here
a beauty freak in the
Theresa is here also known as Teresa mo
if you look at the ending credits in the
hunters group you'll see Teresa mo she
is in the house comets and blueberries I
love that that is so cute
completely random things put together is
always adorable to me I'm sure you have
a reason we're putting them together but
that's just so cute
Sarah is here she's happy to be here and
Leslie has to go to work I'm sorry
Leslie I hope you make it on the replay
Sarah is an MVA hello in India and Megan
Torre Amanda so happy to have you all
here let's go ahead and get into the
unboxing if I didn't say hello to you
hello to you okay let me go ahead and
rip this open I have not seen any of my
squeezers for this so I don't know it's
in here
Oh before I do that I just want to let
you know I did use one of the products
from last month it's 102 I use two of
them
I used the devil serum wouldn't know
what even is this okay this is the
Clarence double serum it's very weird
okay I heard a lot of people saying that
it was awesome it says after seven days
smoother skin more radiant skin and
firmer skin it does have a lot of scent
to it I didn't look up the ingredients
for all the ingredients on the back
glycerin okay that's interesting I
should have looked at this before I
didn't lie that the ingredients were on
the back it's too hard for me to read
the price too small but anyway what
you're supposed to do this sample you're
supposed to fold it and then there's two
compartments and you squeeze without the
liquid so I did that and the scent is
very strong it does feel oily and Fira
me
I did like the way that it felt but
there's no way I'm gonna be able to see
anything from this little itty bitty
bitty sample because the scent is so
strong I would not purchase this but I
can't speak to the effectiveness of it
because you know one little teeny baby
snail isn't gonna do it but I did hear
good feedback from the community on that
so I did want to mention it I forgot to
use this I meant to use this this is
gonna go in future giveaway because I do
really like this product but I've
already tried it this is the Aiko skinny
liquid liner I didn't use this the
Clarins moisturizer I didn't use that I
didn't use the Germany and the perfume I
really like it's a lot of an elephant
I'll grapefruit on the back I love it
absolutely
so these are all gonna go and give away
I don't want to open off this little
dinky stuff I'd rather throw it in as an
extra for giveaway you know like when I
do giveaway throwing a couple extra
things I'd rather do that and use it for
a quick second and be done with it
because there's no way especially with
the skincare stuff that you can really
get a good solid review out of an entry
sample like that so I'd rather just give
it to someone that can truly enjoy it oh
my gosh biron NYX is in the house what's
up oh my gosh good to see you
I hope I'm saying your username right
Courtney is here Shannon is here I'm
everywhere Birchbox was the subscription
box oh I knew right right now it's not
the subscription box because I can't get
this stupid thing open but yeah
boxycharm I think came in and just took
over
it took a little while but they did it
alright is this thing open yet alright
this is a beautiful box that's one thing
about Birchbox that I do really like if
you have maybe you sew or something and
you need little boxes like this or you
have a reason for these little boxes
these new boxes are adorable they're
very well made they're very strong I'm
sure they cost Birchbox
a good bit for how many they have to buy
considering it's a $10 subscription
fashion babe wants to know what my
favorite subscription is and I would
definitely say that boxycharm is my
favorite I do want to disclose they have
been sending it to me for many many
years since their second box so just
want to make sure you know that but even
if they hadn't been sending it to me
it's still my favorite you get the
biggest bang for your buck and I think
about community would agree with that
okay so let's look at you see we've got
ready for the kickoff to the holidays
I'm not gonna look at that okay this is
what is in the box this is your ten
dollars you can see I mean it's just so
tiny they're like samples for ants okay
so we've got I tried this before and I
think I've tried it from from Birchbox
this is the Lord and berry black
eyeliner pencil and I remember liking
this I don't remember loving it but I
remember liking it oh you know what it's
not black it's a different color I've
tried the black this is brunette magic
brow okay let me rewind
is going a little too fast this is their
brow pencil I have never decide their
brow pencil I've tried their black
eyeliner amber wants know how much is
Boxing Club its $21 a month but honestly
I feel like it's totally worth it if you
have that $21 it also talked about
system you're in gamble cuz you never
know what you're gonna get it's
basically you know slot machine you know
you know you're gonna get something but
you don't know if you're gonna get stuff
you can actually use so it is one of
those things burn you know you have to
have to understand you may get things
that you're not really that interested
in but if you have that $21 to kind of
gamble away then I think boxycharm is
definitely the one to do so
Spidey mama wants to know about what I
think of the old Laura beauty box I
haven't gotten in the mood so I don't
have an opinion right now I should look
at some unboxings though so anyway this
is the Lord and berry brow pencil I am
going to try this because I've never
tried their brow pencil I think it's too
light is my brows are way darker than
that I don't think this one's going to
work for me that's a bummer because I
swatch it on my hand didn't look like it
was gonna be too light but I'll have to
pass this on to somebody that I know
because I don't like to swatch things
and then pass them on to people that I
don't know all right this is the Avene a
did I think I didn't say that right
hydrants intense serum and this is
probably another thing that I'm gonna
pass along there you go what's its
purpose does it say on here what its
purpose is everything is in different
languages I mean we've seen English
version is there an English version I
don't see him in English version there's
no English version oh apply morning and
evening to the face neck and neck line
alone resumes for daily skincare but it
doesn't say what it's supposed to do I
guess it's just the moisturizer I would
love to know if you've tried any of
these products if they're any good this
one's definitely gonna be building them
bonus for giveaway
okay this is the Hydra sea eye contour
gel cream by Marcel I do like Marcel as
a brand I really like their eye makeup
remover a lot my friend Shannon except
me some eye makeup you look from them
and I love it it's fantastic I haven't
used it in a minute because I've been
into my clinic take the day off but but
it's really really good so I do like it
let's see application oh it's just this
application again
doesn't tell you they need to include
more here oh wait let's just look on the
card okay look well-rested
even when you're not with this formula
which deep puffs it brightens the eye
area so that's kind of cool I might keep
this right now I'm using a different eye
cream than I'm fine it's all stained but
this this is a little more interesting
to me just a little bit Shea wants to
know what my go-to foundation is I don't
really have a go-to foundation it just
kind of depends on what I mean before
there's a lot of them that I just kind
of use you know I kind of grab four
different ones I'm more of a BB cream
kind of person so I like like a light to
medium coverage I really like my my what
the one I did for what the K to cotton
BB cream by Holika Holika that one is
awesome but there's like two shades okay
I don't know how many samples of this
I've gotten this is the Brio she over
SCARA throw dry perfection heat
protectant cream I love this stuff I'm
actually going to keep this because it's
a nice travel size so this would be
really good when I go on the travel
trips to bring this if I'm gonna be gone
for more than a weekend so I'm actually
going to keep that because I do really
love this stuff I don't like their deep
conditioner but I love their blow dry
protection key protective cream that one
is really nice okay and then finally we
have the levels natural vanilla and
charcoal soap let's see what it smells
like I'm not a bar so kind of person I
might give us my husband now it might
smell a little too girly for him
it smells like soap soap and even Noah
but I know it doesn't have a great scent
it does it's not like a sweet vanilla
it's like a plastic vanilla like almost
like if you had a toy that was a vanilla
scented that's what it smells like to me
it's like a vanilla scented toy because
it's got like a real strong curve like a
soap scent to it
know about this one I might give this
one my husband see if he wants it soothe
your soul with a sweet and smoky
sensation of one vanilla and a deep
cleanse of dark charcoal yeah I'm gonna
give this to my husband I think they
will be able to use that so do I feel
like I got my $10 worth again I'm
excited about the eye cream I'm happy to
have this this is a great product I'll
try but I guess I can't try this cause
it's the wrong color it's too light not
excited about the the moisturizer just
so I can't I don't know I it just me
personally I guess it's a neat thing and
then I'm gonna give this to my husband
so I don't know for me I guess this is
probably if I saw this on a shuffle
would I pay for this I would pay six
dollars for this on a shelf
I feel like I didn't get ripped off I
feel like for ten dollars it's a little
much it's just me though it's my fault
but it's all good I mean you know it's
it's a learning experience that's it
that's your ten bucks right there that's
that's why boxycharm I feel like is
really knocking about the part you know
Erika says the pencil alone is $10 but I
can't use it it's too light so it's $0
it's it's worth zero because I can't use
it
you know what I mean yeah Harrison Nick
says I don't think you got your money's
worth yeah I don't think I got my
money's worth either
Shane wants to know who's next to my
list it's a secret I mean I haven't
solidified anything yet I'll tell you
that I have some people that I I've
contacted one person that I've contacted
I'm waiting to hear back so wish me luck
on that and then I got some other people
that I actually I do have one solid that
I've talked to you but that's not going
to be the next one that's going to be
later but I can't tell you it's secrets
so Jeff says you can use it in the front
of your brows I might be able to maybe
it's very light though look you know
what I didn't do my brows today let's do
my brows right now hey my glasses off
let's do it
what time is it over twelve minutes in
that's okay we can do my brows real
quick and see if I can I'm getting my
camera phone out let's see oh by the way
that's not terrible you're right Jess
you and your purple hearts I think that
looks pretty good that doesn't look
terrible
I don't know it's kind of hard to tell
it's definitely not gonna work here it's
too light for there but I'll fill it in
just cuz it's not too creamy I like the
texture of it but here it doesn't look
very good it's really hard to do this in
a can with fun if you've ever tried to
do your brows in the camera phone which
I never have listen you can bow for me
this there's a reason why this doesn't
look so good but yeah I mean I guess I
think Jesse's right I think I could use
it in the front of my brows now I'm like
all uneven and stuff but I like the
texture of it yeah that's cool it feels
good oh by the way I do wanna let you
know while I've got my glasses off I am
testing the the hush palate the one
that's like subculture what is it the
retro palette I've got the retro palette
on this side and then I got the
subculture on this side and I will tell
you the quality is totally different
the I mean I'm planning on doing a full
review of it but the ease of use and the
quality is completely different but you
can get very similar looks that's the
way that I'm kind of feeling about it
right now but a full review is coming
full review is coming I should it let's
say Lucia says is very soft is it it's
not too soft it's soft but not too soft
because some of them are very soft like
where they get stuck in your brows so I
want to know if I've tried Ricky's coke
box no I haven't I but as far as brow
pencils I like ones that are that walk
that line between soft and hard I don't
I don't I like it kind of in the middle
because if it's too hard then you can't
get the product off if it's too soft
that kind of pushes into the brows
that's just the way that I feel so
anyway I should probably go stick meat
on here what's up girlfriend I need to
respond to your email I saw that it was
there but I didn't read the whole thing
because I didn't have time to properly
give you a response
I've been mighty been editing land and I
wanted to give you like a micro
attention to the response just you know
I did get
misty loves fabfitfun I think you just
have to really like the stuff it's him
that's it fun this I was the retro Matt
and Amy this is retro matte and this I
is the subculture so retro matte
subculture you see they are very similar
but when I'm gonna do a demo and a wear
test for it so you can see fully when I
do the full review
oh all right I'm gonna pop off here I
want to thank you guys so much for
watching this if you get arch box I
would love to know whether you're
enjoying it or not whether this is
something that you would be interested
in getting whether it's something that
you feel like I got ripped off I would
love to know I personally don't think
this month was worth it but I'm not
going to unsubscribe I've been with
Birchbox forever I'm totally cool with
getting some bum boxes every once a
while I'm cool with it so I hope you
guys are doing well wherever you are are
you guys I hope I don't like when people
say you guys not everybody's a guy you
know I hope that you all are doing well
wherever you are and I just realized my
hopefully my head wasn't chopped off
that entire time and I will see you guys
in live chat on Sunday and then
hopefully a video that my videos
finished by tomorrow for the the the
truth video then I hope that you guys
like so have a wonderful rest of your
