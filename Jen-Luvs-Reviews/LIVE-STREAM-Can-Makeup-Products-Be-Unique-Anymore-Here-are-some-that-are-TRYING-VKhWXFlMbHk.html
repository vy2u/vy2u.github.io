makeup chat I've been talking to myself
for the past 10 minutes I know I was
talking you I swear I thought I was
talking to you guys and I'm like going
on I'm already on the the set that what
I was about to go on to the third
product I said the intro I've been
talking to y'all what you couldn't see
me and then people are like did it start
yet and I'm like well yeah like tell
everybody tell her to go back out and
come back because it started I'm
originally an idiot I didn't realize
that the the screen wasn't moving next
to the chat because I had the visual
next to over on the side but anyway I
don't have to go into his long of an
intro now we had some issues with the
video quality last week I switched
cameras from my webcam to a new cam so
if the people in the live chat can tell
me if it starts lagging please let me
know hopefully the mic should be working
the camera should be working I can't
tell whether it works or not unless you
guys tell me it's because I it just it's
not possible like I can see the lag a
little bit but I can't tell if the mic
is working so it sounds terrible people
in the live chat please let me know but
thank you so much for being here in the
live chat we're a little bit late today
because number one I was running about
15 minutes late and number two I've been
talking to myself for 10 but we've got
coffee I went to bed at about about 3:00
last night I was on Twitter like 315
like oh my god cuz the time changed last
night and I'm like I woke up before my
own children which never happens it
looks like I fixed the camera quality
issue I'm so excited because people were
like your lighting sucks I thought my
lighting it was a it's the webcam
it's from my laptop but anyway hopefully
we're fixed now hopefully things are
good hopefully it's not lagging let's go
ahead and say hello to the collective
brain before we get into our topic which
is products that are trying really hard
to be unique are they unique are they
good
should we be buying them or are they
just a gimmick things like that
so let me go ahead and say hello to the
collective brain real quick before we
jump into these products I've got a
table full of products to show you
unfortunately I have lost the beginning
of chat where it was the people that
were here first
unfortunately they're all gone I don't
remember who was here first Banshee Muse
I know was like the third one but I know
that there were more people I went oh I
don't know who else was here but there

still moving to a new Beauty room in
your house I haven't decided yet

at Jen loves reviews and it should pop
up Emma says I have a cold and you're
taking my mind off it
oh I hope your cold gets better soon
Julie how are you good to see you okay
let's get into this topic so um I feel
like it's really hard to be unique and
makeup right now I feel like
everything's kind of been done and it's
really hard to do something that's
different that's truly truly different
and I feel like we get these things that
come in like highlighter palette she'll
remember when highlighter palettes first
started like people started really
getting into the highlighters and
they're like oh and you see you know
Nicki tutorials and she's glowing to the
gods and Jacqueline Hale and everybody's
like wow I'm freaking out of her
highlights and then we get all these
highlighter palettes and highlighter
outside and now I'm like done with
highlighter palettes and then it was
like the holographic / iridescent thing
and unicorns and all that and
everybody's are just the recent ones
there's been trends before that of
course but you know everybody's freaking
on everybody's kind of done with the
unicorn iridescent holographic thing
I've got some products here like that
but but you know do you try to be unique
and then it's not unique anymore and now
we're back to square one with trying to
do things that are unique so I've got
some products here that I feel like are
still kind of unique to the market or
they were really really unique when they
came out and now they're kind of not and
I want to talk about whether they're
gimmicky or not or whether they actually
work so the first one I wanted to talk
about was the Urban Decay anti-aging
eyeshadow primer potion I haven't seen a
lot of anti-aging makeup this is one
that I really really like this one I
tried for religiously for like three
weeks or something like that which isn't
a lot for skincare and I swear I saw a
small difference in the tautness
of my eyeshadows I'm not my shows of my
eyelids when I put my eyeshadows on
because like when I
have to do eyeliner I'll have to pull my
eye to do that sometimes when I'm using
like a fluffy blending brush it'll skip
over like my skin you know what I mean I
don't know if you know what I'm talking
about but like it'll like look like skid
marks dododo to do because my eyelids
just aren't as taut as they used to be
so I felt like this really did a nice
job with that and I haven't seen
anything before or since this now keep
in mind I've only been really into
makeup for the past like six years so
something came out before that I
probably didn't know about it but I feel
like this is really really good for for
like have any extra boost of anti-aging
I didn't look at the ingredients for
this I just remember what it did when I
use it religiously so I'm hoping that
there is legit anti-aging ingredients in
this or else I'm gonna look like a fool
but yeah it's so Aspen says so what
ingredient in that eye primer promotes
that improvement I have no idea and I
didn't look it up before I did this I
just remember that it worked for me and
plus it's the the traditional a lot of
the traditional urban decay primer
ingredients so it works really well at
least for me but if you don't like the
urban decay original primer potion
you're not gonna like this because it's
it's it's very similar to the same
formula but no I can't tell you what the
ingredient is in this and I'm gonna look
like a complete idiot if it has no
anti-aging stuff in it does it have SPF
I don't believe so
I'm a big fan of dooming SPF not in my
makeup like I like to do like you'll see
in a video coming up my Dominik
cosmetics video I'm starting to get
trying to get better with actually
putting my sunscreen in with my
foundation I find that that's kind of
the boost that I like or putting it on
before and then putting my foundation on
overtop of it that has been where I feel
like I am gonna get the best the best
results from it Aspen's like no worries
thanks for the honest answer yeah I mean
I'm uh I can't tell you what it is I
don't even know I didn't look terrible
right I you know live stream if this was
like a video I could go look at it look
it up and put it in the comments forever
maybe I'll do that later if I remember
and don't just pass out after this I'm
exhausted
alright so the next thing Oh let's see
what Ariel says she says ten
plus years applying makeup and the UD
prior potions are still my holy guild
products yeah they're amazing they're
absolutely amazing Gail says oh I never
thought of a mixing SPF into foundation
yeah it works really well for me again I
don't have like you know data tested you
know that you know it works better than
a foundation that has SPF in it but that
just makes me feel better at least as I
want to try the supergroup FBA SPF
primer I've heard that super cute makes
some really good stuff I haven't tried a
lot of super goop except for like their
regular sunscreen I haven't tried any
anything beyond like their regular
sunscreen Mimi says when did primers
become a thing I want to say it wasn't
that long before I started making videos
like six years ago but I remember
thinking I shadow primer I'd never heard
of eye shadow primer face primer before
I started making YouTube videos I'd
never heard of it so the next one I
wanted to talk about is okay let's
just-okay two-faced I know to face gets
a bad rep for you know their juvenile
marketing or their overly adult
marketing you know like we're or the mix
of the two
you know sometimes they'll have adult
themes mixed in with you know markup a
packaging that looks like it might be
for children which is very odd to me
that they do that but it seems to be
selling well and I own a heck of a lot
of it and I actually bought some stuff
on two-face website last night because
they're having a 70% off sale right now
so I got a couple of things from the
candy Johnson collection that I was
eyeballing and a couple of other things
too I put it up in my Twitter a few
carries but this I did want to talk
about because I do feel like beyond the
peach scent and all of that I feel like
this is unique to the market this is the
primed and peachy cooling matte skin
perfecting primer and what what the deal
is with this is yes it does have a very
strong scent so if you don't like cents
you're not gonna like this but one no
another thing about this is if you have
any kind of arthritis or anything where
you have trouble gripping something I
don't recommend getting this because I
do feel like I need to grip this and
then squeeze which is a little bit
tricky but if you can get it to come out
it feels very nice it's not heavily
loaded in silicones which is nice
because that's different
got a little bit of a cooling effect
when you put it on and it dries down
which is very nice and leaves the skin
feeling really nice and soft without
having that silicone slip that's like
that fake hydration feel that fake
smoothness I feel like it actually gives
a legitimate like hydration to it and I
feel like the same thing with the RX
primer that they have the hangover
primer I feel like it's the same thing
but I prefer this one for one reason and
that's because the hangover primer
it's supposed to have like a coconut
kind of scent but for me it smells a
little off like I don't know I am I'm
very anti mold like I think mold is one
of the grossest things like there's a
scene in a movie with Tom Cruise where
he's like blind like he got some surgery
on his eyes or something he's
blindfolded and he eats a moldy sandwich
I forget what movie that is but I'm like
still like horrified like you give those
movies where you like see something and
you're horrified by it and you just
can't forget that part
like that's the way that I feel about
that part of movie because anything that
smells like mold or looks like mold or
anything I just want to vomit and I feel
like that hangover primer kind of smells
a little moldy like I don't know it
smells off
I don't like it Minority Report there
you go thank you Valerie I couldn't have
pulled that out of anywhere but I can't
stand it so this one has the same
effects as the hangover primer like as
far as like the effectiveness of it the
way that it feels the way it helps my
makeup stay on longer without the funky
moldy kind of smell and I don't think of
it mine's gone bad I think that that's
just the way that it always has been I
don't think I think that's just the way
that it smells and maybe it's just my
personal taste I don't know Elaine says
there are certain cheeses where you're
meant to eat them all and I can't even
like I can't I can't even eat brie and
Bria is nothing I can't even eat it
mm-hmm
no thank you Maggie says what's a good
hydration primer I need one so bad this
one this one look for something with
capper lick and capric triglyceride
that's gonna be a good ingredient for
you also glycerine glycerine is going to
bring the moisture out of the air and
put it into your skin anything that is
lame arkad it as a humectant you want to
look
that in your Primark stay away from
anything with denatured alcohol that's
the one you really want to stay away
from if silicones are gonna kind of mask
that hydration so any dimethicone
cyclopentyl oxy and I think is a silicon
on a silicon but similar kind of
situation there there's they're slightly
different but you want to do look for
those ingredients look for glycerin and
look for especially if you're in a high
of moisture rich environment glycerin
and Caprican capitulate triglyceride
those are the ingredients you want to
keep an eye out for and they should be
pretty early on in the ingredient list
Bobby says L'Oreal has a great hydrating
primer hi Bobby
it's the Lummi one and it's so hydrating
I've heard great things about that
Allison says Smashbox primer Iser
Smashbox does a really nice job with
their primers in my opinion Cynthia says
to faith is laughing to add us all the
way to the bag because they have
cornered the teen market and danced
cheer moms I can't say you're wrong I
can't say you're wrong I can't Julie
says cover FX it makes a great primer
awesome Jen says Smashbox primer Iser
seems to be one of the few that she
seems to be one of the few that hates it
very interesting yeah I haven't tried
that one so I don't know Haley says the
smell of the factory is an acquired
smell are you talking about like the the
hangover primer maybe I can't acquire
some that smell Hey all right speaking
of Too Faced let's talk a little bit
about the peach perfect powder and
really the only thing I feel that's
innovative about this other than the
scent piece and that it actually tastes
like peaches and there's no way you
cannot get this in your mouth when you
use it because it is so finely milled
but one thing I really love about this
that I wish more brands would do and
this is why I'm bringing it up is the
top here the top is it closes here so
that when you open it up it actually um
you know it'll keep the product in there
for you and you don't have to worry
about it kind of spraying everywhere and
all over the place like I even just got
a little in my mouth just now just from
opening this I love how finely milled it
is I love the way that it makes my
makeup look this is a fantastic
fantastic powder I don't know I think
they're discontinuing some of the peach
perfect line I really hope that they
keep a lot of it around
I feel like it really was a nice a very
very nice line I think they came up with
a lot of good stuff and it was it all
hits no but I feel like a lot of it was
really genuinely very good I have a
whole video on all of the stuff I bought
from the loin melissa says it's
saccharine artificial sweetener and
that's partly what you're tasting and
there is some talk about whether the
saccharine and it will make bacterium
maybe Megan can help me with this I
don't know if she can or not but we'll
make bacteria grow more on your face
like putting sugar on your face I
haven't found any evidence to that as
far as this particular product but I've
seen that with other like sugar in
products that it was supposed to bring
bacteria to your face but I don't know
about saccharin so I need to do more
research into that but I haven't found
anything so Miss Chris says saccharin is
poison um yes if you eat a lot of it
like when you do sweet and low in your
coffee and stuff like that yes you
should not based on research you should
not be doing that Megan says bacteria
loves sugar not about not sure about
saccharin yeah and the thing is here
that you're not getting so much in your
it's not like you're eating it you know
what I mean and I don't think there is
much evidence you can totally correct me
if I'm wrong I could totally be wrong
here please look in the comments to see
if I'm wrong I will pin it if I'm wrong
I will put it in the comments if I'm
wrong but topical application is quite
different than ingesting something and
just because something I would never eat
this this would be bad to eat this would
be bad to eat so you know I wouldn't I
wouldn't put this on as a topper on my
food so Monica said Melissa says I'd be
afraid to inhale it you will be inhaling
it I mean I don't know how much research
there is behind whether
inhaling bits of this product would hurt
you long term I would dare to say
probably not Oh Ava says saccharin isn't
real sugar it does not feed bacteria
that's what I thought but yeah I mean I
think that I'm gonna talk about this
what I do my totty vitamins video there
are so many things that we can eat and
drink and breathe that can cause us harm
over time and I think that you know you
have to pick and choose your danger love
and we'll get into that more when we get
into the Tati vitamin video which I'm
hoping will be out very very soon Maggie
says is it drying not for me but I do
none of this stuff is drying for me but
I have normal skin so well normal it's
starting to lean toward a little bit dry
but mostly normal so I haven't had a
problem with that but people in the
collective brain can let me know whether
they've had a problem with that but I
have not personally but I love the
collective brain Diane says how about
the Wonder powder the ad makes it looks
so good it's good I really like the
Wonder powder I do own it it's good it's
just as good as this it's just as good
as my Laura Mercier it's just as good as
my bare minerals but is it anything
above and beyond no not to me but it's
good it's definitely a very good product
I enjoy it very much so
Jody says inhaling the pollution in the
air every day is worse than inhaling a
little powder every now and then and
that's kind of the way that I feel about
it I mean there's so much that's not
researched you know Monica says did you
see that they're coming out with
deodorant bulbs that look like AOS lip
things that's I don't like it's so stiff
it's like this my guess that would be
pretty and if it would be like I would
like that if you could like hold it like
this but if it's the same size as an EOS
no because I'm not trying to sit there
and paint my armpit forever that's not
any fun alright let's move on to the
next product
oh I brought out a couple of blushes so
let's talk about this one I wish that
more blushes were made like this this is
the Marc Jacobs Night Fever and hot
stuff air blush and I wish this this
isn't super innovative but I wish that
they made more blushes like this where
you've had two choices of color and you
can kind of use the darker side if you
want or the lighter side if you want I
know there are products like this out
there but I just wanted to show this
just because I am a big fan of this and
I won I would love to see brands do more
of this because I feel like you really
do get two blushes in one with this
where I feel like when they're in
separate compacts it's not as easy to
make the gradient go you know where I
can go in them actually this is more
than two blushes it's like three blushes
because you can get a light a dark and
then kind of in the middle here which I
really really like this is the only one
of these that I own and this was sent to
me by a subscriber actually she sent me
a different
and it broke so I went and they didn't
have that one at the store and they I
got it exchanged for this one so I'm
very thankful to have this and I really
love the shave I think people of lighter
skin tones sometimes are scared to try
blushes of a deeper skin a deeper skin a
deeper tone like this don't be afraid
even if you're very fair don't be afraid
try it and see if you like it try it
with a drugstore deeper blush if you're
you know like the NYX blush is something
like that if you're afraid to try a
shade like this but don't be afraid of
it I think sometimes people have lighter
skin tone they look at something with
it's darker and they say oh that's not
gonna work for me but it is I mean it's
a I think this is a very universal shade
for all skin tones in my opinion I don't
have all skin tones so I can type from
experience but just just from what I've
seen from watching I've been watching a
lot of women of color from all ranges
from medium to deep to make sure that
I'm as educated as possible about what
works for different people and also I
enjoy their channels but you know it's
not it's nice to know when you've got
something that'll work for a lot of
different people so I really like these
this shade in particular and I love that
format Allison said each pan has four
options I'm not sure oh here we go oMG I
don't want to keep preaching pea puree
but they launched a blush book that has
four pans and they're huge pans nice I
had mixed things happening with pure
sometimes I like their stuff sometimes I
really don't like it they do have some
good products though but I haven't got I
haven't jumped on the pure train I need
to try more kg says just use a life
light hand exactly absolutely this is
another one that's kind of interesting
I've had this for a while I did do a
full review on this it looks a little
funky now it didn't used to look that
spunky this is the Frog Prince blush by
lipstick Queen I did not like the lip
gloss at all it left glitter green
glitter behind that I was not a fan of
but I did like the lipstick and I do
like this it it's green but it turns
pink on your skin see how it's got it's
like that maulvi shade it's it's similar
and it is a more a light wash of color
so this may not work as well on deeper
skin tones because I think it might just
blend in but this will probably still
work on like a me
I'm skin tone but this is a beautiful
beautiful shade and it just gives a nice
light wash you don't have to worry about
going to clown face and it's beautiful
it's absolutely beautiful and I love the
lip product as well one thing I would
really like to try and I I'm about to
pull the trigger on it is there's a
channel I've been watching recently
called pop looks and he has a makeup
line and nikkietutorials recently tried
his highlighter that it's a black
highlighter and then when you put it on
it changes to just a beautiful
highlighter and I'm thinking about
trying it just because it is a little
bit gimmicky and then it changes colors
but it really does look beautiful on the
people that have tried it so so yeah I
mean it's similar to this but I think
that this is kind of innovative you know
not innovative I guess because color
changing products are not new
especially in lip products you know that
you've got a lip product that changes to
your pH levels or whatever which is
total badunkadunk
it's not even real it doesn't change
your peach it changes with your body
heat so and that's the same thing with
this when they tell you it changes to
your pH and it'll make give you the
perfect shade for your skin it's all
that's not true that's a lie
it just changes with your body heat it
this this product does not know your
skin tone and neither do those lip
products and it's not gonna change the
perfect color for you it's just gonna
you know mood-ring lipsticks exactly
Monica that's exactly what I'm talking
about mood rings and lipsticks mood
rings don't my daughter was heartbroken
when she found out mood rings don't
actually tell your mood I think she
found out when she was like six maybe
seven she found that they don't actually
tell your mood I didn't want to tell her
but she was like mommy I'm feeling
really stabbed and my mood ring is blue
and it says that I'm happy like girl I'm
sorry but those things don't really tell
your mood and that really put her laugh
because it was such a traumatic
experience you know what it means so
it's sorry that the tart is sorry to
burst your bubble but those things don't
change to your personal ph they just
change with your body heat so
Sara without saying it out loud just in
case there are children watching I just
had to have that conversation with my
daughter and it was very very sad moment
very very sad but I don't want to say it
out loud in case there's children
watching but adults might be able to
understand what I'm trying to say but
it's the moment in a parent's life that
you don't want to get to as long as
possible but when your kids grow up you
have to tell them certain things and I
had to unfortunately made me sad so but
anyway moving on let's see what else
does is that all four I have four cheek
products I think that's all I had for
cheek products okay
let's Oh let's move into eye shadow
stuff so these were really interesting
these kind of remind me of what's the
ones that just came out the ones with
the three pans it's got two pans and
then it's got one on the bottom they're
like thirty seven dollars
what's that brand Hank and Henry came
out with those little square things if
they were not so expensive I get why
they're expensive the I'm sure those
were insanely expensive to manufacture
with with the custom packaging and the
three I'm sure but the price on those is
insane so that's what's stopping me from
trying those I see okay I'm gonna get
golden pacifier I'm gonna get to you in
a second I'm keeping the screen on you
so that I don't miss that comment so
I've got shell and Lemon Drop these are
the ideal duo's by dose of colors and
this is the concept behind it what it is
is on the top you get a cream shadow
which I'll swatch this is shell and it
looks like this and it's like a glossy
kind of feeling it's very um lip gloss
feeling almost like a thick gloss and
then on the bottom you have a glitter
shadow so what I'm gonna do here is I'm
gonna swatch this next to it and then
I'm gonna swatch it on top actually hold
on a minute
no that's that's what I'm gonna have to
do
and I would imagine this was a really
tricky concept to get to work
unfortunately these do not work for me
but I'll tell you why okay so that is
them together so this is the one without
the base and then that's with the base
the problem is is I think that they were
trying to do the kind of creamy almost
lipgloss II so that the so that it would
stick so the glitter would stick to it
without having to use a glitter glue but
the problem is is then that leads to
creasing and with the creasing it just
looks like a hot stinking mess so what I
choose to do is I choose to either use
the top alone which seems to work for me
I'll use this and then if you can set it
with a translucent powder that seems to
work very well or I'll use just the
bottom with glitter glue but together
unfortunately for me they crease really
bad and that really bothers me I'm
really sad because you think these were
like $20 a piece something like that I
got him at IMATS last year I believe I'm
going back to IMATS this year in New
York and I'm so excited I can't tell you
who I'm gonna meet up with in New York
at IMATS but I will tell you you are
going to be very excited I'm going to
make them livestream with me there's a
couple of people I'm gonna meet and I'm
very very excited to meet them so wait
till you see I am excited and I'm gonna
hold onto IMATS as long as I can because
if for some reason my channel gets very
large I won't be allowed to go back so
I'm gonna hold on to that's one good
thing about my channel enough being here
does I can still go to IMAX so hopefully
I'll be able to go for a few more years
without not being allowed to go anymore
because when you get big you get people
coming up to you and then IMATS kicks
you out so I'm I'm really hoping that
doesn't happen I don't think I'm big
enough to have that happen and I'm kind
of hoping I can still go next year -
we'll see we'll see what happens there's
no way to know but anyway back to this I
did get these at IMATS at a discount I
think it was like 20% over something
like that and I was disappointed that I
couldn't use them together because
they're absolutely beautiful I just had
that issue with the creasing and I love
this one as well this one is lemon
it's like um let me just swatch it a
little bit for you it's really really
pretty it's a very nice base it's just
it's it's a little bit too creamy it's a
little bit too lip gloss II you know
what I mean but it is beautiful their
nicest single shadows too but you do
need to set them or else they crease
like crazy so go and pacify her I said
Jen if you willing I'd love a video on
how you mom while beauty guru
balancing both and everything it's all
about having a schedule like I have to
have a schedule and and I think dropping
down to to review videos a week has been
amazing for my sanity I was doing three
review videos a week along with the five
makeup minutes the sunday news show and
the chat it was just too much I couldn't
do it so I think that's the big thing is
just budgeting time and making sure I
still have time to go the grocery store
do the dishes do the laundry all of that
stuff it's just budgeting time but I
think a chef figured out I'm not very
big on sleep which I need to get better
at is making sure I get a good amount of
sleep because that's what always ends up
going by the wayside Sara says do you
think I Matz is is the best one to go to
I loved IMATS I love IMATS because it's
not a YouTube event it's not for
influencers it's for professional makeup
artists for the most part I mean there's
definitely a mature people I mean
there's a pro day specifically and then
there's two days that are open up to the
public and I really like IMATS I know
I'm off topic right now but I really
like IMATS because they do have
discounts where a lot of the other
events like beautycon and and Jen Beauty
like there might be some boosts that are
selling things at a discount selling
things at full price but IMATS is the
best place for like getting deals and
getting a lot of good stuff for less
expensive also exploring new brands
because there are a lot of brands at
IMATS they don't go to like the YouTube
Beauty things so it's really what you
are what your preferences are a pure
soul wants to know how much is it I
think it's $65 a day but I really like
I'm at I love it a lot I've never been
to the makeup show.allison so I don't
know about that makeup IMAX is mid mid
April
if you go to the imax website you can
get all the information about all of
their events I really like mess ok let's
talk more let's talk more about these
products so I've got more eye shadow
stuff for you so this is one that I
talked about multiple times MDA
Cosmetics is a brand that I don't think
gets nearly enough love they are an
indie brand and this is one of my
favorite formulas they have these are
the foil effects and glitters they're
called chroma lights and this is in the
shade holy grail if you like glitter
these are great you do want to put down
a glitter glue first but one thing I
like about these is they're a press
glitter so you don't have to worry about
things spilling everywhere I can go like
this and my glitter is not going
anywhere they put like some kind of like
adhering jelly stuff in there so that
when you go like this it just barely
comes look at that I mean seriously are
you kidding me and they're not very
expensive either just kind of rub that
right there but you definitely need a
glitter glue binder thank you mint candy
I appreciate you buying dirt that's the
word I was looking for but these things
are stinking gorgeous and nobody talks
about them and I think it's just because
they don't send a lot of PR it seems but
it's just they're beautiful on the lid
there are they're definitely like you
know the Stila glitters those those go
on you don't need a glitter glue these
you definitely do this will be all over
your face if you don't use a glitter
glue m.b.a does sell their own glitter
glue it works great and they're an anti
brand I'm always all about supporting
indie brands small businesses my husband
is a small business owner and I'm all
about this this is MBM as in money B as
in boy and a as in I don't know Amy no
I'm not good know things but this is
really really good Elise says how do you
like the NBA versus a steel I feel like
I need this deal adjust because it I'm a
mess the Stila will transfer for me wear
this I don't feel like transfers because
it isn't a wet formula you just put the
glitter glue where you want it and I
feel like it stays put for the most part
on my lids but I don't have hooded lids
so I can't speak to that
but the steel is I like because they're
easier you could just kind of swipe it
on and be done where this is a
multi-step thing where you got to put
the glitter glue on and then you got to
kind of pack on on what my cage is right
under the door
hope everything okay out there but you
do kind of have to pack it on after that
so this one is a little bit more work
but overall I mean oh and this one is a
little bit chunkier of a glitter where
that one's a little more fine so but but
they're both really good these are a lot
less expensive though I don't remember
how much they are but I'm pretty sure
that they're cheap as far as price point
goes but yeah I really like this stuff
and the glitter glue is good too if
you're if you're in the market for some
glare glue it's good the NICS glitter
glue is fantastic the the two-faced
glitter glue is fantastic that one's
fantastic
bancini says Mike Bravo alpha thank you
so much for being professional because
apparently oh no I don't know Mike Bravo
alpha learn something new every day
alright a couple more things another
indie brand this is a brand called
glamour doll eyes and I used to get a
bunch of stuff from them and I've talked
about that multiple times on the channel
I use they have a subscription box but
it's kind of funky of how to subscribe
to it but they make some of the most
unique eyeshadows let me show you this
one this one is called facetious I
almost forgot but it's this beautiful
purple and it's got blue like little
finely milled blue and purple and pink
glitters inside of it I'll just swatch
that for you real quick but all of their
shadows are kind of like this and if
they you use these with something like
fix+ they're insane you just put one
more swatch just to make sure I get you
the full intensity but man these things
are beautiful I don't know if this one's
still available because I've had it for
a really long time but it's just I mean
just the shift on it I feel like indie
brands do single shadows so so well and
they're very innovative compared to
what's coming out on the market from
regular you know mainstream brands I
wish what I would love to see is
eyeshadow palettes that have more unique
kinds of shades like how awesome would
it be to have an
shadow palette with a shape like this in
it why doesn't it exist I don't know but
it should so there's that one and then
like shades like this this one's called
crystal ball this is another one my
favorites it is a white but it's got
little bits of pink and silver glitter
in it very finely milled again I don't
feel like a glitter glue is necessary
with these because it's so finely milled
it just gives a beautiful shift it's
like this pink iridescent shift it kind
of reminds me of that shade that's in it
being honest Asya prism palette I want
to say the one that's like white with a
pink shift but it's done so much better
in my opinion I didn't really like the
one that was in the Anastasi oh no it's
one of the shades that I felt like was
kind of a fail but this is so beautiful
especially topped over like a base it's
really really pretty I just realize I
think that's my cat trying to get in
hold on a second let me see if I can not
unplug my microphone and let my cat in
oh it's you can you stop banging on the
door please I thought it was a cat
thank you oh my goodness it was my son
so my son banging on the door I thought
it was my cat I was gonna go get him and
bring him in if he wanted to come in
which would be weird for him because I
doesn't normally do that but it was my
son kicking in the door you know well
but anyway these I feel like are very
innovative I feel like and I guess
innovative isn't really the right word
but unique you know what I mean just
very unique cube there we go on Asajj in
Beverly Hills is cube that's exactly
what that's what I'm talking about
exactly thank you so much for that I
really appreciate that kinda new here
Melanie says have you checked out Duane
eyeshadow dawn eye I thought said Wayne
dawn eyeshadows no oh my gosh they're
multi chrome pigments and look gorgeous
about to try something next week let's
look at those Donna I I've never heard
of that there's so many indie makeup
brands I have to look at it right now I
can't even not look at it okay let's
click their best sellers see what I can
see huh that's interesting yeah they've
got one here called Merlot that's
calling to me
like a purple with a gold shift to it I
love purple and gold together and gets a
beautiful combination that works well on
so many skin tones these are pretty yeah
these really neat neat colors and then
there's one called mossy mauve it's like
a light like mauve it's a light like
pinkish kind of color and then it's got
like a blue teal shift to it see that's
what I'm talking about why can't we have
more of that why can't we have more of
that in our lives from mainstream brands
I don't understand why why I don't know
why oh my gosh a bisque Oh first time
seeing Jen live so happy to have you
here Steph says enchantress OMG I missed
that one I closed the window
Naomi PR says I feel like Andy brands
have their own trend cycle and fan
community I totally agree absolutely
Shannon says smoulder cosmetics is
awesome I don't know much about smoother
cosmetics either AJ says they're afraid
to take risk but this is the thing any
brand should be way more afraid to take
risks than mainstream brands you know
what I mean like any brands have a lot
to lose if they have a bummer launch and
nothing sells like they're out a lot of
money you know what I mean we're like
two-face has a billion dollar cushion
come on we've got a billion dollar
cushion at least something new try
something different
unicorns are you kidding me unicorns
alright anyway moving on okay um let's
see what else so okay let's move on to
lips it's 11 o'clock but I have not I
owe you guys 20 minutes so we're gonna
do 20 more minutes let's see okay so
Chris Anna here is is here from Chris
Anna and cosmetics girl
bring me some duochrome is pressed
that's what I want
duochrome is pressed I don't know it
possible that is but Chris Anna better
come bring it bring it Chris Anna Anne
but anyway these I wanted to show you
these are from ishani from total makeup
junkie 101 when I did the review of
these people were telling you this kind
of formula is very popular in India it
is a
lipstick and liquid lipstick formula
that have glitter in the background of
them I brought out latte and chai when
she released the lipsticks they were
kind of strange names and nobody really
liked at least I didn't really
understand why they were called these
kind of odd names some of them but then
we found out that the liquid lipsticks
matched up and they paired up which is
really cool but these are very different
in the u.s. market in my opinion they
have a glitter kind of put into them
like this is a brown with a purple shift
and they smell really good
like these smell like cinnamon they
smell like a chai latte I mean she
nailed the scent on these if you don't
like scented lip product you're not
gonna like them but I personally really
liked it hopefully that shift is coming
off I don't think it is coming off but
there is a little bit of a purple shift
to it let me see if I can swatch the
liquid lipstick and see if you can see
it I personally prefer the regular
lipstick to the liquid lipsticks but
liquid lipsticks are fine
yeah the shift is definitely not coming
off on the liquid lipsticks it might be
because I have it's been sitting so
maybe I need to shake it up a little bit
let me see if I can get this to show off
them yeah it doesn't look like it's got
any glitter in it anymore I think maybe
the glitter settled in it because I
don't see glitter at all anymore
that's very interesting I don't know why
it just looks like a brown lipstick now
it used to have glitter in it the lip
stick still does yeah I mean I feel like
I've always liked the lip sticks better
than the liquid lipsticks but now I like
them even more because I don't even see
glitter and the liquid lipstick anymore
because she sent me these at launch so
it's been sitting for a while well
that's a bummer I bet you all the
glitter settled to the bottom which
would be totally such a bummer but
anyway I find these to be very
innovative in the market I feel at least
in my collection I haven't seen much of
stuff like this coming out as far as
glitter like this now the glitter
doesn't hang out longer than a lip
product which I really really like it's
got a little bit of a little bit of a
rub to it when you apply it but when you
push your lips together after you put it
on you don't feel the glitter at all
it's very very friendly no glitter and I
really like these a lot I don't feel
like they come off as a glitter bomb
it's just kind of when you turn your
head you can just see like a glitter
shine you know it's not overpowering
which I personally really like and I
find that to be much more wearable so so
yeah I really like these especially the
lipstick I would say to choose the
lipstick over the liquid lipstick even
the liquid lipstick is very nice I'm
kind of bummed that the glitter is not
really working out Florence says glitter
is not edible and it's killing fish in
the ocean yes that is true there's a lot
of things we eat that aren't really
edible and as far as the glitter in the
ocean thing you are a hundred percent
right and I would definitely recommend
especially with things like this that
you wipe them off rather than washing
them down the sink whenever you have
glitter like this unless it's cosmetic
glitter that is specifically
biodegradable you want to always wipe
this stuff off and put it in the trash
it's when it goes into a landfill it's
not as harmful I mean anything going
into a landfill you don't want things
going to landfill as much as possible
but I'm watching this stuff down the
sink is really really bad so you want to
make sure whenever you've got glitter
products that you wipe them off throw
them away rather than washing them down
the sink all right um let's see
okay let's go on to the next one other
lip products so these are really neat
these are this is a brand called who is
she cosmetics and they have something
called lip composites and they're kind
of like a mix between a lip gloss and a
lipstick I think of like a really
pigmented lipstick I mean it lip gloss
really pigmented lip gloss or this thing
really cool especially if you're in the
lip brushes because I feel like with
this I'd rather use a lip brush then to
UM then to dip my finger and over and
over again you can see it just gives
this beautiful wash of color really
really like them look how pretty really
really pretty
let me do another one this one's called
the M Pyrrha and they've got some very
unique shades to this one I really like
this one's called Zen Zinaida ze nai da
and it looks like this and it's just
beautiful they're not sticky they do
have a little bit of the heaviness to
them but not like a like a lip glass or
anything like that like a mac lipglass
not as not like that
there's no stickiness to them like the
like those they're absolutely beautiful
Oh tablet says who is she named change
the name a few months ago that's right
what did they change it to tab cuz I
forget I can google it I don't I don't
have to I can I can use my own resources
who is she cosmetics that's right I
remember that now it's not coming up
what do they change it to oh my gosh
okay I'm gonna go back to check if
someone's probably already told me clean
slate thank you so much that's right
clean slate thank you holy totally
forgot about that thank you for telling
me clean slate cosmetics thank you okay
but anyway clean slate cosmetics let me
type it in make sure they still have the
lip composites okay there we go
clean slate because that would be a
shame if they stopped doing the lip
composites because I really like them a
lot lips lip composite tubes and lip
composite jars and then they have lip
towers which are really cool can you get
a ton of them yeah there we go they're
15 bucks apiece holy moly I thought they
were so expensive in the jar let me see
the tubes
okay the tubes are sixteen dollars and
then they have towers up it has nothing
in the towers right now I do have a lip
composite tower that my friend Nancy
sent me I'll show you what they look
like on I have it right here one I
thought I had it right there
where'd it go oh it's my lip glosses
doll
okay here we go this is a tower this is
a lip composite tower and these are
really fun I really like these a lot and
there's some of these cool like
iridescent kinds of ones that have like
a really fun shift to them but I do find
that lip glosses with an iridescent
shift a lot of times when you pair them
over top of a lipstick the lipstick will
overpower the iridescent and will make
it basically pointless so I really like
the iridescent ones just on the lips by
themselves or if you're just taking a
photograph to put it on take the
photograph but but I can't get them to
stay that's just me okay so the other
one that I want to show you this is more
indie stuff we got Indy Indy Indy Indy
Indy okay this is by oh man where's the
what's the name is brand oh my gosh I
can't remember you guys are gonna know I
can't believe I forgot what the brain is
ah there we go there was a Harry Potter
collection by this brand I want to say
girl lactic but I know that's not right
starts with a G but anyway this is a lip
gloss it's Felix Felicis
let me see if I can figure out what the
brand is you guys probably don't get it
before I do
let me say hold on a minute now that
storybook cosmetics no shiro cosmetics
there we go
shiro cosmetics it wasn't a wol but they
I think they still have these let me
look on the website right now they do
this one is my favorite I also have the
Polyjuice one and another one this one
is absolutely beautiful it's the full
size tube is nine dollars which I feel
like is wonderful for this let me show
you what it looks like it is so
beautiful as a topper and I do feel like
this adds such a beautiful color to
lipsticks let me kind of show you
actually I can put it over top of this
liquid lipstick by Ronnie cosmetics so
you can see the brown here there's this
one and then there's this one those are
the same shade but I'm gonna put this
over top so you can see kind of what it
does see the difference it just adds
this beautiful gold shift to it it's so
pretty
oh my gosh it's gorgeous look at that
just stop reading hopefully you can see
it but oh my gosh I love this stuff I
need to buy another one because this
one's starting to get old and I love
this and I'm like down a little bit
further than I like to be - it looks
like it's full but it's not full okay
but anyway that's another one that I
feel like is very unique to the market
and awesome okay oh here's another one
here we go we're way into the lips okay
Elizabeth says the audio is great until
you search for products oh man okay well
maybe it might be my my mic isn't
working hold on a sec let me pull this
off can you guys still hear me is it the
same or it because it my mic my audio
might be coming from something else I'm
waiting to hear can you guys hear me I
put it back on just in case okay alright
slower okay so this is working okay cool
okay so the mic is working I don't know
what happens when I walk away because it
should still work when I walk away I
don't know okay car let's put it back on
[Laughter]
all right so the next one is the Kat Von
D glimmer veil these I did not like
these were lip products and these were
just glittery craziness it was too much
it was too much it's kind of hard to see
right here but it was like glitter
glitter glitter I just didn't like the
way these looked at all at all I don't
know it looks pretty on my hand but I
didn't want like the way these looked on
my lips I thought I would like this
shade but I didn't but it's different so
we'll give him that it's different okay
here's another one indie brand I got
these at a party at generation Beauty my
friend Julia over at Julia salvia had a
party for generation Beauty and this
brand was there it's called pinky swear
and look how cute this is it is a pen
format and its then it's got like a
Stila lippy kind of thing up here it's
got like a brush tip they this is it's
like paint when it goes on let me see if
I can click a little bit up okay
yeah so it rolls up like this like a pen
but I don't like the texture of it it's
way too thick for me but if you like
thick lip products you may like it I did
not enjoy the formula but it's
definitely innovative I think they're on
the right track I think they just need
to tweak the formula because it's just
it's very pink like and I don't like it
Oh Susan asked a question that's
supposedly a good question as Kat Von D
still considered indie she seems so
mainstream now what classifies as indie
and indie brand doesn't have to do with
the size of the company it has to do
with who owns the brand show Kat Von D
owns her own branch who doesn't have a
parent company so she is still
considered indie that's all that indie
means is that it doesn't have a parent
company technically k'kaw Beauty
colour-pop and Kylie cosmetics are not
indie brands because they are all under
the same umbrella of the same brand of
the same parent company so technically
they are not indeed we are still
including them in the indie section I
think a lot of people consider them
still to be in D even though they're not
technically indie brands they have a
parent company so that's that's the
difference between MD and not indie in
case you're curious cuz a lot of people
do have that question Oh Megan says I
thought calf auntie was owned by kendo
you know what I think you might be right
Megan home tea set the home team says
Kat Von D is owned by Sephora well I am
wrong because I think you were right and
I think I am wrong who owns fan TM
Rihanna you are right and I am wrong
we've been talking about Kat Von D and
indie for a long time and I think you're
a hundred percent right LVMH owns Kat
Von D well why do we put him in indie
dead estee lauder owns so much stuff
yeah I'm an idiot
you're right totally right I'm wrong but
I'm not afraid to say I'm wrong because
you can't know everything about
everything and if you are you ever wrong
about something don't ever feel bad just
own it own your being wrong and move on
with your life cuz everybody makes
mistakes you can't know everything about
everything I feel like I should have
known that though you're right I'm wrong
all right let's move on you're totally
right okay I
more two-faced product I wanted to show
you and then I add a product so I would
love to know if there's any other
products that you all want to talk about
so this one is another two-faced product
and the only thing that made this unique
was the sense of it this is the
chocolate brownie by two-faced Ivy like
this is something that never gets talked
about and I don't understand why no one
talks about this because it's a very
good brow product and it smells like
chocolate it smells so good it reminds
me a lot of the benefit I can't remember
which one the one that has the teardrop
tip they have so many brow products the
one that has the teardrop tip it's very
very similar to that because the angle
of it so if you really small brows you
probably don't want to get this you
probably want to get one that's like a
fine point like the Anastasio one but
this one is really nice for like my
sized brows or thicker so the goof proof
thank you so much Haley I appreciate so
this is why I need the collective brain
so but yeah this thing is amazing it
goes on really really nicely I'll swatch
it for you real quick do I have a space
I'll just put it here so you can put it
on kind of light you see I didn't have
to scrub very hard or you can deepen it
up a little bit they do have a bunch of
shades though but I do really like it
gets really dark if you want it to but I
love this stuff and every time I open it
I smell chocolate which makes me
personally very very happy but those are
all the products that I brought out I do
have some other ones that I brought out
that aren't really innovative anymore
but where when they come out like the
cat Lundy alchemists palette was very
innovative and now like it seems like
everybody's doing this but I feel like
she should get some credit for coming
out with something like this at least
from my knowledge I'm sure that there
were other things like this that were
similar from some brand but this was the
first time that I saw something like
this where I did the full review on this
and what I love using this for is lip
toppers these are lips safe and I love
using them for lip toppers I love
topping them over top of an eyeshadow
look like when I've done an eye shadow
look and I'm like panis is boring I need
to spice this up I'll throw this on over
top I've seen this over black eye shadow
and it looks gorgeous over black eye
shadow Leslie says indie as an
independent yes correct
my definition of indie was correct and
just my classification of Kat Von D was
incorrect
Sabine says Jen I started watching her
channel a few months ago and you're now
my favorite oh you're one of few people
on YouTube actually takes the time to
try out parts were reviewing them yeah
and it makes me sad that more people
don't I mean that's my personal
preference so I guess I'm kind of being
selfish and then I wish that more people
did reviews there were a little more
thorough but yeah I I agree with you I'm
with you but thank you so much for
watching my channel I appreciate you
Julie says elf did a pallet like the
alchemists pallet years ago really I
missed it totally missed it by late
December says the sealer liquid gold
liquid glitter eyeshadows you have to
you used to have to hassle with a mess
and brushes to get the impact yes and I
think that's why they are pretty unique
Naomi says not selfish high standards
yeah well I don't want to impose my way
of wanting to do things on other people
you know what I mean everyone has a
right to run the channel the way that
they want Shelley says if Jen hasn't
refuted I'm not buying it oh thanks
charlie
I feel bad though because he might miss
out on some things sin in the house Cyn
I just bought the Rimmel eyeliner that
one one side is the color in the other
is metallic white for doing phase I
thought it was unique that is really
cool what a great concept yeah I don't
own that but that sounds I agree that is
very on topic choices as I'm still
trying to think of what companies can
come up with that would be new and
different I know right it's so hard it's
so hard Haley says you and Stephanie
Nicole have the most thorough reviews in
raw beauty Christie thank you so much I
love when people put Stephanie and
Christie and I in the same category it
like warms my heart because they're
they're my favorites too I love them too
very much pinky hello for us she is an
often-contributor to the what's up in
makeup face book hunters group thank you
so much for all the work you do on that
group I appreciate it thanks for you end
up their views that you put in every
time I hate to splurge on items and
regret spending my heart of money yeah
absolutely and I feel like that's kind
of our responsibility I don't see a
point in watching a review unless it's
been tested unless it's just for fun I
mean I think sometimes it's just fun to
watch certain people but what upsets me
is when we when we take to heart you
know we put it on for two seconds and
then it's like oh it's an
and then we go out and buy it and it's
like house wasn't so amazing why'd you
tell me it was amazing after put on your
face for two seconds but I've talked
about that before Christina says Jen
I've been a sub for a while and I love
makeup minute oh thank you if my husband
runs across it on my YouTube he will
literally call out make a minute that's
so cute
that's adorable I love it Oh Shirley
says we want a gentle oohs reviews
eyeshadow palette go check back in the
comments a bunch of hands are raised
lady aw I wish I could man those things
are expensive to make I looked into
formulating an eyeshadow palette was it
tablet was it like six months ago
something like that a year ago I have a
whole concept in my head for a makeup
brand it's just it's really expensive
like to make an eyeshadow palette I mean
you're looking at bare minimum ten to
fifteen thousand dollar investment bare
minimum it's a lot it's very expensive
so that is above where I can just throw
money I don't have that so maybe one day
maybe one day because I do have a really
what I think is a really cool concept
for a makeup brand maybe one day I do
have a project that's in the works I
think I have to switch labs though and
start over which makes me really sad
I've been procrastinating on switching
labs because the lab that I was gonna
work with is being a little bit weird so
I think I need to start over which makes
me sad because I was going to work on a
product that I wasn't going to tell you
what it was but I'm so I'm gonna tell
you what it is because I want it to be a
surprise but I think I have to switch
labs and start over so that means that
that's three months down the drain or
two months I think since I started that
Meghan says I need some new generalize
reviews March with an admin t-shirt that
would be cool we should do that I'm
trying to work with one brand on doing
some merch like to some little stuff I
think it would be fun just as a fun
thing to do
pinky says love you and what you stand
for on the channel fingers crossed that
one day we'll see
what's my makeup palette knowing your
standards that would be something I can
get behind
yeah and that would be the only way I
would put something out Angela says not
vitamins please no intention on
releasing vitamins that is never crossed
my mind I can tell you and especially
not now
Elise says gentle eyes reviews coffee
mugs we had some really cool designs for
coffee mugs that we put out a while ago
in case you didn't notice I ran out of
stuff to talk about so we're just
chatting now so if you were here for the
topic I'm sorry I'm going off topic
Shelley says OMG I'd love what's my
makeup merchandise we should look back
into that tab I've got a really busy
April coming up April we've got IMATS
and then right after that I am leaving
flying to my travel collab number two
which I'm very very excited about and
when I get there I'll do the same thing
I did last time with Stephanie Nicole
and we'll take a picture in front of
that person's set up and I'll put it up
on all of my other social media so it'll
be on Twitter I'll be on Instagram and
it'll be on snapchat when I get there
so you can see but that's middle of
April I'm really excited that'll be the
next Travel Club and then I have one
slated for actually I'm one slated for
May and then one slated for summer so
there's gonna be three travel collabs
between now and the end of summer I've
got three travel collabs so very excited
about that and then I'm not sure what's
gonna happen after the summer I have a
couple people I have my eye on but I
haven't asked anybody for after summer
because I want to get through a couple
more travel collabs before I ask anybody
else but very very excited gray says did
you can did you consider mentioning
Project Beauty share and Taylor yes and
actually I don't know why we haven't
covered that in what's up in makeup I
think it's because usually we scour the
the internet like traditional internet
sources for stories and I don't think
anybody's done a story on Taylor and I
think that's why we've missed mentioning
that but I think that it's definitely
worth a mention I have I've seen that
she's doing that thing with Project
Beauty share but I haven't watched the
video even though I love Taylor it's
just one of those things I just haven't
watched the video yet so I've just been
slacking on that I think that Taylor is
amazing for collaborating with them I've
heard that she's raised a lot of money
for them it's a great cause so yeah
that's definitely something I think that
we should mention at some point in the
future thank you so much for the
reminder I definitely support Taylor and
everything she does and you know I've
got her shirt that I bought from her and
you know it's just one thing it just it
slipped through the cracks and that's
that's my only excuses it's just slipped
through the cracks is mentioning
mentioning that Megan says she posted
about it somehow somehow it didn't get
into the show I don't know how what
happened there but we should put it in
that's what it comes down to we can't do
anything about the past but but we
definitely need to we should definitely
put that in somewhere even though it's
been out for a while
Abby says she loved this Stephanie Kohl
Club thank you so much and Bansi mew
says it's definitely cool making a
skincare line yes she has announced that
she is coming out with a skincare line
which is another thing we haven't talked
about in the news yet which we should we
should definitely talk about that
definitely definitely all right it is
one hour and two minutes over so I'm
gonna go ahead and pop off here and say
goodbye but I want to thank you so much
for being here this week I am slammed
with really research heavy
high-intensity videos I have three
videos that are going to be very time
consuming I've got the Totti vitamins
video which I am about half done digging
deep into the ingredients and I've
probably spent a good 10 to 15 hours
researching for that video and I'm only
about half done so in that video I want
to make sure I do a really good job on
it so I'm not gonna rush that video but
that's a video that I want to put out
this week I also have the Kristin
Dominique Lotte palette video that's
another intense one that one is half
done I've done two where tests on that
I've got the third and the conclusions
left to do but then I have to do all of
the editing I have about an hour and 45
minutes worth of footage already so it's
a lot maybe even more than that at this
point and then I also have a sponsored
video with LOX eat on that I need to get
out by Tuesday as a requirement for the
sponsored video so I'm going to be deep
in researching and everything and LOX
eat on is gonna have to take priority
because it is a sponsored video to make
sure I get that out bye
Tuesday of next week but I really want
to get these other videos out I just
need to hustle hustle hustle and focus
so I'm hoping to get those those two
videos out for you this week and then
lock seat on next Tuesday but you might
get lock seat on this week and then one
of the other videos next Tuesday it just
kind of depends I just have to get that
lock seat on video up because it is
sponsored but I'm excited to share it
with you because I've been trying they
just sent me the products I've been
trying them for a few days and there's
definitely some positives some really
really good positives but some things
you definitely need to know about them
before you buy them so I want to put
that out there but anyway now I've
rambled for an extra two minutes so I'm
gonna go thank you again so much for
being here I appreciate you and I look
like oh my gosh I look back at myself
and I'm like oh my hair my hair oh my
gosh all right I'll talk to you guys
