back from the Sephora the ID Rouge event
and I picked up the boss lady beauty
agenda this is the box for it it's as
best year ever 2018 and then on the box
it has what you get inside and I'm gonna
show you that in a second so the first
thing I want to show you oh by the way
this is gonna be a super fast livestream
I'm not gonna be chatting with the
community a lot because I've got to get
out of here my mom has a an event that
I'm going to so I need to leave but I
wanted to show you this real quick just
before I left I wasn't gonna get to do
this today and once I did it right now
so it comes with a many better than sex
mascara and also a mini melted matte
liquefied matte lipstick in the shade
sell out and I'm just gonna swatch that
really quick for you just on my hand
we'll put some testing a liquid lipstick
right now so I can't put it on right now
but if you never tried these they kind
of smell like butter it's kind of weird
they smell like butter I like melted
butter it's very odd but that's a
beautiful shade it's actually very
similar to what I'm wearing right now
which is the Rimmel the Rimmel stay
matte I'm testing today so there's that
when we rub that in to make sure that I
will mmm just do what I do okay I just
want to clarify this is not a review of
this product review of the product will
be coming later I just wanted to show
you the shades in here and what you get
since I just picked it up and this is
not available yet to the general public
it's just available to be I do rouges
today if you go to the event so this is
the palette before I show you the
palette just want to show you the inside
of the planner I did show this a little
bit on snapchat if you're not following
me on snapchat just so you know there's
some stuff on there too it's got a
little heart-shaped mirror here there's
a pocket and a place for a pen and then
inside there is a plan to keep my dog
running around and it says don't let
today your waste of makeup it's actually
a very nice high-quality feeling planner
here it feels very sturdy like something
you would get on high quality but like
something you would get at like Target
or something like that we might cost you
$20 or so for something like this 20
maybe yeah at $20 I think it's got a
pocket here and it's a zipper closure
there and then let me
the planner so inside you can put your
name in it and my favorite toothpaste
products there Rodan it on art then you
get some stickers okay look at these
stickers more sniggers I'll show you
more stickers this is going to be the
best your ever and it's got a message
from Jared Wayne do you know there and
then totally inspired by hashtag goals I
mean this is definitely very tween and
my opinion calendar and then there's
reasons to party you're so two-faced
birthdays are seriously the best ladies
who brunch break the rules and have fun
with your friends and with a look so
bubbly it'll make you feel rose' and
then it tells you how to apply it says
snow day from the it's like a look and I
love their with it's cheap soon drink
champagne with pizza in January and then
there's a to-do list and no note to self
and then I think every month has a look
this says all you need is love and
makeup and then it's not the same thing
every single month if you keep going
there is a calendar like for here it has
Jared's birthday in case you were
wondering and we've got clover
everywhere happy birthday to face you've
got little Easter Bunny hopefully has
all the holidays in here not just the
Christian ones I wonder I wonder let's
say hmm
New Year's Day let's see if they have
other holidays other than the Christian
ones I'm curious my mother is Jewish so
I'm very aware this we've got Mardi Gras
Chinese New Year Groundhog Day
Presidents Day I don't see no Rosh
Hashanah I don't think well that's
September Hornet I think hmm
I'm bad you know I'm not Jewish my
mother is was is technically Jewish but
she ain't really raised me Jewish so I'm
not really good at knowing when the
Jewish holidays are now I'm embarrassed
okay
I'm terrible left-handers day is in here
national doggie day september Labor Day
Rosh Hashanah there we go
I was right Rosh Hashanah is in here
okay good job Jared just making
or just double-checking wears something
gaudy day
so anyway I'm off topic okay I'll look
more at that later so that's the basics
of that now let's look at the pallet
this is what I really wanted to show you
so it says best year ever 2018 and then
here are the shades in sight let me get
you real close so you can see we pull it
back so you can see the whole thing in
one shot what do you notice right away
I'll show you what I notice right away
okay what do you notice
hmm we've got nikkietutorials about like
going on a little bit in here look so
you've got the purple in the green that
stood out to me right away some of the
other shades this looks then it doesn't
it look like the nikkietutorials pilot
like but more just saying just saying so
you know if you have the nikkietutorials
palate you probably have a couple B
shade let's watch these two because
these are the ones that stood out to me
right away
mystic hour and wham bam so here's a
mystic hour there's wham bam and this is
actually almost exactly the same as the
purple that's and each to face peanut
butter and jelly palette so now we're
gonna swatch unwrap me and trimmed let's
see if they're the same
nope they are not the same they are not
the same we've got a green Brown here
which I've never seen from Too Faced and
then this is more of a pink from unwrap
me didn't they look the same though they
are not the same not the same they look
the same but them yeah that makes me so
happy those swatches make me so happy
that is a green and brown I've never
seen a green brown to face am I the only
one oh my goodness that's crazy
okay so let's go back into this let me
see if there's anything else that looks
similar feel like I'm missing out on
chat let me um oops maybe switch over
and make sure I'm not missing anything
so feel like yeah it's definitely very
typical in shades but let's compare it
to last year so I have all of the Holly
from last year let's start with a
chocolate shop I keep these back here
for decoration I don't ever use these so
look Oh
there's mint chip and jingleberry oh
let's compare them side-by-side so you
can see we'll put them like this you can
see it's I mean like really really okay
hopefully you can see everything I can't
see myself right now but it's very
similar to the chocolate shop as far as
the way that it looks like it is from
the eye but let's do a little swatch in
real quick and check it and see if it
really is so let's swatch mint chip and
jingleberry mint chip and jingleberry
okay so mint chip is gonna go up here
and jingleberry is gonna go down here
and they are definitely more similar I
don't know it looks like jingleberry
looks the same as the one this year but
mint chip is it really the same as
either one this is definitely I think
you need to to face the green there but
this one looks the same as last year's
jingleberry let's do a little bit of
sugar bells
let's do glittered right here the silver
and then silver bells from last year one
has a little bit more of a brown
undertone so they are just a little bit
different but on the eye they're
probably gonna look relatively the same
okay those are the ones that stood out
to me as being like the most similar as
far as the cheap products the one in the
new one is the chocolate Soleil bronzer
it's a little bit more warm this is
chocolate Soleil here too but they look
different so let's let's watch the two
chocolate so Lay's
so on my pointer finger is going to be
the new chocolate Soleil on my
finger is the chocolate Soleil from the
chocolate shop last year oh my gosh look
at the difference that's this year
that's last year look at the difference
in pigmentation are you kidding me
I wish I had the regular one yet one is
definitely more silver Jaime this the
one from last year I believe is the more
sober one hold on a second let me just
double check no yeah the one from last
year this is the one from this year so
this is the one from this year I don't
want to mix it up and this is last year
so it's that this year's is definitely
more pigmented it has more
but yeah what's up with chocolate Soleil
what's going on there that is a huge
difference there and I promise you I
pressed the same you got to remember too
that this palettes a year old it's been
sitting here for a year I haven't used
it much but it has been sitting here a
year so maybe that's making a difference
in the formula it's definitely possible
alright let's watch the highlighters
blessed from the new one and then inner
light from last year
blessed inner light from last year they
are almost the same this year it looks
to be a little bit more pigmented just a
little bit in one okay Margaret says hi
from upstate New York hello I'm so glad
you like my channel but it does seem
like this year is just a bit more
pigmented on the highlighter just for
fun let's come on now because the
blushes aren't even close to being the
same so let's put away the chocolate
shop and let's go ahead and compare it
to meet Mary macarons this one was the
alton school sieve the one i just showed
you was exclusive so this was the all to
exclusive you can see we've got the
purple again i don't even know if i I
think I've used this one time and I just
used it once okay so you can see these
are quite different as far as the themes
this one has a lot less color in it it
looks like mint chocolate and Dec the
malls look very similar but Dec the
malls looks a little bit darker let's
try those it's this grayish one right
here Dec the malls and let's do mint
chocolate
I'm running out arm space here let's put
on the back of the hand almost identical
right there where is the palette made is
the question let's look made in China
folk made in the USA assembled and the
Dominican Republic so that's weird
limited edition to to face agenda cover
oh the agenda cover is made in China I'm
glad I clarified that the 24 I shouted
the palette is bulk made in the USA and
assembled in the dominican republic the
melted liquefied long-wear lipstick is
made in italy the better than sex
mascara is made in italy distributed
from california so there you go
just the Pat the the cover of this is
made in China so there you go oh
jazzy's here from California I'm so
happy that you're here a lot of
companies change to try to do the cost
yes but it looks like they did not that
was my mistake from the original so it
looks like these are I mean this one was
kind of boring this one actually has
some color in it so that's pretty cool
yeah I don't see let's see let's do halo
and banana cream those look kind of
similar halo
banana cream nope they're totally
different halo is definitely lighter the
pigmentation definitely seems more there
Malinda first time life thanks for being
here
Maryann's like to even try on these
holiday sets anymore it seems like the
Koala might be a little better so that's
good and then let's just look at the
last one from last year this was the
chocolate shop I believe or coffee shop
what was this thing called coffee shop I
think something like that and it came
with three pallets and these all had
different scents it does still smell a
little bit so this was the peppermint
one and it looks like we've got
sprinkles and plum pudding look very
similar so let's swatch those sprinkles
from last year plum pudding from this
year
sprinkles plum pudding nope they're
different plum pudding is more pigmented
there are sprinkles there's plum pudding
so there you go Megan wants to know if
I'm planning on buying the unicorn
holiday set from two-faced I am
considering it because it has that
melted liquefied what you call it the
unicorn tears in it that I'm really
excited about so it's definitely
possible okay so this was the eggnog
latte that came in that set let's
compare it next to each other
we've got Central Perk and trimmed the
Central Perk definitely looks more like
forest green and we know that trimmed is
a green Brown let's see what looks
similar
let's do iced coffee and I want it also
iced coffee from last year's on my
pointer finger I want it all is this
year iced coffee
I want it all I wonder all looks not
very pigmented from the swatch but again
this is not a review it's just to see
the color differences if it's worth it
based on the color shades if you own
last year's holiday collection but from
first lance's this seems to be a little
bit more pigmented
pancham you said she loves my glasses
thank you so much I appreciate it okay
so let's look again and make sure I
didn't miss anything it looks kind of
similar okay so the blushing year is
called peach cobbler let's compare that
- will you marry me okay so will you
marry me is here it's got some shimmer
to it where this one is a little more
matte a little brighter okay and this
one's the one this year is a little
pinky er this is a little more peach the
one from last year's a little more peach
this shares a little more pink okay
let's go on to the last one gingerbread
cookie from that one and let's hold it
up next to it okay it looks like maple
syrup and give me s'more give me some
more has some glitter in it mmm that's
definitely different hmm I don't only
see a whole lot of comparison here
between these two well no not really
because gimme s'more has some micro
glitter in it okay so no nothing there
looks the same to me at least from first
glance so this is the thing I feel like
even though it looks the same it looks
the same it is slightly different but
it's very similar I mean I definitely
have to try it on my eyes to see the
quality the quality seems like it's
better than last year's just from
watching um but we'll have to see I do
want to swatch just a couple more shades
because I want to see the quality of
them at least were a swatch quality I
mean I know people have been knocking
swatch quality lately I personally feel
like I can get a lot of information out
of a swatch I kind of disagree with the
whole swatches don't mean anything thing
I don't agree with that I feel like you
can get some information from a swatch
is it the best information no but you
can still get good information okay so
let's do a few I want to swatch
sleighbells
and I want to swatch give me s'more and
I want to swatch follow along and it's
Santa's helper so these are all from the
new palette these look a little bit
powdering these don't look super
pigmented especially that one that one
looks pretty weak that one was follow
along the swatch looks pretty weak yeah
I mean they look fine and there's one
more I wanted to swatch which is the
blue one called Christmas Carol so we'll
do Christmas Carol and we'll do iced out
so I'm a big fan of these frosty guys
okay so it looks like um Christmas Carol
is a navy-blue price on this someone
asked the price I think it was 59 almost
a 58 or 59 dollars I don't have the
receipt sitting right in front of you
but it was in the upper 50s or
60s we see actually I think I have my
receipt right here hold on okay so we've
got $58 $58 okay so my my first inish oh
and I also want to show next to the new
candy Johnson and Peach because the
issue I had big issue I had last year is
that the holiday stuff was very similar
to the nikkietutorials palette which had
just come out I thought that was kind of
ridiculous so I just wanted to show you
next to the new palettes the peachy
matte in case you just invested in this
you can see that it's very very
different not a lot of shade that look
even close to similar I mean there's
there's not really anything similar in
here so these are very very different
let's look at the candy Johnson palette
um let's see Oh lives here hi live from
live loves her makeup she says that Navy
isn't bad I won't be purchasing this set
but it hasn't stopped us not my
curiosity about the quality yeah and I
will be doing a full review with the
actual coffee it's hard to tell from
that from just swatching and first
impression I really want to give you a
better review of it as far as the candy
Johnson calyx I don't really see a lot
of overlap here either no they're very
very different looks like hot chocolate
and don't give a budge look kind of
similar so I'm gonna put a hot chocolate
on my finger don't give a no
they're totally different hot chocolate
don't give a
well I don't know the swatch as they
look much more similar but overall I
mean they definitely seem different than
the newest releases from the candy
collection and the peach collection so
that was a smart move um but yeah I mean
I I don't from first glance at it if
you've got the Christmas in New York
palette you may want to skip this
because it does look like there are some
similar colors but they don't look
exactly the same and that I think it's
gonna be my big message from this is
that they don't look exactly this
but it's not a super exciting palette
you know it's definitely a lot of
similar shades that they've released
before Oh dad I did did I do this one
was plum-pudding
my fingers are a mess let's put it right
here this is plum pudding I don't know
if I swatch that one that one's really
pretty but we'll see we'll see what
happened I don't know I mean and I think
that the planner if you're going to use
it is definitely going to make it more
valuable to you because I can see buying
this planner for $20 on its own so that
makes the palette 50 40 $38 and then you
get the mascara and everything with it
so if you're gonna use the planner I
think that it's it's much more worth it
but I don't think the planner on its own
is worth fifty eight dollars you're
gonna have to want to use the eyeshadow
palette as well but I do have to go my
mom is waiting for me in in Pennsylvania
she's in a cooking contest today so wish
my mom look I will let you know in the
comments under this later whether my mom
won the contest or not she's in a
mushroom contest in Pennsylvania so
we're driving the kid there but I gotta
go I hope you guys are having a
wonderful day if you're watching this
live or soon after or a wonderful
evening wherever you are if you are in a
danger zone somewhere I love you I'm
thinking about you I'm hoping that you
were okay and that everything you love
and everyone you love is okay and stay
safe out there and I will see you guys
in a video very very soon bye my friends
