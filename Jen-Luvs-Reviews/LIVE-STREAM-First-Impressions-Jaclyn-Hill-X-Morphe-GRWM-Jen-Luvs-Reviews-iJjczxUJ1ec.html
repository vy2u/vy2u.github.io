livestream I just realized my light over
here looks terrible
is that better mom how do I get good
lighting here how does this even happen
hello hello lighting what is happening
what welcome to my livestream with
terrible lighting we're gonna be looking
at the Jaclyn hill palette today it
looks like this and we really trying it
out first impressions and this is not my
typical setup obviously so the lighting
is a little bit off but we're just gonna
go with it okay we're going with it and
I'm gonna put this over here and this
will light my face so we can see what's
going on yeah so not super bro right now
we're just gonna roll with it hope
everybody is well I just got my
Jacqueline Hill palette in the mail and
I was hoping oh no stupid ads women me
to make sure my periscope friends can
still see me okay there we go um I'm on
periscope I just got my face done on
periscope I just did my foundation and
my brows and everything on periscope and
then now we're just gonna pop over here
for a minute we're gonna do the eyes and
get some first impressions and I'm gonna
pop back to periscope to finish my face
so Jaclyn hill morphe palette I am gonna
be doing a full review on the channel
probably in about a week right before I
leave for vacation so I'm going to be
leaving on the 20th to go to Iceland's I
know I told some of you that we are we
were going to Brazil we changed plans
because the tickets were just too
expensive we couldn't afford it so we're
doing Iceland instead which I'm really
excited about so yeah it's very excited
what I'm feeling right now looking at
this palette I thought that there were
more purples in here for some reason I
see this purple here but I thought there
were more purples I hate it's just
driving me crazy okay hold on a sec Oh
miss if I can turn this light on nope
that didn't work
guys aren't gonna be able to see that's
a little bit better
sorry guys like this maybe that helps a
little bit I don't know there's no way
to put like lights in front of me except
for this one here
so anyway I'm thinking I am so all over
the place and I apologize right now uh
so anyway I'm going to do like a purple
kind of look I think I'm gonna kind of
stick with this purple and go with some
of the Browns and things and do
something with it
I have heard very mixed reviews about
this but the way that I'm gonna approach
it is I am approaching it as I don't
know what this palette is I've never
heard of Jaclyn hill like I'm trying to
be completely objective on this not
taking into account anything else I've
never heard of morphine ever heard of
any of this that's that's the way I'm
kind of starting with this so we're
gonna go ahead and start with crease so
let's dip into let's see what's calling
to me let's dip into this guy right here
and I saw my friend Christie over at raw
beauty Christie she took an insert and
she glued it over top of here and taped
it over top of here I think I'm gonna
conquer her and do the exact same thing
so let's go ahead and we will oh you
know what I forgot our shadow primer
let's hold off on that for a second
let's put on a little bit of eyeshadow
primer real quick mm-hmm how's everybody
doing I haven't seen you in a livestream
in a while
hope that you were well
oh let's see Melissa likes the pallet I
think it was a good idea uh let's see
okay sorry I'm like getting in the
middle of people's conversations here
alright let's go ahead back into this
oh no Jenny's cat sick I'm sorry that's
terrible
poor cute okay anyway we're gonna go
like this
and I'm just gonna gently put it in
because I've heard it's a very pigmented
and it looks like it is and it's working
very very nicely very nice good so far
and just to give you kind of an idea of
what I'm looking for in these shadows
some of my favorite eye shadows are from
indie brands like coloured raine and
Julius place those aren't my favorite
favorite shadows so if you have those
you kind of know what I like yeah that
went on very very easily very happy with
that shape okay let's move into let's do
a little bit hmm
I'm like going back and forth between
things okay I'm gonna put a little bit
of this shade right here it's like a
sparkly Brown can you see the sparkle we
kind of put it up here and hopefully you
can know the full review you're gonna be
able to see swatches and everything but
I'm gonna put this up in my face this
one right there it's just got kind of
some silver sparkle in it we're gonna
kind of define right here as far as my
experience with morphe shadows before I
have bought the 3500 and the 3500 Matt I
did not buy just the regular 35 oh I
don't have experience with that and my
experience with those two palettes was
that they worked fine but they were not
super enjoyable for me to use I just
didn't I wasn't super impressed by them
they weren't bad palettes it just wasn't
a fun palette to use so far
I'm liking the way these are going on
the shade is not as opaque as I expected
it to be on the eyes I expected it to be
like BAM a line of brown where it's
building very nicely but it's definitely
not as you see how it's not like super
super brown but it's that's not
necessarily a bad thing because I like
being able to build the shadows up and
not necessarily have a a really dark
color off the bat so it's not
necessarily a bad thing but I am
surprised that they aren't more
pigmented based on the reviews that I've
seen make sure I'm matching here I'm
trying to wing it out just a little bit
okay what am I missing in the comments
okay it looks like some people are
having trouble with the chat if you are
go out and come back okay so so far so
good
shine light we'll put it over here so
you can actually see my face so Oh
Jocelyn is here from Lashari Joe good to
have you here um
shimmery shades with the finger with the
advice okay well we will try that we'll
see how that goes I'm gonna put a little
bit of a light shade on my brow bone
people ask me all the time about this
mirror by the way this is by a brand
called simple human you can get it at
Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond make sure you use your
coupon there for that oh yeah I forgot
people are saying there's no matte cream
shade in here well we're gonna hold off
on the brow bone then for a minute
because I want to well you know what
we're gonna try to put a little bit of
this shade right here I'm gonna put a
little bit just on the edge here yeah
that is definitely shimmery that's not
gonna work as like a brow bone blending
color hmm I don't like what I just did
but now I have to match it you never do
that where you like you start off with
something and you're like oh I don't
like it but now you have to match the
other side even though you don't like it
yeah I totally just happened to me
totally okay we're going back into the
brown because
I don't I really don't like what I just
did that did not work at all but that
was my fault I knew it was shimmery when
I went in I'm just going in and covering
that up as best as I can with the colors
I already used because that did not it
was more shimmery than I expected it to
be I was hoping it would be a little
weaker because I wanted a matte but okay
let's go back into the I'm going back
into the shade that I use in the first
for the transition and just trying to
cover up a little bit of that shimmer
that's working pretty well covering it
up it's still there just a little bit
but it's not bad okay there we go I did
not get this for PR I purchased it and
I'm one of the last people that I know
to get mine
yeah I have no connection if you've
missed the first video if you've watched
a mine I have no connection with
morphine I don't think that they know
who I am I have their sister company at
sister company but there's other people
in their family that are related to the
people at royal and langnickel I do have
a connection with them but I'm not
sponsored by them in any way I just know
them and really like the people over at
royal and langnickel okay so now that
we've got that down I feel like we've
got a nice little base let's go ahead
and go into the purple I'm thinking
about maybe doing like this purple and
like this light pink and just kind of
leaving it at that so I want to start
with a brush even though people are
saying to use a to use the fingers for
it I want to start with a brush and see
how it goes okay I think I'm gonna start
with a flat brush and we're gonna put
this just on the outer corner this
purple and see how it goes okay let's
see okay yep we've got pigmentation I
don't see shimmer though I was expecting
to see more shimmer I have color but no
shimmer
I'm scared to overreach because I don't
want my whole eye to be purple hmm
interesting
see now I'm thinking I wish I'd done a
halo but I think I went too far for a
halo okay so we'll do that off pool
party I don't think I want to use pool
party everybody use this think a pool
party I don't want to use it
that's why I'm going purple this isn't
this one's pool party if you guys don't
know I've watched a few tutorials on
this and everybody seems to love pool
party but I'm not doing it I can swatch
it for you in a minute but we're gonna
use this shade up here this pinky shade
and go into the inner corner and try to
blend it
oh thank you Jessica
puts a pool party do to me Steph wants
to know um nothing I'm just tired of
seeing it
anybody else tired of seeing pool party
well if you've watched a lot of these
reviews um I just everybody uses it so
we're gonna try something different
because I want to know what the other
shades do I have seen that one on enough
people to know that it works pretty well
okay so this is where I'm feeling with
these two particular shades the metallic
is definitely there but it's a patchy
metallic it's not an opaque metallic so
it's kind of like chunky looking where
they're certain um I can't turn any
other lights on because what's gonna
happen is it's gonna backlight me I have
no lights here on my wall and that's the
problem so I'm sorry that you feel that
it's blurry there's nothing I can do
about it I can rub the lens well maybe
my daughter's lens is dirty which is
possible but that's the best I can do
unfortunately but I am gonna be doing a
full review on this with clearer camera
and clearer everything so I do apologize
the quality isn't the best okay I also
have fine lines in my lid and I do find
that it is accentuating the fine lines
on my lid which not all shimmer shadows
do oh it is better oh good was it just
that my daughter's lens was dirty I'm
using my daughter's iPad
so it's probably it the shadows are
blending together pretty nicely but I
feel like this shade in particular is
accentuating the lines on my lid but
they're blending very effortlessly
together oh good I'm so glad it's a
little bit better thank you for telling
me it wasn't looking very good okay so
now I'm gonna use my fingertips oh don't
go into the purple a little bit and try
to bump up the shine and the opacity on
the outer corner and it's definitely not
bumping up the shine but it is bumping
up the deepness of it it's definitely
darker than it was okay now let's do a
little bit of fluffy clean brush and
we'll kind of do a little blend blend
okay well there we go and when you watch
what's it been make up this weekend cuz
I know you're gonna watch it because
you're amazing you'll be able to see the
look and better and lighting one thing I
don't like is I don't like this warm
color with these cool colors it's not my
favorite I wish that they were more
cooler like instead of all these camel
colors like all these like camel colors
I wish there were more like cooler
transitioning kinds of shades like this
Linda Hallberg palette has like this
grayish kind of color but I wish there
was something like that in here but
they're all like warm family kinds of
shades and I know that's what Jacqueline
likes but I don't know you know
everybody would make things differently
you know I mean I didn't design the
palette she did because it's what she
likes you know uh yeah hmm okay so now
what am I gonna do I feel like I need to
like do a little bit more up in the
crease kind of work so like up on my
brow bone so we're gonna go ahead and
deepen it up a little bit with one of
these matte shades let's go ahead and go
with this cool now it's too dark though
maybe this one so far I am like
the palette but I haven't used enough
shades to give a full review yet oh
there we go
that works that gives a nice nice
transition to that warmer tone they are
going on very effortlessly
it's very effortless so far I feel like
this is definitely worth the price point
because you get so many shadows and they
are going on very easily and some people
will want me to hate this palette no
matter what but that's not what I do
I don't just hate a palette just because
people want me to hate it I give you my
honest opinion and these are going on
very very easily very easily I did use a
bright color I use the purple which is
the bright the bright color that I use
this brush here is a pro crease brush by
beauty junkies I got asked what brushes
I'm using this is a Coastal Scents brush
from a kit I use all kinds of brushes
all kinds of like random brushes a lot
of Coastal Scents brushes things like
that would you say it's better quality
than the typical morphe formula I don't
know if it's better quality I would say
that I'm having more fun with it than I
did with the other palettes
um the colors seem to be going on a
little bit easier but it's been a while
since I've used a morphe palette because
like I said I didn't really have fun
using the ones that I had they were just
I have so many palettes that I enjoy
using people want me to hate it's the
same reason why people somebody asked
why would people want you to hate the
palette people want me to hate on things
that have a lot of hype things that are
created by bigger youtubers because they
want to see people I don't know they
want to they want to they want things
not to be good I don't know I don't know
but like when I did the unique video and
I didn't rip them to shreds people were
very upset with me but I didn't feel
like I should rip them to shreds for
everything I thought some of the
products were pretty good I'm just
cleaning up with a dry q-tip
okay so yeah but if you're the creator
of the palette you shouldn't have to
suggest things to use with it yes I
agree okay I'm gonna go in some natural
light I'm gonna bring you over here so
you can hopefully see what I've done so
far I do not have liner lashes on yet
compare your a 35 mm 35 s with this one
I'm gonna be doing that when I do the
full review kind of show you so this is
natural light of what I've done so far
my only complaint really so far is the
shade selection I would have made block
oh somebody already blocked the person
good okay um I would have put some
different colors in that's the only
thing I would have done differently so
far because I'm not a fan of this warm
transition that I have with this I'm
probably gonna cover it up to be honest
oh they're still here oh good block okay
do you think it's worth of money so far
so far but I mean I only use like four
shades so it's really hard yeah but I
feel I mean they went on really
effortlessly can you see the blend with
between the lighter shade in the purple
the blend came out really nicely the
blend of the darker shades was really
nice so so far I don't even know what
people are doing what in the world some
of these crazy people on YouTube how did
it even find me you put you back okay so
I know that light is annoying behind me
I kind of improve the lighting though a
little bit but so far I mean it's just
okay for me um but I want to play one
note I can't say it's just okay because
it's it's a little better than okay I
feel like they went on really easily and
there's I don't have anything negative
to say other than the color selection I
would have done differently well
actually you know what let's do a little
bit on the lower lash line while we're
here and that lighting seems to be
helping a little bit I'm gonna put a
little bit of the purple on the outer
corner down here
went really nicely and then we'll do a
little bit of let's do the pink that
pink shimmery so it just kind of matches
the upper and lower lashes
okay
all right I feel like I need to put mine
on see you guys I feel like it doesn't
look complete until I do minor so me a
little bit I know the lighting is so
weird
okay this is the new the NYX liner that
they just sent me this is the NYX epic
ink liner I've never used it before oh
wow oh I like that well that's cool
that's totally epic now it was way
easier than I thought it would the tip
is a brush tip and that was so black and
so easy
I am shocked at how much I like this
from first impression holy moly Wow
and that wing was so easy to go on
unfortunately got a little here but
that's operator error that was my fault
oh no it transferred no I'll fix it it
transferred up turn okay where's my
q-tip totally transferred to right there
and that stuff is set that is not going
anywhere
I need Bioderma Bioderma stat pyoderma
eat NYX epic ink liner where's it sold I
would imagine you can get it at Ulta and
anywhere they sell next as far as the
palette the palette is only sold on the
morphe website and in the morphe store
there we go okay
I'm just gonna add a little bit of that
shadow about going to fix that mistake I
just did no there we go
okay and we'll put on my mascara will do
L'Oreal voluminous I'll put on lashes
for for when I film but for now we'll
just put on a little bit of L'Oreal
voluminous right now is sold out but
it's supposed to restock more if he has
said that they are bringing it back as a
permanent not permanent but I was that
they are restocking it so if you did not
get it keep an eye out well what's up
and makeup we will let you know the only
makeup minute
what's up and makeup we will tell you
when it comes back in stock or when it's
coming so you can be ready speaking
about it anybody get anything from
colour-pop from their launch
I was thinking about getting some things
but then I got into doing my own stuff
okay so now we have just basic liner and
lashes on so you can kind of see that
let me take you back over to the window
Oh
Thank You tabatha tabatha submitted my
video that I put up yesterday to
BuzzFeed so I'll put a link in the video
description of that if you want to help
with that but anyway so this is how the
look came out again the only part I'm
not happy with is the brow bone shade
it's way too warm for the rest of this I
don't like the matching of it I don't
feel like the colors go together that
little line up there by my eye shadow is
from me making mistake I'm gonna fix
that I'm go this way so you can see this
eye mm-hmm this eye I think it came out
pretty good I like it I like it I like
it make a different eye look tomorrow on
camera well tomorrow I'm is my editing
day and then the show what's the makeup
to go live on Sunday so so we will see
but I'm gonna go ahead and pop off of
here uh final thoughts on first
impression again full review will be
coming in about a week I love the way
the shades went on I like the way they
blended the pink shade right here I felt
like settled into my fine lines and
accentuated them I felt like the purple
wasn't as shimmery as I thought it was
going to be but I'm not hating on it it
just wasn't as shimmery as I thought but
that's okay and let's see what else I
don't like that there's no cooler um of
these I feel like all these were warms
and I wish that there was something cool
to go with these cooler colors down here
it's almost like I feel like she had
designed all of this and then like this
corner was an afterthought and she never
redesigned the stuff up here that's kind
of the way that I feel about the color
selection I just wish there was more
cool to kind of balance that out a bit
because I don't feel like she needed all
of these you know I also wish that there
was a matte a matte cream color for like
blending out up here but performance
wise I'm
enjoying them so far definitely make
