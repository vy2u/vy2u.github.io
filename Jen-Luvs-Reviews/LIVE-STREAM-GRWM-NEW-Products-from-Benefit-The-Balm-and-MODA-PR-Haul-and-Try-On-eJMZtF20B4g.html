is being cut off Oh fine boy forgot that
hello my friends welcome to and
impromptu looking at weird things behind
me that was not there a moment ago
when I set this up there we go hello
welcome to an impromptu livestream I
thought we will play with some stuff
today I got some stuff some PR Hall
stuff and I'm very excited to try some
things out I've had the benefit one for
a little while I've just got the one for
Moda and the one from the balm and
there's a lot of brand-new stuff and
heard that thought you might be
interested in seeing how it works I
thought we just popped on here instead
of me filming a video doing ingredients
and all that stuff and take me forever
to get it to you
let's just play I have played with a lot
of this stuff already over the past few
days so I have a little bit of first
impressions to share with you as well
it's not gonna be what its first
impressions from things that I already
tried and then we're gonna try them
again today so be like second
impressions the benefi stuff that had a
little longer so I've tried that a
little bit more to give you an
impression of that stuff I went to the
benefit brow bar at Ulta and I was
talking the person that was doing my
brows and she hadn't even heard of some
of this stuff so I don't know how many
is you think that I would know but I
can't remember everything you guys know
I mean new releases there are so they'll
probably know better than I do as far as
you know what in the world is new and
what's not for benefit but I can tell
you what's new from the ball bad I feel
like I'm good at what I'm good at so
let's go ahead and get started I did use
one let's look other people in the live
chat yes hello my friends impromptu your
lives tree let me see a load my friends
were flip if you're watching this in the
weekly I'm just gonna be real quick
Ashley's here and we is here and poorly
is here hi in Ireland
hi Ashley I'm good how are you amy is
here and I love you back quarterly and
Tabitha's here and summer is here and
sahaba
is here yeah you're here she's look at
this a live stream Jessica and cats I'm
so glad you're here cat Beth and Anna is
here one of our fabulous reporters and
Jennifer and April and Sierra and Terry
Lynn
Vanessa and Talia and pinky and Diana
are to say that okay so if I didn't say
hello to you hello to you let's go ahead
and get started alright I'm going to
make sure that I'm working at the live
stream so we're gonna go ahead and start
I don't have any primer but I just put
moisturizer on my face and I don't want
to overdo it and there's a specific
reason why that's even steven foundation
by the balm last time I tried this the
only other time I tried this was I've
used my Beauty oil that I've been using
like I always use in the morning and
this broke up is really bad on my face
so I don't want to put too much on my
face for as far as primer so I did put
my moisturizer on this morning and I'm
just kind of letting it be at that and
still very much testing this so I will
keep you posted but I was not happy with
um how it mixed with that beauty oil it
had been like a good hour to since I put
it on but still like this broke up on my
face so I don't know what's happening
with that so I'm gonna go ahead and just
try this and I'm gonna use this wasn't
set to me recently but this is the Mota
face brush set they did send me a couple
of them but I think this is the exact
same size so I'm not gonna open up the
single because they are selling these
now in singles on the motor brushes
website so I'm not gonna open up the
single I can show it to you though so it
looks pretty much yeah it's the same
except for mine sturdy and this one's
clean so this one I'll go in a future
giveaway so let's go ahead and start
applying oh my gosh I've got them here
hold on hold on I'm out forgot my mirror
hopefully the light stays on oh my gosh
there's so much stuff on my table I
don't know if I have enough room for the
mirror okay so let's start with this oh
this is not gonna work
sorry guys I'm so not prepared right
this moment
okay there we go so we'll put the mirror
over here so we can see and when we're
in a good place now summer says I'm not
happy with the color selection of this
foundation boo I know they don't have a
lot of colors this one is in the shade
like me
I'm just gonna kind of blop blop blop
well it feels very very smooth to go on
it is a whipped foundation there's I
didn't look at the ingredients but feels
like they're definitely silicone in here
Natalie says what happened to the
giveaway one of the winners want to be
announced
there's no what happened to the giveaway
the giveaway is still going on
I believe that tomorrow will be one week
I think that that was one I started the
giveaway and I said it's going to be a
week so once it has been a week and
comments have slowed down to almost none
that is what I'm going to announce the
winners of the giveaway so nothing has
happened to the giveaway it's just not
over yet so this is blending very nicely
on my face I'm glad you're excited about
the Doughboy though that makes me very
happy at church so I did I just you know
when when people say comments like that
I I worry that people are thinking that
I'm not going to give stuff away which
is absolutely ridiculous I don't think
that's what you're gonna say but you
know I'm not sure that's what you're
trying to say what I'm not Shady if
you're new to my channel I'm not shaving
just you know this brush is amazing
they're so good and you um don't want to
go online you should be able to get
these at your local Walmart sometimes
they run out of stock but they've been
out for a while so I'm pretty sure
they're having a better time keeping
them and stuff but they're amazing this
foundation is definitely a good solid
medium coverage foundation I'm
definitely gonna have to keep you posted
on whether this breaks up on my face
hopefully by the end of be putting
everything on will have a little bit of
result as far as that but it is very
very soft to go on
it feels very silicone summer says the
simple human mirror is definitely worth
it get it Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond with 20%
coupon yes this mirror is amazing
totally totally agree
Leisha says she loves the brush yes
definitely AJ is here hi AJ then he says
no shade here no shade throwing your
shade card now it says thanks Jen I'm
all flustered because I just got a new
job today so I handed
where am I gonna serve that swine like
yeah I get it I totally got it you think
it's weird about this is it's so small
that you've been Steven it is 0.45 fluid
ounces so it's about half size of a
typical foundation which I think there's
a little bit Olga have he's so small but
you don't really need a whole lot either
Rach is here hey Rach why do you look
great
Oh No looks like good leadership well
great it might just be the lighting
because it's a live stream the lighting
is a little different than when I filmed
so that might be it possibly belen says
wants to know if they ship those brushes
internationally I honestly don't know
you'll have to go to the the motor
brushes website and see if they do not
know I'm sorry that they sent it says
royal brush UK Ltd so it looks like
you'd be able to get them in the UK at
least which i think is where you are you
can always app them this is their PR
stuff
so you can do motor brush comm at motor
brush at all those places are hash tag
hash tag modem avens is probably me but
you I'm sure you can find out the
foundation AJ is the even-steven
foundation now we also I also got the
sexy mama translucent powder and I meant
to look this up I kept getting
distracted of whether this is a setting
powder or a finishing powder
it says anti-shine translucent powder
with tiny oil absorbing spheres so
because it's oil absorbing I'm assuming
it's a setting powder so I'm just gonna
use it as a setting powder and I
apologize I'm you know what I don't feel
comfortable doing that I'm gonna look it
up really quickly bomb sexy mama because
I need to know I can't just use this
without knowing Shirley says I'm new I
want to enter the giveaway how do I do
that you go to it is international to
give away there's a giveaway video on my
channel you should go there and watch
the video find something you want to win
and leave that in the comments okay
let's go to the balmes website
it just says translucent powder
let's say I don't want to use it long it
says powder your face without a trace
the sexy formula is revelers with every
bit of it River it doesn't say it says
the same thing soft matte finish so I'm
just going to use it as a setting powder
and I'm going to use some of the new
motor brushes let's see where that
there's the eye brush set they have a
bunch of the new prismatic line that
they sent oh my gosh it's so beautiful
of course I so last bag they come with
these little cute little holographic
bags they're hollow they're hollow and
this is the brush that you would use
with it at least this is what motor
recommends it's good buffer brush this
set comes with a bigger fan brush and
then a mini fan brush the mini fan brush
is supposed to be for like highlighting
your nose or contour your nose or like
your Cupid's bow and stuff I have this
in the regular motor brushes and I love
it so let's go ahead and apply the sexy
mama I'm not going to use concealer
today because I don't have any brand new
concealer and I'm not feeling like I
super need it right the second Beauty CJ
says I have trouble problems with pores
you are not alone this brush is a little
bit bendy so it's nice it's not really
packing super well but you don't
necessarily want like super packed with
a brush like this because you don't want
to take face it's a tad bit puffier than
I expected but it's not painful but it's
not quite as soft as I'm used to from
later but it's great it's good it's nice
but if I go like this and I brush it
like this it's very soft it's only if I
jam it into my face I can feel a slight
bit of coconut justice like that and it
set the foundation or really nicely okay
so let's put that to the side anyone
else getting weird up with a white with
colored bristles and you know what the
first thing I said to the people at will
and langnickel when I saw these I was
like it's gonna believe but these these
colors are gonna bleed they don't I've
washed these brushes so many times like
the the brightly colored ones for Moda
and like these I've watched them lots of
times think the color does not
yeah Jenny says life's too short for
pokey brushes I know it's just there
it's slightly slightly pokey these are
mini mix wants to know what brushes are
these these are by Mota you can go to
motor brushes comm they send me a lot of
brushes I really really like their
brushes this is probably the least well
I mean it's only if you really like jab
yourself in the face you can feel it
just a little bit and like in the little
sensitive areas Amanda said they totally
don't run they're amazing yeah I agree I
agree Heidi says first a beauty fat
coconut primer as a gift of the Gods
good to know wait to know where Beauty
FX says royal has great brushes totally
agree totally okay so let's go into
brows with four into this benefit stuff
now the new newer things that I got from
them that I want to show you was this 3d
brown tones and then the brow Zing's I
also had a lot of stuff from benefit for
their brows up so really love it this is
my favorite thing this is the goof proof
brow pencil I would love this brow
pencil so much it is definitely my
favorite and the reason why I like it is
because I have a little bit larger brows
and the smaller brow pencils at the
Askia brow Wiz and at the L'Oreal one
they're really really tiny and fine or
this one I can just swipe a lot easier
because it's a little bit thicker so if
you have a little bit thicker brows you
can kind of get a little more in there
Joe says that is one thing I really need
is some good brushes especially eye
brushes I have some eye brushes I'm
going to show you when we get to the the
bomb's eyeshadow so the tip that I got
from the good chick at the benefit brow
bar is to start at the bottom because
I'm not a good brow person and then work
your way up from the bottom so that's
what I've been trying to do it.we and I
feel that looks so much better when we
want to try to draw on the hairs is what
she said
and I'm finding it for me when I spray
them out I ain't taking off too much
product and it doesn't look as good
Bailey says I love the boot proof nice
the mascara is amazing
what mascara which one where are we at
let's get those brows on fleek surely
says and then Laura says I love that
pencil yeah this one is definitely my
fave they also have a nice range of
shades too similar to Anasazi a
different but similar to Anasazi where I
feel like like mix and mix and rich
quality L'Oreal don't have as many shade
but they're listening how much range at
the L'Oreal unreal Isaac adult life
because the shade that I have is too
dark it just looks weird
like I wore it in what's it been makeup
this past week and I feel like it um my
brows are just too dark they look too
heavy they look low they just didn't
look good so I don't think I want to use
that one anymore just because of the
shade alright so the next thing I'm
going to use is the 3d brow tones
now I have to say I can't really tell
what the world is happening with this
the brown tones is supposed to give you
like a highlighted brow effect but I
can't see it I can't see it well we have
a spammer swimmer report report you
spammer all right so you have to tell me
if you can tell but for me I don't see
anything with this I don't know what's
going on like it's just me but do you
see anything maybe it's because my brows
are so dark but I can't see anything
it's supposed to give you like a
highlight and make your brows look like
more 3d subtle brow and he had some
highlights yeah reflects a teal yeah I
can't I can't really see anything but
that's it's supposed to be subtle but I
do like that it kind of combs through my
brows and adds a little bit more color
but I don't really see a big like
highlighting effect I'm gonna bring that
down a bit that actually looked really
good and then it's got this weird little
like pokey thing on the top from
knocking things off if you can see that
right here there's like this little yeah
AJ doesn't see it either yeah I don't
see anything either but I'm gonna oh
there we go now
see it a little bit if you can see a
little bit of shine on my brow just a
tiny bit it almost makes it gives it
kind of a wet look and I like that
little pokey thing I had ever used that
before Jabba says never fear the wrench
wrenches are here
that's the little code name that we
made-out Tabitha made up I think for
people that are the admins not admins
their Facebook modder is that is totally
working I have never used the end before
and I can definitely see a little more
of a shine I don't know if you can see
it now very little shine CJ says oh I
see why art says I paint those spikes at
the end
I don't know I'm starting to like them
but damson I don't understand why
anymore watch Johnny eyebrows well I
kind of like them I like them so much
less thing is the brows things I wish
that they had used half the half the
product for half the price because this
this color is way too light for me
there's no way I've used this one this
is a brow wax and one thing I like about
this little kit is it comes with this
foldable brush that's super super cute
like that and it's got two sides it's
got a rounded side and it's got a sharp
side and then it's got the brow wax it
also comes with little mini tweezers so
I really like that I have to tell you
though that the brow wax I feel like
sometimes will remove whatever brow
product that I have so that I don't like
but I am going to use this to kind of
start it up the bottom on my brows and
try to get unruly kind of do a little
better with my brows I've gotten
probably the most comments about my
brows that I don't know how to do my
brows when I'm working on it and I'm
getting better and then own a makeup
artist
it does feel waxy to go on I don't like
putting it all over though because I
feel like it takes off the rest of my
product so I kind of figured out a way
to work with it it's definitely not my
favorite product from benefit for brows
but I do like it so all I did was I just
kind of outlined the bottom a little bit
let me see what I need to outline the
I think I'm gonna leave the top alone I
feel like I don't want to overdo it
Joanna said finally caught you like and
Julie's here hi Julie
so the other thing is is if you don't
lay these in here to like properly it
won't flow so you just have to make sure
you lay them in there properly it is a
flip closure I've shaved number four for
this by the way and also shake number
four for this one so that's it for the
benefit stuff I wanted to show you oh I
did bring this over I'll show you anyway
well there's two things I'll show you
that I did I'm not going to use today
but this is the corral this is actually
one of my favorite things from benefit
as well if you like the austalia
dip brown but it's too much this is kind
of a more subtle version of that you do
get a lot less product which kind of
stinks but I like this product better
than the dipbrow because it's not as
scary for me and then this one is the
brow bone conditioning primer honestly I
don't like this
I don't see any benefit for this for my
brow in that weird al' see any benefit
its benefit but I don't see any real
benefit for this for my brow it's like
this gel that comes out and I haven't
seen it really doing anything since
apply my least favorite product but if I
was gonna recommend anything from
benefit it would be this and this these
two and if you want to try something fun
you can try this but just expect that
it's very very subtle and the browsing
this is kind of in the middle kind of in
the middle whoever says help me try to
clear brow mascara
yes and I honestly like the Anasazi and
one I cannot stand I really don't like
that what I'll tell you what because it
makes my brows crispy and it smells like
straight-up
alcohol I do not like it at all you
almost got one I know a lot of people do
love it and if you love it that's great
and I'm so glad you love it but I don't
like that my friend she says I'm so
excited I was just too begun to do
swatches of the Sephora pro pellets glad
to be able to hang out with you in the
background oh that's awesome so glad
you're here hey man how are you good to
see you my Marinella
let me sure Marinella says and the
cosmetic brand is called benefit when
the product doesn't have a benefit I
know a guy
all right so let's move on let's do our
shadow did I bring our show
/ I did not so let me go grab an auto
this is one I haven't used in a minute
this is a good one though if you happen
to see this especially on HauteLook this
is by Mira Ness in this beautiful
packaging and it's one of those that
mutes out discoloration in your lids so
I really like that a lot especially if
you don't want to do like dark shape
tape something like that I don't find
this to crease like I do with the Tarte
shake tape on my lids you have people do
that whole you know the Tarte shaped
tape and um and they use that for for
like doing cut crease and stuff like
that I feel like you could use this for
a similar purpose I don't think it needs
out discoloration as much as that
concealer but it also doesn't crease up
so if you happen to see this on
HauteLook I definitely recommend I don't
know about for full price shipping it's
really pricey but for like half off on
HauteLook
it's a guess okay now Oh roasted the
Rose Bowl
Rose rose Alba I'm gonna say rose Alba
hi Jenna I'm trying to stay as long as
possible because I work at work oh my
goodness no get caught don't get in
trouble okay so now I need your input
because I want to know what you guys
want to see so for eyeshadow we can play
with the meat mounted or we can play
with the nude nude beach or we can play
with it in the palm of your hands I also
have the brand new smoke bomb palette
this is what it looks like on the inside
so what do you what do you all want to
see whatever you want to see is what
I'll use we kind of show you what's
going on here so this is the smoke bomb
we can play with that then meet Matt
adore Jessica from yes it does the fit
beauties here I forgot to mention in my
last live chat that she's another
channel that I watch a lot this is the
meet Matt adore nude beat your smoke
bomb of your hand
nude nude smokebomb nude beach palm of
your hand nude beach this is the bomb of
your hands it looks like a lot of palm
of your hands
nude beach nude beach palm of your hands
okay and then this is the nude beach
nude beach palm of your hand smoke bomb
oh man it's like a split no rachel says
your collection has been good quality
pair daughters have it on oh good I
worry about that meet my dad or mom of
your hands on the door oh gosh now if
not I've got everything okay so this is
what we'll do why don't we play in all
of them let's do a little swatching so
let's watch in the balm of your hand
real quick so this is Matri four neat
matrimony we've got new dude it's called
firm then we have Alice copper from a
rock star palette and then we have Matt
Russo from meet Matador so we're gonna
do a little swatching hmm we definitely
seem a little bit blue that think it's
launched they're going let's try not
Russo again but nothing it looks like
good this bill doesn't look so good hmm
okay well let's point Mary Lewis in
there I'm just wiping on my pants
there's Mary Lou and then we'll do this
is Mary Lou Bahama Mama down boy
frat boy these are definitely more
subtle kinds of shades they're not super
pigmented hopefully they build and then
the last one is the instinct in I don't
know this is insane which in this team
is this houndstooth
which is a really good one so that's the
hole in the ball of your hand cap
palette Oh get back to work rowdy be
have a good day so no down boys a great
name so there's that whole pallet I'm a
little nervous especially about the meat
matrimony one in that Reed
seems like it's very light this might be
a good more like more for people that
like more subtle looks from the works
cool kinds of looks hmm okay we did that
let's go into let's just do swatches so
let's go into the smoke bomb swatches so
this is striking and then luminous and
then smoke it will do these on the back
of the hand here were the spoiled one so
pretty oh this one is action - that's
the luminous one okay second swatch
looks better so I guess it it's
buildable and then this one looks kind
of like Mary we've done them a little
bit it's not quite as peachy it's a
little more champagne even very low and
then let's do
we're just swatch them all because I
think this is important did you mean
Facebook written group name is what's up
in makeup I'm going to swatch the new
Beach right now will go on the other arm
I'm not used to swatch them with my
other hand so hopefully it's okay so
we're gonna do brilliance babe buff
bright brilliant baby bump right fine
those look good they look a little
better know if you can see because I'm
likes watching very terrible okay and
then we have Brainiac brave people mr.
law do it so you can see bringing me up
well there is the brush built through
that one feels really coiled and bold
built feels amazing
so that's Brainiac raised built
bone that built has me feeling a certain
kind of way
oh yes Nadine I am wearing foundation
I'm wearing the new the ball one
the even-steven one and then for more we
have Bo delicious breathtaking and that
one kids go to bootylicious and reason
so this is BA delicious maybe ba
delicious breathtaking bootylicious
little more thumbs the spoils and brazen
so that's the whole nude beach it
definitely has a beachy feel it's got
that warmth to it where you don't really
see that with the balm too much alright
and now we'll do we have one more goji
the meat Matador and we'll do that hmm
we'll do that on this side even though
it's a little hairy over here Oh lovely
to be hi Jen big hugs to you xoxox of
you to carolina having my coffee and
watching Jen yay
net meet Matador so it looks like this
and we'll go Matt Russo Matt Barnard
that Munoz and Matt Jones just watch

away from all the hair hmm not really
showing up so well hmm
okay let's try again Matt Russo Matt
Renard Matt minos Matt Jones that Matt
munis one not so much soil well maybe
it'll be different on the islands I
don't know Mon love Beauty says funny
story halfway through self-tanning my
nozzle broke just now oh no all right
let's go into these Matt Williams and
that Johansson Matt Soto met borsky this
this field this one feels like the
pretty vulgar one where it's got with a
little bit of grit to it which is kinda
weird
why why me spec see what's going on okay
alright so there's those those are a
little bit better maybe not so sure
about this and then that lead is the
last one it's a flat so this one looks a
little bit patchy but it may be
different on the eyes who knows I
haven't tried this one on my eyes yet I
did try the nude beach on my eyes but I
haven't tried this in my eyes yet all
right hopefully you guys can see those
swatches okay I think you can all right
now that I'm all switched up let's put
some on our eyes let's go ahead and
break out this is the motor brushes this

one I had for a while and then this is
the new this is the one that they just
sent me so we've got all these oh my
gosh aren't they beautiful can't even I
can't even with these and I use these
almost every single day they're so good
we've got just a variety of different
things so this set comes with a smoky
eye brush a smudger brush a crease brush
and then an angled eyeliner brush and
then these come with the angled eye
blender the shader and the domed shadow
and then a brow brush so those are those
so these are two different sets I know
you can get them at the motor brushes
website I'm not sure if they're at
Walmart yet hopefully they will be soon
so let's go ahead and let's just do a
little mix of all the different palettes
so we can see some things I'm not sure
the cost I didn't
yes they did
okay so the smokey eye kid is $14.99 and
the prismatic bold eye kid is $14.99 so
the eye brush sets are 49 each and they
do come with the case and the full set
of these is $24.99 the individual
brushes 14.99 and smaller one this one
here is $9.99 meet the ones with yes
the radiance kit which is the face one
does these three with the case this is
1999 so yes and then there's another
bass face hit this one right here that
one says 1999 - oh my goodness we have a
deluxe gift set for fifty dollars that
would be a really nice Christmas or
Hanukkah or whatever you celebrate gift
or birthday gift you celebrate birthdays
or just then I love you gift if you
don't celebrate anything there are some
people they don't celebrate anything
need help doing the outer V for outer D
were
I recommend brushes like this this one
for blending and for poking it into the
outer corner something debts like this
one these are really good Sarah says
I've never used mud I brush this before
I love their face first brushes anyone
have a commute they're all awesome
honestly they're all very good
especially for the price they're so
cheap okay let's go ahead and get
started with this eye look I know I'm
taking forever to do this let's do more
you have here okay let's do the smoke
bomb and then we'll fill in with some of
the other palettes so I'm gonna go ahead
and start with this one this is the
shader brush and I'm gonna go into
luminous this did not swatch very well
but it's picking up really nicely on the
brush so let's see how it goes yeah it's
definitely going on to the eyes better
than it was swatching I try to get a
little closer so you can see much better
we've not swatch very well at all
that went on really smoothly still
though very lights and it's not a super
bright color on me just gonna go in just
a little bit heavier okay now let's go
in with a little meat mat a door I think
nope let's go in with right this one
right here there we go
yes Sarah wants to know if this will go
live afterward yes what it does is it
renders to youtube so it takes about 15
minutes or so to show up on YouTube but
it will be there in full I'm just gonna
take that shade and bring it a little
bit above my crease just to give a
little more color so it's nice and
pretty oops I used the wrong shape darn
I don't like these jeans very much so
rubbing a little bit of eyeshadow on I
should get a towel all right and then
I'm gonna go in with let's see if I can
grab something from Matador yeah so
we're gonna go with Matt and Johansson
to kind of blend it out a little bit on
the top these are all going on super
smooth not tacky at all
which makes me happy because the swatch
is whirling catching its dip in any bag
for the other eye just cuz that's haha
your reaction to the meet Matador nope
slams palette not doing it for me but
it's but it's blending on the eyes much
better than it was all right let's do a
little bit uh hmm this is where the
choice is made for the lid color because
that's where I can really see on my eyes
let's do um let's do breathtaking all
over the lid and then we'll do a little
bit of striking from the ball from the
smoke smoke palette from this one we'll
do a little bit of this one in the outer
corner
marinella says like true artist makeup
lovers love to rub stuff on their
clothes oh right how weird is that I'm
just gonna use the mirror in here it's
got a little bit of a peak shift to it I
was not expecting that that is like fire
oh I missed a little bit Oh get that
down there shadow get back down here
maybe they'll look closer so you can see
that the world one there we go all right
now I'm going to use a little bit of
this one and I'm gonna pop that one over
on the outer corner
oh they're new oils formula come to mama
I love it I like it I love fluid shadows
oh my gosh nothing beats a good foiled
shadow for me I know I have a towel like
somewhere here I should be using it I'm
just gonna take this and blend it just a
little bit okay that looks nice okay so
now I want to just deepen off the outer
corner just a little bit more those are
not calling to me okay let's use I don't
know if this is dark enough the
bootylicious is gonna be dark enough
maybe like I'm gonna mix these two
bootylicious and brazen and I'm gonna
use that stamp brush this one right here
this is the mode a smoky eye brush and
I'm just going to go back and forth
between these a little bit and then just
stamp that me outer corner on both sides
and then I'm gonna take a clean lucky
one we'll take this one this is the
angle with a blender brush and just kind
of blend that up a little bit
oh that was effortless that look took
two seconds okay done oh by the way this
is hashtag not sponsored they're not
paying me for this video they just sent
me this stuff yes soon if it was
sponsored I would have told you anything
I just so do you Mike
Bailey wants to know if the color drain
cleaner parts car is worth the hype yes
yes it is it's amazing it's one of my
faves of okay Stevie whose cost neutral
we want to know what I use the condition
my brushes I don't is that bad
I don't condition my friend let's go
ahead and do a little bit of brightening
in the inner corner let's go back into
smokebomb we're gonna use this guy right
here you know we haven't using the bum
of your hand yet and it's real eyes so
pretty let's be in the bum of your hand
what can we use in here use a little bit
of bronzer use a little bit of a Hama
mama I was a particulate when I try to
bronze myself I don't know why I insist
on doing it when I know I look
ridiculous when I try well you know
we're among friends here we can try new
things right then so put a little bit
here not necessarily for contour but
kind of contouring a little bit with a
high conflict
so we don't end up with too much velvet
Smith says I used to in one shampoo to
clean my brushes it works great
yes yeah I use baby shampoo I have an
organic baby shampoo that I use on the
Sun and I just you send me that I got
like a multi pack like I think it's is
it honest I think it's by an honest
company I got like a multi pack at
Costco it was like two big huge bottles
of it and you don't have a whole lot of
hair so use that all right that's cute I
like it I like it
okay what's the lower lash line let's do
a little bit from this for lower lash
line I'm going to use this one this is
the angled eyeliner brush I'm going to
use Alice popper this is from the rock
star palette and I'm gonna put that down
and then we'll view a little bit of this
shape firm this is from the new Jude
palette and I'm gonna put that down I
really like to kind of contour my lower
lash line I like to do a little bit
darker and the outer half and then
lighter and a half I just like the way
that it looks okay let's move on to
eyeliner I have I've used this before
this is the swing by the bone it is a
one of those liquid liners that you dip
but it is very pointy like a pen liner
so it's a nice little hybrid of a pen
liner with a like dip and traditional
liquid liner so I really like swing a
lot it is very easy to go on it's very
very black it dries down to like the
leathery almost finish
and it does not seep into my fine lines
too badly it is a little tiny bit I
don't know if you can see that it is
seeping in just a little bit last time
we use this I think I had less finalized
than I do now I don't think I'm gonna do
a wing because I can't do a wing one
hands in but Kathy says hello from Irish
caffeine Brooklyn hello Irish Kathy Pat
says you were all genu any makeup look
good oh thanks I try really hard Disney
Princesses Jenna how many makeup how
many brushes roughly do own I love
brushes too many I did a brush declutter
where I got rid of a good 50 brushes but
I probably have at least 50 to 75 a lot
I love my brushes it's too much I know
all right so is seeping into my fine
lines just a little bit so I am going to
use a brush to get rid of that and fix
that you go into this angled brush this
is the brow brush and I'm just going to
take this and I'm going to go run it
gently over top of the liquid liner and
it kind of smoothes and smokes it out
but it doesn't it's not um it's not
smudging it it's just making it so that
it doesn't look like it's seeping into
my fine lines you see that and that
works really really well because I
always have like the liners seeping into
my fine line so that works there we go
but we're not going to go away today I
can't do it one-handed
all right oh Matina is here hi yeah
hello to you and Julio down by the
schoolyard I did see your comment by the
way about how many times can you enter
the giveaway one but Julio can enter
once and you can enter once and that's
fine
Barbara says those Wayne Goss brushes
are expensive I know stephanie nicole
has those and she does tons of videos
eventually she gives a good way to take
care and watch them yeah
I'm sure she does I don't know if I have
a seen a video by Stephanie specifically
about the Wayne Goss brushes but I know
she uses them a lot I don't have many of
them I got some MVP which lucky bags but
I've never purchased any outright the
new benefit brow powder this one is the
one that I have this is the brow Zing's
this is a brow wax box of goodies and a
lot of these are gonna go into get clay
because I already owned them but I
didn't have a brow powder so I don't
know oh you know what we could use this
is the high brow brow pencil I'm going
to open this one yet
it's open this one you can use this one
too it's gonna be a long treat you know
I think you've gone way ok
there we go let's do a little Brown
highlighting and it needs a set it's
brand new to me
highbrow well like that that's so pretty
that worked really well how convenient
then I just found out I'm glad you asked
about the brown powder because I've
never look looks really nice just a nice
little subtle it's got a little bit of a
pink tint to it so just be aware of that
but I think it looks really pretty I
like that
Mandy says I watch technical entire
baby's video on care of brushes when I
got my Wayne Goss brushes and I followed
on my natural hair brushes nice Michelle
says Levi is waving at you hi Levi
Disney Princess they're promoting a new
benefit brow powder at Michael's store
oh nice
Monica says I love watching you and I
work at Sephora until until Lots Oh lots
of people about me thank you for that
thank you so much that's nice of you
okay so let's do a little bit the see
where we have here we need to do mascara
let's try the scuba mascara this is the
bomb scuba mascara it's good new it's
relatively new it's their waterproof
mascara I think it came out beginning a
summer crystal says how do you get your
family to leave you alone when you film
they don't always if you saw my last
live chat my my daughter is on at a
playdate and my son is watching a movie
that he's never seen before so he's very
engrossed in his movie and I fed him
before I thought oh and I didn't get the
big deal with him is making sure he's
well fed before I get on alright that
first the first difficut did absolutely
nothing
come on scoop up pull through for me and
I'm getting a little bit of length it's
not fluffy then I'm getting like zero
volume
I'm definitely getting late okay there
we go it's a very natural looking lash
it's definitely not thick and clumpy
what am I getting length whoa the length
is coming not volume so if you have a
lot of lashes that they're short this
one's gonna be for you
I have no laughs very few lashes and
they're very short so let me see if I
can get close see if you can see let me
go how let's scroll up a little bit so I
can see what I'm doing so hopefully you
can see so that's with and then that's
nothing
let me see how I did
wait Horniman it's on like a 30-second
delay
oh you can't really see there we go you
can see it when I close my eye okay let
me do again and then this is nothing
okay let me do another coat we'll do one
more coat so this would be coat number
three see if we can go up a little bit
of volume this is really nice I am
surprised because I'm very picky about
my mascara the only thing I wish is I
don't mind if it's a little clumpy as
long as it gives me some volume but
we're not we're just getting a law a law
a lot of length and of course I can't
speak to the the waterproofness because
I just put it on but let's get one more
look so this is three coats and then
this is nothing
so hopefully that gives you an idea of
how this looks let's scroll down and see
it people are saying will I be doing
check-ins on this makeup today I wasn't
planning on it um Jim Dancing fan says I
look like a corpse
thanks it was not the look I was going
for but good to know because hopefully
it'll be fixed soon whoops look is
definitely not what I was going for
another thing about the mascara about my
steer in general is I feel like once you
like in order to truly test a mascara
you need to have it open for at least a
month and try it because I feel like as
a mascara gets older sometimes the
formula changes it dries out a little
bit and the formula will change see this
I feel like I'm getting more volume I
wish that my lashes on both sides were
exactly the same I really feel like
they're not I can't really test a mess
they're on one side and then the other
because I feel like my lashes aren't the
same on both sides because it's like I
must have more lashes on this side
because I'm getting more volume but it's
really pretty I'm very surprised what I
can do is later on in the day maybe I'll
make some notes in the description about
how everything wore you or you know oh I
have a better idea I'll check in I'll do
check-ins on Instagram and snapchat so
follow me over there and we'll check in
with it I really like this and I'm picky
about not my mascara this is the scuba
water resistant black mascara by the
phone I do really like it is it giving
me false lashes no but no no mascara
give you false lashes it doesn't feel
particularly heavy it doesn't feel like
it's clumpy we're good or though we'll
do a close-up of both sides
okay so we'll check in on Instagram and
snapchat through the day let's go ahead
and let's do lips because my lips are
driving me bonkers and apparently I look
like a corpse so these are all the new
shapes to me from the balm I don't own
any of these so we have romantic
we have adoring we have faithful
reliable and charismatic so reliable is
the one that is automatically calling to
me it's like my thing all love men men
Makita I can't say it in a Spanish
accent but she says she likes my nails
thank you so much I just painted them
yesterday and they're already chipping a
little bit this is reliable we'll try
this color and it looks like doodoo
they'll take it off and do something
different thank you so much smells like
mint chocolate chip ice cream just so
you know
Wow
get it together Jen get it together when
people tell me not to smack my lips
together when I do liquid lipsticks but
my issue there is that's how I get the
formula to look smooth so that's what I
do and I know that not everybody agrees
with that application method but you
know I'm a firm believer and doing what
works for you and that's what works for
me I like that color
that's a me color right there that's a
me color that one looks like me I like
it I like it a lot it definitely has a
little bit of that minty feel to it I
will say that this is a more driving
formula don't find it to be super cracky
or super flaky but it's not one you can
layer multiple layers over I can get
like one more layer of this before it
before it starts looking yucky but then
I have to take it off and do it again so
just be aware of that also as it dries
down it does feel a little heavy and a
little sticky like right now we're
definitely in the sticky phase and
there's always like a little tiny bit of
stick when you wear it it's not as bad
as some other ones that I've tried but
it's definitely not my favorite liquid
lipstick formula it's not bad but it's
not my favorite the wear time is really
good on it as far as like it lasts for a
really long time we'll have to do the
kiss test in a minute and see if it
transfers if I remember right they
transfer just a little tiny bit so yeah
you got to do what works for you you
know what I mean okay so let's go into
the blush and I have a couple of
different choices I was thinking about
breaking into this one this is the girls
getaway trio
I try this and I really liked it a lot
it's got these three shades in here I
don't know if this would work for deeper
skin tones though it seems like this
would be like light to medium and medium
is kind of pushing it as far as the
shade this one might still work but I
really really like these on my skin tone
or like a very fair skin tone I think
would be very good Rachel wants to know
if I've been smudged pair asthmatic sure
I can miss it romance it here's magic
sure I have a feeling it's gonna be too
nude you just have a feeling it's pretty
nude oh it's not that bad not that nude
let's do a little ombre let's try it out
monk you can see the color difference
it's a little peach year and you
actually can't really tell that big of a
difference I thought it was gonna be a
much lighter shade but it's not what
actually looks really pretty
thanks Rach unlike that it's just a
little peachy or it's kind of the same
but I do love a peach nice you're very
welcome thank you
it's not without a cute little hombre
going on thanks to you all right I'm
gonna try this girls getaway trio I'm
gonna use this shade right here this is
balm Springs I think you can get these
in in singles as well or you can get the
palette I'm more of a pallet kind of
person because I like to get smaller
things but in a palette
it's definitely very light so if you're
medium you probably don't like this so
they don't think it's gonna be dark
enough they're all mad I don't know see
I said this brush was scratching earlier
but now I'm not feeling scratch I was
and now on y'all so I don't know maybe
it was something with like my face being
fresh or something my old man but he
doesn't feel scratching anymore it's
alright so nice a little bit subtle
going on it's not super puffy so this is
more of like a going to work light kind
of look for someone with a more fair
skin tone lets punch it up a little bit
in the balm of your hands let's put on a
little bit of this insane in houndstooth
I love this one just a little bit so you
can see it more because on camera so you
put on a little bit more and when I go
pick up my daughter my mom's gonna be
like there we go I love the instinct
Watchers their secret bag okay so now
we're highlights that I like though
don't use a little bit of cindy-lou see
where I says I love blush a lot I will
go crazy applying too much and I'm okay
with it
nuts Alvah says you don't look good on
me either I can do my lips but better
but but it's really pink because I have
pigmented lips nice alright so we're
gonna do a little bit of cindy-lou and
we're gonna use the highlighter brush
from Mota right here this is a more
subtle one Cindy um Mary Lou is
definitely more um more poppy this is a
little more subtle it's a little more
pain and I had this before but it broke
in shipping and I never fixed it so I'm
happy to have one that's not very good
it's not like you can see that little
shift it's very subtle it's nice I like
it a lot Devon has a highlighter trio
that is true I don't they still sell it
though the the trio where it's got Betty
Lou Mary Lou and Cindy
I don't know I'm not sure they still
sell it or not
horror beauty FX says I like to Cindy
Lou I got it as a gift and would not
have picked it from me glad to have it
new looks bad on me 200 Rose Alba says
what blush shade looks good with a
yellow skin tone I would say go for
peaches that's my guess but I'm not a
makeup artist this brush is from the
LaMotta prismatic radiance kit it's
$19.99 you get the blush brush that I
was using this one and then the little
mini one that we're gonna try just for
fun even though I'm a little scared
we're going to take a little bit of mary
lou and I want to put it on my Cupid's
bow yeah missing logos this little baby
I don't want to look like I got a
highlighted mustache there that's pretty
that's pretty we'll do a little bit I
never do this but we're gonna do a
little bit of highlight down the center
organize sure why not I make my nose
look a little bigger it's all good all
right so how are we doing did we do
everything I think we've got everything
that's it okay so first impression of
the foundation now that it's kind of set
a little bit is that um I do see it kind
of taking a little bit around my nose
that may have the application error I
also see a little bit of mascara flakes
right here just a tad bit but I'll keep
you posted on Instagram and on on
Instagram and on snapchat so make sure
following me over at one of those so I
can show you later it looks like but I
definitely see it up close
some creasing right here and a little
bit right here so if you have large
pores or if you have wrinkles on your
face this may not be the foundation for
you the even-steven but I think I'm done
with my face I think I've beat it enough
Xander says I've seen the trio at
Nordstrom Rack for question two ten
dollars nice yeah you might be able to
catch that I think it's on its way out
the bomb sister
might be able to find me at north
shamrock that's a great great thing yeah
I don't know what the flick is Rachel I
don't know if it's flaking already or if
that was part of me applying it doing
the coats but I'll keep you posted I'll
let you know on on snapchat so I think
we're done so I want to thank you so
much for being here I really appreciate
it
and yeah just to clarify again this is
not a sponsored video but all the
products you've seen in this video were
set to me by the brand but as you know
like when someone sends me something
they know who they're sending it to you
know what I mean like they know I'm
gonna be honest about what I'm using so
they know that when they're getting into
it if they don't know it I let them be
clear with a new brand that I'm working
with I let them know ahead of time that
it's going to be fair and it's gonna be
honest and I'm going to give them give a
legit review like this is not you know
I'm making a commercial for you because
I don't do commercials so just so you
know you know that's that's where it
stands on that I know there's a lot of
weird stuff on YouTube about you know
brands sending people things and how can
you be objective when you got for free
that's how you can be objective when you
gotten free when you give them a heads
up ahead of time that you're gonna be
honest and they send it to you anyway
that's the way it is so this morning let
me make sure I got everything yes
so thanks again for being here if you
want to see an update make sure you
check on my snapchat and on my Instagram
later today and I'll be doing a lot over
there so thank you again so much for
being here that was a lot of fun
yeah I will see you guys in a video soon
mad love next up is boxycharm coming up
