livestream on the channel we've got a
couple things happening today the major
thing we're happening is the thing that
is in the thumbnail which is we are
going to open up my March FC bag it is
still sealed I did see the sneak preview
of it but goodness knows what the world
that thing was I I look at it every
month and then by the time I actually
get the bag I have no idea I don't even
remember what it was that was in there
and it always seems to be a surprise if
I open it I don't even remember what it
was but I'm going out of focus but
before we do that I did want to do a
quick PR shout out to a couple of brands
that did send me some things and I think
there's one that's over there just very
very quickly because these are things
that I don't know if we're going to
appear on the channel I just want to say
thank you very quickly to benefit they
sent me their Browse search kit they did
send this to me last year it's got a ton
of benefit brow products in it this year
they did send me the precisely my brow
which is one that I don't think I got
last year I could be wrong there I might
have just misplaced it or something I
don't know but this is one that I don't
have that I'm going to be using and
trying the high brow pencil is in here
which is amazing so the things that I
already own are going to go in for a
future giveaway we should be having a
giveaway coming up within the next month
or so is might what I really like to do
a big one on the youtube channel like I
like to do so high brow pencil the
Cabrales shade three will be in for
future giveaway the 24-hour brow setter
which is amazing will be inferred anyway
those are my favorites that are in here
they're gonna be forgiven a 3d brow
tones I'm not a fan of but that'll be in
some way as well and then the goof proof
brow pencil in shape for will also be a
pretty good way this is another one that
I really like so the only ones that are
going in for get away they don't like
the brown tones everything else is
really good I mean benefit did a great
job I feel like with their brow with
their brow line I do have a couple other
things that I have not tried the
foolproof brow powder in shade 3 I've
not tried that I will be trying to
along with the brow Zing's I did have
this at one point that I got last year
and I don't know what happened to it I
found out I was using it incorrectly
I put included it in a favorites in
sales video and then realize that you
could incorrectly and then had to take
it out and then I misplaced it and I
have no idea what I did with it so I'm
really glad to have this again so I just
wanted to let you know that that these
things whenever I get repeat PR I always
want to make sure that it goes to a good
home so a lot of this will be given away
but thank you so much benefit for
sending me that and thinking that my
brows are good enough to enter your
contest I don't know if I have as much
faith in my brow skills as benefit does
because I don't think I'm not good at
doing brows I just kind of color them in
right now I have nothing in my brows but
I'm not like a brow artist you know some
people do brows I do also want to thank
this is from Ren skincare as you know
I've even watching the channel recently
I am now taking halo Beauty vitamin so I
am NOT trying any new skincare for now
but I do would really like to try some
of this stuff I have four good things
about Ren I would love to know your
thoughts and out Ren in the comments
down below and I want to thank that for
sending this to me they sent me a few
things and I would love to know
specifically which products if you've
tried these which ones you've enjoyed
the glue the glycol lactic or knowin
radiance renewal mask the keep young and
beautiful instant brightening beauty
shot I lift the ever calm global
protection day cream and the bio
retinoid anti-aging cream so I would
love to know if you've had any
experience with those in the comments
down below if you're here alive
definitely wait until the video actually
you know what I can read the chat now on
livestream I can read it now where
before I couldn't read it after the
video was done so you can feel free
leave your comments in the lecture
because I can actually read them now and
there's one more thing but it's on the
other side hold on a second it's right
here
and you know what I just realized that I
forgot my microphone oh we can't hear me
I'm very sorry for that oh sorry about
that oh my gosh I forgot to put my mic
on hopefully you could hear the whole
beginning of it general Jenaya wants to
know if ran is cruelty free let me look
let me look here hold on let's see it
says ran cleans get no parabens sulfates
mineral oil petrolatum synthetic
fragrance synthetic colors - EAD a
glycol silicone SPG's at all rand
skincare made in the UK I don't see any
cruelty free symbols on here that
doesn't mean that they are not but I do
not see any cruelty free labels on here
so I would lead to say that they
probably are not so Rebecca said why the
benefits send you through stage 3 &amp;amp; 4
are the shades the same I'm shade 5 and
the gimme brow I'm surprised they didn't
send you a gimme brow yeah I don't know
maybe they're they kind of look at you
and decide if summer said they are
cruelty free Bobbie says good okay let
me let me just double check because I
don't want to misrepresent the brand Ren
skin care if summer said it it's
probably true because summers amazing
cruelty free let's just double check I
just want to put my personal eyes on it
even though I trust summer and I'm sure
that she is correct because she's
amazing ok ah they're owned by Unilever
logical harmony April 20th of 2015 let's
see they were acquired by Unilever
Unilever however currently does not own
any personal care of beauty brands that
do not test on animals
so I will I'll keep this window open and
i will put it I don't want to read it
all right now because that's not what
this video is about but I will leave the
link after this video is over actually
I'll put it right now in the video
description box so I don't forget so in
case you want to read this article then
it'll be in the video description I just
put it in there so hopefully people that
are alive will be able to see it ok one
more thing is that I did was sent by the
bomb they sent me all of their shades of
their their new brow products the furrow
licious which i was really excited
because they don't usually send me new
releases they usually send me things
that have been out for a while they did
send me a Schwing which i really do like
this liquid eyeliner so i will be
putting that in for future giveaway they
also sent a nude dude palette which is a
very nice palette that will go in for
future giveaway but I'm anxious to try
therefore alicia's and I'm debating
whether I want to do like swatches of
all of these but I also don't want to
waste them because I would rather them
go to homes for people that can actually
use all of the shades so maybe I'll keep
like two of them for testing one lighter
and one darker for like the inner and
outer parts of my my brows so yeah maybe
I'll do that and then I'll keep the rest
for a giveaway because I don't like
trying something for a video and then
having it go to waste you know what I
mean just for swatch purposes I have
done that and I probably will do it in
the future but it's definitely not my
favorite thing all right I did not say
hello to the people that are here in the
collective brain so let me just say
hello very quickly we're already seven
minutes in and I haven't even gotten
into the epsy bag yet hello to Megan
hello to Jenaya V from the dreamcatcher
is here hi V how are you my friend amber
is here in Tabitha B Mac is here and
Sandra and Sal and a skater skater a
true and spall Vata and Hannah and miss
Dina and Megan P and Bobby and Nancy
Mariah and Liz and Amy and Tara Kristen
and Chrissy thank you so much for being
here and if I didn't say hello to you
hello to you good to see you okay did I
get any extras this month I don't think
I got anything with points this month
their points have been terrible Lake
as far as like the things they've been
offering for points it's been like a
packet of you know sample of a deep
conditioning mask or little teeny time
their reward system is not very good but
I would really I mean the Luxy brushes
and stuff I think are great a lot of
times I'll get those kinds of things for
like future giveaway and stuff but the
points that you get really there's like
I don't even know there's I wish that
they would do something better with
their points and it's funny because I
remember talking to some people a
generation Beauty that worked for epsy
and we're talking about the point system
of Birchbox versus Ipsy when Birchbox
was a little bit bigger nourish box is
kind of fading away but they were saying
yeah we know the Burton you know that
other subscription boxes I think they
meant Birchbox have better point systems
than we do and we're really gonna work
on that there has been nothing improved
in the IPPS II point system since then I
guess it wasn't a priority because it
has not gotten any better if anything I
feel like it's gotten worse because like
I remember getting a lot of stuff from
the bareMinerals Jed nude line when it
first came out stuff like that that was
amazing they used to sell you know have
like actual good stuff in it they used
to have really good sales and really
good like deals and stuff not anymore
man it's been terrible Sara says your
video in quality looks great wish
boxycharm had a point system like
Birchbox totally agree thank you so much
for the video quality thing I got a new
webcam which i think is making a huge
difference and you think she's quitting
epsy mmm amanda says got rid of FCM
Birchbox so so little I could actually
use yeah it definitely happens alright
so this is a bot of the bag for this
month it's like a canvas bag and it's
got all these faces on it
I guess I'll look inside and see what
the theme is so we can find out what the
deal is with this it's cute it's
definitely cute I'll create is the theme
and it's like a drawing thing this month
turn yourself in your world into a work
of art very nice okay I'm not gonna read
the whole thing so in here we got oh
nice this is the bad gal bang mascara
sample which would be very nice I do
have the full size of this I would love
to do a full review on it it keeps
getting pushed to the side so it'll
probably be a pipe will be weighed down
by the time I actually get to review it
so I may not actually
review it we'll see but this would be
very very nice for the general person
that doesn't like if I had didn't get it
at the glam masters premiere I would be
so excited to see this because this was
really hyped up the whole big huge
launch over just the one product I
thought was very weird for benefit but
but yeah I think that would be wonderful
for the average you know for if I if I
didn't have that one product if I didn't
already have until size I would be very
excited that's what I'm trying to say
Lindsey didn't get it oh no I wish that
everybody got it ah I wish that
everybody got it
kay Devin says I've always wanted to get
epsy but it's about $20 Canadian dollars
of not sure if it's worth it yeah I
don't know if it's worth it either to be
honest Mandy says the faceless women
freak me out you know they are a little
creepy I get that I get it
Tara says wait is Jen going to be on
glam masters no I just went to the
premiere in New York City all right so
we've got pink pewter splash and swirl
professional makeup sponge it firm just
stealing it it feels very soft I will
use this I'm try this I'm always looking
for new sponges you know I went to a
Walmart because my daughter wanted to
get takis I don't know if you know what
takis are but they're basically like hot
cheetos but they're like um I think
they're Mexican if I would know that the
country of origin they're definitely you
know from a spanish-speaking country but
I'm pretty sure they're Mexican but you
want to get talkies from Walmart so I
went to Walmart I don't normally go to
Walmart and I looked for the the halo
Beauty oh my gosh I looked for the
flower Beauty sponge and you know they
don't sell flower beauty at my Walmart
look really no flower beauty at Walmart
was mmm so yes I was upset so I was
gonna try that but I can't now what the
world
oh they included some markers it says
its hashtag if see create and there's a
couple little markers here oh that's
cute I don't know what I'm gonna do with
them but it's cute I'll give them to my
daughter I guess shadowless says flower
beauty as at Ulta I don't know if they
sell it in my old too though in my store
I want to put my
hands on it I want you to touch it and
see it Bobby says they don't so flower
at her Walmart either what is that
Ally's here actually made it for this
live stream watching for my bed because
I'm currently sick oh I hope you feel
better soon
Ann Erica said I did get it Mexican she
said they're not her favorite my
daughter loves them her friend
introduced them to introduced her to
them alright this is it just says CB on
it it's an overnight cream apply thin
letter fleshly quit first
oh Clark's botanicals overnight rescue
cream
let us smell it smells very nice right
now I can't put any kind of skin on any
kind of new skincare on my face I'm
testing halo beauty and I'm not putting
any kind of anything on my face that is
not part of my skincare routine so this
I will either put him for future
giveaway since I did not put my fingers
in it or I will use this after I'm done
with halo Beauty twin mom says the Sonia
Kashuk sponge is good I've never tried
that one Ziggy says Jen thinks she
randomly hit markers in her FC bag no I
don't think I ran I got it markers in my
Ipsy bag they came with the bag too I
think you're supposed to decorate the
bag I would imagine but if it's part of
the theme the create theme I mean was
random did I come all
oh my gamer goes around the world and
get me martyrs no it's a we included two
markers but feel free to use as many
colors as you'd like to help you unleash
your artist within say your create share
your creation so you're supposed to
color the bag I'll let my daughter color
the bag for me if she wants to she did
you hear her she just said yay that's so
funny
alright um the warning on the bag is
funny okay wait hold on this is why I
love doing this in live stream there's a
warning on the bag it just says if CX
epic Whitter
is there a warning I'll know what your
time mom missed it tons of free my book
would you be probably I'm gonna be babe
I don't know I missed it I don't know
I'll have to check my Ulta to see a
flower beauty is there okay no the
marker pen on a minute okay here we go
it says warning to avoid
danger of suffocation you're not using
cribs characters or play pens this bag
is not a toy I don't know how you'd
suffocate with this thing but you never
know but I think they have to put that
on all bags yeah I don't know I guess is
that is that what you guys are talking
about avoid danger of suffocation since
it's so tiny and I think I have to put
it on every single bag though don't they
I think it says it on this one too
no it doesn't it doesn't say it on this
one Amy says I thought Sonia Kashuk was
too redoing her brand I don't think
she's associated with the brand anymore
I think that it's whoever owns it now I
think is doing that but I think that
they're not doing oh the grammar is
funny
Oh cribs carriages or play pens I don't
know I don't know all right next up
let's just talk about this this is the
finding Ferdinand mini lipstick I've
never heard of finding Ferdinand that's
one thing I really like about doing
these subscription boxes is the exposure
to new brands because you never know
what brand is gonna pop up next I don't
know if you can see that but there's
these tiny tiny imprint on there it's
very cute very cute influence mindset
says you already observe some
differences in your skin starting halo
beauty no that's the short answer
I've done one day eight no but I'm not
giving up because you're not supposed to
see results until two to three weeks so
as of now no but I don't have a lot of
the difficulties that people are saying
that it's helping them with so I don't
know I'm trying to give it the benefit
of the doubt I'm trying to you know be
as fair as possible with it all right
let's watch this because I'm definitely
keeping this well that's a pretty color
should I put it on my lips no mirror
makeup challenge this is a long live
stream
it smells like lipstick it's got that
old lipstick smell it's comfortable
though it feels hydrating Sammy wants me
to review the coca-cola makeup line well
yes sweetheart
it's a weird mark right well I hope
you're having fun do you want my new
markers we could have these those are
for you okay she's writing on her slime
so the lipstick I do like the color it
kind of washes me out a little bit but
without wearing makeup on I feel like it
kind of looks nice sure I kind of would
like to try the coca-cola line and see
how it goes that was Lila she says hello
okay and then the last thing in here is
skin and company truffle therapy whipped
polishing cleansing cream with truffle
extract so this is another thing let me
see if it's sealed if it's sealed I'm
not oh it is it so I can smell it it
smells like coconuts smells nice it's
got a nice scent to it it is cruelty
free it's twelve months shelf life
sulfates sulfates parabens mineral oil
and phthalate free so that's nice it's
made in Italy so cool so let's see I
definitely think this was worth $10
absolutely I mean especially at least
from first impression without having to
try anything
yup snow day that's why she's home my
kids are home because we actually have
snow in the spring I don't know why they
had off today I don't think they should
have had off today but they caught off
so it is what it is Amy says it's weird
a kind of like lipstick smell yeah oh my
girl it's not my favorite thing but
everyone has their own preferences but
anyway what I was saying was I do think
that this is worth ten dollars
especially if this sponge is good
because I will pay six dollars six to
eight ten dollars for a good blending
sponge I also am pretending like I don't
have the bad gal bang mascara and I
would say this was so it would be
something I would be very very excited
to try the lipstick I think is a really
nice pocket lipstick purse lipstick I
like shave like this because I find them
to be nice to lighten up deeper shades
like for example if I had a lipstick in
my purse and I wanted to wear it but I
wanted to
it up a little bit this would be a great
topper for those so very excited about
having that just because I like it I
don't like the Sun of it but other than
that it seems very nice the the
cleansing cream seems very nice let me
see what the ingredients are sweet
almond oil is the second ingredient in
this which is very nice
let's see yeah it's mostly it looks like
it's almond oil base which I really love
almond oil as an ingredient
so definitely excited about this whipped
cleansing cream whenever I'm able to use
it after I'm finished with halo Beauty
and then the Clarkes botanicals eye
cream let's see we've got in here some
of these things I don't know off the top
of my head shea butter beeswax so not
vegan a hobo oil it looks fine
I don't see anything in the top
ingredients that would make me go yeah
this is amazing but there are some
things that are interesting that are a
little further down but nothing that's
standing out is being like yes just from
my own Bank of knowledge I'd have to
look up a couple of these things though
because a couple of them I don't look
familiar to me but yeah this will
probably end up in future giveaway I'll
probably use this though because I
really like Meghan said Clark's
botanicals is very expensive awesome
see I don't know I don't know I might
have to look it up I don't know but I am
excited to try this so I definitely
think this is worth the $10 subscription
I don't think that they took my money I
don't think I'm not upset about it I'm
very thankful to have this for ten
dollars I think it's a good deal but
yeah that was what I wanted to tell you
oh I forgot to mention this in the
beginning I meant measures in the very
beginning the reason why we're doing a
livestream today instead of a regular
edited video is because my Dominik
cosmetics review is not finished yet
I filmed everything except for the
swatches I need to film the swatches
today I've edited up through the first
day's wear test I missed I'm in the
middle of editing the second day's wear
test I have the third days wear tests
the swatches I'm hoping I can do all of
that editing between now and tomorrow
before I have to film what's it been
makeup that's the plan
worst case is we have to push Dominik
cosmetics to next Tuesday I really
really hope I don't have to do that
because I would really like to move on
with my life
it's kind of like the whole halo thing I
was working on that and working on it
and working on it working on it and I
just it was a lot and I was very happy
to move on from that I'm gonna be very
happy to move on from the Dominique
palette because I'm putting a lot of
time in it so I've got so much good
stuff coming up for you that I really
want to film but it's really gonna
depends on if I can get this Dominique
cosmetics video done today whether it'll
be up tomorrow or on Tuesday so I don't
like to do a live stream for my Thursday
upload it is not my favorite thing to do
I would much rather give you an edited
video but kids have been home and if I
have an excuse kids have been home and
hey love you to kick my butt
so those are my excuse but yeah it's
coming and the Dominic video is really
really good I'm very proud of it I think
you're gonna get a lot of really good
information from it and and yeah I want
to I want to make sure I do a really
good job with it for you so thank you so
much for being here for the live stream
I appreciate you have a wonderful
wonderful weekend if I don't see you
before the weekend we are going to be
having live chat on Sunday we're going
to continue our discussion of Ulta 21
days of beauty on Sunday and yeah thanks
again so much for being here and mad
love to you thank you for everybody here
