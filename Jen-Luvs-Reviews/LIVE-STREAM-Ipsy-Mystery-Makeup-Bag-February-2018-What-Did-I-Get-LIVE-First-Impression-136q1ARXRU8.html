don't know why I've been doing that
recently when I go on livestream I just
go like this
it's like Pippi longstockings I just
need some like coat hangers to hold my
hair over to the side how is everyone
today we are going to be doing a live
stream on my Ipsy bag the big reason why
I do these because people ask me you
know why are you doing live gyms where I
even talking about Ipsy nobody even
talks about em cima because my audience
seems to really like them and how I know
that is they get lots of thumbs ups and
they get a decent amount of views so as
long as people are seeming to enjoy them
I'm going to continue doing them listen
this isn't your favorite format I'm
sorry I have lots of other videos in the
channel and I'm hoping that you all will
enjoy so a happy Valentine's Day to
everybody out there I am going out on a
date with my husband as soon as I'm done
with this live stream we're gonna go out
to lunch as our Valentine's Day date I'm
gonna put on a little bit of makeup I
was thinking about using gonna pause
from the FC for a second I just got this
in PR from this brand it is called glam
light and it looks like a really neat I
shadow palette not sponsored hashtag not
sponsored it just showed up in my
mailbox the owner's name is Giselle
Hernandez and yeah it says it's a new
glam light it says we're so thrilled to
have you be part of the new glam like
cosmetics family promoting positivity
female empowerment love and unity
through the world it's a small boutique
brand they have big dreams on
transforming the makeup industry as they
know it in a positive way providing
affordable luxury cosmetics across the
globe so women can have an amazing
opportunity to be the most glamorous I
was in a variety of creative looks so it
looks like it's a brand new brand so I
figured I would show it to you I think
I'm gonna throw on a quick look with
this but isn't that pretty
I mean is it super you know unique to
what's happening right now in the market
no but that this shade right here is
called hashtag gold and I thought that
was really cool that it's more of like
an antique gold rather than a like a
bright gold I thought that was really
pretty let me swatch a couple of the
mattes for you I know this isn't epsy
but I want to show it to you because
they are smaller brand
and they did send it to me and yeah I
mean the Matt's look decent swatching
wise I mean of course isn't that what
performs in the eye but but yeah I'm
excited to try this out so I'm gonna try
this out and then I'm gonna put up a
snapchat about it so if you're not
following me on snapchat follow me over
there I'm just John Laws reviews over
there I know that the format is crazy
right now but my subscribers seem to be
able to find me I'm still getting the
same number of views on snapchat is that
I always did my friend Laura over at
mrs. Lowell Lynn said it's not going to
affect the smaller people on snapchat as
much as it affects the bigger people but
like the snapchat update that just
happened but yeah so I'm gonna put up a
snapchat of the look of this once I
create it so if you follow me over there
you'll be able to see it so let me go
ahead and quickly say hello to the
people that are here in the collective
brain of makeup awesomeness
also known as the people that are here
in live chat when I invite someone into
my home I like to say hello so hello to
Michelle and Keller trep chin hello to
you Prince's makeup is here Bobby is
here Dale is here Jennifer Jackie
Charlie everything Ellie is here Stacy
and Rachel and Julie and Bobby and
Laurie and Linda and Cindy and Rebecca
and Emily I believe I already said
princess makeup I did and if I did not
say hello to you oh and I have to say
hello to Kristen but now who has been
leaving me the most beautiful little
pink hearts lately actually for quite a
while and I don't think I've officially
recognized you Kristen and thank you for
all of the wonderful comments you've
been leaving on my videos so thank you
so much for that and hello to Aspen and
Carolina as well Karolina I'm not sure
where you pronounce your high pronounce
your I in there where is the palette
from someone was asking let us look it
says that distributed by glam like
cosmetics Inc Hollywood California
designed and assembled in the US and
made in the PRC other than that I don't
know anything about this palette so yeah
but I will update you on snapchat of how
the look came out but it's good to see
you all and let's go ahead and get into
this it's Mandy Mac okay so I did get a
few extras with epsy points I get FC
points when people sign up using my link
which is in the description box down
below the first thing I got was a Luxy
brush and I misplaced my highlighter
brush from Loxy
and I really really like their
highlighter brushes I don't think I had
this exact one I think the one that I
had was a little bit longer than this
but I really love the shape of a brush
with the like deep taper on it I feel
like it picks up a lot of product and
Luxy brushes are so soft I also don't
own any of their blue brush line so I
wanted to get one of those so I got that
with epsy points so thank you to people
that sign up using my link I also got
this with epsy points this is the lychee
and gold healthy glow rose gold blush by
Sarafine botanicals I just thought it
looked really pretty
I thought we would try it Alice says she
loves those brushes I agree hello Liz
plumbin how are you good to see you
longtime subscriber somebody says live
is here is that live oh it is live Happy
Valentines today too in voluntee you
live from live loves her makeup if you
were not subscribed to her I definitely
recommend you go over and check her out
some of the most honest and
straightforward yet spattered with curse
words reviews on all of the internet so
definitely recommend you check her out
for honest reviews so let's go ahead and
swatch this Serafina botanicals now I
don't really like my blushes super
pigmented because I feel like then it
takes you to clown face too fast but
that looks really really pretty and I'm
very excited to try that on the cheeks
because it's nice and soft I don't
believe this would show up on anyone
more than like a medium skin tone but it
is really pretty for my skin tone so I'm
happy that I picked it up I don't know
about their shade range as far as
overall again the brand is called
Seraphine botanicals but I'm glad I got
that with my FC points looks like it's
gonna be a nice blush now this bag is so
stinking cute oh my gosh it's adorable
but I have to say that the material it's
made out of feels so incredibly cheap
like it just feels like can you hear it
I'll put it next to my microphone like
it just feels crunchy like weird and on
the I can tell on the inside it's gonna
be super cheap plastic okay so it's got
like that I don't know vinyl ish really
cheap inside but again this is a $10
subscription $10 a month so what do I
expect
had really nice FC bags in the past so I
kind of hope that it's gonna be super
nice but this one definitely feels much
less expensive even though it is very
pretty
Marina says she loves the lip products
from Sarafine that is great to know all
right so this theme is unzipped and
they've got a bunch of lovely ladies and
gentlemen in their underwear just
hanging out and I like that they've got
some men in there some like non made-up
men I think that's so cute and you've
got women with tattoos and wheelchairs
with gray hair women of different body
shapes so that's really cool I like that
twin mom says you decide on hair
extensions I am actually going to go get
my hair done in two weeks I think on the
24th of February and I'm gonna talk to
my stylist about that my husband saw
Stephanie Nicole's extensions on her
Instagram and he was like Jan you need
to get on these well he said Jennifer
cuz he doesn't call me Jen he's like
Jennifer we thought about getting these
because her extensions look amazing so
I'm gonna talk to my stylist about that
and see what she says she's amazing so
she's actually a teacher at a school so
she knows a lot she's very very
knowledgeable so at a hair school not a
not a school school so just says being
sexy isn't limited to a certain size
shape or age and I think that's really
sweet I wish we saw more of this in
marketing I really like that perfectly
broken Sammy says my first time in live
chat - I'm so happy that you're here
okay so let's look and see what's in the
bag so this is by Maersk and this is
made in Sydney it says Sydney and London
I don't know I've had really good luck
with Maersk eyeshadows so let's go ahead
and open this up and swatch it Maersk I
have a few products by them and I've
really enjoyed them I've only ever
gotten stuff from their subscription
boxes from subscription boxes and things
not their subscription boxes but from
some scripture subscription boxes so
I've never actually purchased anything
from them but everything I've ever
gotten from them I've really enjoyed and
let's take that little sticker off and
then what I usually do to get this stuff
out as I go like this and then Oh
Loreena says hi Jenna recently
discovered your channel and now and I
have to watch all your videos absolutely
love you oh thank you Lorena I
appreciate that so much
you know all you can do is put out your
love into the internet and just hope
that people like it and I'm glad that
you like it thank you
oh my gosh look at that oh he's so
pretty it's so pretty
oh my gosh it's got a beautiful shine to
it let me see how it looks on camera
it's about a 30 second delay between
when I swatch it it doesn't look super
opaque but I'm not hating on that I'm
not hating on that at all
Ida says she loves me I love you too I
die even though I don't know you you
seem like a wonderful person already
because you love me so if you love me I
I guess I love you back truly lovely
says she's on the wait list for
boxycharm Lauren loves my videos thank
you so much
Oh Monica is here hi Monica okay so I
got another lucky brush this one I'm
actually going to pass on I know that I
am even though I'm very interested in
this shape but I don't prefer
double-ended brushes so I'm gonna try
not to touch the brush part but it's got
that a double-ended brush I like to
store my brushes this way so I feel like
they get kind of crushed if it's like
this or like this so I don't prefer
brushes like this bye know some people
store their brushes and drawers where
this would be perfect so I'm gonna go
ahead and put this in my giveaway box
for a future giveaway my giveaway stuff
isn't is definitely oh if I can get it
back in is definitely getting pretty
full so that tells me there needs to be
another giveaway soon come on come on
there we go
okay so this is definitely gonna go and
giveaway but it is a very nice brush for
people that may not have a brush like
that Luxy brushes are fabulous okay next
we have Bang Beauty and this is yeah
I've got Cheri and Estella both don't
like double-ended brushes either
this is bang blush bang beauty blush and
smoked peach let's see what do we got
going on here can I get it open
do I have to bang it open is that that
part of their stick there alright there
we go and let's see if we can get okay
let's see oh that's darker so this would
be looks like it can be shared out which
is nice or built up
we try to build it up a little bit it's
a very kind of true bright pink Margaret
wants to know my favorite blush my
favorite blush formula is the the bombs
in stain blushes those are my favorites
because I love the way they build this
seems very nice as well Melissa says
I've recently discovered your channel I
just love your content thanks for being
you Jen Oh Melissa that means so much to
me thank you
Liz wants to know how my daughter's
doing with her braces she just got her
braces on yesterday she was a little
achy this morning we gave her some
Tylenol and she's doing much better now
thank you for asking and then mommy
where's more pain hello she's got a
great channel too you should check her
out mommy where's more paint she's got a
smaller channel if you like smaller
channels which a lot of people are
really gravitating toward there's
smaller channels mommy where's war paint
okay but yeah this seems very very nice
I'm excited about that I've got two more
things this is the spot on targeted
brightening serum from mad skincare ma D
so you suppose the cleansers face pat
dry and apply spot on targeted skin
brightening sim apply spot on targeting
skin brightening serum to the affected
area are all over the face and neck
avoiding contact with eyes I would
probably pass this on because I don't
feel like I need skin brightening but I
will I will pass this on and see if
there's anybody that can use this it is
a multi vitamin C complex so I need to
pass it on quickly I don't want to throw
this in a giveaway box because if I
don't give it away it'll go bad so I
need to pass that on relatively quickly
okay and then the last thing in here
Nikki Murphy in the house hi Nikki
Murphy how are you my friend so good to
see you another great YouTube channel
alright this is by Melo Cosmetics and I
think I've tried some things through
subscription boxes by Melo before but
they're not standing out in my mind I
don't remember them okay so this is a
matte liquid lip paint and let's go
ahead first the scent smells a little
hmm it doesn't smell strong but it
definitely smells chemically and then
let's go ahead and put it on here it's
kind
one of those 80s brown shades very nice
all right let me go ahead and put this
on my lips even though I don't have a
mirror hmm where can i let's see who did
this is this bang lip cheek product have
a mirror in it I can't get this stupid
thing open laramie says jenna me ever
checked the expiration dates on
subscription box items I'm just curious
about the life of them I have not but
that is a smart idea
kool Kat once said I thought you're
going to stop if see I would know it's
Birchbox i unsubscribe from Birchbox i
am going to continue getting epsy
they're going to $10 a month
subscription of this so i can see the
confusion alright this looks like my
lips it feels very smooth to go on very
light that's pretty I like these like
almost like your lips but better a kind
of color it's really pretty I really
like that a lot
I'm gonna keep that on I'm gonna wear
this today right now it just feels kind
of a little on the oily side I can't
smell it I'm gonna wait for it to dry
down let me wipe this before I get it
all over my shirt happy Valentine's Day
Nadine it does match my top and I think
it's gonna match with my eyeshadow that
I put on this right here I think it's
gonna match with that really really well
so right now it still feels comfortable
it's not drying down yet so not sticky
so that's good
Valerie says it looks really Brown on
camera is that what it is in real life
yes it does look like that in real life
let me just look I had this big mirror
it's actually more red tone than what
you're seeing on camera so it's drying
down to being a little bit more warm it
looks a little cooler on camera but it's
definitely a brown tone so I'm just
gonna keep going and let it kind of sit
it's definitely it's not sticky at all
it's comfortable let's see if we can do
it's definitely not kiss proof so
probably similar if I have to compare it
just in this
from just trying it on I would compare
it more to the ofra liquid lipsticks it
doesn't feel dry in any way Karolina
wants to know if I can do a
monochromatic look possibly in the
future possibly in the future Jennifer
says I got the Ofra and I'm UPSI
unzipped I like that formula oh okay
so the shade is unzip oh if she unzipped
yes that was the name of the shade
I like that formerly never tried before
I really like the Ofra formula a lot
Christy says she got the Jacqueline Hale
palette because of me and she adores it
yeah I'm so glad
Emily saying ibuprofen and naproxen
helped more than Tylenol because it
helps the swelling in the mouth that is
great to know and you know what it's so
funny imagine that because I actually
did not give her Tylenol I gave her IV
profane I just call them all Tylenol I
don't know it's kind of like Kleenex
like you can call it a tissue you can
call it a whatever I always call
everything Tylenol but I did give her IV
prophetic okay so I feel like this is
kind of at its full dryness it's very
comfortable I'm actually quite
pleasantly surprised with this the shade
is I think it's Tehran I don't know how
to pronounce this I'm sorry if I'm
butchering it
teh RA n and it's there matte liquid lip
paint and it feels very comfortable but
again it's first impression so we can't
really give it a full review Charlie got
the Julia's place palette because of me
oh and heart heart hearts that makes me
so happy when I can give good advice and
people end up purchasing something and
then they're happy with their purchases
it makes me so happy because everybody
has everybody has their different
preferences and I'm never going to match
up with everybody perfectly but I try
really hard to put a lot of research and
thought into my reviews before I
recommend something so like as far as
like this mellow I can tell you that it
feels really great right now I like the
way that it looks but it's not a full
review at this point Kristen says is
you're looking review on the Crayola
palette coming soon I'm actually taking
a break from reviewing it today I've
done two looks with it and film them I
have one look left we're gonna do it
tomorrow I was gonna do it today I'm
going full on pride we're gonna have
rainbow eyes and it's going to be so
much fun I was going to do it today and
my husband said he want to go out on a
date so I thought rainbow pride eyes
would be a little bit weird going out
till lunch date he
told me just go for it and do it anyway
but I wanted to try this out too so
we're just gonna do that
so anyway I'm gonna go ahead and pop off
here but before I do let's just say
about how whether I feel like this was
worth ten dollars absolutely I feel like
content wise this is a great bag
not that because that didn't come with
it the blush where's the square blush
where did it go here it is okay so the
bank is great and definitely adds to the
value I think the brush is wonderful
really excited about the lipstick this
would be great for the right person and
then what was the last item mmm oh the
maersk eyeshadow which seems really nice
so this is definitely well worth well
over ten dollars
I would pay $10 just for the brush at
least the blush I would pay at least a
six ish for the sample size of this I
would pay three or four dollars for it
for this for the right person maybe a
dollar or two for the sample size and
for the maersk eyeshadow three or four
dollars because it is smaller so this is
definitely worth well over $10 excellent
job if see happy Valentine's Day to you
all I hope you have a lovely day and you
know Valentine's Day is not just about
people loving you but it's also loving
yourself so please do something nice for
yourself today take a bath drink a cup
of coffee sitting outside if it's nice
outside you know give yourself a nice
hairbrush or something you know do
something pampering for yourself sheet
mask if you like that a bath do
something nice and show yourself some
love for Valentine's Day because I don't
feel like in this day and age we give
ourselves enough love so you know do
something nice for you today because you
deserve it you're worth it you're
amazing thank you again so much for
being here and that love to you and I
will see you in a video very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
