much for being here for live chat and
prompt you like chats on my lips I do
want to apologize before we go any
further that there won't be an edited
video today I'm not sure if you can tell
but my eyelids are a little bit swollen
from the video I recorded yesterday what
I did was I put this up on snapchat but
in case you don't follow me on snapchat
basically what happened was is I what
happened was was that I put a I put a
bunch of swatches on my eyes so I'm
doing like a flea old eyeshadow smack
down video so I'm putting it the
eyeshadow on would say like them I don't
know the L'Oreal infallible I don't know
okay that's one of them so I put it on
with my finger on this side and then I
put on the mac 242 on this side and then
i zoom it in so you can see it and then
I'm gonna give you like a little then
I'm gonna tell you what it is so you can
kind of think well that looks good that
doesn't look good before you even know
what brand it is and I feel like that's
gonna be a fun way to see like what we
think of quality without being
influenced by the brand name you know
what I mean so I thought that would be
really fun but I apparently did too many
swatches and I irritated my eyes and
then when I went to go look at the
footage I noticed that specifically with
the one from Pat McGrath $125 eyes
shadow palette my eye is completely out
of frame like totally out of frame and
then there's a couple of other ones
where there's a clear cover a couple of
other ones where my eye is like mostly
out of frame that you still see it when
I'm applying it with the brush but you
can't completely see it and I want to
refill those shots because it really
just doesn't look good so the video was
like 75 percent edited I probably could
have put it up today but I want those
swatches I want you be able to see me
actually applying the iShare with the
brush and I just don't feel comfortable
doing multiple swatches on their eyes
and so my eyelids I mean as you know the
eye area is very sensitive I shouldn't
have done it in the first place I
probably won't do it again
but that's why there isn't an edited
video today is because I'm sure I just
want to make it better
hopefully I can we're really busy
weekend but I really want to get that up
on Monday for you
so I'm trying but I just want to let me
know why this is this live stream it's
replacing a regularly at a good video it
wasn't on purpose so but anyways you
were here for the IPPS II under it says
caution heat package away from direct
sunlight I thought that was interesting
I've never seen not on FC bag before
before I open this I do want to say
hello to the people that I've invited in
my home in the live chat let me go ahead
and say hello very quickly oh my
goodness there's so many people here
already yay hi Rachel and Sal good

but one day I hope to make it to Brazil
if you don't know what epsy is it is a
monthly beauty subscription where you
pay $10 a month to get a beauty bag a
mystery Beauty bag full of items now I
have been getting this for a very long
time this is not a sponsored video and
I've been paying for it for a very long
time so just so you know I'm not getting
paid to do this so first thing I got was
something that has been requested to be
reviewed on my channel by most of the
people and I saw it as a point perk like
if you sign up using my link I get
who-who's points and I can use them
toward items and this is something
that's been requested a lot I don't
think this is a full-size
naj lips sleeping mask I'm gonna open
this I did get this with points so if
you sign up using my link it is because
of you that I have this now it is very
very very tiny but I think it's gonna be
enough that I'll be able to try it so I
have gotten so many requests ooh
it's softer than I thought it was gonna
be okay it's kind of soft let's put it
on it's really on low in Greece $10 is a
deal really says I think so sometimes if
you're not gonna use anything then it's
not worth it but if you are gonna use
things it's definitely worth it I know
that's not an obvious statement but okay
so initial first impression is it feels
very oily it smells very slightly of
strawberries but it's very light it's
not a really strong scent and it's not a
plasticy strawberry sound like a lot of
lip products didn't feel very very you
know snow very plasticky what are the
ingredients on this it's the base oh my
gosh am I getting my order something I
cannot leave that oh my gosh I can't
believe it I can bear I can barely read
it the first ingredients are things that
I don't recognize so I'll have to give
them those ingredients but I would love
to do a I would love to do a full review
of this or at least like a mini review
or something with this oh my gosh
somebody just said that the Billy says
Little Rock Pirates they carry the
impalas on HauteLook
yeah it's so good I hope a lot of people
get how people get the blush palette to
blush palette is really good it is an
overnight mask GG um yes it's supposed
to be but who says you can't wear it
during the daytime you don't have to
follow all the rules all the time but
anyway this wasn't part of my bag this
was just an extra that I ordered so
let's talk about the bag here I am NOT a
fan of his bag I I don't like this I
think it is quite not cute I wish I had
the bag from last my blog ones but there
is a gorgeous bag I like that it's a
little bit possible but I I'm not
attracted to this this this is not like
you tonight so if it looks cute to you
you'll have to explain to me why what am
I missing
what am I missing because this is not
true at all alright first thing in here
is the NYX
right this is that one of their lip
products this would probably go in for a
future giveaway I have tried this
product before I don't enjoy it I find
it to be very very drying and not
comfortable and also the shade is
something I have similar things I don't
wear this kind of shade very often it's
kind of a dark not dark I kind of an
ashen Brown
it's called satin ribbon it's okay I
might use this shade but because I've
tried to spoil you and I are you know I
don't like it I'm not gonna open it dry
Daria Daria says did you snag the bad
habit do for the abh mario it literally
dropped 11 minutes from the app I
ordered with zero lag nice no I did not
get that I didn't Gina says the bad
girls Fair is juvenile yeah I can see
that like maybe like a preteen or like
even like my daughter would probably
like this like that she loves blue so
maybe she would like this be able to use
it for something on me someone had a
great idea to donate these bags to
programs for teenagers to high schools
for girls that are just starting their
feminine cycles that this is a great way
for them to keep their the things that
they may need through the day in school
that they can keep them in these little
bags and they meaning may enjoy that so
I'm thinking about gathering the bunch
of those and going to local high school
falling revise for emailing them saying
hey could you use some of these bags nor
calling the nurse's office I thought
that was a really good idea but that was
smart
all right let's see Lori says the bag
reminds me of the eighties track suit
nice and bright
alright this right here is a contour
palette by city color now if you don't
know City color city color is a plan
that is sold at my a local store that we
have called 5 below I don't think being
reach very far west but I'm pretty sure
they go into like the central part of
the country these are very inexpensive
products you can get a contour palette
for five dollars at five below so this
is very you know a smaller version of it
I've had hit misses with city color what
I find most especially the cheap
products is that they are insanely
pigmented to the point where they go on
to dark and can be very hard to blend
out I wish they would come up with more
eyeshadow palettes they're similar to
achieve palettes so I feel like they
would be more functional as I
that's rather than cheap products so I'm
gonna go ahead and just watch this for
you real quick
I appreciate that there are some deeper
shades in here so it looks like we've
got there they're very very soft they're
not as power E as I remember city color
stuff being now that seems very nice I
people might be able to use these so I'm
actually excited Oh Fatima says we now
send five pillows in California are
wonderful I'm glad that they've expanded
because I do really like that store I
think they have some really good stuff
um let's see okay so anyway it looks
like the white is a little bit chalky
I'm not sure what I'll use that for
maybe an inner corner of highlights I
think honestly the thing I might use
actually agrees with me this really deep
shade here because I think it might be a
nice contour shade if I'm gentle enough
so just would be great highlight bronzer
contour and also could be used for many
skin turns I don't know if somebody's
really fairly be able to use this which
might be use it as eyeshadow as well
that might be nice on to contour the
eyes rather the cheeks this because it
says contour palette doesn't even ask to
use on the face then we use on the eyes
too so the this one is cold toned who is
that so cool tone Monique says it looks
cool toned this one more cool toned but
this one is definitely the bronzer sure
is definitely more warm toned
I personally perform work but for more
cool toned contours and I don't really
use a lot of phones or is that just my
personal about that's okay what do we
have next
okay so we have absolute New York Eye
artist East our teeth teeth are artiste
eye artiste Gigi says I'm never I never
here city color or five below she turn
to check it out
biotechs bio an index said there are
five boroughs in Florida I thought they
might be informal so here's that Emily
wants to know if I'm doing my boxycharm
video yes that should be toward the end
of the month I did just receive it I'm
still testing out the stuff from
November and December I'm not quite done
testing them I feel like I'm almost done
testing the products from November and
December but I'm not quite ready to film
that yet but I'm working on it working
on still testing things
Julie says she got the city color menu -
Cheryl says my poor eyes look swollen
they feel swollen good I am still gonna
put on some eye shadow today but I don't
know like I mean I shadow is pretty easy
to remove overall so I just feel like as
long as I just put on one color and not
remove it until the end of the day and
just remove one and not 20 different
colors I'll be a whole upstate
New York jazz says that she has some to
it awesome okay so let's let's watch
this I artist artiste from absolute New
York I haven't had the best experiences
from absolutely work I did get some
products from them from a generation
Beauty event by Ipsy so I'm gonna put
that right next to that's pretty
hopefully you can see that hopefully I'm
not going to class I'll forth sometimes
I go way too fast when I heard that to
the camera but that is the eyeshadow
down there it's very pretty but I
haven't had good luck especially with
their lip products I find them to be
very dry so I haven't really done
anything on the channel with them
because they're either just kind of okay
or dry for the lip products for absolute
if I found anything that was like Skyler
and amazing I would totally um show you
guys it but Nana says my skin looks
amazing thank you so much and Kristi
says you seem to have the glowing spirit
oh thank you it's funny because when I
was on who's my mirror says it looks
like a pretty thing and what's funny is
to me it looks more brown but then I
held it up to the camera it definitely
seemed more pink so it's definitely one
of those that's really hard to place
what shade it is it's like a brownie
pink
it's very pretty so I'll have to try
that and see how that goes and then max
I feel like this is this is doing pretty
well for a $10 bag so far this is Lulu
by Jean Co Balan it's hydrating and
calming serum off to see whether I can
put that on my eyes so I could use some
hydrating and calming on my eyeballs
right now so it looks like it's it says
directions step 2 of Lu is a skin serum
so I would imagine you know will be
after toning out cleansing toning and
serum
usually how it goes apply a thin layer
after cleansing my gosh my eyes are not
working today use morning and night
discontinued use a trash bubblegum box
it looks like it's water sodium higher
learning potassium sorbate and I think
that's a preservative and sodium
benzoate so it looks like it's basically
water and hyaluronic acid so that's not
cool I already I have a cure hyaluronic
acid that I add into my serum so I
wouldn't use this directly as it's no I
might be wrong on those other
ingredients as far as being
preservatives I'd have to look them up
to make sure it's very slimy feeling but
that's typical for a for hyaluronic acid
to be a little bit slimy but then like
right now it's drying and it's starting
to feel like when you're drying your
hands and it feels a little tacky almost
but not sticky and now it's starting to
disappear completely so it's got a
really nice link to it right now and now
I don't feel it at all it's gone so this
would be something I would add into
other products just because I want to
make sure I've got something to help it
seep into the skin as well rather than
just the just the hyaluronic acid if
with the kind of needs more in there
let's see what's happening around here
oh let's see oh did I say Mirror Mirror
I'm sorry it's Mariah not Meera
I apologize I'll try to get it right
next time Alya Marat yeah that makes
sense I got you I got you
Maribel ISA is important
hopefully you're doing okay oh my gosh
well you have internet so that's a good
sign
hopefully you're doing okay I've been
thinking about all of you in Puerto Rico
Jaime how are you the dream catcher is
here when my favorite up-and-coming
channels
have you tried to play by support I have
not okay or or I would say this wrong or
they think it's or been whoa are ibe
gold lost dry shampoo okay I've been
wondering about this whether it's
actually gold it's like regular dry
shampoo I'm gonna spray it whoa I don't
see any gold that's a good thing I was
worried it was gonna put um gold in my
hair like a like a spray glitter or
something like that this stuff came out
like really really really strong but I
do love dry shampoo so I'm all about
trying that I believe that is a very
pricey brand and then we have the card
whoa I can smell it now got a very
strong hair spray kind of smell without
so much alcohol but still very um
hairspray Guinea or B is it or B Alvis
says it's or B I thought it was for babe
I don't know I could be wrong I always
forget that it's that one and then
there's a couple of them that always
have to look
oh maybe Oh rip over being Erica says Oh
Ruby really or eBay or eBay or eBay
rachel says or ebay okay let's go with
that because we've got we've got some
consensus on or eBay and then Tabitha
says or bag like eBay I don't know
there's a card in here it says game
phase it's got some stuff on there and
it says I will conquer them and there's
a line it's kind of cute I guess so I
guess business but oh yeah this is like
the track and field it's supposed to be
like track suit kind of thing I get it I
get it
I still don't think it's cute so the
question is is this worth ten dollars of
my hard earned money this I like I'm
excited about this I'm surprised that
I'm excited about this
because like the swatch makes me happy I
do really like this as far as the
ingredients this will be nice add-in I
don't like this I will not use that kind
of excited about this so I do feel like
this was worth ten dollars I'm happy
with it
I especially with this I feel like this
kind of puts it over because this is a
really nice addition to any skincare
routine
I feel so yeah I'm happy with it I don't
know how much the retail price is
because if she doesn't include it didn't
even include include like another little
card that like even pretends to be like
information I wish if she would change
that but I don't know what you want what
you think what do you think do you think
my dad was worth ten dollars would you
have wanted this for ten dollars I like
it and if you got an Ipsy bag what did
you think of yours was it worth ten
dollars to you that's what I want to
know Billy says it would be worth it to
hear her Ryan says if you change your
profile and move Nick's
as being the brand that you want to try
sending you though so his products oh
okay yeah you can change your profile
around to try to get different things so
Peyton says I got four full-size items
in one travel size my bag over $79 holy
moly Peyton holy moly
are these awful size no they are not I
would imagine that this is definitely
full size the mix the eyeshadow is
probably full sized but I would have met
I know that the arm book the dry shampoo
is not full size this does not appear to
be full size and this does not appear
because sighs if you're looking for full
size you want to go $21 yeah boxycharm
but I have some some little news to
spill to you I was not asked to sign a
nondisclosure for this so I'm gonna let
you know I was asked to fill out a
survey with if see about possibly I'm
doing more full sized items like that
they may change the subscription price
or give you an option to upgrade your
subscription they're thinking about it I
believe like they were kind of asking
opinions on it to upgrade your ffz
subscription with full-size product so
maybe it would be a twenty dollar
subscription and you would get your FC
items plus three full sized items or two
full sized items you know I forget
exactly what the dollar amounts were I
can't remember from the survey but or
you know you could pay you know fifteen
dollars for your FC items plus one
full-size or you could pay you know some
of the options were like you know will
you take $20 as a completely different
subscription where you wouldn't get this
anymore but you would get all full-size
items and it seems to me that they're
trying to compete with bokki tron
because lucky charm is kicking it so
that's that was the survey I was given
we'll see whether it actually comes out
to fruition and anything should be
interesting to see where do what
direction if C goes any of you know you
might know Michelle Phan is no longer
with FC she's now focusing solely on em
cosmetics so it's clear I'd be curious
to know what direction they're gonna
skip see now that they do not have
Michelle involved you know they're there
they're different people that are Gigi
wants to know if she is the one that
Gabriel Zamora works for yes Gabriel was
blew up due to Ipsy if she found Gabriel
and blew him up he's so adorable when I
picked his cheeks all the time he's so
cute
I've met him a couple of times and he's
always seemed very down to earth and
very sweet so I root for Gabriel I
really real but anyway I should probably
pop off here because it's been 20
minutes originates the bags are only
like 10 to 15 minutes I'm gonna pop off
here I'm actually going to go get ready
to film what's at the make up I'm gonna
pop over to periscope which is where I
get ready for what's at the make up if
you're not on periscope it's a Twitter
live streaming app that's where I get
ready so I'm gonna go in through there
I'm gonna hop upstairs that my products
ready and pop over to periscope to get
ready for him what's a good makeup and I
will see you guys in a video very very
soon hopefully that what I swatch video
will be coming up for you soon as well
as I also have a video on an updated
ride-or-die tag that was requested on
Twitter as well so all right I'm gonna
go ahead and pop off thank you so much
for being here I appreciate you all so
much and mad love to you and I will see
you in a video
