down I never leave the volume up noob
mistake how's everybody doing I figured
I was I'm editing what's up makeup but I
got my Ipsy bag and I've gotten so many
requests to undo it back to doing more
on Baggins but it's like I can't fit
anymore editing time in so I figured
this would be a great way for me to show
you what I got in my Ipsy bag tell you
my first impressions of things without
having to add extra time to my schedule
other than the 15 or 20 minutes that's
gonna take me to film this so before I
get going I just want to quickly say
hello to the people that are here so
thank you so much for being here if you
were able to make your life I just
announced it about five minutes ago so
there really wasn't a lot of time to
prepare so of course Tabitha is here
thank you for being here my friend
Banshee muse good morning and Amie is
here first live stream for her that is
so awesome
Esther Lynn is here I'm so happy you're
here katie is here and we meet good
morning to you happy Saturday Lindsey is
here she says excited to hear your
thoughts on MC I personally feel like
it's getting better with time as long as
you review your bags each month but
nobody really talks about it anymore
yeah I mean I feel like if she is
definitely trying to step up their game
I think they have a big competition in
boxycharm and you know but this is a lot
less expensive so if they can get even
close to what boxycharm is then I think
that they're in a good place you know
that boxycharm of course you know not
everybody is gonna want to spend 21
dollars a month but if they can get some
full-size products and if they can get
some higher quality products in and not
you know and some recognizable brands I
think that makes a big difference so
Esther Lynde says not gonna lie everyone
else keeps getting their Epstein I still
haven't gotten mine oh no Mimi says
she's loving her Laura beauty box nice I
used to get that one a really long time
ago when it was called sample society
but that was a really long time ago
really really long time ago
BAM you stopped her her subscription and
if I didn't say hello to you hello to
you welcome let's go ahead and open this
baby up
David Lee says yes I only get to see you
live this is awesome it's awesome to
have you
mahlia says I'm sick of crappy colored
nail polish it's so funny because the
thing is is like with these
subscriptions everyone has their
different tastes you know I did get a
couple of little extras I got this
Jasmine water full sleeping pack I think
I got these with FC points and this is
by a brand I can't even pronounce it
because the letters are like backwards
this says BR TCC I'm a br ITC and then
back backwards I don't know
blue phyto complex purple vigor complex
Oh No
Jessica says I just subscribed a julep
how's that julep is amazing I love my
jolt subscription I hate to say it
though I'm probably gonna unsubscribe
soon because I feel like I pretty much
have everything after being a subscriber
of it for years and years and years I I
don't really need any more of the julep
stuff at this point but then they keep
coming up with new things that make me
want to keep subscribing so I haven't
pulled the plug yet but it's not because
I don't like it just because I thought I
have everything so I got the bye bye
pressed pours a sample this will
probably end up in like as an extra in a
giveaway I sometimes I like to use my
Ipsy points for things that I've already
tried then I know that I like and then
just throw them in my giveaway box for a
future so this is the bag and I really
like this bag it's definitely different
it's more mature I feel like a lot of
the epsy bags are geared toward a
younger audience where I feel like this
one is really classy and kind of sexy
you know it's it's really cute it's got
I'm not sure if you can see but it's got
a lace pattern here I think there's like
a I don't like a like a lighter maroon
shade behind it and then there's a
deeper maroon lace on there and of
course it's got epsy there and these
bags always feel very nice they really
make for people that don't get epsy they
make nice gifts because when you buy
something you can put them inside the
bag and use that as part of your like
wrapping of it and I've done that quite
often okay so this says spellbound you
get the card it says in my defense the
moon was full and I was left
unsupervised the leaves have turned the
air is cooler nightfall starts a little
sooner each day everything feels in
Chandon bubble
I always wish that they put the products
on the card but I know that's a lot of
extra work so you know
alright so Connie loved her bag this
month
that's awesome Julia says bye-bye poor
sample was broken there okay customer
service was amazing that's wonderful hey
Michelle how are you
Arwen says it has a little bag pulled it
so oh it does it does have a little bad
I didn't even notice that thank you for
pointing that out
Arwen okay so we've got the Smashbox a
lid primer I have never tried the
Smashbox lid primer course I've tried
the the face primer all like three
different kinds of face primer from them
not all of them but I've tried to quite
a few of them but I've never tried their
eyeshadow their lid primer so I'm very
excited to try this I think that's great
I'm happy to see that Leah says I want
to get a subscription box but I can't
decide which one girlfriend you just got
it look at the look at the unbagging and
see what they're offering and like
boxycharm you can see you can go if you
want to just get it in the glance you go
to the boxycharm website if you just
type in like boxycharm you know May 2017
it should take you to a page or you can
click on all of the boxes I'm not sure
if you can get to it from the pocket
your home page but you can get there
from like searching for a specific box
Elyse says Smashbox primer is my Holy
Grail oh that's awesome
okay so next we've got context vitamin C
all-day eye cream nice I'm about to run
out of my eye cream I've been using the
one from Juice Beauty and I really like
it a lot but I'm starting to run out of
it it's like down to like this much left
in the bottom and it's a pump so it's
kind of hard to get the remnants out of
the bottom but yeah so I'm excited to
have this I've never heard of the brand
context and it's a decent size I mean
for an eye cream this is gonna last like
three or four months at least maybe even
longer than that for half an ounce this
is gonna last a really long time so I'm
excited to see that let me see the
ingredients are ingredients on here yes
okay so I don't really see good
ingredients in here it's just a bunch of
fillers well that's a bummer
water butylene glycol cycle princess
locks i'm phenoxyethanol
i mean that's the preservative is
phenoxyethanol so anything after that I
usually just throw out the window I mean
there's some there's some stuff like way
way
but not even ingredients or poopoo on
this that's a bummer I was excited
Ashley says love you Jen love your
matey's all thank you so much I
appreciate that
jessica says Michaela how long have you
been on the boxycharm waitlist I don't
know how long people are on the box drum
weightless Makia says I hated to for a
play I did some floorplate for a month
or two and then something happened with
my billing and it ended up ended up
canceling and I just never redid it okay
this is the Luna by Luna Luna by Luna
and it says on the bottom olara ela RA
let's see what it is okay so what is a
lipstick crayon and this does look like
a color all wear so I will swatch this a
lot of times with my Ipsy 's recently I
haven't been keeping this stuff I've
been doing a like putting it in my
giveaway box for future for other people
but this is kind of a baby pink which I
think I'll use it feels very soft not
really a good scent it's a very makeup
being not good scent mmm yeah Wanda says
don't put poop on your eyes oh well yeah
the ingredients just there's nothing
good in here where is the good stuff
I mean soybean oil really that's it
that's all you got for me a Swabian oil
yeah I just I don't see grapeseed oil
Camilla sense asleep I think that's
green tea but it's like way down the
chest
horse chestnut seed but there's no like
hyaluronic acid or like anything good in
here who made this stuff whoo it's a
bummer okay and then one more thing
is that it so maybe the one maybe the
one thing was part of my bag that's all
that's in here oh this is the treat your
skin and trick your imperfections oh
it's from hey honey I like hey honey
trick and treat active propolis cream
concealer oh that's cool let me see the
shade Ashley's like wow soybean oil
that's not good I am with you let's see
ooh okay if see one thing I really like
about FC is that they
they do find out your shade and this
looks like this is gonna match me really
well very nice I love this okay it looks
really good and I love hey honey as a
brand I've tried quite a few products
from them and I'm really excited about
it
so mmm okay so it looks like this might
have been poor I'm very confused what
was part of my bag I'm gonna have to go
to the epsy website and be like what was
actually part of the bag there's only
four things in here and usually you get
five things so one of em mmm okay let me
just walk hold on a second time out I'm
going to their website to see if I
worked ever glambag okay you had the
bye-bye pores this was part of my glam
bag okay so this was part of it and this
I ordered with points so do I think this
was worth $10 now absolutely not I mean
unless except for the experience of
trying a couple of things like I'm
really excited to try this I've already
tried this before this is gonna go and
giveaway I'm really not excited about
this I'm this I'm like I'm gonna use it
but I can't seem excited especially with
the scent of it the scent does not smell
good to me and so they're really the
only two things I'm excited about are
these and to me this is not worth $10
this is worth maybe five or six dollars
so I'm not excited about this glam bag I
mean I'm happy to have it I don't feel
like I was ripped off but if I saw this
on the shelf for 10 bucks there's no way
I would buy it I am but my stomach it
like you would get that happy excited
feeling I am really excited about these
two products but I still don't think I'd
pay ten bucks for it that's my opinion
but let's see what everybody else is
saying and then we'll head out for the
day tortoiseshell cat says yeah my ex he
was a flat-out fail Jessica says I got
the Make Up For Ever foundation and I'm
getting to Sephora play two at least if
she gave me the correct shade yeah I'm
really excited about that I think that's
wonderful
hi Nancy Nancy's here malleus I got to
make up forever foundation nice hour one
says that's what I like about FC as long
as they listen to you yeah absolutely
Karen says I pay five dollars for the
bag well that's true I mean the bag too
wasn't thinking about that Karen is that
the bag is really really cute so I think
the back yeah I think Karen I think you
made a really good point I think
including the bag and the two products
that I like
I might pay $10 for it because the bag
is very nice do I need a bag like this
though I don't need it but it's super
cute
Michaela says I don't think five samples
is worth the $10 description that's the
reason I haven't subscribed well there
you go
Jen from indie Kitty one says I
cancelled everything Brenda canceled her
Sephora play Jennifer says how do you
notify that you're going live YouTube
does it I click a button that says
schedule next stream and then it's
supposed to be sent out sometimes I'll
put it up on Twitter I didn't this time
though I should do that though Amalia
says preferred perversion eyeliner you
got the perversion eyeliner on yours oh
that's cool
Shannon says I cancelled epsy getting
boxycharm now the only thing I hear
about people saying about boxycharm is
that it kind of gets overwhelming
because you get so many full-size
products that you can't use them up and
it's kind of like you get buried in
product and then you kind of have to
take a break
Kayla says I got the Urban Decay eye
liner pencil sample that's nice I like
the Urban Decay eye liner pencils
they're not my favorites I find that
they run down my eyes so I need to make
sure I use like a setting powder in
order to make it so that it doesn't run
Amalia says something about the boom
boom cream I really like that cream
alright I'm gonna go my Twitter jennifer
is just Jen Lowe's reviews and Jen laws
reviews everywhere generalise reviews on
snapchat Twitter and Instagram and and
periscope those are my four other social
medias that I use oh and Tabitha put it
in the Facebook group we do have a
Facebook group what's been makeup calm
no that's my website facebook.com slash
group slice what's up and makeup she put
up a notification in there as well
