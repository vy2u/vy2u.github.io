FC on bagging for December I am excited
to show you my FC bag as you can tell my
voice is a little bit off it was funny I
got a comment yesterday about my my
swatch voice being so different than my
regular voice and it was like I didn't
realize I was starting to get cold so my
voice is a little off and I tried to we
had some issues with the sound last time
I tried to find the sound settings again
and I can't find them so hopefully you
can hear me okay I'm gonna move my lav
mic a little bit further to the center
and then that way hopefully it's easier
to hear me I am getting ready to film
today I have the makeup minute then I'm
gonna take care of and of course my dog
wants to go out right now he can wait
ten minutes you'll be RIE
he just wants to go up to taste a bird
he was out like forever like mine
forever ago he was out like I don't know
30 minutes ago so he'll just he'll be
fine for me but anyway so yeah okay so
we've got an Ipsy bag I'm getting ready
to film that was where I was talking
about I'm getting ready to film I have I
haven't 100 as I decided what I'm gonna
film yet I'm still like I've got a
couple of ideas of things that I will I
need to film but it's just picking which
one because I'm prepared to film like
for videos but I can only pick two
I only have time for two so we'll see
what happens but anyway I stopped to do
my hair and I've changed my shirt for a
film anyway thank you guys so much for
being here if you're here alive I
appreciate you I'm just gonna say hi
real quick to the first people that were
here diaries of now Bell is here to have
a thought hello my friend and Tatiana is
here Ivana is here and Nelly is here and
psoriasis and I hope I said that right
Sarah Eve maybe it's gonna be wrong and
selling Nancy and Tam and kida and
Consuelo and stuff in Sandra and Andrea
thank you so much for being here and
Maria and Erica I hate having to stop I
could go on forever and ever say
people's names I do want to while I'm
getting this open let you know that I
just can't get as many videos up right
before Christmas I just
can't I I spent so much time on that bad
habit video that I might be able to get
one other video up this week other than
once it wondered what's up and make up
this weekend's but other than the make
up minutes and I'm gonna try to get one
more video up something just fell out
just happened I might be able to get one
more video out I'm gonna try but my
schedule is so off with all the holiday
stuff that's happening you know visiting
family and stuff like that it's just
been I've run out of time so just know
that I know I'm not on my regular
schedule but I'm trying really hard I
ordered this with Ipsy points and I'm
super excited about this this is naked
cosmetics it's darker than I thought it
was gonna be
I love naked cosmetics if you can ever
get these on a discount totally do
they're like have the least number of
ingredients of any eyeshadow I've ever
seen but they're amazing they're really
really good I'm gonna open this up I'm
excited for this this is in the shade
before I open it he5 oh this is one of
their heavy metals this is new you guys
know how much I love my foiled shadows
and my metallic shadows alright let's
see if I can get you oh it's not as
metallic as I thought it was gonna be
it's not metallic at all what is
happening here hopefully you can see it
that's like not even metallic is it cuz
it's not in the light I mean it's a
little metallic that's super
disappointing let me do a second swatch
ever top well I guess it's metallic
that's weak man it's not duo kronor
villanova unfortunately but I mean it's
a little metallic but I thought I was
expecting more from from this brand
because this brand is really good and
I'm very disappointed in this oh well so
now that I put my finger in and I have
to I'm gonna have to pass it on to
somebody else
cuz I'm probably not gonna use this
because it's not different enough from
things that I own and I'd rather pass it
on to someone that's actually going to
use it it's okay I mean it's pretty but
I already own stuff like that and I'm
never gonna reach this I'd rather have
another home I'm sad Gigi says thank you
for your excellent shop hush for
yesterday thank you so much I spent
about two weeks working on everything
my video forever oh my gosh like forever
it's all face thank you for liking my
makeup today I appreciate it
maybe some setting spray Geun Barry says
maybe hello I appreciate your comments
by the way I see your comments all the
time maybe but I'm it's not worth
working for it with me because I know
I'm not gonna use it since there I'd
already own things there's someone I'd
rather give to someone that has you know
can give it a better home alright so the
first thing I'm seeing well let me show
you the bag the bag is absolutely
adorable this is one of my favorite epsy
bags I've seen it's like a mint green
and it's got the sparkle at the top it's
super classy I really like this I would
actually use this as like a clutch going
to like a party where I wasn't trying to
look super posh but that is really
really cute this is probably my favorite
Ipsy bag of all time it's absolutely
adorable to me this bag is worth at
least eight bucks eight to ten bucks
just for the bag and usually I just kind
of like to have the bag and the bag out
of the bag but this one's really cute
now this kind of irritates me and let me
tell you why this irritates me this is
the Lisa Frank glamour dolls shimmering
eyeshadow I ordered the Lisa Frank
Kickstarter last October and I haven't
received a single thing from it not one
thing but yet they can put it in MC bags
which really makes me angry and I met
the people over at glamour dolls at
generation Beauty and they were talking
about how you know things are gonna be
coming out and I thought and remember
getting something that we've really had
a couple of items from it but I haven't
gotten that and I'm thinking you know
that they're probably trying to shave
but save on shipping that they don't
have all of the all of the things for
the order and they don't want to send
things out and multiple times cuz then
they're gonna lose money on all of that
shipping and I get that but I don't get
why this is being given for not for free
but for Ipsy customers when the people
who supported you and your Kickstarter
still haven't gotten their stuff that's
really flipping irritating to me you
know I know that the stuff has been up
for sale like I kind of get that but
like give the people that made this
happen for you there's stuff at least
something you know what I mean it just
that makes me entertain it but anyway
it's really excited about the Lisa Frank
stuff and you know I get to swatch it
now which is super cool I don't know I
guess if I do get this I don't remember
what I ordered
was well over a year ago if I do get
this I'll give away the eyeshadow that
comes in mine and I'll swatch this one
wow that actually feels really soft okay
so let me put that it's very nice and
I'm pretty sure these are like six bucks
they're not very expensive they're
really pretty that's very very pretty
it doesn't seem as I don't know let me
do a second swatch over top like it
doesn't have the opacity as some of my
favorites but it's still really pretty
and I love the Lisa Frank stuff that's
why I did the Kickstarter that was
actually with super Chat money back when
I did super chat I don't think I'm gonna
do super chat again I think I'm gonna
let it go I don't think I'm gonna bring
it back I was thinking about bringing it
back but I don't think I'm going to but
yeah I mean that's really pretty
if I hadn't ordered the Kickstarter and
still not gotten anything I would you
know I would be more excited about it
but I'm just stuck on my irritation but
that's really cool that's cool I
definitely think between the bag in this
were already at over ten bucks for me
alright Lodi London Lodi London I tried
there liquid lipstick and I hated it it
was so dry and awful like I think it
damaged my lips it was so dry this is a
blue nail polish by Lottie London it
says not for resale on the back um it's
in the shade riot let me see how it
looks I know I'm not supposed to shake
it but I can't swear puss here hello
hello it looks like it's pretty opaque
it looks like it's definitely gonna be a
one to two coat polish so that's really
cool Oh AJ says would totally give to
super chat again I just feel like you
know I want it I want it to be able to
do it I don't know super chats weird
that if you don't know what super chat
is it's when people in the community can
donate money to the channel so that like
a buy more products but honestly like I
feel like I'm doing fine right now like
I can buy my own products you know like
I thought it was really cool you know
people could contribute and have their
name scrolling on the screen and
I think that people like that aspect of
it you know that you know to know
they're consuming the channel but I
don't know it just saw my bad it just
doesn't feel right like it felt good
like okay in the moment but now like the
more I think about it the more I'm kind
of like yeah I don't really need it you
know what I mean like it feels it
doesn't feel quite right there's
something wrong with it
in my mind for me personally there's
something that's not quite clicking with
it all right this is the Luxy 239
precision shader brush this bag is
really good this bag is really good I'm
very excited about this bag Luxy brushes
are amazing I don't think I own this
Block C brush I own a lot of lucky
brushes because I get them in
subscription boxes I get them in um you
know again I got some for PR but I don't
think I own the shape this is really
tapered very low and Luxy brushes are
fantastic quality I'm very very excited
about this I love that the tapers are so
low so this is the 239 I took I already
have the 239 but it just looks different
for some reason this looks really cool
so yeah I'm already in like a total wind
state alright what is this this is
Sophia Isabel oh it's a perfume define
me Sophia Isabel fragrance oil let's
sing suit we got going on here AJ says
your bag Trump's mine that's well I'm
not that's not I'm glad for me I'm sorry
for you AJ I love you
AJ's one of our fabulous reporters
alright so here we go
mom 420 love beauty you got a great bag
oh you cancelled this month oh look it's
the stopper got stuck or is it supposed
to be like that I don't know I don't
think it's supposed to be like that I
think it's supposed to stay in the cap
alright let's smell this baby
hmmm the more I smell it the more it
smells nice let's put a little bit on
because it might smell differently once
I put it on it's definitely an oil I
feel the oiliness to it Deana says um or
is I'm gonna say Dina Dina says one of
my favorite subscription boxes is
fortune cookie soap seasonal box I've
heard
really good things about that I've never
gotten it before uh Nikki Murphy is here
hello my friend Nick Murphy I'm Nick
Murphy it smells really good
I like it now it's very fruity it smells
like no no it's only I was gonna say it
smells like something from Bath and Body
Works but it does smell a little more
perfuming it smells very nice it's very
fruity with a touch of floral which I
really enjoy out let me see what it says
it's supposed to be as far as the so
every bottle of defined me fragrance
represents mold breaking barrier
crushing them in that speak to the
qualities we strive for being comments
strong creative free spirited loving
passionate grateful and fearless for
every bottle purchase one dollar goes to
scholarships for girls that's cool the
sensor blendable that's really neat
Frank it's just made out of fragrance
and fractured fractionated coconut oil
so this is the thing is putting
fragrance and foreign coconut oil
directly on the skin I would imagine
that would be a problematic for some
people just because I mean I don't know
a whole lot about perfume and fragrance
hopefully someone in the collective
brain can educate me further on it I
will definitely do more research myself
but but I've heard putting it
concentrated fragrance on the skin may
not be a good thing but it does smell
really good it smells good
it just says Sophia as both doesn't say
like the notes or anything but that's
cool and then there's one more thing in
here this is alright if she just knocked
you have a park with this this is the
ofra long lasting liquid lipstick it's
the unzipped shade oh my gosh that's so
cool and it's such a pretty color Gigi
says my friend Nina ko open her boxes
last night and got a lot of different
things your box is much better oh man my
box is like crazy and they and I don't
think that they know like with my Ipsy
bag I don't think they send me anything
special like I don't think that they
know I mean I guess I do have my youtube
connected to my account I don't think
they big take the time to go through
honestly from what I know of epsy I
would doubt that they know they connect
my Ipsy bag with me making youtube
videos but that's really cool I'm
totally keeping this I love over liquid
lipsticks they're a little bit drying
but they remind me a lot of the dose of
colors ones in that they're not super
they're not so drying that they're
uncomfortable but they dry down
I think mostly mostly dry down not
completely I think they like had that
like going around the lips or whatever
that's so pretty oh my gosh that's
really cool so my Ipsy bag knocked I
mean this is this is probably the best
it's a bag I've gotten this year at
least if not longer so beautiful bag
love it love the over a liquid lipstick
really like the fragrance oil the scent
I absolutely love but I don't have to
look into putting fragrance and coconut
oil directly on everybody saying their
bag sucks cat says her bats bag sucks
and yummy Nicole's wasn't very good
either Charlie says in there okay she
said never tried them before I'm not
sure which one but good and Barry says
she got to face masks no no - off they
says I got the same one there's a 30%
off discount code on the tube oh really
oh yeah it says use code tips e34 30%
off on the bat so anybody can use that
though epsy 30 they have a lot of 30%
off said on Bopha that's cool though
simply Bonnie's as I put chapstick under
my OPA that's a great idea that's
awesome but yeah I mean the this
I don't really the nail polish I'm
probably not gonna wear I'll probably
pass it on to somebody a little where
the bloom Yash already overly nail
polish I don't really need any more blue
nail polish because I don't really wear
them that often
I'd be excited about this if I didn't
already buy it and they haven't said
it's me I'm a fragrance well like I said
I'm need to look into like as far as
putting fragrance on the skin like that
and I'm really excited about this so
this is to me is worth say eight bucks
18 23 33 38 38 bucks I wouldn't have
bought this 38 bucks for me personally
and I never I under I under us under put
my bag I got a fantastic bag I am so
thankful thank you FC I don't think it
was on purpose but thank you anyway
I appreciate it so much Valerie says my
last two bags are great I just took a
break this month I get name brands in
mine mine Plus that I ones that I never
heard of yet so Samantha says I'm so
shocked at Lisa Frank self me too I'm
really earth
