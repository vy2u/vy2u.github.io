another as I say welcome or welcome I
think I said welcome welcome to another
impromptu livestream I just do these
when I think I have something that I
want to show you and it's just kind of
random and it doesn't interfere with the
rest of my schedule so you know I'm
still gonna pop up the same number of
videos think of this as like a bonus
video so I got my Birchbox I stopped
getting it for a couple of months
because my credit card expired and kind
of slacked on getting another one I was
kind of like do I really need to get
Birchbox but then when my Ipsy video
people seem to really like my impromptu
unboxing of my Ipsy bags I figured well
I'll just research box and see if people
want to see what's in my Birchbox but
often tell you I haven't been super
impressed with Birchbox lately my
husband's food's ready I told him I'd
take care of that after I was done with
the live stream but yeah I mean Birchbox
used to be the king of subscription
boxes it was the the one it was the big
one the one that everybody got and you
know there were unboxings everywhere
from we're freaking out and then it just
slowly went downhill and this is what I
think my contact over there who was in
charge of social media she stopped
working for them she went to go work for
another company and after that it seems
like Birchbox just went she's like I
don't know if it was because of her
specifically like I don't know what else
was going on behind the scenes but they
completely stopped communicating with me
I don't have any other social media
people they stopped communicating with
but it was it was kind of hurtful almost
because we had been in such good
communication and they weren't sending
me the box or anything but they had
hooked me up with some products from
their Birchbox shop at one point and I
did a video for them it was not
sponsored but they had given me some
product to promote their Birchbox shop
and you know I just felt like we were in
a good place and you know then they just
dropped me out of nowhere so I was my
feelings were a little bit hurt so I
haven't really had any loyalty to
Birchbox for a while
but anyway so Birchbox is $10 a month it
is a makeup subscription it was one of
the first ones I remember this one and
beauty army
and then there was an allure beauty box
called sample society and those were
kind of the big ones back in the
beginning of subscription boxes beauty
subscription boxes that I remember this
is the box it says behind the scenes and
then it says Birchbox one thing out Oh
before I want to go one thing I wanted
to read was the very first comment in
here which I thought was really funny
Melissa says Birchbox sends the same
crap continuously their specialty is
what I like to call hashtag makeup for
ants and everybody in the comments so
far seems to be having the same kind of
experience with this where the samples
are just really small so I have no idea
what's in this let's go ahead and open
it and find out
so the first thing is a card it says
save the Holi day and it says our
holiday shop is launching November 2nd
and then there's a little bit of it's
like a like when you go when your kid I
don't know if you had these when you
were a kid when you went into like the
holiday shop at elementary school and
you know you went with your little list
of things to buy for mom and best bud
and brother and I should treat myself to
okay sure okay well go with it and then
I'm not gonna look at this yet that's
the card that says everything that's in
here and it says we're pulling back the
curtain on some of beauty's hard working
secret weapons then we'll keep you
looking your best at all full so the
first thing I see in here is a perfume
sample maybe it's not there anymore
it's empty okay this is the perfume
sample it is from la vanilla which I do
like vanilla vanilla and it's vanilla
grapefruit and hmm me put a little bit
on each side and then we'll smell it
give it a second and we'll smell it I
heard somewhere you're not supposed to
rub your your wrists together so I'm
trying not to do that because Posey it
crushes the notes it smells like vanilla
and grapefruit it's exactly what it
smells like I think it smells nice I
like it it's very tiny but I like it I
need $10 subscription for my $10
subscription okay then we have something
from derma e this is the nourishing rose
cleansing oil a little thing of that
which I do like derma e as a brand and
had good experience with them with
argan oil which are ingredients that I
like but as far as this being it's a
cleansing oil
I do wish it was just slightly bigger I
guess it is a sampling box so I'm even
thing is I'm used to boxing sharp at
this point you get those giant samples
but this is supposed to be a sampling
box so this is definitely a sample of
cleanser this cleansing oil might last
three or four uses which is what a
sample is for I guess you know but it's
a cleansing oil and it looks like it has
some good ingredients in it based on the
name but who knows as far as the actual
ingredients I have to look up the
ingredient deck to see if the jojoba and
argument wheel were high enough oft up
to be significant okay next up I got a
Clarins multi active new eat I don't
know what that is oh here we go
targets fine lines and it's a
revitalizing night cream so let's see
this Stacy says the foreplay isn't worth
the money and Jocelyn says that's my
favorite snap buy them
I was sent the vanilla coconut oh okay I
you know I like la vanilla as a brand I
actually got introduced to them through
subscription boxes and I've liked all
the cents I've gotten for them from them
except for one that was a little bit too
manly for me it was a little too deep
but they have a blackberry one that's
really nice I do like it as a whole it's
very sweet and very warm it's very
winter to me this one is the Clarence Oh
iris ed what it is is just a little a
little tiny one it's a point one ounce
and it doesn't say where it's supposed
to be applied I'll have to look it up
it's made in France it just it's a night
cream so I guess you put it all over
your face so Allison says I think the
Clarins item isn't almost every Ulta
sampler kit - good to know Vanessa says
hi hi to Vanessa and Britta says I love
your reviews thank you so much and Tanya
says this boxycharm look like it's gonna
be bomb yeah I haven't I haven't looked
at the sneak peak yet I haven't looked
yet
I'm taking this the biggest thing
outlast there is a big thing in here
there's a little baby sample of the
Estee Lauder pure color envy I hate
these samples oh my gosh these little
tiny things is like half it's gonna end
up staying on my finger this is a
lipstick sample Wow
yeah yeah
listed on the card I hope not oh it's a
bonus it's considered a bonus and then
the Clarins is considered a bonus as
well okay so but you know putting a
lipstick in something like this is just
it's gonna stay on my lip on my finger
instead of my lips and I guessing you're
gonna ply it with a lip brush it's
probably the smart way to do it it's
shade a45 envious but I can't say I'm
excited about that okay and then this oh
no this was this Clarins looks like it's
not me this one is the is actually
supposed to be in here but this one is
the sample won the bonus this is the
double serum and it's got two turmeric
in it which is supposed to be a really
really good ingredient but who knows
where is on the ingredient list but
that's I don't mind the skincare things
in these packets as much as I care about
like lipstick I think that's kind of
crazy
yeah da Meno says use the brush for a
lip sample yes I think that's a great
idea okay so you know this I'm curious
to try we'll see how it goes
it looks like I might get one use out of
that and then this is the big thing in
here this is the Dro hair wellness
well-being treatments luxe leave-in mask
I do love hair masks my hair is very
thin it's very I was not blessed with
good hair so hair masks are essential
for me for looking like I have in any
way decent hair so oh look totally just
looped on my nose that's not good as a
nice light fresh kind of scent to it
divinity says at least the foil packs
are a bonus I agree if they were
actually I was just watching the replay
of this getting on my nose but yeah I'm
excited to try this
it is a 1.75 ounces so let's look and
see what the value is so that's
everything we've got the double yeah the
duro luxe leave-in mask this is a
full-size and it's $29 so I I can't
believe this is a full-size because the
hair mask typically is a lot more
product than this but they say it's a
full-size at $17.99 so this would pay
for the price of the ball
if it is good we will see we will see
we've got the bonus items of the Estee
Lauder lipstick and the double serum
high hydric and lip picked system I'm
curious to try that because I do like
turmeric as an ingredient from what I've
researched and then we've got the face
cream the night cream the full size of
this is $57 for the full oh no wait hold
on a minute
that's not wait wait I just realized
they all say full-size and that's not
full sauce okay this is not a full-size
I don't think see it doesn't say how big
the full-size is that triki triki
Birchbox
yeah I don't know how big the full-size
is but the full size of this is $29 not
$17.99 it's $29 for the full-size but I
don't know what size this is and then
the full size of this is 57 full-size of
the derma e is the $17.99 and I was miss
reading that and then the full size of
the love vanilla is between nineteen
dollars and forty eight dollars so
there's no way to tell from the card
what the retail price is of the box I'm
actually gonna look up this DeVoe real
quick and see because I'm very curious
what size the full size is okay we'll go
to the Birchbox website oh wait that's
the split and repair hold on a minute
there it is $29 it does have woah it's
got five looks like four and a half
stars with 705 reviews for this so
that's pretty cool that's nice and it
says a full-size is 200 milliliters and
of course this isn't listed in
milliliters what is going on Oh 200
grams the website says 200 milliliters
but then the bottle on here says 200
grams 7.05 ounces so this is a quarter
of a full size so that would make this
what's 30 / 4 29 / 4 4 8 12 16 20 24 28
so about $7 product here ish $7 ish so
that's kind of cool I mean this is if
this is as good as everybody says it is
on the Birchbox website then this will
definitely make
the price of the box because then these
would be oh no there's something else in
here I missed something okay this is the
Aiko skinny liquid eyeliner in black I
do really like the Aiko skinny liner
I've tried this before it is very good
it does smudge on me though I did not
see that somehow I missed it the full
price of this is $22 so I do think this
is worth $10 if this is a good product
so from first impression I would say
this is worth $10 just for these two
products because it is a good product
you just have to be careful not to rub
it during the day and then I do like the
la vanilla perfume this looks like it
has some good ingredients and the night
cream I think it's worth 10 bucks
is it worth well over 10 bucks no oh
think so but you know I am happy with
this Birchbox I have to say I'm happier
with this than I am with other ones Stef
says don't use the Aiko fat liner I
totally agree I don't like that one
either I am with you da Meno says I am
loving if see and place so far but I'm
pretty happy paying two dollars a sample
the value of my last at 2 FC bags were
40 to 50 dollars and he says another
black eyeliner I know but that's what
people wear so I guess they're trying to
meet the needs of multiple people
because they were probably if it was
purple or something people say why am I
getting these weird colors you know what
I mean
Christine says I do love that Aiko about
$22 Kat Von D is 20 and actually does
stay all day I agree
but I'm happy to have the sample and I
will probably put this in a giveaway in
the future because it is a pretty good
liner and I have tried it before so I
don't really need it so it probably
hadn't been giveaway I am going to try
this I am starting a new skincare
routine because I have my Det beste damn
Beauty skincare video coming out
tomorrow so I have to put that stuff
away and I'm starting a new skincare
routine and I cannot tell you the name
of the brand it is a smaller brand that
I wanted to highlight because the
ingredients looked really good it is not
sponsored but they did send me the
products so that's what I'm starting
next so I don't know if I'm actually
going to try these or not because I
don't want to mess with the rest of my
routine the cleansing oil actually I'll
probably use just because I don't have a
cleansing oil I don't think from that
from that line that they said but we'll
see
and we'll look at the chat real quick
and then we'll go ahead and go for the
day
beautifully ageless says I'm not
impressed lol at was stupid box of
Charmin EPS Iain &amp;amp; Co says his Michelle
Phan officially away from Ipsy now that
is what they say if see I don't think
has made an official announcement but on
their website they talk about her in the
past tense so to me that is a an
announcement at least I haven't seen an
announcement by Ipsy that she's not a
part of it anymore but it has been in
multiple news sources that I've seen
Jackie says your collection looks
amazing thank you so much we're gonna be
talking about that with the best day of
beauty stuff it's a nice line it's a
really nice line we'll talk about it on
Friday
Jordan says I love samples but this has
not impressed me sticking to boxycharm
yeah bye auntie charm is definitely a
better value definitely but I'm not
hating on this this is not I'm not
hating on it and I think that if I
didn't want this the hair mask then I
would be disappointed but I think this
really makes it for me at least Michelle
says I dumped epsy it was the same thing
over and over again Christine says oddly
enough the best things I got from
Birchbox is the we wave spray and the
red bottle leave-in conditioner which I
don't remember the name of it's probably
the beauty what do they call it I know
what you're talking about though it
smells really good
what's there leave it alone I mean I got
to find it leave-in conditioner it'll
pop up beauty something it's a red
bottle I know exactly what you're
talking about it to find it oh come on
it's a force it's not going to show it
when I type in it show it beauty
something somebody's probably typing it
right now oh there it is Beauty
protector that's what it's called Beauty
protector alright I'm gonna go ahead and
pop off here but thank you so much for
