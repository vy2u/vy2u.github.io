impromptu livestream we've got some
better lighting than the last livestream
that I had to hit like this but it's not
terrible it's okay
anyway I caught this I'm excited about
this my friend Nancy was kind enough to
send this to me and I'm super excited to
swatch it for you
it is the Kat Von D shade + light eye
glimmer palette this is the outer
packaging right here and then hello
everybody and then we've got the outer
box there where it's got all of the
shades but of course there are some
glitter going on some glitter going on
in here and I'm curious about the
fallout and what's gonna happen with
this I'm hoping to do a full review on
this eye shadow palette when I get back
I am leaving for Iceland next Thursday
with my family we're supposed to go to
Brazil but it didn't work out to go to
Brazil the tickets were too expensive so
now we're going to Iceland so I won't be
in town for a while but I did want to
show you this before I go because I'm
not gonna get a chance to film a full
video so we're gonna do finger swatches
we're gonna do brush swatches and I'm
gonna give you kind of my first
impression just from the swatches and
then hopefully do a full review when I
get back I also have a full review when
I get back of this baby that Nancy again
was kind enough to send me Nancy's like
my guardian angel if you don't know her
she's my guardian angel if makeup she
sends me gifts sometimes since she's
amazing so she sent me this one this is
the cool toned one we both noticed that
there was a lot of reviews on the warm
tone one and I'm personally just me
personally getting a little tired of all
of the warm pallets because I've bought
quite a few so I kind of feel like I
don't really want to do more warm right
now like I'm kind of done with it for
the moment you know even if you eat
something you know that's a lot you
really really love it like sometimes you
get a little tired of it you know it's
something you really really enjoy so
that's what we're gonna be doing next
time but let's go ahead back to this one
thing I want to mention is that I love
the mirror and how it's got like this
design here I think is super super cool
Tammy says she feels the same thing
about the colors oh by the way this is a
live chatter I'm going to be
to the people a little bit that are here
so if that bothers you I'm really sorry
but I'm gonna be talking a little bit
about what they think as well
I like the warm colors but sometimes I
just get you know I love chocolate but I
don't eat chocolate all day every single
day well maybe not chocolate chocolates
not a good example fried chicken I love
me some fried chicken I love fried
chicken but I do not want fried chicken
every single night you know what I mean
ah Sanders Kennedy up in the house
what's up haven't talked to him forever
how you been
Jamie says cool tones are more
flattering on her skin tone and she'll
sing so true and Cindy says look up with
glasses thank you I've had these for a
hot minute mole loves makeup says velvet
59s rose metal pallidus cool tone and
beautiful I wasn't the biggest fan of
that one I did do a raffle review of
that and I wasn't it was just okay for
me I don't know it was something about
it that just struck me as I don't know I
wasn't a big fan okay here are the first
four shades we're gonna do these four
top three and then we're gonna do this
one over here Shannon's here I love warm
times at me to some cool tone sometimes
okay we're gonna go here and we're just
gonna swatch finger swatch mmm I'll
leave a little space and then we'll go
down and I do have arm hair of course
you don't have hair on your lid so
that's gonna make a difference okay try
to get that light off of here actually
let me see if I turn off this unnatural
light and see if the sunlight will help
yellow let's see if they see that I
think looks better that's more natural
rather than having this bright home
lighting on there so we've got this one
they're all supposed to be shimmery but
I feel like this one right here this
light shade is definitely more of a
satin which I think was a really good
move because I feel like you want
something to blend out your brow bone
you may not want a big bright like
glittery mess like up here you know
Thank You ro and she likes my glasses
too this one has a nice shimmer and
shift I'll look at the names so this one
was called porcelain and this one is
called Oh her font kills me every time I
think it's dusk I think that says dusk
see that letter right there I don't know
if it's backward or forward but her
letter
every time I think it's a dusk I make
sense with the coloring of it this one
is called dune and this one is called
copper so let's go ahead and go into
some brush swatches I brought a couple
different brushes I wasn't sure it was
gonna work so we're gonna go ahead and
start with this one it's just a regular
packing brushes by a brand called
Michael Markus but you know it's just a
brush brush so let's go ahead and we'll
dip into the first one which is
porcelain and we'll just swatch that
right there I have no primer on my arm
and some some palettes I'm finding
really need a primer in order to have
lasting power even on the arm like when
I do the wipe test I think I'm gonna
start using primer from now on but I did
not do a primer for this I wasn't
thinking so so the brush swatch is very
light but that'll be nice for blending
out the brow bone I'm excited about this
Jenna says she made a brush just for
this palette also hey Jenna what does it
look like is it flat like this one or is
it fluffy like this one because I'd
rather use whichever one is the one that
she recommends you know what I mean that
was just the first one and let's go into
the second one the reason why I'm
picking this one is they don't seem very
foiled and I feel like this kind of
brush works better for like a foiled
shadow and this works better for like a
shimmer and a satin so let's watch this
one okay it's fluffy okay awesome thank
you okay so not a whole lot of
pigmentation there but again you know
it's gonna be different on the eyes most
likely and I already have shadow on my
eyes so yeah I don't know okay let's try
this one I feel like on my arm I'm not
really like I might I think I'm gonna
switch it I think I'm gonna go this way
instead because I feel like there's
something going on here here let's just
do this last one and then we're gonna
switch the inside of the arm instead
we'll do some finger swatches on the
inside and see if that helps because
this is not really working very well on
my outer arm I was trying to do it was
best for you guys but it's not really
working right for the swatches and I
don't know if it's doing them justice
and I want to make sure I'm being fair
so let's go ahead and we're gonna redo
these on the inner part of my arm cuz I
really want to lease assess the egg is
way to go on eighty thousand subscribers
thank you I don't feel like I did
anything with the 80,000 that's other
people's choices not mine
I just create the content people come or
they don't you know what I mean okay so
let's go ahead and do the inner and side
part of the arm instead okay and then
this one here I still feel like they're
kind of coming out the same I don't feel
like there's that much of a difference
hmm but maybe on the eyes they'll be
better I don't know but they still don't
look like they're not punching me in the
face you know what I mean like I wanna I
shadow to punch me in the face and be
like just I'm right here did you you
know BAM maybe I need a primer maybe I
do
should I maybe I'll go upstairs and get
a primer cuz I want to be fair so I'm
gonna bring you with me if you're if you
get upset or if something happens when a
camera shakes this camera's about to
shake so don't look cuz I don't want to
hurt anybody okay so let's go ahead oh
thank you Joanna said I'm honest and I
forgot what else she said but it was
really nice okay I'm gonna take you guys
upstairs with me and we're gonna go get
a primer and if you see mess in my house
I'm really sorry I never a live stream
like this through my house this is the
first time you guys have seen on YouTube
my house like this so let's get a primer
and I'm gonna get my towel so I can wipe
off okay so should we go let's go for
Urban Decay's Eden okay I wish I could
take it off and put on my eyes you know
why I'm testing the Jaclyn hill palette
on my eyes today so I can't do both okay
and then I want my towel here's my towel
okay so let's go head back down okay you
know you're glad Sephora canceled the
order yeah and you guys I don't know if
you know this about me but I love Kat
Von D eyeshadows and that's why I'm like
oh no this is not something's wrong here
something's not going right it doesn't
look great shame shame you have to use a
primer for the whole palette yeah see
that's what I'm thinking and one thing
just does a little sneak peek with the
Jacqueline Hill palette it needs a
primer you have to have a primer for
lasting power for pigmentation like that
palette real
needs a primer okay so let's go ahead
I'm gonna flip you
okay now you're a stable so if you're
the person that doesn't like things to
be shaky you're back to being stable now
so you can look again okay
love that you're going extra mile for us
of course I want to make sure I'm
accurate you know what I mean and this
is a first impression so we want to make
sure we have the best possible so I'm
gonna take this out and I'm actually
going to take this I'm gonna squeeze a
little bit on my arm and when you see
the Jacqueline Hill swatches which will
hopefully be up as soon as possible I'm
gonna split it into two things I do use
this primer on my arm for the whole time
okay so what I'm gonna do I think what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do finger
swatches of everything and then we'll do
brush swatches of everything and that
way we can go a little fast because this
video is gonna be really long we're
already at nine minutes okay so let's go
ahead we're gonna do these again they
feel like they remind me a lot of the
way the who was that palette but not the
serpentina what was the purple palette
there was one that had a lot of grays
and purples in it it feels like that it
doesn't feel like like the holiday
palettes and things okay so I have put
the Eden on my arm and we are definitely
getting better pigmentation check it out
definitely definitely better chrysalis
palette thank you so much Jennifer you
are awesome
Jennifer's my friend that I met in Texas
I'm I meet up last year okay hold on a
minute I just got some look and I just
did to my lighter shade I totally just
got Brown it that was my porcelain my
porcelain is no longer porcelain it's
like dusty Brown oh well that was my
fault
okay much much better okay so now let's
go into bronze this is bronze something
with this closer this is sterling they
feel very powdery to touch they feel I
can feel the powder this one is called
cinder and this one is onyx these first
two felt very powdery okay let's try it
primer definitely making a difference
there okay okay now we're getting
pigmentation now we're getting it okay
we see in the shimmer there I hope so
try to get it nice and close there we go
you guys can really see and so far I'm
really liking that it's more cool
because like I said I'm really enjoying
the cool tone jail it lately Emily says
love watching you thank you so much and
hello to Mallory the black is a the
black is black and it's got glitter in
it I don't know if you can see that you
know what I'm gonna open my curtains a
little bit hold on a second okay and by
the way um and now our names going out
of my head the artist for this I always
get asked what the artist is and now I
can try a Koopman kaya Koopman is the
artist there in case you're curious so
there we go so now the window is open a
little bit more let's get you real close
we're not quite done yet let's just
finish them and then we'll get close
okay where did I stop the black
okay last four we have glacier which
also feels powdery
Ross feels very buttery Jasper feels a
little powdery and quartz feels very
powdery so there's definitely multiple
formulas going on in this thing okay
let's keep going
BAM okay
now I don't have primer down here I
didn't go that far and I'm starting to
see a pigmentation difference where I
don't have the primer I only took the
primer to about here
I don't think I brought it that far so I
think that's making a difference okay
does it has it compared to the metal of
the metal matte formula I feel like some
of them feel like it I definitely felt
like that rust shade this one right here
is that buttery that buttery feeling I
don't know if I'm gonna wet them for
this I think I'm gonna test them wet cuz
I think that that would take a really
long time for me like wet my brush wipe
it off wet my brush Wyatt wipe it off
and I feel like I just want to do dry
brush swatches for this but remember
we're gonna do full review when I get
back from Iceland so are these too
shimmery for everyday wear I would
imagine that what I will plan on doing
this for like everyday wear would be to
pair this with a matte palette except
for these right here are satin they're
not super punchy so Emily wants to know
Jacqueline Hollister for pro I haven't
even touched the support Pro yet so I
have no idea no idea this one I would
think it really is gonna be I don't own
the original shade light but really for
this just from glancing at it if you're
looking at the original shade + light
eye palette which I don't own or this
one the original one is all matte this
one is got has the satins and the
shimmers in it it's really what your
personal preference is and what you own
a lot of you know if you don't own a
matte all matte neutral palette then
that's something that you would want to
reach for I do have a problem is it X X
Co X I can't even pronounce that but
anyway she said he or she said that um
you know she doesn't see this as being a
standalone palette I think that's what
she just said my brain is going a mile a
minute
and I don't know I don't know I'm not
sure I think that's what she just said
it's so funny like I read it and then I
was thinking and then I forgot it
already
so Amanda says I hear the Sephora Pro is
a super powdery Masson
I don't have the original shade lighter
also I would compare them both but I
don't have it and I'm kicking myself and
the reason why is somebody told me they
were gonna get it for me as a gift
because I had gotten them a gift and
they were gonna get it for me as a gift
and then it never came which was fine
because the gift was a gift I wasn't
expecting anything in return but I never
bought it because I was kind of waiting
for her to give it to me and then she
never did okay so now we're gonna go
ahead into the brush swatches Stef says
the pro the support Pro shades aren't
terrible that's good to know
okay and we're gonna coat that so it's
got plenty of powder on there and then
we're gonna actually here you know what
I'm gonna have to do it on this arm
because I'm out of room on this arm
I didn't leave space okay here we go I'm
gonna spread that all over I'm gonna
spread it all the way down this now I
know I need to do all the way down
comparable to lorac but more powdery
they're definitely different lorac is
more buttery where these are more like
there's a grit to it there's like a when
the rocks powder up they're soft powder
these are like gritty powder you know
okay so anyway
hopefully I can do this left-handed I'm
right-handed okay oh my gosh this is
gonna be a mess look at that I can't
even see it okay let's try the other
brush let's use the flat brush and see
if that helps
I really am rooting for this palette but
I don't see it oh I think that's left
over from another swatch look there's
blue there that is not that is not
correct erase erase erase erase erase
that is not correct no as far as falling
out um I do have some dust here I don't
I haven't put on my face yet so I don't
know about true fallout but if you look
where I dug my brush in do you see how
there's some powder there and there's
some powder over here on this one so I
don't know we'll see we'll see what
happens when I actually wear it on the
eye okay well I'm gonna give up on that
first shade and again I'm gonna try on
my actual eye and it might be different
we don't know that because I am like
I've I I'm not accepting that this is
not a good palette I'm not accepting it
I just try to pack it
I'm like come on come on cat come on
cats it's like are you serious okay I
don't know if this is permanent I'm not
really sure you love the chats
oh I'm so glad okay we're gonna try this
one this is called dune mmm can you see
I don't know I don't know is this the
first shade matching your skin is that
why you can't see it maybe that might be
part of it that might be part of it and
it's more of a matte so I mean if you
look at it that's a finger swatch of it
next to my skin finger swatch next to my
skin here so maybe that might be it
I could foil it but I don't want to make
this video an hour long so it's gonna be
in the final video when I do like the
full review I'll put I'll do some wet
swatches for you so this is copper I
just have to remember that I said I was
gonna do that okay this is copper guys
I'm gonna keep moving over here oh
that's nice that one's going on very
nicely I like that one that one's nice
Amir Ali says she's gonna pass yeah I
haven't seen you in forever oh no I
forgot to plug my phone back in I had it
charging and then I forgot to plug it
back in when I came back home on a
second jeanette says she's gonna pass -
mmm maybe it's meant to be packed on
sheila says I'm trying to pack it as
best as I can onto my arm I'm gonna
swipe and then pack okay so there's a
swipe and this this one looks nice like
that that's good and then let's pack
that one this one's really dusty like
look see how it's powdering up pretty
bad this was one that felt kind of
gritty on the finger okay let's pack it
oh sorry I keep forgetting cuz I'm on
the wrong arm here yeah I don't know I
don't know okay
okay let's do this light shade this is
that silver one this is called sterling
hopefully I don't have any Brown in this
I tried to wipe it off on my towel
let's try to pack it I definitely still
have some brown in my brush click and
see it getting in the shadow come on
baby come on
hmm they're definitely not they're not a
foiled formula you know there's so many
foiled formulas coming out and I think
we're getting used to this punchi punchi
foil and that is not what this is so
there are gonna be people who really
really like this because it's not a
punchy foil not everybody wants to be
punched in the eye like I do you know
what I mean
Krista says of how its way to do before
they be this black looks pretty unique
then next one I'm about to show you this
is called onyx you can see I'm trying
really hard to love this oh okay what's
going on nice with a brush it might be
the brush it's possible and again this
is right out of the box so I'm gonna be
playing with this a lot before the full
review this is just the first impression
it totally could be the brush you know I
go through a big process when I do
reviews so oh these here underwhelmed by
the swatches v says V dreamcatcher one
of my favorite channels alright let's
try that one again this is the this is
called glacier I hope that packs on the
lid nicely it's not packing on my arm
nicely pack pack pack pack pack come on
baby come on
mm mm okay let me switch let me switch
brushes let's go over to this one this
one's a little bit maybe some fix+ yeah
V and I think I might do that for the
full review we're gonna go into glacier
again with a thicker more dense brush
and see if I can get this to really pop
it's just not it's not popping I can see
it hey fizzy pop with or some NYX
glitter glue yeah but the thing is is
these pallets are expensive enough I
kind of feel like they really should
just perform you know does it glitter
disappear in the black shadow when you
swatch it with the brush
ah yes no it's still there but not
nearly as much as the finger swatch the
finger swatch is definitely there well
maybe even not I don't know I think it's
one of those blacks where you if you
want the glitter to show up you're gonna
have to put it all over your eye okay we
got three more this is rust this one's
watching really nicely that one's what
I'm looking for very nice a flatter
denser and brush let's try it okay you
know we'll do we'll try the flatter
denser brush in a minute okay let's just
keep with the fluffy ones okay this
one's Jasper I do feel like it's going
on better with this one then the thicker
one this is Jasper and I definitely have
some puff see that that just puffed off
but it also didn't tap my brush off so
that could be just operator error okay
and then ya ve said she was expecting to
be like Natasha de no no it's not no way
this one's really foiled looking in the
pan this is the last one it's called
quartz it's really foiled looking in the
pan mmm-hmm can't really see okay let's
just bring you guys real close real
up-close and personal
I know where is it it's making me sad I
want it to be so much better but again I
haven't put it on my eyes yet it's just
first impressions okay I want to try
some of these ones that were weak I want
to try this last one quartz that's
supposed to be beautiful I'm gonna put
on the back of my hand with the
colour-pop brush this is one of those
flat see how skinny and flat it is okay
I'm gonna go this way so that I can see
what in the world I'm doing that's the
second swipe I'm just it's kind of a
small brush so I want to make sure I'm
doing everything I can
that's what the colour-pop brush the
flat one so the packaging is pretty he's
like hey at least the packaging is
pretty yes the packaging is pretty I
mean it's there it's just it's not a
foil palette
just not foiled let's try again the
glacier one the white one with the
colour-pop brush and I'm again I'm gonna
go this way but you guys can see that
I'm really doing it that's one swipe of
the colour-pop well one dip into the
product with the colour-pop hmm okay it
looks like we're getting the same thing
just slightly different shade you see
don't they look almost exactly the same
like this one's slightly Pinker look
almost like exact same thing the palette
is limited-edition Natalie says I did
not know that okay um okay well any
other suggestions that I can do because
I mean I can I can go ahead and I don't
have anything to spray the brush right
now although it's all the way upstairs I
can like outright wet the brush Oh -
Cassie's here mine is supposed to come
today fingers crossed that this palette
is awesome but you don't seem too
impressed yes right now I'm not like
there is an audience for this I feel
like there is an audience for this and
it's people that want just a shine just
a little bit of shine I do have sponge
tip applicator x' but they're upstairs
so yep Cassie friend Ricky's here my
friends are all showing up became
Sanders came Cassie came and all my
other friends who don't make videos are
here Amy's here mac's fix+ I have it
upstairs should I go get the mac fix+
work 24 minutes should I get it okay
let's get it because okay let me give
some final thoughts of how I feel right
now in case you're already bored and you
want to be done then I'll tell you right
now I feel like there's an audience for
this I feel like it's gonna be for
people that like some shine but don't
want that explosion of pop that's kind
of the way that I'm feeling right now I
feel like it might be best paired with
another palette what's up baby oh you're
gonna go get it for me I don't even know
where it is sweetheart that's very nice
and you though I love you so much if I
knew exactly what to tell you to get and
where it is I would tell you to go get
it that is so nice my five-year-old just
wanted to go get it for me isn't that so
nice so anyway I just I feel like that
this isn't as poppy and punchy as I
thought it was gonna be that's all all
right so that's my thoughts right now
but I'm gonna go get some fix+
so we're gonna go ahead and unplug you
again and we're gonna take
trip upstairs nice of him sweet
you doing okay over there buddy yeah do
you want to say hi do you want to say hi
real quick do you want to say hi hi
there okay all right so let's go up and
let's go get the fix+
let's do it cuz if y'all want to see it
I'm just sitting here my son and my son
my daughter and my husband went to yoga
so they're gone so it's just me and my
son we just got back from my parents
house and yeah let me um okay it's in
one of these two drawers I'm not sure
which one I found the make up for
everyone
there's the make up for everyone if we
get a pinch and I can't find the fix
plus because that happens sometimes
because sometimes I go too fast and I
put things in the wrong place and then I
lose it okay cuz I can get a little
scatterbrained hmm okay last place I can
look is here okay how do you guys feel
about me using them the makeup forever
mist and fix is that the same thing or
is that too different and we need fix
plus what do you think do we have to
have fixed glass oh ha fix plus I found
it okay we're gonna do fix plus I found
it I have to tell you the story though
okay cuz my son will be embarrassed as
well he won't be embarrassed but he
doesn't like me talking about him so the
other day you see his hair his hair is
like super long I told his dad I was
like you've got to go to take him to get
his haircuts he's like alright so he
said okay buddy we're gonna get your
haircut and he's like I want to get my
haircut and he's like we gotta get your
haircut but he's like I don't want to
he's like it's my hair I should be able
to do what I want with it
and and my husband was like well don't
you want to get cut he's like no it's
not bothering you any it's it's not you
know it's not gonna hurt you that my
hair is long it's my hair so he didn't
take him to get his hair cut it's like
fair's fair point you don't have to get
your hair cut then I thought that was
really smart of him no he was like cuz
my hair's not hurting you
well I guess I'm not getting a haircut
then alright
okay we're bringing the fix+ down we're
gonna do this we're gonna do this
walking through my kitchen you colored
your bangs against your mom's wishes oh
my gosh okay so so what we're gonna do
okay well first of all let's see if
let's do a little wipe test okay I'm
gonna go like this
this is whip primer okay and then we'll
do this side this is with primer as well
from the brushes so lasting power
doesn't look it's gonna be a problem
with primer at least for the deeper
shades the lighter shades are kind of
gone now I just have like a mist of
she's like a shimmery I'm gonna make
sure you guys are straightened I thought
like a shimmery bit there okay so let's
wipe off my hands let's put a little
should we do primer and fix+ let's do
both okay okay so there's primer okay
and then okay we're gonna get out the
brush which brush should I use which one
should I use the flat one or should you
use the fluffy one
what are we think oh plug my phone back
in thank you is it male or molé molé a
I'm gonna say male like chocolate mole a
flat brush everybody's sayin flat brush
alright let's do it everybody this is
why I like doing it with you because you
have the best opinions okay so we're
gonna dip it in let's do a really
shimmery one first let's go backward to
forward okay so we're gonna start with
quartz okay we're gonna go this way
because the shimmery ones are on the
bottom so we're gonna start here and
we're gonna go backward through the
palette everybody sand flat and you guys
are so funny okay so I'm gonna go like
this
got powder there and we're gonna spritz
OH
oops if it's open okay and then we're
gonna go like these
hmm looks the same okay well let's try
another one let's try the next one this
is called Jasper okay and let us spritz
let's put a little make sure that little
bit more let's make sure it's nice and
wet okay it just looks like a wet
version of it right am i right what is
going on here it looks the same okay
let's try the next one this one is
called rust I'm wiping it off on my
towel in between by the way rust okay
there's the pigment on there we're gonna
give it a spritz make sure it's nice and
wet okay I don't want any excuse for
this not to work okay that's a little
better but that one swatched better with
a brush that one fingers watched better
the sun's starting to go down the Sun is
not being my friend right now let's get
it nice and close I don't get it too
close so I wanted to focus okay
wet at first and then see the the what
I've learned is if I wet it first and
then dip it in then I ruined my shadows
because it leaves a mark in my shadow so
I've found that this is a way for the
shadow to get wet without without
getting it in the wet in the product as
much and the brush is still a little bit
wet as I put it into the product I can't
completely put it you know dry
completely because it's just a towel but
okay I mean what is that what even is
that what is happening here what is that
that's glue sure is what that is let's
I'm gonna put it on my finger and show
you the finger swatch next to it that's
the finger squash that's the wet brush
swatch so looks like we're gonna have to
be applying these with our fingertips if
we want that full pigmentation cat it's
very rare that I'm disappointed by a kat
von d palette but I have to tell you I'm
kind of disappointed in this I
I've tried I mean I will be happy to try
anything you guys think would be good
I'll try this is onyx we're gonna try
the black and I know people love the
black I made sure this was super wet
maybe I'm wetting it too much see look
it's just watering it down you see how
it's like it's like sheer now with the
water yeah Carol says I don't judge my
swatches anymore I get how they applied
to the eye I am totally with you on it
and that's what we're gonna do for the
full review so there you go I mean this
this is not good with the with the water
it's worse it's worse I'm gonna wipe it
off the black off the colour-pop brush
and then I'm gonna put it back in is dry
a little bit drier and you see it this
is the dry and this is the wet I think
he says my suggestion is return it oh
well you know I definitely recommend you
watch other videos wait until I get home
from Iceland so I can do a full review
try the fluffy brush I did the whole
full swatches with the fluffy brush
though you might wet fluffy we'll try
wet fluffy in the black wet fluffy so
we're gonna go like this
I mean I'll do anything you guys want me
to wet fluffy wet fluffy go go wet
fluffy go wet fluffy go before you go
I mean it's just watering it down like
it seemed it's like literally seems like
its watering it down it's not that's not
good
okay are we good do we feel like we've
got a good place or do you I find a lot
of kickback there is some powder there
is definitely some powder kicking up
with some of the shades but not all of
them try them that way I can do that
well none of them are matte they're
close to matte though they're like a
satiny kind of color kind of finish yeah
okay so let's go ahead and we're gonna
put in that very first one which is
porcelain and this is the way that it
looks on the brush okay and then we're
gonna do the wet it just disappeared on
the brush look see how it chunked it up
hmm it doesn't feel like urban decay
credit feels like its own special grit I
might still have some black on that
brush there might still be some black
because it's wet and I can see that
might not be a good one
so yeah okay give up Mariana says give
it up guys it sucks oh thank you so much
while I tried I try my best and again
I'm not calling it quits on this yet I
am NOT writing it off and I think that
we need we definitely need to play with
this more I definitely don't recommend
you run out and get it without seeing
more positive experiences with us
because right now I cannot give this a
positive for people like really bright
stuff so you know no crap is rotten cats
grabbing a rotten tomatoes to throw out
the palette I'm sorry I'm very sorry oh
it's no problem well I hope that I hope
it works better on the eyes next up on
the channel is gonna be a tutorial kind
of thing for like a beginner type
tutorial kind of thing and then I've got
swatches at the Jaclyn hill palette
coming up before I leave
and hopefully boxycharm and cross my
fingers and ishani from total makeup
junkie 101 sent me her liquid lipstick
collection so I'm waiting for her to
give me the go-ahead to do a video on
those so hopefully those will be the
four videos that go up in the next week
so not sure when the next live stream
will be I don't know I'm not sure should
I do a live stream on this on the
Sephora Pro maybe I will maybe I'll do a
live stream on this for pro doing the
same thing and we'll see how that goes
but I'm not gonna do it tonight because
I want to spend some time with my son so
maybe tomorrow I'll do that okay so
sometime tomorrow I don't know when

exactly when because I've kids and I
hate to commit to something that I can't
I can't hold on to so yeah so we'll do
that before I leave at some point won't
