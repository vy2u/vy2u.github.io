really like Facebook live okay let me
stop Facebook though YouTube live
because a lot of times when I don't film
something it's because I'm just not
ready to film look at me right now I got
no makeup on I got my hair in a ponytail
and I just don't care because we're
going live girlfriend or boyfriend we're
going live so I have a couple of things
to show you so I haven't even opened
these boxes yet but I have hello
everybody I have the I heart I love the
high heart I love brunch palette inside
this box along with one of the plushies
and I also have that I got from Birchbox
my Birchbox points were about to expire
and I needed to spend them so I'm gonna
do this second because I put in the yeah
I'm glad you're here Jenny um I put this
in the title so I want to do this first
because I am NOT clickbait tea
that's just not even mm-hmm I don't do
that so we're gonna go ahead and start
with this in case this is what you're
here for and if you want to stay for the
birch bucks you can okay so I live on
the east coast of the United States I
saw someone asked where I was been
interesting them yeah I love in Ireland
that's exciting
okay so I'm going to open this up and we
are going to rip it open because I'm so
excited yeah I'm Anna's first live chat
so glad to have you here which is about
it I love brunch larog cos that's what
we're gonna ask because you know what I
haven't even touched it yet so I have no
idea
but I have a pastel I have the pastel
goth right here so we can do a
comparison of the two right next to each
other I kind of feel like I missed the
window on reviewing the pastel kebab mmm
lisa says hi Jen finally may be able to
make chat yeah
a hello in Texas more love from Ireland
yos okay so here we go this is the look
at that look at the holographic Ness
right there yes this is exciting love
getting also box in the mail me - hi
Janelle I'm Michele glad you're doing
this for us yeah me too it's fun and you
know I just I'm not gonna be wearing
makeup in some of these and that's just
the way that it is okay so this is the
way that it looks it's got the beautiful
holographic I love that the little
holographic and then inside we also get
a little eyeprimer and honestly I'm not
a big fan of their eye primer I don't
really like it but I will use it with
this because more in love from Ireland
oh my gosh that's amazing
so never too late to review but I think
it's hard to get now so I don't want to
spend so much time on that when I can
spend time on something people can
actually get you know what do you mean I
would use my real name but it's weird my
real last name is weird so I feel yeah
I'll feel you on that one
all right anyway so that's that so I
don't know I just feel like if you can't
get it then what's the point of me
spending you know twelve hours editing a
video over something you can't even get
you know what I mean Jen do you if you
try the lorac California Dreaming
palette no but my friend Meredith
actually just bought it so she offered
to lend it to me so that I can compare
it to this one so let's go ahead and
open it up mmm so Patti so let's open up
the pastel goth and put next to it and
so you can see how the shades compare so
right away what I notice is that the
pastel goth is very very very bright
it's very bright and this one is more
true pastels where this is more like
neon lighter shades you know what I mean
like this is more real pastels
Florie says she just got the California
Dreaming nice it is the brunch when
everybody's talking about Celeste this
is that oh and let me show you this this
is the blush I got I didn't buy both
because you know girlfriend can't buy
everything because it's expensive KVD is
a lot brighter it sure is okay so this
is in
looma so let's talk about the blush
first since that is there you go now you
can see it since that is oh it's very
soft and see the powder kicking up when
we put you over here so you can see the
powder kicking up a little bit I'm gonna
do a hand swatch but I'm gonna actually
put it on my cheeks so we can see if we
can see it I have no foundation on those
so of course this is gonna look a little
different over foundation it looks like
is there shot as my hand just shiny or
is that the blush that might be the
blush with a little shine in it no
sparkle just shine or if I'm also gonna
check forever oh man price point on the
lorac of the palette it says on here $44
$44 and I forget the blush is my aura
see here the blush oh it doesn't say on
here the price is on it but I want to
say I was like like 20 bucks or
something I don't know so let's put
someone I'm just gonna grab a brush here
this is a real dense brush you know what
this is a very very light blush and this
is a very dense brush I'm doing this on
purpose because I want to be able to see
because it's so dense whether it shows
up or not no foundation no primer
nothing hmm very natural oh these in the
house sorry I don't mean to be so e okay
let's put on this side it's very light I
don't know if it work on medium to deep
because you know I'm gonna do I'm gonna
bring this to the bus stop and I'm gonna
swatch it on my friend Abbi I'm gonna
drive her arm be like Debbie give me
your arm swatch your daughter and I'll
put it in the description below let me
look at a mirror alright let's look in
the mirror uh we could definitely see it
it's definitely got some shine to it but
it's not sparkly like I mentioned it's
not sparkly we moved back a little bit
but you can definitely see it it's not
buildable though it's not buildable so
you're not going to be able to look if
you're very fair fair skinned or if
you're my skin tone you're not going to
be able to build it
like a brighter instagrammy kind of
blush it's very natural it's very soft
it definitely has a sheen to it
Thank You Adrian for that word Sheen
very true
what camera am i using I'm using my
daughter's iPad camera because yo can
you only do Facebook a lot at Facebook
on Facebook live you can lend you
YouTube live from from an iPad or a
phone so I'm using my daughter's iPad
because it's the most functional iPad
this mirror is by simplehuman and it is
like a total GameChanger
I love it I absolutely love yelling I
don't like as it does turn off sometimes
it's stupid expensive but for me for
doing makeup reviews and Instagram posts
and things like that I feel like I kind
of need something like that
when nice surprise the shirt color
training oh thank you I just threw it on
this morning just threw it on all right
let's get into the palette I'm so
excited we're seven minutes in already
and I haven't even swatch the palette
okay so this is very East story it makes
me think of Easter so let's swatch feels
the oh that looks powdery doesn't look
very good
let me put put a little more love into
that and see if I can get more more baby
more okay hold on if got to pull my
sleeve up yeah YouTube mom's yep you
know it all right so I'm gonna do a full
review of this so they'll be better
swatches when I do the full review this
is just first impressions very White's
sparkly gray ooh that one's pretty come
on try to hold it up here but very light
I'm curious to see how that's gonna pack
on the lid baby we'll pack it on in a
second that one's really pretty I really
like that
okay next row next row let's do it so
that was lavender eggs benny gluten-free
and hot sauce now we're gonna do jelly
donut pan yes things are mmm pancakes
sorbet and valet and I think gluten-free
is my favorite so far
eggs Benny's kind of neat too it's
different okay now this is definitely
going to be a supplemental kind of
palette kind of like the the Too Faced
white chocolate chip one where it's all
light shades you're gonna have to dip
into other shadows for this
wait they do give good color payoff
I'm not incredibly impressed with the
color payoff right now
not at all this is on someone just asked
what this is this is the new lorac the
brunch one I love brunch
do you think the colors in the pastel
goth are similar wanting if I need both
no they're not similar I'll swatch the
pastel golf in a second all right let's
go to the next one I need an I need to
put on my other arm we're gonna go and
we're gonna go to arm number two yeah
they're very light but sometimes it'll
look better on the eyes I'm not I'm not
giving up on it yet so this is Bloody
Mary blueberry scone moonlight and
avocado toast
I like this moonlight shade all right
let's go over here I can't not use the
swatching on this arm
I usually just wipe it off ooh that
one's pretty see that's good color
payoff these are good these are much
better look at the difference between
the color payoff there and the color
payoff over here I mean it's like not
even burnt okay that one definitely
looks better okay hopefully it goes on
the eyes all right let's do mimosa
mimosa this is so awkward with my left
hand smoothie french toast and Sunday
Funday
I love these names they're so cute okay
see this color payoff is much better I
wish the first two rows were this
pigmented of course they're getting the
same kick up that you usually get off of
a lorac shadow lots of powder happening
but the payoff is much better and again
better swatches are going to be in the
full review this is just the first
impression okay so now let me compare
that to the pastel golf I'm going to
swatch the pastel golf on this arm right
here I'm going to put them right here so
you can see the difference so that's the
mini star Clementine meow and dope make
sure I got good swatches okay
okay so this is the Kat Von D pastel
goth so we can see the comparison man I
wish I'd swatch those differently
because i swatched them to go like that
this is not working very well we're
gonna have to do this a little bit
differently in a second you can tell I
did not plan to do this like it but
we'll fix it we'll do it we'll get it
all together here we go
BAM go at this bream bream bream mareep
always the sound effects okay so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take the
brunch palette and I'm gonna swatch
similar colors on this arm and then that
way we can go like this you know what I
mean I think that'll be good okay new
plan new plan okay so we're gonna do
what the yellowy is shade first I'm
dropping things okay I'm gonna try to
match them up so the yellow is shade is
moonlight so we'll do moonlight we'll do
clÃ©mence Oh hot sauce looks there's no
similar lavender so that it matches and
then we'll do blueberry scone okay here
we go
swatch party swatch party sorry I'm a
little more awkward with this hands okay
so it might just be my awkwardness to
let me see if I can get in I'm better
okay let's get the purple a little
better not impressed with the lorac
pigment looks like but yet wait now I'm
pressed with the lorac pigment but KVD
looks great yeah the KVD looks great on
the lid too okay make sure I got really
good swatches of this lorac and remember
brush swatches are gonna look different
too and then let's go into moonlight the
yellow make sure I'm good there okay
okay we do still better yep I mean
oh did I not do a purple oh I skipped
100 there's two Purple's in here
ergh okay all right I'm a little bit off
here we're gonna do smoothie which is
like a purpley pink and then we're gonna
do Alva kado toast which is the green
then we're gonna do valet which is the
grey and gluten-free which is the
shimmery white I'm trying to match them
up they're gonna be a little off
sorry I missed up the order a little bit
and there's the shimmery white so the
orders a little off I should have put
that purple I switch the purple in them
yeah so yeah all right so let's do a
little bit more playing we're gonna put
a little on the eyes all right because I
don't want you to have to wait a week
for this review I want you to be able to
see it now in case you want to buy it
now so we're gonna put let's do we're
just gonna go crazy okay we're gonna put
avocado toast wait which one do we
already do we have questions about here
hmm what do you guys think maybe we'll
go with a primer and work well while I
put on the lorac primer on my eyes I'm
gonna test it out man let's see how it
goes I'm gonna show up at the bus stop
and parents gonna be like what did you
do to your face
and I'm gonna be like I was just playing
hanging out with my girls and my guys
all right okay lorac primer on my eyes
yes well that's what we're gonna find
out if it is buildable so let's go ahead
of me of course I can't put all of them
on my eyes at the same time I want to
see what moonlight looks like on the
eyes and of course there's lots of
different choices for brushes I always
get critiques about what brush I use
this is the one I like so we're gonna go
like this
and put that all over the lid
hmm oh I'm trying Cheryl okay let's do
something different on the other eye I
just want to check the pastel goth I
can't remember off the top of my head
how much the pastel goth was but I can
tell you it looks just like this on the
lid like these shades look just like
that where that's it's going past Ellie
you know
Oh Laurie have fun editing go check out
flurry sparks his YouTube channel by the
way you must do it okay we're gonna put
a little bit of let's do blueberries go
and up in the crease I don't know what
I'm doing I'm just going and I don't
care if it looks weird and that is not
showing up on my eye oh because I got a
fluffy brush so maybe if I pack it on it
look better but I can't see it
nope oh being the Queen nothing
happening of course I didn't put a
transition color on I'm just playing
right now
so no critiques on my makeup application
cuz I'm just playing all right let's do
I'm gonna look crazy by the time we
finish this video let's do a little bit
of I want to see what let's do a
blueberry scone on the other side luck
see brushes are very very good brushes
alright I want to try and see what this
looks like packed on the lid see it's
pretty bright that's blueberry scone so
that was blueberry scone in the crease
with a fluffy brush that's blueberry
scone packed on the lid okay let's do a
little bit of hot sauce in the crease
and see what happens
Julie says you're playing above my skill
level I love YouTube car okay
hello Marwin the rap out reminds me of
this Sigma eyeshadow palette that was
inspired by macarons yeah I don't know
you know Cheyenne I don't know I am
going to bring this to the bus stop with
me and I'm gonna grab my friend Debbie's
arm and I'm gonna be like daddy let me
see your arm and I'm gonna swatch a
mourner so I don't know yet they're very
light though I have I have reservations
I do not know
hmm I look crazy I look for Ike right
right now
all right let me see if I can like wipe
it off and start over cuz that's a sign
of pigmentation - can I wipe it off as I
increase my wrinkles on my eyelids by
ten times you're hanging me okay okay so
this sides gone the blueberries still
there let's pack a different color I
probably won't even do the birch box on
here I'll do the birch box thing real
quick
in a minute okay let's do I want to see
what avocados toast looks like ooh I
like that one that reminds me of mint
Edition a lot I wonder if that's the
same as mint Edition let me get out mint
Edition I have that all right this is La
Rock's mint Edition this is mint edition
and this is avocado toast they're a
little bit different
mint Edition is a little bit greener but
they're very very very close and I love
the shade the rest of the palette was
kind of blue but I really love the mint
shade in there so very very similar so
you have mint Edition hey Sheila okay
let's do a little bit of I want to see
what french toast looks like all over
the lid it's kind of shimmer on what
people are talking about people talk
about some weird stuff
all right let's try this one I already
had the blueberry on here but I want to
say and my primers probably all messed
up I'm just playing hey Rosie the
shimmer is kind of weak it's kind of
weak but I want to put french toast all
over top of the mint Edition and maybe
it'll brighten it up a little bit little
bit let's put a little gluten-free over
top like that so what you can do that I
just learned is if you put down one of
these matte pastel shades and then you
can put gluten-free over top and it'll
make it a shimmery shade that's cool I
think I found my favorite shade in here
it's gluten free that's a good one okay
so how do you guys feel about this is
there anything else you want me to show
you about this before I end the lorac
part it's up to you guys what do you
think are you a star are you talking
about that there's the sense there's a
man in black next to my drawers applying
it wet we can do that we can do that
let's get where's my six plus six goes
up in the house what'd I do with it cuz
I just used it so I'm trying to figure
out what I did with it you know what
I'll do I'm gonna just drop this under
the sink real quick I'll be right back
hold up all right we're just gonna use
water because I'm not sure where I put
my ladies water cuz I'm not sure where I
put my fix+ so the palette was $44 okay
and let's put it in one of these shades
that's a little bit lavender let's put
it in lavender and see what happens
mmm it looks wet it's scaring me that
I'm ruining my shadow right now mmm all
right let's put it right here
ah definitely getting a little more
solid pigmentation there do I think I'll
return it I have no idea I need
definitely need to play with it for a
full week okay
yay Galya that's awesome
see I don't know if it's bad I'm not
giving up on it yet I'm not giving up on
it yet I don't think it's bad
pigmentation yet I don't think so I'm
not there yet because I don't know if I
can mix these with other things and I
really like gluten-free a lot the red
shades
let's do Bloody Mary wets I'm gonna flip
my brush over and hopefully I'm not
ruining it I'm doing more shows all
right
okay there's Bloody Mary wet they're
very very light and the thing is too is
like if you watch my friend Tina Tina
Marie if you watch her white chocolate
Shepler I was thinking about deep skin
tones if you watch her white chocolate
chip video you can see how those light
shades went on her and they did show up
they just made her look like a disco
ball they were just crazy-looking so
right now first impression opinion about
this is I feel like this is definitely
gonna be a supplemental palette to other
shadows I did try it with a primer that
was the first shadows that I did was def
was with the lorac primer so I feel like
you're definitely gonna have to pull
from other shadows in order to get a
complete look you're gonna have to
you're gonna have to find some deep
shade you're gonna have to find
transition shades I mean you might be
able to use this as a transition shade
some people maybe if you're really
really light maybe this one hi Carmen um
but but I see there might be a place in
for this maybe um in someone with a
really big collection that already knows
how to use shadows or something even
just really likes easter-egg II looks I
don't know
Alexandra says I don't always think that
low pigment means the shadows are
automatically bad sometimes I just want
a light wash of color there you go I
don't know if this is only for sale oh
it might be for sale on the lorac
website as well I think it is don't
quote me on that but I think it's
available on the lorac website as well
so that's kind of how I feel about the
palette from first impression oh my gosh
we're 23 minutes holy moly how did that
then and then the pastel goth if you can
get your hands on this and you like
these shades it's insanely pigmented
very easy to use very fun very very fun
hold up my arms real quick so you can
see the squatches yes okay so this is
the pastel golf and then this is the
shades that I thought were similar in
the Isle of Sweden and somebody said
Sweden loves you and this Sweden these
are the shades that I thought were
similar in the lorac so this is lorac
this is Kat Von D so there you go I'm
gonna go ahead and open this really
really quickly and just show you what I
got but I'm not gonna review any of this
I just want to show you because I had
Birchbox points and I said I was gonna
do this so I got this for my daughter
this is the beauty protector protect and
detangle this stuff smells amazing and
it came with a detangling brush so I got
that for my daughter I also got the
Sunday Riley effortless breathable
tinted primer which I thought would be
really really fun to try it looks like a
tease I have nowhere to put it most
watched up so it's tinted like that it's
definitely tinted it might be even
deeper than my skin tone maybe not I
gotta put it on my face to find out and
then I'm curious about that though
does it smell smells a little skin skin
moisturizer a little moisturiz smelling
and I got the RMS Beauty unpowered the
Rach stuff is made in the USA let me
look at the box it usually says on the
box oh my gosh okay lorac says assemble
in the US and non non-us materials what
does that mean I'm gonna read it to you
assembled in the u.s. of us and non-us
materials okay so some of the things in
this palette were made in the United
States and some were not made in the
United States but it does not say where
they were made it just says non-us I
don't know seeing if it says anywhere
else on here
talc in here for people that don't like
talc there is talc and mica and a sec so
palmitate hmm I don't see any carmine at
least in the shade that I'm looking
shades that I'm looking at but I'll do a
complete thing on that later so there
are some non-us ingredients but with
almonds almonds so I got the RMS powder
I've heard really good things about this
so I wanted to try it or MSU tea powder
and is that all I got with my points
nope I got baby beauty blenders little
baby ones I did have a ton of points I
did because I used to make Birchbox
videos and I used to get a lot of
signups because of my Birchbox unboxings
so I had a lot left over from what I
used to do that so I had like a hundred
dollars in points yeah and I went over
by a little bit I think so yeah so
that's what I got so I'm gonna go ahead
and end it here because this video is 26
minutes long and that's really really
long so Cal wait Kim says California
Dreaming says the same thing with
materials made in PRC or People's
Republic of China gotcha yeah weird
where did you get that hair detangler I
tried a long time ago in the description
box so I'm not sure it's um I think it's
only available on on the Birchbox shop
I'm pretty sure so hugs Chen hugs in
your new house yep it smells really
really good
