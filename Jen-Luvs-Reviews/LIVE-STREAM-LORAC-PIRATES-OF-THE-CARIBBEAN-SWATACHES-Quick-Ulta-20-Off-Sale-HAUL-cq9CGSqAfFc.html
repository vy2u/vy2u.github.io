replay I don't want to spend too much
time off topic so let me show you what I
got
these things that actually already tried
all of these things so far so I can give
you a little preview hi Natalie I see I
feel so bad like not saying hi to people
you feel bad hi okay so anyway I got the
man-eater eyeliner by Tarte and I'll
give you a quick first impression of
this so the tip is very very bendy but
as you can see it's like ink it's like
straight black ink and it is gorgeous
and I love it it doesn't smear it
doesn't smudge a word all day yesterday
and it looks gorgeous from beginning to
end if you go like this oh thank you
Norma I love you back if you go like
this it doesn't rub off which is awesome
I mean right now it's probably gonna
smudge oh my gosh it's not smudging
right now look that's how long this been
on my hand hi in Mississippi dawn um but
yeah look at that like no nothing I'm
pushing as hard as I can and I can get
it to smudge but she would never do that
on the eyes so anyway amazing now I've
got this ugly black mark on me oh
whatever
so like you know it looks gross okay so
anyway I also got the steel kitten karma
this is one of their new the what you
call is the glitter bomb e fangs
hi Shawna I got my Fitbit on I'm gonna
leave that on because you know I've dip
it my mother wanted in the contest can
you believe it and she
it's me wasn't it nice of her so yeah so
I wore this yesterday and I will tell
you I had no fallout none none none none
I don't know if you can see the glitter
in it but there's chunky chunky glitter
in this and I had no fallout I could not
believe it
the other thing that hi Hannah
hi Jenn the other thing I tried
yesterday was this this is the ultimate
Alex six piece eye shadow I'm so excited
about this
I can't even hi Jessica Indiana hi Chris
from North Carolina oh my gosh wait till
you see this I think it was someone
looked it up for me yesterday I think it
was like 16 dollars $14 $12 I know was
ever ten dollars but not really gonna
sleep Spence maybe twelve dollars I
can't remember and it's not on the
receipt so I can't look so anyway let me
swatch these for you they feel buttery
soft and again this is Ulta brands and
let me swatch these real quick watch
this
oh um
gee look at that you see that ah let's
think amazing here it's going to the two
Purple's Bam Bam I got a little bit of
the brown in that purple a little bit I
still mixed it a little bit let me get a
better swatch of the one purple cuz I
messed up because they still had a
little brown on my finger that's without
the brown mixed in
so anyway Oh amazing I did the white
test on it and everything where's my
white test I just I just did the just
swatches for the lorac so I have mine
well I got step over the charger and get
my thing here let me show you watch this
watch this watch this watch this how
excited am I about this what test is
pretty stinking good on that and the
purpose of that is like if you over
blend the reason why I do the wipe test
is if you over blend your shadows then
you know they will fade away but these
kind of stay and also it kind of gives
you a hint to where time I'm telling you
this stuff lasted all day long all day
I'm so excited about this because I'm
always excited to find less expensive
products that perform like more
of products everyone has oh yeah for the
the Ulta thing the sale we all got
emails while we should you should have
got an email about it from Ulta if
you're a platinum and then you it has an
individual code for each person so they
had Ulta buy two get one free so this
was my free thing I got the uLTA Beauty
rainbow highlighter now these are the
ones that came today so these are all
unopened oh no I 5% battery and it's
plugged in oh maybe it's not a came
unplugged okay I think's dead I hope it
doesn't cut off on me I better hurry up
Shannon thank you for sending a sale for
Chad that's so nice I want even thinking
about super cheque I have super chat
products in here Swain Evo a rainbow
highlighter I'm just gonna swipe it down
the side cuz I don't want to ruin it but
put it like right there no pity
yeah nice that's the stealer okay as I'm
excited to play with that that's my
first rainbow highlighter I don't own
any of those they also send snail mail
code to everyone as well did they I did
not get one of those iPhone can't do
super Channel man and that's okay that's
alright and and i've been i people have
been asking me why i'm doing super chat
and i have it enabled but i'm not asking
anybody to do it and it's so people
people assume that all the money I make
off YouTube goes toward makeup like I
got like bills and stuff and two kids
so my YouTube money does not go to
makeup for the most part when I usually
buy products with is the sponsored video
money that I make usually go towards
product with the money I make from
Adsense usually goes toward like bills
so you know I got bills to pay this is
the foundation adjusting drops that I
got from Ulta brand this was my third
product so but I would never ask anybody
to do super chat and donate to the
channel but I'm gonna leave the option
open they give you a little mixing tray
which is amazing you must have a super
phone for super charity this is cool I
didn't know it came with a little tray
look it's got a little finger hole in
there and then you get your two shades
here so I'm gonna be playing with this I
needed a little bit of a darkening one
because I thought that um
spray-tan e stuff and i nots you will
you work you've always been super chat
Allison always since the beginning you
have been super in the chance because
she's down with them okay so anyway this
is the super chat stuff that I got I got
the lorac pirates cheek palette oh let's
open and swatch it
I hate bills - I know I know well and
the thing is - was I went from having a
full time job with excellent insurance -
no full-time job and horrible insurance
and insurance is stupid expensive and
insurance just went up like $300 a month
for this horrible insurance that I have
some hoping our government can fix it
soon cuz I don't want to pay for that
anymore it's insane alright
or at least make my benefits better I'll
pay for it but just make my benefits
better so anyway so this is the it's I
don't know I'm not gonna try to read
that up there ooh there we go okay let
us watch so its fortune lost soul they

treasure chest

comes with an eyeliner I didn't realize
that it says front of the line Pro black

selling point lorac that was smart lorac
that was very smart okay let us watch
lemon actually let me get this off my
arm
so that we can do better swatch I just
step over the charger again I really
hope this doesn't cut off on me okay my
leg back over oh sorry I'm missing all
of these beautiful comments the 20% off
I got because I'm a platinum on Ulta and
I got an email from Ulta it wasn't
because of youtube or anything it's just
because I'm um I have a platinum status
at Alta I just pour Bioderma on my arm
and I just go like this you're here
trying to declutter that's what we're
doing tomorrow Carla we're decluttering
okay get all nice and clean here okay
you would think they would help you out
with that since you're getting your life
back on track say strong lip oh I don't
know who you're talking to but I hope
everything gets better I'm going to call
them platinum money yeah yeah I don't
know what's happening with that all
right let us swatch will swatch real
quick cuz I'm scared my battery's gonna
die okay oh my gosh look at that blue
hmm that blue though I probably should
have taken pictures of this for
Instagram before i swatched it but oh
well whoo that didn't swatch very well
this one that was called bones this one
called Silver Mist that one's really
pretty I love this blue it reminds me of
the blue from the lorac pro 2 but
brighter okay so let's do where did
where did I stop I lost where I was one
two three four five six seven eight nine
ten did he get tell no tales I totally
don't even know where I stopped oh well
we'll start here mm-hmm oh I'm doing
force
I know where I stopped okay oh my gosh
oh my gosh can you see that sparkle hmm
holy moly I think they are all exclusive
shades I think that's what I heard that
they are okay we're gonna have to switch
sides here for the last row matey Lost
sea pirates chest and sea hey so right
now bones is the only one that didn't
show up on me oh I love that sea haze
it's like green with a yellow shift so
pretty hi Mandy Mac HSN has it too
that's always nice cuz they have like
the flex pay and everything there we go
there's the last two that's Menace and
silent Mary so first impressions my
favorite shades oh look at that right
there that's some skill oh hi teri Lee
bonus chat bonus chat my favorite shade
so far I love this glittery black I love
all these this one is boned that one's
yucky this one right here Silver Mist
ooh all of them they're all gorgeous oh
my god so really excited to play with
this more not excited I got it on my
sweater but you know let's do white
test.c one thing to look for in the
white test when I do this is whether
they stay true to color or it just turns
like brown so you see how this didn't
turn brown it's still red and how this
blue didn't gray out it's still you can
still see blue so that's good man good
stuff good stuff alright blue is
gorgeous oh my gosh shave tape is
amazing I love my shake tape - okay so
the other thing I got with super chat
money is I got one of the lippies they
were really expensive I wasn't getting
more than one I try to be responsible
with the money and not go overboard you
know what I mean so alright so here's
the lippy that I got this one is why you
say lippy I hate that
Libbie why don't we say that it's got a
little peel-off thing for the mirror so
there's a little mirror in here and then
this one is called Sparrow lip gloss and
lipstick so let's see what we got so the
lipstick comes out like that let's put
it on even though I'm not wearing any
makeup we'll put on anyway oh it's very
nude I wouldn't expect me to be so nude
you know kind of reminds me of the
graveyard girl shade it's very grey
wasn't expecting that I didn't see lip
swatches of this one don't forget five
times points on Urban Decay plus their
blushes and powders for 40% off thank
you so much for that let's do the
iridescent topper thingy yeah I'm not
sure about this color no no that might
be nice I don't see the iridescent in it
at all I can see it here but I don't see
it on my lips at all I don't know I
guess it's kind of pretty I don't know I
did get the blush poets it's so pretty
oh my goodness so pretty yeah I don't
know if I'm gonna keep that I'll review
it and I don't know I'm gonna keep it
we'll see I don't know it's okay
I'm not wearing makeup which makes
things look really weird too
I haven't seen the Mac on there yet you
don't like to let either Emily yes young
I'm like on the fence about it I think
if I was wearing other makeup it may
look better right now I feel like I look
a little dead it looks a little like all
right this is the other steel on
magnificent metals one that I got this
one's called ballet baby the other one I
got did I say it was um the kitten one
you like it Jerry I think I like it I
don't know I haven't decided yet
Judeans places on sale mmm
I love me some devious place all right
this is the ballet baby stealer oh my
gosh hmm can you see that pink you don't
think I look dead Mary I think I do
what brand was the rainbow highlighter
that was old top Ulta brand
I love devious place they're definitely
one of my favorite brands so that one I
got these two I got this this one the
pink one and then I got
this one is kitten is that it's about it
I think that's it so that's it I'm kind
of getting used to this color I don't
know we'll have to try it on with other
makeup and stuff too
so that is it for my haul so if you were
just joining us just very quickly let's
recap what I got so I got the lorac
Pirates of the Caribbean I got one of
the lippies and then I got the eyeshadow
palette that looks like this
Thank You Catherine she said my my my
skin looks nice today thank you Emily
loves ballet baby nice Angela said I
would never wear makeup but my skin look
like your she's oh thank you
there's the lorac palette it comes with
an eyeliner and then there's a hidden
door inside they're so smart they're so
smart and then the blush palette I
bought this separately though the blush
palette doesn't come with it they should
have done that where they had the option
to do both and you save like 5 bucks or
something the blush palette swatched
beautifully lorac is doing really well I
wish that they marketed their stuff a
little bit more like I feel like they
should send it to influencers and stuff
like that they don't really do that I
got this from Ulta this is the
lightening and darkening tint II stuff
what's it called its called foundation
adjusting drops I wanted to try that I
got but there was bye-bye to get one
free so I got the free rainbow
highlighter and then this hmm this is
the alter Beauty metallic six piece
eyeshadow palette if you're looking for
some really good metallic eye shadows
but you don't want to buy a makeup geek
you don't want to buy color rain you
don't want to buy Julia's place I'm
telling you and these clothes are
calling to you you should totally do
that you should totally do that
Skyler we're just doing that Skyler sis
just got here what's going on uh we're
just doing a little Holly thingy and it
just ended we're done so the lip color
does nothing for ya well you already
told me that I don't with you I hear you
I'll fill you i'll fill you should oh
and then I got the man-eater eyeliner
from Tarte that I forgot to mention I'll
take it off I feel like it's bothering
hi so yeah so the livestream cut off and
we've got a lot of backlight we can't
turn have it this way okay and that's
okay
I just well they'll be here in a second
but I just wanted to say goodbye because
I felt really bad that it ended off like
that my battery died or Lila's battery
died so we're gonna go ahead and end the
livestream now but I do apologize that
it ended so fast and I just realized I
had to like officially end it so we're
ending it now well I think I wanna say
