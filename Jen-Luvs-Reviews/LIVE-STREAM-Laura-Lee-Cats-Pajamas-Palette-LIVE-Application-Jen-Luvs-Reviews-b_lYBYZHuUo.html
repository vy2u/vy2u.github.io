goodness it is so nice to be back live
with you I love being live with you
because I get to talk directly to you
and that makes me so happy today
we are going to be trying out the Laura
Lee Los Angeles cat's pajamas eyes
shadow palette Laura was kind enough to
send this to me Laura and I have been
come acquaintances on the edge of
friends over the past year or so we met
at generation Beauty in lausanne not
West yeah
Los Angeles I think we first met in New
York we did I think we first met in New
York and then I saw her again in Los
Angeles I think they all run together I
don't know but we've kept on in touch on
social media and I was she was nice
enough to tell me that she was gonna be
willing to send this to me now I did
make sure to let her know that I am
going to be doing an honest review of
this so make sure that's the same
disclaimer I give to all companies that
want to send me something it's like I'm
gonna be thorough and I'm gonna be give
you I'm gonna be giving honest reviews
so she was fully aware of that which to
me shows that she has full faith in this
product I did try it out yesterday live
on periscope
that was the first time I used it so if
you're curious about that you can go to
my Twitter which is Jen Lowe's reviews
and you should be able to find a link to
it there you can also see check-ins that
are still up I believe on snapchat if
you want to see the check-ins from that
look I think you should still be able to
find those there I'm Jen Lowe's reviews
over on snapchat as well okay so let's
go ahead and I just want to go ahead and
say hello to people that are here very
quickly today is a no makeup day
typically but I do want to try this as
much as possible for the full review on
Friday is when I'm hoping that the full
review will go live on planning on
filming it next Wednesday I want to make
sure I try it a lot of times before and
really get a feel for this palette so
this is not a review video it's just in
a live demo and so that you can kind of
start forming some opinions about what
you think based on my opinion there are
some other reviews my friend Laura from
mrs. Lowell ended one and I think there
are a couple other ones up at this point
along with Laura's and Jeffrey's I don't
think Manny did one yet but there's
other reviews as well someone asked hair
asked where's this shirt from this
is a Michael Franti shirt I love Michael
Franti if you don't know Michael Franti
and spearhead
happiest place on earth
happier than Disneyland I'm telling you
Michael Franti concerts are amazing but
hello to everybody actually let me screw
up and just say hi real quick and then
we're gonna go ahead and get started
Connie got here first hello Connie good
to see you tabatha knows purple voodoo
people hello hello Katy hello good to
see you she said Katie said Oh glad I
checked YouTube I noticed you mentioned
live chat on snap yesterday yes I did
maxime dicing that right Maxine finally
made it max oh I don't want to do that
wrong finally made it to one of these in
time I'm super interested in seeing a
review of this palette again this is not
a review I just want to make sure I'm
very very clear on that I'm still
forming my opinions on this palette good
morning - are we still mourning no we're
good afternoon good afternoon - Rachel
and - Lea Lea - LeAnn - cupcake and
Malorie and John and Elise and Cyr
that's told me her name millions of
times and I can't remember it apparently
Michelle been loving your comments
lately and Lizzy and Kristy thank you so
much for being here I think I saw
Cassie's here - Cassie Britton thank you
so much for being here I am doing well
Tony how are you my old friend oh my
goodness I haven't seen tawny and
forever how you been girlfriend alright
let's go ahead and get started yesterday
I use the Too Faced shadow insurance
today we're gonna use the all type
rhymer I like to use lots of different
eye primers I like to use no eye primer
I like to just really make sure I'm
getting you know lots of information
about how something works so do a little
bit of all to eye primer and I'm not
doing a full face today we're just gonna
do the Laura Lee palette now you notice
that the discoloration is not muted out
on my lids I'm doing that on purpose
we're not gonna go to shape tape route
today I will do that eventually as a
test but not today this is the pouch oh
one thing before I get started leave my
glasses back on let me show you the
packaging this is something really
important I wanted to show you so
hopefully you can hear me better by the
way I bought a new microphone I lost
somehow I misplaced my microphone that I
had bought I used it for like two weeks
and then you know so hopefully you can
hear me about
okay so this is the little card that
comes with it it says cat's pajamas
drops Friday October 13th
lauralee Los Angeles so I don't know if
this is gonna come in yours but on here
and also inside the box there is a
grammar error it says cat's pajamas with
an apostrophe s I did let Lauren know I
don't think there's anything she can do
at this point with it but it's also here
I know some people were really annoyed
with that apostrophe just remember it's
just a mark it is a mistake but you know
everybody makes mistakes and we're all
here to always be better right so in
case you have trouble with that like a
lot of people do do what I used to teach
my students is it's like a little hands
and it's possessive I own you you're
mine so it's the cat's pajamas that
pajamas belong to the cat so it's an
apostrophe because the cat owns the
pajamas but the pajamas don't own
anything so therefore there's no
apostrophe that's the way I used to
teach it so we used to practice it a
group I go I go possessive and they go
possessive and then I own you I know you
you're mine you're mine and that's the
way I used to teach it so in case you
meet that tricks you up it tricks up a
lot of people that's the way I used to
teach it but anyway so there are those
in there Laura Lee Los Angeles calm is
gonna be only place that you can get
this at this point the outer packaging
looks like this and then the palette has
the sparkles on the outside we're gonna
go a little bit more into all of that
and full swatches and everything in the
full review this is how the palette
looks and I was surprised to see that
these were all similar really similar in
tone when I watched her video it seemed
like some might be lighter but they are
kind of all that medium to a darker
color here there's a little bit more
variation in tone here where we've got
kind of light light medium medium
edging on dark medium edging on dark and
then of course we've got the black here
so this really is a more deep kind of
palette a more smokey kind of palette
not a lot of light looks to be created
with this it's going to be a darker
palette at least so far
stephanie says I love the hand possesive
your mind's so cute I mean that was
after you know however many years of
teaching I figured that out but you know
you learn little tricks along the way
okay so let's go ahead and let's go and
start applying you get and I'm also
trying different kinds of
Rush's with this because I want to see
what kinds of brushes work best so if
you see a brush and I'm using it and you
don't feel like that's the right kind of
brush to use just know that I'm trying a
lot of different kinds of brushes so
bomb-diggity is the transition shade for
me in here it is the lightest one and
it's in here that I could use for a
transition some people might prefer
kray-kray I might use Craig Cray
sometimes for a transition and I'm just
gonna go ahead and let me see if I can
get a little closer so you can see and
we're going to apply oh I got some lash
glue leftover from yesterday
I just noticed right there oops that is
what it is this is just an impromptu
livestream you see if I can get it off
there we go
I don't want to pull my lashes out but
it definitely has some nice blending
ability you do have to be gentle when
you dig into the shadows
they're not like lorac powdery but they
do kick up some powder so just don't dig
super hard into them if you do decide to
get this because that's one thing I'm
noticing okay so now my transition is in
yesterday I use scatterbrain as like
part of it and then I use redonkulous of
like part of it like you know what it is
are you scatter brain and redonkulous
all over my lid I think I'm gonna go
from matte no because I want to show you
the shimmers hmmm let's go see this is
this is where I'm kind of like with the
shade selection I like a light look on
my lid and there isn't a lot of light
option so maybe we'll do scatterbrain
all over the lid and we'll just kind of
beef up the crease a bit so I'll take
Kuki which I don't think I used
yesterday I can't remember and we'll put
that kind of above the crease a bit to
kind of warm up the brow bone so you can
see there really isn't any patchiness
which is very nice people are
complaining about the price just so you
know with my calculations in my head
that I had done there'll be formal
calculations in the full review it's $2
per gram which is about 50 to 80 cents
less than two-faced which is one of the
less expensive products for fur Sephora
there are two grand pants
which are pretty decent-sized pans so I
personally feel like it's a good value
because it's $2 per gram which is which
is good urban decay hovers around the
$3.00 per gram mark and the new two-face
peach one was at $3 per gram so it's
definitely a fair price I feel like if
the shadows are the same quality as the
Sephora brand shadows alright let's go
ahead and do a little brow bone because
this this is driving me nuts this little
sharp line up here like clown line see
if I'm hopefully I'm close enough now
I'm noticing that the white is having a
little bit of trouble blending but it's
just you know a little bit of trouble
blending but it might just be the brush
I'm using like see how you can't really
see the white how it just kind of
disappears into the red like with the
nuke with the Kat Von D shadows the
white just kind of stays white where
this one blends in which isn't
necessarily a bad thing it's just what
you're looking for if you want that
white to stay white you probably want to
try to keep it away from the other
colors Kenny says but then again she was
making she was involved in the process
of making it so I think her focus was on
the making of it not as much on the
final product which is understandable I
don't know I don't know if she was more
focused on the making of it rather than
the final product I would imagine she
wouldn't want to release something
without it being really good I don't
know I'm gonna do a little bit in her
corner real quick and we'll be fed up if
we can but I feel like the white is a
very soft white it's not a super opaque
like like the like the Kat Von D ones
like if you got the pastel goth and the
white in there it's very the whites like
super opaque where this one's a little
softer it's not quite as opaque when you
put it on Shirley says nice to see you
again are the colors comparable to color
pops I think I love you I don't own that
I'm sorry but you know what we're gonna
do for the full review is we'll try to
compare these to some other shadows I
will try to do some dupes just kind of
depends on the amount of time I have cuz
that really does take a super long time
but I do want to at least show you some
dupes if not all the dupes in my
collection I don't think I'm gonna do
all of them like I did with the
Jacqueline hell because
I just took like a stupid amount of time
Oh Jodi's here hi Jodi she says I'm glad
you're reviewing this Jen I feel like
the other channels are either friends
with her are afraid to be actually
honest about its performance you know I
would consider myself friends with her
but she knows that I'm gonna be honest
no matter what and she knew that when
she sent it so I would hope that
everybody would be honest no matter what
but I can I can understand the
skepticism I understand it but I'm
hoping everybody would be honest about
it
I try to you know I don't know but you
know you know you're gonna get that from
me I can't speak for everybody else I
don't know everybody's heart but I can
definitely tell you I'm gonna be honest
about it
okay so scatterbrain now this shade
right here is kind of chunky I don't
know if you can see but when I rub my
finger in it do you see the powder
coming off of it so you just have to be
aware of that this reminds me a lot of
the formula of the colored rain Queen of
Hearts gold it's also very chunky like
this where pieces of it kind of fall off
it's a I don't I don't know what the
deal is but this is definitely a
different formula than the rest of the
shadows in the palette I'm gonna try
applying it with a brush all over my lid
and then if that doesn't work we'll do
with the UM whoo we'll do it with the
fingertip so we'll just put that all
over and we're definitely not getting
full opacity with the brush but we're
getting a nice light look so if you're
going for like a more light look we're
gonna do the brush let's do the
fingertip and see how much it beefs it
up and you can see whoa chunkies falling
off chunkies falling off and again with
practice I might get better at that so
if you want that full shiny pop
fingertip if you want something lighter
brush it seems but again this only
second time I've used it I I need a
little more time before I give you full
I don't know that's pretty pretty crazy
look and let's just since I did the
other side let's punch it with the
fingertip lasting power with the
two-faced crime yesterday was fantastic
I still had just a litte they were
pretty muddy by the 11 hour mark but I
definitely still had a little bit of
separation of color by 11 hours 9 hours
it still looked pretty good but 11 hours
it was really starting to money together
which is not abnormal
Tamm says also people say $40 USD is
priced high I live in candidates to me
$40 USD is super reasonable because for
me $40 USD converted to Canadian taxes
duty shipping comes up to about 70 to 80
dollars that seems like a lot that seem
that seems very expensive 70 to 80
dollars but I don't know because I'm not
Canadian like I don't know how that
feels
you know in every country your your your
money feels different you know as far as
the number on it like when I went to
Iceland then it was you know it was a
dollar to every hundred Crona you know
so when they say something's 100 kroner
that's nothing but I mean because that's
like a dollar does so I don't know how
that feels as far as being in Canadian
since I'm not Canadian glams glam enough
says that shimmery shade definitely
looks gorge looks gorge on I do have
some fallout but that might be due to my
application method but I'm gonna play
with it more and I'll let you know if
there's if that's a problem I don't know
if it's a problem yet but there is
fallout could you touch in the
ingredients I'm highly sensitive to town
let's say we find the box mica based
let's tell you the ingredients so we
have mica try I don't know how to
pronounce this mine try fall hex no in
trifle hexlen Owen I don't know t RI e
th yl h e ex a and oh i n I have seen
that in other ingredient other eyeshadow
poets but I don't know how to pronounce
that one boron nitride silica thanks
teri FX will palmitate synthetic floor o
for flow gabite no matter how much I
learned these ingredients there's always
something that trips me up
FL you are pH L o GOP ite phenoxyethanol
capital and capital glycol at the HEC so
glycerine hexlen glycol tocopherol and
Kayleen Kailen Kailen
that one i know how to pronounce i'm
still messing it up titanium dioxide
iron oxides manganese violet ferric
ferrocyanide and tin oxide so the only
pigment in there that is not lips ape is
safe is the ferric ferrocyanide all the
rest of those are lips safe so yeah so
that's that so it is mica base there is
no talc sure there you go that's
exciting hi summer can you put the
ingredients in the description box of
the video yes I can I'd be happy to
summer and for some reason in ten
minutes after this video is not and has
rendered if for some reason that's not
there just put a little comment Jen
ingredients and I'll do it I'll try to
remember but I'm editing what's up and
makeup today so I'm a little bit hyper
focused on that right now
okay so one thing I noticed about
Jeffers stars look with it I didn't
watch the whole video kind of scan
throat was that he used on ball up in
the crease and I really wasn't a fan of
that black out in the crease so what I'm
gonna do is I'm just gonna kind of try
to swirl it in the outer corner I use it
on my lower lashline yesterday but I
feel like up in the crease it may not be
the best place for it so I'm just gonna
stamp it hmmm and see if I can keep it
in that outer V I almost wish she had
put a very deep brown instead of the
black because I feel like the black
really um I don't know if it fits with
the rest of the shades you know what I
mean I'm trying not to bring it too far
up in my crease but I really I mean this
it's a nice black it on first watch it's
it's a little bit gray but on second
swatch it's nice and it does have does
it have a little bit of glitter in it it
might have a tiny bit of glitter or it
might just be like the fallout from
other shadows in here pulled it up real
close see if you can see and we put back
a little just in case
yeah I don't really like what I just did
at all I'm not a fan of the black with
these shadows I think this will be a
good black to use with other palettes
but it's not oh I already put I forgot I
already put some on the other side I
like Laura but I just can't get excited
about these colors have so many palettes
that look like this and that's
completely understandable I totally get
that point of view
I'm just not not a fan of the black with
the rest of the shades but again this is
the second time I've used it so maybe
I'll be able to find a good use for it
see it doesn't look as bad on that side
when I just used a little tiny bit it
doesn't look as bad as glitter in the
black is there glitter in the black
color I think there might be a tiny tiny
tiny tiny bit but it's definitely a
matte i don't yeah I think there is a
tiny bit of gold glitter in it but it's
very fine and it's very tiny unless
somehow it just sprinkled on there I'll
have to ask Laura if there's actual
intentional glitter in there it looks
like there is for the full review I'll
have all of that Larissa says hi Jen I'm
always so happy when I manage to catch
you live you're so hard working on us
and I love any reviews so down-to-earth
and funny lots of love love love thank
you so much that's a nice of you all
right I'm gonna try to cover this up a
little bit with the in one ear shade try
to soften the black a little bit because
I feel like it's too harsh so I'm gonna
try to whoa okay not really happy about
well I don't know that's interesting
well no that's not so bad that's
actually kind of pretty this might make
a really good uhm I'm saying hollow I
it's not Hollow
when is it hot when you do halo not
hollow sorry I've been watching too much
simply neurological lately some gotten
on the hollow thing it's might that make
a really nice halo I to do this but I'm
not gonna do a halo today not feeling it
today when I definitely lightened up the
black it made it a little less
crazy-looking there we go how
blend that up a little bit just a little
I'm gonna bring a little bit of out the
other two kind of mix in with that a
little bit but they are blending really
nicely into each other I do want to show
you scatter brain and redonkulous next
to each other to show you
everybody's like halo ijen halo I I know
now thank you though I appreciate it if
I hadn't gotten it that would have been
really nice it's you guys always help me
I appreciate it
nobody's perfect all right I like that I
like that a lot
okay I feel like I'm missing a little
bit of gold in the inner corner so I'm
gonna take a little brush and kind of
pop it in the inner corner I definitely
see some fallout on my cheek so I'm
gonna have to be careful of that next
time I wasn't super careful today I'm
just gonna make sure I got that inner
corner oh you know why it's because of
the white that the gold kind of
disappeared but I want the gold all the
way to the center there okay there we go
all right so let's do a little lower
lash line and then after that we'll do
liner and mascara so that we can kind of
see how it would look kind of finished
so I'm going to use out the other just
on the lower lash line a bit and please
remember to I am NOT a makeup artist so
this is just me with my personal makeup
experience but I am not formally trained
in makeup obviously so you know just be
aware of that okay so we've got out the
other and I just realize I haven't used
quirky yet I want to make sure I use
that soon and let's do let's do a little
bit of redonkulous just so you can see
it on the lower lash line down here
though not a fan of what I just did it's
pretty but it's not it doesn't really go
with the rest of the look put the orange
on the bottom at least I don't think it
says oh no it's not so bad once I get
liner on it will probably look better
Jen on Laura did say there's glitter in
the black but it wouldn't show up once
it's blended out that's okay good there
we go
thank you so much for that I appreciate
it I missed that for some reason all
right let's do a little bit of liner
Shirley said the good part of this
palette from this and your snaps is the
colors don't mud into each other so
that's a huge plus for me actually
speaking of that Thank You Shirley for
reminding me I want to do a little
swatch of these because this is what I
did yesterday and I want to kind of show
you scatter brain and redonkulous and
next to each other I'm gonna swatch them
directly next to each other and then
kind of blend them into each other let
me do another swatch of scatterbrain
here okay so that's them next to each
other and then one of me kind of blend
them into each other so you can kind of
see what they look like on the eye
together
what doesn't it's not exactly the same
because of course your eye skin is
different than your hand skin but Megan
says she said she spent two years on
this I just don't know if I can believe
it it doesn't look like anything goes
together it just so scattered no color
theme you know what Melissa I'm Melissa
Megan I might have to disagree with you
on that you have a hundred percent right
to your opinion on that when I think of
scattered hold on a second let me show
you what I think of when I think of
scattered this right here baby
this to me looks super scattered where I
know Kat Von D's opinion like this was
supposed to look like stained glass I
give you full information on this but
it's supposed to look like stained glass
but as far as the color is being
scattered and no particular theme this
is kind of what I think of
that's an amazing artist she knows how
to put colors together and I'm really
struggling with this so far because I
just don't know how to put the colors
together I'm working on it though I'm
still testing this Lloris palette jumped
ahead of that one for review but with
this one I mean we're definitely going
with a warm theme these colors are very
very similar and it's actually a
critique of mine something that I'm not
a fan of of this palette that these are
so close together in shade
these are also very close together in
shades so in my mind there's only so
much so many looks you can get out of
this because the colors are so similar
because the theme is too strong for me
that's just my personal opinion but
again you have absolute right to feel
the way that you want to feel I
completely respect that but for me I
feel like that's kind of a theme of it
and as far as it taking two years and
not really you know like you know that
you're not sure it doesn't look like she
spent two years on it it's kind of hard
to know without being there so I don't
know I wasn't there so I can't really
speak to like how much effort she put
into it because I wasn't there during it
she didn't let me know what she was
doing I found out when everybody else
found out I didn't know you know no I
did find out everything when everybody
else found out about it but I can tell
you it does take a long time to develop
I showed us and she did say she had to
switch labs which I'm sure was very
expensive and very time-consuming to
start all over again with a new lab so
you know that's just my opinion again so
um let's see who is this say someone
aren't Anna so Anna hi Anna someone on
reddit rearranged the colors on the new
kat von d palette and makes more sense
off to send you the pic oh my gosh Anna
that would be amazing
thank you so much for that I really
appreciate it Angela wants a full st. &amp;amp;
Center review I will definitely work on
that I would love to I Tina says I
wanted a dark rich brown and said the
black I agree I feel like that would
have been a little bit a little bit more
usable in my opinion for what I am able
to do in the palette but I do like the
way the black mixed with that Burgundy
though so maybe there's a way to use it
I have so much fallout on my cheeks from
that gold
it's insane so I need to be more aware
next time and if I can't avoid the
fallout I will definitely be letting you
know this is the em cosmetics felt tip
liner it is fantastic I have to tell you
though I like the NYX one just as much
and the next one's a lot cheaper but if
you want to try something from and
cosmetics this is a wonderful liner I
don't think I'm going to do a wing today
because I'm just staying at my house and
editing and then we'll do I wouldn't
put on mascara and stuff if it wasn't if
I wasn't doing this with you guys
Oh No it stopped scrolling okay Oh
Jennifer says yes and I want to see that
too let me have to see if I can um if
you link the reddit thread for me then
maybe I can link it in the description
for everybody else so they could see it
cuz that's really very very smart cuz
somebody that understands that stuff
probably did it this is the L'Oreal
voluminous mascara not L'Oreal
voluminous that's not true this is the
Lord oh yeah this I thought it was
voluminous let's see mega says $40 seems
like a lot of colors that I have in
other palettes and that is something
that you're gonna have to decide because
I can completely see that that this is
something you have in other palettes and
you know what's funny I think I told you
guys a while back that I was thinking
about doing my own makeup line this was
way before I heard about Laura and I
have him notes in my phone for an
eyeshadow palette about what colors I
would want and it's so funny because
it's a warm palette and everybody would
have come back I mean we have all these
shades by the time it was able to be
produced it would probably have been so
out of trend I mean when you start
developing something you know she
started developing this too if she
started throw up in those two years ago
that was before the warm trend really
hit you know what did Paris say Paris
says deeper skin tones cannot use those
trick those as transition colors that is
a really good point and I think that
would have been but you know what you
could use you could use out the other
most likely maybe as a guess you might
be able to use out the other oh no
that's a little bit of shimmer nevermind
or kooky could you use kooky let me
swatch it with my finger could you use
that as a transition I don't know your
personal skin tone so it's hard for me
to recommend but I mean it's not a it's
a it's a burgundy it's not a skin tone I
don't think no I wouldn't say that's
probably a skin to them
for a brand just starting out from a
youtuber this polish too high even 5
bucks cheaper would have made a
difference and I've heard that argument
before and I think it was Stephanie
Nicole that addressed it with Natasha -
no no and what she had said was you have
to start at the price point that you
plan on keeping and as an example the
NYX palettes you know the NYX palettes
are $30 and people are freaking out
because it's NYX why would you you know
buy a NYX palette for $30 you know I
don't know why they're $30 on the
weather's so expensive but you know you
kind of have to start out at the price
point that you want them to be at and it
really does depend on the price of the
ingredients I mean and I think $2 per
gram is is really inexpensive it's not
as inexpensive as like jus vyas place is
cheaper the morphe palette by Jacqueline
Hill is less per gram but again that was
that was pretty not again because I
haven't said it yet but the morphe
palette that was by Jacqueline Hill was
bought by morphe like morphe paid for
all of that Jacqueline I'm assuming I
shouldn't say that they did but I'm
assuming the jacqueline didn't put any
money up front for the morphe palette
based on what I have what she said and
what I've heard that morphe paid for it
from the jump so you guys think about
this this is Laura investing her own
money to make this which i think is a
little bit different so price program
and also aren't morphe palettes isn't
there something morphe that's China
where Laura made it in the United States
I think that's that's part of it too but
I can't remember if Morpheus all China
in their labs I can't remember it's like
out of my head right now that's I just
got my boxycharm yesterday and what do
you think of the pure palettes so far
I'm not a fan I just got mascara on my
thumb hold on a second but I need to use
it more before I fully review the pure
palette I haven't used it enough to be
honest I've used it twice that's not
enough but so far it's not it's not
doing it for me but yeah so this is the
final look definitely not perfect the
eyes don't match perfectly it's a little
deeper on this side I like this side
better than this side
so that's the final look and I do like
the way it came out the fallouts insane
but that may be my fault but I feel like
the colors blended really nicely I
didn't have a lot of patchiness the gold
if you want it more poppy the shimmer
shades you want to definitely Pat it on
with the fingertip I haven't tried these
wet yet I'll have to let you know as far
as the wet again full review is coming
let me see anything else anybody wants
to know about this it's been 30 minutes
that's kind of long so I should probably
cut this off but I'll kind of wait a
second see if there's anything anybody
else wants to know about this palette
before I close it up yeah my right side
I definitely like better fisa phoebs is
not a fan of the palette design I'll
give you my thoughts on that in the full
review I do have some thoughts on why I
like it just for Laura if this was
anybody but Laura I would kind of be
like what the world but there are things
that I like about it because of what I
know of her Susan says palettes are like
underwear we all have our favorites that
change day and date changed by day and
outfit whatever
what's everyone anticipated what's
everyone's anticipated palette coming if
you want to have a continued
conversation about any of this you can
go ahead and join the Facebook group
which is what's up and makeup and if you
search for what sort of makeup you
should be able to find it or
facebook.com slash group slash what's up
in makeup it does usually take a few
days to get in because we had a lot of
requests every day but and you got to
make sure you answer the three questions
if you want to get in but yeah that's a
great place to discuss this stuff easily
gotten though with another palette
probably it just depends on what you
already own because these are not
uncommon shades there's nothing in here
to me that is super unique to this
palette as far as the colors but I don't
know what you personally own we all have
a different collection so you kind of
have to decide that for yourself but as
far as the quality of the shadows so far
I'm good the only thing that I'm like
kind of glued on right now is the
fallout from scatterbrain but that might
have been my fault so I'm not 100% on
that yet I'm gonna go ahead
and cut it off but I want to thank you
so much for being here we are having
chat full chat tomorrow at 5:00 p.m.
Eastern Time we're gonna do my
generation beauty haul so hopefully
