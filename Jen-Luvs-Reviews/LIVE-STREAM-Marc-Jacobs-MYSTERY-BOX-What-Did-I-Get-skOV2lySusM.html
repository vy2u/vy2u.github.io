looks right now the way it sounds if you
were not here for the earlier livestream
when I tried to do this earlier my I
updated my Mac and there's now two
software's that are not working with my
Mac and one of them is my live streaming
and coding software so I learned that
when I tried to go live earlier so
unfortunately we are going to have poor
sound and poor visual on this I'm on my
daughter's iPad because I really I can't
wait I can't wait to open this I can't I
can't I have to open it now like now I
can't wait till tomorrow I have to know
what's in here so just so you know what
this is this was a mystery box that that
they released oh they're good there's
more people coming so I was getting a
little nervous that this didn't work
okay it worked but this was a mystery
box that they released on Black Friday
that Marc Jacobs released it was $45 and
they guaranteed to get over $100 worth
of stuff inside so I'm super super
excited
oh yeah hello how are you full moon
magic good to see you okay
I'm not sure if this is getting some out
to subscribers I have a better thumbnail
that I'm gonna put up a sooner but I
just couldn't wait I have to know what's
in there so in here there's my receipt
oh yeah oh my friends are coming this is
how it looks on the inside but I just
couldn't wait I couldn't I could wait
till tomorrow I have to know right now
whether my forty five dollars was
well-spent okay so in here there is a
bag and in the back there are four items
so if you think it's $45 including
shipping was 50 bucks so like 12 bucks
per product and usually Marc Jacobs
stuff is like $30 or product I think
like between like you know 20 to 30
dollars a product so we'll see what I
got I'm gonna have to calculate this and
then I will put it down in the video
description how much the full value was
because at this point I'm not gonna know
so okay so Melissa cannot wait to see
the goodies awesome and opening Louisana
opening okay so this right here this
says Marc Jacobs enamoured high shine
lacquer so this is one of their nail
polishes
and I think I tried one of their nail
polishes it's a red one and I like it
it's a very nice formula it's taped see
if I I'm ripping it I'm ripping it I
can't wait I can't stop I have to know
what it is I have to rip it okay all
right all right I'm opening I'm opening
okay well okay so it's the silver shade
which is beautiful I'm currently testing
out the kathleenlights nail polish for
review they were kind enough to send me
the lips and the lips and tips set so
I'm working on a review of that so I've
got my kathleenlights a Lumiere on right
now but yes so we've got a nail polish
and it's silver and it's pretty and I
love silver nail polish okay so it's one
of those where you have to pull the top
off and then let's look at the opacity
of it looks very nice I do apologize for
the lighting and the way that it looks
oh my gosh feel bad Nicholas hello good
to see you chippy doll says bought one
for five dollars at t.j.maxx one of the
Marc Jacobs nail polishes are you
serious
quirky Beauty says the same thing it's
originally $18 for the shades been at TJ
Maxx and Marshalls for $4.99
it must be being discontinued well that
makes me sad but it's still I mean if
it's good it's good but I'll check my my
TJ Maxx to see if I can um if I can find
more yes Julie this is my crybaby shirt

little okay is this is this okay I'm not
familiar very much with Marc Jacobs

thing is I don't want to
open it and swatch it if I don't think
that I will wear it I don't know well I
wear this it smells like mint it smells
good swatch it okay lívia love says I
should swatch it yes it's a gloss but I
could see I could top this over
something okay I'm gonna keep it oh it's

Marc Jacobs of course la creme lip creme
this is a lipstick I love Marc Jacobs
lipsticks oh oh I'm excited please be
good shade please be could she please be
a good sheet please please please oh oh
it's neon pink does it have to be me on
this is the shade Clara
so maybe it's just the lighting but I
don't wear these kinds of shades and I
love this formula that makes me so
because I love this I love it look it's
magnetic yeah total 80s lipstick Harmon
absolutely April says full price is $30
so we're at 30 28 and 18 so we're
definitely way past the the $45 and work
at this point I've got one thing left
it's this one
assesses it looks like Sophia from here
that must be another shades Carmen says
give it to me Lizzy says how is
supernatural somebody missed it I don't
watch it on Thursday I watch it on
Friday when I edit what's up and make up
so I won't watch it till tomorrow on
their app okay what is it oh it's a
crayon look at this and that cute it's
metal that's not where it actually is I
think it's an eyeliner twinkle pop I
stick and this is in the shade what the
world Shoshana Shoshana let's see what
you are so Sean not whoa
I think it's an ice is that an eyeshadow
stick I think it's an eyeshadow stick it
is it's an eyeshadow stick ooh that's
fun
oh that's fun how fun like to lay this
down as a base it's not very opaque
though hmm well I don't know anything
like this so I'm excited to try it and
like lay it it's very wet but like lay
this down is it face and then kind of
build on top of it it's like a gray
toned blue very nice I'd rather that in
like a neon blue so that makes me happy
it's it is kind of Oh Mara Mara Mara my
friend Mara says spells it the same way
and she says Maris I'm gonna say Mary
hope that's right I said that it was
sheer and Steph says I love Marc Jacobs
lipsticks their life I know they're so
nice I'm so bummed
and then rune brownie says it's $28 for
this so Jay wants to know have you seen
the more Femi makeup brush subscription
box I have seen it I don't think I'm
gonna get it I don't think so is it
duochrome I don't think so
it looks just blue blue with maybe a
little bit of silver in it let me look
eyes I got the light all the way over
here now that's just the one yeah it's a
Pringle pop shadow stick yeah Steph okay
so we've got this blue I think that's
gonna look really nice and someone that
faded really fast said that it was a
holiday color which is true I could use
this for like a like a snowball kind of
like Elsa look or whatever so not that I
look anything like also but you know
okay so I'm excited
about this I wasn't excited about this
so I put it on and now I'm excited about
this I'm excited about this even though
t.j.maxx or $4 I cannot believe that I
can't believe that audience has I'm
gorgeous thank you I don't feel very
gorgeous today do you ever have those
days where you like a look at yourself
and you're like yeah I'm not having a
good face stage today that's the way I
feel today I'm definitely not having a
good face day but we all get those days
you know what I mean so I'm very excited
about these three things this
unfortunately was would be the thing
that I'd be most excited about but it's
a shade that I will never ever wear in
life so I'm not going to swatch it I'm
going to pass this on to someone that
will use it because these things are not
returnable so this will make a very very
nice gift for someone
so they'll save me some money there
because I think I already have in mind
who I'm going to gift it to that will
really like that that's more of her
shade than mine
so yeah so overall I definitely think
this was worth $45 even if it is stuff
that's probably being discontinued
I mean Marc Jacobs really does make some
very good quality stuff I wish I got in
like a little pallet or something like
some kind of eyeshadow palette but you
know Rhonda says potato days that is a
great way I'm gonna put that in my back
pocket I'm saving that for another day
for that but yeah I am I am very happy
with this I've habit by 45 dollar
purchase I think is totally worth it if
they did it again I would totally do it
we do have another mystery unboxing
coming up Monique wanted to know yes I
do I have a two-faced mystery box that I
ordered I have not gotten shipping
confirmation right so I don't know when
that's going to be but yeah so yeah it
was really good so thank you guys so
much for joining me for my mystery box
unboxing I am very very happy Thank You

your mystery box this was purchased by

Jacobs at all I don't need to affiliate
