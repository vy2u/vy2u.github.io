sad sad day I'm very sentimental okay
I'm a very sentimental person I'm a very
loyal person I don't end things well and
if you've been around my channel for a
while you know I used to be what is
going on there I used to be a very I
used to be a subscription box channel
which I mostly did subscription box
openings and then everybody in the
grandmother started doing them sponsored
and my content got lost in the mix used
to just be a few of us doing
subscription boxes but but yeah Birchbox
used to be steep Al's man like I I went
to the Birchbox shop and they gave me
you know well I think they mailed me
some products they do like I'll review
for them of their from their store and
then I went to their store and they were
like the girl did my hair and didn't
even charge me for it which was so nice
and you know I mean it was like you know
we were like this me and Birchbox and
I'm sad because I don't like it anymore
I don't
and what pushed me over the edge was
this and I know this probably not
Birchbox is fault but it is Birchbox is
fault because they should know before
they send something out this is the wish
botanical primer and I was like okay see
wish usually makes like a lot of like
lotions and stuff like that I was like
oh it's a face primer cool supposed to
have point five fluid ounces in it
there you go finally some came out this
thing is like three quarters of the way
empty and now of course I've wasted what
I've used what one I would have used
what I've squirted it out but it was
like really really I mean I I just rub
it in my hands I were to put some of my
face it actually feels quite nice what
does a cup I'm paying $10 a month for a
subscription and the stuff is either
stuff I won't use or stuff that I'm I
you know I don't feel like there's
enough product in there for me to trying
to get a good feeling about it then
what's the point you know what I mean
it's I'm really sad
very very sad sad day for me with
Birchbox I do want to tell you a channel
update very quickly that I meant to
mention in live chat yesterday while I
opened this up is that I'm gonna change
my uploading schedule I was putting up
Monday Wednesday and Friday I was
putting up content that was like edited
videos and then I was doing you know the
makeup minute Monday through Friday and
then what's it been makeup on Sunday and
the thing is when I got rid of what the
K I just I couldn't I just can't keep up
with that schedule I have like no free
time you know it's like there's no free
time to my dog shakin there's no free
time to do anything that I enjoy and I'm
starting to burn out and I don't want to
burn out because I love this job and I
love doing this and I think that I would
be happier overall if I just did the two
edited videos a month I think that would
be a month a week I think that would
make me just in general less stressed
and happy because then I feel like
sometimes I feel like I need to put out
content that isn't as good as it should
be because I'm trying to stay on the
schedule and I don't want to do that I
want to put up awesome content so I feel
like the best way for me to do that is
just to cut back on my schedule so - I'm
gonna shoot for Tuesdays and Thursdays
to do the edited content instead of
Monday Wednesday Friday because it's
just it's just too much with what's up
in make up I get I kind of have all fond
Sundays meaning I have you know I do
chat and then I try to take the rest of
the day off of my family but I usually
end up editing all night Sunday night
and I would really like to have just one
night that I can like go downstairs and
play on my xbox that my kids got for
Christmas
my xbox our Xbox are like watch them on
Netflix or something like it would be
nice to have one night and you know I'm
not getting that and I feel like I need
to cut back so hopefully you understand
all right
so let me go ahead and say hello to the
people that are here really quickly I
have some really nice comments coming oh
the other thing is hopefully the mic is
working I'm having some issues with the
connectivity of the mic and the software
that I'm using and it's like I can't
tell right now whether the mic is
working or not I won't be able to tell
this oldest livestreams over
so good morning to Jess hello my friend
Ashley and Daniela and Tim and manda
good morning to you and Whitney Manda's
here for two live chats in a row and
Cassie and Tonya and Amy and Laura and
Chelsie and Anna and Noah thank you so
much for being here Celeste and Consuelo
and Charlie and Lori and everybody else
thank you so much for being here if I
didn't say hello to you hello to you
thank you for being here so yes we do
have an Xbox one we just got that for
Christmas I've been playing life is
strange and dreamfall chapters those are
the kind of games I like to play I like
the adventure games and let me say I had
some serious I was playing life is
strange and I like something happened
and I seriously felt like I had totally
messed up somebody's life and I felt
really bad about it because I made a bad
choice and I ruined somebody's life
it feels so real to plug it all right
but anyway it's like a roleplay game
where you make choices and the path
changes depending on what you choose to
do but anyway there's the ones that I
like the best but anyway all right
Birchbox
what's going to this for five minutes
and I haven't even opened the birch box
but this is probably my last one I think
I'm gonna cancel it which kills me all
right
yeah we're canceling this is okay we've
got a lip balm got arrow boost color
enhancing lip balm let's put it on whoo
it's purple yeah that's interesting
I know Leigh Natalie's waving at me
tonisha says family first they don't
understand they don't have kids and I
think that does make a huge difference
how do my lips look I have no mirror do
I look color-enhanced
nothing oh if Kourtney says it's not
gonna look purple on the lips that's
good to know
it feels really good it's minty I kind
of like the way that it feels I mean but
if you think about it this by itself is
probably worth at least five bucks
monetarily I mean a lip balm a nice lip
balm is probably gonna cost by bugs
oh it says it's $14 that's crazy I would
never pay $14 for this but you know
everybody's saying it's clear not purple
that's cool because I can't see anything
oh the beauty Jack says that love arrow
boosts lip balms very hydrating nice
sheer color well there you go and it
does feel really good maybe I'm gonna
keep Birchbox with no I can't now he
said I'm not gonna do it so I gotta
stick with what I said okay
comfort zone hide your memory cream gel
24-hour double hydration cream gel what
is this
it's full-size of $60 packs hyaluronic
acid and Moringa oil offer a serious
hydration well that's cool let's try
this see how it feels you know Kourtney
says the same thing she says I don't
have kids but I prioritize my prioritize
my family my dogs might work and I'm
blogging yeah and I think I need to
prioritize me you know and having a
little bit more me time because I feel
like I am spending time with my kids
I might have used too much because this
seems really thick I'm not wearing any
foundation wearing some eyeshadow but no
foundation I'm testing out the sugar
palette by the shop push had sent me it
feels it feels nice it's got a strong
scent but it feels it feels nice it's
not bad it feels nice I don't think I
would buy a full-size of it for what was
that how much was it $60 I don't know
about that but I do like Marengo oil as
an ingredient hyaluronic acid you know
some people say hyaluronic acid does
something and some people say that it
doesn't do anything I am a believer in
from the research I've done that it does
something but not as much as what people
claim that it does Laura says girl if
you never refill your tank you have
nothing to pour out to everyone else
around you and I think that's what's
happening more because I'm like I don't
know if you can tell but I'm like really
kind of down in the dumps today like I'm
just you know I mean it's just like I
was telling my husband last night you
know it's it's a lot of little things
you know they really don't matter in the
law I mean it's little little tiny
things but when you got like 10 or 15
little tiny things that are picking at
you it's like easy so I think that that
rearranging my schedule a little bit
will good it will be good so okay so
that's really strong scented I
definitely wouldn't purchase a full-size
just because of that
but it's not bad I mean it definitely
it's already seeped into my skin it
feels good so there you go that's cool
okay so this oh we got a nut so there's
two face masks and a face masters to
hydrating things this is the verb
hydrating mask lightweight treatment
ideal for all oh it's hair that's why I
got a read up to read hydrating mask
it's for hair which I love hair masks
so obviously conditions and amps up
shine without weighing your hair down so
cool this I will definitely you know
this will be good for travel you know to
put in you know my bag because I always
never know what to do with like hair
masks like because I have like travel
bottles but then cleaning those things
out are kind of a pain in the butt I'm
learning so this would be good I think I
would try it once first just to make
sure that it's good but yeah I'll try it
once just to make sure it's go before I
bring it for travel but this would be
good for travel Rose says your typical
working mom worrying about others and
taking care of yourself safe self-care
is important I think that it is and I
think my big worry is that that you know
there's a group of people that believe
that I'm lazy and that I don't work hard
and what do I do all day long you know
and it bothers me it genuinely bothers
me because I work really hard all day
long and I work really hard all night
long and I don't get much break I mean I
I love what I do and that's why I work
so hard at it
is because I really enjoy it and I
really want it to be good and it hurts
my feelings when people say that I'm
lazy because I only put up you know I
don't put up as many reviews as some
people put up you know so that's I think
why I haven't I've been pushing myself
to do the three videos a week is because
I just don't I hate that criticism
because I don't feel it to be true
because they don't know how many hours
I'm working and how how focused I am and
how I'm trying to get this really good
content up you know because the research
behind my videos takes hours and hours
and hours and hours and then the film
then the getting ready and then the
filming you know and I love it don't get
me wrong I absolutely love it but I need
to like have some time where I'm not
doing YouTube you know and I'm not
cooking dinner for my family cuz I cook
up like a fresh meal for my family for
dinner every night so I mean a lot of
people do but you know what I'm saying
like it's it takes time
you know and I spend time with my kids
and all that and I make that a priority
and I'm not making myself a priority but
anyway okay this has been like this is
me just a blue boo boo boo boo I'm sorry
if it sounds like I'm whining I really
don't mean to I'm just trying to like
explain why Matt and I'm just not in a
good mental head state right this second
so Smashbox cosmetics photo finish
radiance primer no that is not what this
is oh yes that's what it is I've never
tried a radiance primer I do like
Smashbox primers overall a lot but I've
never tried a radiance primer I always
get scared with radiance primers I get
scared that they're going to be too
shiny you know like that it's gonna make
my face look like I have an excess of
oil when I don't but that really doesn't
look radiance like so that's kind of
cool so maybe it'll look good I don't
know if you can even see it I can't
really see it any kind of shine or
anything you put my glasses back on and
see if I can see when my glasses on but
I don't really see like can you see the
difference through my hand this one has
the radiance primer and this one has
nothing can you see the difference is
one more radiant than the other I don't
know but we'll definitely try and I'm
excited to try this see now Birchbox
it's doing good and now it's like I kind
of don't want to cancel it because this
one's pretty good
is it worth $10 though Jen really every
month really that's what I need to
decide Devon says very slight Cheryl
says a little bit but not much
Shelley oh hi Shelley from Shelley says
the days here she said I only used a
little bit my foundation but she but use
a different primer on my face okay
gotcha so you put it you mix it into
your foundation okay good to know I'll
try that
Allyson says I like to use that on the
high points when I'm not wearing makeup
well that's cool okay Rosanna says
radiant skin is so trendy this winter
yeah
Kim's quest I can only imagine how hard
additive video can be plus the research
you do in your edit on top of it yeah I
mean I try I try really hard and the
thing is is I really do enjoy doing it
and that's why I do it but sometimes I
need a little bit of time just for me
you know to do something that's mindless
because it's it's a lot of thinking and
sometimes
don't want thing sometimes I just want
to zone out no point do something that
doesn't take a lot
all right so this is by deuce I think
that's how you pronounce it free Matic
eyeshadow it's a very small little pan
and it says the full size is $10 do a
little smooch hmm it's got some shimmer
in it it's not very pigmented this is
not something I think I will use my
friend Mary Lynn's daughter I've been
giving her a lot of my stuff like this
that I swatch and you know once I swatch
it I can't give I don't give it away to
somebody that I don't know really really
well but she appreciates everything so I
might pass this on to her and she can
get rid of it if she doesn't want it but
it's got some sparkle in it this is
definitely not my style and it took two
swatches to build it up of course on the
eye it may be different and I already
have eyeshadow on so I can't test that
but I'll probably pass this on to her
because I think that she might enjoy
this I don't know maybe she will she
doesn't she can just toss it okay so was
this worth ten dollars it would depend
on whether this is good or not I do like
the lip balm a lot the lip balm feels
great
is it color under my lips do look kind
of color enhance I'm looking on the
replay my lips look a little color
enhanced so that's cool
so there you go so if this is good and
I'm excited to try this so are these
things three things worth ten dollars
yeah I think they are for me they are I
think I'm still gonna cancel though
because it's like I get one box every
three or four months that I like and
that's just not worth $40 I mean like
for four months to get a box that I like
I just I don't know I mean like but
Birchbox is definitely they they can do
so much better and I wish that they
would open up their minds and I wish if
they're ever watching this which I don't
want I know they don't watch my videos
anymore I don't think they care I just
have this really negative feeling for
Birchbox since the past you know I don't
know
fear next Courtney says it's probably
worth $10 but you don't enjoy it so it's
not worth getting crappy boxes yeah I
think that's what it is and I don't know
I just have this negative feeling
towards Birchbox since my contact there
left and I tried to get in touch with
the people over there and they ignored
me you know they used to do really good
at making me feel special and important
and they just dropped me and I didn't
like that but I still say it's upstate
Subscribe because you know I still felt
very loyal to the brand but the fact
that they are you know when they
switched over people they weren't kind
to me about it and you know they just
brushed me off and then the boxes
haven't been good and you know I don't
think it's where they go I'm gonna
cancel it Natalie says she's getting a
load with velocity box I was getting
glossy box I'd gotten like a Groupon or
something for glossy box at one point
and I had it for a year and I didn't
really like it to be completely honest
so missus bungle 78 is here oMG made it
so live-streaming I think it's before
the end yes you did whoo Gigi says I
should give him the boot yeah Zara says
Birchbox UK sucks too good to know I
haven't tried the allure beauty box
Martha yet I used to get sample Society
which was the allure beauty box a while
ago I used to get that one but I haven't
gotten it since they switched over Sarah
and Emily are both saying boxycharm I do
do boxycharm
unboxings for boxy try them I'm a little
late for it this month because that a
lot of content I want to get up but
hopefully I'm gonna film that this week
probably tomorrow I'll film my monthly
favorites for January and my Birchbox
because those need to go up ASAP because
I do have an agreement with Birchbox
that I will upload a video every single
month even though they don't pay me they
just send me the box I have agreed to
doing that so but yeah definitely you
know I don't know definitely what I
don't even know well yeah I think I
think this one's done I'm gonna log on
now and cancel it but I won't still be
getting it see of course I'll still be
in my Birchbox and then I've got some
fun stuff coming up with fabfitfun that
does do sponsored content on my channel
I have two videos by for fabfitfun
coming up this in February that they're
very interesting so I'm curious to show
you the stuff that I got but
but yeah I'm gonna pop out of here thank
you so much for being here thank you for
the moral support and I know this is
gonna be interpreted by people that
don't like me in a negative way that's
fine you know kick me when I'm down it's
cool because that's that's what people
like to do that's one thing I've learned
is that the more on YouTube people show
that their human being the more people
will try to knock them down further and
I've seen it happen to multiple people
that the more human you are the more
they go after you and if I was in a
family-friendly channel I'd say
something to people like that but since
I am a family-friendly channel I'm gonna
keep my mouth closed but use your
imagination on that one for people that
are just gonna come at me for just to be
mean I think there's a breakdown
sometimes I think there's a breakdown
where I think people think people on
YouTube are fictional characters I think
that there's a brain breakdown where
they think we're not real people with
real feelings and you know it's it's
like talking to a character in a movie
or on a TV show and we're not characters
were people and I think that we people
that are mean online need to really
consider that they're talking to a human
being you know we have feelings I have
feelings and you know it's all good and
I'm gonna focus on the positive people
because there are 98% of the people that
watch my channel are flippin amazing
amazing people and they critique me when
I need to be critiqued they hold me
accountable they're kind and they're
wonderful and I appreciate all of you
that are not the 2% so thank you for
being here I love you guys so much and
mad love and I will see you in a video
very very soon coming up next is my
shout out to people under 5,000
subscribers hopefully they'll be up
tomorrow I'm working my butt off my butt
off on it the rest of the day and I'd
love to have that up for you tomorrow so
watch out for it it's a great video talk
to you guys soon I love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
