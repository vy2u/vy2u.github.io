livestream for today if you missed it
just a few minutes ago I did swatches
for the pretty vulgar pretty birdie eye
shadow palette so that can be found on
the channel hopefully it has rendered by
now and is up if it is not up it will be
up very very soon so the second video is
for the second thing that I got whoop
upside down and this is Christina's here
Connie's back um this is this a brand
new Sephora give me some nude lip set
it's $28 at Sephora and we're gonna do
some more swatches cuz launch is your
fun Mia is here hello hello
Makita is here and there he sends us
here and Desiree is back again
jazz what's-her-name is back Lexus um I
really like the packaging I like the the
color like all the like little it's
almost looks like lip swatches it's
pretty cool Hannah's here Hannah's here
Hannah's here oops I just spilled it
work okay they put this little ball like
what is that what even is that like what
is the point of this why does this exist
this is dumb like it's one thing if they
put like a nice bed of the of the little
shreddy thingies but put a little ball
of it what even is that I don't even
know but anyway I love that this looks
like little lip swatches here I think
that's pretty cool
um Tyra says these are my favorite sets
to buy me too okay so first we have B
should we try these on maybe we should
try these on hopefully I can let's do
I've got my Bioderma here and I've got
my rag so let me just take off my lip
product I have a Shaunie's um it's
called tattoo by Ronnie cosmetics see
the sparkle on if you can still see it a
little spark there to wearing it for a
while
happy to have you here Amanda new
subscriber Jane welcome and let us do
some lip swatches so I can give you like
texture and all that so we're gonna
start with the Too Faced lip injection
glossy kara says I saved those lip boxes
I don't know why cuz they're pretty and
it's hard to throw things away that are
pretty alright I'm gonna have to use the
screen here to put on because I didn't
bring a mirror
Mellisa love topaz so the Rani Cosmetics
I'm doing a full review on them I have
some I have lots to share with you and I
can't like really break it down overall
they're pretty good though all right
here we go
oh it smells funky it smells weird I
know that smell is what is that I was
wondering if these lip injection
velocities would would sting this is in
the shade spice girl by the way I don't
feel anything yet but sometimes they can
Erin says they are painful so this is
the lip injection glossy in spice girl
and I'm starting to feel it make up
maverick says I hate those they burn so
bad
Tracy says it does sting so roopa that
oh yeah I just said you probably heard
it I think it looks pretty though and it
feels a little bit thick but not so bad
no burning yet maybe a tiny bit like
right here
I definitely feel some burning like
right here but it's definitely not as
bad at the extreme like I did the full
review of the lip injection extreme and
that stuff was intense but I can tell
that this would bother some people
tourists says they don't last long but
it just feels like a typical gloss it
looks like a typical gloss it smells
very odd I don't want to try those
because of the pain of it burned that
shouldn't be on my lips it's usually
just like cinnamon a lot of the extracts
they use is like cinnamon and stuff like
that um you see Shelby said gave her
lips a horrible reaction ooh um I don't
know if it's the same one you got in
support of Sephora play this the
stinging I can feel a little bit more
intense now so if you don't like that if
you're worried about that like it feels
like um I don't know like a like a light
Burnie tingly kind of feeling so yeah I
mean I like the color I mean but is it
anything magical not really not in my
opinion so let's go ahead and take this
off Alexandra said her mom got a bad
reaction - oh my goodness and brandy
says she bought it mostly for the NARS
okay how long before it stops the burn I
can't tell you about this one because
I'm taking it off but the extreme takes
about 3 to 4 minutes and then it's
completely gone so makeup bagra says I
love using the
la Schmidt lip scrub it makes your lips
so plump nice alright next one I see is
the Anasazi of Beverly Hills Kristen lip
gloss
and it looks like this me hold it over
in the lights you can see better um well
milk help with the burn it probably
would actually I can still feel the burn
by the way the smell was weird it
smelled like laundry like laundry that's
been sitting around in a closet for like
years that's what it smells like to me
it smells weird it's a very weird scent
hi Stevie's girl with hi Lisa
yes it's brand new it's definitely it's
yes it's still available and I saw it in
store yesterday mmm that's pretty I know
you're not supposed to mall yeah like
mothballs maybe a little bit not really
like mothballs oh I'm got a little funky
going on here
I like that color colors really pretty I
all I can feel as the sting hopefully
that's not from this to UM heaviness is
about the same as from the lip injection
it's kind of a mid-level heavy I really
liked the shade a lot again this is a
shade Kristin no stickiness just very
very very very smooth and I really like
the shade of it um two-face uses I don't
know how's that cap cap a sin yes which
one makes chili so hot yes that's right
you're absolutely right very good thank
you for the reminder on that I do like
this color it makes me happy but it's an
ADA look it's a gloss it's a lip gloss
so I'm assuming the lasting power
wouldn't be fabulous Thank You Ashley
she's like looks beautiful on me yes
even want the kit now Lisa okay I'm
gonna take it off cap sayin cap sayin
marry sim says um kara said I got some
genuine on your suggestion I love them
aren't they fabulous below the gen nudes
hey Cassie Cassie from thrift pick in
the house
cap sayin thank you very grunge alright
so let's try actually let's go light
let's keep going light we'll save the
dark ones for last just think it's we
have some staining well I don't know if
they're all glosses honestly I barely
even read what was in here before I got
it I just saw it and I was really
excited to see it I don't know is on the
back here I have to peel it up we're
gonna find out okay this is a Marc
Jacobs it looks like a gloss to I guess
I'm gonna have to peel this thing up to
find out alright let's see I'm gonna me
okay so we have the Anasazi Beverly
Hills lip gloss and Kristen Marc Jacobs
Cosmetics high shine lip lacquer in
sugar sugar NARS Velvet lip glide and
found Tarte lip lingerie matte tint in
revealed two-faced lip injection glossy
and Spice Girl and Urban Decay vice
waterproof long lasting liquid lipstick
in trivial so no they're not all glosses
so this is the Marc Jacobs because
there's no label on here except for that
says Marc Jacobs this is the high and
high shine lip lacquer in sugar sugar so
let's try it
hi Wendy okay let's try it I'm gonna a
little funky going on over here right I
don't know why I keep making that
meringue it sound ooh that's a very
weird it look very weird but blended in
nicely this one smells nice it smells a
little minty little sweet again like a
medium heaviness um very smooth I feel
like the anastacio was a little smoother
but it's still very very smooth feels
good does it feel like it's super
expensive no it feels nice yes the kids
are in store Vanessa
they said they were liquid lipsticks but
now I'm getting disappointed they're all
gloss yeah those three are glosses and
it really doesn't look that much
different than the the lip injection did
I can still feel the burn on my lips by
the way
nope not sticky at all not sticky at all
just very smooth craddle says so much
positivity here making my day oh that's
good I liked it I like to keep it
positive whenever possible so I'm gonna
go and wipe this off Amy says the
two-faced gloss is awful for her
Ajay's girl says it looks natural mm-hmm
definitely I'm gonna do arm swatches on
all of them when we're done we'll put it
just right here so you can see I still
have a little bit of pretty vulgar going
on right there um okay so now let's go
to the NARS this is bound this is a
velvet lip Glide Toby's still here
Toby's in the house
all right here we go I like the
applicator on this it's very soft but
again it's like a glossy kind of up
these back from be dreamcatcher all
right got V and Cassie in the house all
right I really like that color I don't
know if it's gonna dry down I feel like
I should wait a minute and see if it
dries down because I'm not familiar with
this formula the velvet lip glide but
this one is a little bit thinner feeling
it's not as thick um definitely very
soft I love the picture back on thank
you my husband loves this artist hi
Michelle you have to know the name of
the artist to make the picks in there
hey John kaya Koopman she's from
California the lip glide doesn't dry
down Vanessa says thank you oh yay
Larissa is that Larissa Larissa mallya
yay happy to have you here say it again
CAI a is the artist kaya Koopman so yes
lots of great people here Aspen
absolutely Michelle so it's definitely
lighter on the lips um it feels a little
more oily but not oily
it doesn't feel Willy but it's not quite
as thick or like silicone II feeling you
know it feels silicone silicone is on
the right word because it still got a
lot of slip it's just a thinner formula
Oh hugs back to Peru all right pretty
color really like the shade there really
isn't a lot of shade variations so far
we've got light and lighter so thanks
Cassie I like this one too
Wendy says she's wiring a Hollywood
vanity mirror as she watches no it does
not feel dry at all nope not at all
is it like a comfort mat it's oily er
than that so nude as a nude well this is
the thing as nude as nude is new
depending on what color you are when
you're nude because there's so many
different skin tones out there you know
what I mean and I feel like these are
all like light-skinned nudes and now
we're getting into some medium and
deeper skin nudes but there's only two
you know all right so let's do the Urban
Decay liquid lipstick this looks like a
full-size this is a full-size cuz if
this thing's awesome then that's pretty
stinkin good as says point one seven
fluid ounce five point three mol eaters
I think that's a full-size Wow because
this $28 for the whole thing and what is
this twenty two or twenty by itself wow
Cattell impulse buying didn't even read
it all right here we go scent is mildly
plasticky but not bad it's not strong
the worst-smelling one was the anasazi
one on what was it without mmm alright
here we go
this is still very light well I think
this would look nicer on more skin tones
though applicator is really soft and
it's bent do you see that how the app
hairs bent I really like that shade
really liked that shade I like that a
lot
that one's super pretty I think this is
my favorite this is in the shade trivial
vise waterproof long lasting liquid
lipstick we'll give it a minute to dry
down so it's it's a pinky er than the
other ones but yeah it's beautiful love
the shade I've never tried this formula
either okay can feel it's starting to
dry down and get a little sticky Thank
You Toby HD scroll so there's nothing
wrong with impulse buying once in a
while I've been a little bit worse
lately than I typically am is that matte
one of the sparkly ones
let's look let's cheat let's look uh
two-face no Urban Decay
it just says waterproof long lasting
liquid lipstick and trivial I can feel
it getting a little sticky but it's not
bad
Thank You Jill they all crack they do
mmm he says some of those Urban Decay
said they were map they said there
shimmers in them it looks like those
shimmer in this one it doesn't look like
there's Matt it's the lighting is not
very good here hold on a minute
the box is super cute isn't it Andrea I
love it too all right let me I'm gonna
shine some light on it I'm not just
going on my phone to goof around I
promise I'm going to turn on the
flashlight here and see if I can get
some light on this thing yeah there's
sparkles in here I don't know if you can
you can't you guys can't see that it's
all blown out for you but there's
definitely sparkles in here
definitely NARS bound is your obsession
Jerry good to know I do really like it a
lot I do wish that there were more
deeper skin tone nudes in here they all
seemed very light skin tone
definitely not bored LexA definitely not
bored never jazz says I have the
metallized liquid lips and UD and
they're so nice it's definitely not as
hydrating the other ones the other ones
are definitely more comfortable than
this one but this one's more of a liquid
lipstick and those are more of a gloss
so I'm assuming that this one would be
longer-lasting
um except for that I did read that the
cracks I have this kit loving all the
colors usually I don't buy these because
I only wear nudes gotcha right huh BAM
oh mama mmm totally kiss proof
completely hope that wasn't a good test
that's awesome very nice
that is super cool yes okay this is the
one I'm really excited about this might
have just made it worth it
this one right here but we'll have to
see how it wears so we'll say okay have
I tried by beauty lipsticks yes I love
them they're very nice but relatively
typical liquid lipstick formulas hi
Cheyenne
they might look too light on you
Cheyenne they might be but they did make
some more deeper skin friendly ones in
the past but I don't know just thanks
man
all right I should do a wear test for
flaking ooh
Bioderma does not taste very good it's
not even coming off with the Bioderma I
might need some oil uh he says if I
beauty comes out with a liquid lipstick
I'm so down I don't know why they
haven't already all right it's not
coming off don't describe your lips off
hey it's exfoliation tastes terrible
the Bioderma yeah okay you probably need
some oil to really fully remove that
what do you see it's like flaking off
that's not good
magic erasure cloth I said I didn't
bring that down cuz I wasn't expecting
it to be this hardcore you know that's
disgusting looking organic coconut oil
is the best yes it's true coconut oil
does work great okay we're just gonna go
with it we're gonna pretend like it
completely came off because I don't
think it's gonna impede on this product
too much this is the deep skin friendly
one or I should say deep skin friendly
because deep skin tones can wear those
but this is one that's more it's closer
to a deep skin tone for a nude this is
the Tarte lip lingerie matte tint and
revealed so let's try it I hope it
doesn't wear like that too OOP that's
right
hmm I missed that was my fault oh I love
this color oh I love that color that's
really pretty and it's got a little bit
of a minty scent if you've never tried
these yes it's a nude yes I mean it's
got a little bit of red in it for a nude
I feel like it's got a lot of red um but
I do really like it definitely love it
for fall live I'm totally with you on
that I really like it but I agree it's
very red for a nude I would think it'd
be more Brown rather than bread but it's
pretty matches my shirt so I like it
stuff really likely she said knockout
yeah I like this one a lot so and I've
used this formula before and I do really
enjoy it it's not particularly long
lasting or long wearing it's very
typical lipstick II so um just job
before bolder nudes on me I don't think
he cares
if you're fully honest hey John depends
on the occasion he says he's listening I
didn't really she was listening
yeah Jessica's here Thank You Felicia
all right so let's give the final
breakdown on this we've been doing this
17 minutes holy moly this a long video
okay so break it down the lip injection
you're really going it's very clear it's
there Zoe you know what let's do the arm
swatches while we talk about them so
we've got the Too Faced glossy lip
injection and that's what that looks
like it totally went it became
relatively transparent on my lips if you
do feel that tingle that that tingle is
finally gone off my lips but if you
don't like that pain experience you
won't like these some people really like
that though so to each her own the
anastacio feels really smells really
funky like it's not mothballs it's
definitely not mothballs it just I don't
know it just smells like an old closet
to me I don't know why um but I really
like the shade it's a little bit deeper
I guess this one's could be a little bit
more for like a medium skin tone as far
as like nude wise
but I like I like the way it feels but
it's very glossy feeling it's very
smooth and so is that other one the Marc
Jacobs is very similar I wish that they
hadn't put both of these in here both of
these shades because I feel like they're
extremely similar just this one has the
spice and this one doesn't have the
spice Colleen says Anasazi glasses are
so sticky see mine did not feel sticky
maybe they've reformulated I don't know
but it didn't feel sticky to me so you
can see it it's like they're almost
exactly the same shade like I wish that
they had put like a deeper color of
brown with this that would have been I
think a better choice this is probably
my favorite in there oh and by the way
these two feel very very very similar
the Marc Jacobs in the anastacio the
feeling is the same it's very smooth
very mm Gretl says til 90s 5 I need it
yes and then we've got the vise liquid
lipstick this one is my favorite of the
set and I feel like this is what totally
makes it worth it really liked this a
lot but this one is is the transfer
proof it really was on me very transfer
proof and it
there's no funky smell to it or anything
but it isn't as hydrating it isn't as
smooth things like that and then the
last one the NARS bound I also really
liked this one this one smells good that
looks like that so those are the shades
all open up there's one more this one
more honest one and then this one was
also very very smooth so the only
long-lasting lip you're going to get in
here is the Vice the Urban Decay
everything else is going to be glossy
it's going to wear off like a typical
lipstick or gloss and then the last one
is the chart and this one has that minty
scent and there's a lot more read on it
on the lips than I expected but I do
like this formula a lot it's just not
super long wearing I'm curious to know
how these would how this would wear down
over time but overall I'm happy that I
got this I think was definitely worth
$28 I think I'm gonna get a lot of use
out of it and I'm very very happy with
it so I hope this was very helpful for
you I know it was helpful for me
learning about these products from you
and talking to you guys about it and why
are people so mean you mean go away cuz
I'm 38 years old meanie she's commenting
on my forehead line she has forehead
lines
me block goodbye goodbye mean person
okay
um anyway I probably shouldn't have
blocked her now thinking about it wasn't
like she was just commenting a fact I'm
the one who got defensive about it that
wasn't her fault that was my fault
anyway I hope that this was very very
helpful and thank you for being here and
if you didn't watch the pretty vulgar
one you can feel free to go ahead and
watch that one that just went live not
too long before this one and this is a
really long video so I'm gonna say
goodbye mad love and I will see you guys
soon bye everybody have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
