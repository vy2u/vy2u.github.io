should be live for some reason it's not
saying it's live but it might be maybe
it is hello my friends I think it's um
yeah it is it's working yes
Swedes hello my friends welcome to an
impromptu livestream of my ipsy
unbagging I thought it would be fun to
do something a little different I know
not everybody can show up for live
streams at 10 o'clock in the morning
Eastern Time I know that that is a very
inconvenient time for a lot of people I
know this is impromptu I know I did not
plan this I mean one ounce ahead of time
but I figured I would just pop on anyway
and kind of give you a little rundown of
what I got in my Ipsy bag I haven't open
it yet it's completely sealed I can't
show you that side cuz it's got my
address on it actually I can go like
this I'm sure you that it is completely
sealed I have no idea what's in it I
didn't look at the sneak peeks and I'm
excited to share it with you I do have
one one product I want to update you one
from last month this is the Luna crayon
yeah this tab came off and it got all
over the bag I had it in and the cap
does not stay on very well like you have
to smash it down and even then it comes
off fairly easily so it got all left I
had you wipe it off cousin had like all
this dirt and dust all over it and the
color was like this baby pink I filmed
the video today so I've got already
enough swatch I don't know if you can
see it but it looked terrible on me it
looked like just so that's gonna be a no
I'm gonna sanitize it and try to pass it
on to somebody if somebody wants it but
I'm feeling I like I don't even want to
pass it on anybody because it's just
it's not a functional product but the
way the cap comes off I don't know if
you know but I want to give you feedback
on that I haven't only tried yet a
college a whole lot I have used the
smash box lid primer a little bit and
the hey honey the UH concealer nothing
terrible happen so far but I have no
nothing raving to tell you about them
yet
but I think that's due to just me not
trying them enough but but nothing
terrible yet nothing bad to report this
is the only one with something by to
report from last month so the before I
unbox on bad whatever one call it I do
want to say how loads
that are in the collective brain of
makeup awesomeness this evening just to
say hi to the couple of people that were
here first and that way I feel like I'm
being kind to invite people into my home
I feel like it's nice enough to you know
I should say hello to some people so let
me go ahead and scroll all the way to
the top andrew is here Sabrina the
makeup mom in the hello hello crystal is
here
and Lee is here Naomi and pancakes in
salan Tori and Karina and Mimi's here
and Jordan and Vanessa and Tia and Judy
thank you so much for being on thank you
to everybody else for being here as well
I do have a boxycharm unboxing coming I
am actually doing that in collaboration
with my friend Tiffany dawn I was going
to film that today and things happened
and it did not get foam today I filmed
my Q&amp;amp;A video that took way longer than I
expected and I filmed my my collab the
brand that a bunch of influencers
collabed with Sally Beauty to put out a
makeup line and I have a few products to
show you that I had bought on
recommendation from coffee break with
Danny's video so that video was the
other one I film today and because my
Q&amp;amp;A took way longer than I expected it
didn't have time to do my on my box
attending box and so I need to like
Tiffany John know that because I feel
really bad that I didn't film it today
so I'm gonna try to film it tomorrow I'm
still gonna try to get up for you this
week but with Thanksgiving and I'm
hosting on Friday so I don't know if I'm
gonna be able to give up the seat at
very latest next week so Tiffany comes
in here telling another quite yet
because I haven't given up on that I
probably wouldn't gonna go live this
weekend so a couple minutes ago so but
anyway Oh Tabitha and the shower here
sorry table I didn't touched you I
figured even pewter was off I'm sorry my
friends I figure you computers off and
I'm gonna bother you you do so much and
they didn't want to bother me
well bad be honest I felt that happened
I figured you'd show up if you could if
your computer was on I felt bad
every shelter thank you for being okay I
did get one bonus item that I ordered I
actually ordered this not for myself but
for the woman who cuts my hair she loves
this stuff he it's a 10 miracle leave-in
spray spray stop so they leave in your
spray stuff I picked Emily what it does
whether it's a good protector I get
honest I can't remember you probably
know better than I do what this does
you're supposed to shampoo conditioner
hair towel dry spray product all over
hair and comb through but it doesn't say
what it does but I just remember that
she really likes this so I I got that
for her with my exes once and then this
is the FC bag I got I did get a blue one
which I'm very excited about Oh Tiffany
is here oh sorry to me I feel really bad
and I should have emailed you before I
went live and then I saw somebody was
asking about boxycharm and I wanted to
say why I wasn't putting enough yet but
thank you for understanding I appreciate
it so much
okay so here we go oh these like hot and
cup a hot tea with a shot at honey Jack
from a call and Jen live nice I love it
all right so let's see what we got what
is this there's no name line okay so
this is oh this is make make lip gloss
okay make sent me some of their role on
the foils and I really like them they're
almond oil based so I'm curious to try
something else from me it is a lip gloss
hopefully you'll be able to see it in
this terribly lighting after done one
it's very pretty maybe I'll put it on
it smells like mint no mirror makeup
challenge i doing Melanie said she
unsubscribed from the FC and that's a
for a play last month how did you like
it bristl says her Epps's should be here
tomorrow no ma'am hello Banshee news
Thank You Tiffany for understanding I
appreciate you I shall and mess up your
uploading schedule it is a little bit
thick a little bit sticky but it's very
nice
not not sticky on my lips but it just
feels very thick and very heavy
it smells minty but it doesn't feel
minty it doesn't feel like that plump
and feeling it feels quite nice actually
it's kind of thick though and the high
feel about it if you are not used to FC
by the way if you've never heard of FC
I'm like not even doing like the whole
FC what is FC think it's a $10 a month
beauty subscription I believe you can
get it in the US and Canada that's right
oh I'll be like strip oil very cool so
yeah so this this seems very nice I'm
happy to have that I like that it's
smaller because I feel like the lip
gloss I need to throw this away and like
in here because I'm zipping in out of it
so I don't mind a smaller lip gloss that
makes me happy okay so morning calming
cream what is that so
so rosy so the words name is print it's
all like broken up into calming clean
all day moisturizing for all skin types
untouched without the slightest
alteration or change just the way it is
this must be okay beauty brand that
doesn't make any sense to me I'm gonna
go trying stuff or I'm just tired oh
yeah I forget they don't give us the
products on the card
yep see you're of no help you have no
help so it's a morning it's a
moisturizer let's smell it
well it's got a double thing here where
it says I'm dropping the Birchbox
subscription for sure yeah I think that
as long as people are interested in the
unboxing them I will um I'll unbox them
and I'll keep getting them but if people
start stop watching them I'll probably
unsubscribe alright oh that's most
really nice it smells very strong though
so if you don't like strong scent whoo
it's very um body butter feeling as far
as like the thickness of it the texture
oh it's cooling glamorous Jasper what
Bristol likes my top thank you so much I
forget my god I know I got it for
Chandini mmm Alexandra says Jen I love
being in a Facebook group all positive
vibes also
we tried really hard don't we tab in
Michelle we tried very hard
we've got smells really good it smells
strong so you know like strong sense but
it's got a sweetness it's like a sweet
floral oh I love that
oh hi my friend Georgia Harris I do not
get support play
I don't Gigi wants to know is it's a
good for teens I would say absolutely I
would get tipsy for a team rather than
more than an adult and I would get ba
feet wrong more for an adult and I feel
like these little samples or the teams
are a lot of times very fickle and you
know wanting to move well I am too but
you know it's nice these little samples
Oh Liv is here from Liv loves her makeup
hi Liv I stopped all my subscriptions
looking for new cruelty-free ones good
for you girlfriend there are a few
cruelty-free ones I can't think of them
off the top of my head but I know there
are some closer food once there used to
be some a long time ago but I don't know
if they still exist I think the one that
I knew of that one doesn't exist anymore
the one that I I talked about you know
years ago
Shannon says if you can recommend one
out of Sephora play Birchbox or FC or
boxycharm well boxycharm I feel like is
a different animal because it is twice
as expensive if I had to pick between
those I would say box of trumpet is
twice as expensive because you get the
reason why I would pick it it's because
you get in full-size items and not one
where all the other ones you get sample
sizes I would definitely pick FC over
Birchbox and I only got two for play for
a month so I can't only talk about
support play but if I to choose between
FC and Birchbox the $10 descriptions
iPod FC tape your that's or how these I
probably butchered that PE TI TV oh you
are thank you and villa
I'm gonna call you in Villa I hope that
that's correct and Prince says cause box
creatively I haven't heard of that one
that's awesome and simply Bonnie says
what's your facebook group my facebook
group is called what's up and make up
this group stop palm slash facebook.com
slash group slash that's been makeup
alright let me get into the rest of
these products here okay so we have okay
this is manic adore why did I open that
one I didn't even know what it was oh
it's an HD perfecting powder you know
what now that I open it I'm not gonna
swatch it I'm gonna put this in for a
future giveaway because I have so many
of
powders I don't think anybody I don't
know if anybody be interested in the
review of this I haven't heard much
about this brand and because it's just a
finishing powder I'm just gonna let that
one go I don't I'd rather not waste it
it's very pretty print on there and I've
tried a lip product romantic a bar I did
like it
okay now we have Oh dawn says have you
heard of fabfitfun charging shipping no
no all right next one that's interesting
you know Oh touch and soul we have the
advanced real moisture liquid foundation
Wow definitely want to try this you know
I'm all about mighty beauty hmm let's
see the sheen let's rub that in a little
bit that's probably a little too much
that is very light it looks very full
coverage though can you see I would
think that you cover up my brow pencil
swatches from your holy moly that's
encourage right there Wow Wow Taylor
says did you see that they can see that
the support plate at the Sephora app has
old Sephora play bags wait wait oh no
I'm getting foundation on my computer
bundles that you can buy for $10 the
market is coming soon what Taylor
holy moly Sephora play app has old
Sephora played bunnies you can buy for
$10 that is really smart of them that is
very very smart I did get foundation on
my computer though hopefully you were
able to see the coverage of that it
looks and there it looks to be a little
really nice finish I'm very excited
about this hopefully people were able to
get their shade foundation is such a
hard thing to put in the subscription
box I will imagine for my skin tone it'd
be a little easier but especially from a
Kay beauty brand I would imagine that
would be very difficult maybe people can
use it as like a brightening concealer
if it's not you know too terribly light
or like an eyeshadow base maybe if it's
the wrong shade but I'm personally
excited cuz I'm lucky enough to be able
to find my shade I'm really nervous for
people that maybe couldn't get their
show you hopefully people cut off to
watch someone Baggins
and then the colour-pop pressed shadow
this is in the shade come come oh come
and get it okay let's see what other
people are saying
Oh Susan says I never catch a live chat
cuz I'm a mom of three under three in
Australia but I got lucky that you're on
mother napping oh that's wonderful I'm
so happy to have you here Susan okay so
this is me I shadow let's go ahead and
swatch this cuz I am gonna keep this I
do have a few color prep pop pressed
eyeshadows I have had kind of mixed
feelings about them but overall I find
them to be quite nice there's a little
bit of chunkiness going on let me swatch
it again it might have been just
something left over on my wrist
that's very pretty nice reject such I've
said you almost went are there for a
minute did I really I wasn't even paying
attention that's how that's all you know
I used to film in this way
Jenna's tired go to sleep stephanie says
what did I do off to watched on the
replay I don't even know what I did so
anyway that looks really pretty I'm
excited about that that's really pretty
so the question is is that everything I
think that's everything
oh sorry this i'm excited about this i'm
excited about this i'm excited about
this i'm excited about was that it oh
and this I'm not so is this worth $10
absolutely this one is definitely worth
$10 to me I am very very excited for
this oh my he says goodnight genuine
loved all not bad thank you so much for
that good night have a good sleep it
does kind of look like Urban Decay's
fireball doesn't it it's really pretty
I'm excited okay so yeah I definitely
think this was worth $10 I feel like I'm
like just for these the
I think is worth $10 to me I would
definitely buy saw these on a shot for
10 bucks and totally gathered especially
after smelling this because I don't mind
the scent in my skincare unless as long
as not too terribly strong I do have
some old swatches emit I'm just knows
that I'm alone but yeah I mean this this
looks great to me I'm excited for this I
fit last it's been a while since I've
had an episode that well I'm like yo
Scott yeah this is a win for me
definitely I mean I feel like this is
worth 5 bucks on its own for 5 bucks and
then this is what you know good 6 to 8
bucks and touching soul is an expensive
brand and then you guys know these are
worth what it's 5 bucks something like
that and then this was maybe 2 or 3
dollars probably more than that
monetarily so yeah win total win liberal
with lipstick says I like your bag I
just cancel my support play a few days
ago for EXCI I hope you like it
hi Katie oh she's talking to other
people trying talking me love Lori says
Jenna I always think the bag itself adds
so much of the value of F subscript and
love them for when I travel to organize
I definitely think that they can add to
this subscription I think they I use
these for gifts for people like when I
do smaller giveaways I'll put them in an
XC bag and show that they don't have
them but I show any bags like this at
this point that I personally don't add
this to my personal value because I
would never go out and buy a small bag
like this at this point cuz I just have
too many so I personally don't add if I
can definitely see why people would
consider this as part of the value and
this is a really cute look bad the
inside is very plastic II like it's very
cheap feeling on the inside like it
would rip relatively easily but the bag
itself on the outside seems quite nice
actually I mean for heard inexpensive
bag it's not fancy
alright guys I'm gonna go ahead and pop
all here for a bit for a bit so that's
all tired and I'm gonna go ahead and pop
off here but I'm so glad I got to catch
you guys in this late at night had some
new people happy Thanksgiving to you if
you're in the States
this necklace Gigi says necklace looks
back and when she opened it but it looks
great on yeah look I like it much better
now that I'm actually wearing it I'm
telling with you I got this in my fat
that fun that I unbox everybody
I've always talking about kimberly-clark
I love Camila she's amazing one day I
would love
maybe that'll be amazing Jonathan look
what is this what what happened Jen can
you look at the shade color on the
shadow the eyeshadow was called come &amp;amp;
get it is the name of the shadow I feel
bad like leaving so fast but it's been
17 minutes I should probably
if Seon Baggins really shouldn't be
zooming along but oh my schedule is off
completely off as far as my uploads but
your soft makeup minutes money through
Monday Tuesday Wednesday makeup minutes
possibly on Friday no what's the makeup
on Sunday and then I'm gonna get other
videos out too as soon as possible
hopefully tomorrow I'll have the Q&amp;amp;A up
if not on Wednesdays so Katie wants to
know if this is gold or silver it's like
a rose gold anyway I will talk to you

here

a great day or evening wherever you are
