livestream I love impromptu live streams
I'm starting to really dig on this
because it's fun and I get to talk to
you guys more often and people get to
watch it on the replay and see important
things like this palette right here this
was an impulse buy again I've been on
the impulse buy kick actually it wasn't
completely impulse buy because I've been
getting a lot of requests to review the
pretty vulgar line now individually this
is $35 so that's not so bad when like
you think about just the palace $35 but
if you shop at the whole line hi Natalie
hi Liv talk about the whole line it is
quite expensive when you start adding
things up
hi Cheryl hi Jamie have a good afternoon
Jamie so let's go ahead and open this
baby up I also was thinking about doing
a second live stream with this this is
the new Sephora give me some nude lip so
I think I'm gonna do two live streams
now thinking about it hi everybody okay
so I sound like Emily - Emily Nicole
goodness gracious can I get my people
together Emily no well he's only gonna
be well for a second Oh
janae new subscriber I've been waiting
for this oh good so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna do it the way that I
normally do I brought down two brushes I
brought my makeup geek foiled eyeshadow
brush and then I brought down my omnia
by royal and langnickel their UM shader
brush because I wasn't sure what would
pick up the product better and is
exciting Desiree I'm excited too so I'm
gonna go ahead and just swatch you guys
know I like my force so we're gonna do
four so we're gonna dual a free ego and
songbird and I'm just gonna swatch him
here because I feel like you can see
them best there and we'll leave a little
space for the brush swatch hmm if you
did not see um if you don't watched our
babies she did a review of the first
impression of the entire collection so
for the Matt I think I'm gonna pick that
up with this brush here Connie says she
missed the live uh because Kelly three
hours behind I know well that's why I
really like doing these a little bit
later - all right so let's brush swatch
lay whoops I did that in the wrong spot
there's no Prime or anything on my arm
um I don't know if you can see it but
that's the finger swatch and that's the
brush swatch I can see this Lange bleh
it's gold lay laying down on my eye
better than you can see it in the swatch
because it's blending in perfectly with
my skin tone so Lexus says I'm pretty
sure you can't even get this in the UK
but nevermind all I don't know go on
Sephora's website and see because I'm
pretty sure it can only be gotten at
Sephora I'm gonna switch brushes for the
shimmer shades and go into the makeup
geek foiled brush because it's just a
little bit more dense of a brush and
again this is first impression so first
impression is I agree with Tora and that
they definitely seem if I remind me of
anything I agree with her Too Faced as
far as the pigmentation goes which may
be a good thing or a bad thing depending
on what you like I'm probably is the
camera bit overrated so far so far not
so good so far not so good let's go back
into the foil brush for ego okay
I feel like this camera is picking it up
pretty well as far as two real-life the
only one I don't feel like it's
representing well is that first one that
lay because of my skin tone pretty
vulgar I believe is their own brands but
what taro was saying is that it says on
the back the same thing that it says on
on Too Faced packaging it says bulk made
in the USA assembled in the Dominican
Republic which is what it said on the
back of the natural new natural love
pallet natural love palette yes AJ says
she's a little underwhelmed so far me
too me too
welcome Mary Sims got your eye on the
brand Vanessa well we're gonna keep
swatching away okay so let's do songbird
and then we'll go back and with that
makeup geek flow brush now that looks
good that looks nice I'm going to go
ahead and try with the omnia brush with
the lighter shades and see if we can get
a little bit more let's go back into
free which is this one here seem to be
picking up a little bit better with the
omnia brush brush but not a lot better
let's try ego which is the one
underneath with the omnia yeah it seems
to be picking up better with this brush
so I think I'm gonna switch over and
just start using this brush and then if
we have a problem we'll go into the
makeup geek foiled so that's the first
four shades then now now those are the
more natural neutral looking shades
there's the wipe tests they wiped away
pretty easily I won rubbing pretty hard
to Ashley's here yay okay I rubbed
really hard but it completely came off
okay so let's start getting to the color
so we've got we're gonna do right here
we're gonna do brilliant they feel not
particularly solved or creamy they feel
a little gritty actually and this was
the one that Tara said felt really
gritty and it does I can feel the
texture I don't know if you can hear it
I don't know if you can hear that
texture I just really rub my finger in
that that's gonna come off crazy
packaging is beautiful isn't it it's
gorgeous packaging
but I don't know okay so here we go mmm
expecting that one to be a little more a
little more
um fee Deborah says it is just me but
all the neutrals are so many palettes
looking the same yeah they do look the
same I mean but how much damage
variation can we really get in neutrals
you know it's only so much we can do the
purple came out nice
these these look a little bit well no
all right let's go in with the omnia so
I like doing swatches with this but it's
a little fluffy so it doesn't work with
all with all shadows not as much powder
kick up as you may see him like a lorac
palette
see that's not kicking up a lot of
powder it's packed relatively tight
Natalie says sound looks a little cheap
Ashley says it's beautiful in the
setting spray oh oh talking about them
um something else Jamie said I saw Tara
swatch this as well I'm also wondering
if maybe they made the same lab as Too
Faced I shall palette is priced cheaper
than she based I wonder if is about the
same amount of product yeah I haven't
looked into the price per gram I'm
debating on whether I'm going to do a
full review of this just because I
didn't buy it with super check money I'm
not sure kind of depends on the demand
I'm really underwhelmed with this really
underwhelmed
all right wing it this is the blue I'm
I'm kind of disappointed in how gray
that looks
there's a lot of gray undertone there so
it is rough Annette okay and then snitch
which is the red yeah tar like the blush
and the bronzer the red looks like it'll
be nice oh happy to help willow it's why
I love these because I don't have to
like formally get everything ready in
order to film a formal video I can just
go with it so there's the next four i've
got brilliant fancy wing it and snitch
the red is not bad v is it the red the
red i think would work well but they're
definitely not particularly soft or
anything i blend away pretty pretty
easily mary says I bought the with
mascara is just for the packaging and
display packet and PAL it's
disappointing um Shelby says she really
likes the red alright let's keep going
so we've got four left I think I'm gonna
do well I don't lend you my other maybe
we'll do it on this side because I don't
we'll do it like right here on this side
so here we go are the pallets in store
to swatch I have no idea this one feels
smoother and softer fancy but not
definitely not more powdery or anything
but these fuel there's a grit to them
then I'm not expecting the shimmers are
definitely softer than the mattes to
make sure there's no weird scent or
anything and there isn't okay so there's
the swatches there oh yeah we're gonna
go on this side to make sure we have no
interference from previous watches these
look crazy pigmented that green though I
really like the green really like that
Willa says she's going to buy all three
but not getting another bad pallet just
cuz it's pretty uh here yeah I hear you
I don't feel like it's bad right now I'm
not in in bad eye shadow thoughts right
now but I'm definitely not impressed but
this last set look really good and
remember the red looked good too that
looks very nice these are much better
they're the deeper shades are definitely
much much better okay never more oh so
maybe if you have a deeper skin tone or
if you like deeper looks in general you
might dig on this a little bit more
because these deeper shades definitely
are more promising this shade jealous I
don't think I have anything like that
it's not swatching so well let's try
again there we go okay this part looks
good digging on these yes Veronica
we are VCB we are just doing the one
palette I only got one because I didn't
want to spend a hundred dollars on just
three Pet on the three palettes
that's not bad hi I'm work at Sephora
love you Jen so far not in store I work
at Hillsdale California but did buy the
eyeshadow palette okay I missed it was
been too fast okay so here we go Toby
says nope not gonna get it uh you can't
get it in Denmark very interested in my
opinion well I definitely am more
impressed with the deeper shades in the
lighter shades I did decide to get the
blue student light test real quick those
definitely won't these mm these aren't
bad this this one right here is intense
umm that's really intense see that's
what I was looking for as far as the
lasting power when I wipe it was these
two
that's formation and Nevermore um
what was a Masai I completely forgot my
train of thought but anyway one other
thing I want to mention that I noticed
and Torres too is just from doing that
you see how messy the packaging is
starting to get already this beautiful
packaging is already getting messy
so I wish that they have put some kind
of plastic film over top I've realized
my heads chopped off
I wish they had put some kind of plastic
kind of film over top so you're funny
with um so that they didn't get it
didn't get so messy so quickly you see
all that I noticed that what tourists -
okay so that is the pretty birdy palette
my final thoughts is I feel like it's a
pretty mean average performing palette
nothing spectacular oh I didn't get the
other ones the other two palettes
because I felt like those were ones that
we've seen those shades lecture than so
many times before and I wanted to get
the different one the one that's
different I didn't see this as being a
standalone palette I saw it more as a
supplemental palette to be used with
other palettes but honestly like I'm not
super impressed so far but I do have to
use it on my eyes I don't feel like it's
fair to completely judge a palette just
based on swatches I think on the eye
everything can change so I was
definitely I just got it just now so I
will definitely be playing with this so
yeah so that is a pretty birdie pretty
vulgar eyeshadow palette
uh hashtag free the bird any other
questions and things before I go I'm
gonna go ahead and pop off here intros
are necessary for every everybody never
get excited by them yeah I hear that
anything else we'll give it another 30
seconds or so and see if there's
anything else you guys wanted to know
before I sign off AJ says awesome way to
spend my lunch break yay Damaris says
the colors are the wrong season I can
see that but I think it's how you work
on though you might be able to work it
oh thank you Carmen I'm probably not
planning on getting the blush and things
yeah I'm with you um have a great
Tuesday to you TV I might well if I do
do a look with it it will probably be I
might put a look on Instagram and if I
do do a full review I'll do a demo like
I usually do
Maurine so did you get any other stuff
from the brand no this was all that I
got so oh you guys are so sweet yeah I'm
gonna try it Gretel I'm gonna try to do
a look with it you have $35 okay I'm
gonna go ahead and pop off of here but
I'm gonna be right back because I want
to do a second video on the Sephora give
