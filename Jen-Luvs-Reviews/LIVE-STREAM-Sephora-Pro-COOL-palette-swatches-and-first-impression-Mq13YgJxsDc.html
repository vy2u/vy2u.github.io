here before I went live I didn't know
that was even possible I thought that it
was like whenever I hit the button that
was when it would go but that's really
cool so good to see you guys so I
promised you that we would do before I
left for Iceland we're leaving tomorrow
I just watched this for you and we would
do I figure we'll do like a little eye
look while we're here so this may be a
long video since you know we got a lot
of shades of swatch you know got lots of
shades and we've got and I look we're
gonna play with so hello everybody this
is a live stream so if you're not a fan
of the live stream format I'm very sorry
I know it's gonna be long and I'm sorry
but this is all I could do to get this
up to you now before I leave because I
won't be back for a week so I wanted to
get the two now I had to get the cool
one because for me I'm a little bit
tired of the warm stuff I've gotten
plenty of warm stuff I'm kind of warmed
out so I know that a lot people really
like warm but I'm kind of done with it I
like warm too but you know I was ready
for some coal so they give you the
little sheet here which I don't like I
wish that they had printed the themes on
the palette that would have been very
very nice hello fellow male at
Marylander that's so cool riley says
first time in livestream yay and happy
birthday to Melissa Tati said she was
over a warm over warm in her video today
ok I didn't see that video but I'll
probably watch it later so anyway let's
go ahead and get into swatching this
thing no more no more chitchat over you
know whatever let's get into this so I'm
gonna put this hey it's Alanna from
makeup girl rocks what's up girlfriend
okay so one thing I do like about this
already is that this does seem to stay
up but it's not like I wish it was just
a little bit tighter that would be good
but it's kind of falling down it's very
very very heavy Megan says she's easy to
my channel and she loves it thank you so
much I'm so glad um yeah it's very heavy
when I picked this up I got this and
what was the other pallet I got recently
I got this and another thing in the mail
and I was like oh my goodness this one
is heavies
oh yeah just so you know it's got some
serious weight to it I'm so glad you're
here Carrie okay so we're gonna start
with linen we're gonna do finger
swatches powder seashell and tõll tõll
feels very gritty look at this grit I
don't know can you guys see that the
grit it's like straight grit let me try
that again
wow that does not feel good okay the
rest feel very buttery they've got a
buttery creaminess okay let's do hmm how
are we gonna do this let's do it here
last time I did this with the Jaclyn
hill palette the lighting was so bad I
was like I need a totally different
setup okay that is definitely a like
over shadow or something glitter mmm
these look very nice though those look
good they look creamy they look nice I'm
curious to see how they're gonna perform
on the eyes but those look nice this one
is not there's not a lot happening there
it's like straight powder glitter that's
I'm not a fan of that one that one is
called Tull I think yes tol okay and
they just wiped right off by the way
super easi just watched a tease video
Elizabeth said oh you know I haven't
even really been on YouTube today I
didn't realize that she just did one
that's cool what makeup are you taking
to Iceland I haven't decided yet I
haven't tacked it yet but something very
simple cuz I only have room like we're
bringing one suitcase for all of us
because we have to pay like $100 or some
crazy for each bag because we're doing
that Wow air so okay well swatch while
we talk
lot a flax violet grey and ballet mmm
ballets they're definitely kicking up
powder if you see that not as bad as
lorac but there's definitely some kick
back up here but I haven't watched
Tottie's video yet so I don't know what
she said I've been out running errands
my son is having his birthday party the
day after we get back so those watched
very nicely hello in London this watched
very very nicely
I like those this one's a little patchy
this purple one this one's called violet
grey let's swatch that one again it
definitely builds so that's
isn't that beautiful okay all right
lat remember no primer on my arm so
lasting is really good it's it's
definitely staying on the arm so that's
good so far the first few did not stay
on my arm but that's typical for lighter
shades Marty says have you birth through
my son thank you so much Melissa says
cool tones are so refreshing to see I
know I'm with you okay we're gonna do
cashmere tea rose pink champagne and
rose pink champagne reminds me of the
other one the one toll that was really
chunky weird glitter but there's a
duochrome to it it's a pink and orange
duochrome which is pretty alright I'm
just gonna put him down here oh that's
really pretty never mind can you see
that oh no it says very bad connection
can you guys see me I'm hoping that it's
okay it says very bad connection oh
that's not good okay hopefully you guys
can see okay but yeah these are very
nice okay everything's fine my phone is
saying it's not good so I'm hoping it
doesn't cut out on me if it does and
then I'll just have to come back okay so
these look really nice this one I was
surprised can you see that shift there
it's like a it's the base of it is like
almost like a mustard yellow and then
it's got these pink sparkles in it you
see the Pink's there we go that's a nice
representation of it this one's really
cool too this one is called rose this
one's pink champagne and this one's rose
cool so pink champagne and rose very
nice I'm glad that it's a lovely
connection it says very bad connection
so hmm okay but yeah let's wipe those
off and see what happens
and those are gone so those are gonna
need a primer it was ones right there
those are completely gone all right
let's keep going get rid of some of that
powder okay let's go into orchid mist I
should show you what i'm swatching here
orchid mist
oh I don't know how to say that word cro
qu is cokie is what i want to say but i
don't know if that's right or not ash
and mushroom those feel really nice this
one feels like a true foil right here
buffering a little Oh hoping it hangs in
there I'm gonna put a little bit more on
this finger the price is expensive but
I'm hoping that it's worth it
so we'll see okay see that's a true foil
right there look at that this one
reminds me of coloured raine very much
it feels a lot like it it's very loose
what can you buy for the same price I
don't know of anything exactly like this
that you can buy for the same price it
looks very similar to like Natasha Genoa
where's my Natasha - no in a palette
Bourdon see if I can find it really
quickly here it is so you guys can see
because these are being compared to
Natasha - Nonna so the burgundy shade is
beautiful and it's watched beautifully
this one swatched really nicely -
actually all these released watched
beautifully this is the Natasha - no no
this is the blue-green and then this is
the Sephora so you can see there's
definitely similarities as far as the
design of it the number of shadows all
of that very very similar why be used to
a swatch very thin new a BH palette when
you get back the new AVH palette I don't
own that it hasn't come out yet
but when it does I'm definitely
considering getting it actually I'm
gonna swatch this shade from Natasha de
Nonna
this one right here this is definitely
softer than the one in the Sephora but
I'm gonna swatch it right here
next to it so there is Natasha de Nonna
and then there is the Sephora Pro
they're definitely different this one's
more foiled this one's got more glitter
in it they looked similar though
I like them too taught you to know no
better there though but it feels a lot
like coloured raine like I was saying
earlier okay let me go ahead and try to
wipe these off because I really like
this set of four it's beautiful and
lasting power is pretty good look at
that red very nice
$85 Canadian that sounds about right
so our 401 looks kind of chunky it does
but I would imagine it would blend out
on the eyes just fine we'll find out I
might I might use that one we'll have to
say I haven't decided yet
subculture comes out July 25th
I believe Christina says I love your
calm voice in this video this is the
problem while I swatch the next one
everybody talks about how I yell at the
camera this is why it's it's ingrained
in me that I need to project my voice
when I was in high school I did a lot of
theater and the cameras way over there
so I always feel like I need to project
my voice and I'm constantly trying to
like fix myself and make sure I don't do
that we're gonna do fog graphite heather
gray and mauve I'm always projecting my
voice so it's not that I'm yelling
anybody it's just I'm projecting and
teachers project exactly Allie like when
I was in the classroom I was always
projecting my voice so it's you know it
comes off as yelling to some people and
I'm sorry but I'm working on it I'm
working on it yet many mattes yes let me
swatch these and then we'll count the
mattes together so let's do these are
swatching very nice oh look at that one
that one swatched really nice Alexandra
I think you're just used to my voice you
said my voice sounds a normal this one
looks a little bit patchy but I have a
feeling that one's gonna be beautiful
look at that
that's really pretty these remind me a
lot the way they're swatching of lorac
shadows but not as much powder kick-up
how many colors are in the palette 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 times 4 is 28 I had to think for
a second but yeah those watched
beautifully absolutely beautifully Oh
Lee says that you see I remembered your
name is timely that you talk too loud to
you
all the time I'm gonna try to wipe those
off and look at that no primer no primer
looking good looking good
okay so let's count the mats real quick
let's count the mats one that's more of
a satin two three four five six seven
eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen mats
is what I'm counting from eyeballing it
that's a lot of mats which is nice I
like that for a colorful palette to have
so many mattes
I have not dipped my brush in yet but
we're gonna do that in a bit let me get
my remover here get rid of some of these
swatches so we can start over
okay block sorry I had to block a
creeper how did they even find it I
don't understand hi Sabrina the makeup
mom I missed what I miss what you said
though I got him oh my god him nurse
voice there you go yeah it is kinda like
a nurse voice my loud voice okay where
did we stop did we do orchid I don't
remember I don't think we did work it
yet this one doesn't look like it has a
fingerprint in it yet so let's do work
in any other questions feel free to ask
while we're doing it this one feels more
like that over like that overcoat kind
of thing a new chocolate bar palette I
know nothing about a new chocolate bar
palette I know they're coming out with
strawberry stuff and this one's rosewood
and then this one's coffee so we've got
a matte in orchid and then we've got
this glittery kind of craziness from
moon and then rosewood has like glitter
in it ish
but it's not as chunky as this one and
like it's like a satin with some glitter
in it and then this one's a matte beauty
news posted a white chocolate bar
palette coming this Holly oh yeah that's
right they did mention that they
mentioned that a long time ago that they
were gonna do a full-size white
chocolate bar palette but I don't know
if we have pictures of it yet do they
have pictures
ooh that's interesting okay so this one
you can see that that one's more like a
topper
so yeah this one's beautiful this one is
like you know how we were talking about
when we did the Kat Von D shade + light
glimmered palette when we did the
swatches of that one how it had like
ones that were like toppers that's
what's going on with this one and also
with tole
they're very sheer with like glitter
this one's really neat I want you to be
able to see the sparkle in that it is
like a burnt orange with blue glitter in
it that is weird
I am never even I never would have even
thought of that and then this one's a
beautiful matte brown that's very
interesting there's definitely like let
me wipe these off there's definitely
some uniqueness in this palette I will
definitely give it that alright so two
of them hung around with no primers so
that's good busy art or Sephora Pro C I
don't honestly I don't have that much
busy art to really even give a good busy
art like I don't I really don't feel
like a Visio art expert I'm sorry I wish
I will I do a full review of this
palette possibly I haven't I don't know
it kind of depends on what comes at me
when I get back it's kind of I don't
like to commit to anything yeah it's got
blue glitter in it it's like a like a
light blue glitter in this right here
can you see that shift so weird okay we
got four left we've got hot chocolate
espresso sketch and obsidian of sketches
very buttery this one down here this
gray it's very buttery did you just get
the Sephora Pro cool are you getting the
other warmer colorful one no I'm not
getting the other ones there's a
sponsor's enough oh my goodness wow look
at that black that was what I was hoping
that Jacqueline Hill black was gonna be
like that was what I wanted it to be
this black is awesome but the wow what's
going on here look at that a metallic
gray oh my gosh
oh my gosh the metallic gray kind of
wiped away but man that black is that's
a black that's what it's supposed to be
oh thank you it says um it was a trick
rarey
says she appreciates how thorough I am
thank you so much yeah Wow okay so
alright let's go ahead and do a little I
look together for 15 minutes in reminds
me of Tarte black yeah I even I think
it's even better than the Tarte black um
actually before we do that lets do a
little comparison of the Natasha to Nona
now remember these Natasha did ánotá
pal so like 200 some dollars I was kind
enough that somebody was kind enough to
gift this to me my friend Nancy gifted
this to me because she got it in her
beauty lish lucky bag and she already
owned it so she gifted it to me so let's
see if there's anything I can kind of
dupe this with okay let's do the gold so
this one is let's do the goal from
Natasha to Nona and let's do the gold
from the Sephora oh this is the one with
the shift though it's not the same
because it's got that shift that's not
the same that's not even close I sign
them close because it's not the same
formula I never mind that's not gonna
work okay is there anything else in here
that's similar because I would really
like for you guys to be able to see a
comparison um let's see maybe this Brown
here hmm well we can we can compare
formulas because this is more warm
overall oh right here maybe okay let's
try this one and let's try this one they
feel very similar so this one here is
Natasha - no no this one here is the
Sephora so let's put these down here
okay so Natasha Danone is on top
Sephora's on the bottom Sephora starts
off a little chunkier I don't know
that's a shimmer and a matte
I can't even compare those either ah I
really want to have ones that I can
compare but I can't find any that is
such a bummer oh well well it was a nice
thought but they feel the same like the
mattes feel the same which is really
cool okay let's go ahead and do a little
I look
I'm gonna put on my eye primer I haven't
put on any makeup on today at all well
we'll just do something super quick
we're not gonna go into all artsy fartsy
not like I ever do that anyway but let's
see how they perform on the ice because
I know that's really important okay so
let's go ahead and let's take into this
shade right here of course somebody said
thank you for doing a look absolutely
but we're gonna go ahead and dig into
this one first to see if it's deep
enough for a transition I don't know if
it will be but I'd rather start lighter
and then move it deeper so oh no too
late not gonna work okay we're gonna go
into the next one which is called flax
and that's going on very easily let's go
to the other way
that went on super easy okay now let's
go ahead and do um hmm what should we do
what should we play with hmm
decisions decisions this is where the
the whole choice comes in okay I'm gonna
use a little bit of one of these Matt
Browns this hot chocolate color this one
that where might know the one next to it
the dark one that's next to the one
where my thump is I can't really
readjust here and we're just gonna put a
little bit of that in the outer corner
I'm doing that whole thing that I did in
my in that tutorial quote tutorial video
that I did yeah the Pink's are beautiful
v hi V how are you V this is just a
clean brush that I'm using to blend it
the pigmentation is not really staying
it's kind of blending out which is good
in that it's blending it's not like too
stiff
well this eyes better I feel like the
other eye it kind of blend it away you
see the difference trying to get the
light on it see how this eye it's not
dark but then this eye it's dark you
know hi Katerina tried to really mute
all 3 palette she's on the fat she did a
beautiful look I'm sure she did
Totti is very makeup talented okay
all right well we're gonna hmm see it's
like super stiff on the one side but
then it's blending out on the other side
weird okay maybe just different amounts
of products on either side okay
so let's leave that alone for now and
let's go all over the lid
let's do I'm gonna start with a matte on
the lid and then we'll go to a shimmer I
want this purple all over my face
I just want to paint my face in this
purple I'm not gonna put all over my
face though okay not purple I love you
can you see that I hope so
maybe the top layer of shadow was stiff
maybe well I don't know because it's not
it's not it's very very soft it doesn't
seem like you know some some things you
kind of have to get through a film
before you get to like the good product
I'm not feeling that with this palette
I'm feeling like it's doing pretty
stinking good okay now what I'm gonna do
is I want to layer over top this shade
right here and see if we can get like a
nice little shine on it right in the
center that's true Tina I don't have to
makeup talented in order to give you
consistency that looks pretty this is
the shade Rose
I like that you see it look I'm like
hunching over like let's see if I can
tilt this up just a little bit boom
okay that way oh thank you mark tikka
she likes my nail polish okay can you
see the shimmer there this shine versus
that side okay I just want to use as
many shades as possible
hmm I learned nicely it's nice hmm thank
you I feel like it looks like real life
too um Lee said it that my is nothing
wrong with way I do my eyeshadow cuz
it's like real life Thanks
I think that's pretty true yes Rose is a
shimmer not super opaque though okay
let's go ahead and we're gonna dig into
one of these pinky shades over here I
think I'm gonna do like mmm cuz I want
something to match this color hmm
let's do a little bit of this one can
you guys see someone here I'm gonna put
that up on my brow bone a bit uh it is
nice it's definitely nice it's working
well I mean I think everybody's got
their limit of what when something's too
expensive when they're like oh no then
you get that feeling in your gut like
ooh that's too expensive and I think
that no matter what sixty-eight dollars
is gonna be over the threshold for some
people and I totally get that and I
don't think it has anything to do a lot
of times with how much money you
actually have but with your inner gut
feeling I mean I think that just
sometimes you know like I was saying
before like I would never pay you know
thirty dollars for a bowl of ice cream
because why would I do that you know
like certain things just have a
threshold in your mind of like what you
feel things are worth and for some
people $68 for eyeshadow is not worth it
no matter what I mean you could jump on
be on your face like dancing you know
like and it still won't be worth $68 so
I mean for me is it worth $60 so far
yeah I like it I like it a lot I love my
Natasha to Nona palette but I don't
still don't think I would have paid 200
some dollars for it um testing it damp I
would rather not because that's getting
into a whole nother 35 swatches but I
might be able to do a little bit we'll
see maybe let's let's finish this look
and then we'll talk about the dance
my microphones being weird okay there we
go it's over the threshold for you but
you love him seeing how it performs yeah
I mean it's fun it's definitely fun okay
let's go into let's do this shades
seashell I'm gonna put this in the outer
corner this one right here it's like a
shimmery and I'm just gonna pop that
with my fingertip real quick right there
boom boom boom I've been really diggin
on using my fingertips for eye looks oh
look at that Grayson ooh yuck I need to
blend that out Marty is talking about
like she's like you know it's kind of
weird going to the dentist with like
full out Instagram look it's true I mean
I think there's a time and a place for a
full out Instagram glam but I don't
think it's necessary all the time
sometimes you just need something light
you know what I mean okay let me put a
little bit on my brow boom we're gonna
use that first shade linen which is that
like matte cream shade and I'm just
gonna blend out right here just to kind
of soften that up a little bit and then
we'll put on a little bit of liner just
so we can see it finished but I think
this is as much as I'm gonna play on my
eyes today as far as application on my
eyes I'm really enjoying it I love the
way this is blending out right here and
I'm really enjoying how it looks oh
let's play with lower lashline I don't
care if it matches I just want to play
with different colors and we can do a
little we can do a few of them wet yeah
we can we'll do a few of them wet
because I know that a lot of people want
to dentist glam that's a new one I know
right um let's see I really really I
know this isn't gonna match or at least
I don't think it's gonna match I really
want to use this one right here this
weird like it's looking pink to you but
for me it looks yellow that's so weird
it totally looks yellow to me right now
but on camera it looks pink that is so
odd
okay well we're gonna just gonna go
we're gonna do it
weird doesn't look yellow or pink well I
guess it looks pink I don't see any
yellow in it that is the weirdest shade
I've ever seen in my life
not in a bad way necessarily but it
wasn't what I was expecting okay
what are we oh em gee and lmao thinking
about I missed something I totally
missed something but yeah the lick look
at the swatch can you see the swatch of
it let me see I can get it to shift
orange a little bit but in the pan it
out where it looks gold it's very odd I
definitely missed something my name is
Vicki bass to help the color the color
shift possibly let's definitely do that
one way and see and I would imagine all
over the lid it's gonna give a different
look heck let's put it all over our lid
right now let's do it
you know we're gonna do because we want
to play with these shadows we want to
know what happens hold on I have makeup
forever setting spray right here and
we're gonna take a brush and we're just
gonna try to pop that all over the lid
and see what happens because I want to
know can you show me oh I did that
backwards darn I always do it backwards
wipe it off wipe it off or it off the
best palette packaging um you mean
pretty wise or functional wise okay let
me do that again put product on brush
then spray brush not the other way
around Jen so four points expiring no I
haven't heard of that mm-hmm I'm just
gonna dip it in the edge of the product
oh there we go there we go that's what
I'm talking about can you see the shift
so I can get the light on it you see the
shift hopefully oh if you're Sephora's
points expire if your account has been
an inactive for 18 months V says that is
really cool
uh-oh hope everything's okay see some
people kind of arguing a little bit
let's all can't we all just get along
it's got a really nice little shift to
it though who goes inactive for 18
months I'm sure some people - oh wow
okay all right I'm gonna put a little
more fix+ on this it's I'm really having
trouble getting the product up on my
brush and I'll show you the way that the
shadow looks I'm not happy with how it's
working you have a favorite brand of
brushes my favorite is it cosmetic the
Eco to brush tool brushes my favorite
brands of brush are I do like it
cosmetics a lot but I love my motor
brushes and I love my beauty junkies
brushes and I love my Real Techniques
brushes that is so pretty you see this
show you can really see it I think
toothpaste 50 shades of white palette oh
that is funny yeah I'm not really
impressed with the Holiday Collection
with toothpaste but look look what
happened to the shadow do you see the
sea down there but that might have been
my fault because of that might have been
my fault
I started had to block somebody that
might have been my fault because my
brush may have still been wet when I
dipped it in so I'm hoping I didn't just
ruin my shadow I may have to do a little
scraping to rescue that okay who take a
scotch tape yeah I think I just did that
to it I'll fix it though it'll be all
right hmm
okay so I think that the look is pretty
much done maybe we'll do a little bit of
black in the corner just because I want
to try the black just a tad bit cuz I
want to see what it does and then we'll
do some liner so we can see a more
finished look and then we'll do a few
swatches wet and then we'll be done X
bar courage seems to know about the
glitter thing X spark knows about
everything makeup X bar cute spark ages
might like makeup hero one of them
anyway as far as like tutorials go woman
knows everything she has no idea who I
am but I love her okay so that's gonna
be it I think no you know what I keep
saying
it's gonna be it and then I decide to do
something else
does that happen to you too let's do
that little bit of that chocolate brown
on the lower lash line just a little bit
down here just to kind of deepen up the
bottom a little bit okay there we go I
feel better now
okay I am leaving for my trip tomorrow
we are leaving tomorrow flight takes off
about five I believe something like that
five ish mu get my liner okay I have to
tell you about this if you don't know
about this oh my goodness next epic and
Kleinert oh my goodness uh stinking
amazing if you like felt-tip liners and
you like like the cat finds you have the
Stila one and you run out and you need
another one right here this is what you
need um Liz yes I do like motor brushes
very much I don't know if you guys can
hear my kids playing I can hear them but
they're getting along as long as they're
not arguing very Lynette says she's very
happy with her Sephora cool and warm
palettes Oh crazy beauty who each likes
this one yeah definitely me too it is
super fab so per easy to use hard candy
stroke of gorgeous liner I was like
Stila - oh really I've never heard of
that one I don't got a Walmart much I'm
not a walmart fan there's something
about Walmart that gives me the Ickes
but like when I was a kid my mom used to
drag me to yards Hills and I hated them
like so any store that like looks
disorganized in any way bothers me and
for some reason Walmart seems
disorganized to me look at that fail
that was an epic liner fail right there
it's like shunka dunk I was not thinking
about what I was doing
do I need to fix this Oh Tara says she's
jealous of my Iceland vacation thank you
I'm excited to see if I can no that
didn't work
hold on hang tight gotta fix it yeah I
don't know where am I
I get what I could get quickly Oh Thank
You Teresa
i I just you know a lot of the stuff
that I do I don't watch a lot of
tutorials obviously so a lot of the
stuff that I do is because um because I
just figure out what works for me
instead of like being smart like a lot
of people and watching tutorials I just
gotta figure things out on my own but
okay there we go all right we got to
redo that wing cuz that was just not
cute
Andy and I should do a collab I agree if
you wish to do a club when I get back if
you want to but you don't have to if you
don't want to do I do you took full-time
my liner is great yes I do too YouTube
full-time but I don't I don't like we
don't rely on my YouTube in order to
survive but I do
yeah so let's do it okay so that's good
enough for liner let's put on a little
mascara let's do a little lash princess
if you've never tried essence mascaras
the lash princess mascaras are amazing
they just came out with new ones and I
want to try them so bad love essence
lash princess
once you try essence lash princess you
will never buy a high-end mascara ever
again they're so good these and what's
the other one that I love Jordana best
lash extreme oh my gosh amazing off
eraser pen is amazing I have one of
those somewhere I was trying to see what
I could grab quickly I think I have a
julep one that I like I love how these
shadows blended into each other I don't
know if you can see it on camera as well
as I can see it but like I'm putting on
my mascara and looking at the way the
shadow is blended into each other and
for someone that has
average amount of makeup skill I feel
like it blended really really well into
each other I really like it a lot what
made us decide to go to Iceland well we
were supposed to go to Brazil and that
didn't work out because the plane
tickets were outrageous and Iceland
plane tickets were super super cheap and
last year we went to on a big huge road
trip there's vlogs on my channel we did
this big giant road trip and we went to
the Grand Canyon and we looked at all of
these sites to see and Iceland going to
see the icebergs and hot springs and all
that stuff and we just decided that we
thought it would be a place that we
would love to travel to mostly because
of like the outer the outside things
should do I have heard Cheryl that
there's lots of crime in Brazil that was
another thing is we were gonna have to
spend the kids and I were gonna have to
spend a lot of time in Sao Paulo in the
hotel because it wasn't safe for us to
go out by ourselves so I wasn't really
looking forward to doing that so you
know Iceland just seemed more logical
okay so let's do a few of these wet and
dry we'll skip and Matt so we'll just go
straight to the shimmers let's do this
guy down let's do both of these let's do
these two right here and we'll do wet
and we'll do dry so there we go
put these two here so these are both dry
actually I probably should've done with
a brush huh well let's do a brush swatch
wet especially of that second of that
first one it's very Champa dunk it's
very like one if you can see that the
glitter is very chunky there isn't a lot
of base to it it's just like strength
litter yeah that did not go so well that
did not go well at all
it's just chunking up maybe if it was
packed on I don't want to get hard pan
on this one too because it's the same
kind of formula I mean I guess you could
probably yeah it's like a glitter topper
I don't think that that one is meant to
be wet at all let's try the red one next
to it this one is called
looked over my thing rosewood okay I'll
put a little bit oh yeah you know what
I've been thinking about doing a vlog
and then just like one vlog because last
year we did vlogs for like every single
day there is it wet oh I love that look
at that that's dry that's wet very nice
thank you for the be careful with my
foot that's a whole other long story but
I'm thinking about doing like one log
instead of like multiple vlogs and just
kind of put the best parts into one
thing it seems to happen every couple of
weeks just wondering if Jim blocked you
Claude Ann I would never block you I
love you I love my Claude dad no way
would I ever block you oh my gosh
alright let's do these two these little
guys over here
hey I've been a while since I've been me
oh hi Jodie how are you I am gonna be
doing snapchatting yes make sure
following me on snapchat
okay rose and orchid mist will do both
of those wet and dry and if you guys
have no other requests then I'll wrap
this up okay so these are dry okay my
snapchats just Jen loves reviews cannot
figure out snapchat girlfriend you know
what you do this is what you do if you
cannot figure out snapchat you Google or
you not Google but you do on YouTube
snapchat tips and tricks or snapchat how
to snapchat that's what I did because I
agree it's not intuitive it's not an
intuitive thing but I think that's like
their marketing think because it makes
the teenagers feel like they know
something that their parents don't know
alright this is wet this one is rose wet
but there are videos that you can that
they'll show you everything that there
is to know about snapchat I still don't
really like it as a platform overall
just because I feel like there's still
things that I don't really get but I
like it better than Instagram right now
there's that one wet so these two are
dry so this one's the dry of this and
this is the dry and this is the wet so
they definitely work wet
they definitely foil a little bit and
you can see any kind of shift in them a
little bit better when they're wet Oh
Christy says do I like bareMinerals eye
shadows yes I like the loose ones I like
the pressed ones I like them I haven't
tried every single bareMinerals palette
so I don't know if they've changed
anything since I've gotten one but yes
definitely okay so any other requests
for this palette before I wrap this up
we're at 40 minutes so what do you guys
think any anything else you want me to
do with this before we go we'll give you
a couple of seconds
I named my palette Dave I know I didn't
make my palette Dave maybe I should be
naming my palette though that's very
inspiring granite okay granite icy
graphite is that the one you mean
graphite that's a matte no not me that's
so funny oh okay
what's up with Instagram it's the only
one I figured out I just don't like
Instagram I feel like I need to be too
perfect there's too much pressure I get
they get Oh making sure I didn't miss
anything do they have a smell if I put
my nose right up to it they smell like
makeup oh thank you for the well-wishes
on my vacation I appreciate it they
don't smell I can look at ingredients
Brooke buck look into a glance at
ingredients let's see
looks like talc mica Kalin at the hexyl
palmitate so if you're anti palm oil no
good but their typical carmine for your
vegans carmine ultimate ring ins means
not lip safe
other than that I mean they're very
typical ingredients not all of them have
carmine though it looks like moon tall
and pink champagne do not have carmine
everything else does or mayor it says
may or may not contain but yeah nothing
crazy in here safflower seed oil coconut
oil that's in a few of them so looks
like there's three different formulas
shea butter oh my goodness that must be
like the super creamy ones ferric
ferrocyanide so not lipped safe so
that's kind of the breakdown on the
ingredients for that would you recommend
this pout for someone just diving into
cool tones remember this is my first
impression this is the first time I
played with this um so far yeah I would
it's fun it's different I feel like
there are a lot of shades in here that
are different than anything else I own
so I really like that about it that
they're definitely different than the
Shea other shades that I own there's a
lot of matte in here though
so if you don't like a lot of matte if
you like a lot more shimmer there's
there's some yeah definitely Jen
approved so far from the one look that I
did they blend really beautifully into
each other but I feel like it's it
doesn't have a lot of standard typical
shimmer shades that you get in a lot of
other palettes so I personally
appreciate that but if you want
something that's more typical then I
would say for shimmer wise you may want
to get something else but the fact that
has all of these beautiful maps in it I
love that I love that there's so many
mattes and I love it there's a mix of
browns and grays they didn't just stick
to the Bratz of the Grays cuz a lot of
cool tone palettes they'll just go gray
you know what I mean
sketch you want me to swatch sketch
sketches this one this is this gray down
here it's very soft it's very soft it's
beautiful it's really nice so yeah so I
I really I'm very much enjoying it the
last thing I ever seemed like it was
gonna be good even without a primer as
far as like wiping it off of my arm just
that's just kind of my little mini way
of getting an idea
it's not completely scientific is it
cruelty-free Sephora I'm not sure if
Sephora's cruelty-free to be completely
honest I don't know I'd have to look up
and see if Sephora brand is cruelty-free
let me see where it's made to the same
where it's made it says distributed from
California made in the USA so yeah I
don't know what I'd have to look that up
but they sell in China so no yeah you're
right you know what can they do have a
China Sephora so no it would not
well it depends though because some
people just because they sell they sell
in China someone no because that would
you're right you're right that wouldn't
be cruelty-free you're absolutely right
all right what's up okay I gotta get
going so well it's okay
we'll go I have to take my daughter to a
birthday party but you're right Sephora
is not cruelty-free you are 100% right
because they do sell in China all right
I'm gonna take her to a birthday party
no we gotta block somebody first block
bad person block okay and yes sabore is
not cruelty free all right love you guys
thank you so so much I was thinking
about manufactured in China not sold in
China sold in China is not cruelty-free
all right you guys have a wonderful
wonderful day thank you for joining me
for this live stream and I will see you
guys after I get back from Iceland
videos are coming up though while we're
gone no I'm yeah it's a first time on a
plane we have three video two videos at
least going up we have boxycharm and
then we have the ronny cosmetics liquid
lipsticks coming up on Friday so I will
