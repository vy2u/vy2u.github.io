microphone on all right hello my friends
hopefully you see a big difference in
the quality of my streaming because I am
using a webcam that is not my webcam on
my computer so I know I can see a big
difference hopefully you can see a big
difference I am very excited to not be
fuzzy and yellow I don't know why it
took me this long to do the webcam thing
so good morning to you all today I
thought we would just kind of take a
break from talking about products and
just talk about YouTube beauty in
general this was inspired by Angelica
Nyquist who I have been just loving her
videos lately she's just so raw and I'm
thinking let me actually you know what
somebody just commented on my video how
to spell her last name because I want to
make sure I get it right and why Q V is
T is how you spell her last name
Angelica a and GTL I see a and she puts
out really good videos if you like
colorful eye looks she's really really
good at those and she's just so raw and
you know unapologetically her you know
I'm and I just I love that so she did a
video about reasons why she would
unsubscribe to a YouTube channel and
this is kind of a spinoff of that and I
just want to talk about the beauty
community in general and things we love
things we don't love things we want to
stay and things that we wish would
change so starting that off is I'm going
to say hello to the people that are here
in the collective brain I did read a
notification when I signed on and people
watching this on the replay is art o
supposing the sound isn't synced II okay
let me do this let me try to restart the
sound yikes okay hmm I may have to
restart the stream that will be terrible
I mean let me try to mess with my sound
hold on hang tight
audio I've never had that problem before
I guess because of the mic let's let's
change them might be audio let's try
that and see if okay this is the mic
that goes with okay there we go it looks
like it's it might be sync now but this
is the mic that goes with the webcam so
it might be just my webcam not being
able to keep up with my mic or
vice-versa so is it better now don't
restart everybody finally got to a live
stream okay
hopefully you can hear me okay because
it isn't attached to me it's in front of
me so hopefully we're good now oh sorry
people on the replay I'll put a little
note it's people on the replay er like
this is terrible it's all out of sync I
can't even watch this it fixes okay so
anyway I want do you want to say hello
to the collective brain and then I do
want to do just a quick PR shout out to
a couple of brands that I know I'm not
gonna be able to talk about for a very
long time if at all and I just want to
give them a little bit of screen time as
a thank you for sending me some products
so we'll spend about three or four
minutes doing that and then we'll zip
through it and then we'll get into the
topic okay everybody's saying the sound
sounds good good well I guess my lav mic
is now going out the window
so let me just say a lot of the people
that are here because I like to add
people that are invited into my house I
like to say hello so kind of new here is
here buenos dias to you Theresa Oh
Theresa mo good to see you
good morning mantas here Brittany is
here hello good to see you and McGee
jeez here are we gonna spill some tea
this morning I don't know you know I
don't spill tea on purpose you know I
like to keep my tea in the mug but you
know sometimes I just gotta talk about
things you know so I don't I'm not
trying to like I don't want to spill tea
I just want to be a human being that has
an opinion is that okay you know I feel
like sometimes it's hard because you
know once you get to a certain number of
followers for some reason she's not
allowed to have an opinion anymore and
you know
I'm not trying to spill tea I'm just
trying to have a talk I'm having a
discussion and I'm a person with
opinions and I were right to have them
you know what I mean
all right so I don't know what's gonna
happen Gigi we're gonna have to see and
find out possibly but not on purpose
Shelby is here good morning Abby and
Tish and Felicia it's here hello my
friend Felicia and Rene Oh Rene I'm so
happy to see you and Emily and iris and
Aspen good to see you and Julie hi Julie
and Dollface and Misty and Katie and
Shauna and Consuelo and Melanie thank
you so much for being here and thank you
to everyone that I did not have a chance
to say hello to you hello to you and
Jody from yodelin Jodha actually she
says let's talk Tandy vitamins I am
going to do an entire video yeah I'm
gonna do a video I already started the
research on the vitamins I'm going to be
talking to doctors I'm gonna be you know
doctors that I know so there's gonna be
you know lots of info in that we're
going to go over each ingredient and
what it does and all of that but not
today because I don't have all my
research together so yeah so anyway I do
want to do this quick little PR thing a
brand called an as n AZ e li e nas
nasally nasally I hope I'm saying that
right nasally they sent me a box of some
skin care stuff I've got a headband
which y'all know when I do my skincare
I'm always bad at pulling my hair back
so I'm happy to have that they also sent
a peeling mask these are things I'm just
pulling out of the box these are some
things they have on their website they
have a youth illuminators illuminator
spot erasing and tone correcting
treatments and then they have an
anti-wrinkle eye cream and a cleansing
milk so they've they sent me these
things and I know that I am drowning in
skincare right now so I won't be able to
try these for quite a while but they are
on my list of things to try eventually
just not right now so I did want to show
it to you just as a thank you to the
brand for sending it to me give them a
little bit of screen time so thank you
so much for saying this to me
unfortunately I just can't try it right
now because I'm like
and skincare hey the other thing I
wanted to mention is the lip products
that I was wearing in today's what's up
in makeup it's the color lit is the name
of the brand on my lips I have a
combination of goals and boss-lady these
are lipsticks that dry down they are a
little bit drying though I have to tell
you as I was wearing them they didn't
crackle which I really liked
and the wear down was very very nice but
they are a little dehydrating and they
kind of suck the life suck the life out
of my lips a little bit but if that
doesn't bother you as much if you want
to lay down the lip balm first you can
do that but they do dry down very nicely
the colors are beautiful they're very
opaque they have traditional doe foot
applicator 's and they're their
beautiful colors they're just a little
too drying for me so oh my gosh that
says it just sink back up again so weird
oh my gosh I don't know what's going on
well I mean when you change something
you never know what's gonna happen so
hopefully everything is good as far as
the the sinking of the audio and video
the last thing is that perfusion always
sends their packages in these little
wrappings and I just wanted to open
these with you real quick I do enjoy the
fusion makeup they have sent me so much
stuff at this point that a lot of it is
just gonna have to go and give away
because there's no way that I could
possibly try and use as much stuff as
they're sending me so look forward to
giveaway I'm not sure what I'm gonna do
the next giveaway I'll have to see I
have to look at my numbers and see if I
can find a reason oh my gosh joe says
the sound is screw again that doesn't
even make any sense
try to go go back out and come back in
and see if that helps
Nikki Murphy's here hi Nikki Murphy okay
so this is the highlight palette and I'm
not going to swatch it because I don't
know I'm not gonna swatch it because
this will probably end up and giveaway
but this is a highlight makeup case and
these things are very very inexpensive
compared to other big palettes like this
you can get these I've seen the stuff at
like oh my gosh everybody's somebody's
if they think I'm having bandwidth
issues it might be a streaming thing
because I don't want the replay to be
off let me see it does look like it's
off it might just be that the video
quality is just too high
let me see let's see if I click use
buffering let's try that I don't know
what that does but we'll try still looks
like it's out of sync okay I'm gonna
open this while I try to figure this out
also frustrating well I'd be watching
the Oscars no probably not
I'll watch the replay I don't have the
patience I'll find out the highlights
CPU properties hold on a minute
Omar say what I just happened I just
turned black cancel okay I don't know
what I just did but it looks like it's
back in sync is it better it should be
better
oh my gosh that's so annoying five
seconds off that's a lot okay hold on a
minute
let's wait because I think it's catching
up oh this is terrible
I tried live-streaming on Facebook with
this and it worked out great so I
apologize to those of you that are on
the replay oh there it goes again
look I fixed it oh no cancel cancel
sorry I'm trying to fix the audio
term I don't know if I don't know how to
turn the quality down on this because
it's n coding software and I'm still
like relatively new at using this one
sorry you guys on the replay
I don't usually have problems like this
okay so I'm just gonna keep going and
then hopefully my voice keeps up I'm
gonna keep my window up with my face so
that I can see okay I think I can keep
it up so that I can see whether whether
it's working five seconds off that's
crazy
it looks like it's in sync right now
though I have not tried turning it off
and turning it on again because then
that would kill the stream so alright
let's talk about this real quick because
I want to get into the topic so okay so
dawn says that her husband had the same
problems on YouTube yesterday so it
might not be my camera okay so this is a
blush palette by perfusion it's a sick
color palette again not going to touch
it because I don't know if I'm going to
be able to use this so I'm not gonna
I'll probably end up doing this stuff
for giveaway I did do a full perfusion
getting ready with me I it was a
livestream that I did okay and then the
last thing in here okay Shannon says
we're fine now Nicki says I got to go
shower and film but I have a great day
Jenn fine Nigam RV go shower and film do
your thing
oh no it's off again getting questions
again about Tottie's vitamins I am NOT
going to talk about those today just
because I want to do an entire thorough
video I feel like there is a lot of like
haphazardly thrown up videos that are
just people just googling something for
five minutes without talking to a doctor
without finding out good information I
mean it's just it's driving me a little
nuts so I want to make sure that when I
give you information that it's good
information so again it looks like we're
off in the audio and video I'm really
sorry I think I might have to go out and
come back but this is the mixed metals
eyes and lips set so it comes with a
palette this I actually might try cuz
I've never tried they're metallic
formula but it's got a palette here and
then it's got lips and then it's got a
lip liner here which this I think is
really really cute I might actually have
to try this I've never tried they're
metallic
formula so what I'm gonna do is says
says which program am i using it's
something called
Oh OBS and that's the live streaming
software and then I've got a logitech
video camera so I think what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna
log off of this and I'm gonna try to
restart the livestream and we'll just go
straight into the topic and so hang
tight you should see another
notification coming up of the live
stream I'm gonna try to bump down the
quality thing so give me about five
minutes and I'll be back okay I see if I
can fix this all right mad love I'll see
you in a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
