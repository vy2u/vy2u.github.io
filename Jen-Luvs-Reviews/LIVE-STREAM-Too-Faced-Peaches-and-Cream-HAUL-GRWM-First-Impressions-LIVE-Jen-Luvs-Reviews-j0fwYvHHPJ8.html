page stuff and I want to share with you
because I'm super excited and I just
realized I forgot to check the people
who donated for this for super chat uh
well when I do the full review I'll have
everybody's names listed that donate for
super checked if that is how it was able
to buy so many things from this
collection I would have bought some of
it but I wouldn't have bought as much as
I did without super check money so I
wanted to thank the people that bought
it and now I just realized two seconds
ago
and I forgot to check so thank you to
those of you who have donated to the
super chat in the past
I appreciate you my hair's crazy we're
gonna believe this stuff right now so
let me show you first what I've got I
got the comfort mat foundation infused
with peach and sweet fig cream and
natural beige I got the peach perfect
mattifying loose setting powder infuse
the peach and suit fig cream this is
pretty this is pretty
I've got the highlighter this is called
peach frost let me show you it doesn't
smell like the sweet peach collection
they're regular original one it smells
more like true peach than peach candy
like the the other sweet peach
collection smelled a lot more like like
a peach rings I thought this is no no no
so see ya hold on let's verdict here
well this isn't the eyeshadow College to
plug up your eyeshadow palette to smell
it yeah it definitely smells slightly
different but it's not that far off okay
so I got the highlighter I got the Enya
brooms off which of course I had to get
I almost didn't get this and less that
one of the blushes instead but I've been
looking at this thing for like two years
okay we sneak this on what's a good
makeup like two years ago so I thought
it was going to come out with this
collection and it didn't so I had to get
it I had to go and then I got the
eyeshadow palette which looks like this
and I got two lipsticks I got one in
drunk-dial and one insects on the peach
so this is drunk-dial
and it's got these pretty little peaches
stamped in there
that's pretty it smells like vanilla it
doesn't smell like peach it smells more
like cream and then I got this Swan this
one is sex on the peach yeah it's got a
creamy scent it smells good it smells
really good and that's got a little TF
you see that little TF stands up there
that's cool that's very cool okay let me
go ahead and um oh I had a question
earlier on one of my videos I forget
which one that I read today but they
wanted to know what was happening with
katachi &amp;amp; 2face thing because Tasha is
suing Too Faced over this packaging and
I haven't heard anything but if we hear
anything it'll definitely be in tot news
for what's a good makeup if I hear
anything going on for lawsuit last thing
we heard to face was going ahead with
the launch
even though touch I had a problem with
it I guess Tasha couldn't stop them so
we have the packaging packaging is
similar in my opinion I don't know if
they're gonna win or not but packaging
similar so we're gonna start off not
your shadow insurance we're gonna start
off with the hangover primer and this is
a coconut base primer and it's a water
coconut water base primer I hope they
have enough in Newark I'm almost out of
it come on baby there we go because it
is a water-based foundation silica is
the second ingredient but the arm the
first ingredient is a first ingredient
is water so I think the hang there
primer would be good they did have a
primer that came with this collection oh
hold on a minute before I continue I
just want to say hello to the people
that are here because that's I like to
do that so I think it's nice to do that
so let me say hi I know Cheyenne was in
your purse let's see the top of this
here and Mayer sauce here says oMG I
can't believe I'm this early it's a
little things that make me excited oh
that's awesome
amy is here Nancy and Andrea and Lindsey
it's Lindsey's first live chat
Carolina's here and Julie and Katie and
rose and Hailey and
Lisa and amber and Pamela and Emily and
Willow Jamie and duck Bay hi from South
Africa hello to South Africa Jaz and my
highlight poppin hello and hello to
everyone else that they didn't say hello
to yet I'm going to scroll all the way
down to the bottom okay so now that
we've got our face primer on let's go
ahead and start with this peach perfect
foundation here it's got a pop top in
the squeezy - well that cannot print
easily mmm oh man I thought it was
supposed to smell good I was so excited
about that yes it smells a little bit
it's a bummer I didn't check the shade
match to see if we were good my too dark
it's a little dark that's a bummer and
we're gonna go for it anyway worst case
I'll take it to support and exchange it
okay um well it looks like regular
foundation it's a kind of liquidy but
not super liquidy it's not very thick I
might have just done too much though now
looking at this there's a little excited
okay that's enough we're not gonna do
anyone anything to wipe the rest of this
off yes I do
even I can't even I thought it was a
Miss number one like peaches though I'm
totally bummed about that makes me upset
but some people don't like set on their
face so that would be good this is
definitely the wrong shade it's
definitely too dark but I thought this
was the shade that I had for the Born
This Way Foundation oh I just realized I
should have done my brows before - okay
so coverage is light to medium
um feels very lightweight definitely
just feel heavy in any way one thing I
wanted to mention is this is not going
to replace my full review this is just a
fun like first impression to kind of
give you an idea of how I feel about it
right away because gonna take a while
for me to do the floor of you because
you all know I like to spend time with
products so it's probably gonna be a
while before you see the full review for
me I'm not one that will rush to be the
first one to get a product review up
because I don't feel like I can give you
the best information that way so it's
gonna be a little while before I fully
review okay so let me get up close sound
issues oh no oh you love my reviews
thank you my highlight pop in I
appreciate that a lot
I don't think the pelvis there really
sends it either Tiffany dawn is here
with Lisa no it's not it's not as
sensitive this one was this one you
opened it and was like a loft of scent
it definitely has a different scent it's
a little more of a true peach rather
than the candy peach yeah it's
definitely not quite a scented maybe
people complained about that but I can't
smell it in the foundation at all that
was something else actually they've the
gorgeous Rose says I used to love Too
Faced but then their quality seems a
gone hell yes
and I agree with you but I can't stop
because the kind of thing is too cute
I'm one that falls I did that video
about how how branch tricked us into
buying thing packaging is my thing
and I can't stop with this alright so
let me walk and sing this is a simple
human mirror by the way I get asked that
every time we use this mirror I get it
at Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond with the 20% coupon
this little place I can definitely see
my freckles let me get a little close so
you can see I can definitely see my
freckles through it it's very
natural-looking where I feel like the
Born This Way is definitely cakier
looking it doesn't look as natural it's
more full coverage with this I feel like
is definitely more natural I don't see
it seeping into my wrinkles or anything
yet it's more BB cream like than the
than the regular one they make they're
born this way
really mad at and I left a comment on to
face video for this let's try to build
it we're doing just one pump to try to
build it
I left a mess a comment on their video
that they said it was a video like the
difference between the Born This Way and
the new foundation I'll sit oh yeah
great no they didn't tell you the
difference it does have a little bit of
a very very very mild set but it's not a
lot but they didn't tell you the
difference in the video only what's
wrong with you people
you would not have passed my fourth
grade reading class because you didn't
answer the question fully you would have
failed state testing this is so the
wrong shame we're just gonna keep going
you see if I can get a little more oh
it's building
it's definitely building but I like this
I like this work for like every day
where where I like to born this way for
I'm trying to go quit because I don't
want this video too terribly wrong I use
the new born this way for filming it's
definitely building up to a more medium
coverage I don't think they're gonna be
able to get this to full without getting
it cakey but you could definitely get a
light coverage from this think BB cream
BB cream face line okay it's very go
there's that now let's dip into the
peach perfect power okay there is
definitely doing this it's definitely do
er than the Born This Way definitely
wear the Born This Way is like a satin
finish this is a little bit duder okay
so we've got this thing you know it's
brand-new brand-new okay so it has this
little capital top which is kind of nice
for mess I'm gonna tap a little bit into
the cap here this is what I do with my
um my bare minerals I love the bare
minerals setting powder if you want to
know a frame of reference what I like
the bare minerals one is fabulous
whoo you know some of that just got in
my mouth my accident is that apparently
I used too much which is really pretty
and it's very sweet tasting it reminds
me of if you've ever gone to an adult
party where they sell adult things and
they have like the the powders that you
can put all over yourself for adult
business that's what this reminds me of
as far as it just got in my mouth and it
tastes very sweet this has a stronger
peach scent than the other products that
I've smelled so far this one smells
delicious it's known there is sugary and
sweet and it tastes good just saying how
much do you get in the powder let me
check let me put the excess in here I
really like the way that that looks I
think it looks fantastic of course we're
gonna do full review so this isn't you
know we're test or anything so I can't
recommend any of this right now today
but just give you an idea it's a point
it's 35 grams I don't know how that
compares to my other one you said it's
within sight let me get my Laura Mercier
it's another my life
okay the Laura Mercier is 29 grams and
this is 35 grams but it's if you look at
it it looks like this woman use would be
smaller but it's taller so there you go
I definitely really like that so far
from first impression I think it looks
fantastic what is going on with my head
right there you're they've got like a
patching this right here that's my fault
though I did that alright I'm just gonna
rock some brows superfast I just will
bring out the well you can do the wood I
grabbed Too Faced chocolate brownie I
rock on so I'm just gonna do it super
fast I don't want this video to be an
hour long if I could help it I gotta do
something else here perfect
I was a great question I'm glad you
asked about how that is in the quarter I
can't tell you any prices or at the
second so don't think there's prices on
my receipt unless I looked it up I am
not selling any to body powder no I
don't work no MLMs for me none of that
not liking that fragrance is a thirty
ingredient listed for the peach probably
probably I'm going to be surprised for
the talc cornstarch sodium saccharin
there you go there's the sugar right
there and then fragrance
mmm-hmm I don't like fragrance that was
definitely not gonna be for you but
personally I am sorry I'm really liking
this I'm not sensitive to fragrances and
I don't really have a big problem with
them personally okay let's get into the
eye shadow do a little too faced shadow
insurance sahabas here hello hello glad
you're back the entire collection is
matte I believe so but I feel like the
foundation was doing the foundation was
definitely doing you get some of this
office that was too much
okay Andrew says she likes my top thanks
the Andrea I appreciate it
yes they put sugar in it they sure did
well it's saccharin so I don't know it's
not like sugar sugar it's like processed
sugar a load of stuff and Sweden all
right let's go ahead into the Just
Peachy Maps I'm gonna start with the
foodies
yeah not sugar sapper and yeah it's it's
not the same compound but it's you know
it's similar
let's do peach tea here I can taste it
on my lips okay that's nice let me try
to get a little closer
that's pretty this is the shape peach
tea right there no Sakura it's not the
stuff that makes a hyper I know okay
well that one I sleep to face shadows
are definitely hit but mostly miss for
me lately I think it's because I try a
lot more shadows than when I first
started buying to face stuff and I'm
pickier now than I used to be saccharine
isn't that sweet and low I think it
might be maybe I don't know make up make
up some make up and he belongs
saccharine oh no GMOs and make up now
not supposed to eat it though hypo means
low I think he meant hyper yeah I don't
know okay these are the motor brushes
these are the motor prismatic they'll
move okay so we're gonna do I'm just
gonna use this brush we're just gonna
keep going so we're gonna use just
peachy all over the lid while using it
on the side here what is really nice
what's it my smack I can't say that I am
I was expecting that I was the prince
with me okay and then we'll do a little
bit of peach butter right here know why
they do that they're just very slightly
different this one's just slightly peach
you and that's a little more White's a
little more on yellow based a little bit
of peach butter over here
I want curious to see how these are
gonna last for lasting power because
they're applying really nicely I'm very
surprised okay and my choice of brushes
would probably be different if I wasn't
trying to go quickly but this brush
works pretty well for that color it's
not bad but look how pigmented that is
I'm so surprised I'm really surprised
these are motor brushes these are the
new mode of prismatic so you can get
them these were sent to me by Mota I
just want to make sure I tell you that
but I love these brushes there are you
can get regular motor brushes which are
the exact same brushes in these but they
have different handles at Walmart or you
can go to Mota
I think it's motor brushes that commas
where they sell them alright let's go
into the outer corner and let's do a
little bit out there let's do a little
bit of just light right here
there is a little bit of powder hiccup
but it's not bad at all
this is like a purpley pretty there's
something about just a beautiful simple
matte look you know I think we get so
into the glitter I know I'm guilty of it
doing like too much glitter all the time
because I love my glitter but since it's
nice to just do like a simple matte look
this is really pretty I am very
surprised I was not expecting these to
be this day but again lasting Towers
gonna make a big difference and I can't
tell you that right now
so I'm not I'm not selling it yet but
all right I'm gonna going to teach
meringue for my brow bone
Hanan that is so pigmented wat to do
little swatches real quick in a second
but I'm I'm pleasantly surprised you
know to face I feel life is less for
Instagram and more for life everyday
works all kinds of pigmentation like
it's not so coffee in your face kind of
thing but it's very nice light look you
know Nia says I think they do almost all
almost the same colored shadow because
the color is are more expensive I don't
know I don't know if that's why they do
all the same colors I think they're
trying to appeal to a if this is what
you're trying to say I think they're
trying to appeal to more people and the
more neutral they go the more people
will buy it I think that's why they do
what they do
saying he says royal and langnickel
often Nichol officer flat rate of five
dollars and fifty cents for shipping to
all orders in the US and territories
Thank You Sonia Judy said this palette
just doesn't seem unique enough for me
oh it's not it's definitely not super
unique I would definitely agree with you
on that
okay it's a collection limited edition I
don't know I don't think they've
specifically said Mimi says the red one
on the bottom does not swatch the best
but it is really good on eyes that's one
right there peach sangria but play with
it a little bit since you mention it
a little bit of peach
you know whoa holy moley let's wipe off
the excess but that was too much that is
pigmented Wow I was not expecting that I
keep saying I was not expecting it
because that's the way I feel in this
moment but that's no series like it's
not the way you're of me are you seeing
what I'm seeing
Justine doesn't think it's
limited-edition I don't think so either
I think that all makeup is limited
edition overall for the most part not
all but most
then if as soon as it stops selling and
they'll get rid of it kind of like how
the Urban Decay smoky palette they're
supposed to be permanent and now it's
not I'm just gonna pop a little bit in
the inner corner I'm just doing I was
just doing that like shape and you know
on my brow bone to blend out that huge
sangria thank you for that suggestion I
appreciate that with the peach sangria
that worked out well alright while we're
here let's just do some swatches real
quick and they won't take very long they
feel very soft that one's a little
harder this one's packed a little harder
the one we can see what I can do here
two-face is figuring it out but they
need to bump up their quality a little
bit you can't see the peach sangria
double peach meringue that first one you
can't see it very well because of my
skin tone my neighbor volunteered to let
me swatch on her arm some have to go
over there and say she'll let me do it
so I want to get you that doesn't swatch
very well the peach punch but again
swatches are not everything in this
world they're definitely a little patchy
er swatched than I expect it but that's
not necessarily a bad thing because that
mean they might think of probably
building right last row last row this is
more for like the demonstration of how
it looks on my skin rather than the
actual quality if they're pretty they're
definitely pretty I love the shade
selection the shade selection is really
nice yeah summer says I don't think
swatches indicate quality I don't think
something there I think they give a hint
to it like whether they'll be buildable
and you can tell the shadows we really
really bad a lot of times with a swatch
and then sometimes it really does ends
up like that but beauty CJ says
sometimes it's better on the eyes and
swatches and to me go freeze I agree but
it's nice to be able to see them all
together on skin though instead of in a
palette so think that you know I think
it's helpful but I agree with you it's
not the end-all be-all that's why we're
gonna do a full review eventually
alright let's move on let's do a little
bit of the sweetie pie bronzer I've
heard that this bones here is just an
overspray and it is mixing you can see
it's pretty much gone at this point
alright now I'm going to use this as a
blush cuz I didn't get one of the
blushes whoa okay we've got lots of
shimmer I was not expecting well I know
why I wasn't expecting that much shimmer
but I was expecting a little bit more of
the pink to come through maybe when I
use more
one of the pink will come through but
that is definitely more of a highlight
it's not very pigmented I was expecting
a little more let me dig a little deeper
they're expecting a little bit more
color payoff it's very subtle I don't
think that this is gonna show up on
deeper skin tone so that's a bummer man
that is a bummer well I mean it's fine
it's nice it's nice on my skin tone but
much deeper than me I don't think it's
gonna show up
look see now the overspray is completely
gone so maybe it won't be quite as
shimmery now that I thought the
overspray off I published I've gotten
the overspray off first let me swatch
this on my hand with the brush I'm
digging a lot into this and see if we
can get some so you can see it's not
there hey Jen can you swatch the red
shade please oh you mean the from here
I'm talking about peach sangria this one
right here swatch nicely for me swatch
really well okay giveaway winners if
you're curious about that you can go
ahead to the I'm gonna try really hard
to build this up you can go over to the
video and they're all listed in the top
of the comment section and also in the
video description so yeah that's me
what's flying like digging in for x
right there
Cassie's here hi my friend she says hi
Jen I literally just ordered a bunch in
this collection do a full face first
impressions on my channel too nice well
this one I'm not super impressed look at
that I mean I dug a dug oh these here
from be dreamcatcher the gang's all here
alright let's go into the to face the
highlighter this is the peach frost and
this is a cream oh oh it's terrible
oh let me swatch on my hands nice watch
you okay it's got a little bit of a
shine tiny bit okay well maybe we'll try
it with a brush and see how it goes but
with the cream I don't know if this is
gonna smells but I could smell it from
here this one has a little bit stronger
this set right okay all right well it's
getting better life is better now it's
not as bad as I thought it was gonna be
and then after this we'll try it with a
fingertip and see if that helps because
this brush is only met for clean
eyeliners but out like a stippling brush
for cream Kyler's cuz I feel like there
- oh look there goes my toothpaste it's
gone all right I'm gonna swipe it on
compact instead which is what a typical
do for cleaning products but I wanted to
show though um it's subtle it's subtle
but also the bronzer I have some of that
on my cheeks - okay
well it's okay I don't know if it's
worth the price though we're gonna have
to keep testing this to see but I'm a
first impression is not so good on this
one it so I mean it's okay you try to
get close she can sing
all right well there's that all right
let's try the lipstick and then then
we're done so we're gonna try the more
natural one we'll wipe it off and then
we'll try the deep one pump kiss says it
seems like those like fast possibly
possibly I know you know I always try to
give better
I try to give to base if anything good
that I do hey it's creamy
that's interesting it's cooler than I
thought it would be but I like it I like
the shade it's pretty it's very
hydrating it reminds me of the lip creme
formula I'm gonna have to compare the
lip creme formula with this one because
it feels a lot like the la cremes if you
like the look friends you'll probably
like the way that this feels of course
we have to do wear tests and all of that
money I don't like about this packaging
is it has to be lined up with the peach
or it doesn't flow so if you're in a
hurry you gotta find the peach and then
click the closed that's kind of annoying
alright let's wipe this off let's try
the last lipstick I'd try the peach blur
yeah I didn't get the peach blur or is
that was that the foundation no I got
the peach perfect and I've done the soup
the setting powder and I got the
foundation but I didn't get the peach
blur awesome Anthes here oh my gosh all
my friends are in now Samantha margins
ah ha ha all right let's try the last
lipstick this is drunk-dial
they do have funny names for their
product I feel like this pulls a little
more than lower cremes and it's not so
bad
a circle as a purple lipstick
well my application is off today oh my
god I was on my fault I found the next
fix ball all right it's pretty I like it
it's pretty me this would look beautiful
on you this would look really beautiful
on somewhere the deep skin tone - I like
that I feel like I can rule the world
with this lipstick I like that so it
does have a stronger scent I can smell
it right now so if you don't like a
stronger scent in your lipsticks you
don't want to get this it definitely has
a strong vanilla scent so definitely be
careful with that oh thank you cast your
scent looks gorgeous on me thank you
any of the lip shades is actually peachy
I think so you'll have to check out the
shade selection on the website but I'm
pretty sure there are some but yeah I
really like this this is really nice it
does seem to pull just a little bit more
than the then the la cremes but it's not
bad it definitely feels hydrating it's
got a little bit of a shine to it it's
not matte it definitely has shine to it
this would never is definitely not kiss
proof in any way let me do this and try
to wipe it off to see the kind of
simulate some kissing if there was
wearing this to the day I won't give you
as much info as possible and then we're
gonna pop off here oh look it's giving
you a nice little stain there that's
nice look at that it's a nice team a
nice thing no it is a vanilla scent it's
not a peach scent to me
all one word caps is making fun of the
way I say the word cool it's oh cool I
can force my stuff to stay cool but I
say cool but yeah that's a nice little
steam it's got going on there that's
cool
so so far from first impressions let me
give you some final thoughts this is
really nice if you like a BB cream light
to medium coverage I'm really liking
this so far again full review coming
this is just first impressions lipsticks
have a sense
so if you don't like sense you're not
gonna like them but the are very creamy
and hydrating this one left a nice gonna
stain the highlighter is gonna be a
little more subtle it is a cream formula
and it's just a little more subtle I'm
not super impressed with this so far the
sweetie pie bronzer if oh it barely
shows up on me it's I'm very very sad
about that it's not really showing up
the glitter of the the shine on there
wasn't overspray so just keep that in
mind it does have more of a satiny kind
of finish once you get the overspray all
the I shadow palette is way better than
I expected it to be I used one two three
four five six shades in here all of them
worked very well I was very happy with
all of them but again we don't know as
far as lasting power goes that's gonna
be a big towel and then I really like
these setting powder it does have a lot
of fragrance in it so just be aware of
that but I really like the effect of it
and it tastes delicious
if it gets in your mouth it tastes
delicious so that is my final thoughts
on this collection so from that final
thought that is my first thoughts that
is my first impression thoughts on this
collection let me just show you because
I'm Somerset the bronzer looks very like
that is as much pigmentation as I could
get out of the sweetie pie bronzer let
me do a finger swatch because I want to
give you a look at that right by my
thumb and as a full-strength finger
swatch right there but anyway yeah so
hopefully that was helpful for you and
again full review will be coming
eventually but it's not gonna be for a
while I'm letting you know right now
because I want to make sure that I fully
test these products for at least a week
if not longer to make sure that I give
you the best information possible I do
have a couple of products from the candy
Johnson collection coming I don't know
if there's no point in the candy Johnson
collection at this point because I don't
even know if you're gonna be able to get
it for very long so I might even just
take it right back to the store because
I didn't hear good things about the
banana powder that I bought and I really
don't need the eyeshadow palettes I
might just take it right back to altar
without opening it so that they can
resell it because if you guys can't get
it there's no point in you reviewing it
there
pointing me up spending my money on it
so thank you again so much for being
here
I really appreciate it and mad love to
you if you have any experience with this
collection definitely make sure you can
even leave that in the comments below to
help us in the collective brain of
makeup awesomeness so we can all learn
from you as well and I'd love to you and
I will see you in a video soon thanks
