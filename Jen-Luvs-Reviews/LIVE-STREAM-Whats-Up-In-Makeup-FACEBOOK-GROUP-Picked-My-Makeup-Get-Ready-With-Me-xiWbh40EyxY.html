up and makeup chat oh it's so good to be
here it is currently 5 o'clock on Sunday
February 25th we usually do live chat at
at 10 a.m. Eastern time but the last
Sunday of the month I try to do it at 5
p.m. so the people that can't make it at
10 a.m. will be able to make it and hang
out so I forgot to put my contact lenses
in so this is going to be a challenge
you made me see me doing this a million
times if I'm trying to read or doing
this currency but today it's gonna be a
really fun video because I had thanks to
my wonderful administrator Michelle over
on the what's up and make up Facebook
group she organized this whole thing
she's amazing she does all kinds of
challenges over there they do makeup
roulette and they do all these other
games and stuff over on the Facebook
group and it's so much fun so thank you
to Michelle for organizing this she put
up a poll I gave her some options of
some different products and I said this
was her idea and she said you know we'll
have the Facebook group choose what you
use for getting ready with me and if
people really like it
and we can make it maybe like a
bi-monthly thing something like that so
this is the first time we've done it so
my facebook group actually picked a five
products yep five products once you have
five products that we're gonna be using
today which i think is a lot of fun
because who better to pick makeup than
other makeup lovers I mean my husband
picks my makeup my kid picks my makeup
my Facebook group picked my makeup today
so I'm not getting ready for anything
special other than just spending more
time with my family where I'm cooking
dinner I'm making some chicken meatloaf
with mashed potatoes and some carrot
fries garlic carrot fries that's what
we're having tonight for dinner super
excited about it because it's a very
quite delicious recipe but um but yeah
that's all I'm doing night so it's not
like I'm getting ready for anything
crazy so we can just have fun and enjoy
and not have to worry about look at
insane so that's the best time to get
ready I feel
as far as like the freedom of it anyway
I'm gonna go ahead and say hello to the
collective brain of makeup awesomeness
also known as the people that are here
in live chat I'm going to go ahead and
scroll up and say hello so hello to Lisa

like I said a minute ago one of our
another one of Ohio Corinne is here I
got to go and order so I don't miss
anybody Monica loves beauty who's here
almost every single week if not every
single week she's with her daughter at
Target shopping oh don't run into
anything with that cart Monica Megan is
here who is a woman of all tasks she's a
reporter she's she's a admin on the
Facebook group all-around awesome person
and then Joe is here and Tabitha of
course is here if I did not say hello to
you
hello to you at
welcome to the wets of makeup live chat
I'm gonna go ahead and put my glasses on
again for a second take a sip of coffee
we had made these at one point and I
really liked the mugs that we made so
maybe we'll do that again at some point
but yeah so let me tell you a little bit
about what happened with the choosing
now I had sent Michelle the list of
items very late at night one night I
wasn't thinking and what the foundation
was actually chose was the number 7
airbrush away foundation but I had
mentioned that I don't want to highlight
products on the channel that don't have
a very good shade range I will just
basically just very quickly just tell
you that this does have a really nice
medium you can build it up to full
coverage it feels very smooth to go on
actually really like this foundation a
lot but unfortunately the shade range
stinks so we're gonna go with choice
number two which was the fenty
foundation because this is more
accessible to the majority of my
audience I want the majority of my
audience to benefit from my reviews so
therefore that's why I'm doing this it's
not for any political reasons or crazy
reasons or you know it's because I want
my audience to be able to appreciate and
be able to use my reviews I need to go
to Sephora and and to the drugstore and
up on some of my complexion products and
get more that do have better shade
ranges but this is something I do own so
we're gonna go ahead and start with that
Nicole is here hi Nicole and Diana and
Florrie oh my goodness the team is here
let's see I'm all uh days the day z9t
says I'm always early but she never says
my name early but not early enough so
thanks youtube for the late notification
I see you days with Daisy 90 I see
Angela says any thoughts on the soft
glam that's coming out I'm not getting
it it looks nice but I'm not getting it
I don't think I'm gonna do primer today
I don't know should I do primer I forgot
to grab one you know I didn't grab any
primers let me grab hold on I should
okay let's do
okay we'll grab a cup of primers so we
didn't have this the Facebook group
she's a primer I'm gonna go ahead and
start with this this is the it number 50
serum collagen veil anti-aging primer
now this primer was sent to me in a
mystery box by a mystery subscriber I
have no idea who it was from it does
make me a little bit nervous not knowing
who sent it to me uh but I'm trusting in
the fates that no one is trying to
poison me
I've used it a couple of times and I
have been enjoying it so I'm just kind
of hoping that the person who sent it to
me is not completely and totally insane
I was watching a video on we go and put
this on when I tell you this I was
watching on if you know Kendall Rios I
was watching her Channel and she used to
be a beauty Channel but girl she does
conspiracy theories but she did one on
Brittany Murphy and she was saying how
Brittany Murphy was poisoned and how her
might have been poisoned through like
like over long-term by something and
like oh no it's this whole big thing you
can watch her video for the whole thing
but like it was like right before I got
this mystery box of stuff from a mystery
person with no no return address and it
kind of freaked me out a little bit so I
don't know
and it says maybe it's me and Gigi oh
gosh I hope it's not me and Gigi I mean
I'm done for it it's me Gigi I'm done no
because I mean Gigi is a real person I
don't want to say that mean Gigi's a
murderer because I don't know me and
Gigi so but Kendall actually Kendall and
I used to talk quite often a long time
ago and now she's got seven hundred
thousand some subscribers so
occasionally we chat on through Twitter
a little bit but I wouldn't say she's a
friend of mine but we do know of each
other
Megan says no one ever came forward to
say they sent you all that makeup nope
no one ever said anything hi Sarah but
anyway the primer feels very nice it's
kind of a silicone II primer but it
doesn't feel extra slick or anything and
it seeps into the skin pretty nicely and
I do I do like it it's very nice
so me and Gigi's other account
disappeared too she stopped commenting
all right fancy beauty foundati so let
me tell you I never did a full review
with a Fanta Beauty Foundation I planned
on doing it and then I never did it but
this is my thoughts on it I don't really
like it that much and the reason why is
I find that it cakes up on my skin it
cakes up into my wrinkles and it cakes
up around my nose and on my chin which I
do not like so so yeah it's not my
favorite but it's not terrible I just
don't I think I used too much I did
three pumps and I think three pumps is
too much now let's just go for it it's
really gonna kick up now that I use
three pumps usually I used to when I got
a little carried away but but yeah it
cakes up on me I don't know if it does
it to you or not but it cakes up with me
I have shaved 150 by the way and I do
feel like it's a good match for me let
me go ahead and pull this over here Oh
Andy was asking my shade is yep 150
Fanti broke out Joe skin Oh No Ashley
finally gets the seeming live yeah hey
Carrie says color pop is at Ulta now
apparently I haven't checked to make
sure but it was supposed to go live
today I haven't looked but somebody left
a comment saying that color pop is not
at all ultra stores like I know my
Sephora doesn't have color pop I don't
know if anybody has color pop in their
Sephora stores but I know mine doesn't
mine doesn't have it so I don't know if
it's going to be the same thing my my
Ulta does it have more fee either so no
I feel like this this brush is really
flopping around this is the flat kabuki
brush by outer beauty I think it's just
getting old it's starting to be like
less compact you see how it's like
flopping like this I like my my kabuki
brushes not to move that much and this
one used to be better but it's like I
feel like it's just flopping everywhere
right now but you can see the coverage
on this foundation is really really good
I wish it didn't take up so much but
I'll start noticing it in like I don't
know maybe 15 minutes or so I'll show
you when it starts kicking up it gets
like it settles onto my skin and it just
gets all Bucky
but I'm still going to use it I'm still
thankful to have it but and some people
have it asked me why I put foundation on
my lips it's easier I'm lazy and also I
feel like it makes a nice base for
lipstick I don't know why it's just I
guess the thing it might be something
just in my head I don't know she
releases gem did you pick up the new
essence fresh and foundation I'm hearing
great things about it except for the for
shade range no uh-uh amber says do you
do skincare yes I do right now I'm kind
of trusting out a few things I've got
kind of a base in Polish twice I got a
really nice PR box from drunk elephant
so I'm trying out their moisturizer
right now I'm trying to add a new
product like every week until I get to a
kind of a regimen of drunk elephant to
kind of see how I feel about it so right
now I'm just using their moisturizer but
I want to add in the sea from an X I'm
so excited alright for concealer today I
grab the NYX dark circle concealer
this one has four shades to liked one
medium and one deep which of course is
not very good like I mentioned I need
really need to do better at finding
products that are more inclusive just in
my collection but when I looked at it it
seemed like the shades looks good on
line as far as that they might be able
to work for lots of people I'm just
blending with my fingers cuz I'm being
lazy but clover fairy Hill says Jen you
planted to try the unicorn drops from
Too Faced wasn't planning on getting
anything from that collection I'm kind
of taking a break from Too Faced at
least until I feel like until they come
out with like their strawberry line that
hopefully will come out this summer
Jared teased it like a year though so
I'm hoping that means that it's coming
soon but I feel like two-faced is so hit
and miss and it's so expensive and it's
like I don't know man I don't know Julie
says candy Johnson always covers your
lips with foundation while I feel better
now
she says it cancels out her own lip
color so the lipstick looks better well
then maybe I'm not going crazy because
if candy Johnson believes that then I
must be doing something right because I
believe I believe that she is
genius when it comes to makeup yeah
loopy shrew me hello
yeah Jarrett had ta put like a picture
of champagne with a strawberry in it and
said I've see a new a new collection
being born born born so I'm really
excited hopefully that's still happening
and hopefully it will be announced soon
all right next up we have something the
group did not pick which is the flower
setting powder I'm gonna put this on now
because I my face feels like it needs to
be set you ever just get that feeling
that you just need to set your face like
it just feels like I have makeup on and
I feel like it needs to be set I just
can't even I can't even
and lately I've really been liking using
a flat top kabuki brush for it so I have
kabuki 's that I've been using for
powder and then one day I've been using
for foundation so this is one of my
powder ones and then I just kind of kind
of pack it on and I feel like it gives
me just a beautiful beautiful finish and
I really like this flower setting cutter
this has been my favorite product that
I've tried from Beauty bakery I've tried
some of their lip lips I've tried the
concealer I've tried some of their
eyeshadow palettes and really the only
thing that I can say that I really
really really really really like is the
flower setting powder everything else
has been either okay or hasn't been to
my taste unfortunately Stef says I
should bug Jerrod for a pineapple
watermelon line there you go just fruit
salad who was it that said fruits out
was it Angelica Nyquist that said fruits
oh and I think it might have been I
can't remember though as always says I
love the formula for the chocolate bar
palette I used to really like it and
lately I've kind of been like all right
eye shadow primer we're gonna use the
Urban Decay anti-aging primer potion I
really like this one a lot I've had this
for a while and it's been it's been good
to me I have to say this was not picked
by the group I'll tell you when I get to
one that gettin was picked by the group
a sale ayylmao says I'm happy that you
face stepped away from the peach and
chocolate are coming out with those lace
products but the unicorn collection
looks like X
have deleted I personally in my opinion
I don't think the unicorn collection
looks like expletive deleted I'm just
I'm so over the unicorn thing like if
they're a year too late man on the
unicorn thing I don't know why they
chose to do that I mean they could have
done anything like something passed down
or you know those kinds of colors but
but making it unicorn themed I just
don't think that was a smart move unless
you really truly are targeting teenagers
who I think will get love unicorns
forever I think that that there are a
select group of adults who will love
unicorns forever I think there's always
gonna be people that are gonna love it
but I think they missed a huge market by
going that direction if they had just
changed it to something else you know I
don't know what but maybe just fantasy
you know and they could have had all
different kinds of things you know
mermaids and Dragons and I don't know
Megan says two-face just needs to get
away from their keep kitschy child pack
a childlike packaging of themes yeah I
agree
Kathryn says I actually picked up the
unicorn line stuff and I just like the
colors and ignore the unicorn stuff
which is probably the smart thing to do
if you like the colors it shouldn't
really matter right I mean it makes
sense you're probably more logical than
I am Natalie says there's a teenager
I've never would have been able to
afford to face as a college student I
never were able to afford it
there's no way my parents ever would
have bought me some except for like one
thing for my birthday you know or
Christmas or something like that alright
this was chosen by the group this is the
Julius place of magic palette oh my gosh
I've only used this I think maybe three
times since I got it I love it I just
haven't had because I've been trying so
many eye shadow palettes I haven't had
time you use a lot so so excited when
the group chose this as the as the
eyeshadow palette so this is a brush by
everyday minerals that had this forever
it's super floppy but I do kind of like
it for like a transition shade so I'm
gonna use Nana here and Cassie it
together and then we're going to use
that as a transition shade
by the way I always get asked what this
mirror is this is by simple human and I
always recommend you get it from Bed
Bath &amp;amp; Beyond with a 20% on because it
is pricey but it is amazing Cynthia
wants to know if makeup monsters are
doing a dragon thing theme I believe so
I think that it is makeup monsters
that's doing that which is smart very
very smart I guess we're going I don't
know what we're gonna do I haven't even
decided I just started throwing a color
on my I don't even know what I'm doing
today we're just gonna play and have fun
with just some bright colors let's just
let's just have fun okay um let's do
let's do this shade which you see the
shade the shade is called Faso this one
right here oh this one's really pretty -
this is called Zuba this one is called
Nubia I mean seriously
are you serious right now are you
serious right now they're serious right
now let me swatch one my hand since I
already have it with my really really
back once hey that Dec winter has a
great ahh skincare channel by the way I
think we're gonna go colorful today
let's just go with those colors let's
just have fun let's stripe them out on
the eyes and just have fun um let's do
the the thing is I I don't know how to
create looks with colors I need inspo
shots to help me and I don't have an in
spot today so we're just gonna go for it
and do our best so let's use Faso and
let's put that should we attempt to halo
eye I always do terrible when I do them
but we can attempt it anyway just for
fun
and we can deepen it up a little bit on
the corners I know that's a light shade
but oh my gosh it's so pretty
makeups supposed to be fun I think we've
lost that some on YouTube everybody's so
serious about everything having to be
perfect all the time
we just need to enjoy ourselves and not
take it so stinkin seriously all the
time
okay I'm gonna use one of these darker
shades a little bit to deepen it up
let's see let's use is that darker no
it's not dark enough let's use this
matte shade I don't I'm not gonna
butcher this ye ji de yesh eyed is the
way that I would pronounce that I don't
know if that's correct
Zoe says I have too much eyelid crepe
colorful tends to look and appear as
though a box of crayons melted on my
face hey you know you have to do what
makes you happy and if that doesn't make
you happy
then you shouldn't do it but I think
that everybody should be able to enjoy
color and you know you got to do what
make you got to do what makes you happy
in life you know and nobody said you
can't just play and then wash it off
later I'm gonna try to just bring this
kind of to the outside of the halo I
have no idea what I'm doing
we're just enjoying ourselves right now
you kind of do like a mermaid kind of
style that's fun
Haley is here hello hello that said that
green down the bottom looks stunning oh
my gosh it's called bruise oh this
back-back tell me keep breathing back
don't stop breathing it's gorgeous
alright let's go back in to do the other
side
and if it comes out crazy I don't care
because I'm having fun and you should
have fun too
okay there we go
guys it looks insane and I okay now I'm
gonna Pat that pink shade that Zuba
Shane that one in the center of my lid
right there BAM
oh you know what I should have done I
should have done the purple first let's
see if I can kind of get that around the
outside and we'll do like a rainbow
inside the eye just look at that how fun
how fun how fun thank you to the
Facebook group for picking picking this
pallet April says I have every julius
place i palette but i think i'm going to
pass on the three warrior palettes
definitely need a low buy yeah i'm gonna
do it a little differently I'm gonna put
the purple all over the center and then
pop the pink on the inside like that yos
gonna blend it out a little bit there oh
yeah
that's so fun yeah I mean there's
there's a point where it you know it
gets a little excessive especially if
you're just using it for your own
purposes um but you know what and people
collect things
people collect model trains and people
collect you know statues and all kinds
of crazy stuff I just dipped right back
into that Nana color the brownish shade
that one right there one of the one in
the middle and I'm just kind of blending
out the crease up here and kind of
pulling that together a little bit but
people clicked all kinds of stuff
what's wrong with collecting makeup if
that's your thing and it's not you know
cutting into things that you absolutely
need to buy you know what I mean okay
sometimes it's just for collection
purposes people collect action figures
and all that and people don't give them
a hard time I think people should
collect the things that bring them joy
as long as they have the means to do it
and it's not like they're not choosing
that or food you know or it's not making
them going to severe debt
that is fun look at that okay so now
let's say I feel like I needs to blend
my inner corner a little bit
I know corners a little crazy okay then
let's just blend a little more rambling
blender okay
Kari says I want to try busy up but he
just can't bring myself to pay the money
for it honestly I'm saying this an
uncharged you know like I know like
Stephanie loves busy arts so many of my
subscribers love busy art but I just
can't look busy are I'm not I don't
enjoy it that much like I try really
hard but like I honestly don't enjoy it
that much and I don't know why everybody
else seems to love it um let's see let's
do my brows and then I might go back in
and lighten up underneath my brow bone a
little bit so let's do I just got a
brand new brow product this was calling
to me this is the Maybelline brows
precise a fiber volume I'm looking for
something to replace the Gimme brow if
you saw him what's up and makeup which I
don't think that benefit really
advertised it very well the reason why
the benefit gimme brow was recalled and
I believe Megan was a big part of
bringing this to light for the show is
that it has it was contaminated with a
bacteria that is antibiotic resistant
and benefit made it sound like you could
still keep using it on your brows and it
wasn't that big of a deal and then we
find out through the FDA's website that
it was recalled for having this bacteria
in it so creepy right so I'm trying to
find a replacement for that if you have
any suggestions I would love to know
what you think but I figured I would try
this I need to try more drugstore stuff
I want to start doing more dupe videos
because I feel like that would be so
helpful like with the size of my
collection I feel like dupe videos would
be awesome you know like like just buy a
bunch of highlighters from the drugstore
and then just dupe the heck out of my
collection with them
you know Kari says hey Liv loves your
makeup I love it you always live here hi
Liv how are you my friend Liv sent me a
really nice email or oil in the week
thank you Liv that really meant a lot to
me we've been talking back and forth
through email I appreciate her so much
she's such a nice person very
considerate and kind so as far as this
brow product I feel like it is very thin
so if you like a very soft brow look
this may be a good one for you or if
you're new to doing brows I feel like
this would be good for you I thought if
you have very very thin brows or if
you're just trying to draw on brows like
you don't have a lot of brow hair you
might not like it because I feel like
this is more of like a filling in kind
of brow product instead of a lick one
that would actually create a brow for
you so so yeah I feel like this is
definitely has a target market which
would be me because I have brow hair I
just need it to fill it in to full - um
to fill it out so yes so this is gonna
be a yes for me so far but I don't this
is total first impression if it gives me
a reaction later I don't want you to buy
it at this boy because oh no palette I
just pulled it out of the package but so
far so good and it's very very light
it's not super opaque which is nice for
like a beginner so Maybelline brow
precise fiber volumizer and deep brown
as what I bought that's what that is
there you go okay let's do a little bit
of eyeliner so we're gonna go into NYX
epic ink which is my current favor
actually before we do that let me go
ahead and do a little bit more on my
brow bone because I'm noticing I need
something a little bit lighter just to
highlight my brow bone a little bit now
he says do you go live at this time
every Sunday no I don't usually it is at
10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Sundays but
the last Sunday of the month I aim to do
one at night so that different people
can join we're gonna do this shade kasi
and try to just calm down the brow bone
a little bit just a little bit that
looks nice that looks so much better
oh I like that so much better why did I
close the pallet hen says recently I
started getting into makeup as a
beginner I need i shudders that blend
very easy please let me know your
recommendations I love color not all
neutrals I love to be funky that blend
easily hmm
well hmm
well as far as like because you're
saying you love color I would say the
genius place palettes are very easy to
blend and they do have some really
bright beautiful colors in them they're
very very bold so you just have to be
prepared for that bowl I mean this is
insane you know but yeah I mean they're
very easy to work with very easy so I
would say GV this place is a great brand
to start with colored rain is all I
would say is a little bit more intensely
pigmented so I feel like that one is a
little bit more difficult it's kind of
closer to like the Anasazi of Beverly
Hills formula or the pigment is just
really really pigmented so I wouldn't
say that those are necessarily the best
for beginners just because they're they
put they pack on so much pigment that
sometimes it's a little bit hard to not
go to too much you know what I mean
where I feel like devious places a
little bit better with that live says
NYX ultimate palette is pretty good too
yes the NYX palettes are actually really
good overall I remember they had a line
from NYX that was like named after
cities I did not like those at all but
the pop ones any of that what is it the
pop was it called what was that called
like pops something Stacey says that
Jacqueline helped out yes the Jacqueline
home morphe palette definitely that is a
good one and those are that's that's the
only morphe palette at this point that I
can recommend is the Jacqueline Hill one
the other ones I do not enjoy and I do
not have a Murphy code I do not think I
will ever have a Murphy code they've
never offered me one and I don't think I
would accept it even if I did I'm on pop
Thank You florea
to the rescue I bought pop I love those
the next pilots actually some of them
really do have some nice pigment to them
this eye look is actually coming
together quite nicely it's not so bad
Jen says yeah thanks for responding I
seriously makes me feel special you are
special Jen live and Stephanie Nicole my
number one you have great tight tasting
channels great tasting channels I agree
I think we're the best two-time just
there's so many good channels on YouTube
but I happen to like live and Stephanie
too I'm with you there is a whole group
of people I swear there is a group
there's a group of really really good
influencers coming up there's there some
really really good channels out there
Jamie says my first palate purchase was
a jacqueline whole by morphe palette
it's a good one but a little
overwhelming for beginner too many
options maybe I can see that so maybe
like a NYX palette might be better so
maybe maybe Oh Marinella is here altas
makeup sets around the holidays have
really good color selection hoping they
start doing sets all year round again
says they have improved over time yes
and if you can get like that I really
like the Tarte set that I got it's not a
lot it's not quite as bold but the Tarte
holiday set that I gotten was really
really good I was surprised I've heard
the tartlet and bloom palette is really
good but I don't own that one all right
let's move on so for mascara I uncovered
this that I hadn't opened yet and I'm so
excited this is this feel like he's not
huge mascara in the deluxe sample size
and oh my gosh this is an amazing
mascara it's so good it's really really
good I don't think I would ever buy a
full size of it but sample size if you
can get your hands on it highly
recommend especially unlike those two
four favorites kits and things it is
really really good it is just absolutely
beautiful I'll zoom in so you can see it
it's a little bit on the clumpy side but
it gives beautiful volume and beautiful
length I'll show you in a second one
coat
girlfriend her boyfriend one coat you
ready for this turn a night dead Dona
Ana Ana check it out
hmm we think I really like it I think
it's amazing
Teresa wants to know if it comes in
waterproof I don't think so
Angela says Susan yes modern Renaissance
which is a great staple and I really
like the modern renaissance palette a
lot my only issue with Anastasia
palettes is that they are so intense and
so pigmented that I don't know if I
would recommend them for a beginner
unless they really know how to use a
light light hand and tapping off the
brush I mean they probably get used to
it
you know with a you know a couple days
practice it's not like it's that hard
but this is such a fun look I'm having
so much fun I'm glad I decided to go a
little crazy today because this actually
came out pretty cute I'm kind of
impressed with myself right now Debbie
says anyone watching lost her luxe and
her new puppy she's fostering you know I
don't think I've ever watched any of
Katies videos and I just subscribed to
desi I don't know like two weeks ago
I was so off the train so off the train
I don't even know why but they seem like
really nice people they genuinely do but
two years ago I wouldn't have been able
to pick them out of a lineup
it's funny how people like and have
millions and millions of subscribers and
I'm like who's that they seem like
really nice people April says the new
benefit one get so clumpy on my lashes
yeah I haven't tried it yet I've heard
kind of mixed things about it alright
I'm gonna go in the lower lash line with
the the blue that I had used that I'm
not gonna butcher again I think I
already butchered it once and just put a
little bit on the lower lash line back
over here now that I put mask
err on it which I shouldn't have not
used to putting mascara on my lower lash
line but people have been telling me I
need to do it Steph says the Jen I knew
years ago wasn't this adventurous kudos
staff has been subscribed to the channel
for how long like probably since I was
on my porch right I'm having fun and I
love it
ok I'm going to put a little bit about
that purple that your iridescent purple
shade I'm gonna put in the inner corner
BAM oh that is so bad
there we go yeah Lori's like right I
know if Lori's been around forever -
Laura says bad girl bang works for me
just can't wiggle it on your lashes at
clumps like crazy great tip Laura thank
you for that Morgan says lol seems like
everybody hates it I'm assuming she
means the mascara say says I can't stop
watching raw beauty Christy she's my
kindred spirit I love her too I adore
Christy I got to spend about five
minutes with her once I ran into her
outside of a hotel in New York City and
stopped her and Alex faction and
fangirling over her for a few minutes
this was way back like two years ago and
we kind of kept in touch through like
the NYX face awards and stuff she's a
wonderful person Megan says I don't even
know anything about that Wow Allan is
guy until who is Allen Allen eyes all
Annoying about that Marianne's music
says GG periscope any more or that died
I do periscope every Friday afternoon
getting ready for what's hip and makeup
so I'm on one one day a week I used to
be on all the time I used to cook on
periscope with everybody and that was
fun you were probably on then
oh no I'm gonna block somebody real
quick they just had a very inappropriate
name so I'm assuming they're up to no
good okay so now we're gonna just leave
it like that for the eyes and now we'll
do cheek so this was picked by the group
this is the gala for Nia blush by
benefit and my big gripe about this is
when it came they'd sent me this in PR
but when it came it had that gold
beautiful gold Sun in there and it was
just overspray it's gone so now the
prints there but the gold is gone and it
makes me sad I wish that the actual
product had been gold in there and so
that it could forever mix in I think
that would have been beautiful I don't
know if how possible that is in
formulation but that would have been
beautiful it is a very very pretty blush
I'm gonna just do it a thick swatch on
my finger so you can see and on my hands
so you can see kind of the tone of it
it's very pretty and it can it can
definitely build up so if you're of a
medium or deeper skin tone you might be
able to get this to build up beautifully
on your skin at least I would hope that
you'd be able to I haven't ever seen a
woman of color or man of color use this
blush though so I can't speak from
seeing it personally but a my skin tone
I think it looks very pretty I don't
know if you're going to be able to see
it with my terrible webcam quality on my
no you can't see it I put a little bit
more on so that you'll be able to see it
I'm my I'm gonna look like a clown in
real life but I'm gonna put more on so
you can see it now you can't really see
it
okay well we'll load it up there we go
okay so hopefully you'll be able to see
it now I'm about 30 seconds delayed on
those on the playback yeah you should be
able to see it a little bit live says it
reminds me of the bombs frat boy it is
similar I find this one I think this
one's a little bit brighter but that
one's a little bit more subtle nicole
says overspray do you makeup setting
spray no actually it's a little bit
different it's like a metallic spray
that they actually spray over the
product right
pull it up on here so you can see what
I'm talking about
yeah and I'll show you what it looked
like when I got it
California blush okay let me see here it
is it's it's loading so you can see what
it looked like when I bought it
okay so do you see the gold that's on
the Sun so that was an overspray that
was a spray of gold that they put on the
product that as soon as you started
using it it just blended away so that is
that's an overspray Physicians Formula
is famous for using over sprays I did
see that someone had said they used gala
for neon their eyes which i think is
really really smart okay the next thing
that was requested by the group was the
Oprah Beverly Hills highlighter if you
do not know I love over highlighters my
big complaint about over highlighters is
the price is insane I would love to dupe
some of these for you because they're
ridiculously priced and they are so
stinking gorgeous when I use Beverly
Hills I usually use over here because I
find this shade here to be too deep for
my skin tone it just ends up any kind of
gold highlighter just looks weird on me
I don't like it at all I feel like if
you're gonna invest in a highlighter
from Oprah I feel like Beverly Hills is
a really good one to invest in just
because you do get so many choices of
shade and you can take a brush and you
can really target in you know two of
them at least and get different colors
in there I think what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna focus in on the pink and the
white here and and use that as a
highlight it's so pretty wait till you
see this
so pretty oh my gosh you see that I hope
you can see that this is LA so I can't
see if you can see it but it is just
gorgeous oh wait you couldn't see it you
could see it a little bit that was a
little too low on the camera let's go in
a little higher
nyan says I'm I have the over highlight
palette but pricey but gorgeous yes oh
my gosh said things ridiculously
expensive but yeah I really really like
it Valerie says the physicians formulas
shimmer brick would be a good dupe that
is good to know thank you so much for
that I need to get a better camera for
these live streams because I want you to
be able to see things better than you
can see them alright so it looks like my
idiot self did not bring over anything
for contour or flips okay well if you
get ready with me on periscope you know
I'm terrible at picking out lip people
always have to help me on periscope to
pick out lip products because I really
am truly awful at it so I'm gonna go
ahead and I'm gonna grab a few lip
choices I don't him in a contour today
just because I just it wasn't part of
what they had picked and I think we're
done with everything they picked yep
they fit take the airbrush foundation in
the benefit California the essence oh
you know what I used the wrong primer Oh
my group I'm so sorry I will use it next
week I forgot oh and I had it here too
it was supposed to be the essence i
heart color primer and i think it rolled
on the floor I'm sorry I'll use it next
time the essence I heart color primer I
will tell you though that's not really
my favorite primer I need to get the
Milani
eye primer because I've heard that's an
excellent drugstore primer and I've
never used it I'm so upset because it's
on the list okay sorry I shadow palette
I only have five things to do five
things you think I'd be able to do that
dubious place management holiday using
them the Ofra Beverly Hills so let me go
grab a few lip products because I forgot
Liv says a cool tone nude would be
pretty let's do that and go with what
lift says okay and I've got all my cool
tone nudes over here let's try this one
and see how this goes all right this is
Too Faced sex on the peach which is a
beautiful formula it is a cool tone ooh
it smells like like like creamy peaches
it smells so good oh I don't think these
things got enough height when they came
out not enough people talked about these
it's a beautiful formula
good job live I like it hopefully it'll
look good on camera as well but it
really does look pretty in person I feel
like I need lashes with this look but
maybe I'll just put on another coat of
the mascara Steph would have gone pink I
think pink would look nice too
I do like this though it's Chi feel like
it my eyes are kind of weak though like
my lashes like I need more lashes I need
more boom Angela wants more
recommendations from Lev about any more
cool toned nudes
I'll let Liv give you recommendations on
that excuse me uh what are some of the
other ones that I like OCC lip tars make
some really good ones I really like the
liquid lipsticks from bareMinerals they
make some really nice ones Tiffany says
mix the why not the nude and the pink I
could I could Samantha says she likes it
lash free Liz says wear lashes yesterday
and they took my real eyelashes off with
them oh no that's terrible Sammy says
same thing nude and pink okay
I see a little pink in the center almost
like an ombre from Amy hmm okay well
let's let's try it why not we got time
actually let me put on one more coat of
the mascara real quick and then we'll
try to find a nice pink to put in the
middle or even just to spice it up a
little bit I just feel like my lashes
need to be like a little bit more
vehement okay oh I'm so mad about the
whole primer thing like kicking my stuff
like really Jen really hold on let me
get a pink I've Pink's right here
let's do okay this is one that I really
really like a lot and this this formula
got such bad reviews and I actually
really like it and I don't know why
people don't like it this is the vise
liquid lipstick by Urban Decay and this
is in the shade trivial and this is the
eye thing the only one that I own so
maybe this was the only good one all no
but I really like it let's just start
with it in the middle and see what
happens I don't know if it's enough of a
contrast I don't think it contrasted
enough I think I might need like a
brighter one I think this just kind of
blended in so that did not work but I
think that was my choice a light bright
in the middle gives you a plump juicy
look Shauna says well I need to go
brighter then okay we're gonna have to
go into the pink Pink's so I got nudie
pinks I gonna have to go on the pink
pinks and the pink Pink's your way back
there I'm not gonna be able to stretch
my microphone so I'm gonna pull this
down hope it's not too loud right back
hold on
okay
all right I grabbed three pinks I
grabbed juice I grabbed two color pops I
grabbed juice bar which looks like that
and then I grabbed I heart this bicolor
pop which is super bright and then I
grabbed this one by essence this is
called natural beauty which I don't
think it's gonna be bright enough have I
not ever used that what is wrong with me
why don't I buy stuff and then not use
it Barbie pink scare me Carrie says Pete
don't tell anybody get hurt me too oh
gosh okay so let's start let's start
with juice bar and work our way up and
see what happens let's go a little more
subtle first
I don't think it's enough I don't think
it's enough
yep Megan and Steph agreed on juice bar
Shirley says juice bar I don't think
it's enough though I think we need more
still to light Debbie I agree I agree
see now you guys know what it's like for
me on periscope it's the same thing we
go through every single week every
single week if you ever want to join us
on periscope it really is a lot of fun
if you follow me on Twitter its touch
throws out a notification on Twitter
let's try a juice bar I mean let's try
it I heart this oh here it comes here it
comes oh snap I don't know I'm kind of
taking it a little too far good thing
I'm not going anywhere it doesn't really
matter if it turns out kind of stupid
doesn't even matter Margaret's here
hello Valerie says I feel like we're
talking on periscope I know right yup
Zoey says they're all too warm why is it
pink always warm then you have a really
truly cool pink cuz I thought the whole
like pinks and reds were always warm you
know I mean we can do like a oh no am i
is that a stupid thing to say
you know lip topper I mean it looks
bright here it doesn't look nearly as
bright on the replay like on the on the
screen as it does for reals pink are
Nicole says pink are something cooler
toned I don't know man purpley pink
would be more cool I guess so like a
fuchsia I don't know it's super bright
here let's just have fun who cares man
let's just do it
all right let's go get some purple
purpley Pink's liner might help that's
true that's true
let's try it okay Oh like blue base Reds
there you go thank you Megan for
explaining that to me duh alright I'll
be right back hold on a second oh wait
you're right yeah I think some Reds are
like because
anything about the the spectrum of color
we've got orange red those are like the
warms and then the blues and the purples
are cool but I see what you're saying is
like a blue base red would be more cool
on that side but then pink I guess mean
like a blue tone pink like a purpley
pink I get what you're trying to say
okay all right let's get some purple
could you hear any of that because my
mic wasn't on hopefully all right we're
layering we're going for my mic line
we're layering it up like a cake right
now
so right now we've got on one two three
different lipsticks we're gonna add
number four Oh Steph says pink opal
alchemist in the center that is smart
we're gonna add that but I got that
right over there I know exactly where
that is okay I grab you another color
pop this is sauce which is the one that
I was wearing I think I wear this a
couple weeks ago it's like a malty
purple which I don't think is gonna be
dark enough and then I collect grab this
Clinique one it's in the shade pow pop
it's a clinic pop mat it's actually not
that much different is it the same thing
of color
no this one's a little more Mavi and
then the color the clinic one is a
little brighter let's do the Clinique
one Debbie said it'll wear off when you
eat anyway I know right Vance's Beauty
says hello it's color bias Jenna I'm a
painter and I have warm and cool of each
primary otherwise some colors don't come
out vibrant so there's no such thing as
a truly neutral primary well there you
go
good to know Liv says just Alchemist I
know it's such a it's such a fun palette
I love that thing all right let's try
this
I'm just gonna keep layering it looks
like I just ate a popsicle
how's that it looks crazy in person it
looks so much brighter than it's coming
off to you like there it looks insanely
bright like I wish you were seeing it
representative let me turn these lights
down a little bit because I think the
lights are blowing it out let me see if
I can turn these down hold on wait wrong
wrong little guy hold on well let's try
that let me see I don't know if you'll
be able to see the difference lip topper
will save everything
come on oh my gosh I'm watching the
replay and seeing like my big old shirt
as I'm trying to turn the light say sis
now I want a popsicle a bomb pop me too
you know I don't know if you can see the
color look how bright it is it's a
little bit brighter than what you then
even what you're seeing now it's really
really really really really bright mama
Shawna says I do use a lip liner when I
do this to my lips which I didn't use a
lip liner at all
but I'm gonna turn the light back up
because it is a little bit too dark turn
up a little bit okay let me go ahead and
let's get the Alchemist that I can reach
that's right here here we go
it's add a little bit per staff pink
opal right here if you like playing with
makeup and you don't own the alchemist I
definitely recommend it it is really fun
and I just need to get a better camera
some my to-do list do you think it's
just fun I'm waiting for the replay - oh
yeah you can see it you can see it it
just gives it a little bit more of that
like iridescent shine it's fun it's
really fun
I thought the alchemist was eyeshadow it
could be used for anything I did do a
full review on this where I showed this
over a lot of lip colors and also I used
I use it on the eyes I can't remember
it's been a while since I did it but I
do a full review on this if you look for
Jen loves reviews alchemist if you
search for it in youtube you'll find it
and the stuff says now it's perfect
Thank You Steph BAM check mark for the
collective brain yup no rules in makeup
Jenna I am with you I am with you
Shana says you never talk about nails
but that wall of nail polish you should
because people people might chant my
subscribers do not like nail polish
videos like every time we do a nail
polish video it tanks like it gets like
a third or a quarter of the amount
amount of views other videos get so
that's why I don't do nail polish videos
they just they tank reads fine but yeah
this can be used for all kinds of stuff
you can use it on your cheeks you use on
your eyes you can use on your lips you
can use wherever you want it's wonderful
Shauna says what do you what you just
did made your lips look plumper perfect
Thank You Shauna Thank You collective
brain I appreciate you all you know you
guys know my training is not in makeup I
have four degrees and none of them have
anything to do with cosmetics so it's
like you know I'm just an enthusiast
just like ever that are watching YouTube
videos and makeup is just a fun passion
for me it's not a something that I'm
formally trained in it's just I'm kind
of learning as I go and just having fun
with it one thing that I do have in my
bones is being very analytical which
helps me I feel to be an excellent
makeup reviewer so I think that's where
you know I feel like this is a great
place for me to be expressing myself as
with
doing makeup reviews and I feel like I'm
I'm pretty darn good at it even though
I'm not a trained trained application of
makeup I feel like I can really analyze
good things and bad things about makeup
so Allah says teacher power exactly
exactly and the fact that I've you know
taught hundreds of kids how to achieve
in a science fair and I had one of my
when I taught self self-contained
special education one of my students one
of my kids with learning disabilities he
won the science fair in fifth grade and
he did it on his own
with his idea we just helped him with he
got his modifications and all of that
but the whole project was him it was his
idea
and he won and I am darned Prestel darn
proud of that and he was like over the
moon with b1 and he deserved it too he
truly deserved it he did such a good job
but anyway you know teaching is such a
wonderful beautiful profession and I
miss it every day I miss the kids and
this is kind of my way of doing that now
where I get to kind of teach and still
kind of do science fair kinds of stuff I
love teaching science fair so when I do
my makeup reviews I'm always very
scientific when I test things which is
makes things a lot harder to do but I
feel like it becomes more accurate
because of it Liv says best feeling
being the teacher it really is it's a
fantastic job I'm hoping they can get
things together
in the in the politics of it but yeah
overall Kelsey says my mom was a special
a teacher for thirty years bless her
start a soul but bless her heart bless
her soul bless her everything bless her
brain because that is a it's a hard job
I did I did self-contained special ed
for five years and I went to my
principal and I said I cannot do this
anymore
I was like I cannot do this anymore so
she created a position for me because
she wanted me to stay in special ID she
created a position for me and inclusion
so that I would just walk around and
help the kids that were in inclusion and
then I went to a different school and
did inclusion and then I did general
lead for a year and then I went back
into inclusion and then
but yeah but teaching really is a
beautiful beautiful profession and it's
a passion project you have to have a
passion in order to be a teacher you
know Stacy says I don't the patience for
teaching it definitely takes a lot of
patience absolutely Florrie says she's
leaving by my friend florea
I appreciate you I'm gonna be leaving
soon too Samantha says I teach second
grade it keeps getting harder oh my gosh
second grade is a tough age - because
it's like right before they're getting
into the more complicated stuff so it's
like such an important preparatory year
second grade is is a critical year so
definitely my husband's a martial arts
teacher that's awesome
very cool Steph says my mom was a
Spanish and French teacher for four
years no BS past her good for her now
Maria says my mom homeschooled me and my
three siblings by herself and she's my
hero
I don't know how teachers do it but
they're here is for sure totally agree
Natalie I have a huge respect for
teachers I can you know I I could ever
do it or if you make me I can never do
it it's a hard job it really is Carrie
says you're so good at reviews I wait
wait to hear your beautiful person thank
you Carrie I appreciate that Mary Ann
says my daughter plays they go into
teaching what I would recommend that
your daughter do is spend some time see
if she can volunteer in a school for at
least a month before she goes into
teaching maybe you know I honestly like
if she's taking prerequisites like see
if she can like have a day where she
volunteers in a school for you know
every day for at least a semester if
it's one day a week to really see what
it's like because there are so many
teachers that go into it in college and
then by the time they're getting ready
to graduate they're just not like once
they do their internship they get like
oh my gosh this is what it's really like
and by then they've invested all this
time so they just go into teaching and
then they end up switching professions
within a couple of years so I definitely
recommend her trying to get into a
school and teaching either substitute
teaching or volunteering as soon as
possible I don't know how old she is but
if she's in high school like if she's
you know it has a local school she can
volunteer at I would definitely
recommend that or like occasional
substitute or something like
because she's there's so many kids go to
college I mean in all professions this I
know totally off topic but so many kids
go to college in all professions and
they have no idea what they want to be
and they invest all this money in
college and then they realize that
they're not even going to use their
degree and they spent all this money and
it's it's it's the biggest racket in my
opinion unless you really truly know
what you're doing and I know that for me
personally I'm gonna encourage my kids
to not go to college out of high school
unless they 100% are sure at least 90 80
80 90 percent sure that they know what
they want to do I'm gonna try to get
them in into whatever field they want to
do try to get them to volunteer to get
get into it before they go to college no
one says you have to go to college right
after high school that's what I'm going
to encourage my kids to do and I
encourage parents to do what they feel
is right for their kids but so many
people just mess up right out of high
school and waste so much money you know
and college isn't even necessary for a
lot of professions at this point you
know there's so many professions you
need to go to college yeah Steph says I
would agree I'm not using there's so
many people yellow says take a gap year
absolutely absolutely all right I should
probably go at 6:07 I gotta make dinner
I didn't started making dinner yet I got
a meatloaf to cook so I'm gonna go ahead
and pop off here it would be great one
time to do a chat that's just completely
off java go make up like just say you
know what we're not talking about makeup
today we're gonna talk about all kinds
of other stuff just for fun I was
actually thinking today because I know
I'm I'm like talking and I said I was
going to go but last night I had a
wonderful opportunity to meet up with a
company that in it they they hook up
brands with influencers but they also
hook up influencers with other
influencers in the area so I got to meet
like when I was like 15 or 20 different
channels there was a pilot the
Republican politics channel there there
was a Cooking Channel there was a
two-family vlogging channels there were
some beauty channels there there was a
fitness channel a you know I said a
Cooking Channel there was a couple's
Channel oh my gosh they're amazing their
channel is called slice and rice dying
laughing but
anyway so what was my point so anyway I
was thinking about after like washing
some of their channels I was thinking
about starting a vlog channel for
occasional content so like if you've
been around my channel for a while you
know that I did family vlogs for the
summer time for when I went to Iceland
and then also when we went two summers
ago in our long road trip we're going on
another road trip this summer so instead
of putting that stuff on my beauty
Channel I was thinking about doing it on
a vlog Channel so that it wouldn't like
my beauty channel would just pretty much
be non-active for the summer and then
we'd move over to the vlog channel for
the family stuff for people that were
interested and if I could I might put up
a beauty video here in there but we're
gonna be gone for like two months this
summer which I'll get into it more later
but then then at least I'm not clogging
up the beauty Channel so I'd love to
know your thoughts about that if you
would go over and subscribe to a vlog
channel if you're interested in that or
if you'd rather me just put it on the
beauty Channel I'd love to know what you
guys think it's up to you guys anyway I
figured I throw that out there because
it's nothing solid right now I'm still
thinking it's like a thinking in process
okay but um but anyway I should pop off
here and go make some dinner because I'm
sure my family is getting hungry and you
know I got to feed them or else if you
don't eat you dies to feed my children
but anyway that was kind of a stupid
thing to say but you know it's live man
it's live all right I'm gonna pop off
here thanks so much for being here in
live chat this is really fun and I will
see you all when will I see you I'll see
you on Tuesday I've got a video getting
ready for you on Tuesday and Thursday of
this week and then we got one set the
makeup again next weekend
all right Mad Love thanks again for
being here Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
