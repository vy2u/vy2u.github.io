the lorac I love brunch palette so sit
back relax grab your mosa and let's get
to talking about some makeup if you've
never been to one of my reviews before
they are quite long and involved so if
you would like to skip ahead to a
specific portion of the video there will
be timestamps those clickable links down
below for you to find exactly what
you're looking for we're going to start
with the fact that this is right now to
my knowledge only available at Ulta I
believe it is available in Ultra stores
as well as Ulta calm this is made in the
united states but some of the
ingredients are made outside of the
united states so as far as this being
cruelty free lorac does have a statement
on their website saying that they are
cruelty free but then they also make the
statement that they do not apply for
cruelty free status with like weeping
bunny and places like that because they
cannot guarantee that the suppliers of
their suppliers are not cruelty free so
they feel a moral obligation not to
apply for those programs so depending on
your level of cruelty fariñas you may
say lorac is cruelty free you may say
that you don't know if lorac is cruelty
free and decide not to purchase from
them I will link an article down below
by cruelty free Kitty about her opinion
on this issue this is however not a
vegan product because some of the
shadows may or may not include an
ingredient called carmine which is made
from beetles so this would not be for
the vegans out there by the way the eye
shadow primary that does come with this
is also not vegan it does have beeswax
in it along with the eye shadow palette
you do get a dual sided brush one is a
little bit shorter a little more dense
and one is quite fluffy I would imagine
this would be for packing color on the
lid even though I do feel like it's a
bit round for packing on the lid and I
don't I wish that the taper went down a
little bit more but I do like this as a
fluffy blending brush it's a little bit
long but it's dense enough and it's
stiff enough that you can really work
the shadow and actually enjoy using it
this lorac behind the scenes eye primer
deluxe sample I visit my favorite primer
I don't find that it works better than
my urban decay better than my Ulta Brown
I do happen to like those better than
this I don't feel like this is quite as
effective it's not a bad primer it's
just not my favorite within this palette
you do get 16 eyeshadows eight of them
are shimmer and eight of them are matte
but unlike some lorac palettes they are
mixed through some lorac palette or you
know they've got all the shimmer
altogether and all the masks all
together they have chosen not to do that
they're kind of mixed through there's no
shadows in here that I feel like they
call a shimmer but aren't really shimmer
except for this one here that's called
eggs Benny this one has some glitter in
it some actual silver glitter in it this
one has some very very maybe some fine
glitter in it but not me it's really
fine if we're going to call that glitter
that one's called pancakes it's more of
a satiny shimmery shade same thing with
Bloody Mary just very very fine fine
sparkle in there but eggs benny has some
significant sparkle in it the rest are
more of like a satiny kind of finish
they're definitely not foiled in any way
they just have kind of a shine a sheen
to them
this palette is $44 it contains 13 point
6 grams of product making it three
dollars and twenty four cents per gram
of product that's if you don't count the
brush and the primer as part of the
value if you're just saying that those
your bonus those don't count this
eyeshadow palette isn't the best value
it's not a terrible value it's kind of
like in the middle - a little more
expensive when you carry compared to
brands like two-faced Urban Decay
palettes like that that I see as being
kind of similar price point brand it's
really not the best value but again it's
not terrible now I did buy one of the
blushes as well that's kind of a little
bonus review we're throwing in for you
there are two blushes in this line this
one is called luma this was the one that
stood out to me is one that I wanted to
try this blush is $23 it contains 5.1
grams of product equaling out to $4 and
51 cents per gram again kind of
middle-of-the-road - a little bit
expensive compared to some other blushes
that are in kind of the same price range
we have the Amazonian 12-hour clay
blushes those are four dollars and
ninety four cents per gram the NARS
blushes are six dollars and 61 cents per
gram
them.the Tuesdays Papa don't peach is
$3.31 their eyeshadow palettes are less
program as well and it cosmetics
radiance ombre blush is two dollars and
23 cents per gram so that is the least
expensive so this one's kind of in the
middle too a little expensive just like
the palette so now my very favorite part
of the review these swatches I'm going
to go ahead and show those to you now so
let's go ahead and look at those now
right here is the I love brunch palette
we're going to start with the first row
lavender eggs benny gluten-free and hot
sauce so lavender was probably the
lamest choice to put first because it's
definitely by far the weakest shade and
the palette
it doesn't swatch well it doesn't work
well it's not good eggs benny is just
okay gluten-free is my favorite in this
row and hot sauce is actually also a
really good shade it doesn't swatch
great but it's a good shade so you can
see in the brush wash how weak lavender
is it's pretty terrible egg is Benny
could be good but there just isn't
enough pigment in there there's a little
bit of sparkle but it kind of falls away
when you actually use it now here are
just evidence of the awesomeness of
gluten free and then hot sauce is a good
shade it's not a great shade but it's a
good shade it does what it's supposed to
do in a very light easy way and then
this is the entire first row it's my
least favorite row overall but gluten
free is definitely the star here now
moving on to the white test the reason
for the white test is to show you what
happens when you kind of over blend the
shadows what may happen if you try to
wear them all day which shadows are
going to last the longest and as you can
see hot sauce is the only one that
really truly sticks around so just be
careful when you're blending these
shadows on this road because if you ever
blend they are going to disappear next
moving on to the second row jelly donut
pancakes sorbet and valet again another
row that isn't fantastic but it's
definitely better than the first row
jelly doughnut is very nice as a brow
bone shade
it's got a lot of opacity to it for
packing on the lid it is a nice color
you can see with the brushed wash the
jelly donut really is in my shade you'd
be able to see it even better on a
deeper skin tone pancakes on the other
hand is a little bit weak it's okay it's
just a little powdery and I don't know
it's not my favorite sorbet I actually
really really like even though it's not
swatching the best here it's a very nice
transition shade on me believe it or not
and I do enjoy it ballet is another
really weak powder to reshape it just
doesn't show up anywhere and it fades
really fast so this is row two all
together and as you can see there really
isn't a lot of color happening here
sorbet is the only one you can even
really see that much on my skin to them
but I would say the winners from this
row are jelly doughnut and sorbet and
I'm wiping very lightly here and you can
see that swear Bay is the only one that
really sticks around you have a little
bit of value a surprisingly but I had a
really hard time working with la on the
lid now this third row is my favorite
row in the palette they're all good if
not great shadows first we have Bloody
Mary
then blueberry scone then moonlight and
then avocado toast which is my absolute
favorite shade in this palette it is
really fun to play with Bloody Mary kind
of blends out it's not a great shade
it's not bad but it just it's kind of
hard to work within that that sparkle
that's there doesn't really stay around
blueberry scone is a very nice shade
it's very mild soft blue so if you want
a little bit of blue without it being
too loud blueberry scones in my shade
moonlight is a nice brightening shade
but I wish it was just a little bit
brighter I wish it had the intensity of
gluten-free but in that yellow kind of
buttery butter cup kind of color and of
course avocado toast oh it's just so
pretty it'll give you a nice pop of
color without being so incredibly
overpowering so again this row is my
absolute favorite
we really like it a lot and for the
white test you can see that these all
hang around pretty well except for
moonlight that fades away one thing I
appreciate about these shadows is they
do stay true to their color when they
start fading away
they don't change to brown or gray as
you like them which is great moving into
that bottom row we have mimosa smoothie
french toast and sundae Funday mimosa is
my absolute favorite shade in this row I
really like it it's very opaque very
bright smoothie they nailed it on the
shimmery purple I wish that they have
been able to do that with the matte
purple but the shimmery purple at least
it definitely holds true to that color
really nice and pigmented French toast
ends up not performing well on the lid
ends up being almost like a wash of
color rather than an opaque color so it
definitely is one of my least favorite
shades in the palette and then Sunday
Funday swatch is really bad but it
actually can perform very nicely on the
eye especially if you pair it with hot
sauce or Bloody Mary it'll kind of beef
up those shades on its own it does look
pretty weak so overall with this row the
only big win is mimosa followed very
closely by smoothie french toast and
sundae sundae just kind of and now with
the white test you'll see that these
hang out pretty well considering that
they're not super deep shades I'm
actually quite impressed
mimosa hangs out the best and all the
rest is kind of fade a little bit but
not completely now you have seen the
swatches of the palette let's go ahead
and go into the demo of how I got this
look
the pigeons me that is just rain ain't
no need to go outside the bay there you
hardly even know we're not trying to
show you songs is the key don't do i
watch bowls waking up maybe we can see
make you banana pancakes their lock is
going back with them attending all the
time the girl jersey that is just rain
they ain't no need to go outside we just
made them la colline mama made a baby
really don't mind about this you're my
little late
because I love to lay a lace we could
close the curtain there like there's no
world outside and we up attended all the
time the girl to me this is just wrong
they no need to go outside
ain't no need ain't no D's can't you see
can't you see rain all day and I don't
mind
telephone painter ring it is too early
don't pick it up we don't need to leave
out everything Levi here
Xena justo either when the whole world
is inside of your arms to really need to
pay attention to deal wake up slow
we're car slow Bay they hardly even know
when I try to show you song it says the
key don't do a walk spoke waking up too
early may believe asleep like banana
thing now it's time ladies and gentlemen
for ingredient analysis this is when I
go to ewg or Environmental Working Group
Oregon other websites that I trust to
tell you about ingredients that are in
these products and whether you need to
be careful of anything with the
ingredients so we're going to start with
the eye shadow palette and then we're
going to talk about the blush the first
thing I want to let you know is that 15
out of the 16 shades do have the same
ingredient in the same order the one
that is different is the shade moonlight
that one it does not have carmine listed
as a possible ingredient and then
there's this ingredient that I cannot
pronounce I'm not even going to dry that
is also in the moonlight but is not in
the other 15 shades that one has no
ingredient concerns it's just different
it's a silicon-based binding agent so
maybe they just had more trouble with
that one kind of sticking together and
being a solid pressed shadow maybe
that's why they used it that's my
speculation so big shocker first
ingredient in this palette is how help
can be irritating to some people there's
also some data gaps for talc people
things as we just don't know about talc
the next one is hexlen palmitate which
is another one that's not a big chakras
pretty much and every single eyeshadow
palette it's a derivative of palm oil
and basically it's an allergen to some
people next one is something called
propylene glycol it's a skin
conditioning agent there's conflicting
statements about some irritation
concerns but polished choice says
there's no concern when it comes to
cosmetics potassium sorbate is a
preservative also irritation concerns
and then with the pigments the yellow
colorant is the same one we see in a lot
of eyeshadow palettes it is lip safe
according to the FDA but there's mixed
data as to whether or not this agreed
yet is bioaccumulative meaning it can
build up in your system by scientists in
Canada the amount used in a product is
regulated in the European Union and
the last one is another colorant which
is called ultramarines and the
ultramarines are not lips safe so make
sure you're not putting these shadows on
your lips I don't know which ones
absolutely contain ultramarines there's
no real way to know according to the
ingredient list it looks like they could
all possibly in contain ultramarine so
just be safe and don't put them on your
lips
now with the blush a lot of the
ingredients that we're in the eyeshadow
are also in the blush so you can
cross-reference that I'll also put that
down in the description below but there
is an ingredient in this that is not in
the eyeshadow palette and that is the
retinol palmitate and it is listed as a
nine on Environmental Working Group
which is a really really high score very
rarely do I see anything above a five in
an ingredient it is a skin conditioning
agent and it's a form of vitamin A so
the big concern about this ingredient is
that it sometimes contained in
sunscreens and there is some evidence to
support that it actually causes skin
sensitivity to sunlight so I'm not sure
how big of a deal it would be in a blush
I'm just going to read what the website
I'll link it down below says it says may
speed the development of skin tumors and
lesions when applied to the skin and the
presence of sunlight it is a known human
reproductive toxin it's banned or found
unsafe in cosmetics in Germany one or
more animal studies showed tumor
formation in low doses because it does
absorb into the skin now polish choice
says that this is absolutely not true
that what they did was they tested this
particular ingredient on rats and they
tested it in full concentration and the
rat had tumors so the amount of that
ingredient that is in a powder blush is
probably insignificant compared to what
it was on the rats that made it seem
like this was something that was really
really bad and shouldn't be in any
cosmetics so they say they're based on a
study for nearly from nearly 20 years
ago that has never been reproduced or
tested under real-life conditions such
as how people use sunscreens that
contain this ingredient also a polished
choice website it says that the Skin
Cancer Foundation phyto photo
biology committee stated that there's no
scientific evidence that retinol
palmitate causes cancer in humans so but
I do want to put it out there just in
case that breaks you out this is
play not something you want to purchase
so now on to my full review so let's
start with the eyeshadow palette there's
a bright spot in here that aren't added
on back I think when it comes down to is
that about half this palette is not good
at all like this shade right here
lavender I don't know what they were
thinking making this the very first
shape because it's the worst shade in
the palette you can see in the swatches
it doesn't show it up at all but then
you have some gems like avocado toast
which is my absolute favorite in here I
also really love mimosa I really love
sorbet I really love gluten free there
are some fantastic shades in here
I bought this knowing it was going to be
a supplemental palette meaning that I
was going to have to pull from other
palettes in order to make this work
because there really are no mid-tone or
deep shades I wish that they had gotten
rid of either hot sauce Bloody Mary or
sundae Funday and done a deep dark
chocolate color to at least give us
something to deepen the look to give
some kind of dimension there's just
nothing there a shade that I absolutely
love though I have to tell you about is
guilt free guilt free is one where if
you do a matte look with this and you
want to just shimmer it up you can layer
guilt-free overtop and we'll give them
all that beautiful shimmer and shine I
really really love that shade I wish
eggs benny i wish that the glitter that
shows up in eggs benny and the swatches
actually stayed on the eyes
unfortunately a lot of these shadows
will fade away if you over blend them if
you're trying to work with multiple
shadows you have to keep going back and
forth back and forth and back and forth
between the shadows to get them to show
up and and be true to color but that
being said i can see some people really
enjoying this palette especially people
that like nice calm color unfortunately
there's so many shades in here that are
duds that i really can't recommend it to
you as a palette i just can't
it's not good some people have been
asking me to compare this to the pastel
goth i do have a live swatch session
that I did impromptu when I unboxed this
I will link down below but I'll show you
just very quickly the pastel goth by
Kat Von D was another pastel palette
that came out recently and you can see
right away the difference in the
brightness of the shadows I mean there's
just no comparison and these will give
you this kind of color payoff these they
look pastel these are not true Castells
in my opinion they're more just very
bright neon lighter tone two shades if
you don't like this because it's too
bright you might like some of the shades
in here but it does break my heart said
it's so many of them are just not good
shadows I do feel like that they're
improving on their their pastel green
and they did have the mint Edition
palette they came out a while back and
this avocado toast is so much better
than the mint shade that was in that
palette so I'm really happy that they
improved it I think that that because of
avocado toast and because of mimosa and
a couple of other shades in here I'm
probably going to keep this talent but
kind of reluctantly because I don't
think it's worth $44 at all I do want to
show this to you this is the lorac
California Dreaming palette this is
actually not my palette this belongs to
my friend Meredith she's a tattoo artist
at our tattoo studio she loves makeup
just as much as I do which is fantastic
to have conversations with her she's
also a wonderful artist I will link her
Instagram down below in case you wanna
check her tattoos out but this palette I
from swatching it I did swatch it but I
have not put it on my eyes because it
doesn't belong to me but I really find
the shade selection in here to be a lot
more interesting as far as the amount of
looks you can get the pigmentation of it
it just seems like a better overall
palette as far as the shade range again
I haven't used it personally Meredith
seems to really like it
reviews seem to be really going on so
just from my limited experience with
this if you're going to pick one of the
two to try lorac eyeshadows I would
recommend the California Dreaming over
this the price program is a little
cheaper with this but you're also not
getting the brush in the primer so that
may make a difference to you so final
thoughts on the palette I feel like it's
good intended I feel like they missed
them all and lastly just a quick review
on the blush I would be very hesitant to
put this on someone of a medium to
deeper skin tone because it is extremely
pastel
and I did put this on my friend that is
a Filipino descent she has a medium all
of you skintone and I put it on her hand
I was like a little like give me your
hand Jenny and I grabbed her hand and
kind of put it on her hand and she was
like why she's amazing though she laughs
you thought was funny cuz I can use her
hand anytime but anyway so when I
blended it out on her it kind of blended
indoor skin tone and it really wasn't
flattering on her it looked very powdery
where with me I feel like it goes on my
cheeks you can see it but it's a very
subtle color so if you like a really
subtle blush with a little bit of a glow
you'll probably really love this lasting
power is pretty good on it it lasts me
good-good through a good six to eight
hours which is wonderful for a blush oh
I forgot to mention lasting power with
this is okay it just really depends on
what shadows you use when you use the
good ones or the bad ones if you use the
good ones it's going to last a lot
longer than if you use the bad ones not
going to lose a lot you know last very
long if you look at the swatches the
ones that tend to wipe away those don't
last as long as the ones that have more
pigmentation that seem to last more on
my arm it's very true to the wipe test
so we use that as a reference but it
does give a little bit of a glow so if
you have textured skin you may like it
you may not of it may accentuate your
pores I didn't find it accentuated my
pores on my face but I don't have large
pores so I can't really speak to that so
if you like a lot of pop a lot of
pigment in your blush you won't like
this if you want something more natural
that you really can't mess up you might
actually really like this blush even
though it's getting terrible reviews
online that's my review of the lorac I
love brunch collection I hope you
enjoyed it if you did definitely make
sure you hit the subscribe button and
the thumbs up button because it makes

video if you want you'll be able to see
