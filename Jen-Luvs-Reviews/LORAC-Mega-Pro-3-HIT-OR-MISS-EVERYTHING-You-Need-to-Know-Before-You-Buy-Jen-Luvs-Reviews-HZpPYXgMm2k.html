and ingredient analysis on the lorac
mega pro 3 palette this came out from
lorac for the holidays this is the third
year in a row they've come out with a
mega Pro palette and this is the third
one that I have purchased I have the
original one which was extremely limited
release mostly on Amazon it was very
weird release up middle a lot of people
really angry thankfully I was able to
get my hands on one of those because now
we can compare and I also have the mega
pro 2 that came out last year so we're
going to be talking about comparing
these three in a minute but first let me
tell you all about the mega pro 3 now
this one is $59 you can only I believe
get it at Ulta Ulta calm or alte
in-store I believe it comes with 32
eyeshadows of those 32 eyeshadows two of
the rows are matte and two are shimmer
it comes in this white packaging which
you can see is already completely filthy
because I've been playing with this a
lot it does have a very large mirror
that flops right down that you know
unless you have something to prop it up
against it's kind of useless I wish that
they would go the urban decay route and
give us that little button like the
little voice button that makes it go oh
no but they don't it just kind of flops
backwards so what I end up doing is I
end up just holding the pout like this
has why there's so many fingerprints on
the mirror if you've never tried lorac
shadows before they kick up a lot of
powder increasing the likelihood that
you will make this absolutely filthy
actually I had one of the members of the
community suggest to get some contact
paper clear contact paper from a craft
store or wherever and put that over the
top of it before you start using it
unfortunately mine was Harvey before
once I got that advice I had already
opened it and used it like twice
beautiful all right before I got the
advice so I just decided to just let it
go but but yeah that's if you do get
this that's one option that you have
but yeah so you you get a lot of neutral
shades there's only
one color shade in here and that's this
pomegranate shade unless you want to
stretch it and say that eggplant is a
color shade olive may be considered a
color shade but overall I mean they're
all pinks and peaches and Browns and
tans there is this gray here and this
gray here which make it very interesting
but overall you're looking at a quite a
neutral palette so the next thing we are
going to do now that I've told you what
it is where you can get it how much it
is all of those things we're going to
show a demo of how I got this look today
I put on only the lorac shadows and I
only use the lorac eyeshadow primer to
kind of show you how this look came
together so you can see how they apply
so let's go ahead and show you that and
I'll break
so now you have seen how they apply to
the eyes let's get into a couple of
things so we are now going to talk about
the ingredient analysis for this we're
gonna talk about whether there's any
scary ingredients in this so when we
talk about this versus the lorac Pro 3
which is the one that I looked up
they're all all the ingredients that are
in this are also in the pro 3 but the
formula they change up the ingredients a
little bit here and there I'm not quite
sure why I don't own the lorac Pro 3 and
they mix up the talc in the mica which
makes it I think would probably make a
pretty big difference also the third
ingredient in the mega pro 3 is
dimethicone which is a silicone and then
the third ingredient in the pro 3 is the
boron nitride basically what they've
done is they just mixed up the order of
all of the ingredients they it's almost
like they took them and they put them in
one of those bingo ball spinners and
we're like let's just spit all these up
and put them in the completely different
order I'm sure that's not what they did
I'm sure they had a logic behind why
they mix them up but you know I haven't
heard such good things about the pro 3i
so just know that it has the same
ingredients but they are in a different
order when you compare this to the
original Pro palette that is when you
see a definite difference in formula we
noticed that in the original Pro formula
there are parabens where in this there
are no parabens
so that makes probably a difference to
some people I know some people can be
sensitive to paraben some people do not
like parabens at all in their eyeshadow
formulas or in any of their makeup so
just know that that is in the original
but it is not in this one now I tried to
find formula dupes with other palettes
but I could not find any formula dupes I
couldn't I could find some that were
just kind of similar but definitely not
in any way the same the closest ones
where the tartlet in bloom that has a
lot of different formulas so I picked
the one that was the closest and that's
the shade charmer really that that
palette has so many different formulas
every shade basically has a different
formula so that one has the first 7 in
green
and
and yeah just the first seven
ingredients and then kaylynn down a
little bit lower so we've got eight out
of 18 ingredients that they share which
is 44% of the tartlet number bloom
pellet has the same ingredients as this
also the chocolate bar palette from Too
Faced shares 50% of the same ingredients
so we've got the first four that are the
same but then mixed up we've got nine
intent from the chocolate bar palette
the sodium D hydro acetic and the silica
and then the boron nitride is number 14
for the chocolate bar palette so again
50% sharing the same ingredients
it's amazing what you start looking -
this how many different ingredients
different companies use for eyeshadow
formulas it's pretty amazing so it's
hard to find even shadows that are even
similar so I was happy to be able to at
least find this close by having use a
tartlet and bloom but I have used the
chocolate bar formula and I do feel like
there are some similarities I do feel
like the lorac Pro formula is definitely
kicks up more powder than the chocolate
bar palette at least for most of the
shades some of the chocolate bars the
shades kick up some powder but these
pretty all they all kick up powder like
every single one of them will make a
huge mess would you notice in the demo I
did have fallout on my face for quite a
long time from that dark brown shade so
now let's look and see whether the
ingredients in the lorac mega pro 3 are
yucky or not according to Environmental
Working Group ewg org I will link them
down below if you want more information
about the ingredients so the first one
that comes up is talc now talc is one of
those ingredients that some people are
sensitive to some people just cannot
have talc in their products I'm gonna
read this to you it says talc can be
contaminated with asbestos fibers posing
risks for respiratory toxicity and
cancer so that's if you're breathing it
in you're not going to be breathing in
your eyeshadows most likely so I don't
know how how much that's going to affect
you but it does say that studies by the
national toxicology panel demonstrating
that cosmetic grade talc free of
asbestos is a form of magnesium
silicates they can also be tossed toxic
and carcinogenic for the one shade
licorice talc is further down but number
two ingredient and most of this palette
is talc so if that bothers you you're
not going to want to get this so I'm
always looking for new information and
this is a new article that I found it
says natural tout contains asbestos a
substance that may leave
lung cancer however topham products
using cosmetics have been free of
asbestos since the 1970s some studies
have reported small increases in ovarian
cancer with the use of asbestos free
talcum powder but studies are
conflicting and the results are not
definitive the American Cancer Society
suggests cornstarch base cosmetics might
be an alternative in those concerned
about talc use so basically just sounds
like a kind of a messy study that isn't
really conclusive at least according to
drugs calm so I take it take it anything
and interpret it as you will but that's
kind of that's where the research stands
on it now the next one that is kind of a
yuck but not really as dimethicone
because we are putting it on our eyes
typically people don't have problems
with acne on their eyes I'm at the cone
is sometimes acne causing when it's in
foundations and things like that but
because it's an eye shadow I'm not
personally too concerned about that the
next one is at the hexyl palmitate there
is an acne concern again it's a
derivative of palm oil it's used as a
skin conditioning agent it can be a
human irritant there is strong evidence
only for product use around the eyes on
the skin or ones that can be turned into
an airborne product so just be aware of
that that that could be an irritant and
that is by cosmetic ingredient review
assessments now I did find another
article about this on truth and aging
I'm always finding new stuff
it says the cosmetic ingredient review
expert panel found that in skin tests
with palmitate and with products
containing the palmitate one of three
products containing 40 to 50 percent at
the hexyl palmitate produced a mild
irritation however no skin care product
contains this high of concentration of
the ingredients Bailey this just means
there they were looking in that study at
40 to 50 percent of the product being
made of this ethical palmitate and I'd
there's no way that there's forty to
fifty percent of that ingredient in this
especially since it's the fourth
ingredient behind my cats how think
tokens I met the cone I mean chances are
there's very little compared to the
forty to fifty percent that was in the
study so I'm just trying to provide you
with all of the information as I find it
the next one is propylene glycol
propylene glycol is a small organic
alcohol commonly used as a skin
auditioning agent it's been associated
with an irritant and allergic contact
dermatitis as well as contact earth
arctic area and humans so where someone
has to take like benadryl to fight off
the effects of it
these sensitization effects can be
manifested at propylene glycol
concentrations of as low as 2% of course
I don't know how much of that ingredient
is in this it may be 2% it may be less
it may be more I don't know
it says classifies it expected to be
toxic or harmful by the Environment
Canada domestic substance list so that
is that ingredient so just be careful if
you have sensitive skin you may not be
able this may not agree with you
potassium sorbate is the next one
potassium sorbate is a potassium salt of
sorbic acid and naturally occurring
antimicrobial compound used as a
preservative it says it is a human skin
toxin or allergen there is strong
evidence from the cosmetic ingredient
review assessments in Washington DC and
then the final one is a yellow pigment
that's used in some of these called CI
191 for zero and it is a persistent or
bio cumulative at a moderate to high
toxicity concern in humans so that it it
builds up in the system we've talked
about bioaccumulation in other videos
they worry about using this ingredient
so much that it accumulates in the body
and then causes it to be toxic in the
body of course this is a yellow pigment
this is very very very low on the
ingredient list so I don't know how much
it would take to be bio accumulative to
the point where it's harmful to you but
just so you know that is in here alright
so now we're gonna go into some arm
swatches now keep in mind that arm skin
is different than eye skin so things are
gonna be slightly different on the arm
than they are on the eyes but it'll give
you an idea with a finger swatch and a
brush wash what we're dealing with here
anymore
hey now you've seen the palette on its
own so now let's check out the
comparison of some of the shades here in
the mega pro 3 with some of the other
lorac palettes that I have so when I
first got this the first thing I thought
of was that I already had rose quartz in
the lorac metal Pro palette but it's not
the same I'm gonna go ahead and swatch
them both for you so there is from the
metals and then there is from the mega
pro 3 well was I had a frame there so
you can see that the mega pro 3 one is
definitely a little more pink now
looking at the original mega Pro there
are quite a few that are similar but
they're not the same but it'll give you
an idea if you own the original mega Pro
some shades that are similar in the
three so the first one is cream here and
we're gonna compare that to pink cream
here so first is going to be cream you
can see there you go so here's cream and
then here's pink cream and they look
pretty much the same I mean there's a
tad bit more pink and pink cream but
they could be used for the same purpose
next up is taupe and walnut
so here's taupe and walnut from the mega
pro 3 okay now we're gonna look at mall
and violet grey violet gray is just a
little bit deeper but they're in the
same family okay next we're gonna look
at sable and then bark so this is sable
and bark so that's from the three that's
from the original Pro okay you'll find
black in most of the lorac Pro palette
so black and jet black and there's the
blacks and all of them they're the same
and it's pretty much the same as jet
black
so here's jet black alright black jet
black from the pro three mega pro three
okay the last one I wanted to show you
was slate here and then deep fog
here here's slate and deep fog so you
can see if you already have the original
Pro there's a lot of very similar shades
now looking at the lorac pro 2 there's
only one shade and it is exactly the
same and it's the shade snow so this is
the snow from the pro 2 and then this is
the snow from the mega pro 3 and you can
see they're the same okay now we're
going to look at the original mega Pro
palette like we mentioned in the
original lorac Pro palette the cream and
the black match up kind of with pink
cream and jet black so they're the exact
same shades I'm not gonna swatch them
again okay but we are going to look at
indigo this is a very interesting shade
it has lots of purple and blue glitter
in the background and we're gonna
compare that to liquorice they are
different but I just wanted to show you
them next to each other unfortunately I
do like me I do like the one from the
original mega Pro better than the mega
Pro 3 it's got a lot more glitter in the
backgrounds I don't remember if there's
fallout or not I haven't used it in a
long time but you can see there is it's
got the same kind of idea but it's not
as dazzling and the three as it is in
the original okay now we're gonna swatch
granite here and dark roast here so
granite has a little more sparkle we're
dark roast has a little more shine then
we have maroon here and Sequoia here
here's maroon and here's Sequoia very
very similar there's a tad bit more of a
reddish tone to this one where this
one's a little bit more peachy ish in
the undertone but this one's a little
more pink in red and then finally
looking at the mega pro 2 chiffon right
here is very similar to pink cream but
chiffon has a little bit of shimmer just
a very very tiny bit though so you I
mean you can barely see it it's kind of
a shimmery version of pink cream then of
course we have black and jet black but
other than that there's no other dupes
in this one we
the mega pro 3 alright last piece of
this very comprehensive video is my
personal opinion on this palette so this
is the way that I'm thinking if you've
ever tried lorac shadows before and you
know you either love them or hate them
your opinion is going to be the same of
this it is the traditional lorac Pro
formula
it's very powdery very easy to work with
very pigmented and it's a really in my
opinion nice formula if you can get past
that powdery messiness if you're okay
with that
I think lorac made a really bad decision
with this white packaging I just it's
gross it's it's just straight-up bruised
and and I'm gonna try and do my best to
clean it off because it's made out of
cardboard there's only so much you can
do to clean it off so with the color
selection you have to ask yourself do
you love these nude looking shades do
you like that nude look do you like
doing um do you like a little variety in
your nude look this will give you some
variety it will give you the Pink's the
peaches the bronzes things like that but
it doesn't really take you much further
than that and that's kind of my big
complaint about the color selection is
it me personally being extremely
experimental that is not a word someone
that likes to experiment with different
colors of eyeshadow I get bored with
this very quickly I like to be able to
mix up adding in some colors and
different things so I get bored with it
but if you're just getting started with
eyeshadow and you're looking for
different ways to vary up a neutral
natural look you're going for it go for
it this is gonna be great for you my big
complaint here I'm really sad about this
pomegranate shade I think it's a really
weird inclusion into this palette this
pomegranate shade it's like you know let
me put the hardest color to work with in
this very easy to work with palette I
don't get that I wish that they have put
maybe like a more bold green
more bold olive green or a more bold
purple you know it's maybe even taking
this eggplant up to a lighter shimmery
or eggplant he kind of color that would
have been really cool because then you
could have set it off with these matte
purpley kinds of shades they've got
these beautiful matte purple things but
then there's no purpley shimmers to go
with them
they're all browns and olives and it I
mean the olive looks cool with the
purple but I don't know this palm grant
is just completely out of place I don't
get that one at all but I can definitely
see this being used for many skin tones
I can't imagine any skin tone that would
not enjoy this maybe if you're super
cool and you don't like warm looks at
all maybe you might be a little
disappointed in this but even someone
with a cooler skin tone I think can work
with this overall I mean it's a really
nice palette but like I said for me I
can see myself getting bored with it
relatively quickly but for most people I
would imagine this would be a really fun
palette to play with and kind of take
you a little bit out of your comfort
zone if you're only used to doing like
one basic natural eye shadow look and
you want to try some some apricots and
some well Bellini is more of like a
peach shade or you know this rust or
rose quartz things like that and it's
kind of fun to play with just those
shades if you're not used to using a
bunch of bold colors so overall it's a
definite recommend they last a really
long time on the eyes I've used them
with a primer without a primer with a
primer they do last a bit longer but
it's really not 100% necessary they're
gonna last great even without a primer
I mean it's just a fantastic palette and
I don't I mean I really like it I do I
really really like it a lot so hopefully
that gave you some good information so
that you can decide whether the lorac
mega pro 3 is right for you if you did
find it helpful and you think that
someone else you know might find it
helpful definitely feel free to share
