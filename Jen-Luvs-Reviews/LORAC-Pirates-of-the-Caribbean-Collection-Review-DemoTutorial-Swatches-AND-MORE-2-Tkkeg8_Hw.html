the pirates of the caribbean dead men
tell no tales collection by lo rock I
have so much information to share with
you about not only the eyeshadow palette
but the cheek palette and one of the lip
glosses so stay tuned for all the pirate
goodness coming up right now
so as you may know Disney collaborated
with lorac on this makeup collection and
I was fortunate enough to be able to
purchase these three products in the
collection thanks to the wonderful
ladies over in the super chat so I want
to everyone so I get a gentleman but
mostly its ladies over there so ladies
thank you so much for your donation that
enabled me to buy these products if
you've never been to one of my review
videos before they're very very long
think of them as like a non-fiction book
that you don't necessarily have to read
every single chapter so I will be
putting timestamps down below if there's
certain things that you'd rather see and
there's certain sections that you want
to skip if you find yourself kind of
spacing out during one part or another
just get to the next section I'm sure
there's something right in there for you
so where we're going to start is
information about lorac as a brand so
lorac says that they are a cruelty free
company they're very passionate about
that there is a reputable blog called
cruelty free kitty and they did a little
bit of digging and found out that lorac
cannot guarantee the suppliers of their
suppliers or the raw materials of the
products they cannot guarantee that
those are cruelty free so depending on
your level of cruelty free you may say
lorac is cruelty free or is not cruelty
free these products are paraben free
they are not vegan however every single
one of these products in one way or
another said that it may or may not
include carmine which is made from
crushed beetles it is a red pigment so
some of the shadows and blushes may have
it some of them may not do the lip
products may have it some may not the
only way to find out which ones have it
is to contact the ROC directly because
it just says may or may not on the
ingredient deck it doesn't specify which
products go along with the whole
cruelty-free thing the product is
assembled in the United States but it is
made up of ingredients from both us and
non-us sources it's a non US sources
that I guess that they can't guarantee
that the suppliers of the suppliers are
cruelty free so now let's go ahead and
talk about price and
values so with the eyeshadow palette
you're paying $52 for this the blush
palette is $30 and the lip products are
$26 each you do get two lip products in
here you get a lipstick and a lip gloss
they are not full-size but they're not
too terribly far from full size you can
currently purchase these items at Ulta
the rocks website Kohl's and HSN a
little extra bonus for HSN they do offer
it in four payments they also have free
shipping and they also offer the lip
products in duo's that'll save you about
10 bucks if you were going to buy two of
the lip products versus buying them
together the eyeshadow palette and you
when you open it up you see that it's
got this cardboard packaging got a very
nice mirror here it's also got a little
door here and every time I watch review
of this I'm like crossing my fingers
please figure it out please figure out
with the doors for and like 75% of the
time they have no idea what the doors
for the little door is to put the blush
palette in so what you can do is go like
this and put it in and I have to admit
when I first unbox this on the channel
people had to tell me what the door is
for so I don't followed anybody for not
knowing but that is what the little
doors for is the hold the blush palette
but you do have to buy the blush palette
separately so if you don't buy the blush
palette I don't know what you would use
this door for but I think it's super
cute you also get a little eyeliner that
I really want to tell you something
about but we're going to hold off on
that until we get to a greedy of
analysis comes with 18 shadows they are
0.7 grams each it's really nice to have
an eyeshadow that's at least 1 gram
these are small size shadows lorac
always tends to make small size shadows
when they're the square pan honest alia
makes a similar size pan and their
palettes but most palettes do have
larger pans you are getting 18 shades in
here so it's 12 point 6 grams total
equaling to 4 dollars and 13 cents per
gram of products which is relatively
expensive for this kind of price range
when we're talking about comparing it to
Too Faced and Urban Decay and honest
alia and you know brands like that auto
Savia is more expensive than this
program but it this is more expensive
than the Urban Decay's and the Too Faced
and things like that it's not the best
bang for your buck as far as the amount
of product that you get compared to
other lorac products the lorac Pro
palette is $5 per gray on the unzipped
oldest $3.75 per gram and the California
Dreaming palette is only three dollars
in 9 cents program which is inching
toward urban decay territory so in the
in the lorac world this is not a
fabulous value but it's not the most
expensive product program that they sell
now let's talk about the blush palette
in contrast this is a fantastic deal for
price per gram it's a $30 palette you
get 15.4 2 grams of product that equals
out to a dollar 95 per gram of product
which is really inexpensive in
comparison with that the Sephora contour
blush palette is six dollars and forty
nine cents per gram the Urban Decay
jean-michel basquiat OC I said that
right my French is awful eight dollars
per gram and the Becca and Chrissy
Teigen palette which is also really
popular right now that's three dollars
and seven cents per gram so this is a
fabulous value for your money you do get
six shades these four here have shimmer
in them none of them have glitter in
them and these two shades here are matte
the lip product okay when I first saw
the price point on this at $26 I thought
that was outrageous I put that on that
was like right like that's insane but I
saw the iridescent in here and like well
you know I mean there really doesn't
look like there's a lot of lipstick in
here when you think about you know it's
a traditional size lipstick it doesn't
seem like an awful lot of product they
don't separate out the ounces per
product they just do for the entire
thing so this here is 0.18 ounces which
equals 144 dollars per ounce of product
of either/or together the alter-ego
matte lipsticks by themselves are $18
for a point one two ounces that's one
hundred and fifty dollars per ounce and
then the alter ego lip glosses
are $17 for 0.1 three ounces and that's
a hundred and thirty one dollars per
ounce so when you even them out it ends
up being kind of in the middle so are
you being ripped off for lorac standards
no you're not being ripped off it's
about the right price considering the
price of their other lip products
so I comparing it also to some other lip
products on the market for example the
MAC lipsticks are $170 an ounce and the
bite Beauty amuse-bouche lipsticks are
170
three dollars per ounce so those are for
the lipstick so this is less expensive
when you look at lip glosses the buxom
full-on lip creams are 142 dollars an
ounce and then the anasazi about details
lip gloss those are only $100 an ounce
that's actually a really really good
deal in comparison with all the other
things so again it's kind of
middle-of-the-road as far as value those
I got a very enthusiastic request to
move the ingredient analysis down
further into my videos so right now
instead of doing greedy analysis we're
going to go ahead and do swatches and
demo so here comes the swatches right
now welcome to the swatches of the
Pirates of the Caribbean
dead men tell no tales palette so we're
going to start with ghostly starry night
compass end so first what I want to
sorry about the a Defoe because it'll
come right back
sorry Knight is the first one I want to
tell you about it definitely needs a
little bit of building on the lid but I
find that it blends nicely into the
other shadows and I do really like the
shade a lot if you're willing to kind of
build it up and kind of go back and
forth
ghostly I feel like doesn't swatch here
as nicely as it does on the lid but it's
definitely not the most opaque white
I've ever seen also same thing with
compass I feel like compass is much more
beautiful on the lid than it is here in
the swatch it might be due to my skin
tone and argh is just okay for me it's
definitely not my favorite shade it's
relatively ordinary on the skin now this
is the white test the purpose of this is
to show what happens when you over blend
the shadows and what may happen over
time and as you can see starry night in
argh are the ones that hang on the
longest going into the second set of
four we have Black Pearl yo-ho-ho
bones and Silver Mist so with black
pearl black pearl is one of those
duochrome
shift shades kind of appeal and warm
brown shade it's really fun I really
like shades like this yo-ho-ho and bones
are just kind of okay in the swatch
bones is a nice transition shade for my
skin tone or a lighter it probably won't
work very well on other skin tone Silver
Mist is a gorgeous shade I really really
like it
my favorite ones here are black pearl
and silver mess the other ones are just
kind of okay for me
and with the white test you can see that
black pearls definitely hangs on the
longest the rest of them kind of wipe
away now moving on to treasure tell no
tales shiver me and curse treasure is
definitely my favorite
out of these four but tell no tales is
also a really wonderful matte shade so
treasure you can see that swatches
beautifully as does tell no tales shiver
me is kind of weak but curse is really
interesting you see how to Sparkle still
hang on even in the brush watch a lot of
times in a brush watch the sparkles will
just be completely gone but they
definitely hang on here I find when you
blend it out on the eye they don't hang
out but if you pack it on the lid they
will and with the white test they all
hang out except for shiver me now down
to matey
lost at sea pirates chest and sea haze
or mattie mattie I do really like matey
or mattie it's a very nice matte white I
like it better than ghostly I also
really like lost at sea and pirates
chest and see haze this is actually a
really nice trio of lighter shades they
just work really well loss at sea is
probably the weakest out of these four
but see haze is just gorgeous I love the
shade I'm very much attracted to shades
like this I just think it's absolutely
beautiful it reminds me of a mermaid you
can see that yellow green ship there
it's just really beautiful and the white
test you can see that pirates chests and
sea caves are the only ones that hang
around but though it's pretty good for
lighter shades medicine silent mary are
our last one menace is like a deep green
gray and that one is a really nice matte
shade a little bit patchy there on the
swatch but it's not so bad and silent
mary i really like a lot as well i don't
feel like it looks as good on the lid
though as it does in the swatch here but
it is still overly my shade great shade
to use to balance out some of these
brighter colors and with the white test
you can see that both of them left
pretty sync and well now moving on to
the blush palette as you can see you've
got your three highlights on the left
and your three blushes on the right so
going with the highlights first i just
really
we shaved so much so much the only one
I'm not really digging is fortune
because it's just too light but they
pick up beautifully on the brush they do
kick up a ton of powder though a lot of
powder but the shine is really really
beautiful if you like those really poppy
from space highlighters these are not
subtle highlighters at all if you're
really if you really love like the becca
highlights you will probably really
really like these going down to the
bottom you kind of got a blush highlight
mix here with bold spirit but it's
really really gorgeous you can use it
kind of as a blush topper especially if
you're a deeper skin tone you're
probably me that blush underneath it to
make it pop but it's absolutely gorgeous
and Caribbean is a beautiful beautiful
shade lasting power is fantastic and
Lost Boy is also a really nice shape for
lighter skin tones I hope you found this
watch is helpful now I'm going to go
ahead and show you a demo of how I got
this look today let me I want to tell
you about the demo before you watch as I
will not be using the eyeliner and
there's a good reason for that but I'll
save that for ingredient analysis so go
ahead and check out the demo now and I
will see you in just a minute
taking my yard
hello
Oh
Hingham a occurred
why
and
thank God
Hey so now it is time for my favorite
part because I'm such a geek for
ingredient analysis this is just a
reminder that I am NOT a makeup artist
and I am NOT a cosmetic chemist I am a
makeup enthusiast and I'm a makeup geek
self-proclaimed I love looking up
ingredients and learning information and
every time I look up information about
ingredients I learn more and more I also
learn a lot from you in the comments
those of you that leave comments about
the ingredients and I love learning from
you so just keep that in mind as you
watch the demo and also to include an
analysis so let's go ahead and talk
about the eyeshadow palettes and things
that you need to know mica and talc are
both in here some people like one or the
other or some people don't like one more
than the others so just so you know it
has both mica is further up on the
ingredient list than calc it all says at
Paxil palmitate some people don't like
palm oil and palm oil derived products
so that's something that's in here
mineral oil I personally don't have a
problem with but some people do so that
is in here as well also fxo palmitate
does have an allergen concern on there
for people that are allergic to it so
there you go
propylene glycol also has an allergen
concern on it it also says that it may
or may not contain a bunch of pigments
like ferric ferrocyanide that are not
let's say so I would not use any of
these shadows on your lips move will ask
me why would I put it on my lips well
some powder products look very nice on
the lips you can take like one of these
shimmery shades and add a little bit of
shimmer to your lips but I do not
recommend you do that with this palette
just because it's not lips safe like I
mentioned when I talked about this not
being vegan it does have carmine and
some of these shadows so just so you
know that is in here for those you do
not like to crush beetles in your
eyeshadows some other interesting
ingredients that I found that I never
noticed before when I looked at lorac
eyeshadows is it actually has a lot of
skin conditioning extracts in there and
I'd read about that in Allah rocks about
pages I thought was really cool so for
example he about cucumber extract
parsley extract marshmallow root extract
which is very interesting to look up if
you want to read about marshmallow root
I don't know I found it fascinating
coring flower extract I'm a geek I can't
help it English marigold flower extract
and then lemon peel extract so all of
them except of the lemon peel extract
are claimed to be skin conditioning I
don't know how
getting conditioning something can be in
a powder form but just so you know
that's the thing the lemon peel extract
I'm not quite sure why that's in there I
didn't see any reason why it would be in
a cosmetic product but polished choice
does say that it is skin sensitizing so
that's not necessarily a good thing but
Live Strong has a list of the benefits
of lemon peel extract so I don't know
what to believe on that one I'll leave
links down below so you can make your
own decisions all of the ingredients I
talked about in the eyeshadow palette
are also in the blush palette but also
in addition to that this something
called retinol palmitate which is a form
of vitamin A there's some evidence that
increases Sun sensitivity I'm not sure
how much it would in a blush palette but
just so you know I'm just letting you
know it's in there and it does seem to
be lip safe I forgot to mention the
highlighter this is a Little Rock from
the line Pro pencil edited in the black
shade now it does have cyclopentyl
siloxane if you want to decrease your
environmental footprint you can wipe
this off instead of washing it off and
letting it go into the sink it has been
shown to be bioaccumulative in sea life
so just so you know that's a bang
everything looks good to you this is the
black pigment and that's called CI 77266
I looked at Environmental Working Group
org they can be kind of how do I say
this in a nice way they can really kind
of alarm people for no reason sometimes
it seems because the more I dig into
research about different products I find
that all the sources will say well
Environmental Working Group says this
but when you really look at the research
it really only had to do with this
specific circumstance and that certainly
happened in the natural environment so
it's not that big of a deal you know I'm
saying so it seems like the concerns are
almost overinflated on Environmental
Working Group so it's a great place for
me to start ingredient analysis but it's
never where I stopped my ingredient
alysus so keep that in mind as I tell
you this environmental working group org
says that is a violation of government
restrictions to use that product on
cosmetics that are by the eyes in Canada
they say it is expected to be toxic or
harmful or because of organ system
toxicity non-reproductive type
immediately after I found that right
before I film this video because
adjusted the ingredient alysus this
morning I emailed the rock to find out
what they had to say about it I also
looked on Sephora to see if I could find
that ingredient in any other product and
I did find it I found it in the Urban
Decay 24/7 eyeliner in perversion I also
found it in the Marc Jacobs pen liner so
obviously somebody seems to say this is
okay because now I found three brands
that use this pigment so this may be a
cause for alarm it may not be a cause
for alarm
I don't know I'm personally not going to
use this because of that until I hear
from lorac or I find some other source
telling me that this product is okay
it's just not worth it to me any update
I get from lorac about the eyeliner I'll
put in the description below where the
lip product won't be too alarming just a
couple of allergen concerns in the
lipstick at the hexyl palmitate
tocopherol acetate and phenoxyethanol
and then in the lip gloss the
phenoxyethanol those are just all
allergen concerns so if you're sensitive
to any of those ingredients you want to
skip this so now let's go into my full
review of the product starting with the
eye shadow palette so I don't think this
eyeshadow palette is going to be for
everyone if you are a beginner at makeup
and you're not quite sure how to put
colors together I definitely wouldn't
recommend this just because it's not an
intuitive setup there's there's no real
guide for how to set the how to put on
your look for example the lorac Pro
palette the Tarte Pro palette those are
set up so that you know they go from
light to dark it's just a lot easier to
figure out what to do with what this one
I feel like it's kind of all over the
place in the color selection so I don't
know if that would be best for beginners
but if you are used to using eyeshadow
and you're used to playing with colors
then you will probably be justifying
with this I personally don't have too
much of a trouble figuring out what I
want to do with it but I do have to put
some thought into it I have found though
that these shades go really well
together there really aren't any shades
that I feel like don't go well together
that I can't pull off a look with you
know like today I use these two shades
here but I could have easily done the
green and the bright blue or the blue
and the gold or the
red and the gold and you've got all
these other shades in here that you can
kind of mix with it to kind of either
deepen up the look lighten up the look
you do have a very nice blue brown shade
in this black pearl it's more of like a
teal Brown which I really really like
those shades I also really like compass
this gold here is beautiful starry night
is gorgeous my favorite shade in here is
CA just because I don't own anything
like it I think this was a great way for
lorac to break away from their typical
neutral looking eyeshadow palette I do
wish it was set up a little bit easier
but I really like the color selection I
think that it's fun I love it there's a
mix of tone in here there's some light
shades in here there's some mid tone
shade there's some deep shade so I feel
like this works for anybody of any skin
tone and it felt comfortable with these
kinds of colors are you gonna be able to
pull off a completely neutral look
probably but there isn't a lot of
versatility for a neutral look in this
palette overall I really really enjoy
the quality the quality is amazing the
lasting power on the shadows with a
primer is fantastic without a primer it
seems to fade a little bit faster but
with a primer it's amazing I haven't
used these wet yet but supposedly you
can use them wet which is very exciting
it's just a really fun palette to play
with so I personally really love it and
I definitely recommend it if you've
watched any reviews of the blush palette
they've all been positive at least the
ones that I've seen and my review is
going to be no different this is a
phenomenal blush palette like I've
talked about in the value section this
is a great deal at less than $2 per gram
of product the color selection is
beautiful if you have a very deep skin
tone there may be a couple of shades
that you kind of like and don't really
know what to do with these but I really
think that this is going to show up on a
deeper skin tone the pigmentation can
really be built up to being very very
bright so I think you're really going to
be able to use it I'm not sure about
this one over here whether you'll be
able to use this with a very deep skin
tone but I do feel like people with very
fair skin tones are going to be able to
rock everything here just going to have
to have a really light hand with this
blush if you are of a very light skin
tone I love this shade right here it
kind of reminds me of some becca
products and that it's got that shimmer
and shine to it but it's not like super
bold and
I've used this multiple times as just a
blush but you can also use this as kind
of a blush topper kind of like a colored
highlighter kind of situation it's
really beautiful these highlights as
well are very very beautiful I don't
particularly like the white as much on
me because I feel it kind of glows white
it's just a little too white if you're
very fair you probably will be able to
get away with that easier than I can but
remember you can also use these for
eyeshadows as well so don't feel like
you're limited in using these as just
blushes these are make beautiful
beautiful eye shadows as well so this is
definitely a huge recommend this is my
favorite thing in the collection one of
my favorite things that I've bought in a
very long time I can't stop using this I
love it
now the lip product I got the shade
sparrow and I'll show you the picture
that's on the website this is what I
thought I was getting but if you look
very very closely at the bottom
underneath that picture there is a
picture of the swatch and you can see
the swatch is totally different from the
lipstick that they show and the lipstick
is actually much closer to the swatch
this lipstick I feel is a little grey I
feel like I can kind of pull it off with
this look but it's really not my
favorite shade I wish they was closer to
the lipstick color that they showed in
the picture rather than it being so
brave expecting more of a warm tone and
this is very very cool I do like the
lipstick with the lip gloss over top of
it but I don't think I'll be wearing the
lipstick all by itself I do however
really like the lip gloss by itself I am
really enjoying it I think it's
absolutely beautiful
you saw on the application process the
lip gloss by itself and I really liked
it and I tried it over a few different
lipsticks it's very fun to play with and
I really really enjoy it is it worth the
money I don't know I guess it just
depends on what you feel like you want
to spend on a lip product it's kind of
like if somebody says oh I'm going to
charge you $30 for this bowl of ice
cream or it no matter what is in that
ice cream are you going to buy a $30
bowl of ice cream
some people may if it's got good enough
ingredients in it some people might buy
a $30 bowl of ice cream me personally
I'm gonna sit there and be like no it's
just ice cream I'm not paying $30 for it
that's kind of the
I feel about expensive lip products it's
just any any kind of goes over $20 $22 I
start point hey but everyone has their
own threshold of what's expensive to
them if this looks like something you
may enjoy and that $26 doesn't make you
go then you might want to try them I
only tried this one just because of the
price points but I am really enjoying it
the lip gloss is not sticky at all the
lipstick is very creamy very hydrating
goes on very nicely and I enjoy the
products overall I only complain as the
shade on sparrow on the lipstick but
other than that I'm really really liking
it a lot I don't think I'm gonna buy any
more but if I found these lip glosses by
themselves with the with the iridescent
in them I might buy more of those that
would be something I would consider so
