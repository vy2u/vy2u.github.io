so excited to try it out so this is my
first experience with it I just went
right in with my domed crease brush I
love this brush went in with light brown
and just windshield wiper motions back
and forth in that crease I love this
shape brush because it's got that point
it's nice and dense it's not too fluffy
and it's kind of short so that really
makes it you know I'm able to really
pack that color in next up going in with
the beige color and you can see it's
kind of skipping over my fine lines
there those are wrinkles girlfriend
those are wrinkles but we'll blend those
in later no big deal but look at the
pigmentation they're just absolutely
gorgeous with that flat shader brush now
going in with a fluffy brush just a
clean fluffy brush been blending it out
so that those fine lines whip some hair
there let's get that out of the way so
just making sure that those two colors
are nice and blended together a nice
bright look there so now we're going to
make it a little brighter by adding a
little bit of blue into the crease and I
think that you know adding blue then the
most important thing I've learned about
adding blue is just doing it with some
neutrals so that it's not too loud that
makes a little more wearable so I'm just
kind of putting that into the outer half
of my crease and then just bringing out
onto the brow bone just a little bit I
noticed on the one side I brought it in
a little too much so I'm just bringing
it in a little further on the other side
just to make sure that it matches I
always have to go back and forth with
that Jenna I'm going in with chrome this
is just a beautiful just metallic color
and I just kind of darkening that outer
corner I noticed this has more Brown nuh
than I expected but you know it works I
think darkening it out I'm just kind of
making that outer corner darker so that
the inner corner pops a little more so
now I'm blend blend
and I'm blending up just that dark blue
making sure that's nice and blended
making sure that chrome is blended in
with the beige blend blend blend blend
blend blend in it all out because we
definitely don't want to look like a
clown and blending is the key to not
looking like that and getting those
colors to look seamless going in with
the brow bone color which is buff for me
and I just really making sure that
that's blended in because that can look
kind of ridiculous if you don't blend it
so you just gotta take that brush it's
that same dome brush now just going in
with some lower on my lower lash line
back with that Navy I'm just doing it on
that outer one third of my eye I don't
like it all the way across I feel like
it's too loud for me I don't enjoy that
I don't feel like it's as wearable when
it goes all the way across so I'm just
doing the outer one third with that same
flat shader brush that's an Ecotools
brush from their kit now that's it for
the eyeshadow look going in with the
amazing Maybelline master precise liner
now I am used to using this without
having to hold a mirror so this was
really tricky for me to do this
one-handed I usually kind of pull my I
taught with the one hand and then draw
with my other hand so this was very
challenging 22 on camera in this
particular instance so you can see I'm
just having a little bit of trouble but
it's working out got that little wing
flip it flip a and this side works out
pretty good I do have a little bit of
trouble with the other side that you'll
see in a minute so initially it's going
on pretty well I'm standing really close
to that lash line starting in the middle
working my way out trying to do that
wing not doing too well so I decided to
go into the inner corner and just make
that really really thin in the inner
corner kind of trying to bring that wing
out but it kept getting stuck on my my
skin that's not very taut on my eye
anymore and it just kept getting stuck
in it which wasn't drawing the way I
wanted it to so I just went over my
mirror I broke down and just did it with
two hands the way that I normally do so
I'm sorry that you can't see exactly
what I'm doing but you saw it on the
right side so it was the same thing on
the left side I'm hope you forgive me
all right I forgot one more thing so I
looked again and I saw that that chrome
was just a little too nude for my liking
i really
my eyes the pop and that contrast
between the blue and my lid color so I
added some silver over top of that
chrome because it just wasn't the way
that I wanted it to look now I am very
happy with the look much much better
going in with my sample size of the
better than sex mascara this is the
second time that I've used it and it's a
pretty nice mascara separates my lashes
pretty well doesn't clump them together
no flaking during the day just kind of a
nice mascara but not super volumizing
for me not super lengthening but you
know it's nice I definitely wouldn't
invest in a full size at this point but
I'm still testing it you know this is
only the second time I've used it oops
got a little up there whoops didn't mean
to do that yikes anything can happen
when I'm trying to do my makeup on
camera and you can see that it's curling
my lashes actually really nicely
but still not my favorite mascara as I
go into the second coat just not seeing
a huge difference I mean it's a nice
mascara I'm not going to complain about
it but I'm not going to rave about it
either at least so far so this is the
finished look my eyebrows a little wonky
there oops but that's okay you'll
forgive me but that's that's kind of how
that came out and I hope you enjoyed
this little tutorial / getting ready
with me look you know and if you have
any questions about how I did things
what kind of brushes I use feel free to
leave those questions down below thank
