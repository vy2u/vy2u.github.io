a couple of new drugstore brow products
that just came out not too terribly long
ago I've had these for a few weeks now I
like to wait I'd rather not be first but
have a really good review for you of my
opinion so it takes me a little while to
try things make sure I've got a good
solid opinion before I film these videos
so I am comparing today the Loreal brow
stylist definer and the bread little bit
of that the Maybelline brow drama pomade
crayon now I'll start with the L'Oreal
when I got this and try this I was like
oh my gosh this is exactly like my brow
is it is exactly like my brow is let me
get my brow is okay this is the
Anastasia brow Wiz in the shade dark
brown this is the Loreal brow stylist
definer in the shade dark brunette and
I'm going to swatch those for you very
quickly and show you now let me tell you
if you weren't unaware the brow Wiz is
$20 the L'Oreal is 10 and these are both
equally as creamy and actually I feel
like the L'Oreal is just a little bit
creamier but and creamy isn't
necessarily a good thing in brow
products in that you don't want it to
make your brows mush and together and
kind of stick together but I don't feel
like that happens with either of these
products as far as making your brows
mush and feel terrible but this is the
dark brown for the L'Oreal this is dark
brunette and then this is the dark brown
for the honest osseous you can see the
color difference the L'Oreal definitely
makes my eyes eyebrows look a lot
blacker than the honest dogs yeah now
with these two I would compare them in
formula I feel like the formula is very
very similar I don't think you need a
brow Wiz if you have one of these I
genuinely don't the lasting power is the
same the tips are the same the
pigmentation is the same the only thing
is if you don't like the shade
the shade doesn't match you you're gonna
have to kind of play with that I seen
swatches of the other L'Oreal shades and
I feel like the shades are a little more
on point with the Anastasia but as far
as the formula goes this formula is just
as good just as good I wouldn't say it's
better but it's just as good the other
thing is they both have spoolie is on
the end which i think is fair but let's
look at the spool ease I've had the
Anastasio a bit longer so you can see
it's a little dirtier but I mean they're
they're spool ease they do the same
thing so they're I think the the
bristles on the Anastasi I went are
slightly closer together but they do the
same thing of things anything but I what
I wanted to show you for the most part
what I really want to show you was this
by Maybelline the brow drama pomade
crayon and I'm gonna compare that as
well okay and as you can see I can't
make a thin line with the brow crayon I
just can't it's not possible to make a
thin line like that because this thing
is huge and ginormous that was the big
fail on Maybelline's part was making
this so stinkin big I wish they had
stretched it out and made it thinner now
you can see that the shade is pretty
much exactly the same as the are
Nastasia it is exactly the same it's
exactly the same as the Anastasio dark
brown so if you like the on estancia
dark brown then this is great now this
is what the deal is with this if you
have very thin brows this is going to be
harder to work with but here's the good
news
you can easily wipe off any excess it
comes off super easy so let me show you
I'm gonna mess up and I'm gonna show you
how easy it is to fix it so let's say
I'm putting on my brows and I go like
this oops I messed up okay watch god
super super easy to undo so if you
accidentally go too far it's not a big
deal to wipe that off and just keep it
where you want it let's talk about price
and value here okay this is where it
gets interesting so the L'Oreal is ten
dollars the Maybelline is ten dollars
this L'Oreal has point zero zero three
ounces it's the same as the brows okay
the Maybelline has
point zero four ounces that's over 13
times the amount of product as is in the
Loreal or the honest audio 13 times
that's a hundred and thirty dollars
worth of these we're a little more
actually I mean at that point if you
think about it that way I'm going with
this one considering it performs pretty
much the same way the only thing is is
like couldn't have made it just this
long like twice as long and twice as
thin like oh they're killing me on that
because I feel like that's the biggest
downfall but you know if you can deal
with the fact that it's huge it is so
much more worth it especially if you're
on a budget and you're not trying to
spend like a lot of money on brow
products and you want something that's
really good definitely recommend this
one you just have to you know you just
have to work with it a little bit as far
as the application goes but it's amazing
it's a wonderful wonderful wonderful
product so thank you so much for
