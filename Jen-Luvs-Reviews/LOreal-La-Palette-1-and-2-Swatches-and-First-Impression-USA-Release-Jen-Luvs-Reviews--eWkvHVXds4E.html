the new L'Oreal love palettes so excited
about these I went to the drugstore I
went to Walmart today and they went
drugstore palette crazy I've got these
three palettes from hard candy the
natural eye the smoky eye and the sassy
eye this review is already up I also got
the blush nudes palette from Maybelline
this review is already up and then this
one is the third in the series so just
look for this shirt in my selection of
video of course I just got them today so
I haven't had a chance to wear them on
my eyes yet but I am going to be doing a
video in a couple of weeks kind of
talking about all of these palettes
finding dupes in my high-end collection
showing you looks that I've created a
you know over the past couple weeks
which is going to be in the next couple
of weeks I'm going to be putting
pictures on my Instagram and my Twitter
and keep up with their I will put those
links down below in case you're curious
about that
but what I know what you're really
curious about because you're here is
these palettes so I'm gonna shut up
about what's coming and tell you about
what's now so the first one I'm going to
talk about is Lilla palette nude one it
comes with ten shades and let's go ahead
and talk about size the total weight of
this palette is seventeen point five
grams and that is a huge weight for a
palette 12 times 1.3 equals so 15.6
grams total in The Naked and seventeen
point five grams in the L'Oreal lafalot
one so you're getting actually more
product in the l'oreal than you do in
the urban decay just so ya know pretty
amazing there okay also with this
palette you are going to get this very
long brushy kind of thing this is the
way it comes packaged okay so this is
the tool that it comes with it's got a
sponge tip here and then a brush here
and I'll show you what that brush looks
like as far as the bendiness of it it
isn't very dense it's not very dense as
you can see but I have a feeling that's
gonna do the job okay but a lot of
people swear by these sponge applicators
man don't just throw those sponge
applicators out because there are people
that can create some beautiful local
sponge applicators alright so let's go
ahead and swatch the
talent nude one so you can see what
these shades are like and I can tell you
there is a nice mix of satin ease
shimmer ease and mats in here okay this
one is a little bit crumbly to swatch
I'll tell you that right now
that was the crumbly one and you can see
it crumble okay all of these next ones
are buttery and amazing I mean really
drugstore relink okay
only one crumbled under my swatch and
that was this one
the rest are extremely creamy and
amazing I'm gonna hide my eyes back here
to make sure it's not focusing on my
eyes and you can actually see those
gorgeous swatches just absolutely
beautiful and I forgot to mention that
this palette is about $15 depending on
where you get I think mine was about
1450 at Walmart and from initial
swatches if you told me this was a
high-end palette I would totally believe
you totally believed you like no doubt
in my mind I will believe you I'm very
very excited about these shades
especially the ones that are a little
more shimmery this one here is
absolutely gorgeous I'm really excited
about these two matte shades I'm really
excited about this one here I mean just
just absolutely gorgeous
at buttery and creamy and I cannot wait
to play with this as you can see they're
mostly warm tones in here what you're
gonna see a contrast in the lip palette
too which I'm going to show you right
now this is the lapel it - and it's got
a lot of cool tones it actually kind of
reminds me a little bit of the Kat Von D
interstellar palette that I got not too
long ago as far as the color range I
don't know if you can kind of see I mean
I know they're not the same they're not
dupes but it's kind of similar in the
idea where you've got some purples and
some Browns this one of course has a lot
more Browns this one has some Gray's in
it but it kind of reminds me of a little
bit I don't know where y'all see in that
- or is it just me I don't know okay so
this one is going to be for people that
are wanting to try just a little bit
more color I'm going to go ahead and
swatch these for you now
these are all creamy no powdery I just
couldn't see what I'm doing here little
crumbly but that's because I'm pressing
so hard because I just like to press
into my swatches make sure I get it good
swatch okay again nothing crumbling here
just straight creamy alright so let's do
those last three shades these are the
purpley ones damn and even my high-end
when I swatch will give a little bit of
powder when i swatched them so this is
the shades these are I should say these
are the shades all together you can see
that some of them are a little more
shimmery than others just like the one
and it's really all about which tones
you prefer alright just for a little bit
of fun let's do a little dupe alert here
let's see if you can spot which one is a
Kat Von D interstellar eye shadow and
which one is from the L'Oreal look
palette
- okay so let's see if you can tell the
difference okay so got some swatch on my
arm oh alright it's almost like I feel
like on Sesame Street it was like which
one of these is not like the other let's
see if you can tell the high-end and
which one is the L'Oreal alright here we
go so go ahead and take a look at those
let me hide my eyeballs take a look at
those see what you think which one do
you think is Kat Von D which is some of
my favorite eyeshadows ever and which
one is the L'Oreal alright have you made
your choices okay L'Oreal Kat Von D and
her stellar L'Oreal Kat Von D
interstellar isn't that crazy
oh my goodness it's crazy like could you
tell the difference I mean honestly I
feel like as far as the issue I think
the L'Oreal is more pigmented I mean
even with both honestly with both I feel
like the L'Oreal is more pigmented now
the only thing about it being more
pigmented is that maybe it might be more
difficult to blend might be more
difficult to work with but we shall see
that's what I'm gonna be doing in the
next few days figuring that out
they're easy to blender now so when I
bought these I expected one to stand out
more than the other as being better or
worse than the other and honestly I feel
like the quality is there with both of
these pallets and again they remind me
of my high end shadows I feel like they
are performing swatch wise just as well
and I'm just very very impressed so
really it's going to be of what calls to
you the most if you're looking for a
more natural Brown neutral kind of look
you're gonna go with this I also feel
like these are really nice for more
mature eyes I feel like these are
there's enough mattes in here to mix
with your shimmers that you're gonna be
able to get a nice natural look that's
not going to give you that crepey
accentuated lid but you can use these
shimmers that kind of brighten up maybe
there's a very center of your lid
without putting it all over so that
you're not accentuating those fine lines
and wrinkles okay
so I feel like this one is going to be
great for that but I also feel like you
could be a younger person and really
enjoy the versatility of this palette I
think it's amazing and awesome and I'm
super excited about it now with this one
I feel like this is for more adventurous
people people that are looking for doing
a little bit of color but you can also
create some gorgeous neutral natural eye
shadows this one is a little more cool
tone than the other so if you prefer
cool tones maybe this one will be for
you there's enough Brown in here that
you can create a really nice natural
look without having the colors in it
don't be scared by the colors well
that's my review of the L'Oreal the
palettes I am very excited about them I
highly recommend them so far I am going
