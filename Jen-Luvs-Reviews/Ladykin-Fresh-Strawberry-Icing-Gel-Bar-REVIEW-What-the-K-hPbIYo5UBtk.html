the K where we discuss Korean beauty
products and whether they are worth your
time and money today we're going to be
talking about this thing this is a
strawberry moisturizer it's 90%
strawberry extract so let's talk about
this and whether you should be buying it
or not it is almost 11 o'clock at night
on Easter Sunday and I'm tired so I'm
hopefully hopefully exactly that's what
I'm saying I'm hopefully going to be
able to articulate myself well enough to
talk to you about this product I'm gonna
try so first of all first of all oh my
gosh Jen really first off I need to tell
you what this is called this is called
the fresh strawberry icing gel bar by
Lady Ken I did get this on Amazon it
cost $9.99 plus $2.99 shipping from Lady
Kim on Amazon you get six point seven
six fluid ounces in here so that leads
us to a little less than $2 per ounce
which is very inexpensive for a
moisturizer and we can talk about the
packaging for a second I personally
think it looks like a popsicle when my
husband looked at it he looked at me and
he said Jen what in the world are you
reviewing it's like it's a moisturizer
what else would it be I think it looks
like a pops cool
he thinks it looks like other things
what do you think it looks like leave a
comment below so ordered this on Amazon
on March 5th it was delivered on the 8th
so really really fast shipping I'm gonna
read you the description from Nene box
the best that I can they don't sell it
on me me box anymore but they did have a
nice description for it basically it's a
facial and body gel and it's supposed to
relax your redness on your face arms
legs or your whole body it's
moisturizing long lasting refreshes the
skin silky soft skin radiance boosting
elasticity it is a cooling treatment so
it's supposed to be good for sunburn
which I thought would be a great thing
to put in for now because we're starting
to get into those summer months in the
United States where people might be
fighting burns so I wanted to see
whether this would be good for that
it is a gel formula they say that
absorbs quickly that has natural
strawberry extract that is rich in
nutrients and improves the aging skin
they say that it's not sticky that it
relaxes the skin fast and helps to
prevent fine lines and wrinkles so
that's a lot of claims for one product
especially one such inexpensive man I
can't talk so that's a lot of claims for
something that was so inexpensive so of
course me being me I had to go through
the ingredients and once I go through
the ingredients and tell you a little
bit about what's in it we're gonna try
it on I'm gonna tell you how it feels I
have used it a few times before but I
want to give you like a fresh impressive
impression the first thing in here is it
does say that's 90% strawberry fruit
extract now I couldn't find any research
that said that strawberry fruit extract
was good for the skin I couldn't find
anything anywhere I did find an article
where it was mentioned it was actually
the cosmetic ingredient review which is
like a non-biased ingredient review like
they don't sell products or anything
they were actually doing product tests
on apple extracts for the skin and they
were trying to compare it to other fruit
extracts and they mentioned that there
wasn't any data on strawberry fruit
extract as far as the effects of it but
that was all I could find so really we
don't know whether 90 percent of this is
effective or not it could be it might be
it might not be the next thing after the
strawberry fruit extract is butylene
glycol there are some irritation
concerns with that ingredient and the
next ingredient is the big want-want of
this product it's alcohol and alcohol is
known to dry the skin which is really
really really not good so just knowing
the alcohol is the third ingredient in
this may make you want to say nope I
don't want this product but if it's not
making you say nope I don't want this
product hang in there because there are
some really good things in here so the
first one is sodium high alert which
there is a lot of research behind sodium
highly renee if you've ever heard of
hyaluronic acid sodium high Lauren eight
is a better form of hyaluronic acid it's
the salt form there's a lot of research
that sodium hi Lauren 8 is very good for
anti-aging effects the effects that have
been proven for it or smoother softer
skin decreased wrinkles and all-around
fuller appearance there's also an
ingredient called
Allen toen I think I said that right
that's a moisturizer that has a lot of
good research behind it also beta glucan
which is an antioxidant and panthenol
which attracts and holds moisture and
it's a soothing ingredient so those are
the fifth sixth seventh and eighth
ingredients in this so not super far
down but once you get into a certain
percentage of the product you can kind
of list them in any order so there's
really no way to know how much of those
good ingredients are in here we do know
that 90 percent of this product is the
the strawberry extract so I don't know
how much of that is actually in here it
may just be a completely negligible
amount now even further below that there
is a pH balancer I'm gonna try to
pronounce this try at the NOLA mine try
F n NOLA mine there we go it can be an
irritant to some people also
phenoxyethanol which can be an irritant
to some people and the very last
ingredient listed is fragrance which
some people are very anti fragrance so
based on what I just told you you may be
thinking one way or another but I do
want to try it on for you and let you
know how it feels and how it looks so it
comes out like this gel it looks a lot
like a clear aloe kind of gel and you
only need a little bit of it I usually
kind of rub it between my fingers and it
feels very wet it feels very water like
but a little bit more gel feeling than a
water now it still feels very very wet
and I can feel it cooling my skin very
very nicely I can also smell the
strawberry extremely strong strawberry
scent and it's an authentic strawberry
scent not an artificial candy scent it
smells like fresh picked strawberries it
smells to me absolutely amazing at this
point it's almost completely dry on my
face it feels a little bit tacky but not
sticky it just kind of feels like it's
drying down I feel the little wetter on
the outer edges of my face I feel like I
didn't rub it in as much and now it's
almost completely dry still feels a
little bit tacky let's give it another
second I'm not going to edit this so you
can see exactly how long it takes to
seep in and now it feels like it's
pretty much a completely gone off of my
skin I do
feel just a tad bit of stickiness on my
face but it's not and it's not annoying
it's not it doesn't feel heavy I can
just kind of feel a little bit of a film
on my face at this point I have to tell
you though after letting this seep into
my skin my skin really doesn't feel
hydrated it doesn't it took some people
hydrated at all it doesn't mean that
it's not hydrated it just doesn't feel
hydrated and I think that's due to the
gel consistency of it and I'm used to
more of a creamy you know lotion II kind
of face cream so I mean I don't know I
mean I guess is that's gonna come down
to personal preference whether you like
that or not I personally prefer a little
bit more of a hydrated feeling to my
face I feel like I want to put another
moisturizer on top of it to be
completely honest with you the
strawberry scent is still there but the
cooling sensation is completely gone the
cooling sensation was only during that
wet period which was you know the first
ten or fifteen seconds the product was
on my face unlike aloe and products like
that where you can feel the cooling for
a longer period of time so I personally
wouldn't purchase this for cooling
effects like for sunburn and things like
that even though it's got this little
cool thing on there I don't feel like
that is a selling point on this what
would be the selling point on this is
the strawberry scent to it the good
ingredients that are buried a little bit
whether you buy into that they say that
strawberry extract is really really good
for your skin there I couldn't find any
evidence maybe you can find some
evidence if you can find any evidence
that strawberry extract is good for your
skin please let me know and I will
definitely add it to the description box
in the video so for me personally I'm
very happy to have this the alcohol kind
of freaks me out though so I don't think
I'll be using this regularly but this is
kind of like in every once in a while
when I'm feeling like I want to smell
like strawberries this may be something
I might want to dabble in but that
alcohol thing really truly freaks me out
the fact that it has so much alcohol in
it I mean there are a lot of skincare
products that do have alcohol in them
and seem to work well for lots of people
but for me I personally don't like
alcohol in my skincare how to thank you
so much for watching what the
this week next week we're going to be
talking about the Holika Holika aqua
petit jelly BB cream it is actually a
jelly form of a BB cream and I bought
both shades that both lighter shades and
I got both of them so that we could kind
of compare the shade so you can decide
if either of them are right for you it
does come with a little sponge so we're
gonna be applying it with that so make
sure that you subscribe so you don't
miss it
mad love and I'll see you soon well wave
with both both products this week and
next week mat love have a great week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
