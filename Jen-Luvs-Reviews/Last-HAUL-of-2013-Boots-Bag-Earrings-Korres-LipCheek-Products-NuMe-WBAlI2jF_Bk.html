days ago my jewelmint video of my jewel
mint mystery box opening i'll put the
link to it down below if you did not
happen to see that but i mentioned in
that video that i had an entire Tower of
boxes at my door and after I shot the
Joel men video i decided that i was
going to shoot the rest of them so
that's why i still look like a scrub
it's the middle of the night but i did
want to get this in and show you what i
got the biggest thing i want to show you
was my little black bag because i have
not gotten something from a little black
bag in forever I think it's been since
the summer time so I wanted to show you
what I got I actually got all of this
stuff for $21 including shipping
somebody had used my link as a referral
and they never told me who it was so if
you were the person that signed up for a
little black bag because of my link
thank you so much I really appreciate it
because of you I got a fifty dollar item
for free if you've never heard of little
black bag basically what you do is you
pick out a main item on the site and
then they give you some mystery items
that to go also with that item that you
pick and then you get seven days to
trade your items with other users to
kind of build your ultimate bag is what
they call it even though you may not
always get a purse like this time I wait
did I get a purse I think I did I did
get a purse but it wasn't what I opened
with I actually opened with a pair of
shoes and then I traded some other stuff
to get well I'll just show you I started
off with I think I start off with three
pairs of earrings and then this is what
I kind of traded everything for so shown
you
it's really fun if you have any
questions about how to trade on little
black bag I do have a video 10 tips in
under 10 minutes and how to trade a
little book bag it is a bit outdated but
it still has some good tips that you can
still use so i'll show you my main item
first this is what I open my bag with
and again i paid $21 total for all of
this thanks to that referral so i got
these cute boots and they are by heart
soul I believe heart and soul or heart
soul I don't know if you can see those
it looks like my light there we go now
you can see them I'm very very excited
to wear these this actually was one of
the original items in my bag and I ended
up keeping them I know that retail value
panties were ten dollars I looked at
them for seven days and their pipes in
me and in these little cute little rose
gold earrings and there of course
star-shaped and I just thought they were
super cute and I didn't want to trade
them so I didn't I had a lot of people
offering to trade me all kinds of little
tiny things for these and I'm like now
they're too cute so I kept those and
then the last thing I actually traded
way down for the fifty-dollar jewelry
item this retailed actually only for
thirty-five dollars but it was so cute
that I just I just went for it and it's
this cute little Betsy Johnson bag and
I'm just in love with it I'm absolutely
with it and I love it even more in
person we show you look how stinking
cute that is like I oh my gosh I in love
with this so adorable yeah retail price
was thirty-eight dollars and just I mean
considering that I didn't really pay for
it i only paid for the boots and i still
only pay they were having half price on
the boots so I got half price on the
boots and then I got the fifty-dollar
referrals I just made out like a bandit
and I'm something so okay so I've
unstuffed it and undid everything so
that you guys could see what it really
looks like it's got this cute little bow
here and this little tiny handle it's
also got a crossbody strap that goes
actually across the bag it's attached to
the right side here and the left side
and the back which i think is kind of
interesting here's the inside print I'm
a little Betsey Johnson there and then
little zipper in the back there's
nothing in the front just really cute
inside it says I'll go anywhere with you
Rock sweetie all kinds of things like
that hottie you're hot I mean like
graffiti print just super super cute
gold detailing here for the zipper
zipper feels nice and strong I'm just
absolutely stinkin adorable I am so so
so happy with this so I thank you again
to the person who signed up using my
referral link whoever you are muah let
me know if it was you so i can
personally thank you for for the fifty
dollar credit I just aww so excited
about that okay next up I want to show
you something from hautelook and this I
actually got i ordered this i think the
end of october and i'm just getting it
now and it is the beginning to middle of
december so this one took a really long
time to show so i want to open this I
haven't opened it yet i did on enough i
undid the tape but i didn't open it yet
so this I believe is from Korres yeah
it's all Korres stuff and I'm really
hoping i'm pronouncing Korres right I
think I am okay so what I got was let's
say this is it's been so long I don't
even remember and it's all like Greek
letters on the front so that's not
helping me what are you okay let me just
read the package slip okay I got this
one must be the cheek butter and Eris
coral era squirrel that's pretty there's
the finger swatch I'm not super
pigmented let's try again that should be
nice I'll give you more details about
that in a favorites video coming up I
know I didn't do November favorites I
got swamped with other videos but I'm
going to do an epic December like all
out amazing all my favorite products of
year thing coming up very very soon
that's actually a collaboration with my
friend Adriana so look forward to that
very soon make sure you subscribe so you
don't miss that okay so there's that and
then I got three lips
I got different formulas because I
wanted to try different things I got a
mango butter lipstick a cherry lip gloss
and a lip butter glaze Greek yogurt
nourishing lip cooler they just creative
creative creative look at that look at
the packaging on that that is so pretty
huh that's weird it's got like a silver
ball on the end I wonder if that's
supposed to be like that it's cold but
silver bullets like frozen cold that's
strange i wonder which one this is what
are you you are in raspberry it does
kind of tastes like yogurt which is a
strangely odd there's definitely no
coolness to it though I was expecting it
to be one of those cooling lip balms
it's not interesting and then this one
is in golden pink and then this is the
cherry lip gloss there's the packaging
on that a typical doe foot applicator
that one is definitely more pigmented
but still traditional lip gloss t glossy
just making sure you guys can see that I
feel like my Lighting's off today is my
lighting off today let me know and then
the last one is an actual lipstick frost
pink mango butter lipstick there's the
packaging on that one there's that color
let's watch that one over here oh wow
not sure about that we're gonna have to
try that one and let you know no one
looks kind of frosty for me it doesn't
look super pigmented either maybe it's
kind of like a luster like a Mack luster
you will see it's a sheer color that's
why okay well I'll keep you posted if
you guys tried any of these Korres
products if you have let me know in the
comments because I would love to know
alright the last thing I wanted to show
you that I got a package today is from
groupon goods and I saw this and I could
not resist I think it was like 38 doll
or something like that something really
really cheap where
but bam bam I got me a 32 millimeter
nume curling wand I'll put the price
here that I paid for it but it was
ridiculously cheap the cheapest i've
ever seen these so for I think was like
$55 so when I saw it I jumped on because
I do have a new me reverse and whenever
you see my my hair curled in a video
it's because of the new moon reverse
love it and I wanted one that would make
bigger curls I feel like sometimes I'm
not I don't really want tiny curls so
that's what this one um this thing looks
really inappropriate but this this um I
lost I'm totally distracted at this
point now because of just the way this
thing looks like i can do look at it
seriously I can't even look at it
seriously and talk to you people because
it's just it's a little embarrassing
showing you my wand that's just all i
have to say about that and our i'm
embarrassed in front of my cat i'm
embarrassed in front of her so this is
my wand and it's 32 millimeters and i
wanted bigger curls so i got this one
and the way that I rock this is Bam Bam
and then you hold it and try not to burn
yourself and then you let it go and your
hair is like beautifully curled it does
come with a glove which is very very
helpful for me because I will burn
myself unless I'm wearing the glove
because I'm back klutzy makeups Mustang
not hair so I need as much help as I can
get so that's my hall of my other
packages my my little black bag my
hautelook and my groupon goods so I hope
