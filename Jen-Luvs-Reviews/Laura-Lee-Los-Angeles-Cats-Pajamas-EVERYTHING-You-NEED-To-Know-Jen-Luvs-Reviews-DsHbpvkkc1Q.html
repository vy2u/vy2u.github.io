the Laura Lee cat's pajamas eyeshadow
palettes this palette isn't out yet but
they're people sure have a lot to say
about it so if you want to hear what I
have to say about it after actually
physically drying it stay tuned
very quickly before I go any further
because I know not everybody's gonna
watch the end of this video I do want to
tell you about my relationship with
Laura just so you know because I know a
lot of people are feeling like all of
these reviews are biased
first of all Laura knows exactly what my
channel is about she sent it to me
anyway so that really speaks to her
confidence in this palette because she
knows I'm gonna be a hundred percent
honest with it Laura and I met on a
rooftop bar at generation beauty's
cocktail party I think it was New York
but what happened was as I walked out
onto the rooftop bar and I saw Manny MUA
and Patrick Starr I walked up to them I
said hello I introduced himself Manny
had just done some collab I want to say
it with the Maybelline Club but I can't
say that for sure but anyway so I walked
up to Manny and Patrick and I introduced
myself and I congratulated Manny on his
collaboration and he said have you met
Laura Lee and I said no I haven't and I
had seen maybe one of her videos I
wasn't subscribed I didn't really know
much about her I said no I turned around
and I shook her hand and I said hello
and then I turned around and Manny and
Patrick were like steps away and their
backs were turned to me
so they probably either I'm not judging
them I'm not saying that they were rude
to me I'm not saying that they were not
wanting to talk to me but it did seem
like they didn't really want to talk to
me that was my impression and that's
okay that's alright I'm not my feelings
are not hurt it's okay it happens not a
big deal so Laura and I ended up talking
for about 30 minutes and looking back on
it it was extremely one-sided
conversation where I was mostly talking
about myself and I feel kind of bad
about that but she was so nice to me you
know she was so nice and she was so down
to earth and so kind
since then we've kept in touch with each
other on social media kind of keeping
touch on snapchat and Instagram but not
a lot of conversation if
Laura had a problem she would never call
me and I would never call her because we
are not that close but we're at the
point where we both like each other as
people and we do keep in touch
online oh my gosh like I don't know if
you've kept up on videos about Laura
Lee's cat cat's pajamas org kept up
anywhere on Laura's social media or
anything but man people have some
opinions about this ballot no joke so
what I'm gonna do for you is I am going
to put aside the fact that this is Laura
Lee's palette I am putting aside that I
have met Laura Lee I am not even
thinking about that as I review this for
you because I know that is what you as
consumers deserve but I do want to tell
you a little bit about this palette and
Laura and her company so let's talk
about Laura Lee Los Angeles it is a
brand new clothing / makeup brand she
did release a line of clothing first
which was hot t-shirts and things like
that and now she's releasing an
eyeshadow palette it will be available
at Laura Lee Los Angeles comm on October
30 13th not the 30th the 13th and it
will be $40 and that is where a lot of
people have problems but we're gonna
break that down in a minute
it is cruelty free vegan talc free and
made in the USA
talk a little bit about what you get so
you can see the palette here it has a
smooth glittery cover to it it is a
cardboard packaging inside you get a
mirror that is kind of hidden a little
bit by some of these flowers and then
the flowers inside and then you get 10
to Graham pans there is some
misinformation out there that I do want
to clarify on the front of the box that
I'll show you right now it does say 23
grams net weight when Jeffrey start did
his video on this palette he mistakenly
said that these were point two three
grand pens just give you an idea this is
the lorac pro 2 palette these pans are
0.55 grams so 0.23 grams would be about
half the size and you can see that there
is no way that the shadow in here is
half the size of one of these as far as
weight unless they were extremely thin
these
two gram fans not 0.23 grams the shades
in here are named after different things
that have been said in Laura's comments
about her so okie dokie scatter brain
bomb diggity cray-cray redonkulous
things like that if you've never heard
the term cat's pajamas before it's kind
of like the cat's meow it's when you say
something is amazing you call it the
cat's pajamas
I believe it is a southern term from the
1920s if I remember my googling
correctly this palette is very glittery
and shiny on the outside if you know
Laura's Instagram and her snapchat and
all of that she can definitely glam up
on the outside but on the inside she's
just a good old country girl with her
flowers and very very down-to-earth talk
a little bit more about formula you may
know that I am an ingredient junkie so
we're gonna do a little ingredient
analysis here I did tell you that there
is no talc in this product it is a mica
based product there is at the hexyl
palmitate in it and that is a palm oil
derivative so if you were anti palm oil
for environmental reasons you don't want
to get this if you have an allergic
reaction to fxo palmitate of course you
don't want to get this it is an irritant
for some people also phenoxyethanol is
the preservative used there are no
parabens but some people are also
sensitive to phenoxyethanol
so just so you know that's in here this
is not a lip safe palette there is
ferric ferrocyanide in it which is not
lip safe it is eye safe but other than
that I mean there's a really very small
ingredient list for this product which
is typical of high quality indie brands
I did do a getting ready with me with
this palette and one of the big
critiques I got was that I was comparing
at price program to mainstream Sephora
brand products and people were saying
well she's a brand new indie brand she
shouldn't be charging what she charges
it should be closer to drugstore prices
but I did have some trouble finding
Andie brands that measured things the
way that I like things to be measured a
lot of indie brands like to measure
things by the size of the pan the
millimeters rather than the number of
grams so I didn't want to you know I
wanted to compare apples to apples so I
found some indie brands that do talk
about their grams the cat's pajamas
palette is two graham pans there's 10 of
them
it's a $40 pallet making it $2.00 per
gram so the first one is coloured raine
they have their Queen of Hearts palette
it's $50 for seventeen point five grams
of product equaling 2 dollars and 86
cents per gram so it is about 86 cents
less per gram than color rain colored
rain is cruelty free not vegan they do
appear to be talc free I did compare it
also to color pop to the yesplease
palette now I did email color pop and I
asked them about the size of their pans
whether the palette size pans are the
same as their single shadow pans they
gave me a very unclear answer I'll put
it up here on the screen but for the
purposes of this video we're gonna
assume they're the exact same size as
their individual pans so the yes please
palette is $16 for 12 I shadow they are
1.2 gram pans so they are about half the
size of Laura's a little more than half
the size you get 14-foot point four
grams total which is a dollar and eleven
cents per gram so they are what is that
eighty nine cents more a gram for
Laura's formula when you buy a palette
you kind of expect to get a little bit
of a discount on the single eyeshadow
purchase so the single pans are four
dollars 1.2 grams each that makes them
three dollars and 33 cents per gram for
the single shadows so yes they are less
expensive than the color pop singles per
gram but they are actually more
expensive than if you buy it in a
palette from colour-pop now Luke's a
beauty they don't sell pallets they only
sell the singles so we have to go by
that we have five dollars for one point
three grams single shadows which is
three dollars and 84 cents per gram they
are not talc free their cruelty free but
they're not vegan
and then let's talk about makeup geek
now makeup eat the in the nude palette
is $50 you get 9 1.8 gram pans and they
are 60 16.2 grams total which is three
dollars and seven cents for each gram of
product in her palette I did contact
makeup geek to make sure that they were
the same size and makeup geek confirmed
that the palette shadows for the exact
same size as her singles so you are
getting a better deal with Laura's
palette than you would with a makeup
geek palette the single shadows are six
dollars each and those are three dollars
and 33 cents per gram so she does give a
little bit of a discount when you buy
in a pallet they are cruelty-free
they're not completely talc free but
when there is talc it seems like it's
really lowdown on the ingredient list
and they are not vegan we're gonna stop
right here for just a second because I
did have someone comment about that they
would prefer to buy zoeva over this
palette and I really felt like I wanted
to include that information so I checked
out the Blanc Fusion palette it's 2650
you get ten shadows at 1.5 grams that's
15 grams total which makes it a dollar
77 per gram which is less expensive than
Loras but not by a whole lot it's not
talc free they are cruelty free but they
are not vegans I just wanted to throw
that one in there because I know a lot
of people are really loving soever right
now so compared to other independently
owned brands Loras Falls kind of in the
middle it's a little more expensive than
some but it's less than expensive than
other ones because I didn't expect how
difficult it would be to get information
comparisons what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna compile a list of other
comparisons of other indie brands down
in the description below just for kicks
and giggles I decided I was going to
compare the price per gram to some
drugstore eyeshadow palette so if you
look at the maybelline city mini palette
graffiti pops its $9.99 so you're paying
less upfront for a 3.9 grams of product
you don't get a lot of product in there
that leads to two dollars and 52 cents
per gram so that makes laura's less
expensive the covergirl Roses true naked
eyeshadow palette is $12.99 you get six
point five two grams of product so
that's a dollar ninety-nine per gram so
it's basically the exact same value per
gram as Laura's palette from what I know
model zone is a brand new brand that's
sold at Ulta I'm not a hundred percent
sure on how brand new the brand is but
I'm pretty sure it's brand new they have
a something called a supernatural eye
shadow palette it's $17.99 at 6.8 grams
of product you're paying two dollars and
sixty-five cents per gram so that's 65
cents more than Laura's palette now some
products there are less expensive than
Laura stylet would be like the BH
Cosmetics supernova 18 color baked
eyeshadow palette
you're only gonna pay 46 cents per gram
for that palette which is really
inexpensive and then the makeup
revolution golden bar palette $15 for
that one you're gonna pay 69 cents per
gram of products so it can compete with
some drugstore
products as far as price per gram there
are definitely some better values out
there I have to say I've never
personally tried any of these pellets
but if you have maybe you can speak to
the quality of those products and
whether you think based on what you're
seeing from this palette whether it's
similar quality or not I would imagine
based on my experience with all of those
brands except for models own which I
haven't tried any of their shadows
they're not as good quality typically
from those brands as this palette is one
thing I want to mention about talking
about price program is this is assuming
that you're going to hit pan if you're a
makeup collector it's not really gonna
be about price program for you because
you're never going to hit pan anyway
like that's kind of the way it is for me
so all of that that I just said is
basically irrelevant if you never want a
hit pan what you're going to be
concerned about is the quality of the
shadows and the shade selection and
things like that and that's where you
get into right now with the swatches
both finger and brush swatches they are
done over no primer and I'm gonna go and
show you those right now all right this
is the Laura Lee Los Angeles cat's
pajamas eye shadow palette and all of
its glittery glory we are going to be
doing swatches on my skin tone which is
a light to light medium my friend Jenny
skintone which is a medium and my friend
Debbie who is a deeper skin tone so
let's go ahead and get started with my
swatches this is okey-dokey
scatterbrained bomb diggity and cray
cray
now okie dokie is the one that I've had
the most trouble with on my eyes I've
had a lot of trouble getting it to show
up you'll see the brush swatch in a
second it's absolutely beautiful so I'm
gonna keep playing with this one I
haven't given up hope on okey-dokey but
so far it's not my favorite scatterbrain
is beautiful on the eye it is a bright
bright bright foiled shade I really love
it bomb diggity is a nice matte but cray
cray is my favorite matte in the palette
it's really really nice so that is the
first four all together my favorites in
this quad are scatterbrained and cray
cray and if you're new to my channel
you're new to the wipe test this is
supposed to simulate where time and
whether the eyeshadow will stain the eye
or stain the skin so you'll see that
scatter brain and okie-dokie are gone I
have
had a problem with scatterbrain having
bad lasting power but you may want to
use a glitter glue if you are nervous
about that let's go ahead and move on to
redonkulous quirky kooky and in one ear
these are my four favorite shades in the
palette they are absolutely gorgeous
I feel like kooky squatches really badly
but it performs very well on the eye one
thing you're gonna notice about these
swatches of these four on all three of
our skin tones is that they are very
buildable with the brush you'll I'm
gonna go in and build them with each of
us so you can see how they layer on top
of each other I really like that
actually because when you're blending
them together it's nice to be able to
build back and forth and not go on at
full pigmentation it makes it a lot
easier to use rather than something like
the subculture that goes on like in one
punch you know what I mean so I
personally really prefer the buildable
formula as long as it builds and these
four shades all build beautifully I
don't really have favorites in this for
I like them all they're all very very
nice
and on to the white test you'll see they
all hang out there just to secure
yourself you may want to use a glitter
glue with redonkulous but I honestly
haven't had a problem with where time
with that shade last two shades are out
the other and oddball and you'll notice
again out the other brush swatches
really really really bad I'm gonna show
you another brush in a minute so don't
give up hope on out the other you can
see a hot ball is definitely not the
black oh yeah
so I accidentally swatched brush watch
it twice we're just whatever we're gonna
try to wipe that off yeah but you'll see
that oddball really is more of a
deepening shade rather than a really
really thick black unless you spray some
kind of fix+ on it it's really going to
be something to just kind of deepen the
other colors without being like a really
super harsh black it's not a super
pigmented black black black black inky
black both of these shades I like I
don't think they're the strongest shades
in the palette but I like them and you
can see what the white tests they both
hang out there pretty well so these are
going to have most likely very good
lasting color now here is my friend
Jenny introducing you to her she is a
Filipino descent she has a medium skin
tone so this is what okie-dokie
scatterbrained bomb-diggity and cray
cray look like on her I do apologize I
does go out of focus a little bit and
it's just because I didn't notice while
she was here and I couldn't call her
back over her - so do this again but I
promise you you'll be able to see them
all very well they all look really
beautiful on her
except for bomb-diggity that one's
starting to get really close to her skin
tone so that might be a really nice
all-over lid color for her moving on to
the next four and we literally gasps
when we saw redonkulous on her we went
it was crazy
these shimmer shades are just glowing on
her skin tone they look even better than
they did on me like by far but as you
can see what the brush swatch is we kind
of had the same problem that not problem
but the same thing with with me is that
they definitely need to be built up to
full opacity but this is also nice
if you like in a lighter look and you
don't like things super punchy
personally I like things really really
punchy so building it up is very
important to me but but yeah it's nice
to have that option in case you want to
go for a lighter more muted look you can
see they all build up really really
nicely I thought I had a nice enough
swatch of cooky so I kind of let that go
so this is the next four on Jenny skin
and I think they look absolutely
gorgeous again that's my favorite
there's my favorite shades in the
palette onto the last two out the other
an oddball we have the same swatching
thing without the other where it's super
super light not too much difference here
with the performance of these on her
versus me you can see that the oddball
shade really does look nice and smooth
they all look very smooth on her which I
didn't think really came off as well on
me
now let's move on to Debbie with her
deep skin and this time scatterbrained
made us go oh my girls boots gorgeous
you can't really see bomb-diggity
very well on her I'm not sure if that
would be a great shade for her women a
deeper skin tone will probably be able
to say better again I'm sorry it's
blurry I'm gonna fix it in just a second
cray-cray is just beautiful on her again
that's my favorite matte shade in the
palette I really like it a lot
moving on to redonkulous quirky kooky
and in one ear again just the same with
Jenny I feel like these really popped on
her except for kooky I feel like kooky
is really falling flat as far as the
finger Squatch is here but maybe with on
her eyes maybe it would look better you
can really see the purple of quirky here
and really see that true purple shade
that I feel like is so vibrant on her
and not as vibrant on me and Jenny in
one year also has this pink color on her
that definitely I don't think shows up
as well on me and Jenny as it does on
all rice to say Jenny and I as it does
on Debbie and those are my four favorite
shades in the velvet again there's so
pretty
and finally we're gonna swatch out the
other and oddball on Debbie and these
are blue beautiful on her the brush
swatch it out the other again
pretty pretty stinking weak but again on
my eyes that really did look nice so I'm
thinking that it's just a swatch thing I
don't know but the second squatch
actually does look pretty good on her
definitely think this is a great palette
for deep skin tones based on the
swatches on Debbie's skin I think it
looks fantastic
after I finished filming with all of our
swatches I realized that people were
really going to get on me about not
using a flat synthetic brush so this is
a color pop brush and I decided to use
this to swatch them now I did have to go
in multiple times to get this level of
opacity with this brush this particular
brush did not work well with this
palette I think I just need to invest in
another brush like this to get you
better swatches with this kind of brush
so you know it is what it is but just
know that I had to go in you know three
and four times with some of these shades
to get this level of opacity with that
particular brush all right now you have
seen the swatches let's go ahead and
show you the demo of how I got this look
today so yeah let's go ahead and show
the demo of how I got this look today
alright let's go ahead and get started I
don't usually do talk through tutorials
/ them
first of all the voice overs take longer
and I got a rush to get this one up
before the palate comes out so that you
know whether you want to buy it or not
what is that and number two I want to
make sure that I am telling you how I
feel
in the moment not after I've thought
about it later I do want to let you know
it accidentally got some glitter on my
Beauty Blender and put it on my face
so you'll see random specks of gold
glitter on my face right now I got off
as much as I could and I just I'm
running out of time so that is not due
to the palette that is me actually
dipping my nail into an MBA cosmetics
glitter and getting it on my Beauty
Blender so let's go ahead and get
started and we're gonna use my brand new
Luxy jasmine brush for my crease color
and we're going to start with
bomb-diggity which is this one right
here and this is a perfect crease color
for me I have put these on my eyes four
times at this point not as many as I had
hoped
but I have put them on quite a bit and
I'm gonna try to recreate one of the
looks that I had done actually what I
might do is redo the one that I did for
what's up and makeup
that I got a ton of compliments on this
weekend and nobody knew what palette it
was from so let's go ahead and I think
what it yes okay so what I did was I
took my fingertips and I went into
scatterbrained and then redonkulous and
I put scatterbrained on the inner corner
to the center and then redonkulous on
the outer corner to the center you can
do this with you could do this with a
flat synthetic brush but I personally am
a fingertip kind of girl so I am doing
it with my fingertips because that's
what I like and this is one thing I love
is if you watch how they're crossing
over each other I really like how they
mix together because they're not
overpowering each other they're blending
nicely into each other which I love now
when using a brush there is fallout I'm
just letting you know you might want to
be careful with the shimmer shades and
now we're gonna go in to cooky because I
want to make sure I use some of these
matte shades you just right over the
transition color okay and you could
actually leave the look right there if
you wanted to I am going to just to
deepen it up a little bit I'm gonna go
into out the other and I'm just going to
kind of swirl that in the outer corner
to deepen it up and I'm just going about
half way up into my crease okay now I'm
gonna take the Sigma e30 brush and I'm
going to take let's do out the other on
the lower lash line okay now I'm just
gonna take a let's see hmm let's do
let's do scatterbrain let's be brave
make sure I tap off my brush and I'm
just gonna bring that on the lower lash
line over I'm just gonna take this
little q-tip and just clean up and
sharpen up the edges here you can do
this with tape you can do this with a
shadow shield but I just like to use a
q-tip there's definitely fallout on my
face from scatterbrained not all of it
is that MPA you saw how much there was
before and now I've got more one thing
that's good though is I haven't noticed
fallout through the day that's that much
worse it'll fall a little bit more off
my eyes but what you might want to do
another alternative would be to use
glitter glue overtop of the primer or a
tan substitute for the primer to kind of
make that shadow stick I know some
people use glitter glue for shimmer for
all shimmer shadows which is probably a
good idea but I wanted to show you
without and actually now that I'm
looking at it let's go ahead and take
okie dokie which is the shade right here
and let's just blend out the brow bone
just a little bit
there we go that's better now it looks
more finished all right so now I'm gonna
go ahead and do the rest of my face and
I will be right back all right the rest
of my face is done but I really like the
way that the look came out I'm wearing
gala for Nia by benefit on my cheeks
highlighter is makeup geeks midnight sun
and the lip color is the stay matte
liquid lip color by a Rimmel in the
shade be my baby I said in the past this
was called a Rossetto liquid oh that is
not correct just so you know if you've
ever heard me say that before I was
quite wrong so let me go ahead and zoom
in on my eyes you can see how the eye
look came out and just a reminder I am
NOT a makeup artist this is you know
former teacher mom I shadow look not
trained makeup artist I just realized I
don't think I redid my liner overtop I
don't think you can tell oh one of my
lash is a little funky you just wanted a
little funky it's a little poufy let's
fix that there we go that's better so
I'm gonna go ahead and zoom you out now
and we'll get back to the review let's
go ahead and do a little comparison to
some other palettes that I already own
just kind of eyeballing them just to
show you a little comparison between
this palette and like let's say the
naked heat palette so this is those two
next to each other we do have some
similar shades but definitely some
things that are different I feel like
the gold in here is what I wanted for
the naked heat that I wish that the
naked Heat had but there are some
similar shades in here it's kind of a
similar type of thing but I do feel like
they're going to get different shades if
you do have the naked heat this palette
is going to be different here is it next
to the new Too Faced just peachy mattes
palette and of course they are quite
different but just so you can see the
size of the pans and the color selection
and how they compare of course the peach
palette is much peachy er but just to
give you an idea this is the original
Too Faced peach palette so you can kind
of see how those shades compared there
the honest all modern renaissance
palette looks like that there
there is quite a bit of similarity I
think between these I think more than
any others I feel like these are similar
they're definitely not the same but
they're similar and then this is the
Queen of Hearts palette pied coloured
raine this is one of my favorite
palettes of all time it's amazing and it
looks like this this shade right here
scatterbrain reminds me a lot of the
colored rain shades this royal highness
and your majesty shade it's very flaky
and chunky so definitely keep that in
mind if you've had tried these before
this one is a very similar formula I
feel like the other shimmers are just a
little bit different than this one just
to kind of put your majesty and
redonkulous next to each other they're
very very similar this is your majesty
from colored rain and then this is
redonkulous from cat's pajamas so now it
is time for me to give you my full
review of this palette I am taking Laura
out of my mind I am pretending she
doesn't exist and I'm going to review
this palette for you from a very
objective point of view based on my
opinions if that makes sense what are
the biggest complaints that I hear about
this palette because Laura has gotten a
lot of heat from this palette is that
it's very boring and I would have to say
the shade selection I kind of agree with
you in that you have some Browns here
some you know shades of brown and gold
and then you got Maroons
and you've got this black and this white
I wish that she had been a little more
creative in the color selection I do
have to say the shade quirky is very
unique to my collection I did a halo eye
with this shade and the shade and it
looked gorgeous and it's more purple
than it's showing in the pan hopefully
you saw that in the swatches and I
really loved it and I loved that it
stayed a true purple and didn't turn
grey so how do purples will turn gray on
me and they look terrible
but I can totally see that critique on
this is it'll provide kind of a limited
number of looks because it is just two
kinds of colors and Laura loves these
kinds of colors so I can see why she
picked them
I do wish that she had replaced this
black with a deep brown I feel like the
black really kind of throws everything
if you see some of the tutorials of
people using this Jeffrey star comes to
mind where he throws the black up in the
crease
really weird in my opinion I did not
enjoy that look very much and that has
nothing to do with Jeffrey at all I just
didn't enjoy that look I just I feel
like the black is kind of out of place
I do feel like this white is definitely
should be there I'm glad that she put it
there but it's not my favorite shade in
the palette it's definitely my least
favorite it's the most powdery it's the
one that I know I'm kind of like like I
might have to reach for one from another
palette but other than that I think
these shadows are fantastic as far as
the quality they're really really good
but as far as the boring thing I get you
I hear you I kind of agree
the next big critique is that this is
not a very cohesive palette this is just
I mean it's Laura and a palette people
say you know there's nothing about cats
in here why is it called cat's pajamas
if there's no cats and it's because
cat's pajamas it's the saying it's not
actual cats it's the saying of it but I
can totally see that point to you know
that we've got glitter we've got flowers
and we've got names that apply to her so
I can see that point as well that it's
not the theme isn't really super strong
and less you know Laura and as much as I
know her this fits pretty well and I say
that with the most love in my heart
because I do really like her a lot I
think she's a wonderful person hold on I
let her go back into my head for a
second okay I'm pushing her back out I'm
pushing her back out of my head but I
can see someone not liking the lack of
cohesiveness in the palette I totally
get that
the last big one that I heard a lot is
that she's an Andy brand this is her
first product and she doesn't really
have the right to charge $40 for an
eyeshadow palette if you watch the value
section of this video you'll see that it
is really a fair price for what you get
yeah I don't know of any indie brands
that start off at one price point and
then raise their prices later like have
you ever seen a brand do that I don't
know if that's a strategy that's real
where you start at a lower price point
because you're a new brand and I think
that sometimes people will suggest
something like that and people jump on
it without really thinking about whether
that's real or not
because I don't I honestly I've never
heard of a brand having coming out with
a low price point and then upping their
prices later I think people will be mad
I think I would be mad hey no
a lower pricepoint and all of a sudden
it got more expensive I don't know I
don't know that's just me
based on the quality the shadows I feel
like two dollars per gram is fair
because she has so many younger fans and
because she I've heard people call her
the drugstore Queen I almost wish that
she had done like 1/8 shadow palette
where the pans were like 1.5 grams each
and then brought it down to like 25
dollars I feel like that would have been
better accepted than a 10 pan palette at
$40 if that makes sense
just giving less product for a less
expensive price I saw people say in my
comments actually more than one person
said that they thought this palette
looked like it was worth ten dollars I
don't know where you're shopping for ten
dollar eyeshadow palettes but if you can
let me know where you can get a palette
like this for ten dollars I want to go
there like I will be so excited to go
there because the closest that I have to
something like that would be like five
below I'm thinking of like City color
palettes where the pigmentation is kind
of hit-and-miss and the quality of
ingredients is not good at all I'm also
thinking like Hot Topic
eyes shadow palettes that are made in
China they're mass-produced when you
show you makeup brand on your own you
don't have that luxury of being a huge
company with millions of dollars to kind
of soften the blow if you chop the
prices down at first no color pop
started off as a smaller brand but that
was before they came up with eyeshadow
palettes they had be the single shadows
for a really long time the super shock
shadows was all they had in the lippies
for a while so I don't know what the
cost was on those when they started but
they sure want coming up with eyeshadow
pressed eyeshadow palettes so yes a
brand like color pop might be able to
start off with you know the super shock
shadows and the liquid lipsticks and
kind of rocket but they definitely had a
lot of money that they had already where
Laura is just one person you know what I
mean like they were a company and she's
just a person I don't know if you see
the difference there but I see the
difference so where I want to leave this
with you is who do I think this is good
for and who I think this is not good for
so let's start with those people that I
don't think should purchase this I don't
think you should purchase this if you
already have these shades I don't think
that you're going to find it to be
outstandingly different from the other
shadows that you own also if you don't
like warm tone palettes and then this is
definitely not going to be for you
if your budget is less than $40 and you
just don't have cash for something like
this this is definitely not going to be
for you if you if the design bothers you
and you really just don't like the way
it looks it's not gonna be for you I
don't think that it's fair to throw this
out saying that it is not a good value I
think that that has been disproven in
this video it is a good value for the
amount of products you get so that
should not be the reason why you don't
get it but if it's over your price range
if it doesn't seem to be worth the $40
to you then of course you would not get
it but don't get it because you don't
think it's worth the value as in price
per gram now who this would be good for
of course is laura-leigh lovers people
that love her want to support her of
course is going to be the number one
audience for this also if you like very
highly pigmented easy to blend shadows
and you enjoy this color scheme and that
is who is going to want to purchase this
now I've been asked if this was not sent
to me by Laura what I have purchased it
and I have to be honest with you the
only reason why I would have purchased
this is because I would want to support
her if I didn't know her if I didn't
know this brand I would not have
purchased this eyeshadow palette because
I do have a lot of these shades already
in my collection and I feel like it's
kind of doubling up on things so yes I
would have bought it because I've met
Laura before and because I really like
her but no I wouldn't have bought it if
Laura wasn't attached to it I do want to
make sure that I'm very clear though
that be not purchase has nothing to do
with the quality of the shadows the
quality of the shadows it's is fantastic
but it's just the color scheme I
probably wouldn't have wanted to double
up on colors that I already own so I
hope that you know that's where I'm
personally feeling on it so you just
have to decide for yourself where you
stand on it because we all have
different things that we like and enjoy
and hopefully in this video I provided
you with enough information so that you
can make a decision on what you think
about purchasing this palette on October
