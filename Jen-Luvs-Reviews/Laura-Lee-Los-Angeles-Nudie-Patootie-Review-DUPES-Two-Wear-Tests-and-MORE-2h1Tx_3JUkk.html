final thoughts after trying this for
quite a long time it's nerdi patooty
time are you ready
hang tight we're getting into it right
now if you are new to the channel hello
I actually already did a first
impression review on the new deepa 2d
palette the first impressions aren't
really my thing
I mostly got that out because I knew
people were really curious about buying
it right in that moment so I did
swatches and I did a first impression
but I wanted to do a more in-depth
review for people that really care about
that in-depth information that I
personally care about and love to
provide so today we're going to talk
ingredients we're gonna do to wear tests
and then my final thoughts after trying
this for a while because I personally
feel like it takes more than just trying
something once in order to get a full
thought on something for example the
look that I'm wearing today I have the
NYX glitter glue on one side and the
alit glitter glue on the other because
my biggest critique of this palette
after the first impression was that I
had glitter fallout all over my face so
learning which products work well
alongside of a product using all of the
shades in the palette I feel like this
really important to me to give you a
full picture but I will link that first
impression review down below in case
you're curious what was said in that one
in case you were not familiar with Laura
Lee Los Angeles let's go ahead and break
down some information about the brand so
if you don't know Laura Lee is started
off I believe on YouTube but she also
has a very popular Instagram with
millions of followers and she started
her cosmetic company Laura Lee Los
Angeles with an eyeshadow palette I
believe it was in the fall I do have a
review of the cat's pajamas palette that
I will link down below this is her
second palette in full disclosure this
was sent to me for review purposes in PR
I did also purchase one because I did
not know that she was going to send a
palette again we hadn't talked in a
while so I didn't know that this was
coming so I did purchase one so there
will be a giveaway that I haven't quite
decided exactly how I'm going to do it
so details on that at the end of the
video after I figure out how many up
there will be giveaway on the one that I
personally purchased the product is
in the United States it is cruelty-free
and vegan let's talk about the design a
little bit so she did change up the
design which we went into a little bit
more in the first depression but I'll
give you the crash course and it it is
cardboard packaging there is a magnetic
closure in here but the magnetic closure
is really strong which I absolutely love
that the packaging is very sleek but it
is as you can see very long it is more
expensive than the cat's pajamas palette
but you're also getting four more shades
than you did in the cat's pajamas
palette this one is $45 in every palate
order you do get a nudie patootie card
with Laura's pretty face there and also
descriptions of all of the shades one
thing that's very very important about
the shades is there's an asterisk next
to two of the shades and those shades
are owned at Sorel and jaybird those I
like to call press glitters but Laura
calls them what does she call them but
Laura calls them foiled shadows now I
did see some reviews where these shades
in particular were broken or the product
fell out I believe that is just because
they're the glitter is so chunky in here
that they probably weren't pressed hard
enough didn't have enough binding agent
or a combination of both
for the record mine have no had no
problems with coming out I also took the
one for giveaway I opened it up so it
won't be either the sticker paper is
ripped because I wanted to open it up
and just make sure nothing was broken I
gave it a little shake just like you saw
here and there was nothing wrong with
that one either but I have seen them
break on other people but you know I
personally didn't have a problem so I
can't speak to that one I had a similar
experience with the coloured raine
Cheers the beauty palate where one of
the shadows in there was the same thing
happened it broke on me and coloured
raine replaced it for me I believe that
if you do get one they will be replacing
those for you there are seven mattes in
here which i think is really nice
because I feel like mats are really nice
way to balance out a look and also just
a plain matte look can be very very
beautiful
so the mattes in here are undressed
reveal streaking but naked
we'll get to that in a second strip bare
and Nikki Nikki I do believe the term is
technically buck naked
but butt naked I find to be much funnier
and
it makes me smile more than buck-naked
so I'm actually very glad she called it
butt-naked along with that you do have
ones that I would call foiled slash
metallic shades
that's topless undercover exposed and
buff there are two duo Chrome's in here
which are really cool one of them is
topless which is what I'm wearing on
most of my lid today the other one is
j-bird and when I did the first
impression demo of this product I used
j-bird all over my lid and people so
many people were like why is it one
color on one lid and one color on the
other lid and I probably answer it at
least seven or eight of them saying it's
a duochrome shade it's the same color it
just shifts it is really really really
cool how it does that it's really really
pretty the other one is topless where it
does have a little bit of a bold reflect
in the background but the duochrome is
not nearly as strong as in j-bird it
just has a tiny bit of a shifty
undertone to it both of them are very
beautiful shades as far as the shade
selection in here I am I have to tell
you I am a little bit disappointed in
the lack of mid-tone shades in here
there's lots of light and a couple of
dark which make it a little bit more
difficult for people with deeper skin
tone to use at least from tutorials that
I've watched of lots of palettes I love
to watch people of many different skin
tones that goes from very very fair to
very very deep so I can learn about how
products work for people of different
skin tones and looking at this based on
my background knowledge it just seems
like this would be very difficult to
work with for people of color just
because there's so many light shades
does it mean that people of color won't
be able to work with this no I think
that people of color will be able to
work with this but maybe not as a
complete palette maybe having to bring
in other shades to go with it and it is
very light heavy so if you don't feel
like you have a lot of use for lighter
shades then this may not be worth it to
you I mean I think jaybird and unnatural
will look gorgeous on everybody but
we've got these kind of disco ball
looking shades over here that may be a
little more difficult or a little less
useful for people with deeper skin tones
it is nice that these are so dark though
when Laura did her video I thought that
these were going to be lighter and I
thought that that was going to make this
even less people of color friendly but
they are
quite deep which I'm very appreciative
of because it definitely even helps me
with my skin tone to be able to create
some more depth and dimension with the
shades before we go into the demo of how
I got this look today and the wear test
let me just go a little bit into
ingredients I'm trimming down my
ingredient alysus to just include
ingredients that I think you might want
to know about based on the comments
because I used to say all of them so now
I kind of know which ones are the
hot-button one so first of all there is
talc and mica and both of these some
people are sensitive to talent and some
people are very anti mica for human
rights reasons and if you're curious
about that you can always search mica
human rights look up articles look up
YouTube videos and learn more about that
there is at the hexyl palmitate in here
as well which is also a very common
ingredient in cosmetics and especially
eyeshadows that is a palm oil derivative
where some people do not use palm oil
derivatives for environmental reasons
two more things tocopherol acetate which
is a form of vitamin E some people are
sensitive to that so I wanted to let you
know and also phenoxyethanol is the
preservative in here there are no
parabens but but some people are
sensitive to phenoxyethanol so I did
want to mention that in case that's you
some people like to tap I shadow zon to
their lips for a fun effect I would
imagine most of these are lips safe if
you want to know which ones have the
ultramarines which is listed as a may or
may not contain pigment which is not lip
safe I'm hoping that if you contacted
Laura Lee Los Angeles they would be able
to tell you which shades contain
ultramarines I did not do that I just
thought of it just now I probably should
have asked but I didn't so I'm sorry
about that but ultramarines are not lips
safe all the pigments do look like
they're eye safe though so that's really
good so now let's go ahead and have some
fun and let's put these on the eyes and
see how it looks and molds you all wear
tests and we'll see how these last of
the day and see if we get the insane
amount of Fallout that I got on the
first time that I tried it in the first
impression so let's go ahead and I'll
show you that right now
let's get the headliner stick it through
the thing you told me we fought Starfire
and you taste like ever seen homegirl
tell me pin it's the last head first
time don't even know your food are doing
this ever for the first time got your
hands off in my part
if you started started
wish watch you brush but you gloss on
your baby
nobody talking
tsubasa watching us up
and you know strangers they got raided
this week ended I gotta chase it
I bought the bread to feel wrong girl
tell me when what's the last on her
first time normal yeah but I'll be doing
this forever for the first time
it's all in my party started
now that you have seen them applied let
me go ahead and show you the time it is
currently 3:16 and yea so I will be back
at the end of the day to show you how
this war and then we're gonna do a
second wear test and that is going to be
the doop wear test I'm gonna try to find
other shadows in my collection that are
similar to this one and kind of put them
head-to-head and see if the gnudi
patootie can outperform them and then
we'll do final thoughts so it's gonna be
many hours for me just a couple of
seconds for you let's go ahead and see
how these more through the day alright
to my friends it has been about eight
almost eight and a half hours since I
put this eyeshadow on let's go ahead and
zoom in and see what we're dealing with
here alright so I've got some opinions
here I've got some opinions remember for
this look I did do something different I
didn't apply a primer down I just went
in straight with the glitter glue
because I wanted to see how that would
work so I've got the Lickliter glue on
this side the NYX glitter glue on this
side I do still have glitter fallout
under my eyes unfortunately which makes
me so sad because that means that every
glitter glue that I own
none of them hold on to the glitters
completely is it so bad that I think
everybody would notice and be like Walsh
we got glitter all over a whole face no
I don't think many people would notice
but I notice and it's kind of like myrrh
so that's kind of a bummer I also
noticed with the NYX side we have some
transferring of the glitter up onto the
brow bone but on the lit side I have a
little bit of a space here there's no
transfer but I've got a little bit of a
space so it's the nick side is very
similar to the Too Faced the glitter
glue I do think that the glitter fall
out throughout the day is a little bit
worse on the lit side so it probably
won't use that with this palette again
I'll probably stick with the Nixon the
Too Faced but just know that the glitter
is going to fall if I use one of the
shimmer shades just such a bummer I've
also lost a lot of my separation of
color between the deep shade and the
medium shades and the medium shades with
each other which is different because
every other time I've used this I felt
like the separation of color stayed
really good throughout the day so I
think that's due to me not you
using a regular eyeshadow primer first
and just jumping straight into the
glitter so for tomorrow we will
definitely use a regular primer first
because I don't like that that's faded I
got a little bit of a wonky lash on this
side but that's not the eyeshadows fault
so does it look terrible after eight
hours no does it look the same am i
super impressed with it absolutely not
but I do think that it's due to me not
using an eyeshadow primer down first so
if you are going to purchase this make
sure you do pair it up with an eyeshadow
primer it will make a really big
difference in the lasting power alright
let's go ahead and zoom out real quick
dey's done gone the Sun and my halo hair
extension it's over it's done I am ready
to take the hair off all the fake hair
all of it every bit of fake hair that is
on me is gone now I've got my lashes off
I've got my hair off I'm going to bed we
will be back in my time tomorrow for you
in a couple of seconds with the second
wear test and I'm really excited for
this one because this is the dupe look
and I haven't found the dupe to my
collection yet but I have faith I have
faith I'm going to find them and we're
gonna create a look oh it's so excited
alright see you in a second hello we're
back for day 2 demo slash where tests
slash awesomeness with lon things
happening outside we're just gonna
ignore we're gonna pretend like it's not
there so today this is an exciting day
what I realized when I went to go film
this which was the day after what she
just watched is I realized that I didn't
have a lot of dupes especially drugstore
dupes and I want to give you more
drugstore options or less expensive
options for higher-end palettes so I
went to the drugstore and I purchased
like fifty seven dollars worth of
drugstore eyeshadow it's to try to find
dupes for this I also went through my
high-end collection and tried to find
dupes for some of the shades so I've got
a lot of information for you I'm gonna
go ahead and share that with you first
and then we're gonna get into the dupe
look which is also extremely out of my
comfort zone but we'll get into that in
a minute let's talk about dupes and
we're gonna stop talking Jen just go
alright so here is the
deepa 2d pellet and we're gonna be
talking about the dupes that I found in
my collection and also comparing to some
things that are available in the
drugstore right now I want to preface
this by saying I do not believe that
Laura created this palette with thoughts
of other palettes in her mind there are
just only so many colors out there
available so please don't take this as
me saying anything negative against
Laura in any way at all so when I heard
people comparing this palette to other
palettes the first thing I heard was
comparing it to the Naked 3 palette by
urban decay this is kind of the iconic
pink palette but one thing you'll notice
about this is that the naked 3 is
extremely cool tone so when you put them
next to each other they really have
absolutely no similarities I tried to
find a single dupe in The Naked 3 for
something in the gnudi patooty could not
find a single dupe they are completely
different palettes for example in the
drugstore you might find the covergirl
true Naked Roses palette and you'll see
that this is very similar to the Naked 3
but not to the nudie patootie there's
also the new City kits pink edge palette
by Maybelline again very cool tone this
one is a little bit closer to the nudie
patootie but it's still very cool toned
pink overall this is the new L'Oreal
paradise palette the one that smells
like peaches I feel like this one is
probably one of the closest
comprehensively to the tone of the nudie
patootie but it's still very different
another comparison that I heard was that
it was similar to the Anastasia Beverly
Hills soft glam palette now I don't own
that but I do own the quote dupe palette
by bad habit this is the arabesque
palette and looking at those next to
each other yes there are some
similarities and I'll show you some
dupes from this palette in a bit but
again it's very very different
comprehensively overall looking at the
you had me at hello palette by color pop
again we're leaning toward that more
warm color pick but this one's more of a
berry two Browns rather than a peach two
Browns alike the nudie patootie the
speaking of peach let's talk about the
Too Faced sweet peach palette and
that those swatches again very very
different color scheme there are some
similar shades in there but very
different color scheme now of course the
only way it is truly tell what shades
are dupes are not is to put them
directly next to each other so we're
gonna go through each shade of the nudie
petunia palette and talk about the dupes
let's start with stark so we've got the
Too Faced natural love palette shade
poodle we've got that L'Oreal new
palette shade one the Too Faced peach
palette white peach and color pops you
had me at hello palette in the not and
as you can see some of these are Matt's
the one in the Laura Lee palette is a
shimmer depending on what you want to do
with these you may be able to use the
matte ones for the same purpose but
really the closest dupe we have here is
that color pop you had me at hello then
not shade
moving on to undressed I really had a
hard time finding a dupe for this which
was really surprising everything was
either too light or too champagne or too
dark and the only one that I could find
that was similar was the Too Faced
natural love spotlight and I do feel
like they are similar even though the
Laura Lee one is slightly darker next we
have topless and I was a little
surprised at how many similar shades I
had to this we've got Jacqueline Hills
little lady two-faced natural love
honeymoon the new L'Oreal palette shade
10 the bad habit Nutcracker shade and
then the color pop you had me at hello
in candygram
to me the closest dupes are that Jaclyn
hill a little lady and then the bad
habit shade and Nutcracker I will be
listing all of these dupes down below
including the match up shade for the
Anastacio palette with the bad habit
palette streaking is the next shade and
again I couldn't find an exact do but on
the eyes these are probably going to
look quite similar we've got the Too
Faced natural love honey butter next to
stormy skies the first shade and the
Jaclyn hill M feo shade and you know
these are pretty relatively
interchangeable I feel like the closest
one is probably again the Jaclyn hill
one but and they're all kind of similar
uncover is the first kind of shimmery
disco ball shade that we're coming
across the dupe shades are Jacqueline
Hills obsessed and the Too Faced natural
love cutie-patootie you might be
starting to see a trend in
the amount of jacqueline hill and Too
Faced natural love palette dupes we're
gonna get into I'm gonna show you all
that later
going over to strip again I had a lot of
trouble finding a dupe for this shade
nothing matched closely except for
creamsicle by Jacqueline Hill pukey was
kind of close but it's a little bit
darker but nothing was an exact match in
my collection
I feel like bear was definitely the
hardest one to match to face candied
peach from the peach palette is the
closest in my opinion also the Loreal
shade and the new palette number seven
that's one actually it's closer to the
Too Faced candy peach than it is to bear
but it's the closest that I had so I
wanted to show them to you expose the
other shade that I like to call the
disco ball shade
Jacqueline Hills hustle is right next to
it along with color pops had you had me
at hello the shade is called DTR I feel
like Hustle is almost an exact dupe for
tone but the Laura Lee one has a
significant amount more sparkle it is
definitely more poppy than be Jacqueline
Hill one once again o naturale we've got
Jacqueline Hills Queen and Too Faced
natural love dear diary and queen really
is a very close to reveal is the tan not
brown with this again no exact dupe the
closest was the Too Faced natural love's
nudie I did want to show you the bad
habbit waltz shade because I feel like
if you go with a light hand you can
probably use it in a very similar way
now j-bird is that duochrome that Laura
threw in there it does shift from this
reddish shade to a gold shade I do not
have a shade in my collection that is
exactly the same as this but the ones
that I feel are the closest that don't
have that to a chrome shift but do have
that reddish shade are Jacqueline Hills
fire work and the Too Faced natural
loves hot and bothered which I feel like
are pretty much exact dupes those too
but they don't have that gold shift that
the nudie patootie does I was not as
surprised to find so many dupes for this
shade I do like it in the palette I
think it's a good shade for the palette
but definitely doable for but naked we
have Jack
Hills buns then we have the Too Faced
natural love makeup and chill L'Oreal
the new palette number 11 the bad habit
shade in ballet slippers color pops
double-entendre palette in hard and
color pops you had me at hello want you
back I really truly feel like you could
use any of these shades and it would
look pretty much exactly the same on the
eye too more shades left this one was a
little bit more difficult to do because
of the sparkle in the background this is
buff and the closest I could find was to
face natural love chocolate martini
which does have a different color
sparkle in the background but yet it
does have some sparkle and they are very
close and finally we have Nikki Nikki
and again not super surprised that I was
able to find some dupes for this
Jacqueline Hills a Central Park bad
habbits melodrama the double entendre
from colour-pop teddy bear and color
pops you had me at hello sparks fly are
very very similar because there were so
many dupes
in the Jacqueline Hill palette I wanted
to swatch the dupes next to each other
so as you can see there are nine shades
here that can be sort of duped with the
Laura Lee palette so if you do have the
Jacqueline hell morphe palette you may
want to skip on this one you may want to
pass what you're going to be missing out
on is the intensity of those flailed
shades the foiled shades are definitely
more pigmented and more intense in the
Laura Lee palette than they are in the
Jacqueline ill palette but the tone is
very very similar I also wanted to show
you the Too Faced natural love palette
with those dupes next to each other
there's nine of them here and I do feel
like again the Laura Lee palette is more
pigmented than the Too Faced palette but
if you do have the natural love palette
and you're not dying over the
differences then you may want to pass on
the gnudi patootie so as you can see I
had a really hard time finding dupes in
the drugstore but the best dupe pallets
that I could find were the Jacqueline
Hill morphe palette which had quite a
few shades and also the Too Faced
natural love palette I felt like those
were the closest as far as getting as
many dupes for this palette but what it
comes down to is the majority of pink
palettes that are out there are more
similar to the Urban
kay naked3 palette they're very cool
tone where this one is more warm tones
it is more unique is it completely
unique no not completely unique I wanted
to do something out of my comfort zone
for this look because I feel like I can
always expand my makeup techniques and
what better way to do it than to do it
with you because you might be able to
give me tips on how I could do things
even better and and why not use you as a
resource for helping me to be better at
what I do so I found a really really
hard makeup tutorial
her name is makeup by Rose xoxo she has
33 thousand subscribers this look is
gorgeous on her and I'm hoping that I'll
be able to recreate it but the problem
was every tutorial that I found that was
inspiring it used the shade bear which
is the one that I couldn't find any
exact dupes in my collection for so
we're just gonna dip into the Too Faced
peach palette to find something similar
it's not the same but the majority of
these shadows I'm going to use are going
to be from the drugstore priced palettes
because I want to see if the Laura Lee
palette can beat these drugstore type
palettes I'm gonna link roses video down
below in case you want to check out the
original version of this look alright
you ready for this I'm ready for this
let's have some fun
I've put the brakes on before you could
start it turns out the beat Omaha you
ain't got it think you had me but you
better turn it oh the problems the baked
asleep under the carpet
but you don't know what you didn't know
we talked about you know what you didn't
know but
you
you think is the everyone awesome you
just drop in the Eddie's oceans yeah
the sexiest fish if you wanna keep going
as long as I'm talking to make sure they
know it
we're just gonna pause for a second okay
so maybe Rose is able to do this without
a wet brush but it sure does look like
these colors are wet so I'm gonna go
ahead and I'm gonna wet this brush and
I'm gonna wet it with some setting spray
and try to do what she's doing because
it's just it's powdery it's not as crisp
as what she's doing so I think I
personally need some fix plus of course
I can't find my fix plus so we're just
gonna use the Makeup Forever mist and
fix and try to get it as sharp as hers
is
I'm definitely not completely even and I
feel like these are not as high up as
hers and I feel like they're kind of
dragging my eyes down
give me deeper now we're getting deeper
I don't wanna do it
that was interesting
I'm not sure how well I pulled off this
look but I tried my best and that's all
we can do and I had fun doing it I don't
think I look like her at all but but we
tried you know and the most important
thing is that we're testing out these
eye shadows next to each other so are
they gonna stick to the face this is the
first time I've tried the new deeper 2d
palette over top of concealer I've tried
them over many different three different
get glitter glues I've tried them wet
everything makes the glitter fall down
on my face throughout the day so I'm
curious if the concealer might be able
to hold on to these shadows we shall see
so right now it is currently let's see
if I can get my notifications to turn
away it is currently 316 in the
afternoon so I will be back at the very
end of the day to check in and see how
this war through the day and to see if
the gnudi patootie looks better than the
less expensive shadows that I used - the
Too Faced one because that was the only
one that had that match that look but
that's another story that I already told
and I'm knocking things over and I
should go so we'll see you in a couple
of seconds at the end of the day all
right it's actually only been 45 minutes
I just can't stay away from you I just
missed you too much okay so it is almost
four o'clock and I looked in the mirror
I just picked up my car from getting
some work done on my car and I'm looking
and I'm like oh my gosh
number one this crease is not blend at
all number two the glitter transfer of
that one shade on the gnudi patootie
palette when is it what's this one
called exposed yes exposed is out of
control let me go ahead and zoom you in
so you can see I'm not sure if you saw
this 45 minutes ago or not but
I didn't see it until just now the
difference between the two sides if you
can see the glitter transfer up into the
crease and on to the brow bone pretty
much every time I use these shades I
have that problem and I don't know what
she can do to fix that but it's not
staying put
where I put it now compared to the
Jacqueline Hill which was the dupe for
the expose that I use I think it's
called hustle the exposed one the
laura-leigh one is much more glittery
it's much chunkier so you get a more
intense sparkle but the transfer is just
insane so one other thing I wanted to
mention about just comparing the using
the drugstore shadows versus using the
Laura Lee palette I found that the
drugstore shadows were a little harder
to work with a little harder to blend
especially when I ended up in wet that
was when I really feel like that was
when it kind of all went to crap on my
left side or your right side so I'm just
gonna take a second I'm just gonna blend
this a little bit more on this side
because it's driving me insane looking
at it and I'm gonna blend this side to
just a little bit so they match a little
bit better I'm not going to touch up the
glitter side I'm just gonna let that be
but I did want to mention that I did
notice that that it's already
transferring up and I wanted to show you
in real time when I know to something I
want you to see it too now in the demo
she had a very strong cut crease there I
just I couldn't get a sharp line
especially starting off with a dry brush
rather than a wet brush because I didn't
hear if she did say in the directions to
wet the brush I must have missed that
part but I did not wet the brush
initially and it doesn't matter whose
fault it just didn't work for me so
blending it out I think is gonna be my
only option and I think that looks much
better now I do feel like the other
shades in the Laura Lee palette other
than the exposed shape were much easier
to use than their drugstore counterparts
so I'm gonna go ahead and do what I said
it was gonna do last time I'm gonna go
and I'm gonna come back at the end of
the day and we're gonna do final
thoughts on on this palette we're gonna
look at where time and all of that and
glitter fall out and just kind of wrap
this baby up
alright we'll be right back I pulled my
hair down because I was getting a really
bad hair head
and I just couldn't take it so we have
hair down now
but hair has nothing to do with this
video it has to do with the eye shadow
and I'm actually quite surprised at the
results let's go ahead and zoom in and
let's take a look together I forgot to
tell you it's about 11:30 at night so we
are at 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 8 hours a
little over 8 hours which is a typical
school workday for those that have those
at typical times
ramune not so much so yeah let me go
ahead and close and show you what we're
dealing with here very very very very
very interesting I wasn't expecting the
drugstore side to last this well with
the separation of color and everything
as you can see the shimmer has
definitely traveled even more up from
the Laura Lee palette it's all over the
place but you can see the Jaclyn Hills
side has also traveled up so I don't
know if that has to do with the
concealer that I use that I didn't use a
glitter glue it might be possible I
don't typically use concealer in my
looks but I was going out of my comfort
zone and I know a lot of people do use
concealer on their lids so you know I
mean this is just it is what it is let
me just close my eyes one more time so
remember this is drugstore this is the
Laura Lee and we'll go ahead and zoom
out for final thoughts all right so this
is kind of how I'm feeling right now I'm
feeling like that I'm too low down
that's something I'm feeling like there
we go okay I'm feeling like I really
like the nudie patooty palette and let
me tell you why I really like it and why
I don't love it I really like it because
I feel like that the ease-of-use
is definitely there I felt the blend
ability the seamlessness of it was
really really really good for me where I
don't like it is that I'm still having a
lot of trouble with the shimmery shades
especially exposed oh natural and
jaybird those are the ones that I feel
like I'm having the most trouble with
not necessarily putting them where I
want them but keeping them where I want
them and I'm not traveling wherever they
feel like it hopefully you can see when
you're zoomed
and I do still have a lot of glitter
fallout on this side I do not have that
on this side but that I can attribute to
the chunky glitter of that shade exposed
that is definitely what is this fallout
throughout the day if I had to give the
gnudi patootie a one two five rating I
would probably give it a four it's good
but it's not great it's not a palette
that I'm going to reach for all of the
time but I can see myself reaching for
it some of the time because one other
thing I do feel like this palette has
going for it is that it is a pretty
unique color selection I know there's
gonna be people that are gonna argue
with me about that but I'm telling you
it is unique I don't have anything like
this where I can get all of this in one
palette you saw how many pounds I had to
use in my collection in order to even
get close to these shades if you have
the Jacqueline Hale morphe palette if
you have the Too Faced natural love
palette you may want to consider
skipping this if there aren't any
additional shades that are calling to
you because there are a lot of shades
that are pretty repetitive and those too
but if you don't own either of those two
and this is calling to you I think you
might like it the lasting power on it is
very good and it just so happens that
all the drugstore palettes that I use
today also had good lasting power a lot
of these are very new to me this one and
this one these are ones that I've just
bought for this video specifically so I
can't speak to their lasting power on
their own but but yeah I'm looking
forward to trying them more because they
seem like they're pretty good palettes
except for that they just were a little
bit more difficult to work with than
this giveaway by the way we are going to
have a giveaway I will link the rules
for the giveaway down in the video
description but we are going to be
giving away the annuity patootie that I
purchased giveaway will end one week
from today so just very quickly who do I
think this is good for I think this is
good for people that like lighter shades
that you have use for a lot of lighter
shades people that like warm pink tones
gold tones just warm tones in general
because this is overwhelmingly a warmer
palette there are some cooler shades in
here but it's mostly warm I do think
that if you like mats and
you love working with match you're
probably really going to like this if
you like this duochrome Shay j-bird
you're going to love this this is a
really really fun shade to play with
people that are not going to like this
of course are people that are not don't
like the color scheme that don't need
all of the light shades that are
included people that do not like glitter
fall out throughout the day on their
cheeks you're probably not going to like
this unless you figure out a way to use
it that I haven't figured out yet if you
have by the way definitely leave that in
the comments below
I do find overall this is very easy to
work with except for these these
shimmery glittery shades that just seem
to be a little too chunky and they just
don't adhere to the eye the way that I
hope that they would but other than that
I mean I I feel like if I had the
opportunity to return this
I would not return it I I think that
this would be worth my purchase but you
know you have to decide for yourself
whether it's worth it for you I like my
nudie patootie but the question is do
you like nudie patootie but let me know
what you think in the comments down
below do you like it are you planning on
purchasing it do you already own it what
do you think of it if you do please let
me know in the collective brain of
makeup awesomeness where we help each
other not to buy crap and to buy things
that are totally worth it please leave
your thoughts about the nudie petunia
palette down in the comments below so we
