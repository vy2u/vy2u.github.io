filming today but I got something in the
mail that was very surprising to me I
really did not think this was coming and
where did I put it
it's over there in a second so anyway
super surprised to get this in the mail
and knowing me it's going to take me
like two weeks at least maybe even three
weeks did you a full review of this but
I know there's a lot of confusion and
questions about this product so I
figured I would just do like a quick
swatch I look first impression of the
Laura Lee Los Angeles nudie patootie
palette so if that sounds interesting to
you hang tight we're gonna get into it
right now it is currently Saturday in my
time my one that I purchased is actually
coming on Monday I had no idea I knew I
wanted to review it but I didn't know
that she was gonna send it to me so I
bought it so that one's gonna be
forgiven in the video that's coming up
so keep an eye out for the full review
for the giveaway of the one that I
purchased so this is the one that she
sent I know there's been some confusion
as far as the shade so I'll go ahead and
put up a couple of the pictures that
Laura has put up she put up a video and
she also put up some images and I know
people were really confused about the
shades was it more pink was it more
brown and to me it looks like it's
somewhere in between now let me show you
the packaging then it comes in for those
of you that are getting it soon it does
come in the Laura Lee Los Angeles box
and that it's got her logo stamped their
women we got the PR last time it was for
the cat's pajamas palette it was really
fancy packaging and even though the
presentation was gorgeous and I was very
thankful for it I'm kind of glad she
toned down on it cuz I don't feel like
it's a hundred percent necessary for her
to number one spend the money and number
two for the waste that packaging costs
for doing things like that I mean it
just gets thrown away just like I said
in the last video Laura's an
acquaintance of mine we actually haven't
talked hardly at all since the last
videos which is why I thought that she
probably wasn't going to send this to me
so this is a pleasant surprise - Thank
You Laura for saying this to me but as
you know just like in the last video I
am going to give you my honest opinion
everything it doesn't matter if she send
it to me or not I did purchase it with
my own money so I'm out the same
money that everybody else is this is the
card that comes with it I really like
that she included this she's got her
picture there and then on the back it's
really cool she's got the picture of the
pallet with the shade spilled out and
she's got descriptions of each one and
this is really smart of her she's got a
couple of little asterisks next to
j-bird and next to o naturale those are
the what I would call pressed glitter
shades and she's got a loo note it says
denotes best results when used with
glitter glue or a wet brush they remind
me a lot of the MPA cosmetics Krummel
lights that I love because they are so
opaque they're even more opaque than
those in my opinion but you're gonna see
that in the swatches in a second if you
look at the difference between the size
of the cat's pajamas in the nudie
patootie you're getting for extra shades
in the nudie patooty she also did a lot
of packaging changes there were a lot of
complaints I just you know details as
far as the packaging that people didn't
like one thing that people didn't like
was people I think people like the outer
packaging but when you opened it up it
was quite different you had the
obstructed mirror you had the print that
people weren't a fan of because it
looked like the same flower pasted over
and over you also had that the names did
not match the cat's pajamas theme and
also people were saying that the shades
were boring which was kind of my biggest
critique not that they were boring but
they were just more typical that I
wanted something a little more
interesting
it looks like Laura has listened to
those critiques if you look at this one
it's very sleek looking and you open it
up there's no pattern there's no
obstructive near the mirror is huge it's
not a wonky mirror and then the shade
names match the theme everything in here
is a nude theme so we've got stark
undressed topless streaking on uncover
and you should even got butt naked over
here which I thought was hilarious and
also she's definitely put in some unique
shades some things that are actually
unique to my collection which I was so
happy to see when I saw this I
immediately thought naked 3 immediately
thought naked 3 but when I put them next
to each other they're really not the
same they're not even close to the same
I mean it's very very different and
first impressions I haven't put this on
my eyes oh but first impressions I'm
really interested in trying the matte
shades in here they're really
interesting I would love to create
just like a straight matte look with
like strep and bear and I'm Nicki Nicki
and I just think that would be gorgeous
with a little bit of Stark maybe just in
the inner corner it's a little bit shiny
there because I always go over this just
so you know this is made in the United
States price point is $45 and the cat's
pajamas was $40 just a little bit about
cruelty free this is a cruelty free
product it does have the PETA Bunny on
here if you want to know about more
about PETA certification which is
basically very very easy to get I will
link my video with Courtney on questions
about cruelty free down below alright
now that I've rambled enough let's go
ahead and get into the finger and brush
swatches and then I'm gonna do my very
first look with this palette and give
you some first impressions all right
here is nudey patootie what I did for
this video is I color corrected the
video so that and I held the palette
right up to the screen to try to get
these to look exactly the way they look
in person and like I think I got as
close as I possibly could so let's start
with the top row which is all light
shades my cats meowing next all right so
we have stark undressed topless and
streaking and as you can see Stark does
not apply that well with a finger or a
brush but it is a little bit buildable
as you can see in the brush swatch when
you pat it on the fingertip with the
fingertip in the inner corner it's
absolutely beautiful I'm dressed as a
beautiful Matt topless does brush swatch
a little bit better this one is also
buildable and then streaking a SWAT
brush watches really well as well just
really nice clean matte shade and this
is the first floor all together as you
can see they're all very light if you're
new to my channel then you are new to
the wipe test and the purpose of this is
to show if the product stains the skin
and I found that products that stain the
skin tend to last longer on the eye so
as you can see the before like shades
they're actually staining the skin a
little bit which I was surprised of
course except for Stark which is that
white shade going on to the next four
these are also all very light
we have undercover strip bare and
exposed now it looks alike undercover
and exposed are very similar and they
are exposes just a tad bit deeper and
the glitter is a lot
chunkier but they are quite similar I
wish that they even had more of a
difference I wish xposed was about four
shades darker and that would have been
amazing for me but that's just what I
would want it's not my palette strip and
bear also brush swatch just the same as
the other mats they're just beautiful
beautiful smooth shades and like I
mentioned exposed just has a chunkier
glitter in it and is a little bit deeper
than undercover so keeping in mind your
skin tone looking at these these are all
of the light shades so we're looking at
a little more than half the palette are
light so keep that in mind and then as
we do the wipe test we notice that all
of them except for that first one do
stain the skin just a little bit you're
going to get the most staining out of
neat matte shades these to me are the
medium tone shades so we've got own
natural reveal jaybird and butt naked
when i first fingers washed own natural
and jaybird i literally gasped I went oh
because they were just so so pretty now
when you look at the brush swatches
though you can see they don't brush
swatch very well but they do build so
when that brush goes in there that
second time they do build up with a
brush and they aren't able to be applied
to the eye with a brush which is great
you'll notice the same thing with
jaybird again not brush watching very
well the first time but the second time
across you can really see that shades
starting to build the matte shades again
still very consistent throughout this
palette as being nice and smooth for
medium shades these really aren't super
deep I would still consider them medium
shades but they're really relatively
light for medium shades now wiping them
away you can really tell what Laura was
talking about about needing a glitter
glue especially for jaybird you can see
jaybird is completely gone it is not
there anymore but own a Terrell does
still have some of that staining one
thing to take note of is the undertone
of these shades are pretty much exactly
the same so if you choose to pair these
shades together throughout the day they
may muddy more than some of the other
shades you may want to mix these four
shades and with some of the even lighter
shades and some of the deeper shades to
make sure you don't have that muddying
through the day and on to those last two
these are the deep shades in the palette
I was very happy to see that these were
much deeper than I thought they were
after watching Laura's video the big
difference between these is that buff
has shimmer and Nikki Nikki is matte
again we have that building thing that
we're gonna have to do with buff but it
really is a beautiful shade it's got a
really nice little coppery pink shift to
it it's very pretty and then Nikki Nikki
is probably my least favorite of the
mattes but it does build and it is
really nice to work with on the outer
corner to kind of buff and blend in and
get a really nice gradient with the
medium shades of the lighter shades and
wiping them away these are like
impossible to wipe away especially buff
it has got so much pigment I did try to
remove this with some ice alert water
and I actually had difficulty removing
it with from my arm with I had to you
know go over it a couple of times
because there's just so much pigment in
buff so now you have seen the swatches
let's go ahead and do a look now this is
just me playing this is not a full
review like I was saying earlier but I
do want to says I'm gonna try it on
anyway I figured I might as well do it
on camera I did watch Laura's video but
it's been a while so I'm hoping that I
remember enough about what she had said
about it I I'm debating on what kind of
look I wanted you because I really want
to play with these mats but at the same
time jaybird is calling to me so we'll
see what happens as we go I saw all my
monthly favorite stuff sitting here all
up in my way coz that video was supposed
to go up first alright let's go ahead
and zoom you in I've got my shadow
insurance I've got my two-faced glitter
glue the NYX glitter glue to me is just
as good as the Too Faced though so don't
feel like you need to buy two-faced
glitter glue also the one from lit
cosmetics is good but I don't actually
don't prefer that one over the over the
next one I think the Nixon the Too Faced
are definitely the best that I've tried
so this right here is just the the Too
Faced primer for now the regular primer
no glitter glue yet okay the strip is
calling me it's saying use me use me
it's not as punchy from the from the
swatches I thought it would be a little
more punchy but it's not it's um it's
very soft and it's definitely not patchy
at all I'm gonna go ahead and pop
undressed all over the lid that's an ice
cream sometimes when you get creams like
this they they're kind of sheer I like
really opaque cream shades so I
appreciate that
now we'll do a little bit of butt-naked
kind of deeper into the crease I'm just
gonna do kind of one of my traditional
not creative eye looks because I just
want to test the shadows today we'll get
more creative in the full review it
looks nice I have to say it looks nice
I'm gonna punch Nicki Nicki which is the
dark brown on the outer corner I liked
it there a little bit buildable they're
not weak and buildable they're like the
perfect level of buildable and I'm
telling you this genuinely look I know
there's gonna be people who don't like
Laura we're gonna call my video really
you know look for yourself I can't make
it up you constructive criticism Kelly's
now we're gonna go with the glitter glue
because I need jaybird in my life and I
know that's gonna look weird
with me sitting in my pajamas wearing
j-bert all over my eyeballs but I swatch
that thing and I went oh it's seriously
like when I first watched it reminded me
of a Pat McGrath shadow and Pat McGrath
shadows a room get guiltless ly
expensive way more expensive than these
I'm just gonna put that glitter glue all
over my lid one thing I do wish is that
I wish that Laura had a glitter glue
available on her site if it wasn't one
that she made maybe she could ask I mean
I know she knows Jared over at Too Faced
maybe she probably has connections over
it next maybe try to sell the next
glitter glue on her website or the Too
Faced glitter glue on her website I
don't know if that would be possible but
you know when when something requires
something I mean I don't know she said
you can use a wet brush as well but I
feel like you know if you need it in
order to use it you should probably have
it available for your customers on the
website if that's possible but I don't
know if it's possible or not all right
let's put J Bert I'm just gonna use my
fingertip because I'm scared of using a
brush and we're just gonna pop that
right there that seriously reminds me of
Pat McGrath no joke
holy moly it's very loose in the pan
just so you know
be very careful digging into it because
I can see if you dip a brush and a
really strong you're just gonna break it
it's pressed but it's still it's still
glitter you still got chunks now let's
do let me see if I can do a little bit
of this exposed on the inner corner just
to do something a little bit different
but the textures are different so I
don't know mmm I don't like that that
did not match very well know now that
it's blending it's kind of going
together there you go now that it's kind
of blending in it seems to be fine
initially it was a little bit weird but
the blend is making the difference I
mean I guess with the glitter glue thing
if she says you can use water I'll have
to see what it really someone's mowing
the lawn all right while he's mowing the
lawn I'm gonna do my brows real quick
okay it's kind of quiet now all right so
let's on the lower lash line let's do a
little bit of this buff shade why come
to me among the lawn right now okay I am
getting a little bit of transfer onto my
brow bone a little bit but again I'm
gonna have to play with these this is
just first impression okay so let's put
a little bit of Stark just on the inner
corner lower lashline
and I'm just gonna put a tiny bit of
undressed on my brow bone and then
actually I'm gonna wing this Nikki Nikki
out a little bit on the side I'm gonna
pull it out to make more of like a
triangular shape
I want it to be a soft triangle that I'm
not a harsh triangle so that's why I
wanted to use a softer brush alright I'm
gonna go ahead and pop on some a liner
and some mascara and I'll be back to
show you the way that it came out with
that sometimes they like it need that to
give it a finished look
alright so liner and mascara is on let
me go ahead and close my eyes and just
show you what I very quickly created
again I'm going to be playing with this
for the next week or two and then full
review will be up it does take me a
while because I like to make sure I'm
giving you the best information possible
let me go ahead and zoom you out for
final thoughts so final not final
thoughts first impression I am really
digging on this I have no complaints as
far as the shadows go except for that
I'm already seeing a little bit of
Fallout on j-bird on my cheek but I need
to play with it I need to figure out how
to get that not to happen and that's
what's gonna happen in the next couple
of weeks that's information hopefully
I'll be able to provide to you I'm gonna
try it with the NYX Glu Glu I'm gonna
try it with the lid I'm gonna I'm gonna
figure that shade out is it awful as far
as the fallout no it's not awful as of
now thank you so much for watching this
