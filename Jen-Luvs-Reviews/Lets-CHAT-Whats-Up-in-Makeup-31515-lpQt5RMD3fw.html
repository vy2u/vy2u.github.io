welcome to my second live chat I am so
excited to be talking with you I think
that I've got some things worked out
from last week so hopefully they work
out so if I am rambling for a little
while just know that i will tell you
down below what time to skip to because
the beginning might be a little boring
well I figure out what I'm doing and
making sure that everything is working
so there's a lot of features on here
that I'm not really sure about so it
might take me a second to figure things
out but I'm so excited about what's up
and make up this week 21 days a beauty
started today I haven't checked on Alta
to see whether today's deals are sold
out yet but they may not be sold out yet
so check it out if you are looking at 21
days of beauty if you wanted that thing
with bare minerals and philosophy is 10
knowledge for one of those blush face
thingies is pretty good deal all right
let me go and see if i can find that
says Q&amp;amp;A feature disabled okay i might
have to go back and do what i did last
time which was looking at my comments so
let me just go ahead and see if I can do
that mmm let's just start this YouTube
thing over again up a jet our the video
I'm not starting that ever again I'm
just trying to get to where I can see
what you all are saying and see if
anybody is here naw darlin oh Emily says
right on time you sure are girlfriend
I'm excited okay so let's see okay let's
see if I can see Emily's comment in the
actual video because that would be
awesome nope I can't rip chat why
wouldn't let me to it okay let me see if
I can for mines or is it says Q&amp;amp;A
feature to say what I don't want it to
be to say what I want it to be good
capture cameraman lose that control room
hmm it says eject any bad actors so
anybody's being me and I can eject them
that's so funny ok this is YouTube what
happens if i click that oh i don't know
if that was a good thing uh I don't
think I was supposed to do that I'm
cancelling out of that that that that
was not good okay I don't see oh I see
there's six people here hello my six
friends let's just go ahead and be
talking about makeup so um I know a
couple people were asking me already
what was my lips in the video that was
just what line it was in my March
Burke's birchbox and I'm so excited
about it Lisa like lasagna is so single
gorgeous ok I'm going to do with it I
pulled it out watch me have pulled it
out and then not know where I put it but
it's it's miran s your nests and it's
quite a glossy kiss I think oh my
goodness what is it yes ok this is it
this is what I was wearing on my lips in
the video and the latest what's my
makeup video so excited about that
swatch it for you another lighting isn't
my typical lighting but and you love my
real people background here look it's
like grandma's house back there and
there's my turtle I have a mom a desert
tortoise named 20 and she lives right
there so um but yeah that's the way that
looks watched and I just love the way
that came out with that shirt and
everything oh my goodness it's got a
little bit of a gold shimmer in the
background but it's so subtle you can
barely even see it just made my lips
look awesome I think I really love this
product I'm not saying it's my lips I'm
saying is the product that I really like
a lot and then this is the shade boom
perfect kiss I think it's number 14 so
very excited about that that was in my
March Birchbox and John and I are
supposed to be shooting the birchbox
Smackdown today with februari and March
we really didn't want to do two at the
same time but you know time just gets
away from you you know when you got work
you got kids and all that stuff all
right I got 13 viewers so let me go over
to me oh my goodness i'm still getting
the hang of this okay go over to the
column
alright i'm just going to do it the same
way i did it last time because i know
how it works okay all right one faithful
to him hi again I remember you from last
week well I member your comments too but
when Jen don't forget your be right back
side I know I know I didn't make one I
didn't make when I could make one though
I don't have to be right back though
because I'm shooting in a different
place what I've got all my mega but I
mean this is the opposite side of where
you usually see so like my um my
palettes are right here in front of me
and I've got my to Alec stores here and
then my nail polish is over here so this
is like an opposite angle so it might
not have to do the be right back side
unless for some reason I have something
like in the bathroom I have to go bad or
something okay McKenzie says good
morning good morning Mackenzie good
morning Sarah good morning yarra yarra
yarra yarra please tell me what because
I'm gonna say it right um Mia hi Jen
California omnia got up early for me in
California Thank You meal it's good to
see you Mia okay let's see what else we
got going on I know right like look at
this like I got knickknacks knickknacks
no it's not Nick next it's my my jewelry
stand it's like a little bird thing I
got it from little black bag if
anybody's like old-school remembers
little black bag I still miss it like
all the time I think about it every once
in a while a little black bag but but I
got my jewelry stuff in there and then
all my perfumes are up there but it's
like you know nobody ever I don't like
people over that often so it's like I
don't care whether my perfumes look
perfect you know like one day when I'm
rich Yeah right one day I'll have a
beauty room like a lot of you will do
but that would be nice but I don't see
that happening anytime soon okay Emily
what are some good under eye concealers
for dark under eyes the garden a
rollerball doesn't work for me okay I've
never tried that but i'll show you the
ones that i like hey these actually
honestly this one is awesome I really
think you let this one this one is
called time bomb by the bomb and it is
fab and I've had it for a while but man
this stuff is awesome okay so you see if
I can find something to conceal okay
here's a freckle hopefully you can see
that cuz I can't see myself and you see
how it just went away it's like gone of
course this isn't the right skin tone
for from my arm but I mean it definitely
well it's faded
if you guys can see that but it looks
better i'm a face that doesn't offer but
anyway you might be able to get to get
the point but this stuff he is amazing
time bomb concealer by the bong this is
the other one if you're looking for
something that's a little more
accessible Nick's dark snork a bit
Nick's dark circle concealer I got this
from my friendly she when she went to
the Knicks party last year but this is
not nearly as thick so it's a little bit
greasy ur so maybe not that one oh let's
see any other ones this is one that I've
recently become in love with if you want
something a little more accessible I
don't know if you've ever tried this one
this is the it's an age rewind for dark
circles this one's really nice and if I
have another freckle I can cover it
let's say it's still not as good as the
bone was one I mean that's not even
covering up my freckle so I've never
covered freckles with my dark circles so
I'm learning something new with you so
so far in my freckle test the bombs time
bomb is definitely blowing all of them
away so of all the ones i have that's
the one that i recommend they should be
coming up on whole look look in the next
month or two they come up with out every
three to four months so should be soon
to get those that half price all right
let me go back to comments refresh
shuffle e that answer your question
Emily alright hi from Australia get hi
Lauren good to see you again and Monique
from Belgium hi Monique and I've been
waiting and I don't know how to tie I
think Kylie I'm just gonna call you cry
my beauty she's just about to start a
YouTube channel she's been playing
around with videos I saw like the
beginning of your video you sent me but
it didn't watch the whole thing yet but
I did see it and you were on your laptop
and it was kind of pointing upward and I
totally saw the beginning of it and she
says got my cereal my cat we're good to
go what's up and make up a lot sup and
makeup every week there's a lot of
makeup I mean part of the reason why
there's so much up in makeup is because
there's so many makeup brands it's just
ridiculous all right Nia says i've
subscribed to quite a few beauty boxes
because of your reviews hopefully it
went well for you there's sort of a
gateway drug of monthly beauty box I
know right yeah I know I know but I'm
chilling out on my beauty box videos so
maybe that would be better for you it
says 1 i've not heard you mention this
GlossyBox any pains okay glossybox i
have heard fantastic things about gloomy
ebonics honestly the only reason why i
had a glossy gotten GlossyBox is because
i would be way too many subscription
boxes I don't need another subscription
books they haven't contacted me to send
me any 4 promo I know that sounds lame
but it's like I don't need another one
so if not i don't wanna pay thirty
dollars or whatever cause like twenty
dollars for something that I don't need
um because I give so many products at
this point especially from my beauty
boxes so it's kind of going down on the
priority list getting GlossyBox but the
box openings that I see are fantastic
and if I were to get another one of
another subscription box it would either
be GlossyBox or popsugar must have those
would be the next ones I would want to
try so maybe one day in the future
John's like John's plane in there I
can't keep them completely by their kids
they live in the house so you know
whatever um but yeah definitely positive
opinions of what I've seen of glossy box
so far but i don't know if i'll be
getting at any time soon alright let's
see what's next good morning Holly
Holly's one of my what's of the makeup
reporter she does Mac for me so she's
amazing and I never have to like worry
about Holly Holly's amazing she's
fantastic um I love what Holly said when
she first took I when I asked her first
to help with what to put makeup she was
like I asked her she wanted to Mac or I
think Alta she's like all T Mac because
I don't know as much about Mac and I
want to learn about Mac so I'm gonna do
Mac and I just thought that was amazing
machine like didn't pick the one she
knew the best you picked the one she
knew the least she could learn more I
just thought that was awesome so good
morning Holly Robin bridges Jen any idea
when the launch of the new kat von d i
shut up how it will be cat said april
that's all I know that's all Kat said
and support hasn't said anything so
April and I had talked to her personally

see reviews for people that do have at
me I just feel like you know unless I
have that problem there's no point in me
trying it but but I am really curious to
see whether that's going to work with
some of my friends that do have acne I
could say some names of people that I'm
thinking of off the top my head but I
don't want to make them feel awkward
like oh by the way my friend has acne
and her name is like um Olivia good

i know i love 21 days of beauty let's
see it doesn't seem like they have like
really really great things that i'm
super excited about this time no I mean
there's good stuff but nothing that I'm
like really said about there's a live
rock palette that looks interesting it's
coming later in the month better than
that I'm not like super wowed by the
deals all right oh it's a lot of makeup
girl rocks I did a collaboration with

that would be like we are on the same
page there I love to pick up that one of
the ender Selecao the interstellar
palette is nice like I really like the
interstellar palette but honestly if I
had to choose between this one and the
new one I would probably pick the new
one just because I mean this one's good
but that one looks amazing like it looks
like some whole nother level alright
Lori hi Lori um and Susan's here hi Jen
Lori says hi from South Carolina says hi
Lori um love what's up and makeup today
thank you hot naughty I know the things
they just come out when I'm just trying
to film Birchbox map down Oh John I are
supposed to be filling it filming it
today it's just it's hard to coordinate
us with the kids and it's been really
really cold out so we haven't been able
to like make the kids go putting up make
them but tell him hey go play outside
for a lil while when mommy and daddy
film like it just hasn't been happening
and it's Ben's really cold lately so now
it's warmed up a bit I think after the
gym today we we're gonna we're going to
film two months worth wolf won't film
februari and we'll film March but the
problem is is we end up talking too much
and bit about and the next thing we know
it's a 40 minute video so thankfully he
edits that one for people but yes that
should be coming and if you haven't seen
if you're a new subscriber if you
haven't seen my husband eyes birchbark
smackdowns honestly they're selling my
favorite videos because John is
hilarious and we just always get in this
chatter back and forth and we just we
just have a lot of fun together so stay
tuned for that and that high in that
good morning and lunch at what she's
getting her coupons ready today for sure
TV that's all hi from Miami oh my
goodness my family um if you like
couponing go to a 192 point oh she does
a lot of those kinds of views but she
also does like influenster and she does
a lot of reviews like makeup refuse and
stuff like that and that's been a good
friend of mine on youtube for a very
long time so highly recommend her
channel a 190
two point oh susan w hi Susan sees is
another one of my reporters from what's
up and makeup she does QVC nothing
really big and QVC she's going to start
covering some HSN stuff for me to which
I'm so excited about okay what are you
most excited about coming out for the
spring makeup I see the thing is
probably the kat von d the shade + light
eye shadow palette is the thing that's
coming up then I'm most excited about
but like things that I like attracted to
visually like that we talked about this
week was that do your blush I think he
looked so pretty but things I'm trusting
or anymore because I got that one
Christmas panel nothing was a hot the
junk and was like this is supposed to be
dealer like really and truly like I
remember talking to Lily when lily and I
Stu first started hanging out Lily
Spurgeon who's also one of the reporters
we just we started talking I'm hanging
out hanging out through email but we had
just started talking online about the
Dior palette and how it was just a mess
it was powdery and it didn't blend well
and it was just a piece of junk like
this is supposed to be or so I've always
I know I just repeated myself I can't
edit it out um so I don't trust your as
much as I did so but the blush is
beautiful but you like the flux that
blushes gorgeous so as far as other
things coming out and make up that are
new honestly I can't eat anything that
I'm super excited about except for that
I'm interested to try the hard candy
stuff that we talked about this week for
a lot of really good things that now
there's two people that I've seen that I
really like those hard getting blushes
so I'll probably go to walmart and pick
one or two of those up because those are
very intriguing to me like I need
another blush but they're intriguing so
hopefully that answers your question
Susan okay um let's say good Tim oh is
it not sorting by the newest know it is
they're just getting mixed up because
some of these I've seen before oh I hope
I don't miss anybody cuz it looks like
the comments are getting mixed up okay
Melissa hi melissa melissa is one of my
favorite review channels oh my goodness
melissa rodriguez oh no she's not in the
chat hopefully she comes by the chat she
just comment on what some makeup melissa
rodriguez you have to watch her channel
like seriously some of the best reviews
she's like
and out concise in and out totally
underrated like needs more subscribers
like people did not and she needs more
subscribers because that's not really
what I want to say she needs more people
to know that she exists so that they can
enjoy our videos excellent reviews
melissa rodriguez you gotta look her up
um so she's going to do a review of the
heart kidney blushes she says on
whatsapp in makeup nice uh oh favorite
lip balm + gloss ooh + gloss gotta go to
conjure up like so this is this is nice
being over here even though it's an ugly
background at least I get to show you
where balm + gloss hmm favorite blunt
bones and not favorite glosses but I
don't know about balm + laws of the
glossy bomb boom boom I don't know about
that when I show you my favorite gloss
in my favorite bone that's all I got um
these are really nice these are by treat
beauty and this is called coconut cream
of these giants this one I haven't used
much the one that I use a lot is ever by
my bed I'm not going to get that but but
I really like this brand a lot as soon
as I've been online me show you when
they don't like that i think what John
really liked this one this is the call
to leave bomb I just think that it's
overpriced like I mean it's nice but
it's nothing cuddly you know I shouldn't
say that word hopefully nobody's
watching it's a child okay the sugar
rooms that's probably I guess we could
say any of these sugar rose um I love
these I didn't like them at first
because i only had the Rose one but then
I got look this is how lame i am I still
kept the Christmas set and like how they
are oh I'm missing one but i love these
these are awesome of course you can't
get this because this was Christmas but
i love these things these things are
awesome so i don't know if that answer
your question as far as a gloss + bone a
bum + applause you see because it's like
Bo me and glossy oh no what I do have
something now that I'm thinking about
it's another one you can only get online
know so I mean but if you have urged box
points you can get with marsh box points
where are they okay here's one these um
Lakha and company lip lubes these things
are amazing this one's got they have a
lot of color but they are so
moisturizing they are so fantastic I
don't know if you can see the shine on
it but these things are awesome these um
especially the lip lubes they do have
the other kind to that are really nice
these are the little lips these are nice
too but they're not quite as balmy as
the whip lubes so I've actually got this
in a Birchbox and then I ended up
getting more because they were so
amazing okay let's see hello Susan again
I don't know if that was out of order
though okay hi sarah says who truly
needs a beauty box nobody really needs a
beauty buck I like them too but it's
like you know I'm getting kind of
overloaded products and it's getting a
little overwhelming because I'm trying
to store everything and I have such a
small house like one day when my house
is relatively clean I'll do like a house
source you can see like how small my
house my house is tiny like my bedroom
that you're unfilmable min is actually
the dining room it's supposed to be the
dining room so I've got my bed here
there's a window a dresser there's this
junk back here and then there's this
open door space that leans out into the
living room okay in the living room goes
into the kitchen where I filmed last
week and then the kitchen goes there's
two doors on either side and one goes
into John's little Jones bedroom and one
goes into Lila's bedroom then the door
that goes in the LYLAS bedroom into a
little Jones bedroom then you turn and
you go into the bathroom and that's my
whole house and that's the entire house
it's super super super small so as far
as getting beauty boxes and makeup and
all myself it's like I need to do like a
serious cleanse I think for the end of
the school year i think i'm going to do
like videos or whatever like i know a
lot of people doing like the
decluttering videos micro on jessica
over Jen beauty 89 is been doing a lot
of decluttering videos and they're also
but like just take out stuff that i'm
not using an just bring it to work in a
bag and just give them to my 4th grade
team just give them to them because i've
got to get rid of some stuff
and a lot of it is the stuff that i get
from Beauty boxes it's not stuff that
I'm purchasing stuff that I'm getting
from the beauty box beauty the booty
boxes the beauty box is some of the
people well I guess I'm purchasing some
of its I do buy some of my beauty boxes
but still that was long okay um uh huh
it's Holly your alma some Holly just
said she's blushing Holly you're awesome
I'm I'm not going to end it I'm just
gonna say it you're awesome okay Jamie
good morning Jen just went to shoving
olds oh I already read that one why
don't why am i giving the same comments
okay when you refresh again okay okay
here's some new stuff well lots of new
stuff something must have happened last
time hit refresh because now I've got a
ton of new stuff okay okay and that
wants to know if I've tried the new
physicians formula argan where BB cream
no she said she used it today and so far
it's good it's lightweight natural
looking cool that's good to know so
there you go and that says that the
argument BB cream is pretty decent cool
Marianne is watching from England oh I
want to go back to England one day um do
you find it as annoys me the delays and
products for different countries oh I
know it's so weird I'm sure it's worse
for you than it is for us like the UK so
for me I know and it's movies too i
think that you guys get like american
movies a lot later but yeah i don't i
don't feel it probably as much as you do
but i do wish we could all get at the
same time i don't understand why i guess
maybe it just takes longer to produce
like a mass amount of stuff so they have
to choose where they want to release it
so like you know um celeb rimmel release
it in UK first and then we have to wait
mmm which I'll probably feel it worse I
know my friend Australia knows what
you're talking about because I know that
takes them forever to get stuff alright
Sarah Sarah says that our
eleven-year-old daughter at a sleepover
last night and resulted in drama and
guess what the job was about makeup off
between tween drama I am NOT looking for
Delilah being a tween and a teenager oh
my gosh she's gonna be a mess she's just
she's so like intense
she's been intense and she was born so
that intensity I'm just curious see how
that's going to translate to when she's
a teenager all right I am I can't say
I'm not looking forward to her being a
teenager just because I you know I feel
like that's ungrateful you know like I
I'm looking forward to watching her grow
but that time I think is going to be
very difficult and challenging let me
put it that way alright cool girl 1 2 3
what is a good DIY lip stain or good
drugstore lip stain well the only DIY
lip stain I did was the one the kool-aid
one and it did not come out good at all
um drugstore lips stinging I don't think
I have any drugstore lip stains so this
is the thing I get so many things from
beauty boxes and stuff that I don't go
and buy a lot of stuff the drugstore
they say that sounds lame but it's like
I'm like overloaded with beauty box
stuff oh thanks to a lip stain and the
guy how many drugs wanna see the I did
tried I could tell you the elf one is
very bad I did try the elf lip stain and
I hated it I'm the one that's like a pen
oh it was awful it really was like
drawing with marker on my lips so skip
that one but honestly I don't have a
good one I'm sorry oh I feel bad i hate
when I don't have the answer sorry okay
Mackenzie have you heard anything about
the drama with lime crime I had a
feeling that was going to come up
eventually yes I have ok if you don't
know lime crime has a really bad
reputation right now um I'm not going to
go into everything because I don't have
like it written in front of me but if
you look up lime crime drama or a lime
crime um what is it or if you look up
what's her name the the creator of lime
crime like she has right now not a good
reputation for tree near customers back
well basically what happened is that
their website was hacked and a bunch of
credit card numbers were stolen and
people had a lot of things charged to
their cards and like this one bro
supposedly like something about how she
got to our thousands of dollars you
could play pay for a college or
something please don't quote me on this
because this is my memory I'm not
reading it off of anything so it could
be wrong on the details but basically a
lot of people got the credit card stuff
stolen and that they supposedly you were
trying to tell them from october i think
that they were getting credit card in
for
their credit information was compromised
they thought it was from lime crime but
they didn't do anything until like
january or februari and then they
finally made this huge announcement and
yes has been compromised or whatever but
if you look back in lime crime drama
there's been lying crime drama for a
really long time like supposedly the
owner of lime crime like called people
who buy lime crime make up stupid
basically four-by-four spending so much
money on her makeup like because it's so
you know if you're dumb enough to pay
this much for a lipstick like something
like that like really bad on social
media so honestly like I don't my only
reaction as far as that is I never plan
on buying from lime crime anyway because
their style is not my style that's very
bold it's very bright it's not really my
thing the only live crab thing that I
own is this as just this the open ocean
and I actually really like this nail
polish and this what I got in a beauty
box and I love it it's a fantastic nail
polish so I was considering buying some
more lime crime stuff from IMATS last
year and they didn't have any nail
polish and the line was like two hours
long so we just wasn't worth it to me so
I was thinking about this year buying
some lime crime nail polish I don't
think that I will it's not that I'm
boycotting them it's just it's not worth
it to me you know like I don't know it's
not that fantastic so I don't know I I
mean when it comes down to it I probably
never would have purchased anything from
them anyway so it doesn't really apply
to me is that a cop out but I mean you
know how I am as far as making sure to
treat people well and it sounds like
they don't really treat people well they
have a history of not treating people
well so I think that's kind of bad for
business ooh okay so hopefully I
answered that enough but yeah if you
want to look up the actual real details
of that situation definitely google it
don't take my word for exactly what
happened um Holly says she's excited for
Laran talent and the two face sweetheart
blushes yes those are i forgot that
those are coming on the 21 days of
beauty the yep and then sarah says she's
excited about this deal of smudge sticks
yeah those are really nice I did get one
of those a very long time ago on
hautelook and it really liked it a lot
let's see for the level organized
one of my favorite videos every week oh
that's one what's up and make up okay
she's not here okay Christine good
morning Jan so happy to hang out with
you again happy to hang out with you
again too um she didn't comment last
week okay I didn't think I remembered
you I was like a kind of Ella sure if
you saw my hesitation like I don't
member your name from last week but I do
I think have you ever commented on my
videos before because it doesn't your
name doesn't look like your picture
looks familiar but your name doesn't
look familiar do you change your name
and how to wear a bold red lip and keep
the line crisp she uses a lip liner and
even a brush to apply the color but
always feels like it looks messy or
smudges outside the line quickly one
thing that I do well I mean yeah I mean
I I'm definitely not a bold lip kind of
person so I don't have a lot of
experience with it and really I use I
use a lip liner and like I hi where's my
it's here it might be my gym bag what's
my laser pencil maybe my gym bag I'm
happy to Grandma general because I'm
like a positive it'll scare the bears
why it looks like this it's not this it
looks kind of like this it's by Lord and
Barry there's a it's like a clear lip
liner I really like that one a lot and I
can use it with anything so I really
like that I find a really dry lip pencil
helps more than a more moist slit pencil
but then my lips feel like they're gonna
dry out so it's kind of like a give take
on that that really like lip pencils
that's the only thing like the only way
um I've heard of people tried to put
concealer or foundation like right here
and that kind of helps some like put put
concealer foundation on your lips you
don't really have to like be careful
with it because you don't cover up with
lipstick anyway but just like putting a
little bit like on the edges and that
can kind of help with the feathering I
don't know try it and let me know I've
heard that I have never tried that so
except for when I sometimes i'm just
lazy and just put foundational liver my
lips not only have a lot of problem with
my red lipsticks my dark lipsticks
bleeding out a whole lot yet okay
hopefully that was helpful Tracy I Jen
do you know when the two-phase sugar pop
out will be coming out no no idea no I
don't know
but i'll let you know and what does it
make of what I do Judy says hi from
Canada hi to Canada lovely Fox morning
Jen from Ken another Canada I my passion
and dedication to your makeup news
channel it's really cool it's hard
sometimes to keep going with it because
it's it is a lot of work but i love it i
love the final product and it makes it
so worth it my new product of the week
has to be my audacious lipstick I don't
keep up with new releases I wait for
reviews it's my precious yeah I think
that's the smart thing to do is to wait
for the reviews before buying something
because then you really know when you
have to worry about returning stuff or
not being able to return things I think
that's smart all right we're in the
30-minute in mark so I do have to go at
UM at eleven o'clock because I'm one of
the gym with my family so I have to cut
it at eleven this morning all right
let's see all right here coming oh I'm
not gonna try it so it's okay heavy
heart Jones says I have you heard
anything to smooth out crepey lids so
shadow will go on smoother she's a
primer but it doesn't decrease the
wrinkles Oh mom and teen daughter
obsessed here okay smoothing out creepy
lids I think there's only so much that
we can do my eyelids of course are not
super creepy yet but they're getting
there I think there's only so much we
can do I mean I really like my are you I
really like this my Urban Decay the
anti-aging primer but I would suggest
getting a sample from Sephora before you
buy it if you have a sephora near you
because I've heard that this doesn't
work well for everybody so I'm not going
to like recommend this wholeheartedly
because i'm not positive that this is
going to be an awesome one as far as
smoothing out the creepiness because i
think it wants your I want your I mean I
hate to be not give you hope but I mean
you can't really do anything about the
texture I'm just like good eye creams to
try to like um oh that's a good idea the
tart eye cream that I've been using
lately I actually really like I got a
sample and a sephora something was a
support / the um it's like a little tiny
jar that I got a sample of and I feel
like it's definitely
tightening up my eyelids so maybe
something like that like a good eye
cream would help to kind of firm up that
skin but as far as I primer I don't know
of any that I could say for a hundred
percent will definitely work so um oh it
just says anything to smooth out crepey
lids um yeah just um try to try to find
an eye cream that works for you get
samples it's a four before you buy them
things like that but yeah bittar it when
I would start there with the tart one
all right Melissa McCracken warning of
question yay i bought the hourglass
ambient lighting bluff profile I don't
really care for it I don't like it
either Susan if you're still here I know
I know my friend Susan WI she loves the
ambient lighting blush palette I
returned mine I didn't really like it
either or I I is a trick to using a
design one else feel this way hey Susan
if you are here ok if you're still here
Susan you've got to tell her how to use
how you use your ambient lighting blush
palette my name is Melissa McCracken
scroll down and click and reply to her
or comment and I will say what you say
because honestly like the pigmentation
isn't super there and it's got that glow
that the ambient lighting highlighting
palette has but it's just that I didn't
wow me it was a good blush a good solid
blush but didn't Wow me to the point of
like feeling like I needed to pay that
for it you know so I returned mine so
hopefully Susan can help you Melissa

awesome all right Emily what kind of
watch where the Maybelline blush nudes
palette me too me too um who did I see
um Maria over at Beauty two-shoes I just
got a weird number of o's and Z's but
Beauty two-shoes is her youtube name and
also her Instagram she just put up some
um that she got those so I'm hoping that
her real will review them but that blush
nude palette looks amazing and
supposedly it measures up pretty well to
the naked 3 palette so excited about
that me too Francis what do you think of
the new NARS blush is ok alright I'm
going to go into the more i have like
getting ready with me tutorial ish kind
of a video that i did using these last
week and it's taken me forever to edit
that thing oh my goodness is like
torture it's like Chinese water torture
dripping on my head editing that video I
just
not having fun editing it but I'll tell
you okay so I got these two this one is
an adoration and then I got this one in
fervor ok so I like them differently ok
so this one in adoration this one is so
bright it's like crazy it's it's it's
bright um this one I used right and it
still doesn't seem too well yeah I mean
it's just I use a dry and it's still
it's crazy this is a crazy blush this is
a gorgeous highlight though I don't see
myself using this one that much but this
highly i've been using every day and i
love it this one is so pretty much a
good swatch hopefully you can see this
stuff because i can't really I can't see
what I'm doing so all i see is comments
it from me ok and then next up this one
this one i use wet I knew I have to use
this wet because it does not show up
unless I use it wet you can see it in
the swatches but you can't see it on my
cheeks this one here especially wet you
know somebody who was it somebody I
forget was somebody had sent me to their
blog and that blog linked Manny mua's
review of these and he said to spray the
palette instead of the brush I tried
that and I hated the way that look I've
been spraying my brush with where is it
this this that I got in a new Beauty
test tube along time ago I've been
spraying my brush with this and then
putting it in the product and it's
working out perfectly and I love this
blush like that it goes on kind of like
a cream blush when I do that and i love
it uh I'm not well you know what I was
thinking about taking them back it's
been going back and forth of my mind and
I haven't articulated it but I've been
going back and forth about whether i'm
going to keep these and i think that i
am going to keep them just because of
this because of the highlight and this
one really is beautiful wet so um yeah i
mean overall these are a window i think
there must have absolutely not they're
not a must have but they're there I do
like them I am enjoying them alright
that was a great question that was a
great question Francis all right Susan
says have you seen that clean neat came
out with new colors and their flower pot
blushes I did see that I saw that
yesterday after I'd already filmed and
they're great blushes gorgeous six new
coach I got
one of them and I returned it we don't
have the same taste in blush Susan
learning this because I couldn't get
pigmentation of it I just couldn't and I
know a lot of people love those
hourglass busters I don't like people
love those color pop look I brought the
flower pop couldn't blushes I just
couldn't I couldn't get into it maybe it
was just that one I think I've got the
peach pop one maybe I don't know i
remember it was like peachy colored and
I didn't like it it was beautiful but I
ended up returning it but you know I
mean I think it might have just been
that one because I've heard way too many
good things from way too many people
that I trust that it has to be me and
ask me that's the only way that I can I
can say it has to be me I don't like
them but i have seen them they look
gorgeous absolutely worst they'll be in
what's up make up next week all right
alana says she loves you too a clap
video for interested we'll talk soon I
know and this is the thing about cloud
videos okay I am drowning in my own
videos and I'm supposed to do a club
with michelle from gland moms at the end
of this month and like I have like four
or five other people that I want to
collab with and it's like I would love
to clout with you Alana Alana you're
amazing i love you you know i love you
but it's like I'm drowning in my own
videos I have a list of like eight or
nine videos that I need to film and it's
like you know I've got new baby
test-tube I've got this new one boo i
want to show you this oh my gosh i'm
gonna do a full video on this this
subscription is called choy and i know
this is off topic alone oh and she said
do you want to pick up anything 21 days
of beauty besides all the rock palette
now i'm mentioning it the two face blush
will finish answering your question
before i show you Troy um but that to
face blush looks amazing too i don't
know them actually going to get the
lorac pilot or the two face blush but
those are the most intriguing to me so
I've answered that okay um oh and then
we'll answer the next one um Severn Luna
is the Beca starter kit still also I'm
pretty sure it is because last time I
checked which was Thursday it was so I'm
thinking it should be okay so we'll hold
off Carly's got the next question but
i'm gonna i want to show you this this
is called Choi if you are have some cash
to throw around kids twenty dollars a
month I'm going to do a full video on
this but this is trying high-end
products how cool is that okay there are
very small samples okay they come
they're very small this is not where
you're going to get a huge
value but if you've always wanted to try
something and you can't you you want try
and you can't you don't want to buy the
full size and this is how you do it so
this oh my gosh so you can see that the
samples are very small they sent me
Smashbox mascara in black and it doesn't
say which one it just says Smashbox
mascara so I'm not quite sure but this
oh my goodness this is the Kevin a qualm
on lip gloss and blood roses I'm gonna
do a full review I'm not gonna swatching
it but amazing they also sent me a
sample of the hourglass ambient lighting
powder in radiant lighting and this is
how it looks inside they just give you
just enough to try and then this one is
the body brown metallic eyeshadow and
cognac and that's how that looks in sign
and then the ellis faas creamy eyes
eyeshadow and there's that one there so
this was this is twenty dollars ok this
is 20 oz but then if you like something
they give you ten dollars off in their
store but it's only for that month so I
mean there's a lot of things that are
that I'm going to get into more when I
do the full review but definitely check
out Troy if you um if you really want to
try some high end makeup on but don't
want to pay for it and before you get it
like I never want to try that chemical
want lip gloss and now i feel like i
want to buy every heaven upon lip gloss
that ever existed because I'm that
impressed by it um but yeah I wanted to
show you that because I'm excited about
it I know that that was totally off
topic but I really want to show you that
because I'm super excited moving on
alright 1044 mmm okay all right Holly
you ever tried have you tried the new
hard candy palette to know just from
jail Oh from jam beauty night if you
want to Jess from jammu 89 you need to
go over there because she's amazing she
started subscribe to my channel she had
like twelve hundred subscribers when she
subscribe my channel and now she's got
like 78,000 my cursive channel just blew
up I'm jealous no just kidding I I am
jealous no I'm not kidding i am jealous
a justice channel blew up so I mean I'm
very happy for her but I'm so jealous
but I love Jess she's amazing she
deserves everything that
to get she truly does she's a wonderful
person she did a chat because she saw my
chat she did chat and she said that she
got the idea from me which I thought was
really cool um but yeah she was saying
like the reason why she got into YouTube
videos I'm going off topic again is
because she was so tired of people like
commercials and people that she felt
like she couldn't trust them anymore and
she just wanted to have like a super
honest channel like and that's just her
and I just I love her and love her just
a jam beauty 18 I just amazing she did a
review of one of them it's almost exact
dude for the to face palette no way all
right I have to go back and watch that I
don't think I saw that video from jess I
think about somehow i missed it I don't
know Thank You Holly though okay um
wrist loves beauty hello from Rhode
Island da love watching channel thank
you what's up and make up such a good
idea thank you I was wondering if you
could do some more getting ready with me
it's not a tutorial because I know you
say you're in a makeup artist but just a
Chavez while you get ready i really want
to like that's where i want my channel
to go is more videos like that
absolutely holy grail foundation
drugstore and high-end alright i have
normal skin so you got to take that into
consideration okay high-end hourglass
immaculate liquid powder foundation and
my shade is in nude i love this stuff
it's a little bit hi buddy mama mmm came
oh yeah that was why you found my snack
but i was eating last night you did are
you eating him what you can eat one and
gave some to your sister because that
was mall most awful leaving them on the
table some of your sister thank you okay
all right I'm gonna throw stuff at my
friends only got about 50 minutes left
okay all right I love skittles on the
table last night I forgot to eat the
rest of them I was editing and I was
tired and you know all right anyway this
is my favorite unfortunately it's a
little dark for my skin tone but once I
once I self-tan a little bit get a
little you know closer to summer it will
probably match me pretty well but i love
the liquid the powder of this i love
liquid to powder and then for drug store
the matte and poreless from the
maybelline fit me I know this isn't
one but really and truly this is the
best drugstore foundation I've ever
tried you could totally convinced me
that this was a high-end foundation but
it's not I mean honestly I would believe
you if you put this image in a bottle
and said try this and tell me how much
you would pay for this I would pay a
high in price for this it's fantastic so
definitely those two are ma fades up
right now those are the ones i'm really
into ok um ok Amelia says I can't figure
where the question part is you're doing
it yeah the Amelia you did it I can't
figure out how you do all that any
either so I'm just checking your
comments Oh guy says hello just realize
it's live here yeah yoga love your
videos what's up at makeup series thank
you so much hugs from the UK I know I
bet it's very cold there oh my goodness
I have a good friend that lives in I in
England and he keeps me updated on me on
the weather and everything there hi
Jennifer Gonzalez good morning Jen what
primer do you recommend for an oily acne
prone skin trying to find a good one new
sub love your videos from New York okay
this is the thing I said this last week
two is because i don't have oily acne
prone skin I don't have as much fun as
much experience with that like some of
the makeup artists the people that work
with people of different skin tones are
better at that stuff than i am but um as
far as oily acne from last week it was
it was dry so oily acne prone girlfriend
because this is the thing is I don't
want to clog your pores I don't want to
give you some tell you something and
then have a clog your pores and I don't
have enough background knowledge as far
as like silicones and things like that
and how it affects acne prone skin so
I'm not going to recommend anything
because i'm scared i'm going to
recommend something bad and I don't want
to recommend something that makes you
break out so I could sit here and I
could guess I could say some silicone
ones that I think are good but I don't
know if that's gonna mess with you so
I'm just not gonna I'm not going to
answer it because I don't want to do
something bad and you're trusting me and
I'm not going to tell you something
that's that I'd not one hundred percent
sure I'm sorry okay Micah like I think I
said that right hi Jen if you tried a
new benefit roller lash yes BAM ok this
is in the the tutorial ish thing that
getting ready with me review video that
I film that I can't get through this is
pretty awesome in my opinion it's got
its ups and downs okay many review
um okay lengthening is amazing
volumizing is named clumping is man but
lengthening is awesome the other thing
is is it stays kind of wet so you kind
of have to like it's it's always tacky
and it's also very heavy but lengthening
is amazing i agree with you for length
if you already have lots of lashes this
is going to be a fabulous mascara for
you as long as you don't mind the weight
of it um but yes I got this with
birchbox points Oh was very excited I
like pre-ordered it and everything so
I'm so excited about I think it's a
packaging benefit always gets me on the
packaging alright I'm going to hit
refresh got ten minutes left I know I'm
probably not going to get to everybody
and I'm sorry but I want to do another
one of these next weekend so if i don't
get your question come back next weekend
okay oh my goodness okay I'm Way behind
I'm so sorry okay so if you have an
asset question yet I probably wouldn't
get to it it can't hurt to ask it
because I might be able to answer it
just typing later but all right okay I
gotta go about okay I feel like I'm not
even far enough back okay oh there we go
okay sounds it alright Alyssa yay
another chat Lucky's what could oh I
missed the one from Michael what's your
favorite highlighting concealer for very
fair-skinned got back I don't have very
fair skin but I'll tell you I really
love this one this is the Estee Lauder
Double Wear brush on glow I really
really like this as a highlighting um is
it a highlighting concealer is that what
she wanted yeah highlighting concealer
it doesn't conceal that great but it's a
beautiful highlighter another one that I
really like is this one this is the
tarina tarantino one I got this in a
beauty no in a boxy charm and this one
is in the shade it's got an I dream
hyperlite under eye brightener this one
I feel like conceals more than this one
but I like them both and this one I've
mine in light medium of course you would
get like but yes to those i really like
those
um let's say and you can always get like
a 1 guess if you have really light skin
it's going to be hard to find one that's
lighter than your skin tone that doesn't
make sense that would make that I was
going to say get one later that's a
concealer later than your skin tone but
there probably won't be want to fear
that fair Alexis how do you store all of
your makeup I have drawers everywhere I
have to Alex drawers here on the eight
ones and then I have one two three four
five were here that that's where I store
everything and then I've also got some

something a little more
I add I know that this is a foundation
but this buxom showed me some skin
weightless foundation is pretty much
like a BB cream it's very very light

premature that's what I would recommend
okay uh let's see Genevieve tried any
polish toys skincare products no Judy

go crazy and I'm scared I have a
published choice little sample but I
have not tried I could look like right
here it's right here okay it's sitting
right in the front and I'm scared to try
it because sometimes my subscribers my
friends here on YouTube excuse me i'm
like i can't i can't i miss letting that

that um I wasn't sure if I was going to
get one on but this is a BAM this is a
face card this is the best face powder
I've ever used in my entire life it is
amazing and it's quote the brand is
called makeup helper and um it's a
Korean makeup and oh I wish they would
sell using United States because I would
definitely repurchase um and I I need to
