up the makeup chat okay so I have some
technical difficulties that I have to
work out i think i have to Chad's going
right now so i have to go tell the other
chat that the islands not working and
they need to come over here so i will
put a skip ahead button down below let's
skip ahead but i'll tell you what time
to skip to so that you can know what is
happening i try to do it a different way
and now i am i'm having some trouble so
let me let me just go into the other
room hi everyone exit out of this chat
and go to the new one this one one is
not working oh ok let me see what's
happening i'm so sorry I'm still trying
to figure this stuff out and it's being
a pain in the tush so let me see what's
happening as far as what videos what's
happening on i'm at let's see live
events okay it says live now so i think
i think i might have gotten everybody
over here i hope because it says well I
might let me go to the upcoming ones
yeah this one I need to to tell people
okay so this one is the wrong one so I
need to tell people okay I try to do
something different and I made a mistake
this is the wrong chat exit out and go
back to my channel you should see the
live on there sorry about that still
learning smiley face Save Changes oh I
can't believe I did that oh my goodness
Oh
well there's nothing I can do about it
now now I learned don't go in that way
youtube has things set up so strangely
of different ways to do things and I was
trying to get it started ahead of time
but it didn't work so anyway let's see
if I can just go in hopefully we didn't
lose too many people by me doing that
that really stinks cuz i broadcast that
to a bunch of people and now i'm upset
about that all right now I can't find
you where are you my friends where did
you go there you are okay hello my
friends welcome to the what's up and
make up chat I am so excited so here's
the deal with me what's up and make up
chat um you with basically what's been
happening is that you guys are asking me
questions and then I'm trying to answer
them and then you all try to answer each
other so go down in the comments of the
video and see what else hmm see what
people are asking and feel free to
answer them as well because honestly I
feel like you all have just as much
knowledge about makeup sometimes a lot
more not much about makeup than I do so
we can all help each other and we can
get to know each other we can kind of
make this like a makeup club you know
where we all meet every Sunday and just
so you know next Sunday and the sunday
after there won't be chats though
because next Sunday is Easter Sunday and
Sunday after that I'll be i'm at to New
York so I just don't want to mess with
all of that and I'm at so this will be
the last chat we'll have to take two
weeks off and then we'll come back for a
chat the following week so let me go
ahead and see if I can refresh the
comments I am so upset about this oh my
goodness okay hopefully I communicated
well enough on the other one that it was
over here I feel really really bad okay
let me just make sure let me kill this
one actually here let me delete this one
see if it'll let me delete it we're
going to delete it delete and that way
people don't go there yes delete there
ok and then let's go back to the live
one that way people don't get confused
live now okay
o.o hahaha okay I'm listening to myself
all right that's not cool all right let
me do okay go to the all Comments and
let's see who's here yay okay hi to
Mallory Mallory made it Mary Ann made it
um can I come can you come can can you
you're handsome partner I don't know
what that means maybe you wanted to see
John I don't know he's still sleeping
sort of he's like eyes are like cracked
open horrific he'll probably come over
and say hi in a minute I don't know what
that meant anyone try the simple my cell
my cell in water I don't know what that
is but go down to brick stitch if you
have will poop I see you Luke back
Marion good morning to Gina good morning
to Sarah and Kansas City hi Samantha
good morning yeah you figured it out who
and you figured it out even after I made
big mistakes so that's even more extra
props to you nerdling full hello my
friends good morning Jennifer um Queen I
don't know what I say your last name but
I know your name is Jennifer good
morning good morning Lily and good
morning glory in Pittsburgh so good to
see you all okay I'm hitting refresh
okay and it looks like i need to change
this to newest to first okay here we go
all right somerset good morning jenna is
a cold where you are i haven't been
outside yet so I don't know it was
freezing yesterday the kids went out to
play for like 45 minutes it was so cold
out there was no way I was going out
there um good morning Mackenzie good
morning sashy can't believe happen to
catch this part of the live before the
work before work yay I'm so glad you're
here where the first beauty gurus ever
watched an absolutely adore you and your
channel thank you so much that means a
lot to me Tashia says does anyone know
when the clinique blushers will be
available to us regular folks it's
afford not the I bieber's I know it's so
ridiculous I'm assuming it's not going
to be too long because they want your
money either gonna make it be that long
they should want to make vib rouge disco
special you know they gotta give people
have spent over a thousand dollar years
some kind of perk so that they feel like
it's worth
to be a vib rouge so I think that's the
only reason but I would imagine wouldn't
be too long how would you check good
morning my dear McKenzie says good
morning I'm so bummed that there won't
be a chat for two weeks I know this is
becoming part of my Sunday morning
routine I know I'm sad about it too but
we have plans on sunday morning to go
over to jon's mom's house and then so I
didn't want to we were talking about
well we could do it after the chat but
it's like that's not really very nice
for me to make my whole family wait for
me so I can chat I don't know I just
didn't think that was very nice let's
say so it so we're killing the chat uh
you know okay let's see what happened
here oh ok Mary had just said she wanted
to see John uh he'll probably have to
walk through at some point you'll at
least see his shoulders down he's still
kind of sleepy knurling phouka morning I
am typing slowly and carefully today so
I won't have another word explosion like
last week yeah I like didn't accept and
you always make sense so that was kind
of weird I went ahead and got the it
cosmetics tsv from QVC everybody was
talking about that on all the blogs so I
think that was you know one of like the
ones I've seen the most blow up a few
days ago and waiting for it to come in
so no review at the time other than that
positive she brought the wrong she
bought the wrong shade oh good luck
maybe hopefully you could like sell it
or something it's the wrong shade or you
pass it on to a friend or something Gina
says and you can remember ekam m1
product from Mac what it would be
girlfriend I don't own a lot of medical
I don't go to Mac I mean this is why I
don't go to Mac let me tell you number
one the people at my Mac are aren't
super friendly and nice they don't smile
at you they look like they're annoyed
when I go in like they're like okay I
gotta help another person like they're
just they're not very polite in my mac
so it's not a very welcoming atmosphere
it's usually pretty full there's usually
quite a bit of people there so it takes
a while to get something to help me so
just the shopping experience is not a
positive one rare at sephora like I go
in they know me they smile at me they
say hello and they say hey Jen they you
know I mean they know me there so it's
like and I get points at sephora you
know where i can like get
extra things and all that mac you don't
get points sephora has you know the
sales every once awhile they have the I
don't know I just feel more welcome at
sephora and alta to than I do at mac so
I don't buy anything for that reason
also everybody in the grandmother owns
mac and mac is very expensive so most of
the things that i would probably
recommend to you if i owned a lot of mac
everybody owns so I there's no point for
me there's no point buying something if
I'm not going to review it i'm not going
to review something that everybody else
is reviewed because that's boring so
that's a long story of why i don't any
own very much for mac i own like a
couple of lipsticks eye on that new
eyeshadow quad i own this the Cinderella
I shadow quad I think I'm going to
return this this was the UM the micro
violet fluid line I just don't like it
it's not opaque enough it moves too much
like I just I don't like it I don't
think I'm gonna use it but other than
that I mean I don't really have a lot of
suggestions I don't have any suggestions
for lipsticks my favorite are the luster
finishes I feel like they're very
moisturizing I like the way they look on
my lips but other than that that's all I
got if you have suggestions from mac
cosmetics go find Gina HT their big
purple lips go comment to her I'm sure
she would appreciate some suggestions
and then Melanie and James milne hai
finally caught it live yes yes I'm so
excited to have you here willing okay
I'm assuming it's money it might be
James who knows ok this is ok refreshing
ok where's Melanie ok good Sarah's
already replying to Gina good ok ah
Nellie says good morning Jen good
morning yeah I said good morning good
morning Liz says good morning watching
from Idaho love what's up and make up
keep the good work Thank You Liz I
appreciate that good morning to Erica
glad to chat with you to the morning to
ash sap Lindsay's back ya ready to chat
Lindsay yay Sophie is is here good
morning to Sophie good morning to laura
from Scotland yay I have a friend from
Scotland's she goes there every summer
and I'm so jealous favorite drugstore
product from ash favorite drugstore
product right
home in the moment it changes you know
there's lots of favorites but honestly
my favorite right now is this the
morning I'll appellate new one I'm going
to get into a full review of all those
drugstore pallets that I reviewed not
this past week but the week before I
want to do I want to film like my wrap
up of all of those but of those i'll
give you asleep eek this one was my
favorite is it the same quality as
high-end no it's not but it's still my
favorite of all of those um let's see so
that that would be right now I mean I've
so many I like the Rimmel um the r-mo
lipsticks I really like this one's my
favorite this one is and I keep it right
there it's an airy-fairy I know where it
is I can grab it I don't exactly where
it is because like it's like my go-to so
those are just a couple of them if you
can find the Jesse scroll liquid
eyeliner that is a must-have for me i
would pay twenty dollars for that
eyeliner it's amazing it Lily says OMG
jen i got the Loreal new palette one and
it's very very similar to her $95 YSL
palette no surprise since l'oreal is
owned by YSL yeah it's a really good
palette my only complaint about this as
I feel like that the shadows don't stay
on as long even when I use a primer as
my high-end but they apply the same as
my high-end I just don't feel like the
longevity is there I've played with my
new to more i'm not going to get into a
for viewer i played with this one more
because I was trying harder to make this
one work I wanted to give this more of a
shot but this one is what has a really
nice color range too but that's great
Lily that's so awesome naeli says what
are the points for Sephora sorry never
been there ok so sephora every time you
buy something you get a point for every
dollar you spend so once you get to 100
points well yeah odd your points i think
is the lowest number of points you can
spend there might be 50s but i think
it's just a hundred then you can get
like deluxe ice samples of different
things they have different deals then
when you get to 500 points they have
these big huge deals that you can get
also when you spend what is it too is it
two hundred fifty dollars in a year then
you become a vib so then you get even
more little perks for things and then
when you spend a thousand dollars in a
year you become a vib rouge that gives
you free shipping off their website you
get special access while VIPs get a
social access to the ib rouges get even
more special access also the IBS
and vib rouge is get a special gift I
believe for their birthday like
everybody gets a gift but then there's
like an extra thrown in for VIPs and vib
bruises I think Lulu I forget um but
there's they're just little perks and
things that you get for shopping there
so I just like that and I like the
people smile at me when I go in and it's
like there's are my regular people my
favorite person went over to mac though
so maybe if I go over and visit her at
Mac people will be nicer to me her
name's Ashley she's amazing ok so let's
do let's refresh you oops what on that
comment pending approval so let me see
who got rejected oh it's Jessica oh it
is this from this hi Jen you know it oh
she just emailed me oh I email Jessica
from gym beauty 89 so she finally
watched my lapel video she uploaded hers
today she graced the victim or two is
harder to work with I agree with you
Jessica Jessica got marked as spam I'm
so glad that I checked that she is my
girl okay let me go back hold on a
minute where is that hold on a minute is
that from what's up in makeup now I'm
getting confused what's happening here I
think let me just make sure I'm in the
right place let me make sure hold on a
minute because I want to make sure that
I am in the right comments just a second
because I think I just messed something
up okay open in new tab I'm going to
hear myself talk for a second until I
can pause it okay sorry about that I
just wanna make sure I'm in the right
comments if you oughta know Jessica from
jmud 89 she's amazing okay all right now
let me go to newest it was first okay
let's go back I'm getting to the
questions okay all right Lilly says
she'll be making a video today showing
swatches of comparing them um her she
has a really bad head cold she's been
going through some help thing so um I
just think it's amazing that Lily keeps
up with all of that even though she
isn't feeling well she's fabulous if you
haven't checked out Lily Spurgeon's
channel and go ahead and click on that
and check out her channel she's awesome
laura says what under-eye concealer do
you recommend it's moisturizing this is
the one I always recommends
now I don't have dry under eyes but this
is the one that I always recommend and
that's by the bomb and it's called time
bomb and the reason why I like this is
because I feel like it is so creamy it
is fair it's full coverage but it's not
obnoxiously full coverage it doesn't
make you look like a mannequin I don't
know why I just put that all over my
finger that's not helpful but i really
really love this concealer I've never
heard a negative review on this it is my
absolute favorite another one that is a
little bit better i think for for drop
weight is implemented be better for
drier skin this is the instant age
rewind eraser for dark circles and this
is the treatment concealer I've heard
the brightener is really really good as
well you coming through baby gonna come
say hi I don't think they hello hello
hello people were asking to see you they
were the kids are crazy the kids are
being so good they're like super quiet
in there no no all right let's get back
to the makeup stuff alright so yes Laura
I would recommend that and then anybody
else that has concealer suggestions find
Laura coking ok ok ing your I don't
know I don't know how to say that
alright I'm trying I'm trying ok wheres
it will say cooking because that
phonetically that's the way I would
split it Amit Samantha Richmond ok let's
try this again computers being glitchy
good morning from Michigan good morning
so happy it's actually working live I've
been looking forward to this all week
yeah me too I look forward to live chat
i'm so not even know like what's do with
myself the next two sundays and be so
sad i'm good morning from australia yay
sarah its isn't it like midnight or one
o'clock in the morning in Australia
right now thank you for being here it's
like tomorrow and today just started
here alright so alia Jessica's comment
is there Thank You Jessica for being
here Ali good morning Jen and ladies
prop popping in before work glad you
came by Ali Ali came by last week to
chantay good morning Shante has been
when I subscribers forever so if he says
any good drugstore face primers Oh sneak
peek peek this isn't this isn't
technically drugstore because you can't
get it at the drugstore but it's
drugstore pricing I have
been trying more products from Coastal
Scents I'm going to be doing a coastal
sets not just eye shadow grand review
video at some point probably in the next
two weeks or so um these these primers
oh my goodness I was shocked how much I
like these and these are on what what
happened was is when I did what happened
was when I did the review of the UM
revealed 3 palette they gave me a
hundred dollar gift card to go on their
website and buy things last time when i
got the revealed to I it away but I
really wanted to try some things and do
a video of some of their other products
so like I got this and I got this this
face primer is awesome I was so excited
it reminds me a lot of the Smashbox
primer the only thing i don't like about
is I feel like a little bit too much
comes out in the pump and like one pump
so this is just be being nitpicky is
that you just kind of have to do half a
pump instead of a full pump or else
you'll end up with too much but this I
primer I know you didn't ask behind
primers but oh my goodness I would try I
was trying these with those drugstore
palettes and it's amazing like seriously
like you could totally tell I put it on
my right eye my right eye as my tester I
when I put on like primer or anything
whenever I'm trying to me I always do my
right eye that way don't forget which I
I put the product on but seriously like
at the end of the day my left I had
barely any eyeshadow on and this one was
like bright so I know this so I prefer
drugstore that wasn't what you asked all
right face primer for drugs or do I have
any no honestly I don't think I have any
drugs to our face crimes oh this one's
pretty good this is a l'oreal revitalift
miracle blur I feel like this does blur
my pores and fine lines and I don't have
big pores I have medium to small pores
but I do feel like it does do that
disappearing act on those and I've heard
good things from people with bigger
pores with this other than drugstore
face primer that I have I talk so I
farmers but not face primers mmm hi baby
you coming back hi so if you need for
drugstore face primers go down to Sophie
if you have any suggestions for drugs or
face primers look out for Sophie she's
got a cute little smiley face going
Carla watching from her iPad where to
ask questions right here girlfriend Bryn
says good morning from Philly not too
far from me do you have any great
concealers right now wait did I already
do that one I think I already did that
one if i didn't i just said um if this
is a new concealer one hello dog dog
shaking his collar if if you were a
different concealer person the time bomb
is my favorite i think this is a
different one but this is my absolute
favorite concealer of all time let's go
ahead and oh and go if you have favorite
concealers just in general brand
victoria wants to know about that
lindsay says airy-fairy has always in
her purse yes I lost mine for a little
while because it was in my person I
could remember what purse I put it in
mary ann says trying to find some
skincare which works well but not too
expensive she's a comely clinique I
cannot say clinic to save my life it's
like like unique New York unique New
York Clooney clever but she lives in the
UK the cost is ridiculous know anything
which works well but is but but over the
pond I don't want to high planned as I
she's on a money diet okay so if you are
in the UK or you know UK skincare brands
comment back to Mary Ann fell she would
like to know all about that honestly
like as far as skincare stuff stuff like
it skincare is so personal because your
skin type makes a huge difference in
whether something works for you or not
so I hate I I don't like to review
skincare products because of that
because everybody is so unique in that
way I think he's gonna go get some
breakfast I'll eat some breakfast oh ok
he said he was up all night looking at
houses we're thinking about moving
because this house we are just so
outgrown out of this house we might be
moving in the next couple months but
that's a whole other story let's go back
to skincare so I don't like recommending
skincare Mary Ann tell us what skin type
you are and type it in a new comment
because i'm going to scroll past your
old one so type it in a new one what
your skin type is and the main we can
help you a little better with skincare
alright Sarah says you think she needs
to pick up that tart sneak sneak peek on
the laugh is the rainforest yeah that
they rereleased the rainforest paladin
it I've heard it's great palate she
misses the first time around and kicked
herself for it so do you think you're
going to get it Sarah
the rainforest palette the lip color set
with the exfoliator looks good too i
know i couldn't believe how inexpensive
that was to nearly said thank you no
problem liz says good morning from
horrigan gum winning Liz beauty is
science i just want to show some love
it's been about a month and I stopped
every Sunday to watch your video
excellent all she's a biology professor
that loves makeup that's so awesome
thank you for stopping by i appreciate
it yeah a biology professor I was an
anatomy anatomy I was an occupational
therapy major for one month and I
literally think it was making me go
crazy because I just couldn't memorize
things I realized after just a couple of
weeks that there was no way I could do
anything science-related anything where
I had to memorize that stuff there was
just it's wouldn't stay in my brain like
I was driving my lab partners crazy so I
had to quit I just quit I just stopped I
mean I think I went to the classes but I
stopped studying i knew that i just
wasn't gonna keep doing the class i
dropped the class it was just terrible
but anyway so my point is i admire
people that are in any kind of biology
science ii kinds of stuff nurses and
doctors and you know anybody that has to
memorize all that stuff just oh my gosh
it's amazing I could never do it let's
see jxs the bell is to face products
really worth the money yes yes they are
honestly they really are I just got the
sugar pop palette i'm so over my budget
so over my budget for this month um
sugar pop cowlick i had been using this
drug store pallets for like two weeks
and i started using this and I was like
well that's why i love my hand it's like
I could really tell a difference it was
like immediate the difference hey hey
Matt off my cats we can scratch he
winces um I could really tell the
difference and yes they are honestly
they are most of them but like some of
them I mean oh wait no to face she faced
not high-end the two-faced yes I do feel
like they're worth it short long answer
yes short answer yes long answer was all
of the what I just said and if you have
any comments to her about to face
products maybe some suggestions for her
its J xsv Bell go ahead and scroll down
and talk to her all right
and a beauty bubble good morning I just
wanted to say I actually found you on
keek a little over a year ago I used to
be obsessed it's an app where you do
like little short videos and I loved it
and then it was having issues on my
phone so I quit it my question is a
two-part have you ever had a company get
upset as your honesty with their
products how did you handle it if so
okay well Coastal Scents I don't think
is very happy with me because there were
a bunch of people that got sent that
review the not that review can't speak
they got a lot of people got sent that
revealed 3 palette they put up I think
everybody's video like I looked on
YouTube and so all the cook all the ones
where people got it for promo early all
of them were up except for mine every
single one of them I think they were
upset but I'm sorry you give me a chalky
palette and I'm gonna say it's chalky
I'm not gonna lie about they know what
the deal is so I'm hoping to continue to
send me stuff I hope they're not too mad
at me um because I do love Coastal
Scents products I just felt like a lot
of that palette I was not happy with and
I I'm not gonna lie about it I whatever
so I just kind of you know it's kind of
like you know I was not happy that they
didn't put it up but I mean what can I
expect when I say you know didn't really
recommend it I can't expect them to put
it off you know hey we've got these new
curtains for our doorway over here
because this is our bedroom and we put
some curtains up because we're just
tired of not having a door uh so my cat
scratching and it's annoying me um other
thing Oh other people usually if people
aren't happy with one of my reviews they
just don't email me again a lot of times
companies will say hey thanks for the
video we really enjoyed it but sometimes
I just hear nothing it's like crickets
from the company sorry but I always give
them a disclaimer at the beginning and
when I win it but when they're gonna
send me something I say you know it's in
it's in one of my videos I have the
little disclaimer that I said you know
it's like you know I don't guarantee
positive reviews I will be honest with
you know i'm going to give you an honest
review it's good to be lypo is going to
be honest and lately I've been a little

they look at me like they like they need
a better customer I feel the same way I
feel the same way KJ tastic hi Jen good
morning wanted to know what your 5
beauty essentials are much love from
Delaware not too far from me Delaware
where are you um five beauty essentials
by beauty essentials um I don't know is
that makeup essential beauty essentials
um one would be my my lash what is it my
last stuff that i use always I'm oh my
goodness i had my brain is just out of
my head i was up like in and up like up
and down all night last night because
what's up in makeup was taking forever
to upload so i had to set my alarm for
an hour and then get back up at like
two-thirty in the mornings my brains
like the not lash food i've been using
the lash food one and i think my tube
was dried up um oh my gosh the lash I'll
put it down in the description later but
though the lash the last growing stuff
that I use that I talk about all the
time I know people say they changed the
formula of it but I haven't noticed any
difference I feel like that's an
essential for me because my lashes get
really short and stubby when I don't use
it I know how it's bothering me somebody
tell me what my favorite lash come up my
lash growth serum it's because i can't
remember when is God ok so that's one
and then i would say me cuz it's like
you know is beauty stuff really
essential you know really truly are we
really like us is it essential it's not
so it's hard for me I my favorites but
once anything is essential nothing
nothing is essential everything can be
replaced I hate to say that but it's
true I mean I definitely have favorites
but I feel like nothing is essential
there's things I would cry my eyes out
if I lost but that's a really hard
question for me to answer if you have
beauty things that you would say our
essentials go ahead down to her comment
and comment back some of your favorites
so that is I lost it um KJ tastic go
ahead and scroll down if you have any
beauty essentials to recommend to her
Melissa McCracken hi Melissa good
morning so here's my story the week i
bought the body shot body butter and
Satsuma smells like citrus and my 17
year old walks into my bedroom and asked
me if i was hungover I said no why and
he told me I smelled like stale beer so
I was mourning of anyone else had an
issue with that embody worked sense
changing on them that is so funny
there's a couple people that are
commenting back that's a hilarious story
I don't buy a lot of body shop oh it
says bodywork sent so I think she net
body shop sends changing on them I don't
really buy stuff from there so I don't
have any experience with that but um so
funny so funny all right Lily says
you're too sweet i absolutely love and
admire how you make an effort to know
your subscribers on a personal level I
mean it just comes that's what i like to
do i don't i don't see any point in not
getting to know people it's more fun
that way like letting people that don't
get to know their subscribers they're
losing their losing they don't realize
that they're losing but they're losing
its it's more of a benefit I feel like
to me than it is to you guys to get to
know you cuz I learned so much Lindsey
he has the coolest sleeves I agree I
really like that my husband sleeves i
love you sleep I told him I said hand I
said wrists down her mind I don't want I
don't want him to get his hands tattooed
and I didn't want him to get neck up
tattooed and then you know everything
else is fair game but I said just keep
those two places for me I don't like
hand tattoos and I don't like anything
up here like people of neck tattoos
that's not my personal thing
um alright nearly says all you guys you
guys are goals oh I feel so fortunate to
have found him hi Lori mcnett what do
you recommend it Mecca recommendation
for hunting fine lines under the eyes
minor bad and nothing for me is really
working nothing hides them nothing will
hide them I I finally nothing hides them
what I do is you just have to find an
eye cream that works for you and
honestly most of them do not do anything
the only eye cream that I have found
that works for me that diminishes them a
little bit is the one by tart I just
have a little sample of it and it's this
their eye cream I think they only have
one that's the only one I've been able
to see any kind of difference but it's
not even dramatic it's just a little bit
so just stinks man there's a couple of
comments underneath Lori's comment if
you have any questions any comments for
hiding fine lines under eyes go under
Lori mcnatt and give her some suggestion
Diane says good morning from Michigan hi
Diane Allison says good morning from
South Carolina hi Allison but it's warm
there Judy says good morning from Canada
what part of Canada Judy um poetry took
one of my favorite one of my friends
came over last night and she was teasing
you about all my eyeshadow palettes I
forget what amount of makeup I have it
it looks like to an average person I
know right yeah I have a really small
collection as far as YouTube standards
LOL i mean youtube is a whole nother
it's a whole nother planet when it comes
to makeup collections i mean i remember
when i first started i was like who in
the world would ever do a Duke video
because what's the point of having more
than one thing and then I realized that
you naturally get dupes when you buy and
obnoxious gotta make I'm not noxious
amount of makeup you end up with dupes
by accident some people purposely by
doobs and I I have a little bit of I
don't know I think it's great if you're
gonna make a video about it and share
them with people I think that's
wonderful but I wouldn't I don't think i
would purposely by a dupe unless unless
i was going to make a video about it but
John what are you doing he's yelling I
don't know what he doughnut he's yelling
my son's yelling something um but yeah I
mean it like if you look at like Tara
babies of her collection it's just it's
insane it's insane and I think that it's
it's you know I think everyone has their
thing some people
fact you know action figures some people
play you know click video games some I
mean everyone has their things that they
collect and enjoy and like makeup is
just what I collect and enjoy but people
do think that it's crazy I agree with
you i'm totally with you and i know you
have a lot of makeup because i've talked
to you about your makeup collection
before and your products that you own
all right and then Lily's talking about
her mother-in-law her mother-in-law's
got a crazy amount of makeup she's all
high-end like really super duper high in
a shop what mascara do you recommend
what's your favorite favorite ones right
now let's see do I have them Szilard I
throw them away because I just went
through a cleansing okay Jordana best
that / extreme I should throw this away
I keep it but I don't know why this is
old um this is over three months old but
this is amazing for drug store the Urban
Decay perversion I should also throw
away because this is old but I love this
that's a really good one let's see
anything else in here there's standing
out to me right now I some bad ones this
one is terrible I did not like that one
at all I got this one this one's pretty
good I do have the benefit on this one
right here i'm going to do a review of
this eventually I think this one's okay
it's better for length than it is for
volume and then will clump your lashes
if you're not careful and it stays wet
and it's got all kinds of issues but
this one's okay it's pretty good but as
far as favorites right now these two of
my favorites drugstore and high ends
these are my favorites but there's so
many good ones if you have your favorite
mascara go ahead and find a sh sap
ashley says your go to samantha's as i
know you have a video up for this
already but the l'oreal appellate the
pink tongue one are they worth to buy I
really want the naked 3 palette make it
three ish palette but doesn't want to
spend fifty dollars all right some again
I'm going to do a full video on this but
let me just give you a breakdown on this
okay this is a good palate if you don't
mind your eyeshadow fading if you don't
use it you gotta use a primer with it or
else is going to fade second thing is
that the color range is terrible when
you start working with it um there-there
good there's a lot of good colors in
here but the problem is is that they're
all similar tone so when you put them
together on your eye
just ends up looking muddy there's not
enough contrast so if you're willing to
use other palettes with it you can make
this work but if you're not willing to
use other palettes with it do not get it
it's not a good standalone palette the
quality is pretty good they're easy to
work with they're gentle easy to work
with and then this one is also a naked 3
ish kind of palette but this one is
harder to work with it's a little more
powdery and you just got to work harder
for it and the fading problem is still
there but there is a nice contrast here
it's not a super great contrast you
might want to pick something out of
other palettes for this but I feel like
the color range is a little better and
this one and this one but oh my goodness
RT 1040 are you kidding me oh I hate
that all right how much better you will
have left are I got forty forty three
percent because eventually i'm probably
have to go somewhere else all right and
plug it in because my plug does not
reach it's a long story uh extension
cord is an investment i need to make all
right i'm loving the under high setting
powder by elf and that's from lindsey
that is good to know shashi says if she
is having a full-size the bomb eyeshadow
in every bag in april whoo also i've
been wanting to try a highlighter what
are your top once you recommend both
high end and drugstore highlighters i
talked about this last week I don't have
any drugstore highlighters because i
have so many high-end highlighters it's
not something i use very often and i go
through them very very quickly I mean
they're very slowly but then my
highlighters very very slowly so I do
not um have any drugstore highlighters
but as far as high-end highlighters of
course the hourglass is going to be in
there the mary-lou manizer mary-lou
manizer by the bomb Cindy Lou is I'm
used to you Cindy Lou that much but Mary
Lou I really like let's see anything
else this julep one I actually really
like look at this I mean just gorgeous
gorgeous gorgeous love that uh anything
else those are my favorites there are
some cream ones that are good that I
like the Becca set that I got this one
here I really like this is the mini set
or deluxe sample we're being caught this
one is in opal I really like this one a
lot
and then there's this one this one is in
champagne gold if you have that kind of
skin tone they can handle this and then
there's a white one where's the white
one I don't know where the white one is
but the white one's good too that one's
fun that one's a little more I think for
like a nighttime kind of look it gives
you a little more of that BAM all right
so any other highlight recommendations
accept especially drugstore highlights
go to Sashi prints and down below Emily
says good morning from Ohio good morning

really like this I'm not lighter but it
keeps them from yellowing I really
really like this a lot and then I'm

recommendations for a good everyday
foundation for combination skin so go
down to walla it's a little pretty
little beachy kind of scene comment for
everyday foundation for combination skin
i don't have combination skin so why
keep recommending things when I don't
have that skin type um and I just don't
want to recommend badly so if anyone has
any recommendations please put that down
they are Erica Chapman good morning
everyone has anyone tried the new
toothpaste sugar pill I think that's
what it's called eyeshadow palette babe
I think you're rocking bold colors this
spring any ideas how okay yeah here we
go okay so yes I really really like this
a lot I'm very excited about it if you
look at the whatsit make a video that I
just put up that was this as the lid
color and then I put this in the center
to the outside and then this color is in
the crease the malted milk ball so this
was lid this the macaroon was center to
outer corner and a malted milk ball in
the crease and then I put the sweet and
spicy over to kind of just soften up any
harsh
so a great way to add color is to just
put a little pop in your outer corner
and then deepen it up another way is
hitting your lower lash line with a pop
of color that's really fun to do you can
do that with eyeshadow or eyeliner
there's lots of things you can do you
can add a little bit of a pop of colored
liner I don't know if this could be a
trend or not but this is something I've
done in the past as you do like a
colored liner here and then put black
right next to your lash line I don't
know that might be out of date though so
don't do that maybe that won't be a good
one but I used to do that a lot but yeah
definitely adding that pop here and then
the lower lash line is a great way to do
color on your eyes Lily says moved to
Albuquerque New Mexico he'd be close to
me and Julie G yeah that would be
awesome I can't move that far away from
my mom no way no I guess cuz like I
can't I I need to see my mommy there's

Oh Mac Mac too good morning I've
recently joined a Facebook group where
you can shred makeup how do you feel by
the subject I haven't done it yet kind
of scared I was on Eden for a while
which is a makeup trading website and I
had wonderful experiences that's how I
got my ass they Lauder Double Wear
that's how i got my natural and night
palette by to face was trading I have no
problem trading make up with people like
I don't have sensitive skin I don't have
problems with my face like if like a
little bit of song gets on my face it
doesn't bother me so I have no problems
trading makeup I do not trade like
eyeliners and mascaras if they've been
open like that freaks me out but other
than that like all trade eyeshadows I'll
trade foundation all trade blushes like
I don't care about that stuff there's
actually one of those services where
they actually sanitize the products
before they send them out I forget what
it's called if you know what that is
comment to Mac Mac to where they send
them to them they stand aside them and
then they send them back out if you're
curious about that let's say P Christine
cundiff good morning everyone sad i
missed the live feed last week happy
spring can't wait for the vib sale next
month I know why does everybody know
about this and I don't I'm supposed to
be the ones to make a person and I don't
even know about this wonder what's on
the top of your list ah the shade and
light Kat Von D contour palette yes yes
but I mean I don't know if I'm going to
buy that much because I'm like I need to
be on know why I spent way too much
money this month too much money all
right Marlene says better be blunt than
a big fat liar so I should by talking
about with when I talk to companies and
I don't like their product I completely
agree but there I think there's a way
say you don't wanna be rude but
something's not good I'm not gonna move
I cannot tell you I cannot with straight
face tell you something is bad tell you
something is good when it's bad I can't
do it um alright Daisy says Josephine
Fusco is a new and great YouTube
tutorial youtube channel she's a makeup
artist in Long Island I think you told
me about her before didn't you she wants
me to do more tutorials because she
watches those um that I have done often
ok I mean I'm trying thing is is I only
have X amount hours in the day working
full time like last week I only put up
one video and I have a stack of videos
waiting to be edited
like a stack I have my daughter's posh
pack opening from februari that's going
up next from februari it's like I can't
fit stuff in but I do want to do more
tutorials that's the idea I just mm-hmm
too much stuff going on I want to though
just no Daisy I want to I'm katytastic
Jen I know you mentioned before that you
really love the hourglass immaculate
foundation but have you ever tried the
Lancome new miracle foundation no I
haven't it is it too is a liquid powder
formula but it's about fifteen dollars
cheaper I have both foundations and
actually before the Lancome texture and
weight is very light and supervised
season coverage mm that's good to know
thank you I after I after i'm done with
this off to type that into my phone okay
so we got three minutes left and I got
twenty-three percent battery I'm gonna
make it yay okay so we'll just go into
my battery start to die him how about
that all right lolos photos I definitely
appreciate your honesty thank you in
fact that you see up front when you're
receiving products for promotion I have
to I wouldn't you guys my loyalty is
always to you guys I want to be
professional with the companies but it
without my you guys watching and
trusting me like I lose your trust now
my channel not as well we've done
because that that needs to be number one
um I think a lot of people especially
channels that grow very quickly take for
granted how important subscribers are
and people that are watching our I it's
so I mean you guys are the key you guys
are the core of the channel and without
you have nothing so lying to you is a
really bad idea you guys are my priority
just so you know because anything else
just is dumb okay Erica Rodriguez i'm
new to make up i want to take the plunge
by my first high-end palette what would
you suggest for a high-end eyeshadow
palette it depends on your skin tone and
sarah says the Urban Decay Naked pellets
and I agree with her honestly like I
would say either the one or the two
because of 3 i've heard some mixed
reviews and i feel like you know that
one is a little more advanced you know
as far as using it as far as the shade
ranges i would say definitely the naked
the original naked or the naked 2 would
be my first number one suggestions
they're easy to work with creative
ridiculous amount of looks it last you
forever like you will have that thing
forever it's definitely worth the
investment

Coastal Scents maybe what's your
favorite benefit products hmm I do
personally like they're real mascara a
lot of people don't like it but I liked
what makes my lashes look it is very
pokey though so you have to be careful
you don't poke yourself in the eye um
but benefit products benefit products
let's say bonne fete where I find
benefit that seeks I'm having workmen
always like that then effects this is
the uniform I time focused on my head
all the top of my head I'm definitely
going to say though they're real mascara
I personally like even though I know it
doesn't work for everybody but I think I
own a lot of benefit when do I own this
benefit that I actually like mmm I have
their creaseless shadows I don't like
that one I have one of those I don't
like it if you have favorite benefit
products go to Sophie say da ok
I go to that and then Brielle was trying
to say letÃ­s I've heard good things
about latisse for the eyes eyeliner not
eyeliner for the eyelash making your
eyelashes grow I've heard great things
about it but that wasn't it it was rapid
lash Diane says essential moisture I
essential equals moisturizer LOL yeah
that's true that's true and i'm almost
out of my L'Oreal moisturizers I'm going
to be trying some new things Alina says
hey Jen finally made it for the live
chat eating cinnamon rolls I love
cinnamon rolls and drinking coffee
watching you it's a perfect morning it
would be perfect for me if I had a
cinnamon roll too I love cinnamon rolls
Lindsay says i love that you just said
nothing is essential I mean really I
agree with the moisturizer thing Lori
says hey Jen love your channel just
wanted to help you out Oh bogan via is a
plant with beautiful flowers ok I think
I have them in my yard the pronunciation
is boog on via thank you so much George
I know I hate pronouncing things that I
don't know how to pronounce and I'm like
force and I look it up and I listen to
the way people say it and I still have
trouble with it it's like ah I got close
though it wasn't too bad alright
Michelle says hey Jed do you think the
new jay manuel blush sounds almost
identical to the description and the
jewel of diamond powder blushes I hadn't
thought of that but kind of the way he
described them all sounds almost
identical to the copy of the jeweled
blushes that's interesting I don't think
the julep ones work well or last very
long and hate to buy the same product I
don't think performs well when America's
Next Top Model they say his name is
Manuel oh that's good to know thank you
for that CI I can't know everything
about everything and I don't watch that
show so there you go Thank You Michelle
for that and we'll have to see what a
net thinks as far as those blushes and
whether they're good or not I totally
ate one Eddie two point oh I totally
trust her opinions of that blush
Millie's blog hi Jenna I Delhi okay Ali
says what do you think about Matt
constantly releasing limited edition I
releasing limited edition items it
annoys me because it can never actually
get them what the heck it's a marketing
thing it's a marketing thing and I think
it's genius do I think that it's nice no
but I think it's genius I think they're
really smart to do it because people buy
into it
um yeah so I mean they're never going to
run out colors never never so good for
them not so good for us but good for
them half a gale cares yeah I'm so glad
I caught you from cali I'm usually late
you're my favorite youtuber all Thank
You Abigail I know I can always trust
you thank you I try the only problem
comes when I have a different opinion
when I try something and it works for me
and it doesn't work for somebody else
and we can't always match all the time
but that's okay that's what makes the
world of beautiful places that we can
disagree sometimes Jackie says you plan
or to review the elf skincare products I
would like to i actually got on email
from elf that they want to send me some
but it's just I don't like I don't like
reviewing like i said earlier i don't
like reviewing skincare products because
everyone's skin type is different and I
feel like what works for me and my
normal skin will be totally terrible
maybe for somebody with oily or dry skin
so I don't like to review our skin care
but go to Jessica jmud 89 she did a
review of those i believe and if anyone
else has any opinions on the off skin
care products go to Jackie all right
it's 1104 but I still have a little bit
of battery left it looks like I'm going
to be dying very soon so I've got a
couple more comments left in me before
my battery dies Tyler Tyler release
Archer good morning have you all ever
had an eyeshadow primer stopped working
for you I've been using the wet and wild
fergie take on the day for months and
has been working just fine then all of a
sudden when I got to the end to stop
working maybe because the product
separated maybe it maybe because it's at
the end maybe you use some of the oils
maybe it's just wasn't mixed well and
that's why I stopped working i would
imagine if you bought a new one that it
would probably work just the same as it
did with the other one that's my guess
so she's trying the Milani one but not
sure about it yet also Urban Decay's
primer potion never worked for me I've
heard that for other people to it's
worked for me but I really think it just
depends on your own personal skin type
with primers like I said the Coastal
Scents one has been amazing for me if
you ever buy something from Coastal
Scents throw in that eye shadow primer
in there it's poo I'm loving it lisa
says good morning from Toronto Canada
good morning karen says hi from Chicago
good morning Judy says she's in Winnipeg
hello oh my goodness so I had asked her
up there goes the battery notification
so I've got like two more questions
before it tells me that it's actually
going to die let's see so we have
she's clarifying for me Alina says have
you tried the L'Oreal butterfly mascara
yes it's amazing and I forgot about that
one it's amazing i have a backup of it
somewhere but i haven't opened it yet
but oh my goodness i'm in love with it
yes definitely and then hey it's laura
all gotta go heading out for breakfast
with the hubby have fun I know you're
probably gone but have fun have a great
sunday you to girlfriend all right
Melissa says hey I think HSN is having a
tsv this they have TS fees to this
thursday with benefit cosmetics I hadn't
realized they had TSB's I thought that
was a QVC thing and so how in the know I
really am I count on Susan help me with
those but if they do Wow that'd be cool
HSN having a tsp or benefit cosmetics so
if you're interested in that go to HSN
according to Melissa yay alright nearly
says I'm sorry I'm constantly commenting
that's okay every time I put on your
videos my tongue will come out of her
room and into mine and get in my bed and
lick the screen Oh imagine if I came to

about to cry because every time I go on
live chat and yours she misses them all

same as it's not the same keep doing
what you're doing thank you so much
alright Samantha says should I splurge
on the naked 3 I don't own it um swatch

suggestion if you have any comments

only one heartbroken that Laura Mercier
