what's up the makeup chat for May
seventeenth of 2015 thank you so much
for joining me this morning I'm excited
to chat with you about makeup than all
these wonderful things that we love
though how you chat is down in the
description below and just reminder if
you were on a mobile mobile device
you'll be able to watch but you won't be
able to comment which really really
stinks but that's the way YouTube has it
set up and there's nothing I can do
about it which really stinks but if you
would like me to see a comment if you
are alive with me and you would like me
to see a comment type je m in capital
letters and the beginning of your
comment and I will make sure that i read
that one out loud as long as it's
appropriate and if you are responding to
someone put at and then their username
and then that way they know that you're
talking to them also there's no need to
repeat your comment multiple times
because I'm going through them in the
order that they are put in so that means
the later that you come to the chat the
less likely I am to be able to get to
your comment so I go just in order of
when they're types and I feel like
that's kind of the most fair way to do
it so I'm really really excited to talk
with you today I'm gonna go ahead and
switch over to the chat now let's see
okay open let's see what we got going on
money okay okay here's the chat okay
here we go the gold digger good morning
good morning to Susan Alicia okay I'm
gonna say good morning to a couple more
people and then we will go back to
Elysia poetry trick good morning to you
Sarah sparkles good to see you i'm so
happy that you're here for the first
time Tyler says good morning from wet
and soggy Tessa's oh good morning to
Christy okay now we're starting to get
some questions so I'm going to go back
up to Alicia's question you had to
choose one eye shadow palette to use
forever what would it be you guys know I
have an eyeshadow palette addict and I
hate to say this but honestly it would
be this one probably because I feel like
it's the most versatile the lorac mega
Pro which had the most horrible release
in an eyeshadow palette history but
thanks to our old she was she was our
Sephora reporter for a really long time
be fly Rene
but she still has a blog that I link
down below on every single white to the
makeup but she's the one that told me
when this was live on amazon and i was
able to get one thanks to her but i
would say this one is one that I would
use forever if I had no if I could not
have that one then i would pick the
naked too I love my naked 20 maybe the
lorac pro 2 oh well yeah but the mega
Pro probably is my favorite right now
that I feel like is the most versatile
alright so hopefully that answered your
question Alicia okay let's see all right
good morning Jen from Kirsti what is
your favorite hydrating lip balm to use
and you use a lip exfoliator have a
lovely day okay for hydrating lip loans
get my lip balm for let's say you know
honestly like a lot of them I just um I
kind of switch off because my husband
has a lip balm problem so this is a hint
lemming like this is this drawer over
here is full of lip balms let me just
get some more hair these are all lip
balms yeah let's get some more my
husband has a problem see we both our
product addicts so um okay and there's
more in there look that's not even
everything you want another hand with
another painful here's some more okay so
this is the thing I'm constantly
switching off lip balms because he has
such a problem so I get to try all these
lip balms and you know married so we can
share lip balms let's see which ones are
some of my favorites in here now that I
totally ruined his drawer and going to
have to uh Henry do that one I like this
one this is the Nivea kiss of color care
one I really like this one this one's in
sheer pink so it does have a little bit
of a pink tinge to it but I really like
that one I like these these are by a
company called treat beauty and this is
the coconut cream lip balm I don't have
use this one as much but it is primarily
let's see cocoa butter so I really like
that one a lot I'm a big fan of Burt's
Bees I love birds bees and let's see if
I can get you one more so I can get you
one more that I like I like these two
these are the Badger cool mint cocoa
butter lip balm that's the scent of this
but the Badger brand I really really
like those
lot um yeah so those are those are
definitely my favorites let me see how
there any other ones I mean there's so
many good ones I really tend to go for
natural lip balms I like ones that have
the main ingredient as either cocoa
butter or coconut oil things like that
petrolatum does not agree with my lips
at all it tends to I feel like make my
lips dry out even further I know there's
lots of science behind petrolatum every
time I mention it cooking like get on
the about you know what the details are
with it but the fact is I don't like it
so I try to avoid products that have
petrolatum in them as far as a lip
exfoliator i use the elf lip exfoliator
i absolutely love that lip exfoliator
the little you know the lipstick e1
things amazing so that would be the one
I would recommend for there and you have
a lovely day too yay okay Madison says

sweet keep it going girlfriend you got
this you got this keep going Liz goal is
on to your you on as you work out Sarah
says can you recommend a good eye lid of
primer for oily folks okay I don't have
oily lids so it's really difficult for
me to recommend products for skin types
that I don't have I were a makeup artist
I would be much better at that so really
all i can recommend are ones that people
have told me are good for oily lids um
only leds who told what was the one
somebody told me recently was really
good for oily lids ah man it's out of my
head somebody just told me one so it's
really good for oily lids Oh is one we
talked about and what's up in makeup was
it last week it was specifically for
oily lids I want to say it was like a
new brand at sephora check what's up and
make up last week because i talked about
one that was specifically for oily lids
was it a korean brand I don't remember
and you had any suggestions for and see
who was that oh it went away it went
away Oh Sarah sparkles do at Sarah
sparkles if you have a good
recommendation for an eyelid primer for
oily lids please and thank you good
morning to Nikki if I think of it Sarah
I'll let you know good morning Nicki
Roxanne says good morning good morning

Kimberly good morning I didn't see the
old oh man I forgot to put the older
coupon where's my hold on a minute I
have it I have it have it you can google
it and you can go on the ultra website
and find it but I wanted to put it there
and I forgot yesterday I went on the
date with my husband and I completely
stopped all what's up in makeup activity
and went out on a date and then I came
back and I was up till about midnight it
wasn't she bad last night usually much
of one or two um what I thought I had
everything and I didn't where is my
magazine I alta magazine
oh oh it's on my phone I can find it on
my phone here I'll tell you what it is
and then I'll put it in the description
after chat oh I completely forgot okay
let me answer some questions while I
find this for you because I want to
multitask here you just open my ult up
where are you all tap ok all right next
question while I look for that oh let's
see does it include high end makeup no
it doesn't it's only for the non
prestige brands why is my own tap
crashing why do you hate me watch this
watch is can you see that crash crash
crash it's like okay so have to go to
the Ulta website but I mean it's it's on
the Ulta website I'm sure but it's a
number like you have to type in a number
oh here we go i found it 30 60 84 I went
to ulta calm and it says right at the
top of here it says twenty percent off
and it's got the code there for you so
there's that they don't hide it at least
this one later hide sometimes I feel
like they kind of hide them with this
one they're like BAM it's right there so
that's it for you girlfriend off I will
have to add it to the description though
thank you so much for reminding me of
that let's see Grady favorite
natural-looking blush of all time oh my
goodness blush junkie here to girlfriend
you know that we're blessed junkies
together okay natural looking natural
looking natural looking you know which 1
i've been really loving lately which
seems weird i got this on birchbox from
the birchbark shop this is called is
this it yep this is called Lohse los
cabos and it is there water resistant
blush I don't know how that's coming off
let me switch to my view so i can see
whether you can see that or not you see
if i can see you because i have to close
off of the view of me now you can't see
that there it is that's actually a
pretty true representation of the color
right there um and it's like a coral
kind of color I really really like this
one a lot I just got this a couple weeks
ago I'm not sure that's my favorite of
all time this blush drawers just insane
so am i being washed out again I hate
that let me say one close this window a
little bit i'll see if i can hold on i'm
gonna i'm working out the lighting here
hold on a second let me fix my lighting
and it relies
washed out so bad okay and then let me
turn this instead can I turn something
here open this on the real see if I
kidding thanks for your patience while I
fix my washed out face is that better
that looks a little bit better okay
because I want to be limp but I don't
want my face to look all white and funky
okay let me look for more natural
blushes I really like deep throat by
NARS I really like that one a lot
another one I really like is essex by
Kat Von D show you this one hmm I can
get it to really look true to color
behind my face maybe it'll focus um
that's it looks more like a bronzer but
it's not it does it's not a bronzer it
looks kind of like a bronzer this is
more of like a wintertime natural blush
but this is not doing justice go on
sephora website and look for the kat von
d blush in essex that's another really
good one um I'm so much to me blushes
cluster is out of control would you
don't want to see decluttering videos
because I need to do some serious
decluttering and I could do this on my
own but I don't want to like jump on the
decluttering trend and then look like
I'm copying everybody else you know on
san this is another good one this is the
NYX blush and natural and I'll just
leave it at that but there's so many
good ones it's hard to pick one it's
like picking from my children that one
isn't really doing it justice either but
you can see this one better than you
could see the UM the kat von d one it's
a little bit more true to color that's
huh there we go that's what it looks
like there we go um we I so many
favorite blushes girlfriend so many
favorite blushes how's the wedding

von d i know this is a weird choice but
this is the kat von d ladybird palette

going to put that one away cuz i like
that palette um let me see other matt
palettes where's the eye palette
overflow into a drawer nope that's not

Matt new because I don't like the color
selection in there though I like the
shadows where is it here we go to face
Matt I is amazing this is a really good
one I've heard that the new the natural
matte one is really good as well but I
love this one this one's amazing oh
let's say see I like I like this one
what a lot of people don't like this one
this is the it cosmetics naturally
pretty palette I love this palette but a
lot of people say it muddies up on them
so i'm not going to recommend that
because a lot of people disagree with me
on that one um yeah those i would say
out of my favorite ones that i own but
there's lots of Matt palettes that are
amazing out there I've heard the tartlet
palette is fantastic I pretty sure
that's all Matt oh boo gorgeous gorgeous

Marlene says Sarah spark oh she's
talking to Sarah okay um girlies got one
what has been your biggest challenge
when doing videos lighting and
backgrounds I know that's kind of dumb
but just the general look of my videos
has been the biggest challenge because
all these beauty gurus have these
beautiful gorgeous backgrounds in this
perfect natural light and it's just
gorgeous and I just can't do that i have
the smallest littlest tiniest house it's
a 14 house it's two bedrooms we actually
the kids live in the bedrooms we live in
what's supposed to be the formal dining
room um then we have the living room
there's this door here that leads to the
living room at least the kitchen that
leads to the two bedrooms and then
there's a teeny tiny little bathroom
that's like the size of a closet and
that's our whole house we have a huge
attic the attic goes the entire length
of a house we have a giant attic we have
no basement and and we live in the
dining room so they're my pool
just no room in this house for me to UM
to have a beautiful background and I
feel like people judge based on your
lighting in your background so hard and
I just people are constantly commenting
like hey if the only you had a good
background but I know I know but we're
working on moving we're gonna have to
put that on hold for a little while we
had to pay down a little bit of our debt
so we took everything we saved and we
paid down some of our debt so now we
have to save again and so it's going to
be a couple of months now at least not
everything we had saved but a lot of
what we had saved we had to pay down
some debt so it's going to be at least a
few months before we go back to the
house fine so I can get a better
background and better lighting among
other things like a bathroom that
actually has a plug in it because my
bathroom doesn't have a plug and a coat
closet because we don't have a coat
closet I mean just house is not
functional but anyway enough about me
complaining that's my biggest challenge
thank you for asking long story too late
too late too long story long story ok
Michelle says good morning excited the
first time can tune in thank you so much
for coming Michelle Jackie says what's
your favorite drugstore foundation and I
think I talked about this yeah if you've
been a chat before just know that I need
to answer everybody's question that I
know that sometimes I answer questions
more than once in weeks but you know I
need the answer everybody's question and
not everybody can tune in every week so
I need to answer everybody as they come
so of course I can't find it better put
it in the wrong drawer here we go ah
it's the wrong drawer okay this is my
current favorite drugstore foundation
this is the Maybelline matte and
poreless foundation and I have the color
classic ivory this is terrible for dry
skin though if you have dry skin don't
buy this this is for oily to normal oily
skin only love this it is definitely my
favorite drugstore foundation that I've
ever found if you put this into a
high-end bottle and gave it to me I
would believe you that this is a
high-end foundation I absolutely love it
um yeah that's that's what I'm going to
say about that I absolutely love it oh
my goodness sunny flinders hello from
Melbourne Australia it's midnight oh my
goodness thank you for staying up so
late today is done for you we just
started our day and
today is done for you love your channel

Australia is amazing thanks to him and
other things I've seen of course but

thank you so much Pam I really
appreciate that like I said Jen to face
is coming out with a new foundation on
june fifteenth called born this way I
found that I put it on my Instagram
right after I finished filming I was so
upset I did not get that in the show but
it was on my Instagram right after I
finished filming but it looks really
cool and looked like they were gonna
allow you to order samples ahead of time
which is really smart of them really
really smart of them Katie leg good
morning Jen if you tried the Pixie lip
balm it's my new love we have one we
have a fixie ball Lucy lip balm right
here and I never use it I should use it
it's got is this the one you're talking
about oh it's got it something on it mmm
um this one is the shea butter lip balm
but it's really pigmented if i remember
right you say no it's not too pigmented
i don't know if you guys can see that
it's not too pigmented but it definitely
out a pigmentation to it i never use
this it's chi guess it's kind of like
the sugar rose ones but it definitely
doesn't feel like the same texture but
but yeah it doesn't feel as oily as the
sugar roses what I'm saying i feels like
more more dense
but I'll definitely up to try this
because I haven't really been using it
it just kind of got thrown in jour and
not really used so I'll have to give it
showed a little more love thank you so
much for suggesting that let's say so
thank you Katie Madison said what's your
favorite makeup product girlfriend you
are asking me to pick between my
children like how do I even do that my
favorite makeup product like in general
in general I would say I shadow
eyeshadows my favorite thing definitely
eyeshadow and I love my liquid eyeliners
if I had to pick something a little more
specific I'm seriously like I think I
like this better than the Jessie's Girl
this is the multiply lash enhancing a
liquid eyeliner by tart tart tart
visitarte yes George yes by tart I think
this has passed Jesse's girl in my
favorite eyeliner but Jesse's girl still
amazing but this these liquid eyeliners
these pan liners oh my goodness oh my
goodness these things changed my life
changed my life as far as my ability to
do eyeliner because all I thought there
was was well they're all there was was
the liquid where it has a little brush
and then the pencils and I just was not
having luck with that so these things
like oh this is my my holy grail one's
been my holy grail one forever this is
the Jesse scroll liquid eyeliner but I
think tarts passing it man really like
this but this is twice the price so I
don't think it's worth twice the price
but if I had to choose between the 2i
probably pick the tart at this point
just because I've been loving on it
lately let's save okay jessica says hi
Jen love your channel thank you i really
trust your opinion on makeup thank you
so much you know someone sent me they
commented on a really old video that i
had about a benefit um cream eyeshadow
they're like I love you I love your
videos i love your opinion i trust your
opinion but you're so off base on this
one was basically the UM the comment and
it was like a video that's like two
years old i had a green screen
background like that's how old this
video is is talking about trouble with
my background one time I for a little
while I guess was a few months I decided
to do a green screen background because
I just have nowhere that's a cool
background just to do something
different and it did not take off well
people did not like it um but anyway so
she was basically saying I send the
video you know it's not good for aging
lids because I felt get accentuated my
fine lines and she strongly disagreed
with that so I mean you know nobody is
going to be able to give you review that
you agree with one hundred percent of
the time but I really try to put a lot
of thought into my reviews and really
analyze and think about it I 4th grade
science we do science fair so you know
really thinking about those independent
and dependent variables you know making
sure that I'm only changing one thing so
if I'm using skincare only change one
thing at a time so that there's any
problems or reactions I always I know
that it's attributed to that one product
that I changed you know when I test a
lip product or something making sure
that i only use that lip product and no
gloss and no base or anything so that i
know how that lip product affects my
lips you know by itself and its not
attributed to anything else if I feel
like something interferes with my use of
it you know maybe it rained and water
got on my foundation I throw away that
review you know for that day I don't
count it and I try it again the next day
I mean I really put a lot of thought in
my view so I try to make them as
accurate to my personal opinion as
possible I try to really you know make
sure that that I'm doing the review
justice and giving you accurate
information as far as my opinion so I
think that makes a really big difference
as far as providing accurate reviews so
I really really appreciate that a lot
and thank you so much glad you put a lot
of time and thought into it and I'm glad
that it's working so thank you ok let's
see yodelin hi caitlin good to see you
again good morning watch your old how to
make money on youtube video have you got
me right have you any have any of your
recommendations changed since you made
it I haven't watched that video in a
long time I get a lot of comments on it
but I am actually watched all the way
through in a while how to make money on
youtube I think mostly that video a lot
of that is just giving information about
how people make money on YouTube and a
lot of that is the same the only thing
that's different is that people are
judged by well I don't know you know
what I hate to even say because I don't
want to miss speak and I haven't seen I
haven't actually watched a video all the
way through in a really long time but as
far as making money on youtube I mean
really what it comes down to his views
how many views you have and you can get
more views in lots of different ways but
the view counts is what earns you your
money so it doesn't matter how many
subscribers you have it doesn't matter
you know how many likes you have what
can get money they get you more views is
watch time the longer people watch your
video the more the the cooler you look
in the YouTube algorithm so you're more
likely to be promoted by YouTube and the
YouTube machine if your videos have a
lot of watch time so and then that gets
you more views which gets you more money
so I've learned a little bit here and
there about making making my uniyah to
that wasn't in that video but overall is
pretty much the same also the the money
thing that I talk about in a video talk
about you know that if for every
thousand you get a dollar for every
thousand views um that pretty much you
know it's a dollar for every thousand
views which isn't true it's actually
three dollars for every thousand views
is closer to what I make so it's a lot I
mean if for for you know being a side
job you know if you think about those
people that have a million views on a
video that's three thousand dollars but
when you think about how much time it
takes to create like a what's up and
make up i make about nine to ten dollars
off of what's up and make up and it
takes me about 10 hours so you know a
dollar an hour isn't so good and you
know most youtube people make way less
than minimum wage i know i do make way
way less than minimum wage so you know
it's more of a it's a it's a side thing
for most people but very few people can
make a living off of youtube videos so
hopefully i didn't go off too much all
right good morning from becky that is it
back or becky i think it's becky um good
morning to you Susan yay she says she
has 500 subscriptions I believe you I
totally believe you yeah you're named
Nicole hi Nicole oh yay or nay Nicole I
have to change that Nate and it's not
yay or nay wit nicole is yay or nay
Nicole now I have to change that in my
mind good morning Jan I saw the Urban
Decay have some stuff on hautelook
yesterday mainly eyeliner on one lip
pencil and also the pulp fiction palette
yeah I was a gay urban decay but Urban
Decay when they are on hautelook it's
stupid if you don't know how look at
flash sale website you totally need to
check it out because they have all kinds
really cool deals if you've ever seen
the pulp fiction palette by urban decay
it's the stupidest look and palate I
don't know what they were thinking like
they shouldn't they couldn't totally
made that thing so much better like I
don't know what that thing was I was on
vacation last summer and I got the email
for that from urban decay you know they
sent off the emails and I looked at and
I was like are they serious are they
serious I remember exactly where I was
when I saw the pulp fiction palette for
the first time blacks what is that like
the stupidest looking palette ever like
it was expensive too i think it was like
thirty-five dollars for for eyeshadows
or something and there are these little
teeny tiny little squares I don't know
but yeah and then eyeliners nobody uses
not nobody but a liquid eyeliners people
aren't using them as much I actually saw
the pink um Woodstock eyeliner at
nordstrom rack for four dollars you know
I mean just very weak weak showing by
urban decay on how look weak showing
which they actually put something good
on there that'd be amazing alright but
anyway moving on yeah but I did see that
Annette says finally purchased the Becca
foundation and while it was beautiful
upon application it was horrible um
we're separated every time I tried using
it returning ooh going to get the tart
foundation I have the back of foundation
I'm not sure this is the same one you
have met but I can't wear it this is the
one that I got this is the radiant skin
satin finish foundation I accent I
ordered it online and it's way too dark
for me I mean this is like eight shades
too dark for me it's just I don't let me
switch to my camera view so i can make
sure you can see this because i want you
to see this this is just I don't know
what I was thinking I mean seriously
like how in the world is that what what
was I thinking what what was I thinking
what is that ok this is in the shade
bamboo I don't know I don't know what I
was thinking so I can't use it I've
mixed it in a little bit with other I'm
switching back over to my other view
I've mixed in with other foundations a
little bit here and there to try to at
least get some idea of how it works but
I can't use it waste of money can't use
argh uh so I'm glad I'm not missing out
on that much that's good to know my
husband actually got the tart foundation
because you know my husband's all-metro
he has the chart foundation and I had to
use this either because it's his um but
I should use this suspect he's a little
bit darker naturally than I am so i'll
have to wait until I soft had a little
bit more before I can use that but
that'll probably match me once I self to
him a little bit more alright flaca says
you got to try Jake at products see I'm
this is the thing Jake at made a mistake
with me not not me personally but the
very first Jake at product I tried was
from an Ipsy bag and it was the most
terrible eyeshadow palette like it was
it was horrible it was like this I don't
know if you all remember this going back
a while FC fans or ypsi subscribers it
was the squares and they were glitter
and it was like dollar store like
glitter eyeshadow where it had like the
glitter on the top and then there was
like a cream underneath it was weird
like it was like the cheapest most
horrible eyeshadow palette I have ever
gotten in a subscription everybody was
complaining about it like I think that
I'm hoping that they've changed things
since then this was like a year or two
ago this a long time ago but I'm feeling
like they've changed things because I do
like the lip paints and I haven't tried
a lot since then so I'm not like jumping
on the jcat train but now since you're
telling me the jcat is good now I'm
feeling like I need to try some more and
give it more of a chance so thank you
for that flag um la winter is what are
you wearing on your eyes for what's up
and makeup off point girl thank you so
much it was a mix of some things I'm
trying to remember what I use i think it
was mostly yeah it was most of the lorac
mega Pro I used I don't know if you guys
can see this i'm going to try to hold it
up i use the apricot on my lid and then
i use sands in my inner court in like
the inner third and then i use vanilla
in my inner corner highlight and then i
used maroon i think in my crease and
then it wasn't dark enough and i didn't
want to use granite so i used something
else what did I use oh you know when i
use i know what i used
couldn't find it in that palette what I
wanted it should be right here yeah for
to darken up my outer corner my crease I
use the Milani Bella espresso I really
like these eyeshadows I don't show them
nearly enough love they're really really
nice I shadows I really like these a lot
so that's what I use from my eye shadow
and then my tart eyeliner and I had fake
lashes on for the first time and I hope
nobody notices you're all gonna notice
now but one of my eyelashes was coming
off like not even four minutes into the
video my eyelash on once I think it's
this side starts like peeling off a
little bit there are the ardell
self-adhesive eyelashes and they're not
self adhesive they totally lied so it's
not my fault my lashes were coming off a
little bit it's our Dells fault because
they said their self adhesive and
they're not so before I went out on date
night I took some lash glue when I glue
them on but I was mad when I went to go
look at that video because I did not
have time to refill mitt so hopefully
nobody noticed now you're gonna notice
but you know whatever I was hoping
people could look past it you know so
I'm glad you thought it was good i
really was so proud of that I look too
and then I lashes was like peeling off a
little bit like her but thank you so
much that really means a lot to me
because I've I didn't start where where
where I feel like I'm going as far as
eyeshadow application I've been I've
been trying really hard to improve so
let's see nikki says are giving a mini
sample packet for three shades of the
new chief face foundation with any order
now ah that's what that is that the new
to face foundation the one what is it I
don't know what it was called I have it
right here the all right was it calling
on I'm go past selfies that's the
selfies past the selfies past the
selfies ah I lost it I lost through
where did it go I don't know what
happened to my picture I lost it but
anyway the new to face foundation
they're giving out the three samples
that's really cool thank you for that
Nikki I appreciate it Jackie says good
morning from Massachusetts good morning
to you Jackie Chelsea says sleek
cosmetics do you deliver to the US if
over a certain price if you order from
the website we definitely recommend if
you want to try some more drugstore
eyeshadow and washes thank you chelsea i
will definitely
to check that out I just have such a
stupid amount of makeup unless I have a
specific plan for what I'm ordering um I
just I'm not buying I'm trying not to
buy as much makeup but um once I get
into the summer and I don't have as much
work to do because I'm a teacher so I'm
all for the summer hopefully I'll be
able to do more videos and be able to
order some stuff from sleek so if it's
gonna happen for sleek it's gonna happen
this summer so mental note request from
Chelsea for sleek cosmetics I got your
girlfriend a mental note I'm gonna try
alright flaca I'm so going to church
okay she's talkin to Nicki mrs. michelle
lee please shout me out hello mrs.
michelle lee she loves my videos thank
you I appreciate you being here thank
you so much let's see Michelle says
jen's you have you own or have any
experience with tart lipsticks thinking
about trying their sweet kisses lip set
from Ulta that has three lips again yes
I do have two of them and they're not
amazing I hate to tell you but they're
not amazing um I have to this one is in
angelic nude and then I have one more
that's like a coral color and where did
he go it's not here it's probably on a
purse somewhere or something I mean I
like the shades the shades are nice but
they're not very they're minimally
moisturizing they're not drying I know
but they're minimally moisturizing the
lasting power is pretty average typical
I don't think there any better than
drugstore lipsticks I think that the
packaging is super cute and they smell a
little bit minty you have a little bit i
don't remember them having like a minty
feeling see now i feel like i need to
put this on okay all right i got to put
this on so I can feel it cuz I gotta
test this out for you girlfriend all
right okay well I guess our kind of
moisture it's moisturizing I lied see
that's why I have to try things he now
I've got makeup on oh my hair well Lou
let's fix that alright cuz it didn't
look bad when I first started but it's
like human in here all right there we go
okay but anyway it is moisturizing
it's not better than my favorite
drugstore lipsticks let's say that
because there could be some drugstore
lipsticks that are pretty drawing um but
this one is pretty much rising I do know
that the where time is not phenomenal on
it my dog scratching his colors jingling
um yeah the where time isn't fantastic
the color if you really like the colors
i would say go for it um but this isn't
a lipstick that I would say you must own
if that makes sense but if the colors
are calling to you I think that you will
enjoy them uh I hope that helps no that
no I know I'm like way too high no
comments and I got 20 minutes left so
you know I I go as fast as I can go hmm
so let me know Michelle what you think
if you get them uh you know I mean again
they're they're nice but they're not
like like you have to get these sucka
says Alta coupon doesn't let you get
high end makeup that's very true and
then Nikki put the altar code up there
let's see some fish out of water good
morning good morning to you Kristin says
she has super oily lids and she has a
duo primer method she finds the Urban
Decay primer potion with the Mac Paint
Pot in painterly works like a charm for
her thank you so much Kristen for that
thank you okay Christy says oh shoot I
finally make it to chat and now my
device won't play it hi Jen hi Christy
it's good to see you Chris day yay um
yeah I mean it should be able to play it
but it's probably as you're not I'm
surprised you can comment or maybe
you're not maybe you switched over
devices maybe you're on a desktop or
laptop now Michelle said oh oh i already
got that one okay Nicole's talking to
Nikki did it admit it nikki says the
code ever this is what this was awhile
ago okay Susan says she doesn't have
eyelids but she loves the estee lauder
double wear eye primer so that's another
suggestion Judy says good morning from
Canada good morning to you Judy Michelle
says Jen what lower-end lipstick should
I invest in lower and lipstick meaning
drugstore I'm assuming uh you know I'm
actually in the process of testing a
bunch of drug store matte lipsticks
right now
that I ordered all together and with the
oldest ale so I used last night was the
first one that I use this was the NYX
matte lipstick this is in the color
strawberry daiquiri I really like this
it wore really nicely I was surprised
excuse me another one that I really like
I really like the Rimmel lipsticks is
this one yep is that it no nope this is
a different one okay horniman where's my
Rimmel airy-fairy why anyway the Rimmel
lipsticks are really nice i like those a
lot the Milani ones have a really really
strong smell so if you don't like strong
smells you won't like the Milani ones
these are nice what is this this is are
you not gonna put your brand name on
here oh no this is Rimmel the his realm
alright this is chi nude or not to nude
I really like the rubble lipsticks a lot
oh let's see mmm i like i like the UM
the revlon butter lipsticks those are
nice you say anything else that stands
out to me as far as drug store those are
kind of my favorites I've heard a lot to
do things let me get this one people are
telling me that I'm going to love these
people tell me that I'm going to love
these these are the the maybelline matte
lipsticks this one's in touch of spice
and this one is in lust for blush I've
heard that these are fantastic I have
not tried them yet but I'm really
looking forward to try needs I've heard
that these are awesome so that's that
yay let's see MMG sera hi there kisses
from Buenos Aires Argentina so exciting
oh let's see like I said she spent over
five hundred dollars should make up this
weekend and now she's broke well I would
imagine that's a lot holy moly
girlfriend I hope you got some good
stuff Kimberly says what's your favorite
lip gloss my favorite lip glosses are
the NYX butter glosses the original ones
i love these those are my absolute
favorites by far i love them let's see
kristen talking about the eyelid thing
Christie said the song and a sarah
jessie hello from indiana hello Jessie
yay Christie says it's working now that
makes me happy okay dinnae is ok Emily
do you think the lorac Pro is worth it
and which one would you recommend the
first one the second one I don't own the
first one but i can tell you i love the
second one I really think that when it
comes down to with the lorac pros is
which one which color range apply you
know calls to you more this one calls to
me more just because i have so many
neutral eyeshadow cows and this one is
more interesting so if you don't have a
big makeup collection and you like
natural looks i would say go for the
first one but if you have a big makeup
collection or if you like to add a
little pizzazz ensure i look i would say
go for the second one definitely nikki
says my first ran diversity of my
boyfriend was on friday i dropped some
last-minute hints and my boyfriend
ordered me the ud the vault inside oh he
didn't oh you got the vault oh and if
you got the world oh are you serious oh
oh my goodness that's so exciting I'm so
jealous you guys know the Urban Decay
vault the one with the three I shop
house and the three blush palettes and
the three lip liners and three lipsticks
in the oh I'm dying over here I'm dying
I'm vicariously living through you Nikki
oh my goodness huh oh you have a nice
boyfriend maritza hi maritza greetings
from sunny Mexico just wanting your
favorite IM products that are worth the
price tag um see this is the thing
high-end products are worth the price
tag honestly I don't think any makeup is
worth high-end prices for the most part
I mean the only thing like i said i said
think i said this last week the only
thing that I feel like is totally worth
the fifty dollars i paid for this was
the naked too i feel like this was worth
every bit of that fifty dollars every
bit like i would part repurchase this
over and over and over and over again
that being said i don't feel like even
though these are my favorite lipsticks
easy to the chart look creme lip sticks
these are twenty-five dollars each
do I need a $25 lipstick no i don't i
love this it's my fave but is it truly
worth twenty-five dollars no yeah hey
it's like I can tell you my favorite
high-end stuff and be happy to do that
but I don't feel like any of it is truly
worth the price I mean I just got this
one this is the Marc Jacobs lipstick and
this is an eat cake from the new nudes
collection love this lipstick it's one
of my new favs I love it was it worth
thirty dollars heck no it was not worth
thirty dollars a thirty dollars is like
the price of a meal not a lipstick so
that's my opinion totally that answers
your question I mean Aisha's I don't
know a meal for a family of four all
right you know not a meal form of one
person you know like seriously like I
could feed my whole family for the price
this lipstick you know stupid stupid
it's stupid but it's fun it's fun it
could be crack it could be lip it could
be cigarettes I get lipstick all right
uh let's see where I was talking about
doing a declutter video Jessie says she
loves decluttering videos katie says Kat
Von D's Essex it's discontinued no it's
not no I'm sorry if I just yelled and I
just totally blew out your ears if you
have headphones on Kat Von Teese assets
is discontinued don't tell me that I'm
gonna cry are you serious now I have to
use it like well I'm gonna it's gonna go
bad what am I gonna do it's my favorite
are you serious I'm gonna cry okay you
just broke my heart you totally broke my
heart oh my goodness all right I have to
move on from this I have to move on from
this I have to let my heart settle I
can't believe he just told me that I'm
gonna cry I'm not gonna cry I'm not
gonna cry I'm gonna hold it together for
the bid for this I'm not gonna cry in
front of you i'll cry once they go out
of the camera but I'm not gonna cry
right now okay but anyway um I am really
upset about though that's that's
terrible I'm very sad to hear that
Jessica
says she loves decluttering videos okay
awesome so I do some of those Caroline
says declutter Jen says who doesn't need
to declutter I know right I see Marlene
says she loves decluttering videos plus
i'm moving i need to lighten my load
that's true Christy says it's sometimes
okay sometimes she doesn't recognize
makeup forever either i don't know what
that is i miss i I'm so far past when we
were talking about that that I totally
lost the Tramp about on that one Emily
says decluttering yes Tyler hi Tyler she
says definitely do the decluttering
jessica says good morning good morning
Jessica nikki says yes for the
decluttering Mariana says hey hey
Mariana uh let's see flaca is everybody
saying yes to the decluttering so I'm
gonna have to do some of those Carrie
says what do you consider doing a
project pan or products I want to use up
no I haven't I'm not going to project
pan I will probably never do project pan
because this is the problem I am NOT
problem but this is the deal i am
constantly reviewing new products so
that means i'm constantly switching
things up if i didn't have a beauty
channel i could totally do it but I
can't commit to one product long enough
to hit pan on it like that's just not
what I do with makeup I don't try to use
things up on purpose it's I use products
in order to test them that's what I do
so I don't do project pan because then
well and also I'm very fickle and I get
bored really quickly and I would just be
bored to tears you know trying to use
our products like that so no I won't do
that that's just not me but there's lots
of people who do um you know lots of
people have some time I'm not going to
do that because it's just not it's not
functional for me and my channel to do
project pan but I will do empties videos
though I need to do another empties
videos I think I only did one and then
I've got a whole drawer full of trash
that's just sitting there waiting to do
an empties video that I will do um let's
see Marianas is I always miss you so
excited so excited to have you here
Mariana and lisa says good morning from

with you uh Mariana any makeup tips
today is my prom I'm worried about my
makeup lasting love you okay makeup tips

settings brief you got one uh use
long-lasting products it's hard for me
because you're just going today i think
i could give you lots and lots and lots
of suggestions on things to products to
buy things to use as far as making
things last longer but like it's kind of
late for you to go shopping uh don't
sweat um yeah i don't i don't know like
I mean there's only a lot of products i
would recommend that you get if you're
trying me a long-lasting look but oh my
goodness have fun at prom have a great
time I'm I have let my remember my prom
I had a lot of fun at my problem I went
my best friend I didn't have a boyfriend

a great time yeah and that was a fun
time in my life that was a lot of fun
but anyway moving on Lebanon enough
reminiscing have a great time at your
prom girlfriend have a great time uh
let's see Nikki Oh Nikki started
something else Christi I'm a little
obsessed with project panning a lot of
people are and I'm just not i'm not into
it that's just a personal thing they're
very very popular videos though savannah
says do you think the mimi box is worth
it I used to think it was worth it and
then they change their system and now I
don't know
I don't know I haven't gotten one since
they changed from not having as many
Korean brands that's not sure they do
saw the Korean brands but they don't
ship directly from Korea or something
like that something changed and now it
seems to be more expensive so now I
don't know but honestly I've loved I
loved getting Nene boxes the products I
have just had so much fun with the
product so I would say it's definitely
worth getting once final box that you're
really interested in getting it once
trying it out I think that's definitely
worth it absolutely something shot of
water love the nails wraps or stamps
these are stamps um so what I have on
here right now i'll show you I got this
this I think I got in my recent boxy
charm was an inbox each arm let me see
I've got all my subscription boxes here
I got like four for subscription boxes
all the same day yep I got this in my
boxy charm for may and I love this this
is the main color and then this actually
the other color is actually a julep
yellow but it didn't come out as yellow
it ended up coming out is just another
shade of that tle kind of color like the
peachy kind of collar and I think it
came out great i'm really happy with it
the stamping plate is from born pretty
store and yes i was very excited about
this it's already chipping though so i'm
really upset about this i've only had it
on for like two days and it's already
starting chipped but yes they are stamps
let's say pure mineral soul mates so
nice of a little ova okay she's out in
your two cents about the premium pure
mineral soulmates what is that oh is
that the bronzer I don't know if
soulmates is that's a that's a I'm
getting confused because two fates has
the soul mates heart bronzer thing I
don't know but Kristin says she's um
she's loving this pure mineral soul
mates whatever oh the matte palette
fantastic and Kristin tries a lot of
palette so I definitely back her up on
drew % she says something's good go with
it Grady said i would love decluttering
series and i thank you for the blush
recommendations I've so many blushes is
kind of insane wedding planning is
coming along great early September okay
I thought she was getting married in
June but it's September but still that's
coming up quick girlfriend Marlene says
picked up the hard candy birthday suit
palette all Matt having mixed results I
think it's user error not product fault
no girlfriend no I i bet you i would bet
you five bucks that it is not user error
i would bet you that its product error
because some products really truly are
easier to work with than others and i
would imagine that it's the product
that's that's my thought I'm not I'm
gonna blame the product I'm not blaming
you Marlene but I haven't tried it so
you know but that's interesting so the
hard candy birthday soup hell I'll have
to check that out and see what I think
about it mm-hmm all right Jen what okay

Eleanor hey good morning I can't seem to
find a good foundation the one I
currently use is the mac studio fix a
lot of people really like that
foundation I think that's what it's
called I want to find an affordable one
and love your videos okay I mentioned
this a little bit earlier but not
everybody was here this is my favorite
foundation right now this well drugstore
foundation this is the Maybelline matte
and poreless this is only for oily oily
to normal skin do not get this at this
dry skin dry skin it sticks to dry
patches don't get that for that but this
is my favorite drugstore now the one
that I really like that isn't a
foundation is really good as the looming
CC cream really love that one as far as
high-end goes someone's that I really
love I've been falling back in love with
my Marc Jacobs this is it more in bisque
light this is the marvelous moose I've
been falling back in love with that I
really like that a lot this is my
favorite high-end foundation this is the
hourglass immaculate liquid powder
foundation this is in the shade nude
this is my fav it's amazing you know
I've never tried the mac foundation
because when I go into Mac I don't enjoy
the way the people that that that work
at Mac I don't enjoy that like really
perfect flawless look like that like
where it's all one tone like really
really perfect like I don't enjoy that
look I feel like it looks kind of manic
in E and that's just not something I
enjoy myself so I've never tried the
foundation because i'm assuming if i buy
the foundation i'm going to look like
that and i don't want to look like that
so i could be wrong
never tried it I don't know but you know
but those would be my recommendations
for foundations let's see okay you a
task for an affordable one so they for
Bo one would be if you have um you have
normal to oily skin I would say the fit

I'll get to it uh Christy I've always
loved your videos from day one
backgrounds media Thank You Christy
Christy has been around for ever Christy
nystrom they have the wind I think I'm
saying it right she's been a subscriber
mine forever forever Marlene I don't
give a horse's hind me about the
background thank you all right black is
talking about my bathroom I have no plug
in my bathroom it sucks it does suck Amy
says how are you I'm good thank you Amy
how are you Susan said I'd rather watch
someone real in the perfect background
thank you I don't think a lot of people
agree with us though I'm with you I I
feel like you know you know people in
the beauty community are very into
aesthetics because it's all about beauty
and looks and so so it makes sense that
everybody would really really love a
beautiful background and a beautiful
perfect face and beautiful perfect hair
and it makes sense but sometimes those
videos aren't as useful sometimes but
people will subscribe anyway because
they see this beautiful beautiful
everything because its beauty that's
what we're here for is beauty so it
doesn't surprise me makes me a little
sad but it doesn't surprise me hey um
lisa says she thinks my background is
fine thank you Lisa and then viola loca
777 your background is fine don't know
how you feel about doing vids outside
but that's always fun i did shoot
outside for one summer I shot outside on
my porch but then there's all the noise
from the street cuz I live on a
relatively busy street so there's noise
from the street and the animal noises
and everything Susan films outside and
it looks beautiful when she films
outside alright let's see Nina says the
morning from Tennessee I lost the what
just happened okay what's after 11

lost where I was and it's going to take
me five minutes to find where i was so

gonna have to cut it off here I'm so
sorry I know we didn't get to a lot of
