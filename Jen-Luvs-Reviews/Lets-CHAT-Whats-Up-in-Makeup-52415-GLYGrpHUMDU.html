to chat with you guys this morning about
everything makeup all right I want to go

watches it live so let me go ahead and

can find it really quickly ah let's see
I'm trying to find it without it being
boring I hope you all enjoyed the chat
this of the chat I hope you all enjoyed
it the video this morning it seems like
the makeup world is kind of slowed down
on the brand new products a bit which is
fine i mean we had so many we had so
many new releases for spring and then
the summer was like right on top of it
like it was like no break so it's
exciting to me to UM to see kind of like
a break in it so that we can basically
like it seems like it's just all kits
right now as far as new makeup um now I
can I'm so upset that it's not there ah
I can't find it sheshe was said
basically she watches ah this video back
she can participate the chat but she had
a question and it was a long involved
question um let me see I'm gonna look
just a little bit more and if I can't
find it I'm gonna just kind of go with
what I remember I just get so many
emails it's really hard to find things
and she sent it early in the week
yeah I don't know but um I know one of
the things was you know if I was going
to create my own makeup what ingredients
would I be careful not to include and my
products at nessas the thing i would
definitely want to try I mean this is a
thing I don't know anything about
creating a makeup line I don't know
anything about creating makeup so um you
know I would have to consult with people
that knew more than me I would have to
consult people who would know hi Maeve
it's all crinkling over here okay it's
getting his new sock sounds abandoned to
their um it would have to I would just
have to consult with people I mean I
feel like I'm not educated enough in
makeup ingredients for me to know the
answer to that question as far as what i
would put in my makeup i'm still trying
to find it and i'm really sad that i
can't find it so my friend that set me
the email i will do better next week
about trying to be more prepared I was
getting the kids breakfast and I just
completely forgot to pull it up so I
don't want to spend too long on this but

get to the beginning of the chat it's
loading now okay there we go okay it
looks like Chelsea is the first person
good morning love from ireland's so
exciting you're supposed to
Ireland but we can't because we're
saving for a house but we were supposed
to Ireland for our second hangman but
it's not gonna work out but I'm jealous
you actually live there oh my goodness I
right what are the best practice for
scars and stretch marks I don't have any
products that have worked for me for
scars and stretch marks I do it did have
a mole removed over here in this area
that we thought with skin cancer at one
point or could have been skin cancer and
it wasn't um and I tried a bunch of
different things I don't think that I
tried a bunch of things for that and
nothing worked I don't remember off the
top of my head what products to use i
think i just bought like one or two
things and I just kind of gave up bones
like whatever and stretch marks I didn't
I was very lucky when I was pregnant not
to get a bunch of stretch marks oh I
wish that I had some ideas for that but
I don't unfortunately Chelsea but if
anybody knows some good products for
scars and stretch marks at Chelsea see
Hickey is her name hi Eleanor good
morning from London hopefully it's not
raining there I'm just this year
starting out with makeup and wondering
any products she would highly recommend
banks love your channel best youtuber
hands down thank you i had someone just
leave a comment a minute ago one of my
favorite subscribers saying basically
she's not a big fan of what's of a
makeup and she misses my other videos
and i'm trying really hard to put video
is up but my other job is just consuming
me right now i'm a fourth grade teacher
if you didn't know and it's just the
grading is outrageous right now and I
just feel like I owe it to those kids to
invest my time in that and unfortunately
that puts youtube videos a lot slower so
hopefully one day I'll be able to stop
teaching um even though I love teaching
I really would love to do YouTube full
time so hopefully I'll be able to do
that one day and then I can really
commit myself putting out more videos
but to answer your question let's see
any products I would recommend if you
like it comes on what your price ranges
and what you're looking for I mean
there's so many great products out there
so many great products if you're just
starting out and make up I would suggest
you get a neutral eyeshadow palette
because the thing is is if people aren't
used to want you seeing you wear makeup
they're going to be really freaked out
if you come with like heavy makeup even
if it looks amazing
thing they're going to be like what in
the world is Eleanor wearing like she
never wears makeup and now she's got all
this makeup on even looks beautiful so
get yourself a really good neutral
palette if you're going for a more
high-end I always recommend the Naked 2
or the original naked palette naked 3 is
kind of i've heard mixed things about
the naked 3 but it just kind of depends
on your card but for beginner i would
recommend even vaniqa to or the original
naked palette I know that's an
investment so if you are not in that
cheaper I'm depending on your colouring
the l'oreal will probably the the
palette 1 i absolutely love this it's
not as easy to work with as the naked
naked palettes but it's so doing nice
drugstore palette also yeah that's not
even going back in my thing let me say
this also if you don't even want to
invest that much this is really nice
this is the wet and wild comfort zone
palette this was a really nice starter
pellet it also tells you exactly where
to put the different things so you've
got a brow bone eyelid crease and define
and you've got a few different choices
here so this is a really good one to get
if you're just starting out with
eyeshadow as far as eyeliner the Justice
girl eyeliner is my favorite it's my
whole Grail liquid eyeliner i do not
recommend pencil eyeliners for beginners
i feel like there are a lot harder teams
unless you're using it on your lower
lash line but these pen liners are
amazing this is my fav and well kind of
this is my favorite drugstore one i have
to say that the tort one is actually my
favorite favorite I think I talked about
this last week someone spend too much
time on it but this is the tart multiply
my Jesse Scrolls getting a little bit
old but you can just see the difference
in the fine line I mean just well I just
discuss my Jesse Scrolls getting old but
these pan liners are amazing you know
those are some things that I would start
with mascaras there's a lot of really
good drugstore mascaras the UM the
butterfly mascara the l'oreal butterfly
mascara it doesn't matter which one one
of those those are amazing they seem to
be get positive reviews no matter what
another good mascara for beginners is oh
you every
this is another good one this is the
Maybelline lash sensational this was
really really good as well but those
would be some some mace makeup basic
kinds of things I could go on and on
about my favorite like products but I
want to get to some more questions but
those are just some basics justins of
things that I would recommend so
hopefully that helps you Eleanor H
razzle-dazzle good morning Jan just got
back from what's up in makeup was
wondering if you have a favorite
affordable brand of makeup brushes I'm
looking for some quality ones that won't
blow a bang etho tools eco tools are
amazing i love ecotools brushes
especially their eye shadow brush set
it's fantastic their face brushes are
not quite dense enough for me so if
you're going to go for face brushes i
would say real techniques that real
technique I brushes are really good too
but I think they're a little bit more
expensive so um you know those are
definitely my favorite to favorite um
lower less expensive eyeshadow brush
brands also some of the elf brushes are
really really good believe it or not
again I think the eyeshadow brushes are
a little easier to make because they
require less bristles like I feel like
it's you know I don't less expensive
products cause less expects expensive
gosh can I speak ha um it's easier I
think to create a really good eye shadow
brush then it is a really good face
brushes because I guess I'm the number
of bristles that requires but I'd like
elf has some really good practice while
I really like elf blush brush but then
we go for their studio line that's the
one the three dollars versus a dollar
there are some good dollar ones but I
feel like if you want to be safe go for
the three dollar ones so hopefully that
helps let's see I Jenna Chelsea says
Jenna also forgot to ask how are you
today it's a warm one for once in I
learned Ireland it's warm here too it's
a beautiful day out and I'm doing great
I'm doing fantastic thank you for asking
Caitlyn said weds is a start right now
girlfriend Chelsea says we'll probably
start soon it's been over Jen tunes and
yet ten o'clock I might have been a few
seconds late a man it says Jack I'm
morning I won't be able to watch this
video go live but I'll watch later
what's your view on the
drama that happened last week with man
emu a gen Gerard and Karina kaboom I
personally thought it was immature
kareena wasn't being bashful to the
company I will never buy from that
company I mean 20 books from Radio
lipstick when I can buy mac for 16 and
good quality drugstore brands wet and
wild Rimmel etc for four dollars to ten
dollars come on that's ridiculous okay
so I knew this was going to come yeah I
knew this was going to come up and I've
been talking to John Wall week about
this about what I want to do about this
question because like okay listen this
is kind of what i want to say about that
if you don't know about the drama about
that i don't want to spend a whole lot
of time on it because i know a lot of
people don't care and it's kind of old
news at this point i mean it happened
like tuesday so people are kind of like
done with this topic but i do want to
since you asked amanda i will express
kind of where I what I feel about it so
basically what happened is Manny mua was
sitting in the home of Gerard who is the
owner of Troy cosmetics and they were
snacking Manny was snapchatting and
supposedly Jen didn't know about it i'm
not sure if i'd buy that but supposedly
jen didn't know about it and he
snapchatted them watching my friend
karina she is my friend actually the
only thing was two weeks ago as people
asked what my favorite youtubers were
and I mentioned Karina and I was like
Karina love you but you're a little
angry like it was kind of me for what I
had said in that video um you know when
it because it's true I mean Karina it's
honest she's really honest but she gets
passionate and something a product makes
her man she will go off about and she
just went off about to our cosmetics and
she was cussin and I went I totally went
off topic one of it let me finish
talking about Karina and then we'll go
back to what happened with Manny so
karinas costantini she's calling it
these horrible names these products I
mean she just went off about the product
how terrible was and the reason why she
did is because she had an allergic
reaction so that's just Karina Karina is
honest she's really honest you get what
you get with Karina um and I love her
for that I absolutely love Karina for
that but some people think that she's a
bit much that's their opinion I have an
opinion I lover something about my
opinion they don't love her so it's
anyway so Manny and Jen the owner of
drug cosmetics are watching Korean
video when you see carinos you know on
the phone and background and basically
this womans you know she's really trying
us and he says and then jen says yeah
the ugliest you know something so manny
says she said the ugliest personality i
personally don't feel like that fits in
the context maybe jen just wasn't
speaking in context I don't know but to
me it sounded like the ugliest person
like almost like you know we're watching
this person on YouTube who's bashing my
products and she happens to be the
ugliest person who's bashing my makeup
products so I don't know that's that's
what it seemed like to me that she said
the ugliest person okay so what this
comes down to is there's three things
that are happening here the first thing
is about Manny the only reason why you
care about the Manny part is if you
actually care about Manny you don't care
about nanny and it doesn't matter it
doesn't matter basically what we learned
about Manny from this experience because
I nailed I've not nailed him but I like
went at him on Twitter as far as the
questions like I was investigating on
Twitter with him and he was talking to
me which was awesome and I commend him
for talking to me I really do because he
could have totally more me and I was
basically Barbara Walters in him I was
like you know so you meant this but then
you kind of said this please clarify you
know I was very respectful and basically
what we learned is that man he makes fun
of people sometimes just like a lot of
people too um Manny feels like because a
lot of people make fun of people that he
feels like he did nothing wrong in
making fun of her where he feels like he
made a mistake was publishing that video
he does not feel like um saying that
about Karina on snapchat was bad it was
just well no I don't want to say that he
this is where it gets sticky because
this is live right um so basically he
feels bad about posting video he's
gotten Jen in trouble he's gotten
himself in trouble a lot of people took
it personally it was this huge
controversy they're comparing at the
lime crime all of this um but if you
don't care that me and he makes fun of
people um and you
Oh care that man he doesn't have a
problem putting that he makes fun of
people on the internet then it doesn't
matter I don't think man he's a bad
person I feel like if I were Manny's age
I might have done something similar when
I was Manny's age he's a young guy he's
a college kid so I mean I don't think
that's unusual behavior for someone his
age if he was my age I would say wow
that dude is immature but I feel like
it's age-appropriate what he did um you
know was it appropriate no it was
completely inappropriate but I don't I
don't think he's a bad person I really
don't i just think that that you know he
was being a college kid you know that's
my opinion alright so that's as she
number 1 i'm going to try to move on
from this within the next five minutes
issue number two is gender rd gen Gerard
called one of her customers ugly
straight-up called her ugly uh I live
personality ugly it doesn't matter
doesn't matter she called him up Kohler
ugly also there was a video that was put
out around the same time where there was
somebody that lived in Ireland's high of
my Irish Fred somebody lived in Ireland
ordered some products from Gerard
cosmetics and she said that the customer
service was terrible I won't go into her
whole situation but basically I had to
do with the customs and it sounded like
they were basically trying to blow her
off by starting the email with hey
beautiful or hey gorgeous and then
saying something that was not helpful
you know what I mean like it was like
that kind of tactic like it just left a
bad taste in my mouth and then with you
know conquering ugly like I understand
Corina said ugly things I get that but
as a business owner like excuse me oh my
goodness ok sorry my kids are arguing so
it so anyway so as a business owner what
I would do if I'd seen Korea's video is
I would have probably been like oh my
gosh and my stomach look what his son I
would have felt sick and then I would
have contacted Karina directly and been
like oh my goodness I'm so sorry you had
an allergic reaction what can we do to
make this right not call her ugly you
know what I mean like it's just my
daughter's just upset I hopefully
hopefully get here her I don't know she
just she's upset right now
um but she'll be fun my husband's taken
care of it he's over there taking care
of her um say anyway ah so that's kind
of how I feel like that so if you were
never planning on buying for Gerard
cosmetics and that shouldn't matter to
you whether Jen called ugly or not now
the third issue is the one that was
brought up by Vanessa that is rad about
the contract that people sign in order
to promote our cosmetics basically
vanessa was sent a contract from Gerard
cosmetics that said that she must do a
positive review Vanessa did not son I
think I don't think she signed it
actually I don't know if she's on it or
not I don't think she did though but
Vanessa got this contract either way now
does that mean that every single person
that works with drori cosmetics gets one
of those contracts it does we don't know
we don't know whether everyone did all
we know is that Vanessa got a contract
saying that should we give a positive
review of their products um so does that
make every youtuber that that talks
about droid cosmetics shady no it
doesn't um is it possible I don't know
that's up to you to decide um this is
the thing that there's a big difference
between guaranteeing a positive review
and guaranteeing that you won't say
anything negative there's a huge
difference because I could get you know
these illamasqua nail polishes I just
got off of a look that I'm so excited
about okay I thought these am asking
elvish let's pretend like illamasqua
sent these to me they didn't but let's
pretend okay I like all of them except
for one of them okay I do not like this
one so if I sign that contract with
illamasqua I would not be allowed to
talk about this polish but I could talk
about these polishes okay because I
really genuinely like these so is that
being dishonest to omit information
about products you don't like that's up
to you to decide so anybody that would
care about this would be anybody that
watches anybody who's ever reviewed to
our cosmetics and you need to make the
twist about whether you trust those
people personally I still do I feel like
if anybody reviewed roars drawer
cosmetics and gave a positive review
that does not negate
as an honest review from me personally
um but that's up to you if you think
that that's too shady if you feel like
there's too much of a connection that's
on you for me personally I don't see
that being a deal breaker for me so
those are my thoughts on those three
issues I do want to move on from this
because I know there's a lot of other
questions have nothing to do with this
but if you want to leave comments under
this video after it's over if you want
to have a continuing conversation about
this I have no problem having contain
conversation about this but I do want to
move on as far as the topics of
discussion and hopefully that answered
your questions and I am very happy that
I got to voice my opinion on that
because I've been thinking about it all
week so let's go ahead and move on
though because not everybody cares about
that situation all right Thank You
Amanda for the question I knew it was
going to come up alright Sarah says good
morning from Kansas City need a
recommendation for liquid eyeliner
felt-tip pens Belgium what are you using
your video last week I'm digging these
that look these days um duh this one
like i was saying a minute ago before
actually after you type that the chart
multiplies what i've been loving lately
when my jesse's girl was brand new i
love this one but this is very hard to
come by another one that I like a lot is
the the Maybelline master precise is a
really good one I feel like this one has
the shortest lasting power Jesse's girl
in the middle and the tart has been very
very good to me but you know if you want
something that's easy accessible i would
say the Maybelline master precise i
absolutely love and one reason why i
like those two as I feel like they don't
bleed into my final lines so that's a
good thing all right Bradley hi Bradley
our I'm good how are you treating myself
to ring my bell abay benefit and an
urban decay revolution lip gloss in
Apocalypse the other day yeah that
sounds wonderful I don't know ring my
bell up I benefit I'll have to look that
up oh my goodness I don't know that
product i will look that up Bradley so
exciting and I hope you like the lip
gloss I i swatched them in the store and
I wasn't seen that magical but what I
don't know this I they seem a little
more magical than typical lip gloss I
have to say they did seem really nice
okay fine I want some all right I'm in
it I'm an addict I want some of those
rebel of field glasses I staff azilla
good morning everyone good morning to
you stabbed Alan tight kisses huh she's
actually a friend of my husband's she

actually gave John a bunch of a big box
of stuff to give me and I haven't had a
chance to like talk about those products
yet what's up jajaja zest you want to
show everybody your outfit come here he
said do I look handsome in this okay
here does he look handsome he wants to
know if he looks handsome I think you
look handsome I like the two wearing a
tank top I think that's the first time
you've worn a tank top this year oh yeah
yeah always looking at himself in the
mirror of a mirror over there okay good
he's very proud okay we're gonna go
ahead and put you down because I got to
finish talking to my friends okay All
Right see you later buddy okay Tom so
anyway she's got great blog I will put
it in the description of this after the
chat is over um so tell John the tattoo
he did the 1i one yes she want to tattoo
on Instagram is all healed up she enjoys
the goodies I guess I did enjoy the
goodies that you said home with them I'm
so sorry I haven't gotten back to you
about that girlfriend I did appreciate
them and I do love them thank you so
much for all that you try the new cover
girls they live miss foundation I am NOT
trying to get but I'm really really
really really want to all right thank
you for coming by I'm so excited to see
you yodeling says good morning Jen I
can't stick around long I just wanted to
hear your final thoughts on the droid
Manny stuff from last weekend I did just
went over that girlfriend so hopefully
that had to your question thanks for
asking all the questions on Twitter I
wanted answered good that was kind of
what i felt like i was doing like
sometimes I just feel like it's kind of
a job you know like if he was talking to
me you know might as well ask but some
people up so I did get quite a bit of
negativity on that baby oh my comments
on Twitter someone told me don't you
worry about Manny worry about your
eyebrows and then I realized that
morning I totally forgot to do my brows
I was like you know what she's kind of
right I mean the whole time I wasn't mad
for a second it was like you know it was
it's you know
it's really in the grand scheme of
things not that huge in the grand scheme
of things unless you are playing on
buying from Gerard cosmetics then to you
it might be a big deal in that context
but then you just don't buy from jar
cosmetics and you move on with your life
you know so whatever but yeah it was an
interesting day that day when I was on
Twitter all right Victoria what liquid
eyeliner should be i buy I just went
over those if you missed that um
definitely well I like the pan liners I
don't like the liquid brushy kinds they
are too much if you want one actually
i'll tell you one if you want an actual
real liquid eyeliner this one's really
good but it's not as easily accessible
where is it it's the phones one here it
is snow pretty boo my eyeliner feel like
a mess right now and i don't know that i
put things mmm but if the one by the
bottle here it is um the bomb schwing
eyeliner is really good if you like cut
this is like a mix-up it's like if a pen
and i'll lick what I letter had a baby
it's got the pen tip but then um it you
have to dip it like a liquid and it goes
on like a liquid I know I was like shaky
hand there but this is a really nice
like transition in the middle between a
pen and a liquid brush so that's a
really good one that I don't think I've
ever mention on the Twitter on the chat
before nikki says hi Jenna good morning
i hope you're having a good morning too
Denise says Jan what's up shanghai from
is everyone watching your videos keep
them coming thank you so much hopefully
i'll be able to increase my number of
videos very very soon within the next
month my last day of work is jun 18 to
anything NeNe box is worth it I feel
like many boxes something that everybody
should try once that's my personal
opinion it's a lot of fun but I think
you should wait until you see a box that
calls to you and it really is a lot of
fun and then if you like it and get more
um but but yes I definitely think it's
worth it even just to try one time
nicole says good morning good morning to
you dear Grady hi sweetheart good
morning you have a favorite sunscreen

this is my thing about sunscreen I just
started looking up into the
Environmental Working Group i think is
what it's called the ewg website and i
found out that my favorite sunscreen
which is the Banana Boat sunscreen is
like high up on the evil sunscreen list
so I need to find a new sunscreen and I
can tell you that I actually still have
the window up because I wanted to show
my husband the Banana Boat clear ultra
missed ultra defense max can protect
continuous spray sunscreen is on the is
on the list of the 11 worse susser a
sunscreen I was like the one I use but
if you go to ewg org you can find um you
know all the different sunscreens and
they're talking about you know inhaling
the sprays and also if we always use
sprays they said to make sure you stay
away from oxygen it can disrupt disrupt
the hormone system and retinol palmitate
which can trigger a trigger damage and
possibly cancer so those are some advice
you know to kind of jot down I know I
put them in my phone if things to look
out for when I buy a new sunscreen
because the one that i was using is not
good so I don't have one anymore I did
have one and I don't have it anymore so
yeah and they also said anything above
SPF 50 is stupid like SPF 50 as hot as
high as it goes it's just a marketing
thing above SPF 50 um totally that looks
a little bit crazy sorry I couldn't be
more specific Roxanne says good morning
good morning to you ms michelle lee gem
what brand of lipstick is a good deep
for Mac Mac you know this is the thing
about Mac Mac has so many different
formulas I don't think that there is one
dupe for Mac you know i mean because
they have the luster finish they have a
matte finish they have the creamy finish
they have all these different finishes
um so I don't know if you're ever going
to find a true deep format just because
they vary from lipstick to lipstick as
far as formula goes as far as shade
really depends on what shade if you
google whatever you're looking for if
you find a matte lipstick that you love
and you google dupes for it you'll be
able to find all kinds of dupes for
whatever shade you like temptalia.com is
a fantastic blog for dupes so if you go
to her website TMT al I a calm if you go
to her website and you type in whatever
product you're trying to do you'll be
able to find swatches of a ton of
different products to help you find oops
but as far as formula I don't know if
that's possible but hopefully Tattaglia
can help you when you're if you're
looking for something specific so
hopefully Michelle that helps a little
bit i'm sorry i can't be more specific
on that lauren says oh she's on the
sarah karina hi john i just want to say
i love you and thank you for everything
you've done for me and thank you for
being a friend I love you Karina I you
know I just I feel I feel bad that
Karina has gotten so much crap excuse
that word but she's got so much crap
over this week just like manny has just
like Vanessa hellas over that whole
situation and you know I just it's
stupid it's stupid how intense people
can get over something stupid I mean
really in the grand scheme of things
this this whole thing is such a small
small small thing and to have you know
supposedly vanessa was getting death
threats on her children and like
corrina's been getting attacked I mean
my friend Lily said Karina was getting
attacked on her Instagram I mean like
it's just it's stupid so I'm sorry you
had to go through all that i roll this
it's just stupid it's not even that big
of a deal hi baby where you leave him
John's going to the gym he's taking the
boy with him hi what's up amigo hi baby
buy us a few hours okay sounds good and
I'll um I'll bring my litter birthday
party and then we can text too yeah okay

morning then we're mean back up around
two ok so anyway Karina I love you and I

important thing and I thank you for

with lupus Jan good morning from from
carmel in utah yay have you heard
anything about using the new waterproof
cream shadows from ABH as waterproof
tight liners no I've heard the
highlighters from marc jacobs are good
too new that sounds amazing I will have
to look into that woohoo that sounds
awesome thank you for that karma I
appreciate that i'll have to look that
up Eleanor soul of the new video this
morning thank you so much Eleanor beauty
vivo hi hi jen is made from Morocco you
wanted one of my giveaways once I think
I think so but good to see you 33 or 7pm
so it's a good time for you that's
awesome Liz hialeah she wouldn't want to
give aways long time go to I wanted you
more gateways a reason why I've been
doing giveaways I know there's nobody
asked this is because I don't have time
to go to the post office and I don't
want to like do a giveaway and then feel
pressure to go to my terrible post
office and it's just like I just don't
want to deal with that right now i have
a bag of stuff that i want to give away
but i'm just going to wait till summer
then we're gonna do a ton of Giveaways
over the summer when i actually have
time to go to the post office so they're
coming but yes okay Liz says look
forward to these videos oh we thank you
so much Liz Emily says hi i want to be a
teacher of 16 years old and I'm in the
cadet teaching program down my school
would you be able to give me some advice
as an inspiring teacher I'm just my
biggest advice to you is to talk to your
teachers about what it's really like to
be a teacher and honestly I don't even
know if they're going to be able to tell
you if you didn't get a hold of a
teacher that doesn't teach you and ask
them their honest opinion about what
it's like to be a teacher and ask them
specific questions go and visit
classrooms volunteer in classrooms see
what it's really like I mean I think
that as a teenager myself but when I was
a teenager when I was in college even I
had a picture of what it was like to be
a teacher and then when I got into the
field it was so different it was so
different
you know I wish that I had been more
open to hearing the actual reality of
what it's like to be a teacher before I
became a teacher don't get me wrong I
love my kids and I love teaching my kids
and I feel like I'm pretty good at it
but it's a lot harder than I thought it
was going to be I mean how hard could it
be to teach one plus one equals two I
mean really harder than you think so I
mean really my biggest advice to you is
go volunteer in classrooms as much as
possible talk to teachers and make sure
that this is an environment you really
truly want to be in know that you are
going to be in customer service you I be
good the customer service you got to be
organized and you got to be prepared to
give up your free time because grading
papers especially in the auto Greed's
takes forever and it consumes your life
so just be prepared for that if you
enjoy grading papers if you feel like
that's something that you're going to
enjoy for long term and wonderful
excellent but just know that's part of
your life is to give up your time at
home with your friends with your family
in order to do your job off the clock so
that's the thing that I'm fighting with
right now but yes there are a lot of
wonderful things about teaching the kids
are fantastic i love the actual teaching
part it's just the other stuff that's
really trying me sometimes so
volunteering classrooms and willing
volunteer on classrooms Sheba lifts Jen
have you tried any kat von d brow
pencils lo I haven't I haven't but I
want to anything kat von d I want to try
but i have not kb 0815 can you do more
vlogs love your personality I would love
to two more vlogs and that is not going
to give focus of my channel anytime soon
but if I ever stop teaching I really
would like to resurrect my old channel
which was gentle of 37 and turned that
into a vlog channel I would love to do
that eventually but that's not going to
happen anytime soon but I do want to do
more vlogs but I really want to do more
reviews and box openings and things like
that for now there's just only so much I
can prioritize but yes that is in my
mind and I would love to do more of
lungs and thank you so much for saying
you love my personality yeah that makes
me happy esme says do you have any
recommendations for scrubs for dry skin
and
deeply moisturizing day and night creams
that are a bit cheaper you know okay my
favorite um exfoliator is the Suki
exfoliator I don't think I have any
nearly you see what you're getting at me
right I lives I don't okay they would
have been those top three tours it's
like amazing it's called su ki and it's
on yellow lemon scented amazing
exfoliator that's my favorite I don't
have super dry skin so but I've heard
good things about it doesn't dry out my
skin it makes my face feel so good after
use it it's an exfoliating cleanser it's
awesome as far as moisturizing date
night creams I love my L'Oreal collagen
booster I can only is it in the
wintertime because it's too intense for
me for the summertime but I really
really like that one a lot so those
would be my personal two recommendations
thought having dry skin I don't I can't
um recommend a ton of stuff but if you
are watching if you have recommendations
for beauty vivo to add new TV bow and
give her some suggestions for scrubs for
dry skin and deeply moisturizing day and
night creams that are a bit cheaper the
sucky is not a bit cheaper i think it's
like thirty dollars for the tub but
that's the only one that I know that I
really really like I let's see Samantha
Richmond genom in need of a good contour
brush and I'm the Real Techniques new
contour brush from the metal collection
brush suppose to be compared to a Norris
one I would imagine that one is amazing
um from recontouring I just like brushes
that are this this is the Eddie
Funkhouser brush um I like this shape
for contouring I feel like this is just
a just a perfect shape for getting in
there really really like that so I feel
like you know you're looking for a
density you're looking for it to be
relatively dense because you wanted to
pick up product nothing fluffier than
what i'm showing you here before you can
see it cuz i can't see myself but um
nothing fluffier than that um but this
angle is really nice for contouring oh I
love it Samantha if you get that brush
let me know how it goes for your
girlfriend alright Bradley actually
can't believe this new messy chaotic
eyelashes trend it looks like you've
just walked through five different forms
I know I don't know what what what is
that what is that chaotic mascara what I
got there just to reach it the reach of
first
new and I guess there's a market for
everything I just I don't get isn't that
the look we all try to avoid it is a
clumpy lashes like what I wonder if it
actually does that I know I've seen some
I think they set out some promo mascara
system people so I want to watch some
reviews i think there's already reviews
on youtube on that mascara I wonder if
you can actually not do that and from be
good mascara if you try to not get it to
clump I don't know we'll have to try it
out Riley if you do let me know home
camo facile says hi hi lol hi back to
you as May says your channel is the best
of course i've been recommending it like
non-stop to my friends thank you a lot
of them subscribed and really liked your
channels i hope you've noticed some new
subscribers thank you so much I really
really appreciate that thank you nikki
says that mascara is crazy looks like a
spider on your eyes I know it's so weird
Carly's got one what's the best editing
program you use and what do you use I
use Sony Vegas it's an older version of
Sony Vegas I've heard that um what is it
our final cut pro is much better than
sony vegas i like my sony vegas but
there's a lot of things that it does not
do so Final Cut Pro efforts better but I
don't have experience with that Lily um
I've become very good friends with she's
she got both and she likes the Final Cut
Pro better and I would imagine the
things that she's doing in her video for
editing you go to Lily Spurgeon spu RG
EO n you can see some of the editing
that she's been doing lately and kind of
see what that one does compared to what
I do it's got a lot of fancy or buttons
and things that you can do with that
software so let's see and Jen please do
you have any recommendations for
foundation for the body like sunburns
and some and spots on the hands legs and
decollete okay so you're going to need
something that's full coverage um and
then my full coverage recommendation
whenever I have recommendations what's
up lightly okay okay okay wait for me to
finish and I'll go get it with you okay
get another ball and then advising on
the street ok ok Google gutters amento
okay just be really
set up in the shapes you can cause an
accident okay won't you come a little
closer to the house okay I'll come help
you with it after I'm done I'll be done
in like 20 minutes okay all right the
Estee Lauder Double Wear is my favorite
for full coverage foundation it's
amazing um but I don't have a lot of
sunspots and stuff it makes a really
difficult for you on me to recommend
stuff but but that's definitely the one
that I always recommend from full
coverage that kind of line Lily sexing
me of course oh I think you should sound
like the mascara she said she's gonna go
get it um okay uh okay I totally lost my
train of thought okay oh the Revlon
Colorstay that one is a good solid
drugstore full coverage foundation
that's a good one hey everything's
distracting me today okay so hopefully
that helps fun all right crystal says
Northern Kentucky here curious all
L'Oreal stuff makes my eyes water oh no
the foundation slides off my face oh no
anyone else experienced this I don't
experience that but if you have talked
to Crystal be corner if you've had
issues with lore'l stuff in your eyes
water or foundation sliding off your
face hmm that sounds terrible oh my
goodness so sorry about that I haven't
had that experience but that doesn't
mean that other people haven't Emily
says if you tried recommend bhcosmetics
brushes excuse me bhcosmetics brushes or
hit and miss for me sometimes they are
very fluffy and useless and sometimes
they are awesome I've had better
experiences with their eye brushes and
their face brushes but they're okay um
the Coastal Scents one same thing some
of them are good and some of them are
not what I strongly suggest you do is
just look up some reviews look at those
pictures look for that density um I have
a coastal sense I have a kit that I
really really like it's like that was
set to me for review and it's like 50
bucks there's a lot of really good
brushes in there seen can get really
good brushes from coastal scents and bh
cosmetics it's just looking up those
reviews and looking at that density and
seeing if the shape of the brush is
something that you're you used before
something that looks interesting to you
it's really hard to tell online but for
me personally bhcosmetics brushes we've
been hit or miss
let's see okay girlie Scott one I ok I
just answered that about the editing
software so hopefully you got that
answer as an i SEZ can you please try
out make cosmetics or sold on Birchbox i
guess i have one thanks i'm a cosmetics
that I tried and this is it not even in
here anymore ok it was this thing and I
love this these were some lip products
there's a lip primer and then a silk
creme lipstick oh my goodness love love
love love love this so I would love to
try more meat cosmetics when I get some
more birchbox points all that on the
list of things to get is more meat
cosmetics so that's good to know that
you're interested in that thank you so
much for the suggestion I appreciate it
Steph cell is talking about the office
to do brushes not the essentials with
the white handle yes the black handle
ones they're cheap they're very soft the
only thing she uses I agree I agree okay
Veronica says good morning from Canada
I'm not going to butcher the knee ona
Canada California I'm not going to
butcher the name of your city glad to
finally be able to comment you are here
to my friends um let's see and then same
comment from Esme Katelyn says good
morning Jim from Boston oh my goodness
that's where my friend Cassie from
terrific is living right now she's about
to move though my cousin who lives in
Boston oh let's say another at the same
comment same comment from as night ok ok
um as me again I suggest something for
good teeth whitening at home she
struggles with that a lot I haven't been
using a lot of teeth whitening stuff
honestly like I should because I'm
starting to go a little yellow going
home oh I feel like that those click
pens are pretty good the ones that have
their have the peroxide in them I find
that I have to rinse them off my teeth
though because I get a stomach ache if I
don't but I mean they're pretty good i
mean that's that's kind of what i use is
I get the arm I've got a couple click
pens in my own subscription boxes I've
used those and I really like those I
don't know if I have any here I think
they're in my bathroom so I'm not sure
what brand i was using I tried the
whitening line
one it was actually pretty good and
speaking of lightning lightning ok let
me why my ad up on this wouldn't want
anything just for the record I want to
say I actually really like whitening
lately not weighing in Troy cosmetics
lip glosses I genuinely do and I I can't
help that I do want to put that on there
for the record I've never tried their
lipsticks and that seems to be where the
problem is but I really like their lip
glosses I like the formula I like the
pigmentation honestly I genuinely do I
hated the brow bar to go thing I thought
it was a terrible product the brow it's
like got three circles uneven know if I
have it anymore the I think I got rid of
it it's um got three circles and it's
got different bra products that was
terrible but I just didn't have the
pigmentation i needed for my brows but i
do really like lip glosses i have to
tell you that I know that's off topic
but i just wanted to save them okay
moving on let's say so hopefully that
helps as me about the about the teeth
whitening I just use those pads with
peroxide in them Laurie hi flora trying
to use a friendly editing program for
windows any suggestions we talked about
that hopefully you saw that i use a sony
vegas but i've heard that the Final Cut
Pro is better and also you can go on
Amazon and get an older version for a
lot cheaper than the newest latest
greatest version find out what the
difference is between the latest version
and an older version and seeing if you
can just get away with the older version
since we're not editing like video like
movies we don't necessarily need the
latest greatest six-hundred-dollar
version we might be able to get you know
even an older version why didn't cost
you fifty or a hundred dollars instead
of three hundred dollars so that's just
a suggestion for editing software random
Paula come Jan good morning how are you
I'm good thank you how are you what nail
polishes brands would you recommend dry
quickly dry quickly try quickly so they
all seem to dry relatively the same for
me the sally hansen insta-dry is really
good but the only thing about that one
is it crackles like after a couple of
days you'll actually see the polish
starting to shatter but that's a really
nice polish if you plan on redoing your
polish every couple of days and it does
dry pretty quickly anything else it
dries really quickly the formula x seems
to drive pretty quickly
enabling color show seems to drive
pretty quickly but those polishes are
hit or miss as far as opacity you know
what I do is I use the sesh feet as
somebody recently told me such speed is
bad for you I've never heard that before
but I use the sesh feet as a top coat
and that seems we dry it pretty quickly
i also have me sharing my drops I love
these these are the dry ice rapid nail
lacquer dryers I love this stuff it's
like Adam it's got a dropper and you
just suck up the product here and then
you trip just to drop on each of your
nails and this will seriously drive
nails so fast another thing that i found
i did a long time ago the spraying your
hand with pam this see whether that
drives you nail polish pastor it's just
messy and disgusting it works it's just
messy and discussing another thing you
can do is just turn your faucet on super
cold and run your fingernails under cold
water or have a bowl of ice water is
even better and so turn nails in it for
a minute or two dry your nail polish
super fast so that's a that's another
little tip and trick for that um let's
say okay so Nikki would that crap with
Gerard cosmetics Manning his friends
were complaining about people bullying
kathleenlights and hey I like ko but
they turn around and bully other people
that's crap okay so just back to that
real quick though honestly like I love
Karina and I love everybody that made
videos but but that wasn't bullying that
wasn't bullying in order to be bullying
you have to do what they did plus it has
to occur over time bullying's but I mean
I I'm elementary school teacher we talk
about bullying all the time and part of
the definition of bullying is that it
does have to happen multiple times it
can't just be one thing so like if the
kid came up to me and said so and so
called me ugly I would have I would say
no that's really inappropriate I'll
probably call the kid over and be like
hey you know what happened and then sort
that situation out but I would not call
that kid a bully for calling the other
kid ugly that's not bullying if the kid
is going up to him every day and calling
ugly every day that's bullying you see
the difference there's there's a big
difference so I really feel like that
we're both bully was not used
appropriately I can see where people
would think that it's bleeding but
technically it's really not um but I bet
that's where the kathleenlights things
comes in is that people are it may not
be the same person over and over again
bullying but she's constantly getting
people um bullying well not bullying but
people making negative comments but we
all get negative comments I mean
everybody gets negative comments you
know I'm YouTube that's part of putting
yourself out there I mean I don't know
Kathleen I don't know her channel I am
subscribed but I don't watch a lot of
her videos to be completely honest I
don't connect with her as well as I
would like um but I do think she has a
really good solid channel but that's
just part of having a channel is having
people say horrible things to you I mean
that's just you have to kind of thicken
up your skin a bit you know to be able
to handle this but it's part of putting
herself out there in social media
especially when you when you have
hundreds of thousands of subscribers
immunity she's inching up on a million
subscribers I mean look at look at bunny
from graveyard girl think about how much
hate that poor girl gets on a daily on a
daily job sure she gets I mean I've seen
in her comment section the horrible
things people say to her it's just part
of the media of being on YouTube is
dealing with that so you just move on
with your life you have to you have to
find a way to block it out you have to
understand that's not about who you are
you know what I'm saying um but yeah I
mean mandy was just in my opinion he was
just being a college kid as far as
maturity you know I mean that's just
what he's not anything he's a bad person
I don't I don't he was right but only
he's a bad person all right Nicki says I
left Karina she was one of the first
people I ever sub 2 for Paul she does
have a really good polish Dale I guess
that the way she describes polishes is
phenomenal like she just the way she
described the color the way she
described the opacity the way she
describes the drying the way she
describes all that it's just wonderful
what won't stop hitting on that for oh
yeah hang on the street are you
ok it's ok it's right there just stuff
I've you know what sweetheart don't
panic about 10 minutes it's ok it's all
right don't panic read nyla provide
alone people are watching this drive

long front yard I just wish you'd stay
closer to the house ah but it'll be okay
it'll be alright ok sorry guys there's
88 of you watching right now and
watching me deal with my panic and
daughter she has a lot of anxiety about
things sometimes so but anyway I was
talking about Karina and how awesome her
channel is she really does have a
fantastic polished channel if you like
nail polish it's actually really really
good um let's see as mais back Jen you
know of any vegan cosmetics aren't very
expensive other than elf a lot of the
indie brands are also other cruelty-free
in their vegan I believe that glamour
doll eyes is vegan and cruelty-free if
for I should I would definitely
recommend glamour doe eyes for eyeshadow
I don't know there are other products as
well but there I shadow is phenomenal ah
let's see anything else yeah look at
those any brands girlfriend because a
lot of those raviga and a lot of indie
brands put up some fantastic products um
let's say moving on let's say to do okay
um okay I'm looking for one that has to
with me
okay Amy says I have been than having
skin problems because not because of
makeup should i use makeup i would say
talk to your doctor talk to your
dermatologist your doctor about whether
that's okay or not i'm not an expert in
that and i don't want you to get an
infection because i told you it was ok
so i would say talk to your doctor if
you're having skin problems about using
makeup um let's see it's an ESS good
morning good morning TV Senya oh the
gold digger good morning to you natasha
sense i love you Thank You Natasha I
appreciate that crystal says all the
ugliness of that video scandal Karina
and Vanessa got a new study from me
standing up for the truth number one
funny Majora's cosmetics then complain
about Miss cool girl not being happy I
think it's probably because I haven't
watched them a schoolgirl video as far
as the drug cosmetics thing I would
imagine she didn't use the colorful
language that Karina used um I think
that's probably why they picked Karina's
is because she was so colorful but I've
been subscribed to finessin carino
forever vanessa was one of my wait wait
earlier youtube friends she's awesome
she's another really really honest Video
Creator so if you like honest reviews
create on Vanessa or great places to go
um let's see Nikki since jen i love my
illamasqua i got some from hot look to
what colors did you get I got this one
let's say this is serenity and I love
this one this one's awesome this one is
it's hard to see in this light I can't
see Oh poke poke this one is laments as
that one and this one is sÃ©ance I
believe seance and then this is the one
that I don't like this one is called
hemlock and it's because it's not opaque
it's a good top coat it's like a
greenish iridescent and I just expected
it to be opaque and it's not and that
made me sad it'd be really cool if that
was opaque i also have a couple other
LMS can nail polishes that i love but
i'll see
right now often kind of glancing up I
don't see them but I love illamasqua
nail polishes they're fab um let's see
yodeling so she post your question
before I answer it that's okay i right
um Esme says have you ever struggle with
anxiety and if you have you have any
tips about getting better no honestly I
can't say I've ever suffered from
anxiety my kid does um I try to just try
to calm her down however breathe a lot
you know I think it's just one of those
things where you just have to find an
inner peace I'm not a psychologist but
somehow find that inner peace and you
know whatever is making you anxious
figure out a way to come to peace with
who you are in that situation and
understand the world is not going to end
if something happens in that situation
you know what I'm saying like we'll deal
with it he'll deal with that and you'll
be okay but I'm not a psychologist but
and I've never gone through it
personally so I'm not an authority I
wish I could give you better advice and
I wish you luck with that because I know
that it's not easy to deal with let's
see Liz says I bought one lipstick from
Gerard and the lipstick was pretty drop
the lip gloss was great yeah i love the
lip glosses I brought i bought the
lipstick because of all the good reviews
so now i need a three think about the
lipstick mmhmm yeah I won't be buying
any lipstick from them I've heard too
much negative and they're expensive too
yaya Salazar hi Jan good morning so what
do you think about the scam that
happened to Stephanie Laurie's channel
ok I heard about that and then I never
got to watch the video because I think
that it's gone now basically my friend
Stephanie who I had not actually I can't
look all my friends ever talked for a
really long time we used to chat a lot
now that we're not friends we just
haven't talked in a long time that she
joined do a trial for network and then
they wouldn't let her out of her
contract um and she put up a video
basically saying hey everybody go tell
this company let me on my contract which
I don't know that wasn't that was a
pretty strong move to make to make a
video about that um I don't I don't mess
with networks I don't mess with them I
don't mess but I don't need a network I
everything that network could give me I
can do
my own I feel that's what I feel except
for like the cool parties that they have
like um yeah what is it um stylehaul has
really cool party sometimes so I don't
get invited to those but other than the
stylehaul parties that's the only thing
I think I'm missing out on an ass town
hall party after I'm it's like I've know
me so I'm not embroidered but I really
don't feel like I'm missing out anything
I feel like the benefit of it is
definitely not worth it um from what
I've heard I don't mess with networks
but I mean that would it's thanks man
hopefully she got out of it I hope she
got out of it she's a really nice person
I hope she got out of that contract
nikki says jan i got my vault two days
ago love it i wish i could post a pic oh
that's so exciting I'm so happy for you
I'm so jealous I nikki says she looks
like what lidar is nice i got in trade
and i love it you know i had juleps
liquid liner hey you know it's real you
know what's really really good for is
getting that fine point wing but i don't
like it on my lid so if i'm having
trouble getting that fine point where's
julep here we go i'm having trouble
getting that fine point um i use it but
it doesn't Bend as easily as i would
like um it just I don't know I I have
trouble with this one all over my eyelid
but I do like it to really define that
point so I don't recommend this one just
for that but it is a nice liner if you
can work with it it's a really nice
liner but I've tried a little bit of
trouble with the functionality of it all
right it's 1058 we're almost done for
the day amy says having problems with my
skin not makeup ok we already already
answered that question from Amy Jessica
good morning from New Jersey I've been
dying to asking us for a long time if
you could only wear one lipstick for the
rest of your life which one would it be
would you pick drugstore a high-end I
can patch it up right here you might be
surprised i usually say airy-fairy by
Rimmel but I have been loving this one
this is the Revlon just bitten kissable
balm stain in honey this is probably my
favorite lip product of all time it's
just that pinky nude it goes with
everything and I love this and you can
see I've been loving it I've had this
for a while I should probably get a new
one just because it's getting old lame
the top is cracked and this is this is
my favorite color so that would be
that's my fav and it has nothing to do
drug store high end it's just I just
really love that you know I try to shut
off the high end part of my brain when I
try products I just want to know if it's
good or not and that's a good product
let's say jessica says oh I got the part
says handsome fully all those from when
my son jon was here and was showing his
shirt yes and I said what are some of
the best primers to make my makeup last
longer face primers was I've been really
loving I love this one by the body shop
this is the vitamin C skin boost believe
it or not and smells amazing this is a
silicon based primer I love
silicon-based partners can work for some
people they don't work for others I
really really like wow this one is
amazing if you have poor issues and this
is the pore minimizing of foundation
primer by Smashbox this is the purple
one it's fab highly highly recommend
this I found to like um by is the
l'oreal revitalift miracle blur recently
I was watching my friends Sanders over
at sanders kennedy and he does not like
this product at all i forget what he
said he does to scan but he hates this
but i like it you know everyone has
their skin tight it makes a big
difference when it comes to primers a
huge difference um so yeah I mean I
think I think you just have to find
someone with your skin type and then
figure out what they like and then kind
of go along with that but yeah I mean I
think for dry skin I've heard that the
lotion type primers are much better and
for oily skin the UM the silicone
primers well so the makeup setting spray
thought for great things about the
l'oreal one the smashbox one and the kat
von d 1 i've heard good things about as
well to help your makeup last longer
alright let's see nicole says he looks
very handsome such a cutie oh and my
John is looking fine i have to talk
about my husband john office oh it's so
funny maybe my son looking he looks
sharp in his tank top ah let's see okay
it is 1101 um let's say we'll go through
just a couple more
as may says you've ever tried sarat
cosmetics no I haven't and then nicole's
is talking to Veronica and will do 23
more will do three more Mel Bella hi gem
from Australia just recently discover
your chin are already a fan keep it up
thank you so much hopefully I'll be able
to put more vidios out soon Linda the
music beauty puzzle says good morning
good morning lens I'm not love you a New
England pixie hi from Annapolis day
you're not that far from me in a process
of trying false eyelashes any tips
patience patience that's all I have to
say is patience um definitely uh you
know just take your time get some
natural ones first to try them out
because you I mean at least for me the
the long crazy ones scared me when I put
them on I just end up broken them back
off because it's just ridiculous so try
to get those natural ones and just have
patience with them when you put the glue
on make sure you let it dry a bit kind
of blow on it or wave it a little bit
until it gets a little bit tacky before
you try to stick it or else it'll just
start sliding all over the place and
it'll make a huge mess so those are kind
of my tips but I'm definitely not a fall
/ expert okay so that's that's I think
where I'm going to stop today because it
is 1102 of my daughter has been waiting
very very very patiently for me to
finish chat so that i can go chase the
tennis balls out in the yard and
instrument supposedly so i thank you so
much for hanging out with me on this
wonderful beautiful memorial day weekend

soldiers that are out overseas
protecting our country and thank you to
everyone who has served and given our
their lives for our country i mean i
guess that's kind of goes without being
said but but thank you to our military
of anyone that has military family uh
thank you so much for your sacrifices
for your spouse's service thank you so
much and yeah have a wonderful memorial
day weekend thank you for being here and
