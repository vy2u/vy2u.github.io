up and make up chat I want to ask you
guys first before we get going I've got
I bought a new microphone for chat and
possibly other ventures so I went I want
to check and see and make sure that this
sounds okay I tested it on headphones it
sounded good but if for some reason I'm
like blasting you out or if it sounds
weird let me know and I will change it
but I didn't want to let you know that
that is a difference in what I'm doing
right now so uh yeah uh huh so let's go
ahead and start talking about makeup oh
my goodness lots of stuff going on in
makeup woohoo oh you know what let's
just go ahead and jump into the the
comments I'm noticing there's already a
bunch of comments okay I actually
pre-read Valerie's comments as I was
setting up Valerie is 14 you said I
thanked 14 years old and she she she
wants to know about why people pluck
their eyebrows all the way off and
honestly let me tell you girlfriend this
is something that you will learn about
all people is that all people have
different ideas of what is beautiful on
them um people you know they try
different things people experiment so I
don't think that I don't know I mean I
guess it's just kind of a personal
preference thing as far as why people
would pluck all their eyebrows off um I
know my aunt has done that for years and
I think that was maybe because she you
know didn't really know how to shape
them so it was just easier to just pluck
them all off and back when she was
younger you didn't necessarily have
somebody that you could go and get your
eyebrows done you probably didn't
because you know she's in her early 60s
now so that was probably why she did it
I mean why do people dye their hair gray
why do people do anything that they do
it's just you know somebody they have an
idea and they go for it you know what
I'm saying you know your mom she says
her mom told her that she would
understand when she was older I think
that sometimes like no you know as a mom
myself I know sometimes let me just say
this i will say you'll understand when
you're older
I'm not really sure of the answer so
that might be what was happening with
your mom cuz I don't think that it's
necessarily like a private thing I think
it's just you know everyone has a
different opinions unless your mom knows
something that I don't which is totally
possible um but but yeah I just one of
those things you know people people
think different things are beautiful on
their face and they just make different
choices I hope that answers your
question Kiki hello good morning thank
you to Kiki she and contributed a lot to
this week's what's up in makeup thank
you so much girlfriend and hello and
good morning Caroline thank you so much
for speaking with Valerie about uh about
her concerns about people plucking their
eyebrows and i agree with you Caroline
Valerie sounds like an awesome awesome
young lady all right Nicky good morning
Nicki she says I love your lipstick what
color brand is it let me see if I can
find it I know it's a Revlon long
sitting here it is it's just this
girlfriend this is the Revlon just
bitten kissable balm stain in cherish
and that was what I was wearing in the
what's been makeup video and I will
swatch any it's just a blue tone pink
which I don't normally wear but in the
summer time I've been self tanning and I
felt like it looked pretty good and I
was wearing that um the Flamingo shirt
so I was trying to kind of try to match
and all that um yeah so so that's where
that came from so that's what that was
SE polish looked like they copied OPI
color paints I know right the OPI and
also formula X has won a version and I
couldn't remember I don't know where you
were yesterday when I needed you I could
remember the other brand that had
something like that a new formula X had
one and I thought it was ciate but it
wasn't you're right it was OPI I think
that's just one of those things where
people copy you know different companies
go on the same trend like I just hit the
microphone hopefully I didn't hurt
anything um like the like those sugar
like the rough texture everybody jumped
on the rough texture thing for a while
it was the this yacht a look caviar
pearls were really popular the metallic
nail polishes I think that seems like
one company starts with a concept and
then they other companies do the same
thing and who's to say the first one
that comes out with it
is the one that started it I mean maybe
there's like a little whisper in the
nail polish industry that tells other
nail polish industries what's coming up
I don't know but it does seem like a lot
of companies come out with the same
concept at the same time so we'll see I
don't know also came out with such a
horrible description of that product
I've been curious to know whether it is
similar to the OPI color paints on if
you didn't see the episode it's like it
says watercolor and it just looks like
watercolor on the nails the way that
they the way they blend together there's
a blue a pink and a yellow and a white
that kind of plans together and the
color paints is similar but it's a
silver base and the the formula x 1 is a
silver base as well also pretty
impressing the elf products to oh my
goodness girlfriend like I'm not ready
to recommend yet but then but if I were
to recommend anything at this point the
natural eye palette was phenomenal like
like phenomenal like I'm not even
kidding like for drop for ten dollars
like I i would think that it's just as
good as the l'oreal appellate new one
that I got and I might even like it
better I don't know it's it's really
good and honestly like it was really
easy to work with it was even easier to
work with than the L'Oreal appellate one
which was my favorite of the drugstore
pouts when I did the six drugstore
palette comparison the elf palette was
is really really easy to work with I
still don't think it's quite as creamy
and buttery as a high-end shadow but it
blended just as easily so does that
creamy and buttery pneus matter I don't
know if it were if it performs just as
well I don't know I guess that's going
to be up to personal preference but man
that palettes awesome oh my goodness
alright Lorraine good morning dear he
says good afternoon I hope you are
having a good weekend sure you and the
kids are excited about school finishing
up for the summer yes we just finished
up on Friday actually I could have
finished up on Thursday but it wasn't
done packing up my room I'm switching
classroom so I'd to pack up my whole
classroom so that took a little bit
longer so I was there on friday as well
so very excited about that very excited
to be producing some new content for you
and and keeping up on that i am so
behind on everything i have a new beauty
test tube from the last two months that
I never shot I already filmed the next
video that's going to go up is three
beauty box 5s I
already have a deal with them for three
every three months but i also have a one
that I shot when I shot what's up in
makeup three boxy charm reviews so I'm
really excited to share those with you I
also have what did I film I filmed the
jcat beauty haul not haul but the review
of all the jcat beauty products that I
got which is a pretty a reasonably
priced brand I already filmed that and I
think that's all I have stacked up but
man I have so much content that i want
to make for you that I've just been
waiting to be able to to film so and and
to edit and get up for you so I'm really
excited about increasing the content on
the channel because it's definitely been
lacking lately and and it really comes
down to that I have a commitment to the
children that I teach and their parents
to put them as my number one priority
and I don't think it would be fair to
put a makeup channel over someone's
education I think that would be just
messed up so I appreciate your patience
but you know I had to you know go with
teaching first as a number one priority
and unfortunately that made it so that I
couldn't produce as many videos but now
that school is over let's move on to the
future there's going to be a lot more
content coming up Nikki's talking about
the formula X nail kit with the
watercolor thing as well yep you're
right Nikki and then she's talking about
cielo having a huge blowout sale tons of
items for fifty to seventy percent off
thank you so much nikki i missed that
yesenia Thank You Yesenia for all your
help this week I really appreciate it
she says she's excited about the
colour-pop liquid lipsticks I have a
feeling they're going to be fab I mean
there's the swatches look amazing my
only concern would be if they're drawing
that would be my big wonder is are they
drawing how long do they last and do
they have a staining effect that would
be my big questions about those products
looking at color pop I have a feeling
they are going to have that staining
effect and I have a feeling they're
gonna have a long where time but I'm
concerned about not concerned but the
big question in my mind is the drawing
are they drawing and we will see we will
see when there's more reviews out Nicki
Morris hello Nicki I gotta stay I gotta
go I can't stay but just wanted to say
Charlotte Tilbury is giving away 50
limited edition boxes away whoo let's go

three months summertime now I got now I

you so much for checking in Valerie says
gentle be my first time watching live so
I'm so excited why can't kathleenlights
or Danny from coffee break uh a coffee
break with me whoo or via bubzbeauty do
live chat I don't know with that that's
up to them and their channels i I don't
know i i'm not friends with any of them
I don't know them so I can't say why
they don't you know I mean I just I I
guess I just kind of do I find out
something exists and it doesn't really
matter to me whether other people are
doing it or not I just do what I want to
do and I guess that's why this exists
it's because I don't really look at what
other people do and then do what they do
like hence what's up in makeup you know
I just I don't know I get ideas and I go
with it so hopefully more people will do
live chats I know that um my new friend
oh my gosh you leave her name right this
second oh my goodness she's oh she's so
beautiful and camera what her name is
right now oh my gosh that's terrible
okay I have to find out I have to look
in my subscriptions hold on a second
camera board her name is oh my gosh it's
like on the tip of my tongue juvies ever
happen to you wick on the tip of your
tongue like you cannot remember
somebody's name like you could picture
her face and I can't even remember what
her name is but I can find out in about
10 seconds
um Holly eats lipstick Holly started
doing some live live chats with her
subscribers so I was excited to see that
and then hopefully they'll be some more
and I know Jessica from jmud 89 did one
at one point so hopefully she'll be
doing more as well let's see okay hold
on a minute okay make up new hello good
morning she does a YouTube question
posted this in the app but no matter how
I upload a custom thumbnail always shows
up upside down oh no how does that
happen that's terrible by the way to you
I have your perp you're perfectly posh
video open and I've watched about seven
minutes of it and I keep getting
distracted cuz like the kids will walk
in or whenever and I'm in the middle of
watching your video I still have it open
though just so you know I haven't
forgotten about you Jenna right I
believe it's Jenna uh I don't know I
would check on go to have you tried
using picmonkey that's what i use it can
be free like you can check this in
picmonkey for free picmonkey.com is how
i edit all my videos i do do the monthly
subscription i forget how much it is a
month it's like five bucks or seven
bucks or something a month to use all
the bonus features but if you go to pick
monkey and you insert your picture you
should be able to check and see like the
sizing of it and everything and see
whether it's upside down check that and
see what's happening there and um yeah
that you shouldn't be having that
problem that's very very weird something
must be happening with your file I don't
know but go to pick monkey and try that
and hopefully that helps it's very weird
I don't know I've never had that problem
that's so weird alright hopefully that
helps Jetta Sandra loves makeup good
morning every Beauty good morning to you
beautiful miss Sandra good morning all
right make up new back to gym Jenna I'm
super excited about the liquid lipsticks
as well going to place an order next
week for the metamorphoses quad and trap
doughnut and first base I guess there's
a different I shadows i believe so
that's interesting very cool i think i'm
gonna hold off on the color pop for a
bit I don't know see how kind of
get the liquid lipsticks but it's like
everybody in the grandmothers gonna be
reviewing them so maybe I'll wait a
little while till there's more color pop
stuff that I want I think I'm going to
skip the metamorphosis palettes mm just
doesn't interest me it's just a personal
thing nothing against you know any of it
but it just doesn't interest me
something I'm gonna skip that so I think
I'll wait to get some liquid lipsticks
until they get come out with something
else that they like calls my name let's
see Nikki I did a super skinny eyebrows
for a few years in my 20s and OMG it was
awful good to know Nikki I never did
superseding I need my eyebrows done so
bad I just haven't had time I haven't
had time but they're not going super
skinny that will bother me Emily good
morning what are some good cheap
eyeshadow primers the elf one doesn't
work for me you know I'm not a big fan
of the elf one either I'm not I I it's
okay it's fine but it's you know it's
not my favorite have you tried the
Milani one the Milani one is pretty good
I really like that one also the one by
Coastal Scents is really good believe it
or not if you have any ordering from
coastal scents or you know you're you
know want to go there to coastal scents
I think it's kind of expensive though if
i remember right now i want to say it's
like eight bucks or something crazy but
it's really really really good I am
gonna be doing a full on coastal scents
review keep hitting this microphone
thing I'm going to do a full-on Coastal
Scents review at some point I have a ton
of products from coastal scents that are
not eyeshadows that I want to share with
you I just haven't gotten to it yet but
that's something that I definitely want
to do and one of my raves is the
eyeshadow primer but as far as drug
store I mean really just the Milani one
and the Coastal Scents one there's the
only ones that I know about our amazing
so if you um if you have any suggestions
for Emily just you at Emily EMI ly
traditional spelling of it which sheep
eyeshadow primers other than the elf one
if you could talk to her that would be
wonderful alright the violet December
good morning dear have you tried makeup
geek thinking about ordering and would
love to hear her thoughts yes you know I
tried a bunch of makeup geek shadows
when they first came out it was super
excited Marlena is actually one of the
inspirations for my channel I used to
watch Marlena back when I had my old
channel gentle of 37 and she was the
only person that I ever
doing makeup videos back then she was
only one that I knew that did it so um
so yeah so that was one of the reasons
why she was one of the reasons why I
started a beauty channel was like a she
can do it I can do it so when she came
out with the eyeshadows I tried them and
I honestly I really really liked them a
lot I haven't tried any of the foiled
shadows or any of the new stuff but
everything I've tried as far as makeup
geek eyeshadows I've really enjoyed so
if you like what you've seen and in
videos and things i would say that from
what my experience it's legit and i
really really like them and that's you
know without any bias or anything we
have Merlin and I met at imats last year
but other than that we have absolutely
no connection and we talked for about
two minutes and you know you know it was
one of those things where I walked up to
her and like hey my name is Jan I
channel called gentles reviews ok it's
nice to meet you and we took a picture
it was like one of those things it
wasn't like a hey I know you like it
wasn't like that so it's been anyway yes
on makeup geek I really really enjoy
enjoy her eye shadows Cathy says hi Jan
your makeup look beautiful what's up in
makeup went to malli weekend at QVC ooh
that's so I didn't know that existed
malli malli weekend at QVC what what is
that that sounds cool I've heard that
there's QVC and HSN warehouses places is
it a place like that we can go to like a
QVC location and like shop and stuff
that'd be so cool I think that's what
you're talking about but that sounds
like so much fun and thank you very much
for compliments on my makeup I
appreciate it a lot yesenia good morning
good morning to you yesenia and thank
you for your contributions this week I
really really appreciate it Sarah good
morning from Kansas City Mike sounds
good oh good oh I'm so glad other
ventures please explain please um should
I tell you what my other ventures I it's
not like a hundred percent I'm still
trying to figure it out so it's
definitely like at like forty percent
right now as far as it actually
happening so don't like freak out get so
excited um Lily scope she doesn't mind
me saying this Lily Spurgeon who is one
of my very good friends on YouTube we
were thinking about doing a podcast
um what's up in makeup podcast where we
would pick a topic for the week and talk
about the new releases and then talk
about a topic and one thing we really
thought about that would be good is that
she is of a medium skin tone and I
amiable light skin tone we have
different skin types we have different
hair types so that would be I think
really good to kind of join together to
create a podcast for information for
makeup because we realized that there
really aren't any good makeup podcasts
and we just bounce off of each other
really well we get along really well I
think it would be really fun to do a
podcast so that's one of the reasons why
I got a microphone um so yeah so that's
a possibility but again it's only like
40 percent possible right now in my
opinion we're still working out a lot of
details I don't know if Lily's really
one hundred percent like I don't know I
think it was her idea but then now like
I'm not sure if she now that we're
saying about actually doing it like I
don't know well if it left it we'll see
what happens we'll see what happens but
that's a possibility that's all uh John
said he'll do a podcast with me that
would be fun if john and i did a makeup
podcast together how funny would that be
what we could just talk about anything
baby right let me talk about all kinds
stuff we could talk about fitness but
what would I don't even know we're like
having this off topic conversation but
what would our like theme even be like
Kenneth's we could just talk about cats
cats of YouTube I don't like that I'm
not a big fan of that idea um but like
we have to have some kind of like
overarching like okay Johnston it wants
your opinion on if John and I did a
podcast together what would be our like
overarching theme I don't know I don't
know that's kind of weird we'll see but
anyway I don't know but I would love to
do a podcast I think that would be
really fun but I also don't want to do
too many things and then not be able to
keep up with them because then you know
just launch the app and then I've got
the channel with the what's up and make
up and increasing the videos and
everything I'm not trying to go
overboard with it but a podcast there's
no editing you know you just commit to a
specific time and you just do it for
that our whenever like it's not as much
commitment I don't think
is YouTube channel so no no we'll see so
that that's kind of the idea Sarah since
you asked all right moving on to the
next question nikki says it's like
glitter puked on your eyes what what are
you talking about glitter puked on your
eyes what is this whose eyes who's Isaac
glitter puke on I don't know I don't
know what you're talking about Nikki you
maybe you're having like a conversation
with somebody else and I missed it
alright Mackenzie hey loving this as
part of my Sunday routine i'm so glad
thank you for being such an honest
person so refreshing thank you so much I
try it makes me sad that that's
refreshing that should be pretty uh
standard honesty I don't know that's my
opinion but doesn't always happen all
right Nikki says Jen nice love the lip
color good i'm so glad good and it's
it's drugstore and it's nice it's a nice
moisturizing lip product i really really
like that one if you're just joining us
i was saying that my lip product that i
wore in what's up and make up this week
was the the Revlon just bitten kissable
balm stain in cherish was what I was
wearing and got some compliments on that
so all right Sarah's like Jen podcast
yes that is a possibility possibility I
Cathy says good morning what's up and
makeup friends good morning to you Kathy
Emily says thanks leanness we'll look
into it I'm not sure what's going on
with that I miss that conversation
because I skipped down um let's see
Nikki a podcast would be amazing I will
say we'll see what happens i would
really like to thank you for your
feedback Nikki Marlene says good morning
Jen happy Father's Day to John happy
Father's Day from Marlene manque you I'm
not sure if you can hear with the new
microphone i don't know if you guys
could hear him but he says thank you
shannon says jenga morning hope your
life is getting a little less hectic it
is uh-uh so much better so much better
what is your favorite blush specific one
or a particular brand unfortunately my
very very very very very favorite blush
has been discontinued and I'm mad at Kat
Von D for doing that because it's my
fave where is it where do they go
this is the right one is the other one
ok I'll show you the one that still
exists this is bellisima by Kat Von D
kat von d blushes are my favorite
formula I absolutely love this is this
one's still around this is like a coral
II kind of color I really loves to love
the bombs blushes their formula is
amazing any cheek products by the ball
more fabulous you've got to be aware of
clown face be careful of that because
that can get a little prize today as far
as cream blushes my favorite are the
Make Up For Ever HD cream blushes
they're fab of course blushes are very
nice I've been playing lately a lot with
this the floral palette thingy I've been
playing with this empowering shade and I
really really like that one a lot so
those are kind of my favorites but my
favorite of all time that I didn't even
say what it was was Essex by Kat Von D
it's like I'm all be kind of color and I
don't know where it is but it's
discontinued so but anyway Kat Von D
blushes are fab and then follow very
very closely by the bomb I'm a faves
leann happy summer break Jen thank you
so much happy Father's Day to John from
Leanne Gina good morning from Tennessee
good morning to you Gina zany Lanie good
morning finally made it here alive I'm
so happy you are here Lena yeah it makes
me so happy Marlene is talking about the
eyebrow chat I find out as I age my skin
sags lower thinning my brows out some
have even given me a more youthful look
huh my space between the brows and the
lids interesting you learn something new
every day thanks Marlene thanks Marlene
Nikki sang test it's working nikki nikki
says I'm dying over this for the
Charlotte Tilbury sculpt and highlight
for it so many good things but it's
expensive I know that stuff is just so
crazy and you wonder whether it's worth
that price I mean is is a powder like is
a blush or highlight truly worth that
price you know really and truly because
you know like I've got my hourglass that
I love like this one but it is truly
worth $65 or whatever I pay for it you
know I could I could do like to fan
meals for this price of antsy but you
know I mean like it's like do I really
need this well I don't need it do I love
it yeah love it I don't need it so I
mean it's really your your level of
addiction and whether you feel like
spending that much is worth it i don't
know i think it's different for every
person really and truly but yeah there
charlotte tilbury products look amazing
they really do I've never tried any of
them but they look amazing Andy kitty

lipsticks yes I am I hope you try them
out I'm thinking about it I am
considering i am thinking about i think
i'm gonna wait a little while i don't
think i'm gonna be part of that initial
everybody jump on it and review it thing
but because i still have some color pop
stuff that i haven't filmed yet so um
you know it's just bad timing but i do
want to get some eventually maybe when
they come out with like the next product
whatever that is maybe i'll jump on and
get some liquid lipsticks with it says
they aren't available in the UK but you
can get them on ebay oh that's cool and
get them shipped to the UK
really that's interesting that's good to
know Perry good to know all right zany
Lainey I also love to use kanava for
picture editing I don't know that CA
okay canva kanaba I had an extra
syllable in there can but for picture
editing that's good to know Laney thank
you so much er I want to get them so bad
I want them all I can't wait probably
the liquid lipsticks from colour-pop all
right Nikki uh says the Danny quad is
awful Oh Julie oh I didn't hear it was
awful I heard it was good I don't know
but that's sad that it's awful I don't
want it to be awful that said that's
terrible though I oh well maybe I don't
know I guess it's me is it one of those
personal preference things or why is it
awful I want to know why it's awful i
was playing on not getting it anyway but
why is it awful all right um jenna is
talking to Laney Kiara ok it looks like
we're Calvin what's your favorite lip
liquid lipstick oh the next one's the
NYX soft matte lip creams are amazing i
love those followed by the the Rimmel
show-off lip Velvets the only reason why
these are well non reason I feel like
these are less drawing than these and
also these there's more shades that I
like in the knicks then in the Rimmel
but they're both nice but if I had to
recommend any I would say be Nick's I
really like those a lot but I haven't
tried a lot of the high-end ones like
the see loved ones and things like that
i haven't tried so i can't speak to
those those are pretty much the only
ones that i have that i know of as far
as liquid lipsticks let me make sure
there's nothing else on my drawer that
i'm missing for liquid lipsticks yeah i
haven't tried on a whole lot of liquid
lipsticks I've tried the the mirror nest
ones they're really really pigmented and
messy so I'm not not as big a fan than
me and asked one just because they're so
messy but I think that's all I have for
liquid lipsticks oh I don't know if you
count glosses from whitening lightning /
Gerard cosmetics he's not really liquid
lipsticks but I would definitely put the
next over these as far as the liquid
lipstick eNOS you
more glosses then liquid lipsticks I
think that's all I tried I haven't tried
a whole lot of liquid lipsticks to be
honest with you but if I have to pick up
the ones that tried I would say the
knicks long answer short no I don't know
what just happened there alright moving
on a sandra not crazy about liquid
lipstick am i missing something it's
just a trend girlfriend they're
difficult to apply and feel awful on the
lips they definitely can I don't get the
interest with these I think it's just
because it's something new you know and
it's just you know it's trending and
it'll go away eventually same thing with
contouring I feel like that's gonna fade
a bit I think people are still going to
contour but I don't think it's going to
be as big as it is now I give it like a
year for the trend and then something
else will be popular all right la winter
is have you tried the Smith &amp;amp; cult nail
polish no but I really want you they
sell it on the birchbox shop and I keep
putting it in my cart and then taking it
out and putting in my cart and taking it
out but are they good have you tried
them if you've tried them and they're
good maybe i will definitely get one
maybe i will definitely does that make
sense I I would like to get one if you
say that they're good i will definitely
get one yes I will at least one they're
expensive they're like twenty bucks
apiece any kitty 1gen essence makes good
eye shadow primer for cheap that's good
to know she says less than five dollars
I've never tried the essence 1 I know
that I don't like the hard candy one I
don't like that one at all just as an
opinion for i shadow primer okay d says
hi from Sydney Australia oh my goodness
you should come visit a girlfriend I
would love to I would love to I would I
wish it wasn't halfway across the world
I would be amazing because I used to
have a friend that lived in Australia
and he should take videos all the time
of Australia and it just I've heard
wonderful things about your country and
I would love to go there one day one day
one day I would love to Steph zilla hey
let's see they have QVC outlets and
stuff ok not sure if they carry a lot of
beauty products though my boss goes
there all the time i heard that they do
carry quite a bit i remember i used to
go to the chiropractor it's a long story
i'm not going to go in my chiropractor
story but I you should go to the
chiropractor and his wife used to go to
those and she said tell me about a multi
she said she used to go see a lot of
make up there all right let's see
everybody's talking about the
possibility of a podcast we'll see what
happens I don't know we're so we're
still thinking about it we'll see oh um
yeah I don't know we'll see it's just an
idea right now all right Fleck Leanne
how are you good morning Jen and friends
new coupon for cover FX website joy

money on our website will give you a
little discount but that's our gift to
you you know like I don't like those
sales I'm all down that Giorgio Armani
stable did you guys see that Giorgio
Armani is like what is it twenty percent
off the entire website now that is a
sale you know spend $75 and give you ten
percent like that just I don't know that

really really i don't know but i guess

good chance you're gonna spend $75 I
guess doesn't only mad at that much
let's see thank you so much for that LAN
Emily says Jet best high-end mascara
honestly there are a lot of really good
drugstore mascaras but if you're telling
me high-end I'm going to go with Urban
Decay perversion I really really like
this one a lot this is kind of my
current high and favorite let's see any
other high-end favorites i can think
about right now hmm imeem really that's
the only one that's coming to mind right
now that i know that i absolutely love
the roller lash i have i don't love this
just because it never quite 100% sets
and it feels very heavy to me even
though it is a good formula i don't like
the way it feels so i guess it should
meet being picky um let's see also i've
been trying the Clinique one wears a
clinic one this one's really good this
is the clingy tile impact mascara I've
been really enjoying this i think i like
the Urban Decay perversion just a little
bit better but I do really like this one
a lot I think mascara is one of those
things that's very personal because
everyone's eyelashes are different you
know we have different lengths
we have different you know you know
thickness of our lashes of our natural
lashes we have different you know
sparseness of our lashes so I think
different mascaras really truly perform
differently on different people but
those are the ones that work best for me
personally I have um you know pretty
short you know just just you know kind
of I don't know they're just like I
don't know their their normal ordinary
kind of short lashes they're not amazing
i always want to have really nice lashes
but i just don't have them Emily good
morning happy to catch the chat today
would love a podcast from you and Lily I
think that would be fun I really do so
we'll see we'll see what happens lots of
yeses on the podcast i'll have to let
Lily know she's probably sleeping under
she was up late last night all right
Leanne got the new Urban Decay palette
and loved it good to know tried to cover
FX drops and they worked great I did try
the cover FX drops but I got the little
sample from Sephora and it's just not
working the way it's supposed to just
because I feel like I'm not doing it
right because it doesn't have the
dropper so how do I know how many drops
i'm using if I'm just kind of splashing
it into my foundation so I found my
shade I'm debating about whether I want
to actually purchase them or not we'll
say I'm not really sure I I didn't find
that they didn't set like Lily was
saying that they didn't set on her like
she'd have felt like that her foundation
didn't set with the cover FX drops but I
don't know it worked ok for me so i
don't know i'm i'm back and forth about
whether i want to buy those let's see
got the chief face new foundation and
love palette but i haven't tried them
out yet i have the new to face
foundation speaking of that I got the
the ones in my Ipsy where are they oh
they're right here they had them for FC
points so i got vanilla and light beige
and i mix these together to make my skin
tone now i use it for the first time
yesterday and let me tell you my
experience from using this one time was
that I had immediate creasing underneath
my eyes like it was almost immediate to
the point where I had to go like this
and blends under my eyes in order to get
the creasing to go away and then a
couple hours later I looked in the
mirror and it was creasing again like
what is going on I didn't notice it in
my forehead wrinkles but I sure notice
it under my eyes I didn't wear any
concealer that day
I so I know it was the foundation that
was creasing it was really weird because
i don't typically have a problem with
creasing under my eyes so really really
really weird i didn't change anything
else but the use of the foundation so oh
no um also just to give you a heads up
when i do do the review of this if see
that was giant Ipsy bag that i got like
huge Ipsy bag because i got a bunch of
extra stuff with FC points just so you
know i will be giving away one of these
in the next epsy review this one is in
sand this one's for lily and then this
one here is the one in caramel this one
is going to be forgiven a so if you were
of the skin tone i am going to be giving
this away so this one's the darkest 1
i'm not going to open it and pump it
because i'm not trying to you'll
compromise the product but i will be
giving this away along with a couple of
other things in the next if see on
bagging so keep an eye out for that but
yeah so so far i mean and also the other
thing i want to say about these is that
i really felt like it looked like I had
foundation on I don't feel like it gave
me a natural look at all I i went out i
saw a friend from work um did she came
over to my house very quickly to pick
something up and she was looking at my
face maybe it was because it was a
Saturday and you know there's no reason
for me to have had makeup on at that
point especially as much makeup as I had
on but she was giving me this look like
like I had a lot of makeup on and I felt
like I had a lot of makeup on um but I
was wearing it in the the what's up in
makeup video but it's hard to tell like
you know on video versus in person but I
definitely don't feel like this gave me
a natural look at all I felt like it was
more medium to full coverage like more
flawless rather than natural if that
makes sense so I don't know I'm gonna
have to play with it more I've only used
at the one time i use the yesterday and
that's it so i'll play with it more and
then we'll do full review later I don't
know if it's going to be in its own
separate video or if I'm going to throw
it in with other things but I will
definitely be reviewing those on the
channel let's see so now that we've done
with LeAnn and our comments back and
forth about these different products
let's move on to Nikki anyone take
advantage of the max sale ten dollars
off every every fifty dollars I might
take the plunge I have high end button
but I feel Makka soap
and I don't want it I'm weird I'm the
same way Nicky as far as Mac I don't get
a lot of Mac because everybody has mac
so why buy mac and also like I got the
Cinderella palette I finally jumped in
and got some and I was really not
impressed with that Cinderella palette
from for it being Mac like oh my
goodness it smack it was like you know
it was it was fine it was good it was
alright but it wasn't like oh my
goodness this is amazing you have to go
out and get it you know what I'm saying
very weird so I don't know I like the
lipsticks that I owned by them but I
don't know I just don't feel the need to
buy a ton of mac i'm totally with you
totally with you maybe just because I
own so many things from so many other
brands I don't know I would like to own
a mac palette though at some point just
for comparison purposes because like i
see like laura from mrs. Lowell in she's
got those huge mac pouts and she'll be
she's always saying you know she'll get
a lil ROK palette and she'll say oh and
this lorac shade is a dupe for max
whatever like I wish I could do that
that'd be awesome but you know is that
lame that I only want to get Mac
products to dupe other products so that
i can say it's do because i know other
people like mac i'm weird with you Nikki
we can be weird together Lee Ott's hello
again from Israel hello to Israel oh my
goodness hello hello Shannon says hey
would love a podcast with you and John I
think would be awesome cool uh yeah I
think it would be fun to immediately
can't you know if lily and I do it and
then John can like guest spot sometimes
that'd be cool Lauren Australia
represent yes that's so awesome leanness
talking to Nikki does it out of that
yeah oh no I lost my spot I hate it when
that happens hold on i'm kind of hold on
a minute I lost my spot okay okay I'm
finding it again I'm almost there almost
there i'll show you represent there it
is okay sometimes the the chat window
like I get so backed up that I can't
like I start scrolling down and then
just skipped right to the bottom okay
let's see uh LeeAnn flaca says Nikki
only thing I used for mac is a prep and
the fix plus spread
I not a mag fan I think it's overhyped I
don't have the fix plus I've thought
about getting it and I went to the fore
and I got the Smashbox one instead but I
thought about getting it so many times I
do like the another product that I like
from Mac is the where is it the
mineralized skin finish this is just the
one in medium the press powder i really
like it a lot i do i think it's a
fabulous pressed powder so there's one
thing that i like from mac that I can
definitely vouch for let's see Heather
good morning love watching your videos
thank you so much you're so awesome
formative thank you so much I really
appreciate that thank you thank you any
kitty one um I wish you say she thinks
Danny quad is like glitter puke I don't
know I don't know man i haven't tried it
I cannot speak cannot speak Emily says
best high-end mascara I just went over
that a minute ago was that you Emily
that acid before I completely forget who
asked the question and I don't want to
scroll back but what I was saying was
the Clinique these are the ones i've
been loving lately the clinic high
impact mascara and the Urban Decay
perversion those are my favorites right
now for high-end mascara let's see Jen
you have tattoos yes and what are they
did your hubs do them and it says let's
see John is totally metrosexual tattoo
artists and you are youtuber could you
do a podcast on modern marriage then be
interesting that'd be very interesting
oh my goodness so funny and it's funny
because like I don't know I'm not gonna
go there but anyway yes I have tattoos I
am working on a back piece that's a
bunch of different pieces all together
and basically it's my favorite like
fairy tales and movies from being a
child and it's taking over my whole back
but I haven't got it worked on in like
four years so everything's kind of
fading so for like I'll tell you a
little bit like I have right here i have
the owl from the movie labyrinth here i
have Falkor from the neverending story
on my shoulder with Bastian on the back
on Rue I have a little guy on my hip
that's from a cartoon called the sea
prints
fire child it's an anime cartoon that
used to watch when I was little so I
have that here I have alice in
wonderland with the the traditional
picture hi baby it's just a traditional
picture that's in the original Alice in
Wonderland book it's Alice with the
curtain and she's opening the curtain to
reveal the little door where she you
know she drinks and eats she you know
drink me and eat me all those like
things wherever and then she goes to the
little door when also i have i have a
giant mermaid up my side it's just like
a regular generic mermaid sitting on a
rock but everything needs like love so i
don't want to put it in a video because
if you know everything's four years old
or whatever and it's not super bright
it's not like especially my Falkor my
file kors like 10 years old so he needs
a little bit of love to like spruce him
up but yes John did all of those tattoos
oh except for the one that I have it's a
theater masks that I got before I met
John it's like a white mask with
feathers and that's got a whole bunch of
significant meaning or whatever its kind
of over by the Alice in Wonderland's
with the with the curtain it's hard to
describe but I have less attached to
said and then I have the wedding couple
that was on my wedding invitation on my
ankle that yeah so but anyway John did
all of them except for the theater masks
so yeah uh so funny that John is totally
metrosexual he really can be and then
sometimes he's just a dude like
sometimes he wears makeup and sometimes
he's just you know most of the time he
doesn't most of the time he just you
know she's a regular dude you know I
don't know he think that you know when
he's on camera you only get like a very
small fraction of who he is as a person
i think the UM the birchbox Smackdown
videos is where you really get to see
him and who he is um but he's such a
complex person and he's constantly like
in a state of flux of things he's
interested in so he's an interesting guy
I really liked him a lot i think i'm
gonna keep him but yeah that's an
interesting idea for the podcast on
modern marriage yeah definitely
alexandra hello happy Father's Day to
John thank you so much happy father's
day what she said ha happy father day
happy fathers
everyone out there happy Father's Day to
the mothers who are also Father's happy
Father's Day to the fathers of Harry
children and wings children and crawling
children you know animal children happy
Father's Day to those fathers as well
let's see um Fleck is talking about oh
okay Oh Leon says she likes the good
coffee break with Danny quad from
colour-pop yeah I mean it looks nice and
the swatches so Oh Nicole's here good
morning tell john happy father day happy
Father's Day to your husband to Nicole
let's say did I lose it again please
don't tell me I lost it again oh my
goodness so frustrating what is going on
here I hate when I accidentally skipped
down oh that's maybe I went up come on
oh I'm sorry sorry I'm trying to avoid
rude okay I'm getting there got
Australia represents let's say okay I
found it all right Emily there's this
new app bit mochi and you create an
avatar and it has a lot of cute and
funny pictures with your avatar and it's
free and it's really cute and fun okay
good to know Emily thank you jen not you
oh well the danny quad is awful it's
like glitter puke on your eyes oh gosh
okay yeah I know I know you didn't mean
me sweetheart I know that okay but
that's good to know I wasn't planning on
getting it but you know I think it
sounds like it's gonna be a personal
preference thing because I'm hearing
some good things as well so yeah I don't
really like a lot of glitter on my eyes
so that's good to know to know that it's
definitely not for me amanda says good
morning would love a podcast to watch I
love your channel just getting really
into makeup and loving ulta and it's
spending a lot of money visits afford
for the first time on thursday yeah it
can get very very expensive very very
very quickly and for those of you just
joining us the podcast thing is like not
a hundred percent it's like forty
percent like it's just an idea i'm
playing around with with Lily Spurgeon
and possibly my husband so it's just
something i'm throwing around
let's see Lee Anne says I saw a a few
the bomb products sold on walmart i know
i got an email was it i think that was
from you LeAnn about the bomb products
buy it already filmed so I couldn't
include it but I looked on walmart.com
and I couldn't find it says they got
only 10 they have only ten things but
they but they have blushes for like
fifteen dollars so that's good to know I
looked very quickly on my phone and
couldn't find them but i'll have to look
again on my computer and see if i can
find them but yeah I couldn't include it
cuz I'd already filmed i filmed
typically on either friday nights or
saturday mornings well he's got one hey
everyone hey I wanted to I want to try
stitch fix has anyone else tried it and
is it worth it christine and i'm not
sure what her channel name is Christine
my friend Christine does a stitch fix
she's got some numbers and so I always I
can never remember the numbers after but
I've watched her stitch fix unboxings
and she seems to have really good
communication with the person that's her
stylist and you know it seems to be hit
or miss for her I haven't tried stitch
fix so if you have any suggestions for
girlies got one on stitch fix just you
at girly scout one and I'll give her
some suggestions please Plus Jenna you
tried the Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour highlighters what do you think
i've swatched them i tried them when i
went to my contour class for sephora and
i did like what I saw definitely i don't
think that i'm going to be buying any
but they seemed very very nice from
initial use of them but but i don't own
them oh yeah they seem great they seem
fabulous d and australia sad i have to
go bit go to bed soon I know it's so
late it's probably won't close to one
o'clock in the morning there if you're
still here let's see ok Leanne and Nikki
are going back and forth about the
discussing the coffee break with Danny
Kwon from colour-pop hey Joanne hi Joey

but hello johana crystal good morning to
crystal happy father's day the job from
Crystal she got her old laptop out so
she could chat so glad that you're here
crystal thank you for being here Lance
talking about the talking about the
coffee break with Danny quad again let's
see I'm glad you're having a nice
conversation about that that makes me
happy steph says honestly I haven't used
the hourglass blush palette in months
you know I got one hour glass blush and
before the palette came out and I ended
up returning it because it just wasn't
amazing for the price for me my friend
Susan w loves the hourglass blushes it's
there like her favorites personally for
me I didn't find that they were fabulous
for me they're nice they're definitely
nice but definitely not worth the price
point for me for those but I know a lot
of people really love them I was
thinking yesterday when i was doing my
makeup I tend to grab the bomb instead
meet you me too let's see if he's
excited that someone else got the Volt
she wants to UM something them to post a
picture on the app I'm hoping that the
Android version comes out soon I'm
really hoping because I want a lot of
you to be able to go on because we're
really having fun and I can't wait for
the Android version to come out but
we're having we're having fun so far
it's where we're having great
conversation so it's good stuff dan
abella yet Jana made it in yay hello my
dear hello uh let's see Nikki she even
made a video explaining because so many
people were disappointed oh really hmm
talking about Danny in the quad again
interesting interesting well I saw I did
see um a little bit of that video I'm
not I can't I have trouble connecting
with Danny for various reasons um so I
don't watch whenever I do watch one of
her videos i usually don't watch it for
very long just kind of gather some
information i do feel like she puts out
a quality channel she gives a lot of
valuable information but it's just not
my cup of tea you know but but when i
did watch the little bit of it I saw the
whole transfer should talk about how the
whole
transforming thing and how it all works
I one thing that I think would be
interesting to try if you do own it let
me know if this works to maybe use it
with eyeliner to see whether it can
transform eyeliner IE i got from
Victoria's Secret back a really long
time ago they had a transforming
eyeliner that was really really cool
where you could use any like a black
eyeliner and then you would put the
transforming color over it and there
were different shades of the
transformant color so you could make it
like an iridescent purple or an
iridescent green or iridescent blue it
was really really cool I don't know what
happened to that product it was by
victoria secret and i loved it so I
wonder if you could do that with her eye
shadows to put it over an eyeliner just
an idea just an idea but ooh I don't
know I don't know what she went out on a
limb doing something different and I
admire her for doing something creative
because there's so many typical things
out there that are happening and I think
that it's wonderful when people do
things that are out of the box thinking
so that's pretty awesome let's see Nikki
oh I already got the part umm Danah
Bella Howard jen how are you doing I'm
doing fabulous unfortunately only have
about 8 minutes left to chat with you
guys because it's Father's Day I'm have
to go on time today but um but yeah I'm
doing great everything's good I feel
good that the school year is wrapped up
and done um you know and I can enjoy
some summer with my family and with you
making more videos I'm really excited
about that let's see and what's next ok
um and then you send us asking about the
Transformers key key gen if you tried
the new steel a summer liquid lipstick i
ordered a few colors but i want to know
if you've tried them i haven't we
posting some swatches on the app when i
get them good thank you Kiki for doing
that for putting some swatches on the
app I appreciate that a lot no I have
not tried them i I've heard they're
fabulous though so um yeah hopefully
they'll go on hautelook eventually and
i'll get some stila is famous for
putting a lot of their stuff on
hautelook which is awesome let's see
Nikki oh she's just she's just ragging
on Danny about that you know that she
has to explain how the eyeshadows work
and she was really excited about it hmm
I don't know man
there indique anyone's and coconut is
very bright peacock teal shimmery colors
pretty wear it as a line I where she
wears it as a liner cool and the Danny
quad is a matter of personal preference
i think that's what it sounds like to me
as well they worked well the Urban Decay
liner with Mia prime my eyes and use it
in the outer corner that's good to know
very cool Nicole Mike sounds great oh
good i'm so glad i bought 13 months ago
but I've never figured out how to hook
it up was it difficult this one was
really easy this is called a Yeti and i
just plugged it in and that was it just
plugged it in it's really cool to I'll
show you what it looks like let me see
if I can do this without making too much
noise but it's super neat it's really
heavy too BAM it's like this crazy like
crazy thing but I'm super excited about
it um I feel like such a pro and then
I've got this like thing here to like
block my puffs you guys see that I don't
have it on the UM on the view so
hopefully you guys saw that well yeah
I'm really excited about it I'm glad it
sounds good good i'm so glad because i
know that with the chat sometimes that
the volume has been a little off so
alright let's see so yeah i just pulled
it out of the box and i plugged it in
and that was it it was super easy you're
saying a gin maybe you could do a panel
you have multiple people on those live
chats through google hangouts you know
what you send yeah i'm trying i spent
about an hour and a half with lily and
with kathy from thrift thick with from
thrift nick earlier in the week trying
to figure out the google hangout and how
to do multiple screens the on the goal
for the chat is to have guessed people
on every week to have a different person
but what's happening is the only way we
figured out to do it is that it switches
back and forth so if i talk you see me
on screen oh no my thing fell off and if
i talk you see me full screen and if
then if Cassie was talking you would see
her full screen and we didn't like that
we felt like that was very distracting
and annoying so we need to figure out a
way to get I'm just going to take this
thing off his wrongs done anyway um we
need to figure out a way to get it so
that the person is in a corner or
something I'm trying to figure out how
to do that if anybody knows how to do
google hangouts and how to get multiple
people on the screen
time please send me an email because I
am we tried for like an hour and half to
figure it out and could not figure it
out and I've looked at tutorials online
and I just I can't figure it out I don't
I don't know I can't figure it out so
yeah I don't know but that's that's the
idea for Chad that's exactly what we're
planning on doing and Cassie from thrift
thick it's going to be the first guest
followed by Lily Spurgeon and then I've
got a couple people lined up Kristen
