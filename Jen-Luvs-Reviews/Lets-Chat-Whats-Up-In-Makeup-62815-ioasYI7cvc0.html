up and make up chat oh my goodness I on
YouTube is not my friend this morning so
the stoop did I not put this on I meant
to put this on hold on the middle
sharing something to Instagram telling
people oh so I was up to like three
o'clock in the morning I uploaded the
video everything was fine it's a video
processing blah blah blah so I closed my
computer went to bed I woke up and
nothing in process like it was like are
you kidding me like it had uploaded
completely at that point it's on YouTube
server and all it needs to his process
so but it never process so it is still
at zero percent so I waited a little
while I open up my computer wait a
little while to see if it would work
didn't work so i deleted the video re
uploaded it and then it said it had nine
what does it say 983 minutes remaining
for the video to be uploaded and it's
like are you kidding me like for real so
now it's at 212 minutes i guess it cut
down but so there's issues right now
with the UM with news so i apologize for
any inconvenience this may cause i'm not
going to spend forever talking about it
because I know it's not any fun to
listen to me talk about that the other
thing is i am using my mic again this
week last week though when it when it
recorded it was a little bit of a delay
but i think that's worth the quality
change that like half of a second or
quarter of a second delay so if the
delay on here annoys you really bad let
me know and i'll stop using the mic but
i really like the sound quality than
like so i'm hoping people that are
watching this um you know after the fact
can you know bypass that you know and be
okay with that so let me go ahead and go
over and see if there are any comments
in the chat where even is the chat where
are you here it is let me see if it's
even live or we even live yes it says
we're live so that's a good thing okay
it's loading the room yay okay thank
goodness at least something is working
this morning oh my goodness I told my
kids i was like i'm having issues today
you're gonna have to get your own
breakfast to like my daughter seven so
she can like work out a bowl serie on
stuff and you know they'll work out
like a real breakfast after we're done
but oh my goodness what a mess okay so
there's lots of good questions already
in the chat I'm excited to see you guys
this morning Oh despite all my issues
okay let's just jump right in amanda
says jen i bought the Too Faced better
than sex mascara poirier what's up a
makeup news okay so i finally got and i
put it on and did what it was supposed
to do however like after about two hours
of where it started flaking off I was
upset because it's a product everybody's
been raving about mmm too much hype not
enough proof okay this was my feeling
about it I did own it I remember it
flaking just a bit my issue with that
was the clumping and how thick that
product is you have to really work that
brush in order to get it not to clump
that was not a mascara I would have
recommended to you but it just cuz it's
on the new doesn't mean I recommend it
just so you know um but yeah I mean
there's a lot of people you're right a
lot of people were recommending that
mascara a lot of people swear by it I
really think I don't know because you
said your issue was flaking my issue was
not flaking why is she was clumping and
I just didn't like the way it went on it
did i do remember flaking a little bit
though I'm with you I don't know man
just stinks it stinks I don't know
what's your experience with the the
better than sex mascara by a two-faced
I'm sure Amanda would would love some
advice you have any advice on how to get
that sucker to stay on and up flake off
Steph Silla good morning to you my dear
Tyler Tyler good morning to you my dear
hi hi Jenna make up new good morning
happy sunday i know you love kat von d
but what are your thoughts on her tattoo
liner coming out with limited edition
packaging i have been wanting to try it
i like the tattoo liner I like it a lot
but this is the thing I have the one
that wanted trooper the black one I had
tried there's that I have a sample size
now of the trooper the black one but I
got the gray one and I did not like it
at all did not like it it was it was
pretty terrible so like it wasn't opaque
and it just I was not a fan of the great
one so i can vouch for the black one
can't vouch for any of the other colors
so
that's kind of how I feel on that but if
you see the black with the
limited-edition packaging that might be
cool I haven't seen that yet I have not
seen that yet interesting to keep my
eyes out for if you see like a picture
of it will you email it to me Jenna I
appreciate it he are a good morning good
morning Kiki how are you my dear let's
see any kitty one hot one idiot we hate
hello I don't hate you not yet anyway I
hope I don't hate you that's funny when
a name man oh I don't like that name
though you're calling yourself an idiot
I'm sure you're not an idiot Tyler if
you're in a hurry what's one one or two
quick makeup products you like to slap
on before heading out the door eyeliner
I always wear eyeliner eyeliner is like
a must for me um i have my Too Faced
multiply I'm my Kat Von D oops sorry I
didn't mean to hit that hopefully that
wasn't loud I have my Jesse's girl of
course I need to get a new one of these
though I just tried to Jordana fab you
line er um and somebody said it just
needs to kind of like set for a while
for it to be good I was not a fan of
that at all look did not like it did not
and I guess that's all the ones i have I
feel like I have more more eyeliners
than this oh the other one that I try to
got this in my Ipsy this is the Knicks
um liquid eyeliner this stuff was
terrible man it was not terrible the
brush was terrible the brush was super
hard to work with like didn't go to a
point it was like flat at the top but oh
no I don't know but anyway eyeliner is
definitely a must and then knows what I
probably put on if I can only put on two
things I probably put on eyeliner
mascara or eyeliner I'm like a base
eyeshadow like something like neutral
like um I was talking to somebody
earlier this week about I shadow she
said she's having a heck of a time
finding eyeshadows that work for her and
where's mine this one the Loreal
infallible and iced latte this is an
amazing all over lid color for my skin
tone I love love love this one so maybe
I would put that on give a tour mascara
but definitely eyeliner great question I

have a five below near you do you have a
file on you because if you do oh if you
do girlfriend hold on I gotta find what
I did with it because I filmed the video
yesterday um I said well I'll tell you I
filmed the elf video yesterday the one
where i show you um i give you all of my
elf um all my recommendations on all the
elf products all this stuff and i got a
ton of dupes for you ton of deep so i
put palettes everywhere and then when i
was getting ready for chat just kind of
threw them all everywhere and i don't
know what i did with them oh goodness
okay hold on a minute contour contour
right that's what you wanted contour
know you wanted bronzer um drugstore
bronzers you have that contour for you
the elf contour palette is fab don't
forget Bronco um but but I was going
when I was going to tell you was city
color city color at five below their
cheek products are amazing like they're
so awesome with city color for cheek
products cheap cheap cheap if you have a
five below if you don't drugstore
bronzer see I haven't had good luck with
drugstore bronzers overall because they
always come out like orangie on me the
knicks ones are good the next blushes
that look like bronzers those are good
i'm trying to find one and support need
some serious decluttering
here's my next okay here it is this is
the NYX bronzer that I use this one's in
cocoa let me switch over to where I can
see myself so I can see whether you can
see but there's my next bronzer in cocoa
I really like this one a lot see if I
can swatch that for you but it's just
beautiful it's a beautiful beautiful
bronzer I only see if I can you brush
wash I know the lighting in here is
terrible that is going to change in my
new place I'm gonna get some good
lighting because I'll have room for it
oh you can't even see that there's no
way you'll be able to see that all right
but anyway Nick's bronzer and cocoa I
really like that one a lot any Nick's
brought egg NYX blush shade that you can
use for bronzer i would probably i would
say i would vouch for it you know i
haven't tried them all that formula is
really good hunting anything else if
anybody else has any drugstore bronzer
recommendations for um was it Krista go
ahead and at Krista for some drugstore
bronzes I've heard good things about the
NY seed is that the huge one the arrows
at wet and wild the one that's huge I've
heard good things about that one but
I've never personally tried it so I can
vouch for it but yeah if you find city
color city colors awesome I've got
people like trying trying to get the
news up it's going ok where it's we're
still at seven percent 200 270 minutes
remaining now driving me nuts ok alright
so Amanda so this is the question is it
really better than sex hmm LOL good
morning by the way I cannot answer that
because my students may be watching they
like to watch the chat so i will not go
into that um oh the the old idiot we
hate gin it's an old joke good i hope
you don't think you're an idiot yeah i
mean sometimes we can laugh at ourselves
l me there's anything wrong with
laughing at ourselves as long as we can
you know know that we're laughing
ourselves and not really think we're
idiots because i will be sad let's see
it says Apollo chatterjee
I wonder if there will be any good
fourth of July Sarah's on ulta paired
with five times points that would be a
good deal mm-hmm wouldn't that be nice
that would be fab I would love that yeah
we'll have to wait and see on that one
Sloane I've never been one wins one of
these chats is only for am where I live
oh my goodness Sloan Sloan you're
pushing a girlfriend oh my goodness wow
that's awesome though thank you for
being here I appreciate you being here
indicate Iran Jen also for the
colour-pop eyes out of the studio
eyeshadow brush packs on the color on
the lid is very cheap about three
dollars and there's a wall of elf
products at target yup I really like the
elf studio brushes a lot I do like some
of my my more expensive brushes better I
like my Real Techniques brushes better
my more expensive brushes are not Sigma
and those my favorite brushes are the
outer beauty brushes that's a brand
nobody ever talks about that I learned
about it I mats and I love those brushes
they're my faves they're very reasonably
priced I would recommend getting the
face brush set it's awesome and if you
like contouring damn detailing like
contour set they don't have good eye
brushes so they are going to give any
eye brushes but anyway that's good to
know that the the colour-pop eyeshadow
you can use that studio brush for that
I've just just been using my fingers and
then brush it using a brush to blend
where like if I want to do something up
in the crease I'll Pat the darker corner
color like out into my outer corner and
then I'll take a brush and blend it up
and that's been working pretty well for
me but that's very good to know yep 10
a.m. in new york city oh I Love New York
City it's one of my favorite places on
the whole planet let's see Hellena good
morning so happy that you are here Karen
good morning to you in Chicago nikki
says she's going to alta online but
she's not going to bear the store it's
gonna be too busy let's see apala says
she's she picked up the Vice limited
edition for their you nine dollars any
opinions on it I've heard mixed reviews
on it i've heard mixed reviews i have
the the original vice and the Vice three
so I just kind of pass on that one that
was back when i was watching coffee
break with danny i watched a review of
it and I just wasn't impressed with the
pallet so I decided to pass on that one
and there's a lot of colors that just
aren't colors that I use a lot of finite
with the Vice pallets in general that
there are a lot of colors that aren't
necessarily usable like everyday colors
you know like I don't know I don't know
I passed on it but if you don't have a
lot of colors and you want to try using
some colors then I'm curious to see how
that will work for you yep brownies
talking about the cease to do eyeshadow
brush picks up the colour-pop shadows
very well that is really good to know I
do own that I don't think I use is that
the one that's really short like the one
that goes really close to the to the the
ferrule like it's just very short I
don't use that one much if that's the
one you're talking about I don't use it
much but I should I should um nikki says
have I ever tried on Bo jozzie I think
that's why they pronounce it bushwa
butch Blasi I you know what the only
time I ever tried that brand is I try to
lip gloss by them i got it in a beauty
bag or something like i got i got it in
some subscription i think and it was
really thick and sticky and had a very
strong scent but i loved the shade but
that was a really long time ago i
haven't tried much since then but i know
that they're going to be having more of
their products in the states now that
cody has bought them so very excited
about that and we'd like to try more
products from them kim good morning to
you in ohio nikki says she loves the
vice limited edition that's good to know
let's see Jenna just emailed you the
tattoo liner pick it has a gun metal
packaging oh thank you so much Jenna I
appreciate that Krista love me some five
below oh good city color girlfriend I
can't vouch for any of the other
products but the cheek products are big
thumbs up blushes bronzers highlights
well maybe not the highlights blushers
bronzers contours go for it um I got the
to contour palettes I don't know what I
did with them though like this this room
is a disaster like I I don't even know I
don't know where anything is it's just
everywhere and rewire I want to find
them though cuz i want to show you and
then what in the world i did with them
what set I got the big huge one the big
huge bronzer blush palette thing and
it's fab let's say Sarah good morning to
you I am moving to a new house we're
going to rent we're going to be owned
this place we're going to sell this
place and we're renting so we're renting
first we're going to move first and then
we're going to put our house in the
market where you to clean it up real
nice and everything so yes thank you so
much I'm so excited I'm jonesing for a
new eye shadow palette mid to high-end
any suggestions girlfriend what you
gettin Lyla get my charger that's fine
no problem thank you for being so polite
and thoughtful I appreciate you so much
alright see you later I don't know if
you can see her crawling on the floor
probably not she's being so sweet thank
you so much for being so thoughtful baby
all right oh my gosh they just came back
from vacation yesterday they were with
my parents from Wednesday until
yesterday so I'm down I'm spending the
whole day with them well besides like my
packing and everything I've got to pack
a bunch of stuff but anyway whole topic
ok back to i shadow palettes mid to high
ends mid to high-end hmm i don't know
well I when I'm assuming you mean like
um like Sephora brands like two-faced
and like those kinds of because we're
not talking about like hi hi and we're
talking like your stuff cuz I don't own
any of those cuz I'm unlike that um
let's see I know I guess it just depends
on what you're looking for like you know
at different things like I know that
I've heard wonderful things about the
kat von d the matte shadow palette but i
love the interstellar as well the
interstellar is fabulous they have that
new chrysalis kit that is in what's up
and make up this week of which of course
you haven't seen because the stupid
video is at ten percent uploaded 232
minutes left um so there's a chrysalis
palette set and I don't have the
chrysalis palette I haven't personally
tried it but I've heard wonderful things
and you get a ton of stuff with it I
forget how much it is but you get a ton
of stuff with it which is a really good
deal um let's see just you know what
honestly
whatever to a two-phase palette calls
out to you one of these one of those
calls to you if you know one of the kat
von d pallets costs you one of the urban
decay naked palette calls to you I mean
I think it really just depends on what
you what kinds of shades you're
interested in because there are certain
brands that consistently put out good
product and I feel like these two faced
boxes are fabulous I feel like the you
know the urban decay naked palette you
can't go wrong with these that smoky
pallets coming out soon I feel like the
naked 3 is the one that people is tend
to shy away from the most so I would say
naked one and naked too even though i
don't own naked one or naked 3 and then
the kat von d the witch call it the kat
von d pallets are amazing though the
ones that are the rectangular ones are
fab so it's really whatever calls to you
um yeah I mean there's so many good
pallets out there so many paths I hope I
got the right price range in there for
you all right Nikki wants to know I
tried the city colored sun kissed yet
the one that has that's as big as
people's faces yes and I have one and I
can't find it and it doesn t crazy is it
in this bag I think I found it seeing it
like I'm such a mess Bray on this one
right here it is fab it is so fab I got
the one in bronze peach and the reason
why I chose this one is because the
cheek color and the other ones was very
very light and I wanted like an actual
cheek color but this is so fun Hughes
definitely bronzer not contour but let
me see if I can swatch these for you ok
let me switch over to this the screen so
I can see what I'm doing here because
most of the time I'm not looking at
myself I'm looking at the chat window so
there's a finger swatches and then let's
put bronzer no that was blush bronzer
highlight and of course the lighting in
here is terrible but you can see that
they are pigmented and they blend out
really nicely lasting power is okay it's
fine it's gonna last you through a
workday or school day but it's going to
be gone by the end of the day if you you
know or morning tonight you're
definitely gonna need such this up but
for five bucks man the stuff is also the
other the only other complaint
about this is that sometimes the pans
will pop out so that's a good thing if
you like to use Z palettes and things
like that these are pretty easy to get
out you can see how it's coming out of
course it just pushed it back in OC that
so that's my only complaint is that
they're not really in there super good
but I mean you're in this in this
hardcore packaging the other one
hopefully the other I don't think the
other ones in here though I don't know
where the other one is but I got the
contour kit and I really like that one a
lot to you so mad that I can't find it
oh I found it yes oh my gosh that show
you guys these this last week I don't
remember if I showed you these these are
like butter like but huh look at that
look at that highlight no joke man no
joke are you kidding me ok ok here we go
here we go here we go Oh Mary Mary BAM
look at that look at that or you what
what what what what 525 Uggla's mmm
there's nothing like good makeup to me
keep your school yes especially cheap
good makeup yes my eyebrows are is from
tissues fix my eyebrows alright moving
on all right so anyway there you go yes
Nikki I have tried to end fab all right
99 how excited are you for the new lorac
pellets are you going to review them I
am excited about them I'm excited to see
other people review them I am NOT
planning on purchasing them just because
I can only purchase so much in a month
and I have to pick and choose and this
month in June it was elf and color pop
those were my focuses of things that I
was purchasing um that's what I bought I
could have I thought about getting the
Smashbox contour kit but not contradict
the new one the big huge one the hashtag
shape matters i think is what it was I
thought about getting that one and yeah
I decided not to i decided to just load
up on elf and city color I got a bunch
of drug store stuff I went to the
drugstore and when a little crazy
because Savannah and stuff who I've been
friends with for a really long time
we're
do a 55 drugstore products under five
dollars top five I think it's July
eighth I think it's when that's going
live something like that so I did some
prep for that I got some lip products I
got some cheap products um to kind of
try out so I really been into getting a
lot of the less expensive stuff this
month who knows what I'm gonna get next
month whatever calls me but it probably
won't be the lorac stuff I don't know i
might break down you never know you
never know but i do think they look
really cool and I've seen really great
reviews Tim Talia said that the new
lorac pallets are fab so but I don't
know if I'm going to get them or not all
right Caroline says she likes the pixie
subtly Sunkist as a bronzer if you're
very fair that's good to know Karen
Urban Decay friends and fanatics sale
ends today twenty percent off highly
recommend the duochrome shade of tonic
and backfire thank you so much for that
care and we appreciate that let's say
that idiot one idiot we hate why is
those private sale ends today too I
think I think it does too and i think
the on what was the other one it was why
i sell and then there was another high n
1 i forget i talked about it last week
but that one ends today to Giorgio
Armani giorgio armani i think any kidney
1 i'm on a color pop nope i've spent
thirty bucks a month each month for the
last two months yeah i was on their
website i talked about it in the show
that will be up in two hundred
thirty-two minutes I talked about it the
show about the colour-pop thing and how
the website crashed when the lipstick
liquid lipsticks came out I talked about
that um I was on there causing part of
the problem because I was refreshing I
ended up getting some of the liquid
lipsticks because I thought all that
color pop stuff all the eyeshadows and
blushes and highlights and stuff and
then I was like you know what I can't do
a color pop video without some of these
liquid lipsticks like everybody's gonna
be like but what about the liquid
lipsticks we already know the eyeshadows
are amazing we already know that the
blushes and the highlighter you know we
know about that already what about the
liquid lipsticks so I felt kind of a
moral YouTube obligation to buy some you
know we justified things in life so I
bought some and we'll be reviewing those
in them though I would imagine I only
take me a day or two to kind of figure
out what's the deal is with those so
as soon as I get those i'm going to try
them out and shoot that video as soon as
possible the colour-pop review so I'm
with you as far as a call we pop no buy
it is easy it's almost like collecting I
feel like with color public that you
want the collection like like almost
like collecting baseball cards where you
know or whatever like you just want
everything you want you want a
collection like I wit you know be cool
is if like there was some way to display
all the color pop I shadows or whatever
you know where you like color pops sort
some kind of display did you like put up
almost like baseball cards you know like
or some kind of book or something to put
them in I don't know you mean that
logistically that makes no sense but you
know as people could you know get their
collection all together because I feel
like all those singles everywhere is
going to be a hot mess once i get too
many of them but we'll see i wish they
would come out with like actual press
pallets i'm sure they will eventually
but yah know alright but anyway child's
child spt be hello good morning good
morning to kathy let's see Oh leo good
morning to Leo I gotta put that in my
mind when I see that that name it's Leo
Leo leo all right do I drink coffee yes
I do I happen to enjoy coffee amy says
tenure so people thank you Amy I
appreciate that my dear thank you so
much Christy good morning could you
recommend any good hair care for deep
moisturizing alright so let me show you
what i did on okay I can't vouch for
this yet but I got this I want to do
some more research on it and I see I
don't think I don't know I only did this
once but this is just pure ho ho but oil
I got this off the coats Coastal Scents
website I left this on my hair for like
an hour and then got out of the shower
and then washed it out and I don't feel
like it really my hair still feels like
straw but it might be because of the
products i put in afterwards so I don't
know man and this is the thing about
moisturizing hair products is that a lot
of times a product will have so much
silicone in it that it'll feel like it's
moisturizing or feel super smooth but
it's not really moisturizing it's like a
fake moisturizing you know not to knock
silicone because silicone you know can
be do really nice things for the hair
but you know it's like not really
moisturizing when you think it is but
once let me just tell you these are
products that make my hair feel soft
ones that I like this is the chi argan
oil plus Moringa oil this is me see
right there I really like this stuff a
lot one that's at the drugstore that I
really like a lot that I got in beauty
box 5 i believe is this is macadamia oil
by a hask they sell these little ones I
think they're a dollar or two and then
they sell bigger ones but i would
recommend getting a smaller one this one
is the macadamia oil but i'm pretty sure
they saw argan oil as well so this is a
really nice one what else do i use this
i got at the at the salon this is the
healing care color care or trauma
treatment and i found I've had really
good results with this I got this at the
salon I think it was really expensive
than I once it was like 20 25 bucks
something like that let's say anything
else just sure argan oil is very nice so
anything else that I use a lot I mean I
use all kinds of hair oils and things
let me see if anything else stands out
to me something that I've been using a
lot of my man I think those are pretty
much it i mean like i have some pure
argan oil that i really like that I use
sometimes but i would say these three
are the ones that i'm using most right
now i think i have a cheat this is the
chi 1 there was another chi one there
was a red chin one that i was using
maybe I used it up and I remember what
it was but yes I would definitely
recommend those those three this one
surprisingly is one of my favorites
though and it's super cheap so would
recommend that one all right Kiki says
crown brushes are amazing i have had
hidden mrs. with crown brush i had some
really strong hits and some really
terrible mrs. i got a pink brush set
from crown brush and I swear Kiki there
were like three of those brushes I could
use like they were so like they were not
dense at all they did nothing for me I
know what happened to them because they
were just terrible I think maybe I ended
up using one for the long term but I
know that crown brush has done a lot of
work other brushes since I bought that
and I have a couple of crown brushes a
couple their eye shadow brushes that are
you
a lot so there you go but yes I would
agree with you I think that you know you
can kind of look at them and see I
definitely recommend looking at along
reviews before buying crown brushes
especially the sets I worry about the
sets the individual brushes I've had
better luck with Kiki do you have any
suggestions on specific crown brushes
that you like that you could recommend
because that would be amazing good
morning Lily how are you hey Lily guess
what what's up in makeup is going to be
on live in 232 minutes because YouTube

is wonderful okay um Leo this when
you're saying you're saying talk to me
i'm bored leo um sweetheart that makes
it really difficult for me to answer
questions when this isn't really a chat
room as much as it's a place to converse
about makeup so just I mean people can
talk to you if they want to but it makes
it kind of difficult for me to know
what's happening as far as the
conversation that we're having here so I
don't know if this is the best place to
just have people chat with you off topic
but if you want to chat about makeup you
can feel free to jump in anytime Christa
thanks for the suggestion guys but pop
about trying to feed an angry baby right

fades and it's not super pigmented um
and then i said the the Urban Decay the

living insta Fresno California but we'll
be traveling to lansing michigan next
weekend they have a five below so
excited to check it out any other places
we don't have on the west coast um I
can't I don't you know i'm not sure what
places we have here that you don't have
um you guys have seen what is it um rite
aid's that have Jessie's Girl cosmetics
there's some rite aids and have a lot of
Jessie's Girl cosmetics and julieg nail
polishes I've heard the new line Lily
said the new line isn't very
but the older Jesse scroll nail polishes
are awesome I'm trying to think what
else we have here that you don't have I
don't know if you have any suggestions
for Amanda for East Coast stores that
she should check out definitely um tag
her I'm at Amanda let's see has my appt
come out on android yet no it's supposed
to be coming out on android in the
middle of july sandra thinking about
picking up the Born This Way foundations
thoughts on coverage and where yes i
will give that to you i have i have to
mix these two to get my skin tone i'm
still trying to work out my perfect skin
to him with these two i have in vanilla
and light beige and not these with FC
points um it is i would say me at least
medium coverage I believe I feel like
you can build up to full coverage I
don't have a lot of skin problems so
it's hard for me to tell what it would
cover on somebody with more skin
problems but it's definitely a more full
coverage foundation I don't feel like it
makes me look natural it also creases
under my eyes I was talking to a couple
people last week about not putting
foundation on your eyes but I don't know
how to do that like I feel like I don't
know I guess you can put concealer under
your eyes and not put the foundation on
your eyes I don't know but this crease
is like crazy under my eyes and I've
never had a foundation crease under my
eyes ever and it's like literally within
like 20 minutes of putting this on I've
got creasing and then like I all I have
to do is blend it and then it's fine and
then it's just creasing again that's
like what is going on with this so
personally I this is not going to do
recommend for me just because of that
and because it doesn't have a natural
finish that I was expecting just for my
particular skin tone skin type it I'm
not the biggest fan of it when your time
is pretty good though where time is nice
but it just it's just an ok foundation
for me I don't feel like it's worth the
price which makes me sex I had really
high expectations for it um yeah I know
mmm ok let's see um ok you want to see
the my tattoo on my shoulder let me
switch over it's it's been a long time
since it's been loved
okay so you know okay so Oh back here so
this is the owl from the from labyrinth
and then this is Falkor from the
neverending story I don't know if you
can see you see if I can get up a little
closer and that's Bastian on the back
he's going yeah this is when they're
like chasing the boys at the end of the
movie so yes so that is that do I have I
don't have anything else on my back then
I can show you everything just down
lower like down here whoa like town I've
got a bunch of stuff down there i know

house and we're just so overgrown like
we've outgrown this house like crazy
it's so small one day I'll give you a
house tour I won't really want to do a
howl swear wants me like well I mean at

tour of the new house know how about
that all right um so thank you so much

showed a little while ago the city color
the scientist trio and then also we put
it up here when I put it I don't know
where I put it and then the contour okay

better than I do you probably saw where
I put it down I couldn't gone far
because I've been sitting here the whole
time but yeah the console oh here it is
yep it was underneath my phone the
contour effects but here with the
swatches of those I mean from from here

these three are the circular one and
then these three are the contour like

Urban Decay versions and they're just

Fleck us everybody knows who i'm talking
to when i say Leanne good morning to you
my dear good to see you um yep twenty
percent off Urban Decay today very good
thank you so much for that
and also the fault is ansa Forest
website I meant to mention that in this
week's show that is not uploaded yet 232
minutes it hasn't moved past ten percent
this is driving me nuts um so anyway yes
thank you so much for that Liam okay
indie kitty 1gen i'm on the colour-pop
know by thirty bucks a month is more
than I need yes it's so easy to do
though it's so easy to do Steph I didn't
know this you guys probably do but it
looks like if you buy $25 with Alta
makeup you will get a ten-dollar Alton
gift card sent to you online at least oh
that's interesting I did not know that
all right I have to scroll down and this
is usually where I lose my spot so
hopefully I can find it again I'm going
to do one more question before I have to
hit that button Jessica good morning got
my new toothpaste blushes in about a
week ago and they're amazing really
long-lasting I knew right oh I'm at the
new ones the heart shaped ones very cool
i would expect them to be amazing
alright so i'm gonna go ahead and I'm
gonna hit that button oh no it's working
okay sometimes it skips all the way down
and I have to find my place and it's
really annoying ok so we've got about 15
minutes left and then I got it I got to
hang out with my kids um Lee Anne says
uh she's laughing Jen crash the crash
colour-pop it was all my fault I did it
it's all my fault I be hitting refresh
over and over again I killed it I know I
was part of the problem I for three
hours couldn't get the liquid lipsticks
Kiki oh that makes me so sad Kiki oh my
goodness it makes me sad because I'm
sure you would look gorgeous in some of
those shades those bright shades Kiki
puts up her pictures up on the what's up
and makeup at all the time with these
gorgeous lip colors of all people Kiki
you should have been able to get them
that makes me so sad uh breaks my heart
Kiki it breaks my heart oh no ok now it
just skipped down know what's going to
do it eventually ok ok oh my man I gotta
find my spot again ok
oh my goodness i'm way behind okay
always happens i just saw nets here good
morning and nets a 192 point oh my
girlfriends she was one of my first
youtube friends and that i just saw you
were here hi Annette I know I'm in I'm
like way behind okay i just found
shannon about moving desks a good
morning to Cathy I know if I said good
morning to cafe good morning kathy if i
missed it i'm almost they are almost
there almost there almost there okay yes
I'm there okay Oh Nikki says she's so
upset about the color pop server debacle
I know I know but I mean I expected it I
knew I you know when you got like you
know like the morphe thing with jaclyn
hill palette you know it's gonna happen
it's gonna happen it's it's their
smaller they smaller servers it's gonna
have them you know i mean it did anybody
die no well I'll be all right I'll be
all right but still I mean I can
understand and you know what was
happening to me is that I accidentally
added a liquid lipsticks that I didn't
want first I realize didn't want it I
was trying to delete it and I wouldn't
let me delete it um and then I was
trying to add things it wouldn't let me
add everything that I wanted like it
took forever get the cart where I wanted
to be and I probably would purchase more
things if the cart hadn't been being so
frustrating you know getting all the
things that i wanted i probably spent
twice as much as i did because i wanted
to get some more shadows i ended up only
being able to add one shadow and i
really wanted to get more than that but
the cart was being weird so I'm with you
I mean it stinks but I mean internet
problems it stinks right now that stupid
you know YouTube is not uploading what's
up and makeup it's driving me nuts 230
two minutes remaining it still says ten
percent like why why why does it still
say ten percent there must be a lot of
people uploading videos today or
something I don't know um Boston Barbie
doll says they look so dry and we'll
have to chill have to see we'll have to
see i will definitely let you
no because you know I'm going to tell
you if the drawing leann let me see we
instantly and says she's Shannon thank
God I wasn't on color pop yeah I mean it
wasn't in the end of the world but they
hmm indie kitty 1gen literally they have
collections the Monday in silverlake
collection I want oh you're talking
about the that wet and wild the Silver
Lake one silver lake collection Lily got
a couple of those last night all things
the Silver Lake got some wet and wild
shadows and they looked amazing Karen
what is considered to be long-lasting
the number of hours when you're not
doing anything like eating or drinking
um you talk about lip products is what I
think you're talking about when I say
long-lasting like I have lip products
that will last all my lips like they
will still stay my lips to the point
where even after i eat and drink they
will still be there like the Urban Decay
the revolution lipsticks are amazing
like I will put this on and then four or
five hours later after I've eaten in
eaten and drunk drank drunk drink drank
drunk after i have used my lips for
nourishment I um I have these they're
still on you can still see them they're
not as glossy as they were but i can
still definitely see the color it's
they're amazing where you know some lip
products though one should eat or drink
they're gone completely so that's what
I'm talking about when I say
long-lasting I when I say something's
long-lasting it means it has made it
through eating and drinking so hopefully
that answers your question all right
Nikki a lot of gals make a magnetic
board for them Oh Tom at the color pop I
shadows there are a lot of DIY she says
she's going to be doing one soon very
cool very cool Jenna cupcake stands for
super cute for this cupcake stands are
super cute for displaying color pop
that's good to know thank you so much
for that Lily don't companies realize
they have such a huge hype that when
they released something that's so hot
they will have to upgrade their servers
you would think you would think yeah I
mean I guess they just I don't know I
don't know I mean they'll fix it though
they'll fix it but yeah I mean they
would have made even more money if they
upgraded their server and made it so
everybody could have purchased they
would have made a lot more money so you
know I'm with you Lily I hear you the
gold digger good morning to you my dear
in Chicago you don't know me I got
laughed at when I'm at the gym because I
wear my makeup during your workout and
it stays on well you know when you're at
work all day and you go to the gym and
you got makeup on that's what happens
that's what happens all right um going
down still okay we got about ten minutes
left and then I go spend some time with
my kids Sarah so when you have your new
makeup filming room you can take all of
your color pop singles and create a
fring magnetic board I love Pinterest
take a magnet on the back of the pots
and hang it up I want to do something
like that there was somebody on the
what's of makeup app that had done that
with their palates they had behind them
um you know magnetic board and then they
had stuck some of their more beautiful
palettes up on display and it looked so
pretty I would really love to do that
would really love to do that we'll have
to see you know how things go I bought a
couple of frames pictures from hautelook
that I really really like that I want to
hang up as well so I haven't quite
decided but that's a really great idea
um let's say a Paula says when the
shadows dry out maybe are you talking
about like like I hanging them up or
something I don't know I'm not really
sure what's going on there let's say you
don't know me says are you going to have
a room just for filming a makeup in the
new house yes yes I am sooo excited

crap but the individual ones I think are
better um she says she likes the Coastal
Scents brushes better I I like the
Coastal Scents brush sets as well I have
the one they sent me for review it's on
like a leather looking snap case I
forget what it's called but it's like
God I'm stitching on the side and then
you open up in this brushes inside and i
love that set I have it in my gym bag
and that's what I use for the gym when I
go to the gym and I love that set it's
so fab um and I'm not just saying that
cuz i sent to me for review because you
guys know I don't do that i mean there's
a few brushes in there that i don't
really use but for the most part use
every single brush in there i think it's
like 50 bucks or something for the set

I got from them but in an awesome
midnight blue I don't know who she's
talking to ok Steph thanks for trying to
help Amy I appreciate it thank you for a
polyp for talking to Amy um let's say
okay I'm trying to find a question real
quick before um okay 99 do you have any
tips on how to match lipstick colors to
I looks this is something that I fan all
that so you really use some suggestions
from everyone thanks okay this is gonna
be my last question because it's eleven
o'clock okay matching lipsticks eye
color month is I don't ever miss the
personal this is me personally so other
people may have other things they do but
I don't do bright with bright if I have
bright eyes I don't do a bright lip if I
have a bright lip I don't do bright eyes
and a lot of times I'll just do neutral
neutral because that's just me I like
neutral neutral um but as far as
matching colors um like like if I go
coral with my eyeshadows if I do like
orange corals I do orange quarrels with
my lips if I do warm um like warm
berries and things like that and then
I'll do warm berries on my lips for
natural like brown eye shadows you can
pretty much do anything with your lips
um you want to go with your skin tone as
much as possible so if you're more olive
skin toned try to think how this works
okay olive skin tone I don't know I you
know I'm not going to represent I always
get confused because I'm neutral so it
doesn't matter to me so I always get
confused as far as which skin tones are
which shades or whatever you guys
probably know better than I do but I
don't want to mess it up and look like
an idiot so um but yeah but anyway as
far as matching the I shots with the
lipstick I just tried to go opposite
bright bright and then the other one is
going like if I go corals then I go
quarrels my lips and if i go berries it
go berries on my lips and cheeks you
know what I'm saying like I try to keep
it the same but if you're doing Browns
if you're doing neutrals then you can
pretty much do anything with your lips
that you want to do so that's that's
kind of where I go with it other people
may have two other ways they do it but
that's kind
what I think of a paula is answering you
as well she's saying I generally do nude
eyes with a bright lips bright smoky eye
is a new dish flip yep I'm with you
girlfriend and then ok so we are you
guys are answering each other ok so it's
1101 I have to spend some time with my
kids they have been so amazing and you
know being independent and I want to
spend some time with them what's of the
makeup i'll give you the current think
it's still at ten percent it still says
230 two minutes I don't know when this
is going to be ready i may try to upload
it again but if you could spread the
word to anybody that may be waiting I
feel terrible I I'm trying to get it up
