up her makeup chat it's so good to see
you this morning oh what a wonderful
morning I am so tired so please bear
with me I feel like my brain is not in
my head so I hope it don't say something
stupid stay tuned for Jenna say she'll
be stupid uh yeah so this is the last
chat they will be in this room with this
craziness behind us oh look listen to my
voice echoing can you hear that i forgot
to pause the chat room okay now I've got
my own voice uh whatever pause muted
anyway how are you this morning it is so
good to see you i feel like i'm talking
like oh was that romper room when the
lady was like hello Billy Billy is here
and Janie is here and hello nice i can
say i can go through and i can be like
oh hello liz is here and as Laney is
here alone Laney and nikki is here in
Emily in Atlanta good morning my friends
how are you enough goofiness I'm just so
tired oh my gosh okay but anyway I
really need to work out a better
schedule fits all what to the makeup
business anyway alright so let's go
ahead and jump into the questions for
Chad I got one in my email box that I
wanted to answer from Gail he usually
makes it to chat she can't make it she's
going to her parents 50th wedding
anniversary party but her question was
for nail stamping what brands of plates
do you use I use the ones from the born
pretty store those are my favs
unfortunately they're packed so I cannot
show them to you but the place where the
points pretty store or fab and they're
not super expensive i love those for
nail stamping the key to nail stamping I
really feel like these don't know the
nail stamping I have a whole video on it
if you just type in nail stamping and
search my videos you'll find the one or
just nail stamping in general um you
know it makes a design on your nails I
think the biggest thing that I'm finding
with nail stamping that I run into
trouble with is the print not showing up
and not to do to not using a thick
enough polish so really
looking at the way that the Polish lays
on the plate making sure that it is in
the grooves of the plate and then um you
know really just making sure that it
looks like it's there and then when you
push it on the stamp or making sure that
it's all on the Stamper because if it's
not you're probably using too thin of a
polish and the other thing is the
Stamper itself of its not picking up
evenly on the Stamper it's probably not
going to stamp your nails so those are
the ones that I use and once you she's a
nice and happy summer happy summer back
to Yale so let's go ahead and talk to
the people that are here this week Liz
says jen thanks rehoboth today you are
so welcome Liz Liz was the very first
person to download download the Android
app she was my guinea pig yesterday to
see whether it actually work and I don't
understand why it is not in english i
emailed the creator's about it they um
their native language I don't believe
this english i believe it's Japanese um
so I believe that's Japanese I am NOT
going to assume but I their their names
sound um japanese to me i don't want to
say their names just in case but i have
a feeling they're Japanese so anyway
hopefully they will be able to translate
it to english soon and i was a little
surprised to see that the android app
was in Japanese but hopefully I'll be
able to fix that soon but yes so anyway
gosh I'm so tired I probably I can't
even oh my gosh I'm like rambling ah so
okay Liz anyway thanks for being my
testimony yesterday I appreciate it and
I'm exciting you got to download the app
let's say you don't know me good morning
my dear lady good morning bro bows
before Bros good morning my dear you
have to remind me again tumblr style
girl have to remember that that's you
how am i doing today I'm really tired
today I was up late because that one day
that the the show wasn't ready because I
let it like roll over night and it never
never I put it on I uploaded it to
YouTube the one time these are my very
first sips of coffee hopefully it'll get
better is this jacket goes on I uploaded
the video to each of a few weeks ago and
then I went to bed and when I woke up it
didn't have her processed so the show
went up like half an hour 45 minutes
late maybe I forget how long
but I don't want to do that again so I'm
now like it takes two hours for whatever
reason for this video to render on my
computer so I finished up the video in
about 113 something like that so 330 it
was done rendering so I set my alarm to
get up got up uploaded it to YouTube the
description was too long so i had to
choice but like half an hour shopping on
the description because youtube if the
description is too long it won't let me
put it in so i spent a while doing that
then i realized i didn't finish my
thumbnail so i was up for a while doing
that and then I had an alarm again to
make sure if i woke up so that it to
make sure that it oh my gosh excuse me I
said alarm again to make sure that it
had actually gotten onto youtube so i
woke up again you know and then I
trouble going back to sleep in those
masks anyway enough about that let's
talk about things that are a lot more
fun than why I'm exhausted but I'm
exhausted so that's how I have today I'm
Matt I'm very happy Nikki good morning
to you my dear Emily good morning I'm
glad that you are here Emily a man's a
good morning to you and she says OMG jen
i was starting starting what's up in
makeup and i was scrolling through the
description and I squeal Valley so Ellie
that my mom said something epic to me
but I was installing now I'm so glad I'm
so glad Oh it'll be great to have you on
the Alpha Banda makeup news hot new by
Jenna hi Jen good morning i'm sending a
package this week one Thank You Jenna I
appreciate that John is a rep for Jenna
your company just slipped out of my head
the one that you are you sell for and I
totally just slipped out of my head and
I apologize if you say it I will say it
on so that everybody knows what it is so
i apologize i just totally went out of
my head I know if it's in my brain
somewhere it's just not there right now
but the holiday our glass palette yes
that thing looks amazing I know I'm not
bye but it looks fab now I'm gonna go
and swatches it I'm gonna go in and
watch that hourglass palette if you
haven't seen the show yet out the
hourglass palette is like six hourglass
highlights blushes bronzer things and it
looks amazing but I probably won't get
it I have the ambient lighting it'll be
really smart of them not to use these
same shades the dim light incandescent
like really be really smart of them i'm
curious to see whether they did the
exact same shades it looks very similar
so i probably won't get it that's
something i have not patched yet because
i love that thing alright let's see
those before Bros what is your what is
your first name my dear so i can call
you by your first name instead of saying
tumblr style girl do you know what Kat
Von D and candy Johnson collections when
no I have no idea when that's coming out
the kat von d Kenny Johnson collection I
have no idea i am not an insider it may
seem like i have inside information but
i don't all of my information that i get
for the show comes from instagram and
twitter and blogs and also from scouring
websites so like I go on sephora and
then i have a sephora reporter also and
together we kind of look through and
sift through so forth website finding
things i don't get like notifications
from companies or anything when they
when they have new products except for
mba cosmetics so I don't have any site
information especially go like kat von d
kandeejohnson collabs I wish I did
that'd be awesome good morning to Kim
you don't know me yes android app is
available for download there's a lake
under the what's of the makeup video
very exciting Nikki exciting to me
exciting to me the android gals i'm glad
the app is for all me to meet soon
really happy about that i did email for
those of you that are on the iphone
we're on the iphone app i did email the
creator's the suggestions they said that
they would really like to do suggestions
they have a lot of apps if they're
juggling so they would really like to do
some of those suggestions in the future
they just don't know when or if they're
going to happen so they're going to keep
me updated but they were definitely open
to hearing them so if you have any
suggestions my new android users you
have any suggestions on how to make the
better I will be happy to send them over
the creator's I don't know how much is
going to change I think we're kind of
going to have the app as is I'd be very
surprised if they make changes if it at
they might they could but I don't know
how many changes they're actually going
to do I mean we've got a functional
community over there it's not ideal it's
not as cool as Instagram as far as the
things that it does there's a lot of
things that I wish it did that it
doesn't do but you know it's still in
the baby stages so hopefully as the
community grows and they realize that
they're going to make more ad revenue
off of it because more people download
it I don't make anything off of AD
revenue by the way as more people
download it maybe they'll go consider
making more changes so I think the more
we show them that it's worth the changes
the more they will change things just
through numbers I think that's the only
way we're going to do it but I think
we've got a great community over there
you know the apps not perfect but it's
good it's not perfect but i think that
people over there what's great people
are what makes it wonderful and it's
functional it works well it doesn't
crash it's good at and a great community
all right let's see good morning Sandra
so good to see you Liz ok all right
Tyler good morning my dear she's just
download the android app that showed up
in a different language in the app store
but it was the right app yes can't wait
to go play with it yes it is I think
it's Japanese I think that's the the
home language of the people that I'm
talking to they are based I believe
they're based in the United States but I
believe their native language is
Japanese let's see her wow the idea yes
I finally made it early yes I'm so glad
you're here Lainey I'm looking for it
but can't find it yet it is not in the
search I think it's because the all the
description is in Japanese but if you go
to the link underneath the youtube video
underneath the what's up and make a
video if you click on that you can
download it from there I know it's weird
I wish I could be more of a description
underneath the link but like I said
YouTube only allow so much in that box
and I have my limit like mad
limit this week as far as things I could
put in the box so oh well but yeah it
looks weird but that's definitely the
right one and you can't search for you
gotta click on that link Marlene hi it's
so good to see today's my daughter's
high school graduation party yeah
congratulations to your daughter that's
so exciting high school graduation in
July you must have your own school well
that's awesome though congratulations
graduation parties are so fun oh my
goodness so fun especially the high
school ones because the college ones can
go low price a drama film I hope she has
a wonderful day and I hope you have a
wonderful day of graduation party try
not to stress out take a deep breath
that's very exciting Kathy good morning
android app yay i'll be happy to see you
over there Kathy Nicki um I love romper
room when I was a kid me to talking
about when I was greeting everyone in
the morning yes so in the morning is it
as I'll tired I am ready forgetting I
was creating everyone like Rafa rooms
though alright let's see people are
congratulating Marlene so exciting um
yes you do have a right to bracket on
Marlene amy says hi I love to you Amy so
good to see you my dear Krista good
morning have you tried the make up for
ever matte foundation the ladies as a
for suggestible offense I do really like
it I have a mostly if I still have it in
my drawer yeah I haven't had my
foundation Jack I do have that written
um yeah I really like this foundation
it's got a really nice staying power um
it does dry down to Matt let me say I
have the shade with shady you don't know
what shade you are well shade are you
does not say I do you they don't know
what shade it is it doesn't even say
anywhere on here with the shade is I've
never actually looked to see what shade
this is weird okay but anyway let me
switch over to my view so I can see
myself show you kind of the texture and
consistency of it I don't know if you
tried it in a store or not but
mmm better do it that way so you can see
it's pretty thick it takes a while for
it to drip and then I would say it's
medium coverage if you need full
coverage this probably won't be for you
I haven't tried this on since winter
time you can see how it covered up that
freckle pretty well I mean I haven't
blended that completely but and of
course this camera quality is not fab
but did you see that freckle disappear
gone yeah it's really nice on my veins
are gone it's a really it's a nice
foundation i would definitely recommend
it I'm with the people at Sephora did
they give you a sample if they gave you
a sample that would be fab you should
ask them for a sample but you have my
freckles like completely going when they
see if I can I don't even know where my
freckle went it's like go on where did
you go freckle there you are right there
mmm it's like really my test freckle go
almost my test freckle good job
foundation you made me lose my test
freckle all right but anyway yes I do
really like it a lot I think that's a
good suggestion I do have normal skin
though so keep that in mind crust I
don't know what kind of skin you have as
far as normal wheelie combo dry I don't
know anything I can't speak to that but
for my normal skin I love it nikki says
hers is graduating next year oh baby
graduating I'm holding on to the years
Lyla will be in second grade next year
and John will be in officially in pre-k
he was in a school program last year but
he will officially be in pre-k next year
but Lyle is very excited for second
grade she's been practicing her math
facts i've been making your practice
addition and subtraction facts mostly
her addiction backs fishes in Norfolk's
so I wanted to know those things by the
time she hit 2nd grade I want him done
I'm such a mean mommy no I don't push
her um i told her i say mean she really
likes to learn so i told her you know
too
oh my gosh I cannot think today I'm
having serious issues this is probably
the most issues I've ever had a match at
all right I'm gonna shut up and talk but
anyway I told her she's not having fun
she doesn't have to practice her facts
but we got I got her and a half to play
with so but she's very excited about
second grade I so that's 10 years 10
years she'll be senior Oh can't even
imagine all right i'm trying i'm not
even gonna imagine i'm just gonna hold
on 27 years old for a little while all
right staff good morning to you my dear
LeeAnn how does some of your comments of
your comments so early I sit here and
hit refresh a couple minutes before 10
and when the link comes up the chat
starting there already several comments
oh man so I usually put the chat up at
least 15 minutes before it starts so if
you go to Google Plus you should have a
Google+ notification of of when the chat
is starting if you don't have a
notification if you go to my google plus
you'll see it there so that would be my
suggestion I don't know if that's how
you guys get into de commenting early
but I do put it up about 15 minutes
early I should do a notification out I
have to try try that next time I
remember to do like see if I can get it
to UM project out um when the chats
gonna start all right Jenny good morning
so what do we do we think of the morphe
brush pallets I've been looking for a
good matte palette how's that one on
hautelook I have no idea Jenny no idea
ionno like one morphe brush and it's one
of their less expensive ones and i don't
like it at all oh no that's not true i
also own I don't think that's true that
I don't like that brush but I also one
of their eyeshadow brushes that they do
like that one I don't have it though I
packed it I have a very very small
selection of brushes these are all the
brushes I kept out of course they're
dirty but these are the brushes that I
kept out to use out of this whole thing
this thing usually filled it's usually
packed oh and then I this one too these
are the ones I kept out to use it's like
does anybody need more brushes than this
apparently I do but apparently I don't
because I packed all the rest but
usually
that filled with brushes uh but I gosh
I'm self talking today um so anyway I
don't know if anybody knows about the
Murphy palettes that are on hautelook
are the brush Oh morphe brushes palettes
that's what you wanted to know so
anybody knows about them working but I
shutup alsa don't look please let jenny
know at Jenny good morning to Sherry

you are here yay hello Diana Nicky some
people buff their Stamper with a nail
file that isn't picking up well I have
heard that my friend is obsessed with
stamping I'm jelly because she is so
good it definitely takes practice
definitely takes practice even though
I've practiced a million times like a
soft rubble like my fourth of July nails
I still had trouble getting that one
nail on I took it off I think four or
five times trying to get it to go on so

love them equally I'm sorry Mary but I
you have competition because i really
love back as Oprah but but the quality
of those highlighters are amazing from
Becca so I'm not surprised that you were
absolutely loving your champagne pop
Shannon and I'm so glad you were loving
the app as well that makes me happy
Lanie found the app yay I'm so glad
perfectly posh jenna says her her
company is perfectly posh I'm going to
be doing a review for her of products
were perfectly polished I'm very excited
to review them for you they were
probably me I would imagine late August
is my prediction because I have to get
the box and I have to try everything so
mid to late august look for that review
of perfectly posh I'm Nikki my champagne
pop has mass tank power you're like the
first person I've heard as far as the
stank our wow okay is anyone else having
that same problem I am be very curious I
need to ask Kiki because God ok he's
been rocking and she's been putting up
all of her selfies on the what's the
makeup appt of her wearing shaking in
public every single day so I've to ask
Kiki what she thinks will flee kinky
will show up sometimes she's here
unknowing lost my spot I know I didn't
okay cool alright cams downloading the
app yay Nikki perfectly posh has some
nice stuff cool awesome Nikki oh I'm so
glad you'll have to tell me some of your
favorite things your link of morning and
I know you have a different name but I
can't remember what it is you have a
different name it's not just yodelling I
don't think I think you have a different
name I try to call people by their real
names when I learned them but i can't i
have so much trouble remembering names
is terrible um but anyway good morning
to you finally made it to another sunny
morning shot so good to see you just
wondering do you think it's worth
getting the Urban Decay smoky palette I
have nots watched it I have not I i
don't know i mean if I think that I
don't know man I think I have to put my
fingers in it to be able to decide I
tried to get my sister-in-law to get it
i texted her that it was available and I
did she didn't text me back so I don't
know if she's going to get it
they're trying to move now as well which
they weren't when we talked to
originally about her getting the naked
smoky palette so she might not get it
but I'll have to go on the store and
swatch it i wish i could get samples to
take home but i can't i think you know
it's one of those things where I or any
eyeshadow pouch truly truly truly must
haves truly you know I think that if it
costs you kind of like the three you
know the naked 3 with all those rose
gold chains if it calls to you I would
definitely say you should try it I mean
especially getting it waiting and
getting it at sephora also where you can
return it very easily if you don't like
it or if you don't feel like you're
going to use it that's what I do I'm big
on sephora has enough costs built and I
talk to people sephora about this
they've got so much um you know cushion
built in I just was I'm not using my
microphone today I totally forgot to use
my microphone oh um but anyway um
sephora has a lot of cushion built and
they make so much money girlfriend they
make so much money so they've got off
cushioned built in to pay for when
people don't like something and then
they return it so kids are going on a
bike ride with my husband which i think
is so awesome um but anyway so i would
personally if I were you if I will plan
on getting it I would get it at sephora
because that's the easiest place for me
to return it and then I would try it see
if I like it and if I didn't like it I
didn't think was worth it i would return
it especially if it was calling to me it
doesn't call to me so i'm not going to
get it but if it calls to you i would
say go for it but i would wait i would
wait since you don't do or makeup review
videos and you've got to get it on that
second um i would say just wait and then
get it from there I'm sure there'll be
plenty of them in the stores and things
I I mean it didn't sell out on Urban
Decay's website I think they've really
prepared for this I don't think they
intended for it to sell out I don't
think it's sold out it's a sold-out on
the Urban Decay website at this point I
don't think it is I know it wasn't a
couple days ago you look and see I'm
curious if it's sold out I'm looking
right now
oh no it is sold out it is sold out on
the Urban Decay website but it is going
to be available online at sephora.com an
old sitcom what would I say today today
maybe move is it today and look I mean
look there's a way for me to show you
guys what I'm searching for but I think
it takes a while to like a bit load and
everything let me say let me sort by
newest see if it's available right now I
don't see it where are you oh there it
is yep it's available right now if you
want it it says of available for sale
online 712 the available in stores on
716 so uh yeah that was a really long
answer okay but hopefully I helped you
all right Jenna saying she loves her
perfectly posh stuff yeah I mean if
you're selling and I'm assuming that
you've tried it and really liked it and
I did watch her one video Jen of all the
things you tried you're curious about
perfectly posh you can click on where it
says make up new and watch her a video
about perfectly posh I'm sure she has
her contact information if you want to
try to order anything from them um I'm
sure Jenna would love to help you with
that let's see staff the word wizard
hello my dear hello Nikki Jen do you
know any good gradual self tanners I
don't want to tan I don't want to tan
but I'm scared and don't want to look
like an oompa loompa okay I think it was
my favorites video i forgot recently i
put in a video about the st. Tropez
stuff that i've been using i actually
packed it that's why i'm a little more
pale this week I still impact on my
tanning stuff that's really gradual
really really gradual if you send me on
email I will late or if you search in my
videos you might be able to find it if
you want me to find that video for you
and where it is I will just send me an
email and I'll find it for you where I
talk about that product and see if
that's good for you the one that I use
before that was the two face it's like
hold was called tanning bed in a tube I
really like that one a lot that would
definitely has a warm tone to it and
they don't make it anymore so I'm not
really I don't have a lot of good self
tanning recommendations just because I
haven't put a lot of effort into trying
lots of things tantowel is a good one
you just have to make sure you get it
all over and it takes a long time to
well the other thing about tantowel is
that as the more you use that's how let
they're like these little tell let's do
I have one because I got one of my new
beauty test to let me see if I have one
here ah ok tans how so but tantowel you
get these little towelettes these little
packs yep and it says half body
application i use one of these for my
whole body but it's pushing it and the
more you use it it starts rolling up as
you use it like if that makes sense like
if you like imagine like a wet paper
towel that as you continue to do this
eventually it like rolls up on itself
and that's really annoying it does give
a really print ammo so if you're willing
to deal with the problems and it is it
isn't cheap either um that one's a nice
one but i wish i had more more
information if you have any really good
gradual self tanners for Nikki do at
Nikki and give her some suggestions
please Jenna I'm thinking about getting
the champagne pot for my birthday whole
next month if it's still available yeah
I hope so too i hope that it's it's
available to because i know that it is
limited edition and they do have limited
quantities so I'm crossing my fingers
for you Jenna Tyler I may save up money
for the hour glass pot because I keep
putting off getting and beyond my power
on the blush one so this may be perfect
for me yeah I think it would be perfect
for you I did get the blush one at one
point but I ended up returning it
because I didn't feel like it was worth
the price but I think with the blush in
with the highlighters I think it might
be worth it definitely let's see staff
so i might might as well cuz construct
an hourglass mega pot with both house
that i already owe and put them together
that's the route they're going to the
holiday palette it looks like it might
be it looks like they might be the exact
same ones that we may have already
bought and you brought the blush thought
I have a highlighter Paulo using you
have the highlighter palette it may be
you will have to look and see if they're
the same shades if they were smart they
would do different shades you'll say
we'll see what
opens a lot more people buying it Oh

I can't believe it maybe they're working
on it Theresa hello to you KJ wow that's
one big cup of coffee like no I have to
have a big cup of coffee KJ I was up
all night with this video i just need
eats my fault it's my fault because I
spent a lot of time packing and going
through boxes when I should have been
spending a little bit of time working on
the what to make a video and I just I
didn't and then I watched a couple
episodes of pretty little liars and the
cracks and I should have done that I had
to finish season 5 and I finally did I
had two episodes left and space
throughout the day I finally got through
it and now i'm watching season six on
ABC family i'm like addicted i didn't
get to see see the episode season 6
episode 1 though i was sad it was
already off of the ABC family app but
I'm like watching them in small small
pieces because I'm so busy with things i
only watch them for like five minutes at
a time and then i go do stuff and i
watch for five minutes as like my reward
for doing so anyway I'm so off topic oh
my gosh just like banging my head
against the wall shut up alright moving
on yes it is a big cup of coffee which
is very much needed and I think I'm
getting a refill after this ok let's see
Kim with just order the Kat Von D shade
+ light eye palette I've heard wonderful
things about that palette i do not own
it I own the contour palette I ended up
getting that and it's okay it's alright
oh let me show you what I got you guys
will get the first look at my birchbox
border I just ordered some stuff in the
birchbox shop I'm gonna go get my box
and i will show you and I'll be right
back I haven't even put on the app yet
i'm going to put on the app today
tomorrow I'm going to shoot a video for
the app soon maybe today and then I
don't know what it will probably
uploaded tomorrow for the app of what I
got the birchbox shop but you guys are
going to get to see it first of all
okay so i got i got all this from that I
gotta ask your opinion about this stuff
okay so let me show you the things I
don't think really you know they're just
want to show you this is the Smith and
Colts I got two of these nail polishes
these are what are the shades this is
Stockholm Syndrome and this is called
city of compton aren't these gorgeous oh
my gosh I'm wearing this one all my
nails today this one on the Stockholm
Syndrome they're not as bad as I thought
they were especially for $18 nail
polishes I just wanted to try them and
of course with nail polish I feel like I
have to get to because formulas can vary
within a brand and I looked up swashes I
tried to pick really good ones this one
was really solid two coats two to three
coats for this one I'm hoping this one
is a little bit better but we'll see so
I got those and then I got a steal of
liquid lipstick because i'm going to do
a liquid lipstick comparison video I
ordered some Anastasia ones and stomping
I ordered some Anastasio ones I got the
one in my Birchbox I got the little one
and then I just got this one this one is
an aria pretty little liars I have a
problem I I don't I'm I'm 37 years old
and I'm addicted to pretty little liars
but anyway here is aria I figured this
would be really nice for filming and
also a nice winter shade I mean just oh
so pretty I that's the first swatch I've
done of it it's just really really
pretty okay I need to wake that
somewhere I'll wipe it on the box oh my
goodness to see my finger okay this can
be mum hand all day thing it felt really
creamy and go on let me smell it smells
sugary it definitely has a scent has
like a sugary sent to it so I'm going to
compare these the Anasazi ones and the
Jacob UT ones that i cannot i have those
here the lipids they sent me a few weeks
forearm you 75 of them for review so
I've got I'm going to compare those and
then the
the colour-pop ones by the way I've
already got some questions on the video
as far as what I had on my lips in the
West would make a video this is bumble
by color pop that's what I'm wearing in
the what's of the makeup video this week
the sizes look comfortable looks like
stealing might be a little bit bigger as
far as size all have to do a size
comparison when I do the video so anyway
so I got this and then I got me
Anastasia contour kit I don't know why
do I need another con circuit no but it
was calling to me hi baby oh I love you
are you leaving thank you for coming and
giving me a kiss goodbye i have fun on
your bike ride no I'm not done we're so
in chat we're still there bye baby
hanging oh you smell some good I love
you hope your fun your bike ride okay
alright have fun on the ceiling bye
sweetie have a good time is daddy coming
into there's daddy love thank you for
taking the kids you're gonna have fun
love you okay all right text me when
you're coming home all right love you
okay so when you be back to this this is
the contour kit I have not even i
swatched like the tiniest little bit on
the corners but I didn't do full
swatches on this because I was trying to
wait it's hard to wait man okay one
thing I noticed about this that I didn't
realize is it's got the pans that pop
out I couldn't believe it i was
surprised let's do some little swatches
here of the Anastasia contour I know
this is not this is like so off topic of
what the questions are but I thought you
guys might want to see that let me
switch over to the view where I can see
myself so I can see what's going on here
let's see those don't look very
different they look very very similar i
mean in the pans they look different put
on my arm they don't look different i'll
have to try them on my face and see if
they look different on my face all right
here are the bronzer will contour shades
those definitely look different I don't
know one in three look kind of not too
much different hmm interesting that's
one thing about getting from like
Birchbox instead of getting from sephora
is
harder to return things I don't know I
want to try it I'm gonna give it a
chance I just swapped and I'm not being
so judgy I have just I have to try it
because when you smash things that is
not necessarily a key to how things
perform on the face so I am curious to
try this but one thing I have to ask
your opinion about because I am so
curious what you guys think tati from
lamb like guru is a channel that I watch
a lot she recommended this japonesque
face brush okay I forget how much this
is but it's like thirty dollars or
something crazy so this is what it's
supposed to look like all right but look
at what it looks like we pull this out
is there something wrong with my brush
does anybody on this thing look at this
look at that does that look the same
that is not the same there was the point
it's like they chop the point off that
is not the same brought all right am I
going crazy so I'm going to contact
Birchbox they like look I don't know
what is going on with this brush but it
does not look like the same shape and
takis brush looks like this so I don't
know if like something happened in
manufacturing or something but i am not
happy with the way that that looks
because the whole point of this brush is
for contouring to have that point it is
very soft it's not super dense I don't
know the bristles go down pretty far the
tapir goes down pretty far which will
probably be a very good thing but it's
just not the shape that it's supposed to
be so I don't know I'm confused I have
to I'm gonna have to i'm going to take a
picture of it and i'm going to take a
picture of Tom fees and see if they look
you know it compare them all like on my
computer screen together to see if
they're the same I mean am I going crazy
here or is that not the same brush oh no
but anyway so that's why I just got from
the birchbox shop um and I'm excited
about I'm excited about everything
except for the brush because it's just
not what I expected it may be a fabulous
brush but it's not what I expected all
right also does anybody own any
japonesque brushes because I don't own
any so I'm wondering if they're good oh
my gosh that drive down super dark and
super mad holy moly
alright moving on to more questions I'll
probably stay on with an extra 15
minutes today because the fam is gone
and I don't feel like packing today I
have to pack up I have all these old
things that I have to UM that have to go
through i have all the box of length
right now is my middle school life so i
have i have all these like a old hard
rock heavy metal magazines like hit
Parader and all those magazines um that
I'm going through and throwing away all
kinds i mean poems and i wrote for boys
in the seventh grade I mean just
stupidness think a lot of throwing away
a lot of paper a lot of putting my
papers I wrote just dumb so that's what
I have to do today one of the things and
then I'm going to try to pack some this
stuff behind me alright moving home

up see if I can find some clips Emily
good morning what is your Instagram is
just jen lowes reviews I would love to
follow each other and keep in touch sure
it's a yes just Jen loves reviews one
word uh you don't know me got older I
remember captain kangaroo I remember
captain kangaroo but I was little for
Captain Kangaroo I
very little for Captain Hammer I don't
really actually remember watching
Captain Kangaroo but I know that I watch
my mother's told me that I watched it
when I was a kid Polly good morning I
see flurries here somebody says flory
good morning i miss flora kobe head
hello Louie if you're here hi Jocelyn
Cherie Joe good morning so happy three
move thank you Jocelyn so good to see
you my dear thank you for being here
Miss Emily 1988 hi jen thanks for always
being completely honest and reviews
you're just about the only people right
trust there are a lot of really great
people out there it's just a matter of
waiting for and finding them and i think
ii tell from me personally this is me
proportionally is how they how they talk
about products at the products that they
got for review and how they put it in
the video description like you'll notice
some people like kristen and karina
kaboom and who else who else does that a
lot of people will say right at the
beginning in the video i received this
product review but does not influence my
opinion bottle boss something like that
Kristen game is what I'm talking about
um people say right up in the video
which I really appreciate it saying
being separate from video which is
really what should be happening but in
the description sometimes it'll say
things like thank you just shown so
company for working with me on this
video like that's too vague for me that
I don't like that and a lower or when
people say in a video and I'm not saying
these people are bad or viewers I'm not
saying these people are people that are
dishonest I'm not saying that at all but
for me like i don't i don't like when
people put in the disclaimer about um
like they'll say um products from this
in this video we're purchased by me and
less otherwise stated I hate that I hate
it because I mean really it's a time
saver and I think that's why people put
that in there because you can put that
for every single video but it's not
helpful to the viewer at all so if you
are watching this and you put that in
your video um I would let you know you
might want to consider changing that um
and being a little more specific for the
videos that are either sponsored or or
products were sent to you for review not
because it's just it's just not clear
and I feel like people that are clear
with that I know I can I can trust one
hundred percent because they're being
upfront in the beginning that's just my
me personally but yes you are very very
welcome I that's just part of me and who
I am and that is not changing at all
there's no reason for it to change it's
not going to change I mean companies
already don't send me stuff sometimes
because a guy lately I've been getting a
lot of a lot of requests for sponsored
videos but then I tell them what the
deal is and then I never hear from them
again and that's okay that's fine I
would I am not compromising like there's
no way there's no way I'm compromising
because you guys watching and your trust
of me is so much more important than the
money that they're going to pay me is so
much more important because in the long
run that is what's going to you know
keep people watching my channel is that
you guys can trust me and that that is
the most important thing to me is that
you guys can trust me so that's not
going anywhere really long answer okay
um alright Jay starr fam Z Jen I'm new
with makeup if dr. don't use it much
makeup at all when I shadow palette
would you recommend for beginner also
have you tried any Laura Mercier
foundations okay so let's start with the
eyeshadow palette thing what is your
budget if you are going for high-end I
always recommend i personally love the
naked to the original naked is also
recommends i would say hold off on the
naked 3 i would say pick which ever
naked palette close to you one or two
look at your undertone or ask the people
in store what your undertone is cool
undertones well like this one better
warm undertones room like the one better
i definitely recommend that if you're
looking for a more high-end if you're
looking for drug store the let's say
drugstore the elf immediate nude palette
is phenomenal absolutely phenomenal also
the lorialla pilot one excuse me
depending on your skin tone l'oreal the
palette 14 light to medium and then the
lapel it's you from medium to deep skin
tones let's see what else the wet mop
comfort zone palette is another good one
I don't feel like this one is quite
where is it where are you baby if you're
buried there you are the wet and wild
comes
somehow I feel like this one is good but
it's not quite as easy to use as some of
the other ones but it's very accessible
you know and it also gives you the guide
of brow bone eyelid crease and definer
which is nice you can mix these up you
don't have to stick to one side or the
other so would recommend this one oh
it's very easy to work with the reason
why I'm recommending all of these
specifically is because they're very
easy to work with and fergie dinners you
need a path it's going to blend really
easily not blend away and it's not going
to be too pigmented so that it doesn't
budge when you try to blend it so those
are definitely some recommendations
they're also more harshly found
solutions trying to think I don't know
if I have time or more sneaked out
nations I tried their / BB cream but not
foundation I don't believe okay actually
just a butt shot a bunch of decluttering
videos and I seriously I did good I did
good of many cluttering videos but i
don't think i have any laura mercier
foundations but if anybody has any
recommendations for laura mercier
foundations at JSTOR for her so thank
you for your question my dear I'm so
happy that you are here Marlene romper
room pissed me off that you never said
my name llamame me slap girl red eye she
didn't say my name either because
Jennifer was a relatively new popular
name so I don't think she ever said my
name either my mom's name was Rana is
Ron and Sam was my mom's name is rana
and her name is never owned anything
Lila gets upset because her name's never
on anything I think she would have said
Marlene though Arlene is not an uncommon
name um but yeah that's funny I almost
slipped you almost got me girlfriend all
right you don't know me I used to watch
The Mickey Mouse Club to you know I
don't Mickey Mouse Club is definitely
going back I used to watch what was it
one
on Nickelodeon when I went over to my
grandma's house we didn't have cable we
had a lot of money growing up we didn't
have cable my grandma had cable and it
was a show the one that had um Britney
Spears on it when she was young and
Justin Timberlake I used to try to watch
that over in her house I love that show
but I can't remember what it was called
you guys probably know what that was
called but I like that show Kids
Incorporated Kids Incorporated is that
what that was anyway whether that was a
justin timberlake one or not Kids
Incorporated was the one that I used to
love yes movin on movin on that and you
can't do that on television I was
addicted to that show whenever I went
over my grandma's I Chris the test
freckle LOL by the way thank you for the
suggestion on the city calling products
love them yay lily is in Texas and she
went to like 35 below is to try to get
some more city color products they
really are bad the cheek products this
is the only ones i vouched where's the
cheap products a couple years a year ago
a year ago so I got some of the other
city color products and I was not a fan
of the other things the foundation the
lip products the eyeshadows was not a
fan cheek products though fab and that
contour palette is fourteen dollars on
the city color website it's five bucks
at five below if you have a five below
near you I don't know I spy below was
only an East Coast thing but um but yeah
I'm so glad you like them Krista that
makes me happy alright let's see staff
I'm lucky have more than one test
freckle the only gem would be taking
more time off from YouTube while you're
moving I know what's up at makeup is a
lot of work no I'm not going to take any
time off I have a lot of videos that
I've pre-recorded I have decluttering
videos I have a getting ready with me
from last week's what's at the makeup
that I'm in the middle of editing it was
a 40-minute raw video so I've been
shopping it down slowly because when
you're getting ready like you know I
don't need the whole time I'm applying
the makeup you know so i have to chop
out like spaces and things so i'm about
halfway through that so that should be
up next and then what else do i have
recorded just a bunch of decluttering
videos that's probably what's going to
go up this week but you guys probably
won't notice that i'm gone
but what's the makeup does take a lot of
work but I I'm good will be good will be
good i don't think i'm going to be
taking any breaks I think I'll be fine
it's this it's the work thing that kills
me because that's that takes him a time
um but yeah off for the summer it's so
nice not to have to grade papers all of
them is so nice i miss my students
though they are my heart i love my
students but i do not miss grading
papers all right let's see cam I was
talking to shannon okay let's say home a

episodes oh you gotta do what you gotta
do an end of season five I was like oh

best episode I think ever the last
episode of season five maybe not ever
but definitely cause one of the biggest
emotional reactions in me from Pretty
Little Liars on the last episode of
season five I just went oh my gosh like
you blew it like I seriously it was like
roller coaster ride in that episode
those writers are good they're really
good there's a reason why I read
yesterday that that is the
longest-running show on the in the
history of ABC family for good reason
it's a fantastic show uh let's see um

good drugstore concealer that does not
are the one that I use and it does not
priests for me but I don't have a lot of
lines under my eyes so I don't know

the Maybelline instant age rewind this
is the dark circle eraser I really like
this one a lot it doesn't freeze on me I

the same page here Lauren I'm so curious
about the opal lipstick and lipgloss
bye-bye beauty you mentioned doesn't
that look crazy I would be marking my
curious about the lip gloss this is from
the what's up and makeup show today the
lip gloss I am more interested in the
lipstick I think if the lipstick is
opaque that would freak me out eggs like
that whitish lip No thank you but if
that lip gloss would might be a really
nice topper over other lipsticks like if
I did this and then put that opal over
top that might be really cool looking so
I'm really curious about that too
totally with you Nikki OMG Smith and

mom addicted to pretty little liars
since the first episode there back there
back in 2011 I've watched on netflix and
then occasionally on the ABC Family app
which is where i'm watching season six
Louise says she watches Pretty Little
Liars to see I think of it as being like
a teen show but I feel like they're
really incorporating like Hanna's mom
and some of the other moms and things
that makes me feel a little bit more
like you know like it's not
inappropriate for me to watch all these
teenagers making out boys and stuff you
know what I really hmm the writing is
fabulous um let's see Oh Mike this is
what my kids came in and gave me kisses
habana miss Lanie says they're so cute
how these acuity too I need to put up
what I really need to do what I need to
work on is I wanted to do and I haven't
done it yet a little video for our
anniversary Jonna are coming up on our
10-year wedding anniversary and I would
love to do like a little video in
tribute to him but I haven't done it yet

run into it while he's been packing but
it might be packed the wedding video hmm

you um let's see I actually side just
now when you show
the contour kit OMG gorgeous I know I'm
excited about the Anastasia contact ID
is joining us I got this from from the
Birchbox shop and I am NOT super
impressed with the highlight shades from
swatching them have them here but the
brown the contour shades look fab I'm
definitely gonna have to try them though
I can't judge it's completely just and
swatches I mean everybody knows not
everybody but but really we all kind of
know that you know when you swatch
something it's not the same as when it
performs in the face so some i'm curious
to actually try it it won't be today i
don't think i'm gonna put makeup on
today alright Jay star Oh real I really
want to try the beauty blenders well
beauty blender is fab but yet you can
get the real technique ones i feel like
the Real Techniques one is just as good
I don't feel like that last quite as
long I feel like a Gunks up faster but
really she changing those out anyway but
for you know a third of the price i
would get the real technique one if you
can I don't know what you can get in
australia though as far as as far as the
Real Techniques Beauty Blender ish thing
the one it's like peachy color Lawrence
we were talking about this boss I see I
wish we could talk at the same time that
it looks like this in the on the box if
you're just joining us I'm just trying
to fill you in and then this is what it
looks like in the packaging like how in
the world is not the same it's not the
same there's no way that's the same not
the same whoa weird okay uh let's see
lily I hated the Anastasia contour
palette horrible toughen up with a
horrible customer service i got from
anastasia website oh no well we'll have
to see i have heard bad things about
their on their customer service honest
hacia but i ordered from the birch bark
shop so i didn't have to deal with that
i did get the liquid lipsticks from the
Anasazi website and I haven't gotten
them yet I did get a shipping
confirmation though Jay started any when
you Sigma brushes thoughts I don't own
any Sigma brushes so i can't speak to
that at j star if you have quite
comments about Sigma Sigma brushes Susan
w that is not the same shape rush I know
right I know anything is is tates brush
tella these brush looks like this
I think I might just be something wrong
with mine I'm gonna take a picture of
incentive to berks barking ugh look is
this right because it does not seem
right they're really good with their
customer service at Birchbox I'm sure
they'll help me out nikki says I'm
drying dying trial Darach contour
palette Joel ever needed a review that
wasn't sponsored and he even said he
really doesn't care for lorac and he
gave it a great review it's on my list I
trust Jordan Liberty I'm that Jordan
liberty and I max um and I yeah a dime
ads and then we hung out at the Knicks
after party that man is awesome like if
you want someone that's down to earth
and fabulous Jordan liberty I will like
I will support him forever unless he
does something like crazy where I can't
support him anymore but as far as if he
continues being the awesome person that
he is oh my gosh I love Jordan Liberty I
love that man he is so funny and so down
earth-like did not treat anybody like he
was above them like was dancing with
everybody just having a good time just
really a nice nice guy and he's kind of
good looking till I have to admit his
comp good looking even John was tell me
he thought he was kind of good-looking
now don't jump to conclusions now but
you know we all talk we talk about these
kinds of things you know Jonathan but
he's a good-looking dude Jordan liberty
and he's very talented he's a
professional makeup artist if you don't
know he is fab absolutely fab at his

Liberty on Instagram he's got some great
videos on Instagram that just make me
smile he puts little clips of him
dancing with models and lip syncing to
songs and it just it always makes me
smile I love Jordan Liberty love him so
if he likes the lorac of pallet then i
would definitely trust that review I
steph says they're totally not the same
you're not going crazy true beauty I
came over from your new what's up in
makeup news and it's a random question
but what are your favorite MAC lipsticks
and your kids are so cute thank you so
much I don't own a lot of your lipsticks
ones I've seen out I have a few more but
not too many this is naked Paris and I
really like that one a lot and then this
one here I don't use a ton but I do like
this is Viva Glam for this one is more
wintertime what I love using that in the
winter like that one a lot I'd actually
ordered Viva Glam five and got four
instead I'm going to trade on me Deb I
believe and then I'm not sure if I have
other ones i think i do out i packed
away a lot of things but those are the
two did I have no I don't want online
map lipsticks to be completely honest um
I do like them I just haven't invested
in very many if anyone has mac lipstick
suggestions you are going to at true
beauty all right it is 11 0 7 i'm going
to get out of here at eleven-fifteen
show that i can start working on packing
up the rest of my house all right
Marlene I have to ask because I know
I'll never see it again one of on the
headboard under the glass dome I know
it's probably a wedding bouquet but on
the camera it looks like consola yeah it
is that was my bouquet for my wedding
that's up there it looks weird I know
but I miss my bouquet we were going to
get a professionally dry but they were
going to charge me like three hundred
dollars or some ridiculous having
freshly dried so my mom dried it for me
while I was in webs on my honeymoon wish
I hadn't been so expensive because
that's stuck in that like thing and it's
all squished and you know it is what it
is but yes it is my wedding okay so
funny and you probably won't ever see it
again it won't be in the background of
future videos that was a good guess
Marlene jaser seems like you guys like
the Beauty Blender might have to give it
a go it is what is wonderful indicating
one Jenny angle of the picture is
different as well oh you talk about the
yeah but it's pretty they want to turn
it like it's not like no matter what
angle i put this thing at it doesn't it
doesn't have that point you know what
I'm saying like it looks very ordinary
where this looks different Oh
all right Nicky says I wanted a bh
anastasia beverly hills but now i'm sold
on the lorac contour it comes with a
brush yep yep yep see now I'm thinking I
should I got in the lorac one instead of
the Anastasia 10 well nikki says it's
not the same brush Emily says I have one
japonesque i shadow brush and i love it
good to know Tyler me to Nicky wanting
the lorac contour to probably don't need
it girlfriend we don't need any of this
stuff but it is fun to get it there's
lots of things that I feel like in my
heart I need though really and truly Oh
yodeling Jody I knew you had a different
name jody jody jody jody jody jody jody
got it okay so jodha i gotta get the
jodha and then I linked it with the Jodi
I was asking her what her her first name
was I knew it wasn't yodeling Jen I
think make a peak is still having their
sale interesting contour brush kind of a
dupe for NARS I i have seen a noise
barks that's similar to that um but
that's good to go and make a peak is
still having their sale and this that
one there were some people that I'm
submitted some things though what's up
and make up app that i missed because i
spaced and it wasn't because they
weren't good things it was because I
just spaced and somehow they just didn't
get it in to get into the script and I
don't know what happened i was editing
the video and was like you know my
business and I missed that I missed that
I just got it I got to get a better
system now that people are submitting
things on the app for what's at the
makeup it's gotten a lot more difficult
to keep it working on so I'm working on
it let me say me says you think the
contour thing is just a bad yes I do I I
give it till the end of winter I think
next spring summer it'll be fading out
that's my prediction as far as a contour
thing Jenna gay or named Nicole of each
interviewed you nee Nicole so hard to
get rid of all that stuff Jen I have a
box of that stuff see this has been a
while since we had this conversation get

whether you've gotten a product for
review Jessica tough call Thank You
Jessica she just said that's why we love
you in the kidney what Jen
gossmakeupartist says think straight up

that man love em Tribune eji comment on
these chats oh hello hello just wanting
what is your favorite drugstore a
contour product uh right well I like the
elf one that just came out is fabulous
also the city color one is fabulous let
me show you I don't know where you live
in the u.s. months oh did I pack them i
hope i didn't pack them I packed so much
stuff it's really hard to find things in
here because I stuff I don't waste time
looking for them but I just did a 55
best products under five dollars video
and you can see the city color palette
in that one and then just skip ahead to
when you see it you can scrub ahead to
find it and then me elf I to the elf
review where you can see the elf contour
palette I think that the elf one is only
online the city color one you can get a
5 below if you're on east coast if not
you can get on silica city car website
but it's like 14 bucks in the city color
website but those two are definitely
awesome definitely worth the purchase
let's see you don't know me Jenn you go
girl thank you okay uh let's see Rachel

more a matte lip creams I have not I
wonder if they have that strong like a
watermelon II kind of smell like the
other lipsticks they probably do Lucinda

Lauren I'm new to make up to i have the
lorac Pro palette being shipped to me in
the mail it's $42 i have heard wonderful
things about the lorac Pro that would be
definitely a good starter palette I've
heard good things about I can't vouch

happy that you're here misty Lord and
watched Rugrats oh my goodness a trooper
babysitting and the kids had babysat
watch rugrats there's a generation
difference between us Lauren that's okay

Club we can watch Mickey Mouse Club
whatever girlfriend maybe the newer one
you're my age girlfriend alright let's
see steph says i'm weird i don't care if
you love sports videos but i do care
when their opinions are forced to not
genuine yeah see that's the point that's
the heart behind it I get you need to
sell the product but don't fake it yes
that's what I'm talking about I'm
totally with you totally with you I
don't think you're weird I think that's
what most people feel they just want
people to just be like hey dude this is

truly think doesn't just be upfront
about it because it looks shady when
people are aren't up front
drives me nuts sorry three more minutes
