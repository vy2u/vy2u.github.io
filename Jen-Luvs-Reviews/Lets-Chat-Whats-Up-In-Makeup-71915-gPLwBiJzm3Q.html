I'm so excited you like don't you know
what come ladies and gentlemen the only
thing i don't like about this room is
it's not very homey you know like i
haven't it's very empty in here so i'm
hoping that it's a model i'm hoping that
you all will help me fill this room with
love this morning because I'm feeling a
little echoey and alone in this room
this morning so let's go ahead and bump
over to the chat so i can see who is
here and we can hang out and i'm looking
forward to it I've been looking forward
to this all week all right let me see if
I can get there hold on a minute get in
there get in there what is going on here
new tab I gotta pause my voice BAM chat
window loading yeah look at all the
wonderful people oh I'm so glad to see
you all here this morning good morning
Sandra you are the first one here Sandra
good morning to Leanne good morning
Lanie not a gold digger good morning my
dear lady let me says someone drank all
the coffee Lainey oh no look you can
have some wine I'll make you some come
on over hang out hi Tyler good morning I
moved it go well thank you very much it
went so smoothly like so smoothly it was
just crazy we ended up breaking down in
hiring movers and it was like the best
decision we ever made like it was
amazing it was amazing it is fab except
for they broke one of our dining room
chairs I live in that everything was fab
so yes yes it went very smoothly thank
you so much Tyler dances with beauty how
long so good to see you where you can
actually type is she says this is the
first time she's in chat with a computer
and not on a mobile device so glad out
of here Jenny good morning yes I'm sorry
to Lanie about the coffee too oh let's
see Tyler Jen I have a
blush application question I may just be
way behind on the trend but when do we
stop putting blush on the apples of her
cheeks I've tried it and I think it
looked off on me yeah I don't know when
that stopped but yeah we don't we don't
really see people putting blush here
anymore I think it's because of the
clown thing because blushes are so
insanely pigmented these days like
really pigmented oh you know what I
forgot to do I just realized I forgot to
plug in my microphone I really wanted to
do that I think I'm going to do that but
I would've finished answering this
question first um I think it's just like
the whole clown thing so what I do is I
start at the back like bronzer like I
start the back because I figure if it's
really bright and it's I'm back to be
able to see as much and I blend forward
if I just did that getting ready with me
video um and sometimes I end up with too
much so I just go like this in my hands
I just rub it I mean it you gotta do
what you gotta do and you know like
really and truly you telling me that
some of these women that do these fancy
videos don't look like this sometimes to
get some of the product off I don't
believe it so anyway um sometimes I'll
go back to front sometimes I'll go front
to back but I usually try to stop like
middle of my eye and go back that's kind
of like my my stopping point is middle
of my eyeball all right so why make
amends I'm gonna find my minor photo
really quickly and then a powerful this
morning I am doing good I my white
battery out of there um I have all these
boxes on I started unpacking my
makeup that kind of wasn't top priority
i don't know if you guys can see me life
switch over so I can see what you guys
can see so really want to get my
microphone needs in the colony with my
this is my chair that same on for wed to

like I got company and I'm like doing
stuff that I should be doing hold on

loyal so Jake at beauty being it also
really makes me happy like they just

know like it makes it sound like they're
like bribing me with stuff to say nice
things but people have talked over there

really good products like there's been a
couple of things that I don't like so
far than they said I'm really excited
about my stuff let me show you this this
eyeshadow trio is not good um but these
really are like these are awesome just
don't get the blue on the blue ones
terrible it's nothing that's in but
these three are really good

a fan of from swatching I haven't had a
chance to travel i hadn't where a lot of
makeup for moving and everything so um I
have a husband and the dog are running
by the room don't fall down the steps
we're not used to having steps we have a
34 house now instead of a one floor
house and I'm hearing people running on
the stuffs and I felt there in full um
I'm really excited for Jake at beauty
and I really hope that they do well at
Ulta you know they've just have really
high quality products I'm excited about

really good Kat Von D products look
amazing um curious to see what's going
to happen with the man emu a collab with
a droid cosmetics and here's to see how
that's going to go after the drama that
was surrounding them I'm assuming it's
going to go great people have short
memories for things like that i think so
i think it's going to go great but um
but yeah those are some things i'm
really excited about Leanne am I the
only one of my house at drinks I'm the
only one my house that drinks coffee my
keurig is great i have a caring to see

myself when Mac made the official
announcement I was taking my son was
like oh my gosh I could have had that in

exactly the same so I'm going to do this
one eggs giveaway at some points um yeah

fantastic Oh throw that up there okay

specify that should be on they fall off
when I'm really skinny dude did it feel
good or fall off you this shirt looks
great on you though if the pants are
uncomfortable just try to trade off the
pants but the shirt looks great it's
just whether you're comfortable or not
okay buddy okay you do look cool bud and
the jcat beauty ones honestly you're fat
man they're absolutely fab I know I keep
talking about myself I'm sponsor I swear
not sponsored I swear I am not sponsored
they do not pay me any money they just

them good i can't help it and i don't
use a whole lot of lip liner so i have a
support one that I really like and I
like my Jake fut ones those are really

could get to it all the time now you
know what's dangerous about where I live
now I live really close to an Alta and
I'm not far from Sephora either it's
it's very dangerous i'm actually not far
from a nordstrom rack either it's crazy
I'm like in the heart of so much good
shopping I need to like lock my door and
not let myself out uh honey BMP good
morning for glad to have you here this
is her first um loving me out Melissa
lane on the app I have seen you on there
so good to see you here Melissa um glad
that you are here let's see Amelia I'm
still boycotting Manny and Gerard
cosmetics I think that people just have
to make their own choices about that
yeah mmm not going to go there Maggie
Chen make negi in the house half asleep
and just decided to try contouring why
not of course from what you know and you
know so much which palette honestly I
just got the Anastasia one once told you
I just got that one of my favorite one
so far honestly is the elf one I really
like the off one I had the Anasazi want
to add the kat von d 1 I had Smashbox
one I think the Smashbox the smash back
one in the elf one are so close in
quality I would say the elf one just
because of the price I mean the staying
power is the same it's the same
uh the elf one is fabulous to be honest
with you i love the elf one so i would
go with that one and then as you're
starting one thing that i had to learn
the hard way is definitely less is more
when you're first starting like do what
I what I did it was wrong was I started
with a heavy contour and I should have
started with a light contour and just
kind of built it up until I felt
comfortable I'm still working on it i'm
still not great at it I'm stupid I'm
still practicing Kim Easterwood good
morning from Ohio good morning to you
they won't talk to me until I've had my
coffee maybe your family I guess awesome
um let's see on a con ESC good morning
to you rusty pastel hey can you please
recommend some liquid lipstick on the
cheaper side the jcat beauty ones i know
i keep talking about them i feel bad i
feel like i'm sounding sponsored and i
hate that but I love my Jake a beauty
liquid lipsticks and i love i really
like color pop ones the colour-pop ones
i've heard or not getting the best
reviews i really like them so far also
the knicks the the next one is not the
what do they call it intense butter
glosses the intense butter glosses those
are amazing they're a little more
accessible yeah those are really good
yeah those are the ones i would say are
the ones that are the most successful
that I like the best and then followed
by the ones that are less successful the
jcat beauty ones and the colour-pop ones
i don't see that big of a difference
between them to be completely honest
they're all pretty great let's see Ali
good morning to you so good to see you
finally got sunday off yet misty I
thought Celine the line was releasing
into 2016 yes that's what yes that's
true that's what the official
announcement said yes 2016 that's true I
don't know if I accidentally said
something else I don't know but 2016 you
are one hundred percent right let's see
uh Helen Helen I believe a trois
bedazzled Helen yes good morning glad
you could finally make it glad you are
here my dear let's say good morning to
em baby blue one two three three good to
see you staff I really hope they do
Selena justice because the past
Mac collections have been met as of late
I hope so too I think that there are so
many people that have wanted this
collection I think that they are going
to put a lot of love into it I hope they
do um Kayla so did Milani switch to elf
no Milani didn't switch to elf um CBS
does not no longer carries Milani and L
they carry elf now so they've taken out
the Milan display and put in the elf
display in a lot of CBS's that's okay
thank you for asking i'm glad that you
asked the question if you're confused
definitely ask Maggie I'm also here
propped up in bleary-eyed because the
app because of the app and wanting to
see you home I saw your look on there
Maggie it looks really really nice
yesterday I've been mostly mostly on the
app hoarding things and not commenting
as much because I've been so busy and I
just want to look through so I've just
been liking everybody's pictures but I
haven't commented as much as I normally
do Boston Barbie doll good morning what
is good about the lash sensational I've
heard amazing things about it I really
like this lengthening volumizing no
flaking it's just a really just strong
mascara all those things you want in a
mascara for me this does I mean I don't
have sugar voluminous lashes on their
own I do have a natural curling my
lashes so i can't speak to that because
I don't need mascara too cold acryl in
my lashes but as far as um you know the
no clumping and the new flaking and the
lengthening in the volumizing sauce fab
it's just fab I would definitely
recommend it it's awesome one thing I
was thinking about doing that I think
would be really fun would be to like I
don't have a high ms air here but like
let's say this this is an and Coco but
let's say that this is a high I mascara
and this is a lash sensational do like a
video that's no sound right it's all
music not no sound but all music ok and
I show you the two mascaras right and
then I show you the application on both
eyes but I don't show you which one is
which like I will just show you what
they look like a bug eyes and see like a
Zach again you know like can you guess
which one is the drug storm which one's
the high-end you know I mean and then
reveal which one is which like make it
like a one-minute video of like a little
game I think that would be really fun
Oh to like you know do like close-ups up
my eyelashes or like an eyeshadow or
whatever that's like a dupe and see if
you guys can figure out which one is
which like just like a quick like one
minute video I don't know what you guys
think about that getting that will be
fun anyhow be fun because they love
little games like that like little
guessing games sometimes maybe it'll be
the high end one that really looks
awesome but I don't know I don't know I
think it'll be fun so that's something
I'm thinking about doing on the tray at
all but yes it is a fabulous mascara
Madeline good morning to you and let's

more thick where the jcat ones are a
little little wheelie ur not Whaley but
a little Willy er um let's see leann
good to see you too my dear Shannon Wow
all the regulars run a little late this

Nicole zard news and events reporter
went to bed way too late last night now
my green team agreed meeting again I
know I'm with you I want to bed way too
late last night too yesenia's anyway
tried to l'oreal lumi powders and cream
those things freak me out those Leumi
powders i don't know like I've seen I've
seen people for viewing him I don't know
I don't think I'm gonna get him I mmm
who was it wasn't Melissa Melissa Autry
I think I get confused what her last
name it's just like it keeps changing um
Melissa at rave reviewed them I think
she said that she wished that she got
the darker one of the halloumi the
l'oreal lumi powders I don't think I'm
gonna get him but yeah I don't know what
the cream is I know the pout oh yeah I
dunno what the cream is it's like in a
2d thing yeah there's any if anybody's
tried them at yesenia give her some um
give her some information about the
l'oreal lumi powders and cream stuff I
gotta go to CBS and see what they have I
hope they switch to elf I just I moved
away from alrighty I live used to live
right down the street from a Rite Aid
and a walgreens now I live close to a
CVS so that'll be an interesting switch
Lanie my walgreens still carries Milani
so wonder if they'll keep stalking it
Ali my CVS got rid of NYC which I'm
actually happy about the space is blank
though so I don't know what's going
there mm-hmm have to keep us posted Ali
uh m-maybe blue Jen do you have any lip
gloss recommendations I normally don't
you lip glosses but I just picked up the
bite beauty watercolor library so I'm
dying to get more the bite beauty lip
glosses are amazing now the question
would be is if you want pigmentation in
your lip gloss or you don't want
pigmentation
some products of the warmth of
pigmentation of our recommends are in
the next butter glosses those things are
fabulous and welcome all other clauses
like honestly look don't hate on me but
I actually really like the gyroid
cosmetics lip glosses I I'm speaking
only of the gloss I enjoy these glossen
here the the bomb ones are nice ones by
the ball these are really pigmented
these are more like liquid lipsticks
these are the mirror now swans these are
kind of expensive though this one is in
Maloney I just got this one off of the
Birchbox website not too long ago but
this one's more like a liquid lipstick I
really like that one a lot let's see and
I talked about the next soft matte lip
creams earlier let me more pigmented was
it goes really well said I fell in
lately because I'm yelling as much in
this room because there's too much of an
echo it's two out of four on the buxom
ones are found the laura mercier ones
are awesome what would be my
recommendation I'm not a big fan of this
this is the only NARS lip books that I
have and I'm not a big huge fan of it
it's just a weird it's a weird like
whitish pink it's weird however glass
makes really nice lip glosses as well
but its own boss I mean you die I
honestly I don't see much difference
between the drugstore ones and the high
end as far as with losses the only one I
would say I could tell the difference
and it's on high end and drug store is
this Kevin a quan one that i got from
that um it's not choi it looks like choi
but it's not trough is how you pronounce
it oh my gosh
oh my gosh there's something about this
the way that applies to my lips there's
something about it that just it
transforms my lips if I wasn't wearing
no makeup I which I only put it on but
this one is in blood roses and if i had
money like that i would get so many love
it I love it all right moving on taking
too long on that question I just love I
love lip glosses love it all right
moving on let's see Amy hey Jen can you
uh I think you're asking if I can make a
blog I am working on that i'm working on

sometimes they help me with filling in
that terrible isn't it terrible like
some words it's like wait a minute like

spell wrong like for whatever reason you
always call them wrong you know I so
help them with their spelling too for
the record but everyone small it there's

Kayla gen ending of recommendations for
a foundation brush up and using the elf
blending brush but looking to switch
this is the one I have all my brushes
put away but outer beauty I found these
brushes at imats they are very
reasonably priced let me go look and see
what their brush set is this these
brushes are fabulous and they are the
same quality as my it cosmetics brushes
I don't own any mac brushes and I don't
own any sin your brushes let me go to
outer beauty so I can tell you how much
that um so I can tell you how much that
kit is that I got face brushes let me
see there's a ok hold on a minute I just
have to find ok the kabuki brush this
brush is sixteen dollars which you know
it's a it's a it's a higher-end brush
but it's not like you know insanely
priced but this brush is fabulous um
where's the set on that face brushes end
of each don't
individual ones i want the sets where
their sets I can't find it brush sets
there we go ok so the four-piece
immaculate synthetic kabuki set is $52
you get four brushes which i think is a
really really good deal for how high
qualities are it's just outer beauty
cosmetics calm these things are fabulous
they have a bunch of different sets but
I really let the one that I have is a
four-piece immaculate synthetic kabuki
set fabulous but really what you're
looking for when you're in the store is
you're looking for this density and a
foundation brush I really like the ones
that are the flak buc-ee's also the ones
that are rounded I don't have to be out
right now all my brushes are packed but
but you want to look for this density it
whether flat or rounded look for this
density but I love this brush that's the
one I kept out for foundation that's
what I use um let's say anybody else
have any suggestions for um for kala ka
I LA for recommendations for foundation
brushes Monica's like yeah I don't know
what you're responding to but yeah back
at you the app is great what a positive
for the women thank you so much and now
I'm trying to remember what your name is
a starts with an M Marlene I can't
remember I you said to me earlier off to
go back everyone this video and look at
it earlier to see what your name was it
totally slipped out of my head I know it
starts with an M know you're on the app
though and you said you're on the app as
and I forget it went on my head I'm
sorry I'll look back those today I know
for next time um carbon orthos hanker
handcuff him to your makeup room John to
get him to stay in film a video with me
I know right uh and then uh Amelia says
haha nail him down to film I know right
um Elliot says all I put up as a store
name i'm not sure what what you're
referring to i'm sure it made sense in
context let's see on Akane i miss a live
chat last week but I wasn't
but it wasn't because I didn't try it
just didn't show and then two days later
I saw the chat and what's up and make a
video by looking you up oh that's so
weird so I just didn't show up in your
feed oh I'm sorry um I'm gonna come as
please don't paint your walls think I
can't we're renting they're gonna be
white they're gonna be why I can't we're
renting the house so I can't paint the
walls they're gonna be white but I would
paint them pink anyway Jenny anyone had
any experience with perfect formula nail
products yes yes yes I use the pink one
I got it was a hundred point pockets
before and I love it it's fabulous I
haven't been using it and my nails are
like chipping like crazy I need to go
back to using it because I really really
like it a lot definite recommend at
least for my nails they really work to
know nails or such an individual things

will work but it definitely worked for
me Jenny highly recommends and Ned good

i'm back with roni hello brownie I don't
go similar to this morning good morning
my dear oh let's say stuff like okay
thank you bye I'm sure that was from one
of the kids her wiener is talking about
dollar tree i'm not sure why i'm sure it
makes sense in context let's see Amelia
gin maybe in a few weeks I will in a few
weeks I'm not a seat it's like by the
time I get to your comments I have no
idea what we were talking about five
minutes ago I'm sure I'll go back and
I'll figure out what in the world you
were talking about there and thank you
all so much for using that app when
you're talking to each other that helps
me out so much Jan your daughter's so
much like mine so to you thank you so
much yeah she's a fun kid Jenny T is
talking to Sandra let's see Allen says
that if it has sixty percent off sale
people good time just snacks and goodies
got the perfume for 14 bucks is it nice
I tried to laugh with me Lili it was
very floral for me but i'm not sure if
they have other ones i think the lab
would really Lea's benefit i'm pretty
sure um let's see curving heard anyone
have a good suggestion for a perfume
similar to Dolce Gabbana's like blue
that was moon again it was a little too
floral for me so i don't have good
suggestions but if anybody has the
suggestions at curvy nerd she wants
something that's similar to dolce
gabbana light blue hey if you go on
onset birds website you can do
a little sad finder without subscribing
I think you might have to in order to
see results you might have to sign up
for their emails but they have a really
good scent finder over there you don't
have to sign up for this subscription in
order to use the scent finder but I
think you might have to sign up for
their emails but then you can always
just cancel it or whatever but but go
over there are and then look at dolce
gabbana light blue and see how they
describe it and then you can find sense
that are similar that's what i would
recommend i love that website it's such
a great website Amelia Jedi understand
but if you ever have a reason us
midwesterners will be very excited Oh at
Chicago yes I would love to go to
Chicago one day Jenny do you all see
that people I say I am NOT i'm on a no x
and i'm planning on a tsv purchase help
but so so do my nails oh she's going to
get a QV cts-v but she's on a no x it's
hard man when they have those tsps and
it's limited time and you got to jump on
there it's going to be gone that's how
they get you that's how they get you
well let's see I mean Lee Ann says oh
there's a 17 17 piece bag of ulta
products free with a six dollar online
order oh my goodness oh my goodness
that's how they get you that's how they
get you a as may hi Jen wanted to ask
you how would you deal with your little
girl asking if she can wear makeup at a
young age thank you um we do do play
makeup she does do play makeup I
honestly wouldn't have a problem with it
depending on what it was I started
wearing makeup very young I think I was
12 when I started wearing makeup 12 or
13 my mom sold Avon at the time and I
just wore like a little bit of lip gloss
when I was 13 I was wearing eyeliner um
I don't know how young is young but I
wouldn't have a problem with it to be
completely honest there was a little
girl in my fourth grade class last year
that war quite a bit of makeup um and I
think it is looked I don't know I mean
she she's just beautiful beautiful girl
I'm absolutely beautiful and I think it
was just something that she chose to do
that she really wanted to do i think
that the adults looked at her more kind
of like oh my goodness there's a fourth
grader wearing makeup more than the kids
did I think the kids kind of embraced
her
and didn't really see anything strange
about it so I don't think that it helped
her socially I think that it's one of
those things that is a self expression
thing and I feel people should be
allowed to express themselves in a way
that makes them feel comfortable and
happy as long as that's what's being
used for as long as the makeup isn't
being used to um I don't know two in the
wrong I will just say in in a way that's
negative that's that riled may feel like
they need makeup in order to look pretty
you know what I'm saying if it's done in
a way that it's seen as a self
expression i support that a lot more
than I need makeup in order to look
pretty you know what I'm saying so I
think it would just depend on the
motivation on Lila's motivation of
wanting to wear it um so I think I'm
going to have to see what I do when I
went when at the bridge comes you know
how I'm gonna cross it so that's the way
that I kind of feel about it I don't
know I don't know she's seven so I'm
hoping I have good five years at least
before she wants to wear makeup up those
we'll see though we'll say we'll see
what happens um let's see hopefully that

morning I used to wear makeup over eight
years ago before it became disabled by
my illness they've recently come out
with great by my illness by an illness
but they have recently come out with
great new medication to help me on would
like to start again well I am very
excited for you you know um if you want
you can download the west of the makeup
appt there's lots of wonderful ladies on
there with lots of fantastic suggestions
on products and things really truly the
people on there are amazing so I would
definitely recommend downloading the app
and that's not just cuz it's my app I
really is a fabulous place to meet
people especially people that are just
learning people that are just regular
everyday people trying out products it's
a fantastic place to be but yeah you're
in the right place we on I mean youtube
there's so many suggestions out there
for for makeup and for people starting
again with makeup and my suggestions to
you would just need to start with just
one thing depending on your your needs
so if you feel like maybe concealer is
something that you would want to start
with first if you have skin
discolorations or if you'd like your
eyes or your best feature start with
some so I line or some liquid eyeliner
start with a pen eyeliner pen eilers do
not do the pencil eyeliner starting off
the pen eyeliner or fab they're amazing
for your upper lashline all mazing so
easy to control so fabulous the old
liquid liners they will go on all you
know hard to put on where you know you
didn't know how much was on your brush
and they splatter everywhere but
pan liners are awesome or start with
some neutral eye shadows you know get
the wedding all comfort zone palette or
you know walking on eggshells or
something from wet and wild those are
fabulous eye shadow palettes um let's
see if your lips are your best feature
you know go for like oh my lips the
better shade for your lipstick you know
just something really subtle something
to kind of ease your way into a but I am
excited to have you here Julia and I
hope that you stick of ram I'm very
happy for you that you want to start
wearing some makeup again because it is
fun it's a loan of fun um let's see okay
up we got two minutes left let's see if
I can get okay Jenna has anybody seen
the out a new elf shadow palettes in the
stores I know I haven't Shannon don't
worry about sounding sponsored you want
a few people that I feel we can really
really trust to be honest so sponsor or
not I know you'll tell the truth i know
and i would tell you like if they were
paying me money I would tell you but
they don't pay me money like I've gotten
money from like one maybe two people i
think that fit fun um gave me money to
promote their water bottle i have a
couple of companies they want to pay me
for certain things but i will tell you
when it is like i'll be like all right
they gave you know it will say sponsor
video like a high up on the description
and i'll mention it in the video so you
guys know but you know i would say if
you're wondering about Jake a beauty you
find one product that you like spend the
two dollars five dollars or whatever on
the one product and tested for yourself
and see whether you agree or not and if
you do then get more you know i would
rather people do that then trust me
wholeheartedly buy it you know fifty
dollars with stuff and then end up not
liking things but i honestly think that
you'll like it i really really really
really do um thank you though Shannon
that really means a lot to me like a
whole lot alright 1109 I boss the
barbell Jen by the way my name is
Jessica good to know Boston Barbie doll
is Jessica Jessica Jessica Jessica
Jessica Jessica okay Jane Jane good
morning i'm wondering if you happen to
use sheet massive so do you get them
from subscriptions or elsewhere i
personally do not like sheet masks it
grossed me out there too slimy and they
gross me out but i do know i don't get
them I don't I did get a an influence or
box box with some Freeman beauty masks
and actually kind of enjoyed those
bet those were kind of fun but I I don't
like Sheamus like they gross me out like
i usually give unto my friend Mary Lynn
who loves them but really all this all
in the mass I've ever gotten I've gotten
from subscription boxes because I just
don't Monica was saying she loves the
idea for the video so I am i doing like
a duke game like you know like taking
two mascaras like a drugstore and a high
end and like putting them on my lashes
and doing little close up and saying you
know one of these is drugs for one of
these is high-end which ones which and
then like they had to be like a
one-minute video might do a reveal of
which one is which like then showed the
application of them going on like I
think it would be fun so that's an idea
i haven't shot any of them and i don't
know if i will but that was just my di
had like we're still working on the
podcast they talked about my friend and
I were working on doing a blog I mean
there's so many things in the works I
don't know what's actually going to come
to fruition is just smoke I don't know
um okay it is 1111 um Monica says I like
music videos more for product reviews
than tutorials oh really interesting
that's good to know hmm okay all right
let's see Julianne we're going to do
this last one julienne just got the in
app installed I see an appt appt
addiction situation coming on i'm
probably going to annoy fellow
subscribers if I an incessant product
those it won't be annoying because
that's what we all love we want you
everybody wants people to post a lot of
stuff please post post lots of things um
all right we'll do one more will do one
more Kim Easterwood hey honey any tip on
10 gram I should wear on safan someone
hooded eyes problem as I by any and all
palates out there start with going for
some Matt's girlfriend get some matte
eyeshadows are your friends I'm telling
you mad eyeshadows and doing that
contrast so that doesn't end up looking
muddy like I remember my grandma she
would wear a lot of with neutral brown
ganar lids and they ended up just kind
of mushing all together so start with a
color that's similar to your skin tone
all over your lid and then get on
we're at with all NAT and then get a
brown up in your crease I guess because
you have hooded lids you might not be
able to see but if you bring it up on
house yeah what it is I want to give you
advice I'm go to Melissa Melissa audrey
has hooded eyes so if you look at some
of her tutorials and how she does things
but then do it with matte shadows and
definitely get that contrast in there so
that you've got that lighter lid and
that deeper crease it will look good but
definitely stick with the mats and and
maybe do like a little inner corner
highlight with a little bit of shimmer
but don't go crazy on the shimmer
because that shower can really
accentuate this those lines and wrinkles
and things so don't do that um go for
some mats will look beautiful i'm
telling you I'm telling you girlfriend
all right uh I gotta get out of here I
gotta stop I'm gonna stop I gotta stop
all right I really appreciate you all
being here thank you so much for being
here your um guys are awesome you're
fabulous and hopefully next time you see
this room no actually it won't look so
cold and white put some pictures up or
something I have a couple of pictures i
just think i showed in the chat uh last
week I that I'm going to put up no more
boxes italy the boxes will be gone by
then so I thank you so much for watching
thank you for being here um I appreciate
your friendship I look forward to this
every week and I look forward to talking
with you again next week have a
wonderful week my friends and I'll see
you soon my love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
