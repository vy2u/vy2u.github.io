nikki says anyone following the NYX face
awards Awards I stopped following it I
don't know why I mean I think it's
interesting to see all of the the looks
of people are creating but for some
reason I just I don't know it just not
just stopped becoming a priority I don't
know I guess I don't really have anybody
to root for his patrick Star still in I
guess he would be the one I'm rooting
for because he's the only one that I
know but I feel like I wish that they
did it more like reality style TV style
kind where you know they did like little
clips of the people like introducing
themselves and you know like got to know
them a little bit so you could feel it
connected to the contestants I think
they'll be really cool way for them to
to kind of improve it for for the future
I don't know I just think it would be
cool to get to know people so I'd know
who to root for Amy good morning to you
my dear okay now Juliana's with us yay
oh I'm so glad very good good morning
cam the morning kathy the morning Jenni
yeah yeah I'm glad you made it back
Jenny I saw you Rover and the other one

says can't wait for the buxom holiday
lip said oh my gosh I know oh my
goodness that thing's crazy if you
haven't watched the slideshow yet today
I got um permission from cosmo for
latinas um Lily was kind enough to ask
her if I could use her images and she
said yes so we have some holiday images
in the slideshow this morning I had to
just slide show because little john's
birthday party was yesterday his
birthdays actually today but John's
taking into the gym so um because they
you know they like to go play at the gym
so that's where they're going this
morning and then I'm just staying here
to chat and to work on videos and um you
know do my fine so so yeah and then
we'll spend the rest of the day as a
family so this is kind of just like a
period of time where we won't be
together today and then we're going to
go do a bunch of stuff a little john for
his birthday he opened a bunch of
presence this morning that was pretty
cool but anyway um i am excited about
the buxom holiday lip said I think that
looks really cool i probably won't get
it but i think i was gonna get anything
will probably be the sephora favorites
they give me more lips at that thing
looks so amazing oh my good
let's say listen I was worried I was
worried too because there's like a
little light over by my my web camera
like little circle and the light was not
coming on I was like oh my gosh why
please come on I don't know what was
going on but anyway little morning
Krista's so good to see you my dear

thank you so much he opened up a lot of
presence this morning he's like super
excited Gina good morning to you Nikki
you have to watch glam and Gore's video
it's so good okay I will I will I will
watch it after the chats over Nikita
good morning my dear she says thank you
for letting know about the difficulties
decided to look at my twitter page and
saw your tweet yeah I get to be at the
live chapter at the beginning for the
first time yay so happy to have you here
Nikita Krista Jan I need some tips on
blending self tanner might by my ankles
and wrists always looks like i have
bright white hands and feet have you
tried using a beauty blender that's what
i do if i can't get it to look right and
it might just be your self tanner might
be the consistency of the self-tanner
that you're using um it's the the soft
tanning myths i'm not sure if you've
tried those but like i don't know i had
when i first started using self tanner i
had so many issues with it like there's
videos if you go way back there's videos
of like me with like this big like brown
stain on my arm like I didn't blend my
self tanner very well I'm also
exfoliating around those areas is really
important that might be it as well
making sure to exfoliate because those
areas can kind of get um you know extra
skin and things that don't kind of mess
up your tan a bit that's all I've been
doing this summer self tanning and it's
been working out pretty well I'm pretty
happy with it i've been using the st.
Tropez that spray stuff that smells
terrible but it works it works now that
I've built it up a bit now it works but
for a while wasn't it was it took a long
time to start building up but anyway
that would be my suggestion it's oh oh
wait wanna miss you said it looks like
um looks like you have bright white
hands and feet like your wrist that's
weird that's really weird I've talked
about I'm I'm sorry I'm sleepy um so I
don't know why like I could see like
here like cuz you gotta wash your hands
or whatever but you said your ankles and
wrists I don't know just blend make sure
you blend it down girlfriend blend it
down nerdling folk good morning my dear
let's try this again oh I know right
technical difficulties I know you know
about the technical difficulties can
happen my friend Kathy Jen do you have a
favorite shower gel no because I'm
constantly switching between samples and
things that i get actually you know I
used one by what is it Beauty protector
than what the brand that smells really
good that you get from the Birchbox
sells this beauty protector they had a
shower gel that i really like but really
for shower gel for me it's all about the
set and girlfriend so um I I was using a
lot of stuff from Bath and Body Works
but then I saw with there's lots and
lots of chemically stuff in there so I'm
trying not to use that stuff anymore
trying to use a little bit more natural
um products but most of the time
honestly I just end up picking out of
the drawer that have you saw my skincare
decluttering stuff I have so much stuff
so I just end up grabbing the next
little bottle and just throwing shÃ¡Ã¡ I
wish I had a better suggestion for you
Gabi did you see the in the show that
philosophy has that huge tsv the today's
special value of all of those body um
whatever which called like the body
steps or whatever the body shower gels
oh my gosh that's like the holy grail of
philosophy shower gels like I looked at
that picture and I was like what they
can't be selling all this together but
they are that's like three years worth
of shower gel haha Jessica good morning
do you know anything tom ford know some
pretty stuff a man kathleenlights would
say that's expensive it is expensively I
looked at that it was like eighty
dollars for the foundation was like you
kidding me like are they just making it
that price just so people can feel extra
fancy it's like the Christian Louboutin
or whatever
the nail polishes like they're fifty
dollars it's like why what could
possibly be in their goods that
expensive nothing it's all the novelty
of it I mean I'm sure that it's
phenomenal product may have heard
fantastic things about Tom Ford makeup
like that it really is out of this world
but I don't know what they're putting in
there that's some expensive magic dust
that's all I got to say about that no I
don't own anything I own like one Kevin
a quad I shadow duo and that's pretty
much it for like super high-end stuff
they have and the stuff that Lily sent
me Lily Spurgeon sent me some armani
stuff and a couple of Chanel things and
things her mother-in-law has a bunch of
that stuff and passes it to her and then
it doesn't work for her she passes it to
me so I have a couple of things from
there but no Tom Ford that's when we go
over to what's your name that I love um
that has a huge giant makeup collection
uh Tara Tara Tara Tara yes go over her
Channel Terran this Terrace whole
channel name I am so sleepy this morning
can you tell I can't even like I have to
look it up now because it's driving me
nuts oh I can't even find a tear all
right who am I talking about the girl
with the giant makeup collection hi
mamas I am office Tara baby seat my
husband knows my husband knows this is
sad this is sad when John knows the name
of a channel that I don't know I'm glad
you didn't leave yet he's was driving me
nuts and I couldn't figure it out how
does she know this how does he know this
the girl with all the toolboxes exactly
she's got the toolbox in the background
oh my gosh I'm embarrassed thank you
though I appreciate you that is
hilarious he knew that Tara babies
goodness gracious coffee hi coffee
please work please all right oh my gosh
oh my gosh that's embarrassing okay
anyway let's move on where was I had to
scroll it as if anybody was telling me
what it was
ah let's see nikki says oh I was so many
holiday sets that one with the 300 some
pieces i was chillin over there was
something oh wait there was the one
linked with 300 some peace pics oh yeah
the one the link that I put in the video
description that was from some big event
that Sephora had that showed like all of
the holiday makeup that's coming out so
there was somebody that I guess they
paid to go it looks like it's like a
paid place where they they take pic they
took pic professional pictures of all
the products and then you have to pay
for rights to use them so thankfully on
the woman over at cosmo for latinas let
me use her pictures i wouldn't pay in
$75 a picture to use those pictures by
the link if you go to that link there's
tons of pictures of that event with so
many pictures of so many cool things
there's a part set there's a a bite
beauty set over there like you can see
everything like totally recommend they
be huge watermarks over them and I of
course I don't I try not to use you know
anything that I'm not a hundred percent
sure is something I can use so um but
anyway yes Nikki I was drooling to Jenny
hey Jen did your neighbor finally take
care of all his trees yes they did
finish all of the trees over there I
actually moved from that house but yes
they did take care of those trees the
trees were rotting and like when they
cut down the trees you looked at the
base and it was like it was like this
much like the tree whole tree base was
like this and there was like this much
that was like still living on the
outside and everything else on the
inside was like rot and it was scary so
I'm so glad that they cut those trees
down but yeah we don't live there
anymore we still own the house but we
don't live there but yes they did finish
chopping down the trees Nikita happy
birthday little John thank you so much
my dear Sarah Jen good morning everyone
uh she's from Kansas City so many liquid
lipsticks out there to try which one
should I start with I tend to have dry
lips this is what you do girlfriend you
put on some lip balm and then you put on
your liquid lipstick and then as your
liquid lipstick starts fading through
the day put your lip balm on again it
kind of takes away a little bit of the
mat but regular people don't notice that
stuff where are the only ones that
notice that stuff like put on the lip
balm you'll be alright honestly
with the liquid lipsticks that I've
tried let me show you i'm working on a
liquid lipstick video right now so let
me show you these are the ones that i
have like out that i'm making sure to
try but i have um okay so I have these
these from Jake a beauty they just
started selling these at Ulta these
things are really nice if you can find a
shade that you like these are great I
think these are five bucks each for
dollars something like that the lipids
by Jacob beauty these were sent to me
for review so just so you know they were
sent me for who you but they're just as
good as everything else but honestly I
can't tell how much difference between
the formulas like I don't know if it's
just me or what but the colour-pop ones
are really good I think there are five
bucks each the Anasazi at once I don't
see any difference between these other
ones so far like I need to try them more
and then I have an LA girl 1 I have some
steel ones honestly I feel like they're
all kind of the same like I don't know
is anybody else feeling like that about
liquid lipsticks that they're kind of
the same other ones that I like a lot
but are really accessible if you can
find Shadid you like or the rim will
show off lip velvet those are really
nice and Nick the Knicks um NYX soft
matte lip creams are fabulous um you
know I mean they're shona formulas and I
honestly like I put one on I can't tell
which one I put on they're all they all
seem to be pretty much the same I do
need to wear the more though I hadn't
been wearing as much makeup since i'm
all for the summer so i need to make
sure i'm using them every day but
full-face makeup just hasn't been
happening lately so but go for the less
expensive ones because i've really been
loving them absolutely loving them
whichever one is the most accessible to
you i would say just go for it but yeah
but definitely use a lip balm definitely
on that come on yeah good morning did

of the I wanted to go up to a certain
price point so that i could get free
shipping or something like that so i got
a couple of the what are their
eyeshadows the foiled look and
eyeshadows oh my gosh my brain today i
swear i need to figure out a way to get
more sleep you know that video that i
put up with a slideshow girlfriend that
wasn't
much easier that was still hard it was
like nine minutes of torture trying to
gather prismatic shadows that's what
they're called I got some person attic
shadows but anyway that's what forever
couldn't believe how long that video
joke to me huge but next week I will be
able to film like regular and it'll be
fine it'll be better okay but any one
thing all right Jenny says jen i love
this jake at beauty lip stains and lip
paint so glad i found my channel meet
you i think i might like the lip itude
better than the lip paints just because
i think they're not as messy and i love
the applicators on these things let me
show you one that you might actually go
see the applicator the applicator is
kind of a hard plastic behind this
little soft squishy stuff it's kind of
um stiff so it's got like almost a point
to it here where it's like the hard
plastic so that makes it really easy to
detail around your lips and I really
like it a lot I really like these and
they're very minty scent it if you like
the buxom sent it doesn't have that on
that tingly feeling but it's got that
same scent that the buxom lip products
do so I don't like five bucks or
something oh gosh um again I got those
sent for me for promotion not promotion
for review totally different trying to
say for review because promotion to me
sounds like I'm going to promote their
product they sent this to me for review
specifically okay Kathy but I'm glad
that you like those jetty that's awesome
Kathy Jen love the decluttering videos
you did such a good job I was impressed
such a hard thing to especially those
blushes and I shows I no girlfriend I

sometimes alright bonita good morning my
dear okay let's say Jen from Julian or
anyone else may know how fast is the
allura beauty thrills ginormous bucks
sell out once it goes on sale give it
five minutes that thing's gonna be gone
five minutes tops like three minutes
that thing will be sold out like BAM
done gone like you better get on there
1201 if you want that box I was thinking
about getting this one I've never gotten
one before I now if you didn't don't
know the allure beauty thrills box is a
like a seasonal thing I think it's or
quarterly something like that where they
have a ton of mostly drugstore products
like full-size products for like really
really cheap it's $45 I believe and you
get a ton of stuff there's a picture of
it on the in the video for this week
but yeah if you go to the omni old war
website you should be able to find it
and it's yeah 1201 p.m. I might set my
alarm and try this time and if I get it
I get it if I don't I don't will say not
I need any more products but some stuff
in there look really really cool like
things that I really wanted to try so
we'll see all right Nikki overset I
think as one of the best for most for
liquid lipsticks they have a lot of
other nice stuff to that's true I agree
and I do really like their formula I'm
with you it's got a nice feeling to it
when you put it on jenna says I have
super dry lips and only found a few that
i love Jay Kat Kat Von D sephora

bit plasticky um and then this is

out of my mask and I have some other
ones I just kept forgetting to put them
in the new shower learn other mass likes
haven't been using them but thank you so
much for that heads up my dear oh let's
see people talking to me was talking to
me okay Amy Jen if you got my message
i'm not sure which message sweetie where
did you send it you send it on twitter
or did you I don't know where you put it
so probably not because I don't know
what you're talking about so probably
not Oh Nikita let me just say I just got
introduced to lush is expensive but it
does last or seems they will last the
products i own you know john at you know
John owns a tattoo studio and we used to
have a girl at work there as our counter
person and she worked at lush she was a
manager at lush full time and she used
to bring us all kinds of love stuff and
I just didn't appreciate her the way
that I should have when she works for us
because she used to bring us all this
stuff and I explained and then I went
into a lush and I was like oh my gosh I
things like twelve dollars for a little
tub of face scrub like more so um I
haven't bought anything there since then
actually no that's not true my family
has I haven't but what's a good stuff
there man and I love that it's all like
handmade and natural light natural
brilliant stuff like that so um but yeah
good stuff I'm willing to go back to a
lotion and explore a little bit more
Nikita let me just say I just got it oh
i just read though i just read that
Sarah Jen why are you torturing yourself
with this decluttering you have more
space now we all know that you're
collecting makeup isn't exactly rational
you should keep what you love pitch what
you don't but this is my logic is
because makeup goes bad you know like
after a while makeup is not good anymore
and I don't want to see like my color
tattoos right like most of them dried up
and went bad somebody else could have
used those and love those before I to
throw them away it's like Lulu you know
like there's certain things like
especially like the cream products and
things like that I'd much rather pass
them on I mean even eyeshadow after a
while goes bad so I'd rather pass them
along to somebody that can use them you
know I hear ya I hear ya area
but yeah I just I rather pass them along
with somebody you know they don't diddle
use them and get love on because you
know I'm gonna get more products so you
know but it was tortured did if we did
it upset you when I was upset because I
was upset alright but anyway yeah so
I've got more decluttering I gotta
declutter my lip products and that's
gonna be weird because you can only pass
on lip products like that's really hard
to do because bacteria you put on your
lips then you put it back in bacteria
all that stuff so I don't know what I'm
going to do as far as my lip products
we'll have to see after watching
decluttering lip products and see what
other people are doing with their lip
products that they declutter Liz any new
and up-and-coming youtubers I should
watch alright this is what I'm going to
do I'm going to go to my feed of my
subscriptions and I'm just going to read
you some names of some people that I
love there's a lot of people that I love

this one this one I got I think I got
this in ypsi though recently this is the

of dark though I think I might use it as
a um as a well I guess I could kind of
use it i don't know if i'll use that as
a highlighter i might use i'll probably
uses eyeshadow because it's kind of dark
for me but I guess I'll highlighter it's
kind of dark I don't know I guess right
now i can probably get away with it is I
later but my regular skin tone I don't
think that's gonna happen um but that's
awesome that's good to know because i
haven't seen like a shimmer brick thing
from them oh you know what i think that

glittery powder and then everybody else

with shimmer brick thing and I I wanted

bought a reddit YSL lipstick I don't
even know like I guess because I figured
I wear it like out on dates and for like
holidays and stuff but it's like why
wouldn't I spend it on a color them
actually gonna wear you know so I was a
little upset that I did that because
that's my only YSL lipstick I've went
like twice what a waste so next time I
buy an expensive lipstick well next time
i did i bought the marc jacobs one in a
shade that I actually we're um but I
don't know where it is I still haven't
unpacked everything I'm working on that
I had it right here because I used it
the other day and then I don't know what
I do that I think I stuck it in the bag
with all the rest of my lipsticks which
of course is m.i.a right now all right
anyway moving on but Christy I I'm going
to go look at the lipstick queen stuff
today I'm going to altos soon as we're
done here I'm getting dressed I'm going
ulta did you guys see my shirt by the
way look how funny the shirt is I
this when I was unpacking let me flip
over so I can see I'm gonna shirt ah in
that funny I forgot I even bought this
shirt this shirt is so old I was like oh
my god I'm wearing that in like five
years but it's like one of those little
paper like fortune tellers it's funny I
actually passed along a lot of the
shirts that like the little teeny tiny
shirts like this that I used to wear a
lot i gave a lot of them Delilah and now
she's wearing they're a little big on
her but they're cute but they're too
small for me like I used to wear shirts
that like Grey's like right at my pants
line like like where you like lift up
and you can actually see your belly a
little bit so those I pass along to her
I'm not wearing those ever done uh let's
see Tara was like yeah it's me i know
right you're bronzed look is awesome um
let's see okay Nikki I love them both oh
let's see what do you talk about Oh ulta
and sephora thank you for clarifying
Nikki could you know by the time I get
to these comments I don't even know what
we were talking about they both have
good and bad things about them I agree I
agree let's say Chrissy says good to
know lipstick queen has less expensive
options $25 I can do for a goody yeah
but still $25 from lipstick us for four
hundred dollars for four lipsticks like
I don't know about that haha feline que
je hi jen i know it's almost everybody
want to say hi hey i'm gonna stay on for
11 more minutes because i started late
oh let's see hopefully you're still here
ok florid gin or anyone else in is there
any way to join the community on the app
without having a facebook or twitter i
want to log in and post stuff but I
don't have any social media ok this is
what you do you go on facebook or
twitter and you create a dummy account
make it up name it after your favorite
comic book character or whatever you
know like it doesn't matter name it
after your cat alright just make some
kind of dummy Facebook or Twitter
account it doesn't matter what it is
don't put any pictures up on it just it
has to have a real sounding first name
and last name and then just link it to
that but the app creators will not let
me um there's they're not letting
it through like email or whatever so
there's nothing I can do about it
unfortunately you just got to create
like some kind of dummy account um you
know and then just just have it and just
be like they're only for the purpose of
signing it for the app because the app I
don't think wrecking like I don't think
it like links to your Facebook or
Twitter like I don't think it like it
doesn't do anything for my facebook or
twitter like it never posts on it and
never liked does anything weird with it
I don't know but yeah I'm sorry florid
but yeah see if I don't know how old you
are if there's a reason why like because
I don't not familiar with your user name
but like if your parents won't let you
do a Facebook or Twitter or whatever
maybe they'll let you create like a
dummy account or if you're an adult yeah
just create a dummy account um yeah
Christie's saying the same thing set up
a Twitter that you never used she never
uses hers yeah on Akane I Jen I love
doves body washes any nourishing cream

I'm happy that you're here I'm Stephanie
Jenny deserve a big house you're an
awesome person thank you and it's
honestly like people and somebody asked
me like if it was because i'm earning a
lot of money on youtube and no it's not
because of YouTube miss feels John my
husband John owning the tattoo studio
catches shoes been doing really really
well lately so that's why we could
afford to move somebody asked me that
but it's not if not YouTube it's not
definitely not YouTube earnings one
thing you can do if you're ever curious
what people make on YouTube there's a
website called social blade I've always
wanted to make a video about social
blade because social blade is the
ultimate snooping website it's linked up
with youtube its YouTube certified
website so
it links directly to YouTube and it
tells you basically what everybody's
making on YouTube gives you a range but
what I found is if you look if you like
go on social blade and you search for
somebody you go to whatever it says the
top number that they're making for me
it's about half of what that top number
is so it says a thousand dollars a month
is what is like my top of my range right
now I'm making about five hundred
dollars a month so um you know like if
you look up like Manny like Manny mua
like he makes so much money according to
social blade like oh my god she makes
like seventy-five thousand dollars a
year I was like what I don't know if
it'll even search for him if i zoom an
emu a no he's got a different name but
like it's the ultimate snooping um see
if it'll let me know it won't let me cuz
i forget what his real name is on he he
signed up under something else but oh my
gosh that man makes so much money like a
little like goals goals but no I'm not
making that much money on YouTube
definitely dollar per hour it's like
less than McDonald's like her or
whatever whatever the the minimum wage
is way less than that uh let's see
keightley Sanchez good morning everyone
good morning to you and happy birthday
to John I will let him know Little John
good morning are you guys apart um oh
it's 1131 let's just go Jenna she sung
about um use a bliss all this weekend

product okay the product that she sent
me she's sells for perfectly posh which
is like a makeup thing where you can be
the independent consultant wherever she
sent me a bunch of stuff to try and
there's like an anti-aging thing that
I'm trying that she sent me I'm gonna do
