my uh my sister-in-law we don't live in
the same house obviously so be the same
situation saini Lanie good morning my
dear nikki is talking to Kiki oh I love
how you guys are talking to each other
it makes me so happy hi Tyler ty Jensen
she'll be moving do you have a make any
makeup packaging tips hope the packing
is going well my makeup packaging tip is
to pack it in a box and carry it myself
that's okay i am like bagging it gently
like i have bubble wrap where I'm just
gonna I think what I'm going to do is
just like lay a layer and do some bubble
wrap and lay a layer and do some bubble
wrap and lay layer and do some bubble
wrap you know not let wrap each
individual thing because that's going to
take me forever and then just gently
carry my babies to my new house look
there's no way like we decided to break
down to get movers this year which is
like so stinking expensive but we've
been here this is where in our eighth
year living in this house and we have
lost stuff and we just we just decided
to suck it up and just get some movers
and we have a
have a really small house so it's not a
lot of up and down steps which is part
of what makes movers expensive is going
up and down steps now the new house has
steps but this house doesn't have any
steps so that's gonna be nice um you
know that it cut the cost down a bit so
that's what I'm doing is I'm carrying
everything myself I'm not letting them
touch the boxes of my makeup that's
going to be my personal quest is to
bring my makeup over I'm gonna carry my
babies to their new location so it's
going to be interesting what the setup
is going to look like two weeks from now
next week is going to be the same setup
and then the following week is going to
be in my new house probably won't look
all fancy shmancy yet but I'm gonna need
some suggestions from you all of you for
how to set up my makeup we have a
filming room like a room just set up for
filming which I'm so excited about yes
so excited so we're going from owning to
renting so we were able to rent a place
that's quite a bit larger than where
we're living now some very excited say
definitely need some advice on that now
this is the one thing I want to ask you
guys it's it's a dilemma twinkly lights
are no twinkly lights because I get
compliments all the time for not having
twinkly lights but people with twinkly
lights people seem to like their twinkly
lights do I get twinkly likes I don't
think I'm gonna get twinkly lights but
I'd love to hear your thoughts on
twinkly lights behind people in their
backgrounds just curious I just love to

mega product and it's like how many
eyeliner does a girl really need you

more there's more I got Mary Lou what
else I mean you guys get the point I
have so many highlighters it's just
ridiculous oh and then I've got the
what-you-call-it palette the hourglass
palette I mean how long is it going to
take me just to get through this
hourglass palette really and truly I
mean this was this would take year
just to go through this one ballot I
don't need it I don't need it it looks
very similar to one of the hourglass
shape I don't know if it is very similar
but it looks very similar to this one
over here which is the radiant light I
don't know it's possible though my point
is is I have a lot of highlighters and
everybody my mother's gonna be reviewing
that thing and of course everybody's
going to say how fabulous it is um you
know because it probably is fabulous but
I don't need it did you get a Channing
about the long strong answer Kevin did
you get it anybody get it do they make
it the Jacqueline whole palette not
palette the it should be about four
thirty eight dollars anybody get the the
highlighter it looks gorgeous but dude
dude thirty-eight dollars alright yeah
I'm trying to move girlfriend that's
like quarter of my move in fee and I'm
just kidding it's not them all right
Cathy can't wait for the Android app
yeah me either i'm i haven't heard from
the developers they're a bunch of people
on the app that gave a bunch of
suggestions I screencap did I sent it to
the developers so hopefully they'll
implement some of the suggestions that
were put in and I haven't heard anything
about the android app last they told me
was middle of July I'll keep you posted
I haven't heard anything and to plot my
old iPad and download the app until the
Android comes out okay yeah yeah yeah um
happy fourth to you Amy good morning
Kristen game is here hi Kristen game yay
hello Kristen so good to see you you've
probably been obstinate like five
o'clock in the morning early bird all
right no twinkly lights Karina says
kareena kapoor girlfriend good to see
you I see I'm with you on the note to my
clients Lanie says she loves the fairy
lights but she's a nerd Lori says still
anxiously awaiting the app but in the
meantime still enjoying the facebook
page yes some some people i just created
the wets of the makeup facebook page to
continue conversations from the chat
which I'm really excited about so if you
want you can go over to Facebook search
for what's up and make up i believe is
how you find it if you can't find it
there i'm sure someone will post a link
in the chat window
think we can do that and we're having
conversations over there after the chat
is over so if you were on facebook that
now exists Thank You flory for
mentioning that Nicki are you planning
on getting the new Urban Decay palette
the smoky palette I'm assuming any good
suggestions on essential I shadow
brushes more toward high-end I didn't
step on my eyeshadow brush game congrats
on the move I am not planning on getting
the smoky palette I think my
sister-in-law is gonna get and I'm just
going to borrow it to try it and then
I'm gonna pass it back because it
doesn't call to me it doesn't it doesn't
make me go yes I need that in my life
like I don't know I don't know why it
doesn't call to me but yeah um I shadow
brushes honestly girlfriend like I don't
have a lot of high-end i shadow brushes
i have i have more expensive face
brushes but don't have a lot of more
expensive eyeshadow brushes so the
honestly the eyeshadow brushes that I
use a lot let me take my brother's out
Russians are back here okay I say what
are some once you know you can never go
wrong with it cosmetics it cosmetics has
fantastic brushes so if you're looking
for more expensive brushes it cosmetics
would probably be a great way to go I
don't own any Sigma brushes I don't own
any mac brushes I just I haven't gone
there and I I just all the time I just
don't go there um let's say so someone's
that I use a lot if you want to go like
the regular regular you know regular
people price range I love my real
techniques techniques eyeshadow brush
set this purple set this is my favorite
one from that set this is the base
shadow brush this thing is fab oh my
gosh this thing is amazing so I use it
to pack on color but I can also use it
because of the point at the top I can
use it up into my crease to blend so
this is really an all-in-one awesome
awesome awesome eyeshadow brush things
fab it's definitely one of my favorite
eyeshadow brushes of all time if you
want to go super high-end I own one
Wayne Goss brush this I got it in that
beautylish bag or whatever that
beautylish subscription thingy there
were it's like one time of year it's
like a lucky box or something i have a
video on my review of that box but this
is wayne goss brush number 20 and i love
love this brush it is so
san lee soft i want to get more super
high-end brushes but they're just so
expensive and it's like I have trouble
justifying it but this is perfect for
getting right up into the crease for
detailing its of course not a blending
brush it's more for getting color right
where you need it I was doing a lot of
cut crease looks for a while and this
was what I was using for cut crease
looks and I love this brush with this
brush itself I think is like thirty
dollars smooth that and it's just this
little teeny tiny one brush where the
Real Techniques said is like 15 bucks
for the entire sets so but I don't have
any other brush this like very very
thankful to have this one so those would
be my suggestions I mean mostly like I
would say if you want it for ones that i
would i would go for i would say
definitely check into the cosmetics ones
from my own personal experience if
anybody has any suggestions for for
Nicki at Nicki and give her some
eyeshadow brush suggestions she's
looking for more high-end suggestions
for that so I know there's a bunch of
mac ones that are supposedly amazing but
I don't own those what I can bounce warm
all right maybe she's saying thank you I
wished her well on her vacation hope you
have an awesome summer and when I get
back you're going to be gone for the
whole summer oh my gosh vacation I'm
think he'd be gone for like a week Oh
summer when I get back I'll watch all
your videos you're not even gonna have a
good all summer oh my gosh whoa and my
sis is Mary so she lives with her
husband okay Oh samer Mary I'm gonna
miss you too oh my gosh I can't believe
it alright just bakes cakes hello my
dear jen i'm headed to ulta later to get
my hair cut out i want to treat myself
to something fun i love lip products and
lip palettes but i'm trying to go
outside my box what are you loving
lately from Ulta from Ulta and you're
looking for lip products and pallets mmm
whoa on the spot on the spot okay I'm
kind of think cuz i'm not a huge older
person which i'm going to be because
guess how close in Alta is to my house
like super close to my new house um
let's see mm-hmm I'm trying to think I'm
trying to back to what's up a makeup as
far as what is real
what do they sell it all to these days
as far as oh gosh girlfriend you're
killing me lip products and pallets um
well so you know I feel like mmm for lip
products my favorite high-end lip
product formula is the two-faced look
red lipsticks those are amazing uh let's
see anything else and you're looking you
go go into ulta so you could get some
drug store stuff have you tried if you
want drugstore I know you're probably
not even look at a drugstore but if you
are these NYX matte rude matte lipsticks
or fab I love these things I mean does
it really have to be expensive to be
awesome I don't think so these these are
amazing these are absolutely amazing i
love them they're not drying their i
would say the moisturizing but they're
not drawing they stay on for ever
awesome um let's see pallet wise hell it
was I don't know see this is the
accounts are so personal you know
they're so personal everybody has their
things that they're really like loving
you know as far as what they like on
themselves some people relate naturals
and people like colors are saying you
want to step out of your comfort zone
this is a really nice i know i talk
about this all the time but this is a
really nice stepping out of the comfort
zone palette because you can use some of
these neutral shades and still come up
with a beautiful look um and then you
can add just a pop of color like just
throwing this you know blue on your
lower lash line are this orange on your
lower lash line or the booty lon your
lower lash line or a blackberry you know
busting that up in the crease your knees
one of these neutral colors and
blackberry up in the crease you know and
then you've got this malted milk ball
which is a gorgeous gorgeous brown this
is a really nice transitioning into
color palettes I really love this thing
I know I talk about all the time but I
love it I really really really love it
I'm trying to think what else would be
good it's like relatively new do you
want new stuff um anything else back
here that's like standing out no not
really not really ok if anybody else has
any quest any suggestions for ulta at
jes jes s and give her some ulta
suggestions for some things that might
be
good for her um but those are some
things that i love i hope that helps i
feel like it wasn't very helpful but i
hope that helps all right Megan just
want to let everyone know that
Jacqueline's highlights back and stuff
online I saw that oh my gosh I thought
it was gonna be gone forever i thought
was gonna be up for like an hour and
then be gone forever but it seems to be
like pretty much still rocking which is
smart abeka to do that really really
smart not to let it completely sell out
I mean there's no reason for it to
completely solid I mean they anticipated
they planned well it was they really did
it right back i mean everybody needs to
kind of learn from that experience from
whatever becca did with Sephora they
will support of course gonna have a
giant server compared to like color pop
and more fee um but they did it right
and they didn't let it sell out which is
really smart because I would have bought
the Jacqueline Hill palette for morphine
if it I if it hadn't sold out I would
have bought it but I figured by the time
ma I got to it after and it sold out
like eva is it even in stock at this
point the morphe jaclyn hill palette i
don't know but i figured if the by the
time i bought it every one of the
grandmother would have reviewed it and
it just wasn't worth it so I didn't get
it but I would have bought it if it
hadn't sold out so they lost my money
and I however many people else they lost
their money but I'm really excited that
Becca did it right and then everybody
that wants it is able to get it i think
that's awesome krista no twinkly lights
to middle school bedroom thank you see
that makes me feel better krista because
i was thinking you know like i see so
many people with the twinkly lights man
and it's like do I should i do twinkly
lights too should I jump on the
bandwagon too twinkly lights but you're
right you're so right middle school
bedroom you're so right I need help
designing need help glory says yes trick
lies they've law really i don't know now
if Lori says yes I don't know we'll see
maybe candles flory maybe candles
instead of twinkly lights I don't know
Amy how do you keep up with um with
what's up and make up I think is what
you're trying to ask I have a lot of
people that help me that's how I keep up
it's it's a lot of work though
girlfriend it's a lot of work Cathy pack
an overnight bag oh she's giving
suggestions for how to
mac makeup I believe pack an overnight
bag while moving with essentials for
everybody including your makeup oh she's
giving um chanting suggestions for me
from moving including your makeup for a
few days I misplace my favorite eyeliner
on the move years ago on a random box I
packed well exhausted oh no but that's
really smart though you know like a few
days before moving just pack you know
like know three or four days for
everybody and then just pack everything
else up that's so smart oh my gosh
gaffney thank you I'm totally gonna do
that in the shrimp John he's gonna love
that idea thank you so much i love that
I'm Shelby oh my god I jen i love you i
love you two Shelby I love that name
Shelby to it's such a nice name all
right let's see Kiki I got the jaclyn
hill can't wait for it but it's sold out
in four hours I saw that but its back
Kiki its back and you believe it I'm
glad you got it though I would love to
know how it's working out for you it
seems to be a pretty universal product
so I'm hoping that it works out well for
everybody because I know there was so
much hype surrounding it Karen hi Jana
really like your videos hugs from Sweden
hugs too sweetie I'm hugging you Sweden
right now um thank you Karen for being
here let's see girly scout one jen and
everyone are there any color pop coupon
codes out there i want to try the
glosses should I yay or nay I don't
really like goopy lip products okay so
this is the thing kathleenlights if you
do her name in all lowercase that is the
coupon code that i use its five dollars
off so if you get the if you don't order
up through free shipping if you don't
order enough then that will give you
free shipping if you order enough then
we'll give you an additional five
dollars off that's the code that I
always that I've been used always use
like I've been using it for ever that's
the code that I've been using is
kathleenlights um the lip glosses okay
so let me get out where's my color pop
box okay they're not goopy they're not
gooping let me show you the ones that i
have 0 8 glosses I don't have it oh wait
hold on a minute whore on glosses are
they are they back in stock the glosses
are you talking about the UM are you I'm
at the liquid lipsticks I think you're
talking about these
the ultra matte lip thanks I don't have
glosses like straight-up glosses I don't
know but anyway these are these are
definitely not sticky goo be um no now
i'm confused now unlike they have
classes am i missing something let me
let me go Missy I don't think they have
like shrimp losses I think that you mean
the lip creams yeah I think you do okay
I just don't want to be an idiot and be
like you know Jen they have glosses
don't you know like it's didn't one of
you you know like behind on that okay so
if you mean the the colour-pop ultra
matte lip things these are not goofy at
all there is this one is called saulo
s.o.l.o w let me switch to my view so i
can see that you guys can see mmm okay
oh the lighting in here is actually
pretty good today alright so it feels
very flat to go on it does not feel
goofy at all and you can see it's got a
little bit of shine until it dries and
then there's your mat you see how it's a
little shiny still over here and then
there's it's turning that and these
things stay on girlfriend I used one
yesterday oh my gosh then you see on
forever um unfortunately I was dumb and
I also used I got these from Jake a
beauty and I used one of these and it
was what happened was i used i used this
one and it was too crazy so I put one of
the color but wins over tough so I don't
know what in the world formula I was
dealing with yesterday but these are
also good um at least from my experience
yesterday my lip color did not come off
all day long I was like I was almost
like get off your to break get off like
the lipstick that I was wearing and
what's up and make a video it was like
all day long like to the point where i
was almost annoying me I kept trying to
put lighter colors over top of it to
make it go away but anyway I'm so off
topic I'm saying is these are not goofy
at all their feel very flat they feel
very smooth the this was not drying for
me I definitely not moisturizing in any
way at all but it's not drawing um and
it's not goofy and anyway so but you're
looking for a lip
I don't know if that's what you're
looking for because these are definitely
mad they're not glossy at all let's say
so let's okay moving on hopefully that
was helpful my dear Nicki um she says no
lights lol unless you make that funny
video like raw Beauty Christine T gym
yes you guys never seen Rob uni Christie
her video making fun of typical beauty
youtubers it's pretty funny when the
doing Lee lights in background she's
funny she's really funny I'm subscribe
to her Channel I really like her
actually think that was the video that
made me subscribe to her uh cami good
morning let's see Nikki they broke the
JH 1 backe yesterday I don't know if
it's still oh they brought that they
brought the j jacqueline hill one back
yesterday i don't know if it's still
suck online i think it is the Jacqueline
hill highlight I think it's still online
zany Laney Jen question as reviewers and
makeup lovers how do you make sure you
are not being wasteful and give love to
the makeup that you have I'm overwhelmed
as anyone have a system to rotate ok
right now I don't have a system um and
it shows like I I definitely don't give
love to as much stuff as I should I have
a bunch of things that I need to I need
to pass on and and it's sad because this
is the thing my makeups like my babies
look I love my makeup but if stupid like
the amount of blush that I have alone is
just stupid so I really need to do
decluttering videos and get rid of a lot
of this but it's painful for me like
it's literally painful it's like I'm
such a hoarder I can't I can't and it's
like but I really need to do it because
you're right things you know get out of
date and they go bad and it's wasteful
and I assume no I have no system I had a
request yesterday yesterday to do
project 10pm but the problem with that
is is I have products that I'm
constantly trying so if I'm doing
project 10 pan I'm never gonna make it
I'm never gonna make it because I'm
always trying new things because you
know like Jake at Beauty sent me this
you know all this stuff and it's like I
have to try this for the video so that
means every other lip product that i
have is on hold they just sent me these
so I have to try these so that's on hold
I got
and all the other lip products ever on
hold I just got the colour-pop ones that
I'm trying so that's on hold I have a
color part of I shadows that I'm trying
I got the elf I shadows which the video
is coming up I'm editing right now so
that should be up sometime next week all
my ELF reviews so all those elf palettes
i just bought those i will be reviewing
i'm still playing like they're making
sure that you know I well not really
because I already I already know what I
think of them but but you get my point
so every time I get a new product I have
to put everything else of that kind on
hold while I try out that product like
the two-faced foundations I've been
playing with these a lot so I haven't
been using my other foundations I know I
think you get the point I'm going on and
on but I don't have a system to rotate I
just need to I need to get rid of stuff
is what it comes down to I need to pass
some stuff on but it's heartbreaking
beauty all for one one my Instagram
friend hello ello oh if anybody at laney
if anybody has any suggestions for laney
at lingy LAN ey for how to rotate
through makeup I know a lot of people do
makeup baskets and they rotate through
they use the same basket to make up all
week I'm said they can rotate through
their products but I'm not that not that
disciplines well just say that okay wit
anyway good morning to beauty haul 411

me know how it goes my dear let's see
Anna kanya I did you did get champagne

about that if people are going to be

delaying breakfast to be here aw it's
too papa te o
well I'm happy that you're here my dear
icandy Jenny going to get the lorac Pro
matte palette unloving mine oh I want it
I want everything now and it's night I
don't I don't need more stuff ah
especially not and I'm like thinking
about packing to move and a stupid
amount of products like it's you but
it's it's like we were just talking
about a minute ago like I have at me
it's just dumb I've got this whole this
thing is full of lip products that it's
just not being used they're just these
this is what when I was in wintertime
and I was like ok these are all my
spring lip colors I'm gonna put him in a
bag and then put it away and then bring
them out who this one's open but like
I've got things like these that i never
use and they're really nice these are
the Loreal pom-poms that I got last year
I really like them you know I've got
this naked lip gloss I don't I thought
you know I have to take that out and
just just like something i never used
what like I mean what kind of got stuff
like this this is a Revlon um lip gloss
and I got this in a old boxy charm and
it's like I'm never going to use this
this what I was using to like change up
lip colors a little bit too like cool
them down but I'm never gonna use that
why do I even have that it's like I have
oh I took a top off of another 10 this
another Revlon no sony oh I love this
color doesn't smell stinky that's good
this is ross pink do I love this color
haha lipstick oh no mango butter
lipstick this thing must be old there's
like no pigmentation on this thing I got
to go through the stroke maybe I'll be
my project for today decluttering videos
I want to I want to what I'm scared I'm
scared but no kami I probably will not
get the lorac Pro matte palette even
though it looks amazing and I do in my
heart want it but my mind is telling me
that no even though I really do want it
Jamie happy fourth of July to you my
dear she needs to download the what to
make of app you should you should it's a
free download like many people got
confused the beginning thinking you
would have to pay for the app but you
don't want to pivot out like the best
parts of the app or free the added extra
stuff is just like little videos you do
on the side like I did
I just filmed it's gonna be hopefully
going up today my julep unboxing of you
know swatches of what i got for jewel
because I don't do julep on my youtube
channel because it's just you know most
people don't really I don't know if they
care about Julia but my Jill video so do
very well so I did a little julep
unboxing on the app so that's in the
paid section I did you know just an a
draw unboxing of my box e-tron when I
got it you know I'm but I mean I did a
review of that on the YouTube channel so
the reviews of the the the boxes and
things are on the YouTube channel it's
just like the raw first impression stuff
is going on the paint sexually out but
the best part of the app is not that
that's good but the best part of the app
is the community and posting up pictures
like yesterday like I did my nails for
fourth of July okay my nails I think
that came out pretty cute but I'm not
putting this up on Instagram like
there's no way I mean what is that what
was i even thinking I don't know I'm not
putting that on Instagram but I can put
it on the app because we're community
and we support each other and you know
there was one girl that put up her nails
and you could tell that she just
probably wasn't really used to doing a
lot of nail art but she tried you can
tell she tried and it looked really cute
you know that she had and she probably
wasn't used to doing a lot but she felt
comfortable enough to put her nail art
on the app and that's the free part like
I said so if you download the app I
really would think that you will love it
it's like an Instagram ish kind of
community but it's like a safe instagram
ish community where we can post our
faces of the day without feeling like we
need to be perfect all the time and that
people are going to judge us you know
like trying out a new way to do I
shudder whatever i'm posting a picture
and getting feedback I mean it's like
it's so fun it's so fun i love my app i
love it there are things that I don't
love about my app that I feel like could
be better but overall the community is
fab highly recommend you download the
free part the paid part is bonus if you
want to do it fine if not fine but the
free part I definitely highly recommend

thing is awesome in net I love it I'm
Jess Jam thank you for your suggestions
you're the best thank you i love the
sugar pop palette but you totally
inspired me to use it differently than I
do so that's awesome oh okay so you
already own it okay whoo alright Chad
good morning all I'm late to the chap
it's so glad to find it going strong so
glad to have you here jen and then steph
obsessed with the macaroon and the sugar
pop palette yes oh me too I mean it's
such a cool shade like you look at it
and you're like oh my gosh do I really
want to put that on my island but I'm
telling you every time I
this color I get compliments every time
it is so pretty it's just a matter of
blending in some other colors so that
it's not the only color on your lid you
know using this one to soften it using
this one to deepen up the crease you
know what I mean like it's about working
with it so that it's not the only color
the man it's beautiful oh so pretty so
pretty I completely completely agree all
right got 20 minutes left oh my goodness
all right all right Amy says Jen did you
say anything about benefit new stuff I
know benefit had a new kit but I think
it's for vib and vib rouge only where it
was like a bunch of like sampling things
but only there's a lot of benefits stuff
coming out right now Nicki loves her
sugar pop palette to very good very good
me too Kristen I was the same way with
the morphe palette I want to do for
looks video but I gave it huh no right
that would have been a good for looks
one pallet Kristen with the morphe
jaclyn hill palette that would have been
also that would have been fab but I
thing was too hard to get and then I
went to I mass and supposedly they were
selling it I mask I was not waiting two
hours in line for that palette there's
just no way people crazy going waiting
two hours in line for stuff I give
people credit like I'm not trying to say
anything negative about people that wait
in line for two hours at imats but I'm
not wasting two hours in the line I
can't do that like I waited in one line
and that was because I was standing with
Cassie from proof deck and it was
because of the conversation I didn't
even get anything it was in the Knicks
line we were in the line I was in line
with her for about an hour and I just
had I was just having a conversation
where I didn't buy anything that's the
only way I'm waiting in the lines if I
have a good friend to stand there and
have a conversation well yeah there were
people waiting in line a long time for
that Jacqueline Hill morphy palette at
IMATS it was craziness alright but yeah
I think that would have been a nice for
looks one pallet Kristin but what are
you gonna do what he had Nicki did
anyone pick up the limited edition
colour-pop line this weekend I did not I
had it in my car and then I backed out I
thought about getting up but I just got
I just got the lipsticks and I'm gonna
do a color pop video and we're gonna be
done with Kali pop for a hot minute
there's other things to try I but yeah
I'm just going to try those lipsticks
for a few days I'll probably film the
colour-pop review next weekend let's see
flora yikes
I never act my age okay maybe nice wall
hanging LOL Florida's talking about the
twinkly lights I was asking if I new
setup for those nearest joining us i was
asking I cuz I'm moving in two weeks
next week we'll still be here and then
the following week I'll be in my new
house so for I was saying should I get
twinkly lights if Laurie was like yes
and everybody else is like no and
somebody was saying is very middle
school bedroom so Laurie is like saying
you know she never access xr8 but you
know what they're popular for a reason
flory there are a lot of people that
love those twinkly lights just like you
just because there's a lot of people
disagreeing and the chat today does not
mean there aren't people that agree with
you there were a lot of people that
agree with you and that's why I asked
for you so don't feel bad my dear please
don't feel bad alright crap plans 24
says wait what happened what happened to
what I want to know what happens sandra
lynn loves makeup hello she says yes to
the twinkly lights see there you go
flory sandra agrees with you how about a
neon what suvamay cosine of america that
would be awesome just w you IM in the
background i was thinking about trying
to set up like a like a newsdesk kind of
situation but i don't know how that
would look you know like a like a makeup
newsdesk like how would that look like I
can't even imagine it so I have to like
to think about that but it'd be cool to
have like multiple setups in the room
you know cuz there's four walls so could
I do you know like a look a filming you
know for regular videos wall and then do
a wall for what's up and make up like I
don't know I'm also playing around the
idea which I wasn't going to tell you
guys about it but I'm gonna tell you
because I have all these ambitions and
then I don't necessarily do them like
last week it was talking about the
podcast you Lillian I trauma due on
podcast which we're still talking about
podcasts um but that kind of went on
hold for a little bit we're also talking
about doing for the chat for to have
guests on which we're still trying to
figure out apparently the chat doesn't
do what we wanted to do which was having
like a little box where there's somebody
else in the chat with us so they can
have like guests on but apparently it
doesn't work like that so I learned that
last week but now this is the new idea
like anybody know anything about ASMR
anybody ever watch ASMR videos because
like I'm obsessed I know it's weird ASMR
video
are weird if you don't know ASMR it's
like this whole YouTube subculture and
like some people really love them my
husband thinks that they're weird my
daughter loves them my son thinks
they're weird it might be a girl thing i
don't know but i love them i say my
doing an ASMR channel um because i think
will be fun I think would be fun I don't
know I'm thinking about it I know that's
weird but it'd be a totally separate
from my beauty youtube channel they be
completely separate but thinking about
doing that so I'm thinking about in the
filming room to have like a green screen
section to do like ASMR videos or maybe
just like a white wall to do I some more
videos I don't know it's just an idea I
don't know anybody here watch ASMR
videos I don't know if you don't watch
them and don't judge me because I like
them it's so weird I'm like embarrassed
that I like ASMR videos but i love them
i would assess like i'll be making
dinner I don't have an ASMR video I'm
while making dinner you know or i'll be
editing a video and i'll have ASMR
videos on on headphones while editing
videos it's just I'm obsessed I'm cest
um but anyway totally off topic okay any
kitty one justin jet indicating one says
yes the candles no pink i hate pink try
peacock blue and white something that
looks crisp and cool that's a great idea
I was thinking about doing like cream
colors like I got these really cool
painting should i get my my paintings
but these little things I should show
you hold on I'll be right back yes yes
yes I will Lila wants to know if I can
look at something so I got these on
hautelook to put in the backgrounds I
don't know can you guys see let me see
let me go over here oh wait hold on
what's happening here can you guys see
me doesn't look like I'm live anymore
wait hold on a minute will pop up I'm on
the wrong thing there we go okay so
there's one it's still wrapped up so
there's one and there and whether one
that I got that I thought was really
cool is the other one so I was thinking
about putting these in the background
and doing this kind of color scheme like
a flick Oh a comb no like a class
see like maybe like an off like a baby
kind of pink if you see that these are
like a glare on there but like maybe
like déjà kinds of pink and white kind
of thing I don't know just an idea I
figured this color neutral enough that
I'll be able to play around good love
that one I think that one's so cool um I
figure I'll be able to play around with
them and I know I'll be able to add some
colors with that because those are so
neutral so we'll see you'll see oh I got
12 minutes left I better hurry up i'm at
Gavin ok moving on thank you for your
feedback I don't think there will be
pink if there is pink it's going to be
like a muted like almost like like this
kind of pink like a nudie kind of pink
like that kind of pink would be as pink
as it would get no bright pink mMmmm um
let's see craft land 624 hi Jen love
your videos thank you so much I
appreciate that a lot let's see oh

use i try to know i can't even see I try
to stay with them I I try products that
i feel like people want reviews for and
i honestly like omni honest with you I
don't pay attention to that stuff
because I I just do reviews for YouTube
and I just don't take it that seriously
I probably should because I know that
these ingredients are very bad for me
but i don't know i mean i think a lot of
products are not are paraben free at
this point especially at sephora and all
that which is a lot honestly a lot of
what i use but yeah i don't know i I
don't I don't really pay attention but
you are a hundred percent right I should
be paying more attention you're right i
mean at the environmental working group

about it but I I'm not as good as I
should be with that but you're right I'm
wrong you're right what you're going to

the app in the community i'm so glad
very positive fun to browse and post
thank you so much I'm so glad you're
enjoying the app
am loving it as well yay make up new gen
exactly the app is a safe is a safe
instagram and everyone is so sweet and I
learn a lot from everyone I get
inspiration from everyone yeah one thing
about that I like is the description of
the app is actually kind of terrible
like if you go into the App Store and
you read the description it sounds very
generic and dumb but I kind of like it
like that because it keeps people that
don't know us out like people that may
troll people that may hate you know it
keeps them out and I want it to be like
a safe community so i'm really loving
that it's small I think there's been
like 900 downloads but there's probably
a good 50 to 70 people that are the ones
that are really active on it so i really
like it small like that because it keeps
it nice and safe and awesome so if it
doesn't grow i'm cool with that because
we have a great community going on there
it's so awesome yay and I get
inspiration from people there too oh my
gosh some of the things that I see on
there definitely inspirational name eeee

Instagram everyone is trying to just be
so negative and pick out small things
like so what so what if my eyeliner
isn't even or there's polished my
cuticles let's be real here I know
that's what I'm talking about and what
hurts what hurts my heart is all of the
companies that post up pictures of
people using their products you never
use normal looking people ok the people
that they use are like freak you're
sleepy
full like beautiful gorgeous amazing
looking people it always look perfect if
I can't you put a real person on there
for once you know like I like you know
you look at like morphe and you look at
you know anastasiya like I'm follow them
on Instagram and some of the gorgeous
looks at people come up with like maybe
I'm just jealous I don't know but they
don't look real like i don't i don't
feel like if i did that eyeshadow look I
wouldn't look like that you know like oh
I'm saying like a lot but hmmm can can't
I just post a normal-looking people on
there sometimes that's all I'm trying to
say so we just go over to the what's up

I'm dealing with these dev is Amy Laney
says yes take community back yes I agree
I agree girl he's got one Jen just
hearing you talk about your app is
really sweet say the community is
something that's been long overdue for
girls that are just being with makeup I
agree they give this fun and
light-hearted I agree and it needs to be
that way when you stop taking it so

I was saying earlier for eight years and
we've got to get out of this teeny tiny
house we're moving into a much much
bigger house it's almost twice the size
of the house we're living in now so so
much so he did ah let's see toy says I
post my nails on Instagram all the time
but I don't ever claim to know what i'm
doing LOL good for you good for you and
your bravery I am NOT brave enough kochi
chick 1275 yay hello my dear received a
gift card from Sephora I'm looking for
suggestion i love pallets i'm always
looking for a holy grail foundation on
combo to oily love alta more but my mom
like sephora LOL ok suggestions for
pallets and a holy grail foundation for
combo doily ok of course i get to this
question where i'm like like the last
question ok so it's like I get in a rut
like I start using certain pallets and
then I stopped using other ones ok the
two-faced pallets are fab any of the but
little box ones like these these are
awesome this is like more I think for
deeper skin tones but I really like this
one a lot we can we can use it with our
lighter skin tone but um but I think
it's better for a deeper skin tone or if
you're you know going out at night a lot
let's see any other I mean Urban Decay
palette or just a force fab anything
also here that's like Sephora try think
anything else that I'm like loving right
now of course kat von d like pallets are
amazing so if you're looking for those
those are awesome and then foundation
wise see I'm normal skin so I hate
recommending for specific skin types
because I'm normal skin normal to lately
all mostly let's say Sephora
oh no man i would I don't want to
recommend something bad because i don't
have normal oily skin if you have any
suggestions poachy chick um just you at
poetry um and give her some suggestions
for combo to oily skin for foundations
because I don't want to I don't want to
guess and recommend something wrong I'd
rather not recommend anything then
recommend something wrong for you and
thanks for the shoutout I'm Monica Baron
on your app okay oh yay hello oh good to
see you oh no I know who you are yay
awesome yay okay Kristin getting lots of
love as she should Steph trying to I was
trying to fudge the link enough to post
it but nicki nale dat huh yeah okay this
is gonna be the last one because I have
to go and play with my kids sink 1961 i
also bought the newest tart palette with
the Jacqueline helbeck of highlighter
tart has to stop coming out with a
pretty palette every month oh no I can't
help but buying but I'm going broke I
know ok we're gonna do this last one
from Nikki I heard good things about the
new benefit colored liners but I've
heard the push-up liner is me I love
that I the color eyeliner what mascara I
don't know I tried last year I tried the
ciate colored mascara and I hated it it
was terrible as far as the benefit
push-up liner mine dried out really fast
and also the tip it's really that tip is
critical because as you use it it starts
to bend more which makes it harder to do
that wing so if you do end up getting
one of the benefit push-up liners
there's a little little plastic stopper
you want to keep that stopper and make
sure you put it in there after every use
because I think that's why I'm I'm dry
now is because I throw away the stopper
and then it dried out but the tip you
just got to be really careful with that
with that play the rubber tip and make
sure that you take good care of it so
that it doesn't get really Benny and
floppy because once it does you can't
get the way anymore it's like done so
all right so it's 1107 I've got to get
going and go hang out with my fam
because I told
with them that we are gonna go to the
grocery store and we gotta do other
things today I gotta pack a bunch of
stuff from moving so i'm gonna go ahead
and get out of here but thank you so
much for joining this morning it was so
fun talking with you I'm telling you
this brightens up my sundays every
single Sunday I love coming here talking
to you all um you know I wish that we
can have a more functional like a way
that we could all be like actually
physically talking like instead of just
me and my big face and I wish that it
could be more like spread out with lots
of people you know talking I think that
would be fun like if we were actually in
a really in a room together like how
awesome would that be to like really
hang out so but anyway thank you so much
for being here I appreciate you happy
Sunday mad love and I will see you soon
