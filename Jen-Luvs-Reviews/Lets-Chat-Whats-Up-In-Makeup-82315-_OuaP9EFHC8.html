to get going oh my goodness I didn't
think it was gonna Scott good morning my
friends welcome to the winds up and make
up whoa a little stress freaked out
over the show go in line this morning I
woke up to an unplugged computer and the
show wasn't uploaded and I was like a
little freaked out session but it's all
good it's working now so the show is
live and I'm happy about it
unfortunately so late so chances are
you're watching the slide you probably
haven't watched a show yet because it
went up like 12 minutes late and it's
like 20-some minutes show so hopefully
we'll be getting some new people after
they have a chance to watch a show all
the way through but until then let's
hang out and talk because that's what we
do best right I was reading some of the
conversation about going back to school
hi Sandra by the way hi Steph and you
don't know me hello hey Shannon and
LeAnn hey Jenna and yeah that's it that
I read all of your comments so far
talking about going back to school and
commiserating I had a parent we had like
a little back to school thing what was
it on Thursday where parents were
allowed to come and bring their kids and
was like an ice cream thing and you know
the parents came in they brought the
kids they got to see the teachers and
meet the teacher shake hands and
everything and drop off school supplies
and when the parents looked at me and
was like take her take her I don't like
it's cool Decker just looks like a
really nice kid but I think sometimes
parents you know need a break from
having their kids home all day you know
the kids get bored so they get excited
about sending kids back to school but
the hustle and bustle of everything like
I can imagine it can be a little
stressful and some people depending on
your schedule but for me I'm excited I'm
excited for a new school year I'm
excited about the teachers I'm gonna be
working within the kids and be working
with and I'm gung-ho talk to me in a
week and I may may have a different
attitude right now feeling good
all right let's see Sandra says she's
gonna go to Sephora today and get some
samples hey I want to come with you know

nonsense will know we'll know what's
happening there Sarah and baby blue good
morning to you and that rhyme didn't do
that on purpose how would you check
hello man's are so good to see you let's
see Sarah Jen good morning my dear good
morning everybody I'm still mad at
sephora i'll probably get over it
probably i'm not mad at sephora anymore
i got over it I'm just you know I can
only say mad at people so long even in
general even they do something really
mean to me I can't hold grudges I'm
terrible at but I mean those those Holly
palettes come out and all grudges will
be off but this is the thing the Sephora
you know the the points thing the epic
rewards that was crazy the only thing
that made me realize is that i really
don't care about being a vib rouge
anymore and I talked to say I was
talking with Sandra about this like I
just I don't care anymore like it
doesn't it doesn't matter me I don't
feel like the status is worth it um you
know to spend a thousand dollars you get
that status I mean little things like I
was able to get the burberry $30 thing
here which is really cool I'm glad I was
able to get it but did I really need
this no wait till I'm not a vib version
then I want something and then I'll be
like I wish I was at the idea breach
we'll see what happens but as of now I'm
not going to be a vib rouge for next
year cuz i'm not going to work on
spending 500 bucks by the end of the
year but we'll see what happens all
right Allison good morning I can finally
watch and join the chat of my computer
yay happy to have you here Sandra it was
an Oreo commercial before you were alive
oh good too nosy I didn't see the
commercial they don't show me the
commercial I'm this down on the Oreo
commercial or do you like my favorite
cookie of all time when I was a kid
everyone's got their way of eating oreos
I'm gonna eat where is this has nothing
to do with makeup we'll get to make up
in a minute but you know when you twist
off the top this is double stufs only
work with double stufs and they can take
I took the middle out and then i set it
aside and i just put the cookie back
together and I don't the cookie and ate
it until I had this big pile of middles
and then I would form it into a ball and
i would eat it and that's what i did
with my Oreos when I was a kid I was on
that in a really long time but Oreos
have a special place in my heart good
morning Nicki good to see I was hoping
to see you this morning KJ good to see
you my dear mini me she the new brownie
batter Oreos are amazing you think that
this was a food food Chet hopefully
people that are watching this recorded
aren't annoying but the fact that we're
not talking about makeup but you know
it's whoever's in chat if you want to
talk about whatever y'all want to talk
about I love Oreos we talk about Oreos
have to all be about makeup right uh
Billy and clarifying as well about the
Oreo thing uh Rhonda good morning from
Nashville good morning to you Sammy I
work at a university here in canada we
don't return until the tuesday after
Labor Day we're gearing up to that's
nice I think it's nice to start after
labor day that's my opinion LeAnn's just
spent a hundred bucks online ulta the
two-faced Vegas nay pallet being sold
now and oh it's being sold now and when
you spend 40 bucks you get a Gucci
sample perfume in a lotion for free man
that's good to know nice it's easy to
spend man the money so easy to spend I
went on MC last night and I got a
polished choice blush palette for twenty
bucks they had the you know they have
those it C reward things I've only ever
gone not reward it's you have to pay for
it like it's like the collaborations
where they do things that are on sale
from different companies I got one from
polish toys I've never tried polish
choice makeup and I was like filling
twenty bucks for this blush palette
looks really nice so I wanted to try it
and also polish choices all about
natural organic good for you products so
I thought that would be really cool to
try that so I ordered that last night I
don't know if it's so up on the FC
website but i think its retail prices
thirty dollars and then it's one sale
for 20 I check if see every once in a
while and I'm looking see what they have
four points and things
but I'm very rarely buy the things the
only thing I've ever bought before on
the ypsi website was a Jessie's Girl
deal where it was a palette and eyeliner
I think might have just been the Paladin
eyeliner that's all I'm thinking it was
the palette was not good from jesse's
girl oh my gosh it was terrible and then
the eyeliner is my holy grail not my
homegirl it's one of my four holy grail
eyeliners they all perform the same that
Jessie's Girl pen eyeliner is amazing so
that's really why I bought it and and
the pen liner it ended up being that you
basically get the palette for free so so
that was the only time I ever ordered an
Ipsy deal thing so now this will be my
second one with the Polish choice blush
palette if any of you all have ever
gotten anything from the Ipsy like the
little special reward things let me know
because I'd love to know what you've
bought in the past Sandra says I can
crash your shopping spree any time we're
supposed to hang out next week and maybe
shoot a video together Sandra and I that
would be fun Sandra needs to help me
with this crafting box because i went to
go film ok I had this crafting box home
so let me tell you the debacle with the
seem like fabric box ok they contacted
me and asked me to review this fabric
box and it's a DIY craft box and I was
like oh my gosh I know so many of my
subscribers they're all like so many
people are crafters like I think they
would really like this and I am NOT
crafter like I am not good at crafting
in any way at all so I didn't unboxing
where i sat at my chair and I opened it
up and I shouldn't lose in it and there
were no directions it turns out that the
company does all the directions in video
form so the company sent me the video
link and I was watching it and I got all
set up to do it again and then I
realized I couldn't find my iron like
from packing I couldn't find my iron so
I put my stuff back in the box I was
really mad i doing on the floor like you
know packed it up but like open on the
floor and I left the room and I went
downstairs and was cooking dinner or
whatever I came back up and a little
pincushion my dog had like ripped it to
shreds and then like there was a little
bag like a little cutesy little cloth
bag that had a bunch of tools in it the
bag was ripped to shreds they were
pinned
all over my leg door like outside my
door of my my filming room it's like oh
my gosh like I'm lucky my dog didn't die
eating my these pins like oh my gosh so
anyway so this has been like a crazy
trying to film this video like 15 times
so not 15 like three times I've tried to
film it but Sandra might help me do this
because she I'm sure has an iron and I
don't apparently because i lost my iron
when i moved its somewhere it's just not
here so that should be fun getting
sandra in a video sandra I just meant
through what's up and make up through
the app and through comments on the
channel and now we're friends that's how
it works sometimes she's pretty awesome
alright moving on from that story see
what else is going on Ali says hello
Janice and I first come in chat what
would you suggest for someone just
starting with eyebrow makeup is shell
powder a pencil easier to work with i
would say powder probably powder i think
is the most consistently easy to work
with where sometimes with a pencil it
could be too soft and it can feel kind
of sticky in your brows gels sometimes
they like the ones that are like like
one like this like the Maybelline brow
drama and then me the gimme brow these
are not opaque enough for me these are
more like um to hold my brows in place
they don't really fill in for me I guess
it kind of depends on what your need is
to let the shape of your brows but I
would say most consistently brow powder
would probably be the best but you want
to make sure you get a good brush to go
with it and you can get elf ones and
things you have to spend a lot of money
but you want from me this is the easiest
kind of brush to use for Braille
products now you can also do the gel
this kind of gel like the Anasazi of dip
brown but I feel like this can get
really cakey and it can really create
those Instagram rails those perfect like
carved out Browns but I don't know if
you're just starting if you want that if
you want a more natural look I would go
with powder the powder
I use that I really like is the brown
cow by the ball but I don't know if you
feel expendable that really all you
really need is a good brown eyeshadow to
be completely honest and play with it
try it out yo keep her makeup remover
wipe right by your your place when
you're doing your makeup take a brown
shadow that or whatever color your hair
is I should say Brown assuming of brown
hair like me because you know I'm
egocentric like that um whatever color
your hair is find a shadow that looks
like it matches your eyes your your hair
color and practice and see if it looks
good and see if it stays on you know you
just got to kind of play with it you
don't have to buy a separate brow powder
necessarily so I would definitely say
bro powder would be my recommendation
let's say hopefully that helped my dear
okay we're talking about steph's
document I'm waiting to see what the
response is with Sephora first but I
just put an Ulta order yesterday yeah
I'm waiting to see what the response is
too if you're you know out of time like
if you're watching this recorded the
owner of the of Sephora the CEO said
that he would email everybody or
somebody from the company would email
everybody about what about some way to
fix why everyone was so upset about the
epic awards and not being able to get
them he's going to send an email out so
we're kind of all waiting on that at
this point Steph is is waiting Lee Anne
says so far is crazy with any promotion
and it's like Black Friday with them LOL
that's what it seems like you don't know
me hope you have fun can't get video get
to get the video to work so just watch
it tomorrow I don't know did you refresh
that makes me so sad why why that's
terrible alright bye bomb sealed judo
monkey good morning everyone from Tokyo
not the first time seeing the video is
to in the lease for the first time here
in chat so good to see you nikki says
what how many said are you most excited
for that you have seen so far most
excited for probably the kat von d one
that looks like a wheel that one looks
really really cool

from trying not to interrupt you don't
have to be all secretive get what you
need I know but you can get what you

yesterday for pushback so she's just
getting her stuff so yeah just get that
stuff in you know it's all good all
right good anyway let's see so yeah so
the kat von d palette i'm really excited
about excited about the probe to the
mega Pro to buy little rock that one it
stands out in my mind is something I'm
really excited about I'm excited to see
something from Tarte you know tarts
tarts eyeshadow palettes have been hit
or miss for me but the ones that i've
swatched recently like them what is it
the tartlet palette looks amazing i
don't own it but i've swatched it and it
just seems amazing I've heard such good
things so I'm hoping that something from
torque comes out it's similar to that
I'm also looking forward to the
two-faced mini blushes because I don't
want to buy a full-size one I really
like to get some minis that would be
really cool the little heart shaped ones
so yes and I love you hear what other
people are excited about to thank you
what I love for leaving that from me
because you know you know I need that
she leaves me the card so that I can
edit the video uhhh let's see flaca says
can't wait for the Urban Decay vice I
might skip the by system i got device to
and that was kind enough for me I find
they're a little difficult to work with
as a complete palette as a whole so all
right sweetie hey my honey I'm not fat
my sweetheart all right wait you don't
in close the door and then the cat in so
the cashpoint any scratch me get out in
a minute but you know your nose one of

break from buying makeup because I'm in
the process of buying a new car yeah
congratulations or red car I have red
car too I love red car I actually know
what sections of buying a red car just
happened to be read when I got there
that's what they had so that's what I
got and I love my car
so that's very cool Nikki anyone been
bad today I got the Becca set already at
all too LOL i posted some really good
deals on the app this early in the
morning really there's a beka set on
hotel we should check it out together on
now though let's go let's go a little to
gather at the old website if said
there's some good deals I don't know
what happened to my phone as I was I
want to know my phone and chat for these
kinds of situations but let's go ahead
and look together at the Alta website
okay see if I remember how to do that
screen share okay and let's say okay
that's my youtube stuff ok let's go to
old off let's see these new deals whoo
so we've got the sparkle and shine by
Vegas nay it looks really really pretty
and long home Paris yeah okay and bare
minerals great complexion these are all
things we talked about today we're gonna
talk about the vegas next we talked
about that couple weeks ago but probably
should have talked about it again oh
there's the becca that's which I might
okay let's just look tart such a pretty
face I don't know that either oh well
okay so let's look here Mecca radiant
glow collection is what you're talking
about $32 what do you get you get an
under eye brightening corrector
shimmering skin Perfector preston
moonstone shimmering skin Perfector
press spotlight and opal beach tint lip
shimmer souffle and raspberry opal very
cool so that's what that looks like and
it's 32 bucks if you don't have that
stuff definitely I would say that looks
like it's totally worth it I do have a
pressed in opal and then i have the
spotlight and moonstone so I'll probably
skip this one because I have similar
things but I've always wanted to try the
beach tint I've never tried that so
there is that now let's take us off of
screen sharing stop what's up
okay bye then guys going to a gym it's
okay we were just looking at alta they
have some really cool sales on there
today hello what's happened makeup hello
hi okay fine thank you hey can we take a
viewer poll what we're coming into the
fall season they're called time on the
East Coast here and so my co-workers
have been trying to convince me to grow
a full beard how do we feel about that
let me feel about that I don't feel good
about that well beer you look too much
like your brother I'm not really feeling
it but they're saying that I should know
I don't think that'd be cool I like that
idea bye I have a good one we'll see if
anybody else feels like you should grow
a full beard we'll find out all right I
just wider bearded men or laterally
emery exam oh very nice her posh back
with us hey guys did you do my brush
your hair want to take your posh back
brush that you got in brush it real
quick okay that's fine that's okay all
right okay oh let me look actually now
that I'm thinking about let me look back
and see if there was anything else going
on as far as the sales because
supposedly they were a couple things
this benefit has a real sexy steel it
looks like a mascara and I'm Adam
remover and the eyeliner thingy so yeah
I'm not really excited about that just
because that eyeliner makes me irritated
the mascara is hard to get off I guess
if you get the remover to get it off but
oh no I don't know all right let's go
back to you guys you guys are important
instead of me just get our okay that's
cool Nikki that that set does a really
nice if you don't already have that
stuff that looks really nice it looks
like a very good deal LeAnn says the kat
von d I love the colors me too Alison
says Orion York Met commercials get to
me real path it wasn't Oreo commercial
before the show in case you missed that
oh my goodnes only 58 people here we got
a slow turn out today that's okay we
just hang on and they people are
watching the show Keyshia want to play
all right I'm talking about my Oreo
middle bowl I know right amazingness all
right Jen from Sarah yes I had the same
realization about the vib rouge dash
it's silly the biggest benefit is
probably free shipping I won't lie it's
fun to pull out that red card ah so what
I agree and and the thing about the free
shipping is now you pay ten bucks you
get free shipping I guess like a
year-long free shipping if you paid ten
bucks so I want to do that Chelsea good
morning Jen did you watch the next face
of words no I did not I stepped out of
that it was too much drama I don't like
drama in my life I don't watch things
that have drama in them I know that
there's some talented makeup things
going on but it was like I just couldn't
so I don't know I probably should catch
up on it because I noticed some amazing
makeup artists in there I should Lee
Anne says yes Nikki I saw I was thinking
about getting it and then I saw delta
Jacqueline Hill powder I was
disappointed so I didn't get it you were
disappointed in that Jacqueline pill
powder I'm surprised you're like one of
the few people i've heard hey Veronica
oh it's so good to see you Veronica is
one of my once we make up appt frequent
user she is amazing so so talented at
make up one of those things where I
think some people that make videos on
YouTube don't realize that some of the
people that watch videos just as good to
it make up as you are if not better
Veronica is one of those people like
Veronica Veronica and I had a makeup off
Veronica would beat me wait by far she's
amazing Oh many me she loved hear your
thoughts on the next fascia boards live
show last night was complete mess I
missed it see now I got watch it my
family left so maybe after a chat I'll
watch it is it what where do you find it
can you tell me where I find it i'm
assuming if i look up next phase of
where you'll find it but you have a
shortcut for me I'd appreciate that off
the check it out all right gents jenna
says is there anything you can do to try
to keep your makeup collection under
control I try to write everything 125
and then it's not a four or five I try
to pass it on or use it 55 times and
throw it yeah I mean I
think that with having a channel it's a
little well you have a channel to you
have to our channels make up new but by
the way an ewb make up any WB I think
what you have to do is you have to
decide what you're keeping for the
channel like what do you keep just
specifically for the chin like for
example i bought this kat von d crystals
was the chrysalis palette because it was
on sale and i wanted it for Duke
purposes I haven't used it yet because I
have all these other things that i'm
testing specifically for the channel i
got this just because i wanted to have
this palette and and it was so popular
so people are looking for these shades i
can say oh you know this this um you
know this shadow is an exact tube for
glass wing from the from the chrysalis
pals if you were really looking for that
you know what I mean so it's what are
you going to keep for the channel what
are you going to keep because you love
it and then what does it fit in either
of those categories there's no you don't
love it and you're not keeping it for
the channel and that's kind of where I
go I try not to do like number because
my brain will like tweak it the way that
I want it like that just doesn't work
for me it's cuz all like like this is a
30 but i really want to keep it now it's
a four you know so it's whatever system
works for you but I just try to justify
it in that way is it do i love it or is
it good for the channel anything else
gets passed along nikki i have the truck
nikki says i have to travel Oh poem rose
gold and like them but yes Jacqueline
hell was a letdown oh wow oh my goodness
that's sad um let's see Steph the palace
still available on FC the I was talking
about that i ordered the the palette
what is it though now I lost it though
oh my god it's really like went out of
my head the place that does all of the
UM the natural organic stuff oh my gosh
totally when I my head I got the blush
palette and you guys are probably
screaming at me so computer right now
what it is and I just went out of my
head so you gotta look it up real quick
cuz it's like I'll remember it starts
with j
and I can't remember what it is it's
removing me nuts judge I hate that one
my memory field me you gotta gotta feel
like I got up I went to bed about five
last night like actually went to bed I
was up and down a little bit with things
for for the show but I step stupidly on
it's not even start with a J its
polished choice idiot calling myself an
idiot its polished choice um but anyway
I went to bed at like five o'clock in
the morning and then when I woke up this
morning I forgot to plug in my computer
because i was so sleepy and my computer
died like three quarters of the way
through uploading the video so I'm a
little sleep but yes Paula's Choice
pallets yes it's still available which
is cool Krista hey Krista I remember
meeting you at imats I remember like
aren't you this person you were like no
I'm not that persico I hate that I hate
when I meet somebody I think somebody's
one but one person and they turned out
to be another person but I you know I
try but yes Krista I definitely remember
me and you and I mats um oh when the
chick stole the bag and my husband sasa
said something yeah there was a somebody
had left them and we weren't I Mets and
somebody had left their their purchases
sitting like by a counter and this woman
walks up and just like snags the bag and
starts walking away with it like all
shady so John went up to her and he's
like that's not yours and she was like
yeah it is he's like no it's not that's
not yours and basically told her that he
was gonna call security if she didn't
put the bag down is it wasn't nervous
she was just dealing it but Krista was
there for that too funny yeah mmm yeah
he was like a super hero that day all
right Karen good morning for Myrtle
Beach work in retail and this is the my
first sunday off in months he has a
participate lives so glad you're here
excited to see here what's new and
makeup ed oh no KJ says ebates says
eight percent cashback it's a for right
now
if you do not have a Bates he makes is
amazing like it's just like I told Lily
Lily Spurgeon who's one of my reporters
and a good friend of mine like it's like
free money when you shop online like
really and truly like it's not a scam or
gimmick or whatever like my last check
was like harder bucks from shopping
online and I don't know I guess maybe
they make out make a deal with a company
or something like if you click from
ebates and may give you dates my I don't
know I don't know how it works I don't
know why it works I just know that I get
a check every quarter and it's pretty
sweet and then the ebates app that you
can get and then you can go through the
app and then shop either on your browser
for the internet or on your apps like if
i click on ebay i can go to sephora app
and shop and it works and it's awesome
and if it depends it for every reason go
through you can email ebates and show
them your receipt and as long as you
access ebates and the link to that store
that day they'll give you the credit for
some reason it didn't work teammates is
pretty amazing and then when you get
referrals you get money so i think it's
like five dollars per referral so I
always put my referral link down
underneath my videos in case anybody
wants to sign up for it but I mean you
can just go to ebay so calm and sign up
for it but if people set up using your
link and get like five bucks straight up
to your account which is pretty awesome
that's why people have like ebates
contests and stuff because more quickly
get sign up and you get bonuses like 20
bucks and fifty bucks like you get two
people in a certain period of time or
whatever you need a lot of money that
way that's what people do that nikki
says I'm trying hourglass primer and
foundation samples today oh I'm liking
it so far oh no yeah which-which our
last um foundation is it is it the one
that I love is it my baby this is my
last baby this one here the Immaculate
liquid powder foundation yeah I love it
the primer I didn't think was
spectacular like I didn't feel like I
needed to invest in the primer but this
foundation is missing um but I'd love to
know which one you're trying where'sa
says Jedi just got for aqua lift offer
liquid lipsticks for twenty dollars from
FC I saw that and it was sold out I was
so sad I was like man because I probably
would have gotten that um but I hadn't
dawn in well to that particular part of
FC but that's pretty awesome Lee Anne
says I'm scared Nikki I didn't return
the Jacqueline hill and sucked up my
losses but I did but not but I'm not
going to spend money that won't stay on
my face by the time i drive to work and
then go on LOL oh no so you know you can
do Lee in if you don't have your receipt
and you really want to take it back you
can actually print out your transactions
online like when you buy something in
the store using your support account
hopefully you did if you brought it in
the store if you buy something online
you can print it out and take the
printout to sephora and they'll take it
as a return and because it's the back of
Jacqueline hell and they know they can
only get that at sephora i bet you even
if you don't have receipt they will
still give you store credit for that i
bet you they will so I mean that's a lot
of money to spend on something that you
don't even like girlfriend take that
back and if you don't take it back I
will take that for you if we would live
in the same area I would totally take
this forward for you and return it and
give you money like you got to take it
back if you don't like it or wake
goes out and then sell it on ebay I
don't know something but you got to do
something you can't just waste your
money on that um let's see em baby blue
Jen did you post the what's up in makeup
news video because I can't see it yes I
did it went up a little bit late and
what up about 15 minutes late but it
should be there it better be there
because I will cry if it's not there now
I feel I have to check it because now
I'm scared let me look because I'm
scared now because it had I edition
getting the video up yeah it's got a
bunch of use so it's definitely working
yep it's definitely working it's there
no no I don't know what's going on the
comp something's going on with the
comments though I don't know what's
going on for comments but it's
definitely working mmm
and you guys can see it right please
confirm confirm you can see it because
that would be terrible if for some
reason it did not um it was not working
that would make me cry but it looks like
it's working for me so try hit and
refresh and see if it's there whoo I
would not like that but it looks like
there's a lot of views on it so hoping
it's there alliston I've never heard I
never had good luck with you know
Jessie's Girl Jessie's Girl things I'm i
order not your mother she boarded the
not your mother's kit is that some good
cuz I've never tried any of the night
Ramona ship I haven't heard good things
about it but if you say it's good i will
change my opinion the Jessie's grown
nail polishes the julieg nail polishes
are kind of hit or miss but the I'm
telling you the liquid eyeliner is
amazing totally totally amazing the one
that's the pen Sarah says speaking of
ypsi on their brand offers they have
forty percent off cover effects that's a
great way to try their custom cover
drops i got mine for twenty bucks that
is really good to know I forgot what
shade i am i'm gonna have to look and
see what shade i am I have it somewhere
written down with shade I am but that's
a really great idea to get the cover FX
drops KJ is talking to Krista that's
same Leslie good morning from
Mississippi this is the first time my
daughter has allowed me to watch this
live so excited she's 14 months I
remember that girlfriend and I still get
in that point where you know my kid
don't allow me to do things it's like oh
my gosh it's not even worth trying not
even with Troy but yeah totally with you
girlfriend I'm so glad that you're here
Shannon's doesn't going to maine in
September I'm from Canada and I want to
make the most of my shopping time where
do you guys get Jessie's Girl and Nick's
products Jessie's Girl is really hard to
find I think it is it rite aid I think
it's rite aid 3 thing at jesse's girl
stuff but it's not at all rite aids or
this is it CBS I think it's rated see
now I got to look that up too just to
make sure um Jesse's girl um cosmetics I
got a pipe in cosmetic off the song
comes up Christina head Cassie's natural
find us in stores
we're gonna find a woman he'll hate not
you guys know that song I love that song
it's actually a really good song it's
rite aid so if you had the Justice girl
website you can see a list of where to
buy and see kind of where they have them
I think rite aid is it's just available
at select stores it's not available all
of them so I would honestly order the
Jessie's Girl stuff online that you want
and like my rite aid doesn't carry the
liners which is basically what i get
from them so and then Nix where's next
Knicks um excuse me at target they have
nicks and it will until they have nicks
those are the two places that I get
metrics underling full good morning my

hey jen is there a celebrity she wish
you had that you wish had a subscription
box mm-hmm that's an interesting
question a celebrity I wish had a
subscription box I'm really looking
forward to sephora subscription box I'm
hoping they rock it I'm rooting for them
I hope that it goes really well
personally I'm a big two-faced fan so if
to face had a subscription box I would
totally go for it I would totally even
if it was all like products that were
like going off their shelves I would
totally lit up i would i would pay for
some to face subscription box definitely
and don't really watch a lot of
television so I don't know a lot of
celebrities like i'm not good at that in
JLo had a subscription box though I will
be on it like on it yes but I don't know
I don't know a lot of current
celebrities I'm have time to watch TV um
I did start watching my netflix though
there's a show called sense aight i
finished the whole season oh my gosh
amazing very very violent though like
really violent like it gets more violent
as the show goes on like it starts off
relatively calm and then it gets the
dance like whoa that's pretty violent
and then it's a quote that's really
violent and then by the last episode
you're like this is like super violent
so but yeah I don't watch a lot of TV
but back to make up subscription box
j.lo and two-faced that was a great
question Sandra says loving the taste
cheek stain that may be the tart cheek
stain has just got another yesterday
with the dry skin fine lines or taste
cheek stains private tort ones because
we were we were shopping with those with
dry skin and fine lines around my eyes a
cream blush you look much better than
any powder press blush I've tried so if
you have dry skin Sandra says the tart
cheek stains they're the ones that are
like the roll-up kind i think there's
the ones you're talking about girlfriend

was eyeing that the ball and powder from
my Birchbox points LOL uh-huh it's nice
it's definitely nice but I mean it's
dark let me swatch it for you so you can
see it's pretty dark like it's dark and
I think the only make one shade like is
dark so just so you know I mean it does
blend out so you can definitely kind of
build it if you're um or if you can kind
of blend it out if you're have lighter
hair but yeah you might just try some
eyeshadow first and see how that works
save yourself a couple bucks and if that
doesn't work this really is a nice brown
powder but it made a blended out pretty
nice to a nice to me color know maybe
it'll work for you try to see if you can
find somebody on youtube that has
lighter hair that used it all right

thank you i think so too and baby blue
anyone try the new burberry fluid base
yet i want to but i want wait i want it
but I want to hear some opinions about
it first are you talking about the one
that's in the burberry kid if so don't
use it with a silicon-based foundation
because that did not work very well the
fresh glow I only use it the one time I
used it before filming yesterday and
yeah accidentally mixed it with a it's a
water-based primer or bass or whatever
and and I mixed it with a silicone
foundation and it broke up all of my
face and was a terrible experience but
when i use this properly i can let you
know hopefully I have enough in here for
a few uses because this thing is teeny
tiny it's point 17 fluid ounces so
hopefully I have enough
to use it a few times but yeah I can't
give you a an opinion on that I have a
full video on the what's on my face
video I thought what's up makeup website
if you want to see me talking about how
much I failed on using this um I feel
like a mind like dragging I feel like
I'm more like I'm trying to keep my
energy up um maybe she says I hope the
next doors are a success I want when
they're mean okay see Jenny says she's
interested in the burberry foundation
Nikki's talking about how she loves
ebates she got sixty dollars last

mm-hmm it's awesome jane austen says
she's waiting for her burberry box to
come it's it's a it's fun to use I mean
I don't know if it's worth thirty bucks

makeup addict it's worth thirty bucks
but the products are small they really
are small Leslie said just download the
app excited to play around you that you
a welcome to our community Leon says
self just released the seven new
lipstick shades got the email now for
the fall 00 for the father new lipsticks
yes because they met their goal there
10,000 subscriber bowl or whatever
mm-hmm it looked very nice to Krista
says it's so annoying because people
always think it's like too good to be
true I have numerous friends who shop
online so much but won't sign up for
ebates they think it's like a scam or
something I know people don't believe it
because just doesn't seem right you know
like they're gonna they're gonna sell
your email address or something but it's
really pretty amazing Elise says she
loves ski beach too and then Lee Ann
says I was shopping at sephora yesterday
for a new foundation why is the lighting
so crappy and makeup store suck it's
hard to see sometimes definitely totally
agree Regina says are you excited to go
back to school I am I am because I'm
back in my old job being special
educator and resource teacher that's
like my thing that's my forte so I'm
excited to be back in that I really
liked teaching fourth grade for two
years I love the kids that's of course
the best part is getting you know the
case I got to teach a class of Advanced
Learner's last year and
they were just amazing they taught me so
much just the way that they think is
just so amazing like just oh my gosh
just it was fun to see where their
brains went and I had never taught a
class like that before and it was so
interesting and I would not trade that
for the world and of course all the
other students that I talked to I mean
they all teach me so much so I mean it
just it was amazing it was an amazing
experience teaching fourth grade for two
years but it's not my thing that I'm the
best I'm the best at special educational
resource so I'm happy to be back in that
job and now that i am i'm very excited i
was i was a little nervous going back to
being a fourth grade teacher just
because I don't feel one hundred percent
confident in it um but I feel confident
on a job that I do so you know so I am
excited fizzy pop says good morning good
morning to you nikki says yes she likes
the hourglass liquid powder foundation
one it's yes it's a liquid if we're
talking about which which foundation she
got a sample of and she was saying that
it's this one I don't like liquid found
and I don't like looking foundation so I
do like liquid foundations but I really
like this one Shannon says I was
skeptical if he dates until Jen
recommended it i know she recommends it
it's legit well it's true i would never
like steer you to something that's not
legit you guys know that treat others
the way you would like to be treated
right I'd say Leon says is an hour of
drive back bring it back to sephora oh I
would bring him for you if I could

day job you hairspray not sure if um if
she likes the actual product of just the
smell good to know people talking about
Jessie's Girl and where to find it rite
aid some people said walgreens but
raiding does have it they have a better
selection Tanya says Jen have you ever
tried the coulomb makeup setting spray I
haven't I just got in my Birchbox and
I'm loving it wondering how it compares
the urban to get urban decay um I don't
know UD chill I don't know you need
chill I know i'm assuming urban decay
they don't know chill but yeah i don't
know I've never tried the cool one but
that's good to know that it's awesome
because I have some birchbox points that
I'd like to use to buy things so that
would be a good thing Lee Anne says Nick
stuff is best to get it all to online
usually they got they got they buy one
get one half off mm-hmm they're makes
sale right now as you speak that's
really good to know Leon yeah um if
you're looking at buying some mixed
stuff that they have a sale right now
and also really i mean the selection of
ulta is way bigger than my target so i
usually get next stuff at all so that's
thank you for mentioning next I was even
thinking about that Florrie is talking
about how awesome ebates is I know I've
got about four hundred dollars and money
so far Christmas is a great time to rack
up ebates money that's true we got our
televisions that when we were buying a
new TV we went through ebates first and
got like 150 bucks back something like
that because there was a whatever
percent um cash back on the website
where we bought it so we got like a lot
of money back on our TV that was pretty
amazing Nikki going to have to get had
Jessie's Girl stuck in my head because I
was singing it it is a good song Chelsea
I want to make up know by four
my mom checked my bank account so i
spent over two hundred dollars on
Jordana elfin colour-pop that's a lot of
products to be 0 the sexy one two
dollars on Jordana elephant color Bob
it's like I went shopping with with
Sandra ever in our local mall Sandra
still here I went shopping and I don't
sat down and I looked and I was like I
spent that much money on these like five
things because like the brush that I got
I think this was like a fifty-dollar
brush I just splurged and it was like
you know looking there I'm like how much
money would i just spend you know
because i got like high-end stuff but i
can only imagine how much product you've
got from Jordanna elephant colour-pop
with two hundred dollars that's like an
entire makeup arsenal that's amazing so
I really it's one of these things is
like you know you have 200-dollars of
that stuff you could probably chill out
on the manga for a while you probably
plenty of things you try you know Anna
Kanye says her rite aid does not carry
Jessie's Girl and I don't think all of
them do let's see uh you don't know me
says she gets Knicks at her local
African American hair store um yeah
there's like the private Lake the
private boutiques and things a lot of
times they'll sell makeup of different
brands and i have found exit those on
special beauty outlet places okay I'm
just going to skip down a bit because I
want to get to some other things before
we have to go in about ten minutes or so
just mostly talking about Nick's flory
says we'll chat good I want to I want to
fix this problem with your with the app
because you're the first person to come
up with that so we have to fix it she's
having issues posting pictures on the
app which is not good because flory
needs to be in the community on the app
Jackie says my comments never get red I
don't get it I don't know what happened
where are you doing at and then my name
or putting my name in capital letters
because i don't know how i missed it I
was skipping down a bit so it's possible
that I may have met missed something
that you wrote Jackie but i'm not doing
it on purpose i promise i don't know
what happens Fort Worth famous says
there is a crop feature when you try to
upload a picture bigger than 10 it works
on my phone
I have an Android okay mmm free out okay
Florian I'll have to work that out I use
an app for Instagram pics I'm going to
get the pics to fit in the what's of the
makeup appt okay so nikki says to
download look I have I wish I have my
phone with me for the what to make about
if you're having trouble uploading
pictures to crop them to Instagram size
so I have what is it picstitch picstitch
i think is one of them where it will let
you crop them to Instagram sighs and
then you save those to your phone that's
a pain in the butt though you must be on
Android because my apple product i just
upload whatever picture like a screencap
and I take pictures of things and I
upload them straight to the app and it's
fine but if you feed it through one of
those maybe it'll work mmm I'm sorry
about that ok and then steph says
instasize app on your phone and resizes
the picture that's good to know Jackie
says she's coming on computer so that's
good because you're saying and I'm not
reading your comment I don't know what
happens i don't know how i miss your
comment I'm sorry make sure you put jet

beard on the Facebook page if you're

have you tried the Milani amore matte
lip creams I haven't she says they're
amazing oh my gosh well there are Brandt
they're back on the Milani website now I
feel like I need to get some and I feel
like I need to get some because I heard
they're back on the website KJ says love
sense8 hopefully they're coming out with
a season 2 i'm assuming they are because
they left it with a big cliffhanger at
the end Nikki are you utd with update
with pretty little liars I just watch
list episode last night oh my goodness
yes I watched all of them I ended up we
don't have cable anymore because you
don't feel the need to purchase it since
we don't watch a lot of TV so I actually
went on amazon prime and bought the
second half of season six so that I
could watch the rest of pretty little
liars actually purchased it I was
personally am a 299 a dollar ninety nine
dollar ninety-nine episode the light of
couldn't wait until it was on that
flicks I had to know what happened and
it was an OMG moment at the end of those
ten episodes for pretty little liars
season 6i Nikki nope Flaccus Lance
talkin to Nicki oks Sanyasi bought a
perfume from Ulta just to get that
weekender bag they're offering I want
the gray one ooh we'll have to check
that out I don't buy perfume anymore
because I have set bird Sanford is
amazing anything I wanted I think I want
to wear any perfume that I want I just
get through semper my leopard link is
down below i'm not doing i'm not saying
that just because my links down below
just go to semper com if you want to but
they get the little mini perfumes or
whatever do I have any over here
so i usually keep them like right here
there you go Oh only sunset bird hi this
is the box but not aware cricket is open
on the floor or because when I film I
can't have anything on my desk so I just
take whatever i usually keep on my desk
and I just put on the floor it's
terrible i know i need to get like
shelving and stuff in here I've just
been procrastinating but anyway this is
Georgie or ma ani see this was my um my
roller ball for this not rollerball but
my roller both sides perfume for this
month and it really really like it a lot
but it's 15 bucks a month and I get to
try all kinds of perfume because I never
go through a whole one of these I still
haven't gone through I've been this is
probably my six or seven said bird and I
still haven't gone through a single one
completely so what's the point of me
getting the entire bottle for 90 bucks
if I'm not even to go through a
rollerball sighs you know so I'm happy
with my semper and that's why I don't
buy perfumes in stores but the weekender
bag i'll have to check that out because
I bet it's awesome and you're gonna make
me get a perfume if I want the back all
right you don't know me says time to go
have a great day see on facebook later
see you later oh alright let's see
people talking to each other which makes
me happy Oh Sarah says I should have a
subscription box no the only way I would
ever do a subscription box would be if
boxy charm wanted to do it with me
that's the only way I would trust it is
if the owner of boxy times I've talked
to him on the phone before if he was
like hey Jen you want to do a
subscription box me I would be like yes
I will totally do it but no way am I
just going with some random company like
I don't even know like poor melissa
melissa Raymond have you seen like her
subscription box people were not happy
with the first month of her subscription
box when she put out she's partnered
with real style and I was afraid that
was going to happen because I'm room for
Melissa I want Melissa to do so well I'm
all good things to happen to her I love
her I'm Melissa Autry I was colored most
agreement Melissa Autry I want good
things to happen to her and I was so sad
they had the subscription box did not
live up to the expectations that people
it ordered it and that's why I would
never do a subscription box unless I
know that I can
hundred percent trust the people that
are putting the products in there or if
I have say over them because it's like
how how do you even get products for a
subscription box how do you even order
them and get that have connections with
companies in order to get products for
subscription boxes like you have to have
a good base of subscribers and even in
order for companies to probably consider
even putting things in your box so how
do you even get started like how does it
even happen i don't i don't get it i
don't know i mean i guess that's why
every single subscription box that I've
ever subscribed to from the jump as
always has had growing pains AFC was had
some issues in the beginning boxy charm
definitely was completely different box
in the beginning um you know so I don't
know unless it was through an existing
it like if Birchbox was like hey Jen you
want to collaborate and do a separate
subscription box I'll be like yes but I
just it would have to be like I would
have to guarantee there could be some
good stuff in there like I'm not even
i'm not even taking the chance of people
spending their money and then getting a
bunch of stuff that they don't feel like
it's worth it you know what I'm saying
but anyway oh I really would like that
one day but I doubt that's gonna happen
just because I'm so picky let's say um
there's never a reason hey Jen its
Rebecca McQueen hello so good to see you
i wanted to relieve but normally I
global family had a computer so good to
see you my dear oh my gosh it's 1107 or
hitting me all right I'm gonna stay on
one until 11 15 and then I got to cut it
off so that'll give us another couple of
minutes Oh buddy good to see you Rebecca
yeah um okay I'm about to lose my space
Florrie says JLo is my woman crush you
and me both girlfriend ok it's about to
skip down so hopefully I don't lose it
too far ok they're talking about the
deal at Ulta for the perfume let me say
okay I got to find my spot again
where I was so that I go in order I try
to go in order because I don't like to
feel like somebody feels like they're
not being seen so that really hurt made
me sad that the one person said she felt
like I wasn't reading her comments there
we go I'm back where I'm at I just like
that's the most fair way to do it it
just start at the beginning and work my
way down people talking to each other
which makes me happy Sammy says ladies

tough time in my life give me a really
long time to feel comfortable in my own
skin um I took it really until not

anybody on purpose and that I made
decisions that were good for me and the
people that I love and the world and all

there the comments are always so
positive i know i know i'm so glad that
you i'm saying i know about the the
comments excuse me but yes the EDD thank
you so much i'm really glad you're
enjoying the app and i was talking to my
friend Jane over the plainest Jane and
she's talking about how Instagram
they're such a you know like a pressure
to be perfect to have that everything
just perfection and that was kind of one
of my goals of the community is just for
everybody to feel comfortable posting
their looks no matter what they look
like what their skill level is what
their comfort level is with makeup I
want everybody feel comfortable posting
their pictures and if we you know if you
ask for advice people will give you
advice but I mean it's a really positive
place to be and it's very encouraging
you know everybody's everybody
understands that there is everyone
starts somewhere with makeup and it
takes practice to get good at it I mean
I'm still learning so much and I you
know I watch a lot of YouTube videos and
I have my channel on everything but I
don't do tutorials for a reason because
I don't feel like I am skilled like that
with makeup um it's just not you know I
still practice like I'm still practicing
I'm still learning and I feel like I'm
pretty good at it but I don't feel like
I'm up to par with a lot of people on
Instagram and on youtube so the app is a
great place for me to post things that I
don't feel comfortable posting on
Instagram for everybody in the world to
judge you know what I'm saying
so yes I'm so glad you're enjoying it
Lisa as much as I enjoyed I like it too
