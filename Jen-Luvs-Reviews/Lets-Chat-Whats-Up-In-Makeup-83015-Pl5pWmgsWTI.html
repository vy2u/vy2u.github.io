cute okay uh-uh you singer says I'm not
stressing I'm more worried that you
don't know where Italy is LMAO yeah that
was a joke I hope people realize in the
bloopers I do realize that Italy and
France or different countries like it
was a total joke like I almost didn't
include it but I thought it was funny so
I'm hoping people get that I'm like
making fun of myself for thinking that
it's how I n was French and you're
thinking George iolani was french so but
anyway so hopefully people got that I
know you got that yesenia but I don't
know if other people got and I'm
crossing my fingers you'll don't think
I'm stupid enough to think that France
and Italy are the same place its Frances
city in Italy uh but anyway um let's see
Nikki's talk my getting a better for
server for anastasi I did that cost
money to have like a beefed-up server I
don't know I would imagine it does good

slice so fun welcome to you Aaron and
nikki says did you know did you hear not
everyone will got there fifty dollar
credit there a ton of people who didn't
they have until the first no I didn't
make it there what did everybody get
their credits you think that would have
put them all on a big list and hit send
to all and then like hiding you know
what I mean he'll like you behind people
i don't know i don't know if that was
like they'll be like unsafe or something
i don't know i don't know the ins and
outs of why they do what they did but
people ever that really is weird that
not everybody got their fifty dollars
for the credit if you know if you don't
know what happened for the sephora if
you tried to get the rewards and then
you didn't even email and say hey i
didn't get my epic reward i couldn't get
it and then they sent an email with a
special code for fifty dollars fifty
dollar credit toward looks like so

back to the chat ok once i see what's on
there then I'll see whether i think that
um that i'll get anything or not we'll
sing like i say before I kind of like
maxed out on new products right now dawn
hello hi Jen what six makeup products
you can't live without ok let's get in
these drawers here ok six makeup
products I can't live with out on the
just in general or specific one was
specifically specifically mascara I love
women scare my mascara makes me happy
and of course I can't find the one that
I was looking for only on the floor is i
use to yesterday no I don't know Oh
we'll just show you things that I could
find guys I mean really there's no
makeup that I seriously cannot live
without like as far as a specific
product like this particular Brianna's
trigger product like I can't live
without it like I don't have any
replacements for it but some of my
favorite things that I i feel like i
used regulate oh here we go this was
mascaras looking for this is my little
girl
scary right now Maybelline lash
sensational not even kidding wave of
every other mascara that I own I love
this mascara more than any IM mascara
that I've ever tried this is my favorite
so that's 10 to favorite highlighter no
no I'm going to say my becca opal
because i have to do cuz i do for them
the do penis with my colored papas to do
i also love my Mary Lou so I'm not even
gonna say but that's the candle without
because I can use those interchangeably
I mean is like really like I'm around I
don't think i have six the thing is is
like if i don't have one then i could
just reach for another one that's
similar you know um but I could tie just
some things that I really like the
Jessie's Girl eyeliner pen eyeliner i
love but i interchange that with the kat
von d eye liner in trooper and the Stila
stay all day eyeliner those are all
interchangeable to me but i have had at
least one of those so we'll say that's
too and we'll say the the trifecta of
either marry low or wisp bicolor pump or
lunch money by color pop or opal by
becca so one of these for my shading too
bad here that would be three for blush
say um where's my order like a von d
blush in Essex I would cry if something
ever happened to this because it's
discontinued open it this is this is my
favorite of all time of all time that is
discontent so that's 44 so I gotta get
some more two more years for a shadow oh
well I shadow I can't live without
palette still pal here come on you have
a pass on my box Walker shirt
this is the thing with eyeshadow I can
always find other eye shadow there isn't
a single palette that I own that I would
say I can't live without there's things
i'd be sad if I lost nothing that I'd
say I can't look out I am very thankful
to have this this is my baby i love this
the lorac mega Pro the original but I
mean there's lots of bouncing at all I
don't know but do I have to use this now
I have to use this so I can't even say
that oh I would say oh this is good you
know either the mac paint pot painterly
or my Myka PDI primer that would be fine
and then one word more to foundations so
interchangeable to me like I don't care
okay no this right here where is it why
not even in here the Revlon just bitten
kissable balm stain and honey that is
like my go-to I don't know what lipstick
going where I wearing this it's probably
in my car because I love it oh no he's
right here Yeah right here here we go my
friends right there pinky nude
perfectness this is my perfect color
it's my favorite above it see how i'm
hit the six yeah i did it oh thank you
doing for the question I appreciate it
KJ I wonder what they consider prestige
anything on anything that's on high
inside so all the stuff on the drugstore
side you're good anything on the high
end side you're not that's what they
call prestige over ulta oh let's see
okay Ally to jen and everyone what are
some good lip primers i bought the Urban
Decay ultimate ozone and I'm not a fan I
heard great things about the Nixon
Milani but sadly I'm Canadian okay I
tried the ozone and I found that I used
it twice and i had to sharpen it and
then I lost my sharpener so I did not
use the
aniston um you know what I really like
it's not lip primer but the lip
exfoliator by elf is amazing i love that
thing love that man um I don't use lip
primers I use lip balms as a primer i
use lip balm is there a difference
between the lip balm and lip primer
really and truly is a lip primer just an
overpriced lip balm because that's what
I feel like am I the only one that
thinks that I would love to know what
you think or let primary source
overpriced lip balms as ayesha's lip
balms I don't know if you feel like
you've got a lip lip primary that works
better than a lip balm I would love to
know about it love to know about it
please tell me because I need to try it
I need to see what the magical mists is
all about uh um Sammy let's see 21 days

Christie Christie nice strong good
morning to you my dear and Leanne does
jen or anyone have a recommendation for
a light foundation I'd be using marc
jacobs jeans shell and I like it except
it doesn't cover any of my redness is
almost empty so I'm on the hunt a light
foundation meaning a lightweight
foundation have you tried CC creams and
making crepes because that is the kind
of one by stick with I found that for
work I'm not enjoying a foundation for
work I feel like when I go to work I
don't want to have the even medium
coverage because my skin right now is
doing re I don't need a whole lot of
coverage so things i'm using for life
foundation from work let's say this time
freeze by lou mean the CC anti-aging CC
cream i really like this this is a
drugstore product also the Garnier BB
cream is really good I don't know if you
were looking for a foundation foundation
is light coverage one that I I think so
much or Sandra took it when she was here
or not but I gave it away it is the bare
skin no not fair skinned knee um Sandra
wasn't she took the box up shows some
skin foundation I really like that
moment that one I don't think that's
going to happen any coverage at all it's
very
very light coverage I barrels bare skin
if you're looking for something because
this one's buildable so that way you can
use it and I build it up to whatever you
need so this might be a really good one
for you just because it did really
nicely used in a while I can feel like
it needs to be shook it up but um but
yes you know what this is the one I
would probably recommend for you because
then you know you can build it up where
you need it and then not build it up
where you're good you know what I'm
saying that's my recommendation I have
bear show by the way it's my shade just
so you know that's my recommendation and
then Krista says I also tagged you on
Instagram because do you see Maybelline
has a new brown pellets called brow
drama contains wax powder and highlight
four shades excuse me I'll email you
next time yeah email me next time
because that's like where I look mostly
for supper what's makeup excuse me um I
think I might have reported on that
before the Maybelline brow palette brow
drama I think I might have reported on
that a week or two ago I'm not sure i'll
have to look back and then let's see
steph where it has before sending these
emails out i was lucky and I got my 50
bucks but it's cool how they're jerking
it's not cool how the jerking people
around still I'm feeling they're not
trying to jerk people around I have a
feeling that they might have run out of
cold or something like that um they're
also been something like they generated
X amount of codes and they didn't
generate enough or they're not trying to
crash that system or I'm sure there's a
logic behind it I wouldn't imagine there
were there doing that on purpose that
wouldn't be smart of them I can't
imagine they would just do that just to
jerk people around you know um let's say
fizzy pop if you're really pale you you
should order Korean foundations of BB
creams because they come in later colors
yes I have heard good things i have
added the leo le BB cream to my cart on
amazon like 15 times i've never gotten
at cuz i hear such I've heard such good
things about I mean for years it has
been in my cart for years I think Laura
foot mrs. Lowell it was the one that
talked about it i think back in the day

really long time but I remember that was

continue your conversation without me
reading it out loud Krista did you see
um do you see sugar pop is giving us a
two-faced brow and the oh not sugar pop
pop sugar can I read um popsugar is
giving us a two-faced brow and the in
September in the silver box I saw that
and you know what Sandra and I were
talking about that yesterday she's like
looking at my stuff she's like where's
the brow and be like where she's like in
a story looking I don't it man what do

work my way down I take my time I have
to if you're just coming in and you're
commenting I am way behind so I'm just
going right in
order of when the comments came in so
I'm coming in where Natalie came in good
morning to you Natalie and Shannon any
idea around what month holiday sets are
coming out october i would rather save
my fifty dollar support credit for one
of those but it expires the end of sep
tember what I would do if I were you is
I would wait until maybe the second look
right before it expires because there
may be some coming out at the end blast
we can sep tember but i would imagine
most of them start rolling out beginning
of october i think they did that on
purpose I think that was intentional
that they know that all the Holly says
coming out in October stay n to the
theater September I mean that was a
smart move of them no smart I give them
give him props for that business wise
I'm sad about it gets by holiday stuff
with mine but I give him props for it so
he can hold out I would hold out if I
were you and see till the end of the
month Lee an urban decay in 53.5 is good
for light coverage and I oh are you
talking about the Urban Decay the light
the they're weightless foundation
whatever they call it they're lighter
foundation forget what it's called off
the top of my head I can't remember and
yeah just giving um foundation advice

sweet she talked about it in chat the
end of chat last week she said she was
going to send it to me and she did and I
felt like thumb on the floor I could not
believe it so i am going to be sending
her something back because i think I
have something for her that I have in
mind I just have to ask her if she
thinks it'll work for her before i send
it but um but yeah it wasn't the easiest
thing for me to work with the first time
that I used in so I'm gonna have to play
with it a little bit and thank you tyler
for giving me advice under the video i
really appreciate that Florrie good
morning to you i'm so glad that you're
here sandra haha my gray eyelashes eddie
i use yeah rapid lashes when i was
talking about it's like
pet cemetery if it's dead you try to
bring it back to life you never know
what you're gonna get that's so true
that's so true it's like oh my gosh you
said it best I can't even like elaborate
on that it's true but I do love my rapid
lash I do I haven't used in a while
especially since I had my eye issues
because that gel um I drew cops that I
had made my eyes all goopy and it was
like blue but it really helped my eyes
so I can't complain but I need to go
back to you using my rapid lash but I
haven't used it since we moved so gotta
go back I like my rapid lash but once
you stop using it then it goes back to
regular so funny pet cemetery okay
Boston Barbie doll what do you use for
your videos hard drive portable I heard
WD is good how many terabytes girlfriend
oh no i don't know i can show you my
camera Sandra was like that's your
camera that's what you use because it's
just a little time frame she's right
here so this is my process hopefully
this is interesting to more than just
like one of you and actually here's my
here's my memory card I have a sand desk
and it doesn't even say just as sandisk
adapter and it doesn't even say like how
many whatever gigabytes or whatever on
here so what I do is I just record on
this and then I put it in my computer
and I save it to my computer and then I
edit it and then I delete the raw
footage so i don't use any kind of like
like hard drive or anything to store all
of my old footage i just deleted what I
ran a room like on my computer I go from
all this stuff to the newest stuff and I
just delete the raw footage I do keep
the final videos I just delete the raw
footage except for the raw footage of my
kids I keep the videos like when I land
I do posh pack and stuff I keep those
videos but other than that I just delete
them so I don't use a hard drive I do
have one but it's a one terabyte hard
drive but I don't I don't use it really
that much I mostly use that to store
like family pictures and things so I
don't even know like what WD is
I'm not it's a key person I'm sure that
um you know knurling full 10 she's my
techie interpreter yes but yeah that's
how that's how I work it I just delete

another dimension oh because that was
when I was um when it was like I was
going to the Alta website and it was

showing multiple screens over multiple
screens I know right very weird okay
what's Leanne talking about here it says
a 2415 purchase 1395 I don't know what
you're talking about what is that I
don't know what you're talking about oh
yeah because I was just having issues
with my display so I'm going to skip
past anything that people are like
helping me with my husband I'm Natalie
says anyone seen the Makeup Forever
holiday set yet I think we've seen some
sneak peeks of that I'm pretty sure we
have I'm not sure I'm getting lost in
all the sneak peaks that I'm looking out
like I can't even remember what's what
but I'm sure they're gonna be coming now
is stop the girlfriend I'd have to look
back at my stuff to see Oh Lee Anne says
I feel like I need to smack my hand
battle you're talking I need a snack my
hand battle must be like an autocorrect
I don't know what you're talking about
all right okay you guys are just talking
about things okay Charlotte says I
should be studying right now but this is
way more interesting Thanks I remember
those days man just last summer was when
I was finishing my master's degree and
it was like kids were out flying kites
with my husband at the beach and I was
at the mcdonalds using the Wi-Fi I
totally i'm with you studying is not fun
most of the time Nikki why wish you luck
on your studying I hope you do well um
but I'll be here to help you
procrastinate for a while Nikki I got
the ad early since i placed an order it
came in my box I don't think many people
got the mailer yet unless they posted it
today okay that's good to know about the
oldest sale Krista i really want to
start youtube but i'm having problems
editing and being nervous awkward for
the camera do you have any advice or
anyone who does youtube I think it's
just one of those things where you just
have to practice you know you just have
to like I've always been like a camera
person like I've always been comfortable
I did like the morning announcements in
my high school I was at middle school p
remember middle school in middle school
where it was a TV studio kind of
situation where we had like a DJ booth
and everything and I was like one of the
newscasters online for middle school so
I was in plays in high school and stuff
so I never really had went through that
where it was awkward in front of the
camera like I was never me so I don't
know I didn't really have to go through
that I don't imagine just pretending
like you're talking to a friend you know
just looking at that camera and just you
know like I'm looking at the camera i'm
looking at a camera but I'm like I'm top
I know I'm talking to people you know so
I try to just kind of keep that in mind
that people are my audience and friends
are my audience so you gotta relax and
then just get to the point you know like
figure out what you're going to say like
okay I'm going to talk about this chart
lip palette and the packaging is
beautiful and I know i'ma talk about the
packaging i know i'm going to talk about
i'm gonna swatch the shadows i know i'm
going to you know maybe you some brush
watches maybe show a look you know like
and kind of have a basic plan of what
you're going to do before you start so
you don't end up ugly around a whole lot
and then editing thing honestly like I
would recommend getting editing software
like like like TS and editing software
you could get older versions of good
editing software that's just as good for
we do as the new stuff so go on find out
what the latest version of the editing
software you want whatever works for
your computer and then go on Amazon and
find older versions of it and then buy
it for a fraction where price so if like
for example the editing software that I
use the newest version i think it's like
three or four hundred dollars but you
get the version that i use like 50 bucks
on amazon i use sony vegas and i think
this is version 11 but 1111 is not good
don't get 11 get 10 if you can get Ted
ten was awesome 11 is terrible but now
it's like the new versions ridiculous
but we're not making movies here we're
just making YouTube videos so you like
to get the latest greatest version of
editing software but I would definitely
recommend editing software definitely
because it makes life a lot easier you
can do a lot more it's less frustrating
in the end so much easier so hopefully
that helps Krista and if you definitely
when you make your new tube channel
because when you make youtube channel
you're going to let me know so that I
can cheer you on and subscribe to your
channel okay so make sure you tell me um
let's see Leon saying she thinks that
it's pure minerals the brand that she's
saying is the Duke for the door air
flash I believe and lets him scrolling
down past conversations okay here's one
for me Christie um Jen I've been
enjoying the app so funny i am so glad
you've been liking the app Christie I
haven't been on there a whole lot lately
because of work and everything I'm
trying to at work kind of get myself
super organized so that I have less work
to do through the year so that's why
videos are kind of slow right now I'm
trying to put up at least one video
besides what's up and make up ideally I
want to put up to really I would love to
put up three in a week besides what's at
the makeup but right now I'm just trying
to get my feet wet and my job make sure
that I've got that taken care of because
really and truly those children are my
number one priority like I can't put
youtube above their education and what I
owed them is their teachers so um so
that comes first and that's why videos
are a little bit slow and people yell at
me for not putting up videos it's like
dude I do have a full-time job and I'm
dealing with the lives of children
that's kind of more important than me
putting up an extra video you know what
I'm saying so I'm but I can't explain
that to people
you know like I understand you know you
want me to put more cards on content up
and I'm grateful and thankful that you
like me and off that you want me for
more content up like that makes me so
happy that people want to see more
contact content for me but when people
get mad at me like it's like to come on
give me a break man like I'm shaping
molding young minds here you know so so
yeah I mean I I definitely want to put
out more videos and I want to be on the
app more I want to be on the at more and
now we've got the forum and I haven't
even been over to quite yet at the
what's of a makeup website lily and I
have been talking about doing a podcast
forever I'm there's so many projects
that I want to do there just aren't
enough hours in the day so I'm glad that
there is now a strong solid community
over on the app that you guys can kind
of you know take the reins on that and
go with it and I can just kind of pop by
whenever I can so so yeah I'm really
glad you're enjoying it because the
people over there really are super nice
I mean like people of all skill levels
are posting their pictures and it's just
it's beautiful to see people comfortable
that may not be you know working maybe
they haven't been using makeup for
really long time and they still feel
comfortable posting their pictures in
the app and that makes me my heart so
happy so so happy like i just i love
that that we can be such a wonderful
community over there so i'm really glad
you're enjoying the app yay okay I have
to move on from there because I can talk
about the app forever because i'm just
so i'm so happy about it it's not
perfect but it's a really great place
nikki says is the third post down from
the sales and deals events page okay are
you talking about the UM the Ulta
website let me see I still have it open
I don't know man i'm not gonna spend
more time on that I'll look at it later
I'll just look at it later I'll find it
don't look at it later okay oh here we
go Boston Barbie dolls giving advice on
youtube channel she says most important
be yourself and genuine hundred percent
agree hundred percent agree absolutely
too many people trying to be other
people absolutely Leon says Maybelline
mascara reminds me a Duke of the benefit
mascara the new one did you guys see
that
the episode the new crazy mascara for
Maybelline with the like crazy spikes oh
my gosh but they're like crazy looking
spikes there's scary spikes the benefit
mascara doesn't have crazy spikes like
it's really not bad let me see if I can
get it out so I have it here the roller
lash I think it's what you're talking
about and my room there we go the roller
lash i think is what you're talking
about this does not have crazy spikes
like that like that's that's like you
know reasonable looking spikes the
Maybelline one that thing is scary I
think I need to see in person though
it's like the spikes like look like mail
like this it's weird i was having
trouble making that for a second let me
um yeah it's scary i don't even know i'm
curious to see some other people um some
of the some people reviewing and see how
it goes all right let me see okay nikki
says I'm broke down and got I broke down
and got the lorac contour palette but 10
times points sold me oh my gosh that's
the one like I want so bad but it's like
I don't need it I have so many contour
cowlitz like I don't need another one I
just got the honest nozzle would I
forget why I got this there was a reason
why I got where did it go where are you
but like contour palette okay I got the
Smashbox 1 i've got the kat von d 1 i've
got the city color 1 i've got the elf
one i bought the Anasazi or one
somewhere oh here it is and I got the
honest on to one like why do I need I
mean what who in their right mind needs
five contour palette who needs six
contour palette sounds the question me
because I'm an addict and I want all the
contour palettes and I want the lorac
one even though I'm not gonna get it but
then you know I've got you know highly I
got highlighters I got Rogers hope and
then I almost don't count this as a
contour palette but I've also got this
this one this is the company need to use
this for a contour palette this is the
crucial sense Eclipse palette that I got
I think it a boxy charm or something
I've been meeting try to use this for
like cream contour trying that out but I
haven't what it's like girlfriend I need
to knock it off with the contour palette
is stupid at this point it's just stupid
but I need to go
to use all of this makeup all right
anyway okay uh let's see I'm trying to
find people that aren't talking to each
other okay some things I'm not quite
understanding what's happening here all
right Natalie there we go are you going
to use the mech going to get the lorac
mega Pro to I haven't decided yet that's
one of those that i may have to get
because it would just look so pretty
next to my other one you know like this
is like i love this baby i love this
baby i might have to get it i think i'm
gonna have to put my fingers in it first
go to hold up my fingers in it see if i
want it i'll probably end up getting it
if i'm going to get any of the the
holiday pallets it would probably be the
mega pro 2 and the on Kat Von D those
are the two that are like really calling
to me the one the kat von d bright
colors one and they're different enough
i think i could get both and feel okay
about it i might get those too yeah i
might uh we're talking about I mean
there's all kinds of cool conversations
going on and because i'm skipping and
I'm not reading the Kama private
conversations just random things just
popping up jenny t repeating Natalie's
question because i want to know mega pro
two yay or nay yes I just answered that
so yes yay on that yay on that yes
Leslie I love the Loreal voluminous
fiber lash mascara I'm a dancer in our
company performs all the time great
alternative to falsies that is good to
know the Loreal voluminous fiber lash
mascara is that the one that's got the
two tubes does it have two tubes
interesting very interesting make sure
you put gin when you respond to that
makes you put gin so that I don't miss
that response um but yeah i'll have to
check that out cool man did anyone try
the micro make a liner from boxy from
nikki's still is sitting this um did he
would try to Michael Anna from Boxxy OMG
that is hard to get off I did
trouble getting it off I do have it I
can try it um I don't know I use that
Mary Kay makeup remover and I think
maybe it's just hard cord because I
never have trouble getting things off of
that stuff then Mary Kay makeup remover
is amazing absolutely amazing so but no
I think maybe it did you know what
you're right it did take a little bit of
extra love to get that off but what I
did was I just held my makeup remover
pad on my I like just like hell it on
there for good like 30 seconds before I
even rubbed anything and that seemed to
help a lot so try that try just holding
whatever you're using for your makeup
remover just let it kind of sit on your
eye from for a little while before you
start rubbing or not really supposed to
rub you know what I'm saying before you
start trying to get it off I don't know
what you do if you don't rub what he do
you've had it off I don't know you
always get on me about rubbing my eyes
like I don't know any other way to do it
hey I'm gonna think about um let's city
everybody saying yes they had trouble
with it um Chrissy says the bosha makeup
breakup oil will take anything off so
that's good to know Thank You Chrissy
for that Rebecca does anyone else find
that lorac pro 1 and pretend to are hard
to blend I don't have the 1i have the
two you know what they do they are kind
of stiff when you put them on like you
gotta like work at blending it yes I
don't really key whatnot I do you just
gotta get us get a stiff brush you got
to make sure brush isn't too fluffy
because if it's fluffy those shadows
aren't going anywhere get a stiff one
like this is the one that I use and
people get on me wind tutorials and
think not tutorials but when i do like
getting ready with me they're like
that's not a good brush for putting
shadow when your crease like I don't
know this is the one that I use this one
is by Coastal Scents it said it's the
rcn 09 I love this brush use it all the
time but you can see kind of the density
of it you don't want to do something why
did I even have one out I like walking
some music that much like a big fluffy
ones the ones that are longer and fluffy
they won't move those lorac shadows
anywhere so just make sure you use one
that's kind of dense and it should be
alright you just gotta put a little
muscle in it you know a little not
muscle but you know I'm saying use put a
little oomph into it
all right to blue eyes I believe
everything is doable is there anything
high-end that you feel has no dupe in
the world thanks love ya okay no Duke in
films nope nope sorry if I just yelled
in your ear nope all that's terrible I
mean I was close you know I mean it's
always closed I'm like looking at myself
like you know why I could use
interchangeably a lot of things yeah
everybody's copy everybody had these
enemies cielo countless color pigments
these I have never seen anything like
these because let me show you when we
talked into it I collected these when
they were out they were home I talked
about these in my decluttering video I
collected all of these I have all of
them except for one they went on super
sale at like nordstrom rack and sell so
you could get him for like five bucks
apiece but like that's not doable you
know like you're not you can't even do
for this exact product within this line
because each one of these is poor
differently so when I go like this it
gives me like a rainbow of color like
that I mean you can't that I've never
seen anything like this anywhere else so
I found one and they don't sell these
anymore you might be able to get them on
on on how look sometimes they still have
a couple of them but these are but this
is the thing about these is a very
difficult to work with because they
don't match up you end up like getting
kind of mushy madness on one lick on
both eyes because you can't get it till
because it every three wide because you
have to um you know both our eyes you
would have to hit it in the exact same
place it's difficult to get your both
eyes to match so it ends up just
washing the colors together so do i I
don't even know if I really a hundred
percent recommend these but these are
not doing that was my answer to that
everything else probably not I mean I'm
sure there are things that formula whys
are not super duper bull if I really
thought about it like right now I'm
really digging on this color pop liquid
lipsticks I know that there are people
that hate them and there's different
variations in formula but the ones that
I've been trying I really like them a
lot especially paired with a lip balm um
I really like them and I haven't found
any other liquid lipsticks that I like
better than those and I know that's
weird because I know a lot of people
don't like them but I like them a lot
they stay on forever like if I swatch a
bunch of liquid lipsticks on my hands
the next day I still have the colour-pop
ones on my hand and I have to like scrub
them off so they last all day on my lips
and there's no other liquid lipstick
that I have tried that stays on like
that that like we're so evenly and stays
on like that so those would be my couple
of things I feel like I feel like that's
not I I haven't been able to find a
formula dupe for those just haven't and
I've heard that there's definitely ones
there's the um there's videos out there
where you can watch and see which ones
are the good ones but yeah that's what I
got to say about that I could go on and
on oh my gosh I need to shut up I can't
stop I know there's a lot of people that
have a lot of questions and I just keep
going over and it's 1058 I'm staying on
a couple extra minutes because I just
went off on a tangent oh that's what
happens when i'm sleepy writing okay
Valerie good morning to you my dear
Chelsea good morning excited about the
new Urban Decay vice for pal that's
coming up as Holly I want to put can't
wait to put my fingers in it i don't
know if i'm going to buy it but i
definitely want to put fingers in and
try it nikki says she loves the Urban
Decay ozone must be the odd man out LOL
the cargo when it's great we were
talking about lip primers I don't see
much difference but but nikki says that
they're also so maybe I should give him
another chance because I trust Nicky's
opinion Madame Bugsy hello good morning

Lanie and Leslie no Jen you're not the
only one I think they're just overpriced
lip balms we're talking about the this
was like 20 minutes ago talking about
whether lip primers were necessary or
whether they were overpriced lip balms I
feel like I just use a lip balm and it's
the same thing but I might just not have
tried I've tried the cargo one so maybe
the cargo one would blow me away

me okay it's going to skip down i think

lip primer has anyone tried it I haven't
but I would like to that's something i
should put on my wish list for next time
i go get a color pop order cool man
because i know i'm not done buying
colour-pop not done but see Sandra says
the bite lip primer is good one but it's
expensive and she agrees that a lip balm
would and then now it's going to not let

gonna stem the bottom again sorry I'm
trying ok there we go she says that the
bite lip primer is good one but it's
expensive and i agree the lipoma provide
a similar effect good to know Boston
Barbie doll sauces anyone tried the
sheer
primer from ELF I haven't tried that one
but I know that the regular one is
pretty good and then it just jumped down

promise um okay Lee says yeah no I know
I'm not where I was apologize if I
missed your question League good morning
Jen have you seen the new limited
edition Milania more I lips liquid
lipsticks some of you say they're better
than the colour-pop are you on the
lookout for them I haven't been because
I don't really have time to coach at the
drugstore and look for makeup with the
two kids in the full time job but I do I
did hear of it last week they are
available on the Milani website so I've
thought about going to the auntie
website and ordering some anybody with
opinions on the Maloney amore with the
lipsticks I would love to hear what you
guys have to say and Tabitha's trying to
help me understand with my SD card is
saying WD is western digital ok
continuum
um Julia I'm trying to get into makeup
I'm kind of a newbie though what
products you recommend for people just
starting to get into makeup ok BB it
well it depends on what your what your
skin type is like if you have a lot of
discoloration i wouldn't recommend i
would recommend kind of a start off with
this one if you have oily skin this
one's really nice the matte and poreless
if you have or normal skin if you have
dry skin there's a version of this it's
like a luminous one for dry skin so this
formula is really really good also be
rim the Rimmel powder is really really
good i think it's only like two bucks
something like that the Rimmel stay
matte is very very nice for a powder for
eyeliner definitely try a pen form of an
eyeliner not a pencil because the
pencils really are good for like
smudging out but for your top well on
your top lash line the pen is so much
easier to work with and apply in my
opinion especially for people that are
new for mascaras like I was saying
earlier my favorite mascara is the
Maybelline lash sensational for our
shadows go to the elf website get the
need it nude six bucks something like
that if you watch my contouring their
contour palette over elf is fantastic I
always feel like when you're starting
off with makeup to start with less
expensive stuff is really really good
because you don't want to invest in
something and then have trouble working
with it so get practicing with the less
expensive stuff and high quality less
expensive stuff and then work your way
up to the high end stuff if you want to
buy something that's high-end being a
new user of makeup definitely can heal
for one of the naked palettes from urban
decay those are what helped give me
confidence in using makeup they're so
easy to use so easy to use yeah those
would be definitely be my quick
recommendations because it's 1104 I'm
supposed to go on but I'm going to stay
for another five minutes or so six
minutes and then i gotta go play with my
kids um let's see ok and then gnarling
full who is tabitha she says if you have
any tech questions ask her she's really
good at that stuff Valerie so I have to
go on to know by four year cuz I'm
sitting on my first apartment trying to
move out by the end of 2016 sending good
vibes guys goodbye

really really hope that that works out
well for you ok and then Shannon ok

the tartlet Howlett Thank You Veronica I
love you thank you you are the best
Boston Barbie doll I think you're
talking about tech stuff Nicole hi
Nicole if you're just starting out I was
just given advice for just starting out
she says you don't want to spend way too
much money to figure out what you like
exactly girlfriend the one thing is used
foundation or tinted moisturizer yes I
agree angry if you like you um if you
don't have skin problems I didn't say
this and you don't have like I don't
have a whole lot of
discolorations things start after the BB
cream or CC cream especially going to
create this woman just fabulous the
cornea BB cream is amazing I've never
had one person say a bad thing about
this it is amazing so that would be my
recommendation for something that
doesn't have a lot of skin discoloration
okay Leslie anyone have a suggestion for
eye makeup remover I've been using the
Mary Kay one but I feel I have to scrub
now them you think I've ever lash
mascara oh I love my Mary Kay one um
yeah definitely help her out with that
because i love my mary kay one that's
the one that I use ok coconut oil
everybody's saying coconut oil good to
know ok Chris 200 mg is Jen was
answering my youtube question everything
froze i'm not getting the comments
anymore either know Oh Kristen I
remember what the question was but it's
reported so you can just go back and
fast forward you just kind of scan
around for it I'm sorry Krista mm-hmm
OBO show everybody sing the bozhe one
for the cleansing oil ok ray says hey
Jed good morning finally able to oh I
already got that I'm gonna tear to talk
about that cooking on too heavy for me
oh the makeup eraser from Valerie is a
pic of a race or two I really love it
but I've heard you can just get a
microfiber towel like that people use
for cars that you can use that as makeup
as a makeup remover you just put hot
water on it and as hot as you can stand
for your face and you don't wanna burn
yourself but and you know something
that's you know pretty pretty warm and
then just gently rub your eyes with a
microfiber towel I love that too but it
gets dirty and then I hand up like not
forgetting to wash it and then I just
end up using my Mary Kay and then
nerdling full um she says there's a
great discussion topics for the forum go
up and go sign up and discuss their now
we have a forum for the what's of the
makeup website so if you haven't gone
over there yet like i have one over
there yet because it's brand-new today
go over the form and discuss lots of
these topics like I make remover and
things like that Leslie says trying
she's going to try the coconut way on a
mat of bugs me I can't get the app to
work on my laptop or iPads etc well
wouldn't work on your laptop it should
work on your iPad there is a way I think
that it works best on phones but there
is a way to do it and maybe we can put
on Tabatha's maybe we can put figure out
how to get the app on an iPad and then
put it on the website or put it on the
forum somehow for how to how to do that
because somebody figured out how to get
it on ipad and i forget what the process
was she mean we can figure that out and
post that over there okay I would really
appreciate it thank you tab if you can
figure it out i'm sure you can because
you're awesome okay it's 1110 if there's
86 people here which is quite a quite a
bit for what my um what my number is I'm
going to see on five more minutes I'm
going to push it five more minutes so
now there's a lot of great comments down
here and I hate to go I hate believe you
know I'm not going to leave yet I'm not
going to do it all right Julia I'm
trying to find an eye shut up how if it
has a lot of easy blendable colors
definitely if I had to recommend
anything to Naked palette urban decay
naked palettes especially the one in the
2 i've heard great things p some people
love three some people love the smoky
but i love the two that's the one that I
use I don't own any of the other ones
Terry hey there from Kansas first have
commented with your current favorite
drugstore mascara I said it a few times
but I'll say it again the Maybelline
lash sensational is my holy grail of all
mascaras high-end drug store this one
Maybelline lash sensational yes amen all
right Lisa Jen are you and John going to
do a smack down again we're supposed to
film one today cross your fingers that
it actually happens we have a set bird
video we have to film together because
set bird sent him a separate man
subscription was just one month so we
have to film that so cross your fingers
for a Smackdown being film today which
would mean that it would not come out
this week but it will come out the
following week I watched a snack down
the other day that I haven't watched a
Smackdown a long time one of the old
ones man they are they really are funny
he's just never home anymore because
he's been so busy with work so he's just
he's never home there's a lot of going
on with his business but I don't waste
time talking about it but he's just not
he's on home a lot so but yes Lisa
hopefully one is being filmed today
cross your fingers Shannon okay anyone
who yells a gin for not putting up more
videos
zip it thank you i do want to just
always know if I don't put up videos
it's not that I don't want to it's not
them slacking it's not that I'm not
trying it's just because work to
precedents that week for one reason or
another and a lot of that's confidential
like I can't talk to you about you know
personal issues with my students and
things like that so um you know
sometimes I may not be able to put it up
as many videos just know it's not
because I'm slacking it's not because I
don't care and it's not because I don't
want to do YouTube anymore promise leann
that's why I don't do YouTube when you
work full-time 70s we can go to spend
time with your children you can make
video content for every day I'll be
lucky if I do 11 once a week people
expect a lot that's true i mean you look
at someone like kathleenlights who puts
up so many video she was up so much
concept but she has no children she has
no husband and you know she can do that
and I think that's awesome that she can
but I can't in my real person life I had
a production crew maybe but I don't it's
just me um KJ says teaching is one of
the most important jobs I think so too I
do and I feel like you know I don't know
people think that teaching is easy just
because you know well it's one plus one
equals two have heart that can that be
it's it's really hard it's actually
really hard there's a lot so much more
behind the scenes that people don't
realize it's really not an easy job at
all so just so you know it's definitely
harder than YouTube I'll tell you that
by for Chrissy says use coconut oil on
her eyes it gets her eyes too heavy but
then found the bush and fell in love
Nikki maybe schedule like a post on what
every day if you do extra videos great
if not the people can't complain so the
problem is with scheduling a specific
day is that what if I can't get the
video up by that day you know so I just
try to leave it open for the week
because I don't like to commit to
specific day keeping up with what's a
good makeup and specifically putting up
on Sundays it's hard enough for me so
having two videos that are scheduled is
really hard I'd rather sleeve it open
for the week even if it comes out on
Friday you know so but thank you for the
suggestion I do appreciate it um Thank
You Sammy for your comment I can't read
it because it has a bad word in it but
thank you very much let's see okay it's
11 13 I've gotta just you a couple more
and then I've got to go unfortunately so
if you're just coming in i'm so sorry if
I didn't get a chance to answer your
question i'm definitely come back next
week it should be 10 a.m. again next
week for easter time i'm just talking
about working full time and things like
that i'm going to look for a question
real quick i'll go back and read these
after chats uber okay Julie is talking
about she has the first naked palette
but she wishes there were more Purple's
blues etc try out what about the lorac
pro 2 have you looked at that that's a
really nice palette very easy to use
Lily says own uploading a version of the

show you guys how awesome the app is we
