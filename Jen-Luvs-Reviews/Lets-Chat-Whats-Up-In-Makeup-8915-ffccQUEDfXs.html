chat to see if there are people here
because I haven't even had a chance to
do that yet I slept in to the very last
possible minute Sunita I didn't I didn't
do all the prep that I know I want you
to get ready for this I didn't see other
people here yeah there's people here
that's cool oh my goodness yeah because
you guys know I stay up way too late
getting this stuff ready so yes I slept
in a little bit way little bit too much
so let's go ahead and get into the
conversation Oh Sandra's actually here
Sandra says good morning I'm here early
say hello will be away from my desk
prolly most of the chat that's my mother
to stand in for me say hi Joanne I do an
Sandra and I are actually one of them
all after this we all just left you far
from me so we're gonna go mall some
really excited about that I've never met
Sandra was supposed to go to the vib
rouge event with her we're still on
vacation so that he could do that so now
I gets good mom with Sandra oh and I'm
so excited um Lee Anne good morning to
you I've got a fresh cup of coffee ready
for this Jack me too good morning just a
good morning Nicki good morning steph
good morning Jenna uh um good morning
Jenna and everyone hope you were having
a fabulous weekend thank you i hope your
having to feel that this weekend to my
dear liz good morning to you is yes i'm
doing better yeah as you may know i have
i'm having issues with my eyes it's a
contact lens related issue so I'm not
allowed to wear my contact lenses which
kind of stinks I have very dry corneas
so um it's a little bit of damage to my
corneas from my contact lenses from
different stupid things that I've done
like wearing them to the beach in them
one night accidentally slept in my
contact lenses look a couple of weeks
ago and then I took them out at the end
of the nut well at the end of the next
night so my eyes were super dry the next
day so I've just been not been very nice
to nice oh I've got eyedrops and
everything hopefully I'm on the mend I
don't really see much difference as of
now but we'll see what
what happens um but yeah I am I I don't
know if I'm doing better I'm doing okay
I'm fine where my contact lenses I'm
here I've all still work so we're good
Shannon says good morning good morning
to Shannon good morning to Krista Jen
have everything up I'm feeling much
better i'm working on it man one day at
a time they're not too bad it's just
more annoying than anything hi Christy
in Northern Ireland says firstly I want
to say that you the cluttering series
has been my favorite things you've done
all thank you do it for a liquid
lipsticks and if so do you have any
favorites no I don't furlan lipsticks
that's one thing that I am learning
liquid lipsticks are messy girlfriend
and I get tired of being messy like I I
just want to put on the lipstick I don't
have to worry about it you know saying
um so far I seen I don't know I think
maybe the steal the formula is my
favorite right now I'm not really sure I
just got these new Nick's ones I got a
few of these the liquid suede and that
made me realize that I actually don't
really like the next soft matte lip
creams I thought I like them but I don't
think I do they kind of stick to my dry
patches I really thought I'd like that
maybe it's just this one that I tried
yesterday and I was like oh um but yeah
these I just got it yesterday I truck
I'd one real quick but I don't I haven't
worn all day so I can't let speak to the
next one's probably the scalar ones are
my favorite I don't mind the colour-pop
ones when people are saying they're
really drying but i think i just got
ones that have really good formulas
compared to some of the other ones i
just ordered more though from the new
collection that new pink one that just
came out i just ordered that one and
then a couple more so we'll see how the
formulas are on those but um but I love
my bumble man boggles my heart i love
that thing this one no yep this one oh
my gosh i love this one this one's so
pretty that one's gonna be really nice
in the fall too i love that one and then
the other one this one
and I say saulo it might be solo this
one's really nice too they are kind of a
wet formula and but they dry they dry
completely like with these the next
month he's never dry like ever they're
sticky forever this one is going before
a swatch of this one is in where are you
soft-spoken so we'll let those dry for a
second and I'll show you what they do
the difference so we'll come back to
those in a second after they dry and
I'll give you some more details but I
honestly like regular lipstick way
better than liquid lipsticks i think i'm
waiting for the trend to to fade a bit
not the biggest fan i mean they're fine
I like that they last a really long time
but you're messy to apply all right here
we go maybe I'll like it better once i'm
back to work maybe i'll fall more in
love with the good lipsticks because i
wanted to reapply my lipstick as much
Krista Jen what I shadow were you
wearing the color pop video I got to get
my hands on it oh I got for you
girlfriend oh my gosh I am I just did an
exclusive video on the one week without
showing this these pallets where are
they just because I you know not because
of any other reason other than I can't
do a full video on them because I just
can't fit it in the schedule but oh what
did I do with it oh you know what it's
probably in this drawer I just throw a
bunch of stuff in the store is it here
it's a box of shadow yes it's right here
good it's the box and customizable power
here I got these with MC points oh my
gosh was so exciting at these with ypsi
points like I still can't believe it
it's this one here I believe it's called
a lot along lavish and it is so sick of
orders oh my gosh store dress it's like
an iridescent pinky purple so awesome
okay so back to the liquid lipsticks
real quick so these well I don't know I
guess I can't really tell there's these
really aren't dry but these feel like
smooth the next one feels like oily and
then eventually it feels sticky I don't
like your tissue but these
try this one will not dry maybe we'll
wait wait a little longer and see if I
can get it to do it because yesterday I
was watching the next ones and it's like
every time I turned around I was like
touching my hand and I was like it looks
still yucky but I don't remember what
that happening with the colour-pop ones
but anyway moving on yes I love this and
it's it is if they are 12 books a shadow
man but if you're going to get any of
them I would definitely recommend low
I'll lavish this one's actually really
nice too this one is in a satin
seduction and that's just a met is it
meant it's got a tiny bit of a set into
it tiny bit of a satin to it but that
one's really really nice oh and this one
here this one's gold something old
something cool I bet look look I can't
not look this one's really nice too this
one is in gold status I'll swatch these
on my hand too so there's the cream one
you see how big that is and a lot of
cream colors are not opaque like that
and there's the gold status oh my gosh
oh my gosh oh my gosh I love in love
with these they're such high quality
sucked my quality all right we're much I
should go there it is okay let's move on
from there let's see a net is here yay
hi Annette Kay Wow never been here at
the start before glad you have your UK
yay alright let's see and that's she's
always missing the start to Nikki good
morning to you my dear so glad you got
some drops for your on yes thank you i
have had cornea a break just before and
they're no joke i know it girlfriend
Nikki anyone do any damage was before
this week I did um I I'm going shopping
with Sandra today so probably more
damage I got the kat von d chrysalis
palette for 33 bucks because I could not
resist because I've always wanted that
talent it was on sale and John said we
have a couple extra dollars in the bank
the small cells like I'm spinning it on
me look like I need it I just
decluttered a bunch but
it's nice to have comparisons of things
for videos and all it's nice to try
different things and if things don't
work the great thing about so far is so
easy to return stuff for me because it's
like super close to my house um I got
that and then what else did I get oh I
got to give me some lip kit the new one
the $25 one so excited to get that and
then some little sampling guys it was a
vib rouge like perk or whatever where it
was a really nice sample bag of
different samples yeah you get like
add-ons or whatever from Sephora it has
a tattoo liner in trooper like a little
mini one mind dying so I'm really
excited to throw that one away and get a
new one a couple other things I'm really
excited to get so this issue things I
got and we'll see what kind of damage
Sandra and I do good at the mall let's
see did anybody else do any damage it's
before this week I think I would love to
know what she bought okay so she didn't
even watch what to make up yeah well
it's a long one this week because it's
like a double dose because we didn't do
it last week steph says oh that's right
i hope everyone is feeling better that
was a scary two weeks it was i don't
know if you guys saw i only posted i
think on my Twitter that Lila actually
got hurt and I had to take her to the ER
a couple of days ago she was riding on
her bike and her bike is she just got a
new one she's got 20 inch and she can
ride it man she rode she wrote a lot at
the beach and had no problems um but she
was get trying to get off of the bike
and I guess it's just a little too
client she's kind of on our tiptoes and
the bike kind of tipped over and she
lost her balance and she hit her neck on
handlebars and it basically like ripped
her neck open so she came in she's like
mommy I hurt myself in my bike and I
came running in or whatever I was like
we're here Eddie she's like my neck and
she hope it up she's got this big gash
in her neck like this big I was like ooh
was it for take me to the hospital like
it I you know got around the house was
possible she's got five stitches in her
neck first time we've ever been to the
yard with the kids zoom in at seven
years so she's doing much much better it
was a rough couple of first couple of
days the you know irrigation was
horrible and it was a rough first couple
days but she's doing much better now
much better now all right enough about
me let's talk about some make up a net
so good to see you too
law missed last week yeah I miss last
week to I'm only sad i was out loud did
you see the la la lavish i shatter like
it's launched not once for you it's
amazing uh let's see what's going on
okay jessica is talking to Nikki did is
everybody's talking to nikki about what
they got oh let's see lots of good stuff
uh hi kay Florrie good morning to you
Jenna she said I already had half of the
give me lip set so I pass but if I
didn't know what a grab did ya good
morning to Jackie k says who new house I
see some u-haul boxes yeah I've got the
one back there I haven't spent a lot of
time in here I've been mostly focusing
on like the kids rooms in my bedroom and
we unpacked the kitchen completely so I
haven't really put away I mean I put
away a couple of boxes like a lot of
stuff ago see this room otherwise I'm
going to stuff my head and I wanted to
organize I didn't want to just throw it
out I wanted to organize it so it's
taking me a little while to go through
everything this whole floor over here is
like covered in gunk of stuff and I've
got stuff in the closet over there mMmmm
yeah I got a lot of stuff like that one
I'll even know what's in that one oh
that's my nail polish racks I got to get
my nail polish up I really want to john
hasn't been how much to help me hang
them i don't want to put anything in
these walls without him watching me
making sure i'm not doing some stupid
Marlene and good morning to you a good
to hear your eyes are better house
Lila's neck aren't kids so fun I know
right girlfriend yeah eyes are doing ok
well I was next to him great success so
it's gonna be crazy trying to get those
rewards I think everyone has thousands
of points just sitting in their accounts
I don't know um I you know when I go to
the vib rouge events I'm always amazed
at how many people have vib rouge status
onlys an absolutely amazing things like
this many people got this much money to
spend on to make them holy moly there's
kids starving in China Africa or
whatever you know whatever they say
these days I know it's what my mom used
to say when I was a kid I don't know
what they say now but but yeah I mean
I've never ever talked
cuz I was there too but you know but
still i have about a thousand points a
little over a thousand points so i'm
definitely going to try to get one that
I what was the one that I really wanted
I can't remember what it was I got to
look for it now saved for ah see now I
gotta look Sephora what do they called
epic rewards images i love google man
okay so oh the Bekaa i wanted to get the
back of the Jacqueline hell luminizing
collection because I'm not buying the
jaclyn hill highlighter for $39 whatever
but it would be really nice to have it
for my collection so i will probably um
go for that one but see then there's
like there's there's I'm seeing now they
have a G vashi best of la rouge lipstick
collection that would be really nice to
get and then they have the shape matters
Smashbox contour kit for a thousand
points and then add your catwalk eyes
said I probably won't get that um I've
had good luck with your eye shadows so
that one doesn't excite me and then I've
heard weird things about the Smashbox
shape matters contour I can't have heard
like mix things I know my friend Susan w
did a review of it i just saw that last
night but i didn't watch the video yet
so i'll have to watch that see what
Susan says and then if Susan didn't like
it and I'm definitely not getting it but
it'll be between the Bekaa unless you've
won she won because I don't think they
have a 2000 reward if they had a 2000
reward I might be up for oh they do of
course they do all right they had oh my
goodness they had the YSL couture I book
nars blush Authority palette they have
the Sephora collection best sellers kit
and the kat von d liner vault what's
what oh my gosh i just found these Oh
see now I might have to like rock out
with the with Sandra today and spend
some money I don't know we'll see no no
I have my eye on that Jaclyn hill one
known maybe i'll get the Jacqueline home
on and the geelong she 10 know me it's
so bad it's so bad and the reason why I
have so many 24 points is because I
don't I don't shop at all to that much
and also super close to me so now I'm
probably going to also more but I
haven't bought that much it on at
sephora this year compared to what I've
been spending it support in previous
years usually on vib rouge by now for
the next year but I'm not think I'm
going like I don't know four hundred
dollars in or something I know that
sounds like a lot of money I sound like
such an eight almost word i almost said
that I shouldn't say I sound like such a
jerk um but it's because of the makeup
channel and I take the money that I earn
from youtube and then I recycle it into
sephora so it's not like I'm pulling for
my teacher money for this this is like
YouTube money feeding back into the
channel so you know people that watch my
videos are benefiting from my purchases
you know what I'm saying like so it's
not just like I don't know I just sound
like kind of a jerk a minute ago so I
felt the need to explain myself a bit um
but anyway so I will see what happens
with Sandra today I don't know I don't
know what I'm gonna do um wanting to do
oh I don't know okay anyway moving on
all right steph says cuz the rewards
have stuck for a while they haven't been
very good lately at all at all um I feel
now i'm like i'd spend like a 500-point
on you know different things or whatever
that was uh no I don't know but anyway
I've spent like 500 points on a couple
of things before and it's like why did I
spend my 500 boys i can add 500 more
points um let's see kay says she's not
gonna fight either i guess it's gonna be
depend on whether things are available
whether people scoop it up or not well
sing um nikki says she's still gonna
hoard her points for now uh hi a lot of
good to see you a lot of high I just saw
you followed me on Twitter I just
followed you back cases i hate liquid
lipsticks dry lips city I mean I guess
my lips are always dry off the time I'm
constantly putting lip balm on so like
when something dries out my lips I just
put a lip balm on and then I'm fine like
no I can't be good morning to you candy
good morning to you my dear tabatha so
good to see you Jessica yeah I'm
hoarding and I know
and I know what I want but I don't but I
won't get my hopes up you know yeah
exactly that's a good idea that's what
i'm going to do too i'm gonna take your
advice Jessica fizzy pop good morning to
you uh oh Alana says i love the elmo mug
i got this at Sesame Street land or
something like that I couldn't resist I
used to be huge elbow fan like yeah you
go through phases like I went to a
tweety bird phase and I went through an
Elmo phase like as like an older person
like not older but like a late teens
early 20s and go through phases of
things I'm glad I never got tattoos
though I really wanted a tweety bird
tattoo at one point i'm so glad i didn't
do that candy i'm excited for the
sephora sub box me too i live in dayton
but my mom is in since nice i hope when
you get them there oh I hope you get it
Oh candy I hope you get it you've got to
let me know about it you get you gotta
let me know um feel like a.j yeah you
made it KJ I'm so glad that you're here
thank you for reminding me with the
parentheses of your name because I like
to get people's names right and if I see
them enough I remember them like make up
new by knows Jenna you know like I you
know makeup girl rocks i know is Alana
like it just takes me a minute to get it
but you're kjs at the end of your feline
so that should be pretty easy ah de
Canio good morning thank you for your
contributions to squeak my dear I really
appreciate it he'll be in Spencer good
morning thank you so much for walking me
back love what's up in makeup oh I'm so
glad your joy curious question do you
have any out their Halloween lip colors
like blues greens yellows no I've never
bought any of those I've never like
really dressed up as a me for helping
where I would need a weird lip color
except for maybe black um but now I
don't have any I don't have any uh nikki
says she can't wait for the sub bucks to
step interested in the Sephora
subscription box but I hope it's not the
same kind of samples we get in stores if
I get more one more Elizabeth and James
wonderful have a lot to offer to me yeah
i'm with you i think i have i have the
little 100-point ones of both of those 2
i'm with you i have a feeling it's going
to be a lot of those 100-point perks
I'll box and it's not going to look as
awesome when you go in you're not going
to spend your hundred points on a little
you know thing if you're getting in the
subscription box but that's not
everybody's going to have the
subscription I don't know but I would
imagine it's going to be like the foil
packs in 100-point perks and then maybe
sometimes with the 250s like a little
haha the buzz in 50 ohms are usually 250
but we'll see what happens but i think
that smart of sephora CR is the Ipsy and
boxy charm mbaka journal box shows
they're in a different price range but
if C and Birchbox how that's going to
affect them I am huge like loyal
Birchbox FC person like especially
Birchbox because I've actually talked to
people at that company the woman it
makes all the videos like she's like my
contact person with a woman with the
dark hair she's a contact person over
there so like I'm like really like I
don't know when I feel like I have a
personal connection with a company like
I get really really loyal so like I'm a
huge Birchbox person and like I'm a huge
box e-tron person because that I've
never connected leave a tipsy but I
don't know I'm just I don't think it's
going to affect them to the point where
they're gonna have trouble but I think
people are going to some people are
gonna have to choose so we'll see we'll
see what happens let's see Kate Caitlyn
Caitlyn Caitlyn when we make sure you
get your tea in there Caitlyn Jen I'm a
teacher too and just went back hope
you're enjoying your summer you deserve
a thank you you deserved your summer too
I want to ask you ever tried any lush
products if so what products do you love
my husband used to have someone working
at the shop that worked at lush as her
full-time job she looked the shop part
time as our counter person and she used
to bring our samples of different things
and honestly like when she worked there
I never liked I never appreciated her
like she brought all this stuff from
watchlist she'll bring like bags of
stuff like and it was like ah this is
cool you know and I just didn't know any
better than to like realize what I was
getting for free um so I honestly I
don't have any favorites um you know I'm
not really a bath person like I don't
take baths
I do have some bath products I need to
try out the Gemma sent me I their bath
bath salts light from Jenna and then I
have some bath salts from using box that
I need to try out but but I'm not really
a big back person so like a lot of stuff
at lush I don't like I don't gravitate
toward but I know they have a lot of
other things you know the lotions and
the scrubs and all that stuff but I
haven't really gone into lush land I
just did the what's up makeup swap
through the facebook group and I got a
couple lush products for my swap partner
so I am anxious to try those um you have
tried the lush lip scrub once and I
really really like that if I had to say
anything from my limited remembering of
what I've tried it wash that stands out
to being amazing there were other things
I just can't remember it's been a long
time hmm but um but over I've heard
great things about lush products just I
don't have a good memory for what I
tried back thanks it was years ago I was
like two or three years ago alright but
anyway thank you for that question
though I need to get more into lush
stuff you have any recommendations if
you do then i will put them into my
phone so that i remember when i go to
lush to try some things Sammy good
morning I've been stalking for months on
my iPad finally on my old laptop a good
comment yeah yeah I'm so glad you're
here Sammy Amanda good morning I need
some coffee get some coffee girlfriend
and come back I guess any I love Elmo
good morning good morning is sanjay
singh is our drug store reporter yesenia
and I have a date we are going to the
bite beauty store in October to go to
the bite Beauty labs get lipsticks me
for us so we have a date in October to
go do that together John of course is
going to be there with me we're going
I'm going to the generation beauty event
in October in New York City so John

sure John will be there with us but um
but yeah I don't know if he's going to
get a lipstick made I would imagine not
but but you Sonny and I are gonna get
lipsticks made I'm so excited about that
a flurry quick question ulta or sephora
I'm a staff or a girl because I like I
don't know it's something about the
return policy like I know ulta prolly
has the same return policy and the
points I don't know there's something
about also that calls to me it's like
Target or Walmart you know like well
everybody likes one or the other
no and I don't know why support calls to
me I guess also because I like the
people at my local support better than
the people at my local ulta like not
that they're bad people and me could
wherever they just aren't as like into
their jobs i don't think as a four-piece
where people seem like they're really
into it they know what's going on they
know where all the new makeup is when i
go into otha they're all kind of like I
gotta say okay well what did you get you
know recently that's new and they're
just kind of like well I don't really
know I'm Betty buddy do you know we got
this new let me get my manager for you
you know it's like when I go on to
support I can walk up to anybody and be
like all right what you got what's new
and won't be like all right we got this
we got this we got this we got this like
I just feel like they're more into their
jobs I'm not it makes me want to visit
there because i feel like i can have
makeup chat with people you know I'm San
oh jon is making the smoothie i don't
know if you guys can hear that it's kind
of loud for me but but anyway yeah
sephora i'm a sephora fan staff that's
the problem if i'm buying a box for 10
bucks a month I don't want to see the
same they have the same stuff I have I
know it's the same thing I completely
agree with you did anyone get the
Smashbox on the rock spot last year
found it at nordstrom should I get it I
saw it nordstrom too I looked at reviews
for that and he did not look very good
so I did not get it I thought about

ladies ya then I've heard negative
things about that pal which makes me sad
favor Fenwick good morning sorry about
your little ones accident thank you i'm
here for a few i have to have to unpack
house yeah you gradually spun move I'm
glad to see you two this morning hi Amy
so good to see you my dear crystal a
curious question you mentioned that John
had some foundations when you did a
clutter what kind of makeup does he wear
he does how how did he as a male feel
comfortable and wearing makeup okay so
John when john goes through phases he's
always been that kind of person where he
gets really into something and then he
stopped doing it so he was doing the
youtube channel where it's like a like a
beauty guru imperative channel it's
called fun time with John it's
adults-only it's so inappropriate for
anyone under 18 it's inappropriate for
anybody to be food odds it's it's
hilarious and awesome but you have to
have that disgusting sense of humor in
order to get it um it's really pretty I
mean it's on that edge you know what I'm
saying like it's it's inappropriate so
it's anyway so he bought a bunch of make
up for that whenever we go to beauty
events and things he always wears some
makeup and then also when we film he
wears makeup but other than that he
doesn't wear makeup in daily life he did
for a little while when he was buying
all the makeup for the for the youtube
channel he was wearing to make up to
work in different things some
foundations and concealer things like
that but um you know I'm a little bit of
eyeliner stuff like that but I mean John
has never been somebody that cares what
other people think uh he's just he
marches to his own beat he does his own
thing so he doesn't really care like
what anyway thinks he does what he wants
to do and that's one thing that's always
attracted me to him and one thing I've
always loved about him is that he's
unafraid of other people's opinions of
him he's like you're gonna judge me
whatever I care like he's he's amazing
like that so um he just does what he
wants to do and he hasn't been wearing
makeup lately uh we're actually playing
on filming together i'm really hoping
semper actually offered to send him a
one month of set for men so he agreed to
do that video with me i told him all
that we've gone start to amass down
again so you'll be seeing John wearing
to make up some time soon I'm sure
because he always puts on makeup on my
phone but uh but yeah he's just I mean
he's eat he doesn't have a problem feel
comfortable doing anything that man
knows what he wants to do and I love him
for it
good morning to shell Miller good
morning to you Amy's ask me how my eye
is it's a little bit better it's pretty
much the same it's a little bit better

me but she's amazing she built it for me
she's awesome and it just kind of um you

want to start all right in campaign we
need to ask becca to make a collection
for christmas deluxe samples of all the

in October but that would be really
smart though I will buy and kind I $150
so but if they they came out with a
little ones or like a pallet mmm yeah be

for fair to light skin you're never
going to go wrong with the naked
palettes girlfriend the original and the
2 the 3 I don't know i've heard mixed
things about the three especially for
fair to light it would depend on what
your undertones are um those are good i
don't know if they still sell me these
these are this one's nice this is the
steel eyes are the window palette and
window to the spirit palette i love that
but that's got a lot of deep shades in
there but it's also got a really nice
selection of ones you probably use as
lid color that's a good one what else do
I have that you would like
let's check out lorac Pro nods to be
dark that's lorac Pro to think and our
sellers kind of dark too yeah that one's
super dark you're not gonna want that

too dark that's why don't ever use that
one did you see the new naturally pretty
romantic I palette that and that's with
mesh look pretty pretty natural oh it's
a thing it cosmetics yeah naturally
pretty this is the original one but the
one that's that they just came out with
that one's really light it looks like
there's lots of light shades in there um
so that one might be white 11 you want
to check out the brand new it's only on
QVC I think Susan w has a review of it I
linked it under what's the makeup under
the video see there's anything else in

that smoky once I want to look at it I
don't know look at the shades of the
smoke you want on the elf website um but
yeah check out the cosmetics one is that
one looks amazing new one the romantic
one Ashley what would you recommend for
a full coverage foundation I have
horrible rosacea have you tried this
this stuff is amazing um this isn't a
foundation this is a concealer but this
is the booboo cover up concealer ah this
stuff is phenomenal oh my gosh it's
amazing let me cover up a freckle oh my
gosh tiny little bit see if I can this
is not the
skin to him right now for me a BAM it's
like gone man like this is amazing for
concealer I don't have redness those I
don't know like if I'm speaking
ignorantly because the redness also the
it cosmetics bye bye under eye is really
good so if you put that down as kind of
a base also the erase paste by benefit
of really good things about that that my
I had a friend that had really bad acne
scarring and she swore by the benefits
erase paste um and then putting on the
foundation over tom now the one I always
recommend even though I don't have this
problem and I'm not a makeup artist but
I've heard good things about people
using where are you here it is the estee
lauder double wear this stuff is fab if
you go to emilynoel83 channel there was
a period of time where she had what was
that called she had like a thing while
she was pregnant where she had this
horrible like a dark on her cheeks and
she used a lot of foundations during
that time and she gave a lot of
recommendations and her skin looked law
less flawless and when she took her
makeup off she had all of his darkness
on her cheeks but I'd pretty sure she
use a lot of estee lauder double wear
during that time and is a fab foundation
absolutely fab so highly recommending
that what if anyone has any
recommendations for Ashley her name is
Ashley Maroney ma ro n ey just at Ashley
Maroney and and let her know some full
coverage foundations for rosacea come
and see all right Katrina thank you
ladies they need to go see swatches i'm
just lazy to today she's ever oh every
one's talking about um about the
eyeshadow palettes for lighter skin
tones Nikki I like blush but they're
still expensive for what you get i'm
starting to make my own bath bombs I've
heard that it's not very difficult and I
saw that elko um Ellie she's if you
haven't seen el coche channel Ellie's
channel it's she does pinterest tests I
actually did a couple of Pinterest s and
then I stopped doing it and now I'm
kicking myself his Ellie's channel she
got almost 200,000
drivers now because that's what she does
she does pinterest us but she did want
making a bath bomb she's amazing like
she really does a great job of
explaining things showing very closely
how she makes the stuff and then she
decides whether it's a fail or a holy
grail fantastic channel I did a
collaboration with her a few months ago
and she had I had the most subscribed as
it was me and her and jen chapman and we
I had I had the most subscribers by like
three thousand subscribers in like that
like I don't know I even more than that
like I way more subscribers in the one
and now Elly's got like almost 200,000
subscribers that girl's channel blew up
but for a reason because it's a
fantastic channel like yeah if you're
interested in making your own bath bomb
she's got a really good video on making
bath bombs yeah and it's a lot cheaper
than buying them at lush April good

age 16 hi Jenna finally watch on my
laptop so glad you're here my phone
never lets me comment i know i love
these chats i'm so glad to have you here
she says i have you tried to steal a
liquid lipsticks is it any good yes I do
really like them I've tried to I got a
sample in an Ipsy bag and then I bought
a full size one and I do like them so
she needs to find her friend a birthday
present the seal liquid lipsticks are my
only the only mid price brand liquid
lipsticks here in the UK yeah definitely
I would say go for it from my to liquid
lipstick experience I would say go for
it but definitely check some other
reviews of people that you trust just to
make sure because I've only tried to
formula to UM two different ones and
what I'm learning through my color pop
video is it formulas can be extremely
inconsistent for um for liquid lipsticks
so I just happen in color pop to get
some really awesome formulas as far as
the shades that I got so I don't know as
far as the Stila whether they vary in
Formula throughout the line
but i definitely recommend checking out
on some videos before you buy them but
from my limited experience with the two
shades i would say yes they're great
let's see fbh 16 I don't want to pay pay
customs for the Anastasia Beverly homers
and so the cat funny ones don't get the
planet Anastasi ones the ones that I
thought were horrible absolutely
horrible especially for 20 ology piece I
got two three of them I forget but
Buddhist mm-hmm don't get those the kat
von d ones i've heard great things but i
don't blame him um for not wanting to
spend the twenty dollars on a liquid
lipstick Nikki I think the owner of Lucy
says she gives samples for bloggers they
don't own any Mac I'm stubborn and I
think they were rated to Lucy's bum Luke
sees bombshell is supposed to be the
champagne pop that's good to know off
the check it out i'm kind of backed up
with videos right now like I've got too
many that I've committed to so I can't
really do another one right now but once
I get these knocked out I've got a when
I started to film it's called see my
fabric box it's like a craft month at I
have to film um and then I've got uh
Jenna sent me a bunch of stuff from it
always slips me every time every time
from I have some stuff here perfectly
posh perfectly posh that I'm working on
trying some things for and then Adam
glam I'm trying things for so I don't
want to get any more stuff from
companies right now I just want to focus
on the ones that I have so but one thing
that's good is it's like a craft and
then skincare and bath stuff and then
make up so I can try them separately and
really get good reviews on them well
yeah I don't have to look at that for in
like a month or two once I get these
ones that committed to done KJ says who
he does he like the Sanford man i was
think about doing that for my hubby John
wears cologne but he has so many samples
from like Birchbox and stuff that he
doesn't really buy full-size colognes
because he just uses the samples he gets
in your sample every month so it's like
you know he doesn't really need of
cologne subscription but maybe he'll get
addicts to it I don't know their boxes
they haven't sent it to him yet so we'll
see what happens I haven't heard back
from as far as like a set at a scent
that they want him to
or whatever I just responded them and
said yeah what was it yesterday so
they're probably not at work till Monday
so we'll see what happens Nicki Jen and
nirvana is the mac Dube oh ok there are

hundred bucks i don't know if i need to
wonder where the makeup though so we'll
see we'll see what happens I don't know
I don't know I don't know what's gonna
happen but John said I've got extra
money we've got a little bit extra money

I could I could spend a little bit money
if I wanted to so we'll see we'll see
what happens but ok so now i want to
show you out the liquid lipstick so down
here are the colour-pop ones look at
this see how they're not moving and then
this one is the knicks suede and it's
still smeary see the difference like

say I'm gonna have tol tol I haven't
worn as much because comes dark I'm
leaving for winter time to wear tall you
say hold on I didn't swatch tow for you
here's toll sorry that was well move
here's a toll I made a mess of my hand
let's see how dark toll is tall is gonna
have to wait for one more time but yeah
like them but I think I just hit on some
of the really good ones by accident
because there's Stephanie some
inconsistencies in their formula
according to a lot of people it's crazy
that color pop video was the most
inconsistent I've ever seen my comments
section like ever something like yeah I
love color province on you were like ha
drop is so overhyped I can't believe
that you like this product of that
product some people are like yeah I get
so much fallout with the eyeshadows and
some people like I've never had that
problem like i never seen comments so
inconsistent as far as opinions usually
everybody's pretty much on the same
train you know we're all kind of on the
same page the colour-pop one everybody
is all over the place I don't get it
it's so weird it's weird that everybody
has such different experiences I don't
know I've never seen it that very so I
don't know I like the color pop ones but
like I said go to twiddle makeup junkie
one-on-ones video before you buy any of
those at the Anastasia Beverly Hill ones
I don't like the ones that I got I don't
like and I don't even know what I did
with that you're like missing you know
another good brand is Oh wah Oh for a
good brand for liquid lipsticks they've
been out for a while next liquid suede I
don't have it's like come on man and so
let's close this is like my try a drawer
and I just started these are the other
two liquids weights that I got this one
is in tea and cookies and then this one
is in life's a beach swatch these oh my
goodness 1058 I better hurry up okay I
Cassandra and I got stuff to do alright
so there is that one this one is called
what did I say tea and cookies and this
one is ice watch this one yet this one
is life's a beach i'm curious what that
would look like next to weegy you put
that next to color cops VG
no yeah we jeez a little bit darker a
little more red where life's a beach is
a little paint here but they're in the
same kind of family though and it looks
like ooh let's watch the next assault
was solo solo however you say that ma'am
except inking you che that pinky nude to
their solo and then this one is the tea
and cookies so this is sallow by color
pop and then this is teen cookies by
next the liquid suede so it looks like
the solo is a little bit more has a
little bit more of a brown tone where
the Knicks the team cookies a little
more of a pink tone but they're very
similar what is up with that they got
like you know fifteen shades and I got
to pick the same one you guys do that
you pick the same liquid lipstick like
our lipstick or whatever eyeshadow it's
like I got 15 to this shade 15 of the
exact same she like because that's what
you like so you end up buying the same
things over and over again umm al honest
isn't really fair with the court either
tone and she really likes the naked 3
that's good to know I don't have to make
it 300 sexy me oh ok sweet ok so my

yet yeah the where to get is still from
the last episode where i showed the

a while because there's a lot of images
uploads i'll probably take a day or two
to do i'm imagining so but anyway re its
1101 oh my goodness pretty eye palette
for fair skin cargo summer in the city
see now I got to say one more thing okay
I just got this cargo this is the
Northern Lights eyeshadow palette I am
NOT impressed and I love car garage I
have y1 hard oh I shadow palette and I
bought this on a whim with my ass sounds
yeah um yeah with the liquid lipsticks
that I bought and I am not as impressed
with this so far I mean they're hard to
blend they don't last as long as I would
like I was really disappointed in this
but I haven't used it enough to give a
full review on it but I was really sad
but let you know that the summer in the
city I palette is good um let's see oh
it's just twitter it's just okay um let
me see let me see if I can get through
some really quickly I notice a job we
gotta go to the ball I got to get ready
so we can go to the mall and I got it
something I forgot to eat breakfast this
morning because I woke up so late I
didn't have time um let's say I'm going
to talkin to Nicki Make Up For Ever
palette vol 1 has mostly light colors
that's good to know sam says do you
really recommend the ultra matte
lipsticks from colour-pop I saw your
review but wasn't sure like I was saying
a minute ago go to total makeup junkie
wanna once color pop video look at her
swatches hear her opinions and then
decide from there because i think i'll
hit on some good ones just completely by
look so there are some really ones in
there that are not good formula Lily my
friend Lily Spurgeon got some of my
recommendation she said they were a
little too drying for her they're not
drying for me I just put a lip balm of
the room and then I'm fine like I don't
know that's just me i put a lip balm
over them I'm if thats jahmene into I
mean it's for you then you won't like
them and or you know you if you don't
mind drying lipsticks that dry I mean
they dry on to your lips and they don't
moisturize at all I
finally be driving though I just felt
like they got dry you know I'm saying
like i was saying over here with the
with the swatches over here they get dry
they don't stay wet like the arm like
these stay wet the next ones stay wet
where these dry more after overtime this
one's pretty much dry this one's still
little bit wet but they'll be dry soon
but I like the ones that I got I really
like them I can't help it I have to be
honest I like them let's see anything
else I can say really quick jessica says
anyone else Diggle the entire time Jen
does this you search for something while
talking to herself and arguing with
itself it's a single time the things
that you notice that I don't notice I
just I was me I just do what I do that's
funny I think that you're realizing do
it stop all right on that note I'm gonna
get going I gotta go get ready to go to
the mall with Sandra and we're going to
go shop our faces off and i'll probably
post if i buy anything i'll post a
picture on Instagram and the what's up a
makeup appt and i'll post pictures of
Sandra and I at the mall and you might
hit up nordstrom rack too we haven't
decided yet we'll see what to lunch and
everything so it's a me and sandra
meetup me up stair me like it's like
thinking about having like a bunch of
people and like having a meetup where
like I am the focus of the meetup like
that breaks me out like I think that
would be so weird like I would rather
just hang out like one-on-one with you
it's like I don't know like I'm not a
celebrity or like anybody like I don't
see like that just be weird like have
people come to meet me like I don't know
like I can't even stomach that like
that's just odd so I'm going to the mall
with Sandra and we're gonna go hang out
it's not a meet-up it's a lunch you know
like maybe we could do that may be in
the area we can do like a lunch I'm like
picking at my computer screen what is
that is that my microphone what is that
I'm picking at you know but I don't know
I'm gonna have fun standard oh let me
switch over to my screen where I can see
myself wow I look like do do keep my
eyebrows oh my gosh look my swatches oh
