been makeup chat I am so excited to be
here with you this morning I've got my
new ad cup of coffee it has real coffee
in it no faking here drinking my coffee
and we're gonna have some chat and I
haven't gotten a lot of this in my blood
yet so I'm moving a little slow but I'm
hoping that I will be able to get my
life together soon and my thoughts
because I'm a little loopy from the
lease from this much sleep I got last
night so hopefully I don't say some
stupid so stay tuned for me possibly
saying some stupid because it's possible
today it's possible alright going into
the chat window hello to Sammy problem
to step if I was talking to steph on
periscope late last night if you are not
on periscope you need to get on
periscope and follow me over there I was
a little scared because I tried snapchat
snapchat confused me and I don't know if
I'm just too old for snapchat snapchat
I'm just too old for snapchat or what
but I got lost in snapchat but periscope
was super easy it's hooked up with
Twitter so yeah definitely recommend
periscope and it's fun because like I
watched a kid in Africa wash dishes the
other day and that was really cool you
know I watched some guy in Virginia he
plays the piano and he just sits in
plays piano on his periscope him it's
just really cool like a you know walk it
watching people walk down the street in
new york city or in you know italy or
whatever it's really cool so definitely
recommending periscope and then we can
have more chats over there because i'm
doing at least a periscope day recently

just hit the Go button and then you talk

thing that I'm like so dedicated to so

okay flat black MP downside of living
the small town we still haven't gotten a
Lani liquid lipstick so no Christy if
you can't figure out the social medium
15 minutes or less they are doing it
wrong girl not us that is a really good
point that's an excellent point dan says
snapchat makes me feel the same I kind
of feel like I'm just snooping on
someone's day yeah oh my gosh i was
watching patrick star on on periscope
he's one of the only ones that i've seen
that's on there regularly he has like
300 people popping and the man's just in
like he'll just be sitting there like
this eating some dinner and the comments
will just be rolling and you just see
this them just watch in the comments
it's just the weird thing is so weird
you know it's just like sit there I'm
lunch I'm just eat like this is this is
not entertaining not but it is
entertaining reading the comments that
people are writing and he does say
things here here but it's just it's a
very odd format um let's see Alexandria
good morning I was so excited for
generation Katie come up next month me
too I love me and I are the process of
playing our trip I'm so excited I cannot
wait I'm super excited John and I have
to go back and look and make sure we
booked a hotel room we think we did but
we're not a hundred percent sure so we
have to go back and make sure we did
because it's been many many many many
many months since i since I I bought
that ticket because I got far apart of
the really super early bird that was
like fifteen dollar tickets so uh yeah
hopefully we have a hotel room we should
probably check it out considering it's
like exactly like a month away now all
right Diana Jen I'm living on a no bite
until January 2016 on my gosh I get a
free pass for this for twenty percent of
so any suggestions for good things to
splurge on girlfriend I have no idea
like I would hate to even like give you
a suggestion because like products are
so individual for people like there's
things that I would
personally get but they product so
individual for like skin type skin tone
what you like like with you like natural
makeup whether you like bull make up
smokey makeup like I don't I would hate
to even like recommend things girlfriend
oh my gosh I don't know what you have
that's a tough question and plus we
don't even know what's going to be out
by then because by that all holidays
that's gonna be on and we don't even
know like there's so much stuff coming
like suddenly probably don't even know
about it's gonna like go like blow our
minds link we know when we know Oh Diana
you just stretch my brain to the max oh
I have no idea girlfriend I have no idea
that's too much that's a too much
question I can't even handle this off
the Bears girlfriend go with your heart
that's my suggestion is go with your
heart girlfriend Krista sunny and jen i
snagged the whole display to that's so
awesome megan thanks for thanks i felt
bad because i didn't send you anything
about the 21 days of beauty a contact
oulton because i didn't get any sale ads
in the mail you know what's funny is
Tabitha um the are my web designer
Tabitha she sent me an email about 21
days of beauty so I think tabatha for
that and I even think to have it though
in the video tell me I'm always
forgetting about you girlfriend like I
last week and asked me who are my
friends on YouTube he would talk to
regulate and I forgot to mention you I
didn't mention you today his show so I
mentioning you now Tabitha you're
amazing and I love you and thank you you

loads all of the pictures or onto the
website with all of the links she's the
one that uploads the videos to the
website she's keeping the forum going
like I need to shut you out every week
no no I have it and I sincerely
apologize for that because that's kind
of messed up I'm gonna fix that I'm
gonna rectify that all right but at
Kitty beauty I tried snapshot twice and
did not care for it really okay I see

haunting make a powder setting you most
excited for kat von d stuff I'm very
excited for I'm also very excited for
the rock lorac mega Pro to those are the
two men i'm keeping my eye out before
really excited but i want to beef up my
lipsticks you know i don't really need
more lipsticks I just feel like I need
more lipsticks I don't know but this is
the stupid thing about lipsticks like in
lip products they're like all the same
shade there are different shades of this
this ma be pink well there's a red but
I'm he's on that much how many do I
truly I mean like really they're all the
same really shape but out for some
reason I feel the need to be about my
lipstick collection won't even know all
right Mike my family just got home all
right I'm not closer door frustrating
about swamp and I don't even know what
it is but my husband's down there with
them they just come home they're
actually headed to a birthday party I'm
going to meet them there because of chat
oh speaking of that i'm not sure if
chats gonna happen next week because i'm
going to my brother-in-law's wedding and
it's sunday so i don't know if that's
gonna happen i'm gonna try uh but it may
not happen next week i will and also
next week the video the what to make a
video is gonna have to be a slideshow
because i won't be able to film so yeah
so I'm come going up to Bob Pennsylvania
on friday so i don't think i'm going to
be able to do a um like a full-on
phoning and all that so just so you know
ok back to questions Brooke I'm still
waiting for the candy Johnson kat von d
palette i know right i wonder when
that's going to come out and wonder if
they'll do that for the holidays or if
they're going to hold off on that I
don't know yeah but that's gonna be cool
I'm excited to Krista general going I'm
not going to gym baby oh I'm leaving
virginia beach friday night into a
monday so i'm good members of this
oh well hopefully I'll see you at some
event sometime in the future they'll be
awesome blue skies for me please hide in
North Carolina a family North Carolina
and yeah they've lived there my whole
life they've lived in North Carolina my
father's brother um let's say staff I
have a list going of all the holiday
stuff I'm buying this and this is a
problem i know right I'm trying not to
buy as much limited edition like I'm
limiting myself to like just a couple of
things I really really want their
limited edition because they're not good
for the channel no one can get them
later it's kind of dumb but um you know
different things like the kat von d
palette i mean i still use all the time
my Kat Von D felt for two years ago i'm
never getting rid of it that thing's
going to be 10 years old before I part
with it like I don't care i'm not i'm
not getting rid of it it's amazing i'm
not getting rid of it I'm never going to
use it all up it's not going to happen
but I'm never getting rid of it I should
probably show you and use it mostly call
it on is this week this one here you all
remember this one oh my gosh i love this
palette this thing is so fabulous to
have the two color combinations are
supposed to be like quads that you can
use together but i found that they don't
really like this quad is really weird
like I don't use that but I do use the
two shades going across together you're
also supposed to be able to do these
here as well like kind of mixed meshing
with these as well I don't know but I
love this palette I love it it is really
fun just watch this one for you I've
never used this one this is one of the
shades I've never used this one and
gunner ghost watch it for you because
it's really pretty I've never even used
it but now going into fall I should
totally use it it's just like a sparkly
green which I don't own any where else
it's got like blue and green and gold
sparkles in it and it's just it's
amazing so but yeah so I'm trying not to
get any limits as much limited edition
this year
um let's say oh goodness okay okay all
right I live for spinning Jen I have
extremely hooded eyelids and I want to
start wearing makeup my major is
cosmetic science so it'd be nice to look
the part you have any tips or tricks for
a beginner now I don't have hooded lids
Melissa Raymond or miss audrey has a lot
of videos on hooded eyelids I don't have
them one thing I've noticed about people
with hooded eyelids is that the wing
often looks um misplaced because you
don't have um you can't really see where
where the eyeliner is sometimes
depending on how couldn't your eyelid is
so like a lot of people hooded eyelids
the wing doesn't look quite right so if
you're going to do eyeliner do the
eyeliner but then keep your wing really
small to start off with because I feel
like you know and see how it fits on
your particular hooded eyes the other
thing is as far as your crease like
people are always thinking up to create
their crease you don't necessarily need
to worry about that quite as much
because you're not going to see your
crease as much um so really focusing on
accentuating your lid and brightening up
your lid is going to be essential for
you at least from the videos that I've
watched lower lash line is a place that
you can rock it where you know get
neutral colors on your upper lash line
and wait sorry like a brown or black i'm
not sure what your hair color is on your
upper lash line and the neutral
eyeshadow and mascara and then rock a
bold bright color on your lower lash
line and your eyes would pop you look
amazing because you gotta work at
girlfriend got to work it so that's what
just for my limited knowledge of hooded
eyes my suggestion would be I don't know
if that's reasonable and not to my
periscope is um it's kicking right now
this guy i just found randomly he's a
guy that plays piano he's at a church
breakfast right now so i could i can
listen to him playing his piano at a
church breakfast if i wanted to maybe
he's playing and he's talking i don't
know um alright but definitely if you
there's plenty of youtube videos on
hooded eyes Melissa archery
some great ones though all right Kyla
says she wishes she had Canada over and
see me at CBS in Canada yeah I know um
Oh see new vice palette looks amazing oh
my gosh how did you just do a swatch of
you I'm not palette how did you get a
girlfriend how all these people get this
palette I want that kind of stuff I want
to be able to review stuff before

really that's some craziness deepa says
it's in the end cool man I all I want to
go to India one day I really do like the
it's just the there are parts of India
just look amazing my friend Mary Lynn
has been any unchi show me pictures and
just I want to go so bad and I get
scared of places that nobody speaks
English like because I get scared I'm
gonna fail miserably in figuring things
out when people don't speak English and
i'm pretty sure in india there's enough
people that speak english that i think i
would be ok but oh my gosh I would love
to go to NBA one day alright Bad Kitty
BTW this is my first time i am up before
noon on a sunday to be here for this
thank you so much oh you were too sweet
thank you lastly i got about 4 430 but
the baby we've been up since we'll
probably take a nap after this one more
coffee all Amy Jen why does it take um
take you so long to do the news well it
takes a long time to do the news because
I have to gather all the information
from everywhere I can show you guys what
one of my sweat my script looks like let
me pull it up and then I'll show you
what it looks like so you can see like
what I do like the behind the scenes you
show you my notes for this week ok so
let me do a little screen sharing with
you let's go back to the screen sharing
hopefully we'll be able to do this I can
show you what I have to do so my
reporter said me um my reporters sent me
their reports and then I transferred
them to my script which takes a really
long time so let me show you what that
looks like ok hopefully you can see that
here so this is my script they the top
news I kind of compile out of what I
think is most exciting that goes first
and then I have a bold part where i put
i switch to transition so all of this is
what i read from while i'm on camera so
there's all the alts stuff ok along with
that i have all of the screen captures
that need to be done my reporters send
me pictures sometimes they need to be
cropped so most of the time they don't
but sometimes they need to be cropped so
i have to crop the picture as i have to
label the
means um so that takes a really long
time but this is the script that's how
that looks you stop actually here and
then I can show you let me see if I have
that's videos need to see if I can show
you pictures oh no that's not what I
want to be on being videos 2015
September and then here's all the
pictures so all of these need to be
captured and cropped so that takes a
really long time to do and then once all
of that is done then i can actually film
at once i film filming takes me about
and ask me about an hour to film and
then after i film that i have editing so
i have to trim out all of my owns and
ahhs all of my mistakes trim all of that
out and then after I trim everything
down then I have to answer all of the
pictures inserting each picture I have
to resize it so that it fits on the side
of the frame so that takes a long time
to do i also have to insert of course
the music the intro the outro i have to
cut take the video from last week and
inserted into the end cut it up into
pieces to that I've got that little tag
at the end of the video and it just it
takes a really long time the longest
thing that the thing that takes along
this is number one the script takes
forever and then inserting of the
pictures and resizing all of them takes
forever and then every one small realize
that I didn't capture a picture so then
I have to oh no you didn't see anything
oh that makes me sad I'm sorry I just
got a text message from I'll yesenia she
said you didn't see anything that makes
me sad well anyway script is long you
missed a lot of words on a page actually
you know what I have it I can show it to
you right now this is the script so it
starts off here this is the up to here
was the the beginning and then this is
the YouTube section and so I have to
compile all of this this is a
particularly long one
so this is this was I have to get all
this together takes a really long time
so it's about a 10 to 15 hour week job
just that one video so that's why I have
trouble putting up other videos is
because from Thursday through Sundays
there's really early Sunday morning is
completely dedicated to be working on
once at the makeup I don't have any
other time to work on any other videos
so i have to really focus on monday
through wednesday working on other
videos and making sure that they're up
but sometimes i have things for my
regular job to do on those days so I
can't so that's why it's hard to create
other content but that's enough on that
topic I've been daddy about that for a
while so sorry you couldn't see the rest
of that I know you guys are probably
commenting I can't see you anything then
you too i'm using you for letting me
know that you couldn't see anything I
appreciate that um alright so hopefully
that kind of showed you a little behind
the scenes of what I do for what's the
makeup and why I takes a long time
alright and then somebody told me last
who was it was somebody that's hear
something last night was like you know
you can anything with Shannon was like
you know you can put it up the day late
and I was like no I can no I can't but

Lindsey have been off youtube for so

good it's so good to be back to your

have you back on Krista also today is
starting a bunch of sales at Ulta
including the lorac alter ego lipsticks
for ten dollars mmm that's good to know
thank you so much Krista Kyla are you
planning any
holiday items I really want to get the
kat von d the one that looks like a
rainbow wheel and I really want to get
the mega pro 2 from lorac there's the
two that I've had my eyes on we shall
see misamis says I'm so angry with Alton
decided to place an order arrange to
have it delivered to a us address but it
turns out they won't even take my
canadian credit card that is annoying
wheeling that's messed up um nordling fo
snapchat is just having a quick
marketing push because they're being
overtaken by the far superior periscopes
who don't sweat it hopefully because i
like periscope more thing i don't like
about periscope is the periscope breaks
up sometimes where it kind of goes in
and out like I was watching I found this
one guy I just randomly click on people
and every once among my find somebody
that it's like I end up following this
guy he's like a business dude like he
and some lives in an apartment in
California and he like does like like
stocks and stuff but he cracks me up
he's so funny and like he always talks
to the people when they come into the
the whenever the periscope he always
like call people out I'm like hey Jen
you're here hello and then he like he
does like motivational talking and
things like that and i really like um
watching him but the other day he was
like cutting in and out in and out and
in and out no super annoying like what
is going on so periscopes gonna have to
fix of things especially as they have
more people coming to join their service
because when you go on there you'll see
unlike the central east coast like 56
people live that's going to go way up if
I you know if tabatha and I are on the
same path when thinking periscopes going
to get get pretty big like you're going
to have to beef up whatever it is
they're doing as far as servers or
however apps work because hmm i don't
like when I breaks up Megan says to face
is my favorite high end makeup company
me to their brawn this way foundation is
great I like it too but they're
porcelain is way too yellow from you
hope you have a better match when the
newer shades come out I hope so too they
do have quite a few shades but um I
don't imagine I'm going to come out
more I know they came out with a second
batch of new shades but that was awhile
ago she probably didn't find the right
shape for you and he said it's your
super super pale I thankful that I had
got one that is close enough to my shame
this is the one I got with epson points
and this is in the shade light beige and
I actually did the Ipsy matching thing
and they did not match me at this color
but I really like this color it's a nice
color I feel their fortune that I'm of a
neutral skin tone so that if it's a
little bit the pulls a little bit cool
or warm it's okay like I feel like I can
still pull it off or maybe I can't and I
just think I can um alright let's see
Nikki kat von d made a comment on her
Instagram that the original lolita is
coming back in twenty sixteen called OG
lolita that's interesting I don't have
to let um Lily know because Lily was
upset because lily has the original one
and then she got the new one and she's
like why these are so different when she
has swatches of them and everything
where there are they're quite different
that's interesting I wonder why they
would call it the same thing and then
like the same name but change the color
why didn't I not just change the name
why call it lolita if it's not the same
color I don't know or maybe it was a
mistake maybe they thought they were
making the original color and they
matched her nowt wrong and they just
rolled with it no dad says Nix just came
to my towns local pharmacy and my friend
like bought three lipsticks without even
thinking they do have nice lipsticks I
like their matte lipsticks wait do i
wait or a bed maybe I don't I thought I
like that lipsticks and then I realized
that they they break up on my lips like
they don't they don't go on smoothly so
now don't like them much I guess obvious
one let's get there was sometimes what
was a little I like that Mick's the wait
now I'm confused honor that it's not the
lipsticks it's a it's the lip creams
that break up on me that don't go on
smoothly it's not the lipsticks it's a
lip creams I like the lipsticks I don't
like the lip creams as far as going on
smoothly but if you have really nice
lips they don't have like craziness like
mind you you'll probably still like the
matte ones the matte lip creams
I just don't like them because my lips
are never in good condition like I don't
care whatever I do my lips are never in
good condition I use organic lip balms I
use lip scrubs never it's like my one
thing that I have issues with like my
skin is pretty good my you know I don't
know my under eyes aren't too terrible
like but my lips or hot mess and my hair
my hair has serious issues I need to get
my hair done so bad but even want to get
my hair done I still get comments about
I need to get my hair cut even after you
get my hair done I don't know can't
please everybody all the time right all
right uh chef with us give me some words
thank you dear Tara says I'm very
excited for the new color pop collection
forever freshman him back to cool anyone
else means because I went to college in
the 90 so it makes me so nostalgic I was
334 clock in the morning last night I
almost went with the colour-pop website
in balsam because i was looking at the
pictures from the show and I was like I
really want some of these I just saw a
young on and polished came up with a
video with swatches and all that so I'm
gonna watch her video and then decide
what I want to get I don't think I'm
gonna be able to resist I really like
color pop products I hate to admit it
when I do and they've never sent me a
single thing they don't know who i am
but i really like their products I can't
help it nothing I don't like is there
glittery eye shadows but people tell me
there's ways to work with them you know
primers and sprays and all this stuff I
don't want to eat all that it's too much
that's too much work I'd rather do
something that works without having
these tons of primers and sprays and all
that kind of stuff so um but i love the
libby six i love them i do an Olympic
pencils are nice too i just put a lip
balm of room so that they're not dry and
I just wear them straight like that so
yeah I think I'm gonna have to buy some
I think I'm gonna have to I think it's
gonna have to happen do I need it no I
just really want some and I haven't
bought anything in September yet i
solved my budget for September so I
think that's going to be part of it
let's say terrorize talk about with mom

you would have had no sleep thanks
Shannon all right by family I love you
I'll see you in about 10 30 minutes or
so as soon as I'm getting off here
exactly at 11 and then I'll see you
there all right thank you love you oh
don't forget to give slip it's in the
bag all right who go Bruin just went
through here little job is going after
my texts I don't know why I'm thought a
zigzag sit here and then we see
something like that he's like all right
but Shannon so good to see you i was
talking to shannon on periscope last
night a burka this is random but i was
on inside edition you were right inside
a dish in the other day
happen I want to hear that story Lindsey
I he just cleared loads of mine out i
had so much but hardly use them but i
adore my lip products but i only wear
gloss to the salon yeah you know I feel
like loss doesn't last very long I have
been all about doing the liquid
lipsticks from colour-pop because they
seriously last all day long it's the
only lip product I've ever use that I'm
happy with hours later like it fades so
nicely like the ones that i have i know
the formula varies from lipstick to
lipstick and some of them are don't work
quite as well but the ones that i have i
really like them a lot and I can't lie I
can't like they're my favorite formula
right now I want to get more of the
steel ones but the problem with the
steel ones they don't have a big enough
shade range and a lot of them aren't
wearable like work colors for me so I
can't try them as much I can't test them
as much because I can't wear a math at
those I know people say unique and wear
bright lip sticks out of the house where
I don't need to necessarily useful for
filming but I just feel weird going out
of a house with like bright shades like
I've got these two hot sauce the ones
i've worn these each one time because
they're just so stinking bright and I
just don't like I feel weird wearing
that on my lips out of the house it's
just too much like neon and this one
they're just like like why don't they
make wearable shades you know what I'm
saying like there's just no there might
be there might be wearable shades of
these but I just didn't because maybe
they were sold out but I can't wear
those out of the house man like really
like neon anyway so I usually been
wearing the color pop wants to work
because they last all day um but lip
gloss only lasts like a hot min and I
mean I have to keep reapplying and I
still have time for that business i'm at
work I dance as I don't know if it got
was discussed but what does everyone
think of the Jacqueline hell removing
affiliation with Gerard cosmetics you
know I don't know the backstory of why
we can we can all guess why she removed
her affiliation with drew our cosmetics
but we don't really know why um you know
I I don't want to go into it too much
because it's a lot of assumptions and
things and I'm not going to assume you
what happens when you assume but I will
tell you a funny story about George
cosmetics very quickly I got a comment
on one of my videos last night this a
401 where where John my when it was
before and they wouldn't let me film and
I got a comment on my video and how was
a what is going on with this I have to
read this to you okay it's right here it
was put to a screencap of it and I sent
it to Lily it says well the irony is
just too much you are complaining about
customer service but you obviously lack
the knowledge of and or you just don't
have any respect for others uid or have
just gotten a dose of your own poison
the only difference is that the dose you
gave was lethal to the longevity demise
and prosperity and lack thereof of your
toxic cosmetics you can't take what you
give out you reap what you sow
furthermore from looking at this video
of you you have absolutely no round to
stand on to call anyone ugly find a
mirror in a room with true light and
take a good look at yourself honey you
are nothing to look at and by the way
get your ends clipped your hair is a
disaster I guess you could say that what
you have going on is a cohesive look lol
hysterically girlfriend thinks I'm Jen
Gerard I read this and I was like pax
pax and like there's a there's a comment
from Jenna Jenna's and chat right now
it's she says blew my mind roller lash
was my holy grail because that was you
know it was in the comment section where
I see all my comments from all my videos
so i responded to her I was like I don't
know what I did to deserve this kind of
comment like reap what you sow and you
know like respect for others and dose of
your own poison like who wasn't even
talking about and then I went I went to
her page and I saw she had watched Tina
Marie who's actually a new a friend of
mine I follow her and she follows me um
you know it's she washed into our
cosmetics video about you know what had
happened with man emu ain't all that I
was like I made the connections that she
thinks I'm Jen Gerard but totally thinks
i'm generating just smash the way that I
look because she thinks that i'm john
Gerard and what irony of that is I had
just gotten my haircut right before I
went to I match which was when that
video was filmed so I didn't need to get
my edge trim my hair
really really super thin so it looks a
little frizzy at the end sometimes like
it I mean I can't put wheels and things
in my ear but only last X amount of
hours and then it just goes back to
looking like you know shredded hey or
whatever so anyway like I was completely
like baffle like confused about this
comment and I was like oh my gosh but
anyway so now I got a taste of what jen
has to deal with after that whole fiasco
I mean she kind of did it to herself I
didn't deserve that you know from what
she did to Karina but you know I don't
know well i mean it's it's long it's
more complicated than she did it to
herself it's way more coffee than that
because you know she may have not known
he was snapping oz if anyone in the back
story of that search for Karina kaboom
and you'll find the whole story so
anyway as far as jaclyn hill removing
affiliation from droid cosmetics i'm
sure she has her reasons she is not a
shortage of people wanted to collaborate
with her so she's not going to lose out
from it lindsay may be a challenge to
wit may be a challenge to wear a
different lip product every day yeah
that is a good idea that's a good idea
amy says yet how much do you think uh
Kat Von D lipstick like how much do I
think they are or what do I think of
them I haven't ever tried them so I
don't know and off the top of my head
I'm not sure how much they cost because
for website you should be able to find
out Christy says what's your favorite
favorite brush to use with color PO I
shows I don't and use my fingers I use
my fingers ipad non and then i blend it
with whatever regular brushes that have
um but I don't use brushes with the
color pops um if they just don't work
then work so I use my fingers I don't
know how many more eyeshadows i'm going
to buy from them because i think that's
my least favorite of the things that
I've gotten from them I think I'm gonna
step to lip products because that's when
most favorite from them kyla says I
don't have a super amount of lipsticks
because I'm still in high school and I'm
afraid of them going bad yeah I don't
blame you I don't blame you you should
need for all that he says no varies
thank you Amy I guess saying it says I
just got um I just urban decay not 293
lipstick and liner oh I'm in love oh I
bet that looks really good on you and
your skin tone Nicole Nicole
oh I just got a whole catalog of all
those 21 days in beauty in the mail
yesterday nice Diana Jenna everyone less
I might warrant color public order
arrived postage due they were really
nice and refunded my postage well that's
nice that's good goodness LeAnn oh my
gosh or make me feel way over with all
this talk of going to school in the 90s
LOL i was in college in the 80s oh wow
okay that's cool man I was um well I'm
make you feel old I graduate high school
and 96 I'm actually about to have my
20-year highschool reunion they're
planning it right now I'm supposed to be
involved in it I was class treasurer
it's best to be involved in the planning
but I haven't really been there helping
much but she's recruited like our class
secretary has has recruited like 30
people to help which is awesome so that
means less for me to do because I got so
much going on time for my business I
helped to organize the 10 year but it's
too much I don't know if that's gonna
happen all right Chris the gin and
everyone lipstick sets for the holidays

wolves mouth halo coven sex or
bachelorette neon and noble think you're
talking about the kat von d ones i think
yes I think those are the kat von d with
the lipsticks then whatever studded
lipsticks Ilana says do you ever wear
dramatic makeup for work like darker
makeup or bold lip I have and it doesn't
go well it's not a good idea people look
at me like I'm crazy because a lot of
people that I work with don't wear any
makeup to work so yeah it's a very
casual school this is Jen what are you
most excited about for the 21 days of
beauty the two-faced lipsticks
definitely no question about it Nicki I
got to 21 days of beauty
ordered pushes the app last Sunday you

you're always on top of that app
girlfriend and I appreciate it so much
Madison good morning to you the Coco
Chanel Jim what is your favorite to face
shade that is the event i'm most excited
about as well do you go to ulta okay
let's answer that one first I'm a
chocolate there's a chocolate chocolate
right here this is my favorite this is
my baby i love this one and it's perfect
for the trends perfect perfect perfect
this was the amor solid color that they
recommended at sephora when the marsala
thing was really big at the beginning of
the year this was one of the recommended
lip colors that you couldn't get the one
that was actually the Pantone color vr1
they recommended this one it's amazing I
have a naked dolly this one is really
light so i usually use this one on top
of other ones i don't typically wear
that one by itself it's really nice to
pair with something that's a little
brighter to kind of dull it down and
then this one is called naughty mood i
love this one love me some naughty nude
it's um it's a really nice just neutral
shade very very nice I love that one
this one this is NARS is Dolce Dolce
Vita and you can see it's a little bit
more opaque naked dolly but it's pretty
much the same shade those are machines
any of them it would be pink chocolate
absolutely but I want more let's say
okay next question do you go into ulta
or shop online both maybe we'll run into
each other since I lived on Andrews Air
Force Base cool man my grandfather used
to work on Andrews Air Force Base he was
a chef or cook I Andrews Air Force Base

Michigan I think I'm going to bite the
bullet and get the giorgio armani
luminous silk foundation i had a couple
of two examples i used every drop so so
pricey what do you think i don't know
anything about it it is famous I'm sure
for a reason though um do is your person
my girl Lily who's not in here who
should be because I knew
she's awake we'll probably be able to
tell you a little bit better about that
she's my high-end girl she knows all
about that stuff um but I don't know if
you liked it though and that stuff
foundations last a hot minute so if you
have money to splurge on it and you
really liked it I say go for it step
says star wars ones from what I've seen
are very frosty they did look frosty
didnae that's why I want to see him in
person I don't want to look at it Nikki

see Megan anyone heard of EPP rivage I
haven't all right it is one minute I'm
gonna try off Thank You Shannon for
posting that link you are amazing nicole
says loved for Jane Jane is amazing I
was wonderful real name was Jane or if
that was just the play on words she
doesn't ever say her name I just have to
assume name is Jane Nikki Jen you prefer
for us to post on the app or the website
I think you do what makes you happy I
prefer for you to post wherever you like
whatever format is what is fun for you
some people prefer a form some people
before prefer the Instagram format so
it's whatever whatever you want to do
I'm going to try to spread myself
everywhere as much as I can try to
spread myself out what I'm going to do
is I need a dedicated day for each
social media so like making sure I post
on Instagram one day posting on you know
that the website one day the app another
day and like you know try to have like a
schedule when I post on everything so
that everything gets hit at least once a
week
cuz I have a post on Instagram like two
weeks it's not good um Tabitha's like ah
I know right alright uh Amy Jen I
thought on the app okay you're gonna
give me some advice I hope so tell me
what you look what you think all right
indique anyone hello jen i love you i
love you too how do you put blush on
really round chipmunk cheeks girlfriend
you just gotta like honestly like the
way that I would do it is go from the
back to the front so you don't end up
with Clown cheeks right here like you
know and then blend in it blend in a
girlfriend and do something that's
closer to your skin tone to start off
with like for example your blush I have
some that are really close to my skin
tone like this is a lobster lovestruck
bro yeah lovestruck blush and sweet pea
pink from Jake a beauty this is really
close to my skin tone it's not too far
away let me see if I can so like
something that isn't going to be super
bowl to start off with and they get used
to something like this and then get
something a little brighter also don't
be afraid of blushes that are deeper
toned for fall especially because these
can be absolutely beautiful this is the
Mary Kay blush in sheer bliss and don't
be afraid of colors like that darker
colors from look really really beautiful
another option this is Eve pearl this is
a really nice place to start these are
kind of expensive though I got it on
discounted I matched two years ago this
is um it goes with your skin tone so
this one is the light one and you can
use all three like you can use this one
on your cheekbones this one above and
this one slightly below is a little bit
of a contour or you can just sweep them
all together but this one's really nice
this backhoe one is really nice and
sweet pea as far as something that's
looks it looks dark but it's really not
that dark to go on it looks more like a
very light like a pinky bronzer I'm see
like you can't even see it hardly like
do something like that something it
doesn't pop from your cheeks don't go
with something like this clown face wow
thanks and then just start from the back
because that's where you have the most
products and then pull forward
that way you don't end up with that pop
right on your cheeks hopefully that
helps I hope so cross my fingers all
right last one because I think this is
going to skip me down and it's 11 0 3
Christmases Jen oh I'm here forgot to
tag you five shades of KVD star-studded
lipsticks are ten dollars at JCP sephora
no way oh my gosh it's on our instagram
follow Krista over it on my monthly
obsessions on Instagram and it looks
like let me see if I can scroll down a
little bit ah no it died okay um
Christie and this actually scroll down
too far Christie says I'm cleaning a
sponge should have washed out any eggs
but there's bugs guy hits this one place
oh you're talking about the any blender
I don't know if that girl planted those
bugs in the beauty blender I don't know
if I believe those bugs got in there and
made a home and she's actually had it
for a little bit before she before that
if you noticed there was bugs in it so
they need to come for her from her house
or something I don't know I'm just
saying I don't know if you look at her
the rest of her video she has a lot of
shopping things like you know bug on my
mom's back and like you know we're just
the thumbnail itself like it all seems
pointed like she did it on purpose you
know like I don't know I don't know if I
trust that it's real I'm skeptical I'm
skeptical see there's anything oh
there's Lily hi Lily ah let's see Lily
says cooks on the App stop it Lily top
of the worked really hard on the website
the app and the website both another
fighting Lily some sort brain fart she
meant to say west java the years if I hi

says on the forum you don't need a photo
but you can include them if you want and
the info will be around longer that's
very true that's
very true i think it's just it's just
two different formats whatever makes you
comfortable so it's whatever makes you
happy if you like the app format go on
the app I mean some things you may want
to post on the app because it's a
picture and you know you know I look in
the day or whatever and you feel like
it's better for the app and then some
things maybe you just have a question
about a product or you just want to rave
about a product you don't have a picture
and you just want to talk about it then
I'll be best for the website so I mean
it's whatever makes you happy you can do
both um but anyway all right I gotta get
going I gotta go to this birthday party
it's 1105 and my family is going to be
like where ever you know so I hope you
guys have a wonderful week and I don't
know if I'm going to see you in chat
next week or not just because of the
wedding I'm gonna try though it just
depends on not sure what time the
wedding starts or if it's even gonna be
possible for me to do chat because the
wedding cuz if the wedding is you know
ten o'clock there's no way I can need a
wedding for my brother-in-law and inch
at the same time so I'll have to play by
ear I will keep you posted on social
media i'm sure i'll be talking about in
on periscope I'll put something up on
Instagram when I know and Twitter I'm
Jen lowes reviews every everywhere
there's no numbers there's no weirdness
is just the gin loss reviews I'm not on
Facebook a whole lot I'll try to
remember to put something on facebook as
far as chat and the video for next week
as far as what's happening I'll try
remember the facebook is not really my
favorite one I know some people really
love facebook but it's not your thing
girl friend you got to go for the
facebook no one's got to do their own
thing and what makes them happy anyway
now I love my friends hopefully I'll see
you next week if not i'll see you week
afterward and that love how wonder awake
