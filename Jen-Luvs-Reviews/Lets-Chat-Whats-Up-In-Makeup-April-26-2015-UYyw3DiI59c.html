here with you this beautiful Sunday
morning it is gorgeous outside so after
this I'm definitely going outside it is
so beautiful out I hope you enjoyed the
show this morning I'm very excited about
the new products that are coming out and
I'm excited to talk with you about them
now first thing I wanted to mention the
YouTube has changed up the live chat
situation where it used to be that you
would leave comments under the video now
there's like a streaming chat over on
the side so I've been doing a little bit
differently if you're responding to
somebody else I probably won't talk
about what you're saying because it
drags the chat and then I can't mention
as many questions so what I'll do is
I'll kind of leave through and then
focus on the ones that look like they're
like new questions but if you're like
talking back to somebody I probably
won't say it just so that we can keep it
going so let me go ahead and go back
over to where I can see all of me all
the chat the chat window and everything
um hold on just a second live events
just give me a second to get there alive
can let me see up right here okay
hopefully this is what okay I don't see
the chat window this week I don't know
what's going on with that okay well I
guess we don't have the chat window this
week I guess I have the comments this
week youtube can't make up their mind
what they wanted to with this so I'm
going to be refreshing comments i guess
this week let's say okay so there were a
few comments the questions that came in
before the chat started the first one
was from leah kitty hi Leah have you
tried any perfectly posh products and if
so what a good thoughts i have not i
don't believe those are available in the
US I don't know maybe I just don't know
but if they're you know anywhere that
they are available in the US or if
there's a place that I could try them or
if you have any favorite products let me
know laura says good afternoon from UK
Jen did you get a chance to check out
sugar pill cosmetics at imats with their
new nail lacquers worth checking out I
out there I shot worth checking out
their eye shadow pigments amazing okay
so with sugar pill I walked over there
and i swatched the new I didn't wash
them I open them up just to kind of see
the consistency all the girls
working there all the women they're
working they're all had them on their
nails and just didn't look like my style
it's kind of like a creamy milky kind of
look with so speckles and it just didn't
look like something that I was
interested in so i did not get any as
far as their eyeshadows their eyeshadows
are crazy bright and just as a teacher
and a mom like i know they're amazing
but their shade range just isn't my
personal taste so i know that they are
really nice shadows I just they're not
my personal taste so I haven't really
looked into them all right Jill says
what are your favorite essence products
as far as essence goes I haven't tried a
ton of products from essence there's one
product that I really like and you'll
see you can't even tell it's really from
essence anymore and this is the stay um
stays no matter what eyeliner and this
is the only not my favorite eyeliner of
all time but this was one that I really
liked a lot for a little while um I
don't know I mean I guess I really I had
a lot of fun with this product before I
had ones that I like better you know I'm
saying it's like a like a squishy marker
type it's not a brush marker type it's
like a sharpie marker type it draws a
nice line Lee seven get you to show you
it draws a really nice line the only
thing that I had issues with this is it
does seep into my fine lines just a tad
tad bit just a tad bit and I've liners
that don't do that it does have a really
really nice lasting power but if you do
go like this on your eye it will go away
so this is the only product that I have
liked from essence that tried I've heard
lots of good things about their own some
of their mascaras about their some of
their eyeshadows I tried their eyelash
the one that lengthens your eyelashes
like a powder and I did not care for
that product so those are the ones that
I've tried hopefully that helps your
cold blank hi from Philly i just
finished what's up in makeup
unfortunately we'll have to watch most
this later but at least i get to catch
some of it live i love your channel
you're awesome jen thanks for this love
these live chats thank you so much
nicole i love doing the live chats to
their super fun shannon says good
morning from alabama how do you
determine what moisturizer primer and
foundation go together and not flake off
or crumble on your face I don't really
have that problem um
I don't know maybe it's because I have
normal skin I don't have problem skin at
all but I don't really have that problem
I just kind of pick a foundation like a
primer like if I thought my skin feels
dry I pick a moisturizing one if I feel
like it's doing pretty good it's pretty
hydrating that day I'll use a silicone
based primer and then I describe
whatever foundation I want I'm sorry I
can't answer that question maybe someone
else can help Shannon with that but I
haven't had that problem with foundation
flaking off and crumbling on my face
wonder what foundation that is that
you're using it's doing that I'm curious
o'grady says good morning everyone good
morning Grady good to see you hon all
right let's say okay we refreshing the
comments ok go back down to Grady
where's Grady there you are okay
Victoria says hey good morning from New
York did you try the Maybelline pal with
all the crazy colors ok I think that's
the one that's no no I haven't tried
that one um but I filmed a review of the
bluffs nudes of the actual review of a
blush nudes and the lapel a nude one and
I have some videos have to go before
that that pellets okay he and I've heard
I've heard similar things about all the
Maybelline tell that they're kind of
some people really like them but most
people seem to be kind of like yeah
they're all right you can work with them
but they're nothing like to scream about
you know what I'm Sam my blankies clerks
yay I didn't know to Samba 22 did makeup
I didn't know they existed I think I'm
impressed that you know where they are I
think it's a korean brands it's
definitely an asian brain but i'm not
sure which country i think they might be
Korean or Japanese I can't remember she
says I'll have to see when I go to
Sephora they have any in stock I've
tried to gel moisturizer by them that I
received in a meanie box and it was my
oh my go to last summer oh that's cool
they're pretty expensive as far as
creams go so wonder what their makeup
runs i forget i know that you can find
that eyebrow product on the sephora
website i don't remember how much it was
actually I have it right here huh I have
my notes for what's up and make up here
these are the notes that i have this is
what i read off of let's say where is it
okay the sephora notes where's the
sephora notes
it probably does say no I didn't copy
down of course of all all the products
at prices except for that one sorry fail
alright let's see um let's see Jill says
hi Jen I love you so much I love you too
much to so much and that's too much so
much so much too much so much too much
oh I can't edit that out leavin says hi
jen i love you channel it seem like your
ims experience was hitting this but i
enjoying you taking us along thank you
so much Lee Anya I mostly had a great
time there was very few moments of not
greatness and that's a form as it is
coming up that was not greatness good
morning Jen from Gina hello gina muscato
says good morning from Texas missed you
the past couple weeks I miss you too
Tyler says the money from Texas I can't
figure out the type to tightline without
my eyes wandering you have any
recommendations maybe I'm using the
wrong pencil I think it's one of those
things too it's your your body's natural
reaction when you put something in your
eyes is to water so I think maybe as you
get used to it maybe you'll stop
watering as much also of course make
sure your pencil is nice and sharp
there's any kind of wood or anything you
know sticking out that's going to be
very bad but i think it's just you know
your natural body protecting you from
whatever it is you're putting in your
eye how bad is the eye watering thing
like i would imagine that would be very
disruptive to the process of trying to
tighten life is just wash all off and
down your face um yeah for tight lining
at the one that I like the best is my
new water 1 i've got a ton of eyeliners
over here on if i'll be able to find it
but it's fine you are and it's i got it
at the birchbox website we see if i can
find it quickly it should be in this
little compartment but sometimes i'm
going too fast and I don't put it back
in the right spot at one more section
and then if I can't find it I'll give up
may I get it at the bar CH box website
and it's the best tightlining eyeliner
ever of course it's not in here okay
it's like mixed in somewhere somewhere
oh I want to fight it I don't want to
give up I don't want to give up I don't
wanna hear it is yeah I found it okay I
don't know I've never been to war
website or anything to see whether it
exists but this is the new arm pencil
and it's just super creamy and amazing
and Matt and opaque and just fabulous
awesome alright let's see who's next all
right Holly says good morning dear Jen I
am on and unfortunately necessary no bye
but I still hang out and live
vicariously I've done no byes and
they're there they're tough man they're
really tough I try really hard like
April I was trying really hard not to
buy anything except for at imats that
was kind of my restriction was I mats
that I could buy what I wanted I mess
but that was it and I did pretty good i
did pretty good in april but having a
channel i tend to buy more stuff but i'm
trying really hard not to buy things
that don't have anything to do with the
channel let's see alexis says hi i love
your videos was warning if you like
pixie products either had so a lot of
mixed reviews warning what your thoughts
are on them love you Alexa okay so pick
C products I started off with a very
much hate relationship with pixie I
absolutely hated their eyeshadows I got
a palette off of hope look it was my
first hautelook purchase and it was his
gorgeous neutral palette it was really
big it was beautiful the shadows were
not pigmented they were terrible Oh bad
if she started putting pixie products in
FC bags and I let I didn't like any of
those either but then in i guess the
past year or so I feel like they've
really been stepping up their game
especially with their lip products um
they're cheap products I'm not as
impressed with and their eye shadow
products are hit or miss with me I
haven't tried any of their mascaras but
I would say if you're going to try any
from pixie I would shoot for a lip
product first and see how you like it
but honestly it's not my favorite brand
at all like I'm not I would never go
into target and buy pics you on purpose
because I just don't trust the brands
and they've had too many misses for me
but
a lot of people do enjoy their products
I just don't I'm not a big fan Grady
Byrd hike rainy hello Jen I could have
jumped up and down for joy when I saw
the Estee Lauder Double Wear sephora
deal on what's up and make up this
morning since you gave me that advice
last time question for you oh yeah
because she's getting married and I told
her to get that for her wedding a
question for you and everyone if you had
to choose one organizational item for
your makeup what would you recommend
nail polish rack acrylic drawers etc I'm
trying to reorganize thanks ok this is
so cliche this is so like not cliche
cliches planteth right word but this is
so predictable but I love my Alex
drawers I know that's lean but I do i
love my Alex drawers i have the nine
drawer here a nine drawer here and then
a five drawer here and i made like a
desk out of it and I know that's what
everybody uses but I love my Alex
drawers I do I mean even like one of the
five drawers yeah five drawers they're
pretty awesome I I really like that um
my nail polish racks i really like to i
got those off of amazon if you just
Google nail polish rack and you see the
plastic ones they're all pretty much the
same I think they're like 80 bucks or
something though they're expensive and
then the no they're not I'm sorry there
are like thirty dollars i think and then
the alex stores are kind of pricing and
you can you don't get there like two
hundred ollar zip them ship you have to
have a and i can your new or else it's
just not worth it but um but yeah that
would be my two things if I had to pick
anything on pick Alec stores okay
Christine says you have any go to
foundation from the drugstore and I
think I mentioned this last but not
everybody will come every week awesome
on my favorite drugstore foundation
right now is the Maybelline fit me matte
and poreless but if you have any bit of
dry skin do not buy this it does not
work for people with dry skin it sticks
dry patches and a serum of people with
dry skin but I really like this one a
lot my second favorite one is the Loreal
infallible Pro max this one seems to be
a little more Universal for people but I
don't like this one as much because it
doesn't match my skin tone as well as
this one like there's a slight shade
difference i don't know if you can see
but this one is a little bit more pink
toned so I like this one better just
because of that so it's a general
recommendation this I think works better
for more people
alright Sarah says good morning from
Kansas City I just picked up the laura
mercier are too I are we laura mercier I
art artists palette and i love it i
heard such good things about that girl
if you don't have it you gotta check it
out perfection I've heard wonderful
things about that palette I don't know
if I'm gonna get it because I just I
have a pallet problem and you're not
helping Sara but you know I want to
swatch it I'll swatch it because I do i
I've heard wonderful things all right
Caroline says what are some products
that are discontinued that you want back
discontinued that you want back I can't
think of anything it's discontinued this
is a thing like I feel like everything
has been replaceable like everything
that's been discontinued everything that
is going on I feel like it's been
replaceable there's nothing that's been
discontinued that I cry every day about
I don't know I'd be curious to know what
y'all think about things that um then
been discontinued that you cry still cry
that it's discontinued and they don't
run out of a lot of stuff so because I'm
constantly rotating through this
ridiculous stupid amount of stuff so
yeah I don't really have one Caroline
but that was a really great question all
right Jill says favorite elf products I
don't use a whole lot elf honestly the
lip exfoliator is probably my absolute
favorite um but I can't think of
anything else elf that I actually reach
for and pick up and it's not because
it's inexpensive it's just because it's
just there's so many misses from that
brand that I just don't spend money on
it and I have so much other stuff unless
there's something new out that I want to
review for the channel like I just don't
really buy a lot of elf and and I know
there's a lot of hits for elf I do like
a lot of their brushes they're on pro
line of brushes are really nice too so I
would say those two things the lip
explore and the proline of brushes but i
don't really reach for a lot of that
yeah so any other anybody else that
favorite elf products talk to Jill
excuse me her name is spelled GI LOL
all right Morgan says you have a
favorite high-end drugstore makeup brand
ah i would say Kat Von Dean to the face
has really been impressing me lately
like a lot lorac the proline only the
pros stuff like the promo palettes the
rest of their lyin eyes kind of hit or
miss for me but the lorac Pro I shadow
formula is fab but as far as
consistently I would say to face think
Avon's here my favorites all right Jill
says naked one two or three i only own
the naked too so i'll say too because
that's the only one that i own and I I
mean the other ones I'm sure are
absolutely fabulous but i only own the
two and i don't really need the other
ones because they've already been
reviewed I tried to get the naked 3 when
it first came out and is sold out I was
at work and I was trying to get it and I
was trying to be I was being
irresponsible is what it comes down to
so I didn't end up yet while I was
reason why I didn't get is because I was
being responsible and I was I was not
making getting the naked 3 a priority i
was making teaching be a priority so i
did not get the naked 3 when it came out
and then by the time i was able to get
it it was uh it was already being
reviewed by everybody so i just skipped
it so i would send a naked too i love my
naked 2 I love it Brianna Decker love
your videos Jen hi from the Shaam what
are your favorite products under five
dollars under ballers I don't know this
is a thing I don't know where the cutoff
is so I'm just going to show you things
that I think are awesome that are
probably around that five dollar mark
because like I said I don't have a lot
of elf which I know of course it's going
to be under five dollars um my glamour
flage light concealer stick I really
like a lot but Jordanna best / extreme
mascara is amazing oh I've still got it
here I need to throw this away it's like
one of those things where I just need to
go buy another one I need to break down
I need to go buy another one because
this one's gold oh let's see things that
are probably under wet and wild
lipsticks what Lowell lipsticks are all
somewhat wild blushes are also
wet'n'wild the three pan pallets or the
ones that are the sixth for the six pan
or a pan these eight pants these are
really good if they're in the black
chasing I really like those a lot let's
say anything else around that five
dollar mark those are the big ones those
the ones i can think of both i think of
off the top of my head um yeah that's
what I got right now okay if I think of
anything else I'll throw that in there
oh I got a text from lily I forgot to
send you can find Julie he's neopost
candy shop collection okay good morning

let me go back down ok Caroline oh wait
that's another question from Caroline ok
all right Rachel gal from us Australian
wanting one should go to drugstore
foundation i just mentioned that a
minute ago but i'll say it again um this
one and that may believe that me matte
and poreless is my favorite but it's not
for dry skin and then the infallible i
think is more universe
I like this one better only because of
the tone but this one is a more
universally awesome foundation okay
let's say yesenia we had a chance to try
to FX cover drops no but I want to oh my
goodness chooses its life changing this
is what I've wanted foundation to be my
entire life thanks for taking us with
you two I mats it was the next best
thing absolutely uh thank you see I
really I mean now I need those cover FX
jobs because Laura okra mrs. Lola review
them and it was like oh my goodness in
you this in my life because you can put
it in your sunscreen and make your
sunscreen a foundation like you know um

find one I've heard good things about
their own about the infallible Pro matte
for people with um with drier skin uh uh
yeah I don't know I see I don't have I
don't have dry skin so it's hard for me

absolutely okay Leanne crops good
morning Jen have you tried any of the
new wet'n'wild silver lake's collection
eyeshadow palettes no I seen them all
over my subscription box and I wonder
what you think what you think on them I
you know what my my area is does not get
limited edition stuff from went well I
don't know why we don't get it so I
don't have them are I don't know I don't
know what's up with my area my
I don't live in a very um I live in a
lower income neighborhood let's just say
that so there isn't a huge market for
limited edition makeup in my area so we
don't really get it here I have to go to
win you're closer to where I work in
order to get any limited edition stuff
and I've been so busy I haven't and I
pay i have Lila with me so I feel like
drag her to the stores in order to to go
to the stores around there so um so I
haven't been able to find them but I I'm
interested in them too i would hope that
i hope that they're good that would be
awesome if they were good then you went
well for kione's I'm really curious
about especially since they only swatch
that one it looked really pretty so I'm
curious about those all right lisa says
hi happy to be doing super sex happy to
have you my daughter is one of the Sigma
f80 but is on a budget is there a true
deep or should she go ahead and buy the
real thing I will tell you I don't own a
single sigma brush don't own a single
one um because everybody and their
mother has Sigma brushes I almost want
to get some sigma brushes just for a
basis of comparison but they're so
stinging expensive and it's like are
they expensive because they're really
good or they expensive because they're
hyped up on YouTube and because people
on YouTube sell them like big people on
YouTube sell them and big people on
YouTube use them like I don't know but
my favorite brush brand is outer beauty
nobody knows about them they don't
promote God's I'm my brushes at imats
and they're amazing I don't know the f80
I'm pretty sure the f80 is a face brush
mhmmm I hope so I bet you know what I
better look it up because I don't look
like an idiot since Sigma f80 is a face
brush when it's an eyeshadow brush brush
Sigma f80 I know you see how many
tutorials i watch right all right images
yes it's like a flat top kabuki okay
that's what I thought it was okay so yes
um what I would do now that I'm looking
at this is this is my outer beauty and
it's called their flat kabuki and it
looks very similar to the pictures that
I'm looking at right now and you can see
the density there this one's dirty so
it's a little cooped up a little bit
under wash my brushes but oh my goodness
this is an amazing amazing brush I
I want to say this is only about fifteen
dollars let me look that up see I'm
looking up all this stuff outer beauty
cosmetics my outer beauty i think i just
do outer beauty yeah outer beauty
cosmetics calm and then i'm going to go
to their face brushes because i want to
know how much this brush cost and I just
can't wait face brushes okay where
sure
in dollars and this is my favorite face
rush so though honestly I would
recommend this one it's the f-102 I
think you know what f80 is face brush
I'm an idiot though see that's how I
just don't I there are certain things
that I just don't know know what I'm
saying alright but yes I would say this
one definitely from outer beauty but I
but again I don't own any Sigma brushes
so I can't like sit here and with them
next to each other and say that their
dupes but this is my favorite face brush
that looks very similar all right
Caroline Carter favorite eyeshadow
palettes I have so many favorites
girlfriend I have so many favorites um
true true favorite favorite favorite
like no joke favorite um right here this
was a holiday held by Kat Von D that
came out two years ago not last
Christmas but the Christmas before I
love this thing that one I love my lorac
pro 2 that one's amazing what else is up
here uh yeah that's pretty much it does
reply my favorites in my naked 2 and my
lorac mega Pro and of course because my
friends when we did it was on sale and I
jumped on it on amazon and I got really
SuperDuper lucky obviously there's
anything else that's pretty much it you
face pallets are awesome but I can't say
one of them is like my like favorite you
know I'm saying it's not like like the
other ones where I could be like yes
it's my favorite ok let's see Amy says
what's your go-to high-end foundation go
to high-end foundation where are you BAM
this is the hourglass immaculate in nude
I'm really like this it is a little bit
off for my skin tone it's a little too
dark for me but I'm hoping that when i
start self-tanning i just got some
saint-tropez self tanning stuff from the
birchbark shop so I'm
if that start self-tanning a bit and
hopefully this will match my skin a
little bit better but this is a
beautiful liquid to matte like it's a
liquid foundation but it really dries
down that and it's just a beautiful
foundation and i love it and again i
have normal skin so that makes you huge
difference as far as me recommending
foundations to you that this is what
works for me in my normal skin I really
love that that is definitely my go-to
I've actually also been falling back in
love with my Marc Jacobs foundation this
is the bisque light shade of the
marvelous mousse and I really falling
back in love with this I kind of took a
break from it and now I'm back using it
and I'm really really like it and I need
to use it because it's starting to get a
little older so it's got to start
getting used so back into using that I
really really like that one a lot
alright but those the foot bros hello I
did I just got the cat eye palette and I
was warning if there was a lip product
that goes with it sorry I'm late ahsoka
girlfriend um the cat eye palette is
that two-faced cat eye I think that's
too faced hey iPad it they say I think
it's too faced yep okay let me look and
see what the shades look like is there a
lipstick that goes with it I would
imagine that it would be however you
want to set your look if you're going
with those smokey colors that I'm seeing
here you probably don't want to go a
little lighter and if you're going with
the lighter shades or you can go a
little darker I don't know um I guess
that's really like a choice thing it was
a lip product that goes with it probably
not purposely going with it um but I'm
sure there's lots of lip production
could pair with it um but I don't think
there's anything that specifically goes
with it Ashley Elliott says good morning
from Chaz West Virginia just picked up
the hourglass ambient bronzer and oh my
so beautiful it's the one in radiant and
I'm bummed I can't find the wet and wild
contour palette surround me have you
tried them I haven't tried the wet and
wild contour pellets I want to check
them out definitely but I have not I
don't have a lot of the good stuff
around you like I was saying earlier my
drug stores have like the basics okay
nearly full nail polish organization oh
she's
is answering about the nail polish
organization let's sit okay elizabeth
steel that's not to say I wish let's
have to say I wear like stripper glitter
LOL i love stuff like steel a
magnificent metal eyes and Urban Decay
Glinda palette stuff like that and miss
it i miss the kiss the girl perfume as
far as products not available anymore
okay so she's answering someone else's
question okay like stripper glitter okay
all right walk all right have fun what's
up and make a bruise all right let's see
okay she wolf 214 I saw you were
speaking up in la girl Lake lip glaze
lip paint last week I own the collection
they're very intense but a little goes a
long way that is very true my last
question is how do you prevent your
manicures from smudging can't seem to
get mine to stay perfect much love from
the Caribbean okay smudging okay I have
do I have my drops where are my drops
one if I'm eye drops nothing here the
other right here okay these are amazing
these are the I got these in a new
Beauty test tube these are the dry eyes
rapid nail lacquer dryers and this is by
color club not even King I will put this
on my nails and I'm not even kidding
three minutes later my nails are
completely dry like drag it to the dry
dry dry like it's this stuff is amazing
I usually wait five minutes before I
start like banging on my nails but
mm-hmm um that's what you can by
smudging I don't know if you mean like
nail art and things because that's this
this definitely if you're if you're you
doing nail hard and it's like kind of
puffed up on your nails it does take a
bit longer but just for regular nail
polish I would say definitely I would
invest in this this stuff is fab let's
see okay blinking squares I've gotten at
l'oreal infallible Pro matte loving at
first but I weren't friday to work in
own OMG tri-city I look like I had no
moisture my skin all oh no got a judge
or skin before decide to use it day to
day she has ran dry days elantra
okay well that's good to know thank you
for saying that because me not having
that skin type I don't know so she's
saying that the Loreal infallible um
when she has dry days does not work for
her so there you go so now I don't know
for dry skin dry Koch's now I don't know
I don't know I'm sorry not usually best
that my review no no you helped my
review because now we all know that's
why we're collective brain of makeup
awesomeness here thank you alright hi
from the UK if you could only use one
makeup brand for the rest of your life
which would it be Kat Von D cat Lundy oh
my gosh got money the blushes oh the
blushes she needs come out with a blush
palette like I don't think she has she
needs come out with a blush palette Oh
amazingness amazingness any eye shadows
of course of course all right lisa says
hi from Brooklyn are you going to be
reviewing any brands again on what's up
in makeup ok my Andy person quit so
that's why I'm not is because Miami
person quit and I don't have a Sephora
regular support person anymore she
couldn't do it anymore i also don't have
a mac person right now because she is
going through some stuff and can't do
anywhere right now so right now i'm
covering sephora and mac myself and I'm
trusting everybody else to do their
stuff like I'm not sometimes I'll like
go behind and double check and make sure
things are brand new and all I don't
have time to do that because I'm too
busy doing sephora and mac so i want a
review do any brands again but oh my
good girlfriend and then the show gets
so super long we added in the sales and
deals with Nicole so that kind of took
the place at the end brands but I really
want to do the indie brands again
because I think that it's so important
to support any brands so i would like to
i would really like to it's just kind of
making it work so hopefully hopefully by
summer i will put the any brands back in
because i think it's really important is
also a lot of times the indie brands are
also cruelty-free a lot of them are
vegan a lot of them are now more natural
makeup as well so i think that's really
important for that group of people as
well who really want that kind of makeup
thank you Lisa for bringing that to my
attention um let's
de Leon says i've been using Jordanna
continuous almost almond I pencil as my
primer and it's almost gone is our
budget family eye primer you can
recommends the Milani one's really nice
I let the Milani 1 John my husband likes
Aleph one well I would say the Milani
one is probably my favorite affordable
one oh you know what that's not even
true you know what's true you show you
what's true that's what and I have I'm
do I'm going to do once I can get
through all the videos that I've have
backed up a review of all of the Coastal
Scents stuff that I bought oh my
goodness this coastal scents eye primer
is amazing amazing it comes out like um
if you don't when you first start using
it comes out a little bit oily but it
comes out it's like a little little bit
of a flesh tone and then it feels a tad
bit oily on the skin so I don't think
this would be good for oily lids but if
you have normal to you know normal lids
then one I only sing normal lives I
means people that have oily lids are
abnormal but this stuff makes my
eyeshadow stay on forever and it is very
very affordable if i remember right see
now i gotta look it up just to make sure
because i don't want to recommend
something I don't want to recommend
something and having not be right so
let's double check and make sure oh it's
ten dollars lu lu ten dollars really
Coastal Scents really ten dollars are
you kidding me it's not affordable and
knowledge I guess it's less than the
high end but ten dollars go still sense
and that's the sale price you know I
always have everything on sale on that
website but it says here don't press
this $15 I don't know about that oh but
it is a fantastic eye primer let's see
am i yeah I made it I hope you're having
a wonderful morning i hope you are too

I love them okay all right so let's see
where were we okay blinky squares my
friend got me that the three for
christmas love oh the naked 3 awesome
look says another question what do you
use for your skincare and what you
recommend more epsy or birchbox all
right so as far as skin care I am
constantly changing my skincare routine
because I am always trying out new
products that I get in all these
different boxes and things that I get so
I never stick to anything for too
terribly long um right now what am I
using right now it's all in the bathroom
should I go get it okay I'm gonna go get
my skincare stuff that i'm using right
now i'm going to run as fast as i can
and i'll be right back ah i might be
right back side haha
I ran into my can't halfway there okay
so I got all my stuff it's a good thing
I see this is one thing that's good
about having a smoke house as i can grab
all my stuff in less than a minute okay
so this is what I'm trying right now and
I'll kind of give you what's going on so
my cleanser this is the cleanser that
I've been using this is the list or old
cleanse &amp;amp; polish hot cloth cleanser I
like this I don't like it as much as
when I first started using it I feel
like it's a little weak on the eye
makeup removal especially if I don't use
the cloth as applause get dirty really
really quickly so I sometimes run out of
clothes so I am I really only recommend
this if you're going to use the cloth
because I feel like that's when it
really does what it's supposed to do but
it is nice it's a nice cleanser for eye
makeup remover I had gotten this in a
beauty box 5 you can see that it's
almost gone already this is the Marcel
gentle makeup remover for sensitive eyes
I absolutely love this stuff it's
amazing for toner i'm using the in
dealey coq10 toner and i like this i
really see my pores like open up and
like be ready for the influx of skincare
into my face when i use this it's got a
really nice scent i got this in that um
lucky box was it um i have the video on
it it was a subscription box it was like
a $75 like one time like box of stuff
like mystery stuff and i'm really
thankful that I got this because I'm
really enjoying using that so our serums
I got this in a boxy charm this is that
provides skin type 126 oil-free tonic
infused with antioxidant rich daisy
flower extract and hyaluronic acid to
help lighten
and brighten the skin and I don't know
about this yet I haven't been using it a
whole lot so far i mean it's it's a
serum i can't i can't really tell when i
use serums whether they're actually
doing anything I just cross my fingers
and hope and then from moisturizer i'm
using the purely spirit i drew balance
moisturizer and this one this is a nice
moisturizer it's a little heavy duty for
me for spring moving into summer i need
just a very lightweight moisturizer for
spring and summer and this one is a
little heavy for me but i do like it i
just have to make sure that i use less
than what I typically use when in the
winter time and then for eye cream I
really like this I cream this is the
origins and ginseng refreshing eye cream
to brighten ND puff I don't have a puppy
RI issue I do have a brightening issue
like I like my my eyes tend to be a
little on the dark circle e kind of side
but I really like this has got a really
nice smell oh no it doesn't i thought it
doesn't it's got its kind of decent snow
i was thinking of the one that i was
using before this that had a really nice
smell i don't typically smell my butt is
the one I was using right before this
had like an orange II kind of scented
smell really good but I really like this
it doesn't work does it actually like do
what it says it's going to do and I mean
I like it I probably will repurchase it
when I like it so that's my current
skincare routine that's what I'm doing
right now ok let's see d daddy hi Daisy
what's a good cream blush thank you I
got one for you Daisy I got on with user
being nice glad you know they live here
so okay this I got in a sephora sampler
kitting like the 500 play park or
whatever this is the bobby brown blushed
Rose blush um and this formula is just
amazing it looks super dark and I was
using this a lot in the winter time but
I mean it looks super dark let me see if
I can get a good swatch see how dark
that is but when you rub it in man it
just gives them best like coming in from
the cold blush just gorgeous and this is
a beautiful formula I i own a lot of
cream blushes this is definitely my
favorite formula if I
you'll the need for more cream blushes
this would be where I would reach first
definitely okay Taylor Carter is the
palette that was feature with Samantha
Riley available anywhere it's available
on the serenity and Scott website and I
haven't been the serene ian scott
website to see how it's available let me
go ahead and look hey kids you're being
very well you bring it down a notch
please thank you all right serenity and
Scott okay let me see if I can find
where um where her palate is sold so
that I can see how easily it's
accessible okay we got 15 minutes left
in chat okay well they have a beautiful
website okay let's see shop shop retail
okay hold on a minute okay I don't see
the palette hold on a second I don't see
her palate that's so weird okay I don't
see it okay um-hmm that's very odd I see
the refill pans wow they're eight
dollars apiece for their eyeshadows
whole usually I mean they are nice but
yeah i'm not i'm not sure what the deal
is with that why they don't have her
palate I mean why I even bother to
promote it if you're not going to have
it available to purchase like that you
don't have saying like I never even
thought to look on their website to see
how to get it I just assumed it would be
on the website for sale well that's lame
um because I mean what's the point that
makes me very upset I don't even see
where you can get okay I'm going to have
to email them and find out what the deal
is with that so i can put that
information that stinks that really
that's really lame
okay well I'll have to find out about
that because that that's dumb ok I'm
going to move on from that because I'm
just repeating myself over and over
again Taylor I'm sorry about that I just
assumed it was on the website all right
Lilly says good morning girlfriend I
know I'm Way behind all right newest
first we're refreshing refreshing we got
15 minutes left so if you are leaving a
comment now I probably won't get to it I
might but I probably won't let's say
newest first but because it's in the
comments section I'll be able to reply
to you later we're last week when it was
all in chat it wouldn't let me even see
what people were saying okay let's say
where's Lily Lily Lily Lily there you
are up nope not a minute okay there she
is okay yesenia i'm lusting over the Kat
Von D shade in like I Pacolet i swatched
it heaven ok so speaking of Lily Lily
was telling me about the Kat Von D shade
in like contour palette and she was like
you know what she's like you know it's
watches really well but it doesn't last
on the skin and I totally agree with her
I think I'm taking it back the contour
power the regular contra part I think
I'm gonna take it back because I used it
as an eyeshadow one day with primer just
to see like if I could double do it and
my I showed was like gone like gone by
six or seven hours after wearing and
that never happens to me even with
inexpensive I shows that never happens
any eye contour was gone in like four
hours that is just unacceptable to me
for something like this that's not okay
um but as far as the eye palette I I
have nots watched it yet and I want to
really bad but I'm not swatched it but
it looks amazing all right nestle nessa
irene we good morning good morning Nessa
all right Carol says you recommended the
torklift palette a few weeks ago for
good matte palette okay I got it I love
it oh good thanks don't really love your
channel especially what's it been makeup
in this new life format yeah I'm so glad
Carol i've swatched the toilet palette
but i don't own it but I've heard such
wonderful things about it such wonderful
things all right bozo for brows was a
good liquid eyeliner
drugstore high-end I have a few that i
really like you're gonna talk about this
this a lot but that's okay i was talking
about a bunch of times hopefully people
that better here every week don't mind
me repeating myself I have three and
honestly they're all pretty equally as
good I would say my least favorite of
these three that I would recommend is
the Maybelline master precise even
though I do love it I love it love it
love it um but it's um it just doesn't
last quite as long I don't think I have
all these black lines swatches I just
feel like it doesn't last quite as long
the point is a little easier to bend
over time which makes it a little less
effective but when it's brand new it's
amazing Maybelline master precise and it
is very accessible the next one would be
that's the least accessible but is my
actual favorite is the Jessie's Girl
liquid eyeliner you can get this at some
I always forget which one whether it's I
think it's rite aid that sells some
justice for products or Jesse scroll
online this one is amazing this one is
my actual favorite it's just the point
is amazing it's got kind of a brush
point and I love it a new discovery that
I love is the tart and multiply lash
enhancing liquid eyeliner I can't speak
to the lash enhancing part but man is
this a beautiful application just
absolutely beautiful just that beautiful
fine point it's perfect it's absolutely
perfect to God on hautelook went or it
was on her look and I am in love with
this eyeliner so those are the three
that I would recommend all right nASA
says um 42 I thought for the cover FX
drop you're probably right I maybe I
blew it up in my head but it was 60 some
dollars but for TT you're probably right
I'm sure you're right Eleanor's is high
from London you have any tips on how to
buy makeup on a budget watch a lot of
YouTube videos and to find out which
which ones are good things um really
there's there's up some staple drugstore
products that everybody talks about the
wet and wild blushes wedding I shadows
when wealth lipsticks are all really
good but the eyeshadows that are in
those three pans or the eight pans with
the black casing not the white ones um
the let's see what else is drugstore
that people absolutely love the lorry om
fell
I shadow singles are amazing the let's
say Jordana best / extreme mascara me
there's a lot of really good drugstore
mascaras the was it the the butterfly
mascara what you call it um is that
L'Oreal I can't remember I can't like
trying to think of my head the butterfly
mascara but whatever I think it's
fitting it's L'Oreal the butterfly
mascara is amazing there's been a lot of
hype about that one try to think some
other drug stores that are like crayon
like definitely but really I mean
there's there certain drugstore products
that are known to be amazing just stick
with those and don't experiment and buy
things that are you know don't try
things out you know research do your
research before you buy things oh but
you're in London so you're not gonna be
able to get a lot of that stuff youtube
videos but i don't know what's available
in London as far as your products and
I'm sure that there are products that
are well known in the UK that are easily
accessible that everybody knows are
amazing i wish i had more knowledge
about that but but definitely just do
your homework before you go I just make
sure you know it's you've done your
research before you buy it or the other
thing too is make sure you buy from
stores that you can return things open
back up that you've already tried and
then you can cut down how much you're
spending those are my suggestions all
right Nadine Nadine says hi John when
you going to go back to blogging John
has stopped his channels for a little
while because he is working his face off
at work trying to save money for us to
buy a house he is the major money maker
in the family I'm a public school
teacher so my money is like a drop in
the bucket compared to WikiLeaks as a
tattoo of a tattoo shop owner and tattoo
artist so he is just working his face
off trying to save money for us um so
that's why he hasn't been doing his
vlogging but once we once we get through
this once he'd me save enough money who
probably calm down at work a little bit
take another day or so off so he can
work more on his youtube channels but I
mess up doing is walking too because I
like watching them let's say oh ok Sarah
says of to Elinor she's talking about in
this book
beauty in the UK has some really good
makeup on a budget tips she meant to
comment to Eleanor and not needing all

sweet of you I oh that's so nice oh I
you know what's funny is i was talking
to jessica from Jan beauty 89 she gets
set like a ton of stuff like a ton of
stuff and like I don't really get stuff
sent to me because I don't know I just
kind of feel like you know you guys
should be spending your money on like
stuff for you know stuff for me you know
I'm like a it's your money you know I
mean but if I'm not gonna say don't get
me something because I think they'll be
rude you know but it's like I feel odd
you guys shouldn't be spending on

just me I thought that sounds weird if
I'm saying that you know in a good way
or not but but that's very sweet of you
i do have my address in my account

good morning yes a lot i'm at perfecting

that's good to know very nice good to
know thanks
they see this collective brain here
collective brain Caitlin fudge you're
the cutest kisses from Newfoundland
Canada all PS love your makeup news
Thank You Caitlin a list says the sigma
brushes shed and I believe you Liz Liz
I've known you long enough that I'm with
you girlfriend so maybe I shouldn't
invest in Sigma brushes Liz maybe I
shouldn't I again I don't know how to
single one of them I just don't Sigma's
never contacted me and said hey I want
to send you some brushes because I guess
I don't really do tutorials and then I
do do they like have like they're like
flops like my last tutorial like got
like such few views compare the rest of
my videos I guess just because it's not
what I typically do on my channel but
yeah so that's I think that's why I
don't get a lot of stuff sent to me that
a lot of other people get sent to that
because they do a lot of tutorials and I
don't so and also like I'm super honest
so somebody sends me something that are
running the risk of me trashing it so
that might be fun too but that's okay I
don't need any more stuff it's okay
uncle uncle as far as comfy he's not
setting me tons of brushes and entire to
face collections like I don't need it
what do I need it for I don't need it
let's say Kristin says what are your top
three youtubers to watch I love
Jacqueline hill okay I just honestly
like I just started watching a little
bit of jaclyn hill here and there and i
actually do really like her you know I'm
surprised that I like her and let me
just tell you why because she's just so
huge and usually people would they get
huge they become unrelatable for me like
I I think once somebody gets past like
200,000 subscribers like I usually
unsubscribe because I can't relate to
them anymore like I just I mean even
people that don't have that many
subscribers like once they they have
that I've gotten noticed by people on
YouTube air about them I just I don't
care anymore like I just whatever I
would much rather watch people that have
like the same number of subscribers me
or less because I just feel like I can I
can relate and I know that I'm speaking
to a real person that's not influenced
by anything other than their own
personal experiences so so my favorites
I've been watching lately I'm Cassie
from thrift thick I absolutely love
Laura from mrs. Lowell mi absolutely
love Lily Spurgeon and that girlfriend I
know you're in here Lily as is she's
starting
off a little slow like as far as her
number of video she's putting up with me
girl and I was about makeup she knows
about makeup she knows so I trust her
like 100 and a bazillion percent um
let's see who else have I been loving
lately Nicole from yay or nay with
Nicole like I just started watching her
videos she's relatively new to making
videos I believe but I just I basically
just found her channel from her working
for what's up and make up a man she's
got some good stuff going out and her
kitchen oh my gosh she just did a hello
fresh video or kitchen oh it's my dream
kitchen I love it um let's see who else
youtube you two okay let's focus focus
Jen focus favorite other favorite people
that i watch kristin from kristin game i
love I still watch some emilynoel83 here
in there but I haven't found her reviews
to be quite a spot on as they used to be
as far as my personal taste and her
personal taste so I haven't been
watching her quite as much because
sometimes I strongly disagree with the
way like she'll try something and then
I'll try the same thing and will they
completely disagree on how it worked for
us so that makes me not that she's not
telling the truth in any way I don't
mean that at all but just that maybe we
have different tastes so maybe her
reviews aren't as good for me personally
but I do still like her channel a lot
and I still do go and watch our videos
um some other ones that I've been
watching a lot lady those are the big
ones i mean there's lots i watched so
many channels oh my gosh so many
channels oh but those are some of my
favorites let's see i know thats that
you said three i gave you way more than
three nearly el Alvarez good morning
girly from Chicago good morning I and
says how much of your time goes to
youtube it is your YouTube channel
consume way too much way too much what's
up in a cup probably takes a good 10
hours or so to put together at least 10
to 12 hours just for that for the week
as far as the research i'm putting into
it and then the editing and the filming
and all of that prob about 10 to 12
hours just on that video and then a
regular video will probably take me
depending on the editing to 24 hours for
other videos but if you think about it
if this is a job for me you know working
in extra 20 hours a week I mean that's
just a normal job it's a part-time job
so that's what I'm supposed to be
viewing if it's doing it's a part-time
job you know what I'm Sam so it's okay
I'm cool with it it just it's a lot on
top of everything else in the movie but
it does take a long time but it's okay
all right Lily says crown brushes on
hautelook and they have a round kabuki
brush that's about eleven dollars room
that's interesting a crown brush has
been hit or miss with me I don't know if
if you've had what your experience has
been Lily but I've had some hit or miss
there they can kind of tell which ones
are the more higher-end brushes from
crown brush and those have been good the
ones that looked GP seem to be cheapy
for me I don't know that that wasn't a
very good expression look very good we
haven't described that all right it's
eleven o'clock so let me see if I can
get just a couple more in here Roxanne
says stopping in to say hello amazing
catch you like this when he amazing to
see you too Roxanne I'm Emily awesomest
says good morning luv good morning Lily
says good morning completely melissa
says have you tried the hourglass
mineral veil primer what do you think of
it there a lower cross one that's
similar Melissa I tried that hourglass
probe el primer and I did not think it
was anything special I really didn't I
got a sample from of it from Sephora
because I was trying to decide whether I
want to buy it and it was just like oh
it was okay it was alright let me see I
would recommend that are still really
like this one this is by this is the
vitamin C boost by body shop and its got
like a citrusy kind of scent I really
like this be like sent if you don't like
sense go bank at this one really like a
lot I think it was kind of pricey though
if i remember right at least the other
face counters that i've been using that
are similar this one's not bad um the
revitalift miracle blur but I've heard
that this sticks to dry pouches for
people with dry skin but I like that one
um we're going to go said to face
primers that I've been loving lately um
but but yeah what's not impressed with
the mineral veil mmm um Amy says
favorite lip product brands like I was
saying earlier in the very very
beginning the NYX butter glosses are my
favorite there as far as lipsticks the
two faced the la creme lipsticks are
amazing and those are definitely
favorites for high-end lipsticks for
lower-cost lipsticks I would say the wet
and wild lipsticks are awesome I also
like the Revlon bomb stains they are fab
but for high-end I would say definitely
the two-faced there there's nothing
nothing compares to you my to face look
rooms I love those they're super fab ok
so let me see if there's anything I can
do very quickly are a breezy says the
rad Beauty Blender I here at least red
dye in your hand when you apply water oh
no and put a looking front to put on
liquid foundation what's best to use
another color beauty blender any other
products like that we tried the Real
Techniques one it's dirty excuse the
dirtiness if you try this one I don't
know what your real name is but it says
crazy vibe is your username you're very
pretty if that's you um yeah this one is
awesome i love this and then the
original Beauty Blender I really like a
lot but i would say go with this one man
this thing's awesome this is the real
techniques when you get it Alta so all
right it's 1103 so I'm going to go spend
some time with my kids they've been so
but just playing on their own it's tough
