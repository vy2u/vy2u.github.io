up and make up chat I'm so excited to be
here again with you this morning to talk
with you about the glorious world of
makeup that we all love so much I've got
my elmo coffee mug hmm and yeah and I've
got my products here and chat with you
guys about things it looks like we don't
have anybody viewing quite yet in the
limit version so I'm just going to kind
of ramble for a minute while I get the
chat up so that i can see what people
are saying now in order to comment if
you are here live and you are going to
just leave a comment like you normally
do it looks like that's the way this is
working this morning one thing we had an
actual chat um but I don't know what
happens then I don't know how have
worked so let me know an i think i'm
gonna hear myself for a second okay well
good i got i caught that and let's see
okay there's no comments let yet so it
won't let me it won't let me do it okay
ah so anyway i'm very excited about i
think the most exciting thing for me
that i saw this morning on the dawn then
the news was the new mac collection the
wash and dry collection I don't know why
that packaging just calls to me just
absolutely cost me it's so pretty I know
it's just plastic with a very fancy
print on it but for some reason it's
like by me especially the highlighter
that was like the wave from like the
coral to the neutral the hell wave thing
I thought that was really cool um what
else that tony moly spray I thought that
was really neat the four wheel control
I'm really curious to see whether that's
going to help people that do have that
wheel control problem and plus that
packaging the little bunny packaging was
so stinking cute what else was really
cute let's say I'm looking at the
different things that I am look at my
script to see if there's anything else
that like really stood out to me
diorshow mascara on trees to know
whether they're going to keep their old
phone at all because it is just cold
diorshow so I'm curious to know whether
they're going to keep their old formula
or if they're just going they totally
reformulating it to have the fibers in
it and
leaving it like that like I'm curious
about that we hit refresh and see if I
can um get some comments because what
you guys start commenting then I can
start actually know what I'm going to go
someplace else oh it is that it is the
chat on the side yay ok cool yeah the
chat on the side is working cool ok so
Mary's my first comment that I see I
don't think you got my question last
week what's your favorite subscription
box each arm boxy charm boxy charm boxy
charm I wasn't the biggest fan of the
two that just went up on the on the
channel when I had those two but the
april one was pretty good I'm pretty hot
by the everyone know anything is the
april one came with the biggest thing
and it was something that I already had
so I'm gonna have to pass that along but
you know it's okay most people don't
have it so I can't like take it from
that point of view it was a really good
boxing in April so that's going to be
coming up soon I have a backlog of
videos that I've already filmed so I got
to get through those she says choice
choice not cold Chewie I forgot how to
pronounce it now shwa choise how it's
pronounced this your new favorite yay
I'm glad you like that subscription
Nader by the full full-size Kevin a quad
flip Rose blood rose lipstick and lip
gloss that toy was nice enough to
actually enjoy Japan showing schwa

video it wasn't part of the deal I
didn't know they were gonna send me
anything and I was like oh I love you I
love this lip gloss I love it i'm
totally with you love the colors no I
fail putting lipstick so on you know I
do too and especially with darker colors
because I used to wear so many neutrals
I didn't realize like because you don't
you take a neutral you know and you just
kind of you know you roll it up and you
pop it on it doesn't matter if you go
outside the line a tiny bit you know
nobody's gonna notice man when you put
on a red and you mess up it's like get
about it like everybody knows you know

Sarah says good morning Samantha says I

this month has anyone gotten to me box

mailbox their boxes typically come after
the 15th like they're they come later
they're one of the later boxes so we
won't get it until the very earliest
like after the tenth more scada good
morning Bradley says hey Jen hey Bradley

morning just watch your what's up and
make up I hope you enjoyed it Christine
says yes that was April Grady says that
was April living like Julie good morning
Samantha says I'm very excited to start
the box trap subscription I also thought
about new Beauty test to be getting
mixed reviews don't do it don't do it
don't do it um they have been messing
with my credit card lately as far as
overcharging me and they're not
responding to me they're making me mad
and the tubes are not great um at all
they you should be really good about a
year ago with the last time we got a
really good one so if don't do it I
would say look at look at videos from
popsugar restaurant instead that one's
in the same same kind of range for price
I would say look at that I would say
look at wanna bowl you don't get a lot
of products but you get higher-end
products and full-size products i would
say look at those before new beauty test
tube let's see sherry says i miss that
Birchbox and try boxy charm yeah I mean
and you can always look especially if
you don't have you spend all your brush
box points if you have them you know
cancel birchbox too boxy charm for a
month or two and then go back to
Birchbox it's one of those things where
you know you can flip back and forth
there's no shame in that steph says the
wash and dry packaging reminds me of the
Proenza Schouler ones I don't know that
one I don't know that one I wish I did
off to look that up Samantha says I also
get FC but I'm considering canceling
yeah if she's condom it's kind of hit or
miss they have a lot of kind of off
brands with some off quality sometimes
in hep-c Christine does enjoy epsy as
much either Grady sense she liked their
you guys just have a conversation about
boxes so I'm just going to kind of skim
my eyes boxy charms always worth the
money I think so too even when I don't
really like the box I feel like it's
worth the money I agree with you Grady
I'm just reading them because they're
just kind of responding back and forth
good morning to candy Christine says for
boxy charm now you get 10 for item every
month is in your box I know but I like
ofra i do i was called them off row but
i think it's over nicole says good
morning you made
yeah Nicole is our special events and
deals reporter hi good to see you Nicole
let's see yeah I didn't get the stretch
highlighter from ofra Samantha in my in
my box each arm I got the really big
like a shimmery pink glitter mom it's
not even a highlighter to me it's like
straight glitter and it's huge hmm
sherry says you have favorite skincare
I'm looking for something new I'm always
trying new stuff girlfriend always try
new stuff right now I had my skincare
stuff here from last week and then I put
it away to use it and now I feel like
I've to go back and get it um Oh what's
a call all right I got to go back and
get it I gotta go get it so I'm gonna go
get all my skincare stuff that I have
them using right now and I'll right back
she'd give me like 30 seconds and sure
to run to the bathroom okay wanna right
okay all right I wouldn't got everything
done so i can show you there's a couple
things i didn't show you last week i'm
going to show you today that we're in
the shower i'm just going to show you
what i'm using right now for skincare so
for eye makeup remover i got this in a
beauty box 5 this is the marcel gentle
makeup remover for sensitive eyes it can
feel a little bit oily at sony comment
last week that it's a little bit it
can't feel a little bit wheelie but I
just wash it off and then I'm fine or
I'll use the cleanse or afterward and it
totally gets rid of any oily mess on my
skin but this works really really well i
love this again that's by mar 7 and then
for cleansers this one I was in love
with this is the Liz oral cleansing
polish hot cloth cleanser if you don't
use the cloth it doesn't work as well
and my calls get dirty really fast so
I'm not digging on this as much as I
once was this is my new favorite right
now along with the sookie exfoliating
cleanser but I'm not I haven't been
using that lately because i've been
using a different exfoliator i'll show
you in a minute but this is the key west
alo gentle alo facial cleanser this
stuff is amazing takes my eye makeup off
and everything and it smells like lemons
it's fabulous and then this is the
exfoliator i've been using this is the
laura mercier flawless face polish and
it comes out this beautiful of peach
shade and it's just it just makes me
feel fancy for some reason and i really
like this has got kind of a medium grit
to it medium to find grit to it i really
like that a lot and then fortuner i've
been using the ending lee toner I don't
know if there's anything magical about
this but it works it's nice and then a
couple things and then we have four
tonic this is what I'm sonic it's a
serum whoo okay it's a serum this is a
I skin type 126 I got this in a boxy
charm and it makes my face feel kind of
sticky but I'm kind of fighting my way
through it i think i'm going to keep
using it i don't know it just makes my
face feel sticky so i'm not a big fan of
that one moisturizer right now i'm using
the pur Lisse pure Malloy's Hydra
balance moisturizer for normal to dry
skin I just have to use this in
moderation because if i use it full
force it is way way too moisturizing
from you i would imagine this would be
good for normal dress that i have normal
to oily skin so well normal really but
if I ever have a problem it's oily it's
not dry so um but it's okay it's nice
and then for eye cream I really like
this a lot this is the origins gents Jen
zing G ing ing eye cream is it is it
magical just do anything magical I don't
think so but I like it it's an eye cream
it's fine so that's what i'm currently
using and what I'm liking you're not
liking out of what I'm using let's say
so that hopefully that answered your
question let me go back up and see if i
can find where i left off and there's
candy saying good morning glory may it
you woke up flory I'm excited flurries
here yeah how did i miss you i miss that
you're here yay Florrie let's say go the
gold digger says good morning good
morning the air name with Nicole I know
but I was not thrilled okay she's just
responding um Nicole want to know if the
video stalled out for anyone if it was
just her there is one point where it
blanks out in sound I can't I cannot
tell you also it blanks out and sound
and that was actually an editing issue
not editing but it was a video recording
issue that my video camera actually
blanked out the sound at one point for
like a split second sound off that's
what you're talking about Nicole or if
you're talking about something else but
that was uh that was me I just tried to
leave it in there so that people
wouldn't notice because it wouldn't make
sense if I didn't leave it in there um
let's say Megan Jenna me tried the L
skincare line I haven't I would really
like to though I try not to do skin care
for review because I feel like it takes
forever to see any kind
results so I don't really buy a lot of
skin care for review but I did um I did
consider getting that but I didn't maybe
one day who one day let's see i am
reading everything i'm just not going to
read everything out loud o Grady said
she got the Oprah highlighter that was
striped and she liked it I didn't get
that one we should God no one Samantha
says it says live but it's just a black
screen try refreshing Samantha Oh
Christine said the same thing try
refreshing Oh Helen a trouser dazzle
says Helen yes that's what it was I
totally remember um let's see okay so
Samantha's here now okay no no minute
let's say okay beauty haul for mon one
Jenna wanted to let you know that the
colour-pop brand is an amazing brand you
really should give them a try the
products are very affordable and unlike
any other brand i know i should i know i
should but it you know this is i think
i've said this before as far as color
pop you know everybody reviews
colour-pop do i need more makeup no I
don't need any more makeup so really i'm
only buying makeup to review on the
channel and if everybody reviewing color
pop pop and everybody says it's amazing
then why even bothered by it you know
like I don't know is that make logical
sense I don't know I guess if people
want me to want to hear me say that it's
amazing along with everybody else but
this is think Kristin game who's a good
friend of mine that I trust one hundred
percent over some some of the eyeshadows
that she didn't really like so I don't
know maybe I should get the ones she
didn't like to see if there I don't like
them either that's the only sorry I keep
touching my eyes my eyes are dry um but
yeah I don't know I don't know I really
should you're right i'm with you you're
right ali says good morning welcome Ali
it's good to see you again Alicia good
morning again elysium loving or what
swim yay I'm glad you love what's up in
makeup in my personality thank you that
means a lot to me I had a lot of people
unsubscribe after that um the video i
did about Baltimore who I allowed to
blonde subscribe but that's okay then if
they don't like it they if people don't
like that side of me like that's not
obviously not what I'm going to be doing
time is videos like that so like I might
throw an indication that's the first
video ever made like that on this
channel so if people didn't like that
video and they obviously didn't like the
rest of my content enough to stay and
that's fine like I don't want people
subscribe if they're not if they don't
like it if they don't like me if they
don't like you know my content then
people should not say subscribe I would
rather have an accurate subscriber count
on people that actually enjoy my videos
so that's just me personally I'd rather
have a lower number and have it be
accurate that's just me alright let's
see Samantha Richmond no newbie detested
for me yes now don't do it Florrie says
she likes my coffee look thank you I
there's a there's a Sesame Street land
or something we went there like two year
two summers ago it was weird but I got a
mug Riley says I seriously look forward
to these live streams so much I look
forward to having you here Bradley you
had some great questions last week I
always learned so much and ends up
adding so many products to list of
things I need to buy so thanks for the
great reviews no problem Bradley it's
good to have you here beauty haul 411
the lip pencils the lipstick so she's
talking about the color pop that things
are cheap yeah I know I know I know I
should I should 11 month well I did
really good in April not buying a ton of
stuff so in a maybe that'll be a thing
they get some color pop stuff nicole
says don't get the test tube I agree I
agree the litaker says drop me BB test
you about for the last two but it's not
happy i know it's not good it's not good
and even in the videos when I review it
I say it's not good maybe that's why
they keep charging maybe because I want
me to stop reviewing it those videos get
so many of you as compared my other
subscription boxes I don't want to stop
reviewing it because he a lot of use
people seem to enjoy it so you know
maybe because every time I'm like a
hottest stocks is terrible hahaha that's
why people watch them really no I'm
gonna be like oh it's terrible alright
um Steph zilla the map for a pro Oh map
for pro random ones to clarify that was
before I started looking at mac stuff
for what's at the makeup so I'm not
familiar because
I never kept up before what's been
makeup I never kept up with mac stuff so
I didn't know that but I will have to
look that up after the video is over oh
the other thing that I learned about
this chat thing even though it's cool I
can't see any comments that go into the
chat after the video is done so like
anybody that puts anything in that I
don't read before I close the chat
excuse me reckless chat I never get to
read which totally upset me that I could
not read them because I wanted to see
what I miss that I didn't get to okay
let's see um you know named cole says
fat that fun is a good too but not all
beauty I'll study something call they
sent me one for review so this is coming
up um it's going to be like a little bit
more of a sponsor d kind of video which
kind of like but I'm gonna I'm going to
do it right though I'm going to do a
genuine because they wanted me to
promote their water bottle that you put
to the fruit infuser water bottle and I
love I have one already and I love my
fruit infuser water while I've put it up
on Instagram the one that i have and i
get so many compliments on a network
like people are like oh my gosh is there
fruit floating in your water like people
like freaked out over this water bottle
so I felt comfortable like talking about
it and showing like recipes and things
for with it and then they sent me the
Springboks to go along with it to just
show you what's inside so it might sound
a little more sponsor ii but i'm going
to try really really hard not to make it
like the things I've seen lately on
YouTube channels that drive me bonkers
like I'm just going to you know list
these talking points and i'm gonna i'm
going to say you know all of these
things because i want you to be more
informed no it's not because you want me
to be more informed it's because the
company told you to say all of these
things you know just just say the
company told you to say all those things
don't tell you don't lie don't say it's
because you want people to be informed
it just makes me angry when people don't
say in the video that they got that
stuff for promotion and that the company
told them to say things like sleep yeah
where people here were people here this
is not a commercial like drives me
insane so I'm going to try to do that
bad fit fun box right is
point and I'm going to move on now
because I think I've said enough about
that Ricky Christine Hanson do you know
of any boxes outside the US I don't keep
up with boxes outside the US I know
Birchbox just started to ship some
international boxes um you're gonna have
to look up google google but look on
youtube for your area you know you know
subscription boxes in and then put your
country and see what pops up I'm so
sorry I don't keep up with that I can't
keep up with everything I wish I could
Samantha Richmond epsy obsessed me
because even though there's a quiz and
every debt was like oh ok Emily since I
should be doing my project but this is
on huh I am girlfriend I have been there
I have been there so many times and with
you let's say I am reading everything
I'm just I mean if it's just commentary
I'm just not going to read it out loud
Jenny ride wondering if you or anyone
else has ever tried the D or D ' or
skincare that is on hautelook right now
I haven't the original prices are
ridiculous like thousands of dollars but
they're really produced I've never tried
it but you got to keep in mind that some
brands will up their price and then they
never sell them at that price it's just
to make it look fancier but no I don't
know anything about if anybody else does
anything about the door skin care that's
on hautelook please talk to Jenny Ryan
and let her know but I don't I don't
have any knowledge of it just the whole
door like it's almost like Dior the
little copy thing that bothers me so I
probably finding from them just because
of that uh Julia says hey Jen I was
wondering what your favorites from Mac
or I'm going today is my first time
girlfriend I don't own a lot of mac I I
don't so III I don't know a lot of mac
and what I do have I wouldn't strongly
recommend pretty much anything oh my
terrible
let's see there's one this this lipstick
is my favorite lipstick from that but I
own three mac lipsticks this is called
naked Paris and it's definitely not a
spring shade I don't know if you can
even see that but it's like a more of a
fall/winter shade but I really like that
one a lot it's very moisturizing I
really like the luster finishes a lot
love the luster finishes I have them you
know a couple of things I think I got a
couple things from the Cinderella
collection but I don't know any mac
eyeshadows I don't own any mac blushes
so I'm the wrong person to ask I wish my
friend war from mrs. Llewellyn was here
because she would be able to give you a
ton of great suggestions but it's just a
in my bag is you say my bag so I'm so
rude I hope you have fun though and I
hope they're nice to you that's my wish
for you Julia all right jessica says
good morning finally got got up in time
to test a yay Jessica alright leash on
hi have you tried any Korean makeup
attitude house um I want to try a tude
house I've heard wonderful wonderful
things I'll show you I've shown us a
couple weeks on the on the chat but this
is my favorite Korean product that i've
ever used this is called a makeup helper
and this I don't know who it's by
because it's all in Korea but this is
the best face powder I've ever used in
my entire life it is thinking amazing
April I can't see that but it's so
incredibly finely milled it's about $22
you can't find these online they're
either we had to search for them but you
can find these online and you can pick
out the style of the packaging and then
you can pick out the shade ranges but
this is fabulous and then I've been
digging on did I bury it where did I put
it okay oh is it back in the box this I
think this I'm pretty sure this is
Korean I'm pretty sure is this Korean
who I don't want to say no it's not
Korean nevermind it just looks great but
it's not okay so that's not going to
work um but most of the stuff that I've
tried its Korean I've gotten a meanie
boxes and now Mimi box has changed quite
a bit i haven't gotten any Mimi boxes
since then but but yeah every a lot of
stuff that tried the Korean makeup is
fantastic so there's the only things
that I want to try candy Ferguson
starlooks is good some months plus they
give you points for your birthday and
every three months you can get deep this
discount on website orders yeah
ever good things about star looks good
things and I have a couple things I have
a couple eyeliner pencils and some lip
glosses and things like that and they're
nice there's nothing like wow span
spectacular about them they don't stand
out to me but they're nice katie says I
love what's up i make it so much yay
thanks for finding an awesome way to let
me know what's new see you when i start
my channel yes please tell me when you
start your channel let me know Samantha
Richmond uh let's see she saw about
Korean Korean makeup you should try to
get some for review I should the only
thing about Korean makeup is that some
of its more accessible than other some
things are more accessible than other
things so I don't want to I don't want
to review things on the channel that
aren't easily accessible to people that
are watching so that's my only thing
about that so I'll have to find some
things that are like the more popular
like the more easily accessible stuff
and then review that okay my Indonesian
friends um Nagiko i'm gonna say
goodnight here from indonesia it's like
the end of the day tomorrow in indonesia

they say okay we're going to make a crab
are eyeshadow product so let's put it in
the white pan and we're gonna make a
good eye shadow products let's put it in
the black pants everybody knows the
difference so at least they let us know
ahead of time by putting it in the white
band we shouldn't buy it so weird so
weird an ad says good morning one of my
oldest friends on YouTube meaning the
longest time friends on YouTube good
morning and net let's see Helen says
love your mug Jim thank you what's your
favorite high end makeup brand right now
I would say Kat Von D and two feasts are
my favorites right now they've been the
most consistent even though I'm not the
biggest fan of the contour palette the
contour palette not the biggest fan the
lasting power kind of sucks so I'm
debating where they're going to send it
back or not but you know if I like the
way it goes on it just doesn't stay yea
or nay would Nicole let's see okay she's
commenting Sally says good morning good
to see you too Emily says what are good
non flaky mascaras I don't have a big
problem with mascaras flaking on me I
don't know like when i get mascaras i
it's it's rare that I get one that
flakes usually a lot of the drugstore
ones will flake and I hate to say that
what is true allow the drugstore ones
will flake on me someone's from the
drugstore that I like that do not flake
on me are the Geordie Annabeth last
extreme the Maybelline lash sensational
I love this one this one reminds me a
lot of my high and mascaras as far as
more expensive ones being let's see I
kind of like the roller lash that's
pretty good that's pretty good it's not
my fav of all time but it's pretty good
anything else in here that stands out to
me right now mascaras mascaras those are
kind of ones i'm using right now and
well i'm not really using the Jordana
one I really should throw that one way
that one's just old I need to get a new
one of that oh but yeah I would say
those are kind of a ones that I'm
digging on right now that don't flake on
me sherry says yeah we use the same face
polish I no girlfriend I know let's see
okay Samantha says just ordered the tort
mother's day kid yeah all of that stuff
$54 I know it's a really good deal if
you are wanting to get some of the heart
stuff that's pretty awesome and and I
don't think they sell it anymore i went
on that was the one where you got to
choose the stuff in the bag when i went
on there then it was all sold out so i
didn't put it in the news because it was
all sold out let's see Ali says she's
been using the shiseido cleansing oil
and white lucent cleanser to wash your
face it's amazing that's good to know
I've heard so many good things about
about shiseido skincare that's so
exciting yodeling
picked up the tart and power flower
palin the ib sale find the quality of
the shadows is just awful oh ok I have
it ma'am see you know addiction
addiction all right um you know what's
funny is i am not having a problem with
the shadows that I views I haven't used
it too many times I haven't used this
one and I've barely used this one and
I've barely used this one but I'm
finding that I don't like the blushes
the blushes are not fantastic and why
are they putting these fall looking
colors in a spring palette like what
what are you thinking on that uh you
know I am going to keep it I actually
really like the shadows and this I don't
know why you're not liking them and I'm
like no but I felt like they were pretty
good I I thought they were easy pretty
easy to use I was pretty happy with them
but I don't like the blushes in it so
it's funny how we can have such
different opinions on the exact same
thing this is the empower flower one I
think pretty sure there's no name on
this so i always forget but yes yeah
alright people responding to each other
ok back back one g morning Jen love your
channel any suggestions for a good
concealer I'm new to using concealers
and never had to before these awful dark
circles came around all right on her
look right now the bow fifty percent
until Tuesday where are you my favorite
concealer sometimes I'm gonna rush some
things end up in the wrong drawer what
am I to my counselor where did you go
sometimes ends up up here and it did in
my primer drawer ok ty bomb by the bone
this is my favorite concealer it's
amazing uh and I it's my favorite
concealer I haven't I have nothing else
to say other than it's my favorite
concealer and it's on hautelook right
now for fifty percent off so highly
recommend this and if you want to get me
twenty dollars to it look you can use my
referral link that i like to under
the video on the what's up and makeup
chat I do have a referral code for
hautelook that you can feel free to
click on and give me 20 bucks or you can
just go to vote lucam whatever makes you
happy but I figured I'd throw that in
there because when i get twenty dollars
that's always a happy day and it just
you know with you like the first
purchase like a twenty bucks so you know
I'm not trying to be greedy I'm just
letting people know you know if it you
know if you want to use it I want it to
be there for you in case you want to use
it but if not I'm not I'm not gonna it's
okay I know does that sound Balan how
much what people be aware that it's
there if they want it wait he's got a
whole look calm but yes that's my
absolute favorite concealer if you don't
want to do that um then I would say this
one is a nice one this is the glamour
flage light by hard candy this is a good
one and then the knicks concealer is
kind of oily so if you have oily skin or
if you're worried about creasing this
probably isn't going to be for you I
also like the instant age rewind by
Maybelline this is a nice one this is
the odd the dark circle one really like
that one a lot so those are those our
favorite concealers right now okay let's
see oh no let's see amber says good
morning i ordered a few of the bomb
products i can't wait to get them yay i
have a couple sample products that I've
enjoyed what the bomb products would you
say everyone using their collection okay
so that's 1 i'm also let's see what are
all my gosh so many good things so many
good things there i shadow palettes are
amazing and they're consistently amazing
so i would say with the eyeshadow
palettes pick the one that calls to you
the most and you'll like it is what my
thought would be because I've never had
a bomb eyeshadow not work for me ever
ever like they're so consistent in
Formula really consistent so I shadows
are amazing these winged eyeliner is a
little difficult to get used to it's
more of a liquidy formula it's like a
ago me show you this if it's here it's
looking funny but the swing by later is
kind of fun to play with the mascaras
the bodybuilder mascara is really nice
um where is it I know it's here
somewhere
and I'm I
clinkety-clinkety-clankety-bang- so if
you want an easy to apply liquid
eyeliner that's like truly liquid this
is a really nice one so those are kind
of my favorite products by the bone but
so much good stuff let me say there's
anything else on there the lipsticks are
kind of AD and nail polish is actually a
really nice i love the nail polishes
they're like one code nail polishes the
ones that I've gotten from them let me
see anything else stands out and you
just look real quick I'm going to pull
it up don't get the apples to apples
blushes those I did not like it all on
some people may like them so maybe you
might want to try them but I personally
do not like them the cindy cindy lou
manizer i'm not the biggest fan of but
the mary-lou manizer is very famous for
being amazing the blushes are all
amazing I've never gotten a blush from
them that I didn't like both in stained
ones and the regular formula are all
some let's see I haven't tried the new
eyeliners if you just tuning in I'm
talking about the bomb on hautelook
right now the eyeshadow primer is ok
it's not fantastic i've never tried
their loose shadows mascara I the only
one I've ever tried as a bodybuilder and
I really like that one the brow is
product is actually really good like I
said the insane blushes are good the
tinted moisturizer is also very nice the
foundation is pretty good it does crease
if you have fine lines it does crease in
your fine lines though it's got to be
careful of that you can see little if i
said i love the face primer is pretty
good it's nice i tried the strawberry
nourishing facial serum and it's fine
does only do anything it doesn't you
know maybe it's a syrah me stuff that
I'm not aware of and let's say dry
shampoo is terrible I don't think that
that's on here the brushes are actually
very nice and that's it so that is
recommendations from the bone I have a
full video on all of my at the bone
collection so you can check that out as
well and I spent a lot of time on that
so I'm going to try to go quickly
through other things it's 1035 so we're
halfway done
ah Grady says I wish there was an easy
way to see specific questions I know
it's okay sir I don't mind Christine
says is paying one hundred sixty dollars
for custom Mac palette worth it in your
opinion I have no idea I don't know what
any any mac eyeshadows except for these
these are the only mac eyeshadows I own
and I'm not crazy about these thief
there okay alright but I wouldn't go out
of my way to buy these but they're nice
ah but no I don't know because I don't
have enough experience to give an
educated opinion one hundred and sixty
dollars a lot though girlfriend that's a
lot oh let's see I'm just reading
through ok yodel and say she love my
ball to her video thank you a lot of
people did not like it but I'm glad you
liked it you liked it and that's that's
what matters right um let's see Cecilio

associated with them so i have no idea
um Amy dimitra's how are things good
things you're good I haven't been
sleeping a lot lately I've been very
very busy my jolly job my kids are
reading novels right now my students I'm
there working through I've three
different novels that they're in and
then now I had a
that group that is not going to be with
me for the next three weeks left to plan
for them too so I've got four distinct
groups rolling every day that I have to
plan for so it's a lot of work it's a
lot of works that's been keeping me up
late along with editing I'm so behind on
editing I have a use inbox for Mother's
Day that's supposed to be up and I don't
have it up yet to be fair they didn't
tell me it was coming but still I've had
a month or so to get this video up I
filmed it I just need to edit it so I
just I feel very overwhelmed doesn't
matter i'm good by then i'm going to
handle it I'm handle limit we want to go
look at a bunch of houses today we're
trying to move our house is too small
trying to go get out of this place
because it's just we've outgrown it so
we're going to look for it look at six
houses today so really excited about
that the first house is at twelve-thirty
so super excited so I'm good thanks for
asking Amy how are you can't really do
you have any suggestions for good
eyeliner for beginners yes I do
girlfriend I got a couple for you
alright it depends on how much you want
to spend I'll give you a couple of
options okay one that's good for it the
100 a few of them because I let all of
these all right more on that get them
all out okay for baby for okay so one is
the Maybelline master precise i
recommend for beginners a pen liner
absolutely no doubt about it where
people mess up with is they get those
pencil liners and they're smudgy they
don't go on straight they're difficult
to use especially for that upper
lashline lower lashline pencil
absolutely but upper lashline go for a
pen have you got you with the perfect
amount of product on there like I
wouldn't that's what i recommend so for
pan liners that i love the Maybelline
master precise this one doesn't have a
very long lasting power though as far as
it dries out and also the tip will best
are bending and it won't be as usable so
I do really like this while it is alive
but it only laughs I would say about two
months or so before it starts kind of
losing its pizzazz you know what I'm Sam
one that's less accessible that is my
favorite is the Jessie's Girl liquid
eyeliner I've talked I talk about this
all the time so I apologize if you hear
me talk about this every week but she
asked so Jesse's hold liquid eyeliner is
my favorite but really difficult to find
they do so Jessie school products get a
lot of rite aids but they don't
necessarily carry the eyeliner but
that's another one another one that I
really like that I've never talked about
is the Physicians Formula eyeliner this
is the I boost or two and one last
bushing blast booth lash boosting two
and one lash boosting eyeliner and serum
this is the brown one I got this on a
trade on Ed and I really really like
this a lot this one is more of a bendy
kind of brush so it's a little bit
harder than the other ones you just have
to really get it in that one strokes
this with a little bit more difficult to
work with but I do really like it I want
to get this in the black eventually but
I like this one if you can't find the
other ones i recommend the maybelline
over that one though and then this one
if you want high-end the tart multiply
is fantastic i just got this off of
hautelook and this one is amazing i
would say that this one's just as good
as the Jessie's Girl one but it is a lot
more expensive so that would be my
recommendation for high end though but
yes go for a pen liner girlfriend miss
Kimberly jessica says if anyone has was
has watched your videos for any amount
of time they should not be surprised by
your Baltimore video oh thank you you're
always up front and honest keeping
yourself thank you I think people saw
that I was kind of whining about it you
know that you know my life is so hard
you know there's riots in Baltimore and
you know oh it's so bad here and I
wasn't trying to come off like that
because i know that around the world
things are so much worse than then we
have it in baltimore it's just it's kind
of shocking when it's happening in your
own backyard and it's never like for the
time that I've lived here nothing like
this has ever happened before so like
thinking about my friends going home
into that kind of situation is very
scary for me so it's just not something
that I'm used to I wasn't trying to
complain like that my life was terrible
or that things were extra bad for me or
anything like that I was trying to say
that i was just kind of expressing my
feelings on the whole thing oh and by
the way the cops are being charged with
manslaughter all six of them are being
charged with manslaughter by the way
which the city i think is now going to
call now because we know that there's
one going to be justice but this is the
thing if there weren't riots what these
cops be charged i don't i don't know so
it's just it's such a sticky sticky
sticky sticky tub subject so the topic
subject that was subject is what happens
when you mix the subject in the topic so
but but yeah I mean you know it is what
it is I debated back and forth about
putting up that video i like to the last
minute of whether i was going to put it
up or not I'm glad I did let's see uh
Nicole's responding and that's
responding Diane Diane hi Deann good
morning not sure if you already went
over this but I'm curious about the
cover effects custom car drops are any
good so many mixed reviews I know
they're expensive but any chance we'll
try I really really want to try it
really bad I was actually talking to
lily I was texting back and forth with
Lily was editing last night and she does
not like them well she says they're kind
of hit or miss she likes the effect but
she says that they never quite second
pletely see your skin always feels a
little bit tacky I haven't heard that
from anybody except for Lily but I trust
lily a hundred percent so I'm curious
like maybe certain formulas will be more
tacky than others like she said after
with foundation she said she mixed it
with but but yeah I've heard a lot of
good things and I think that that's
really really interesting what I would
love to put you know some custom cover
drops in this like and see what happens
I have some sunscreen that I love the
way it feels I got it in meanie box
micronian friends and got this in a
meanie box and this is the high
protection Moringa light sunblock and
it's by seven drops and this stuff looks
amazing I haven't used it yet but it
feels like it feels fabulous it's like
got this really nice smooth texture and
just it's got a nice smell to it and
it's just off I would love to put some
custom cover drops in this and see how
that goes it's got a little bit of a
sunscreen kind of smell but I would love
to put them in this and see what happens
but I think that will be my next
purchase I really do because I don't
think i'm going to not be able to try it
I have to I have to try it I have to and
if I've to take it back i have to take
it back it is what it is um Laura says
they work for her oh she can't get her
car Oh Laura says I can't get my cover
effects drops to work for me she's going
to return them
oh that's good to know all right we got
15 minutes left so if you haven't if you
just putting in a comment for me now I
probably won't get to it i'm sold sorry
i do have to get ready at eleven o'clock
because my family is coming back we have
to leave here by 11 30 so i have to be
completely ready to go by eleven-thirty
so all right madam Bugsy do you have any
insiders that know about color pops no
nope I don't know anybody I don't I'm i
don't i'm not in the colour-pop circle
with kathleen and danny i'm not in that
circle and outside the circle way
outside the circle so I don't know okay
uh nicole says she loves fat that fun so
cool then I got in free I know I
couldn't believe it i was so excited I
wasn't trying to brag by the way I hope
that you guys didn't think I was trying
to brag about the fact that fun box I'm
not trying to I'm trying to share stuff
with my friends like I consider you guys
my friends I'm just sharing with you and
showing you that it's coming on the
channel I hope you don't think that I
was bragging about it because i'm not
i'm not trying to be like that that's so
not me um some fish outta water question
about the mary-lou manizer okay that's
by the bomb it's the highlighter that's
very very famous for you i'm already
huge fan huge bomb fan and owned many of
the products thanks you too but look
wondering if there is difference between
the highlight in the bon jovi parent and
the actual mary-lou manizer i can tell
you where's the bon jovi pellet i have
it let's tear out to get a girlfriend
okay so here's the bon jovi fam and this
is called disco disco is a highlighter
i'm pretty sure it's more gold and then
let's get into the mornin Evelyn or and
then here's Mary Lou yes there is a
difference Mary Lou is more champagne
and the one in here is a little bit more
gold it's not a huge difference you see
if I can if you'll be able to see I
don't know if you'll be able to see it's
definitely a very subtle difference but
this one definitely has more of a pinky
tone where this one has more of a peachy
tone this is the mary-lou manizer is the
more a little bit more pinky champagne e
and then the disco disco in the bomb
jovi is a little bit more peach toned so
the showing on it looks about the same
it looks like yeah they're definitely
different this one has more the bomb the
bon jovi one the disco disco has a
little bit more goldish kind of flex in
it where this one has more of like
silver rose gold as kind of flecks in it
kind it's so finely milled it's really
hard to see but there's definitely a
difference are you gonna be able to tell
the difference in the cheeks prolly not
but in the swatch I can tell so there
you go yeah we got to figure that out
together it says it's one of the same
but note it's not the same it's
definitely not the same there's no way
that's the same it's not the same
they're crazy you know what honestly you
said you said you're a bit more yellow
so I honestly like I whip to the peach
one over the champagne one I will go for
this one so don't you think the peach
would look better on a yellow skin tone
than the pink I think so that's my
opinion hmm let's see inet saying what's
wrong with the cover of eggs rob's yeah
I've heard i've heard mixed reviews I've
heard that sometimes it's difficult to
work with I've heard like um you know
about the stickiness from Lily hoping
just get random highlighter on my face
L'Oreal telescopic from yonni with
Nicole dozens of flake is what she says
that's cool hi Amy Amy says hi Bradley
says in the UK GlossyBox is probably one
of his favorites so if you're looking

AKA Leanne let's see Bradley says not a
fan of Mac benefit urban decay in the
bomb or his favorites let's see Kimberly
said side the brow Wiz from anastacio do
i also need the pomade you know what
i've heard about the brow Wiz is that it
runs out really really fast there is a
very tiny bit of product in there I
would say if you like your brows dark I
would say get the Paul main if you like
them to be like really pigmented like my
brows in the west of the makeup show
that just went live I was using the
pomade and you can see like I taped it
on because with my black hair if I don't
put on like thicker browse like more
dense Browns I feel like it looks weird
with my darker hair so I've been using
it a lot if you like a more natural brow
I would say don't get the pomade it's
not it's not worth it if you like your
brow is Madame Bugsy you can all buy
color pop and i canna doms over let's
see alyssa marie hey Jim what do you
recommend from benefit I had this
question last week too I don't like a
lot of benefit stuff to be completely
honest I there's not a lot
stuff that I really love like right now
I have the roller lash but it's just
okay I have one of the cream eyeshadows
it's just okay look at Mike scores the
primers are rice the benefit primers are
going oh let's see the state's long I'm
honestly not a huge benefit fair like as
far as things but they just don't blow
me away like a lot of tort stuff doesn't
blew me away some start stuff does but
not a lot so yeah I don't have a lot of
suggestions for benefit that's probably
the one that my own the least amount of
stuff from um yeah I wish I could tell
you more about that you know the primers
I guess we'll probably be the best stuff
that I own from benefit yeah yeah
probably if anyone else has any benefit
suggestions talk to UM Alyssa let's see
what is your strangest beauty product
from Megan strangers beauty products
strangest strangest beauty product do I
have beauty products that are strange
I'm sure I do this is a weird one and
then you'll ever showed you guys this
one this is the tight line waterproof
full lash mascara by eight cosmetics
oops I always open it upside down this
is weird look at that it's very weird
and it dried out on me I don't know why
I keep it I guess because I never talked
about it so I figured one day I will
talk about it it worked pretty nicely
when it was when it was working when it
wasn't dried out it really lengthen the
lashes gave no volume and that tight
line thing was really weird I feel like
I was gonna put my eye out this is a
weird product we're gonna go with this
one this one's very weird I mean look at
that but weird eerie we're near weird
all right what a great question they
again I love that question oh it's
saying good drugstore Honor I setting
powders I don't use a specific under I
setting powder because I don't have I
don't have dry or especially dry or oily
your eyes so I just use regular face
powders um and I've never done anything
different i have been loving this so
this is the best may brightening vanilla
powder in translucent I've been loving
this it's very finely milled it's smells
like vanilla it comes with this little
puff that I can't seem to get to work
for me but man it feels good it has a
little um the little sister here so what
I do is I tap this into that the lid or
whatever and then then use my brush and
put it in the cap but it smells really
good and this is this is sephora product
in case you were unaware of that are not
support product but you can get it at
sephora and it's relatively new and
what's up and make it we talked about
the violet one today so that i've been
really loving other ones as far as just
setting powders in general i like my
vincent longo one this isn't gold in
siena I do really like this one a lot
that one is a little bit overpriced
though my mac mineralize skinfinish i
really like i don't know i'm trying to
find ones the Milani one is pretty nice
on but if you have fine lines this one
will accentuate fine lines this is the
multi tasker face powder this one's a
medium i really like that one a lot but
yeah i just use regular face powder so i
don't know if that's helped oh you said
drugstore specifically sorry about that
totally didn't even read that correctly
i'm sorry show Milani rimmel the next
ones okay this is the NYX blotting power
this one's okay I have number two light
medium that one's pretty good but those
are the ones that I have that I like
definitely that's helpful boom boom boom
all right five minutes left oh I'm so
sad i hate when it comes down to five
minutes left it makes me sound alright
Samantha there are POF lip stains from a
Korean brand they want to send me those
for review should I review those
Samantha the peel off lip stains I'm
scared I show down to my co-workers
almost like I'm so freaked out right now
ah see now I'm thinking I'm like I
should probably say yes to them if you
know that I'm Samantha maybe I should
review them
now I'm thinking about it now I'm
thinking about it because you Samantha
be all your fault if I review them let's
see Christina do you have any tips for
taking off peel-off masks easier easier
I don't really use peel-off mask because
they're painful no I don't I don't use
it very often i got the friend and masks
what was it the influencer box and i'm
just not a big fan of mass so I don't
have any tips for taking them off easier
that's a lot of pain though I didn't
wasn't expecting that much pain well can
you just rinse those things off instead
of peeling them off is that possible to
just like use a cleanser will that break
it down I don't know I've never tried it
ok madam madam Bugsy says call me Bugsy
alright Bugsy okay apparently they have
legal issues to deal with I'm not sure
oh maybe talking about the people in
baltimore maybe I'm Steph still have you
tried the bombs highlighters yes oh
don't get--don't get Cindy Lou don't get
Cindy lucinda lou is not very good
Wilson English is like at the back of my
dorm where are you send Alou I told you
spent my lap don't be like bleeding on
you know okay yeah Mary Lou yeah Mary
Lou this is Cindy Lou don't get stimulus
Cindy Lou my Cindy Lou is broken but
it's just a weird of weird shade on if
you're have a deeper skin tone though
you might like Cindy Lou but if you're
my skin tone or later or even maybe a
little darker I mean you might not like
Cindy Lou but get married mary lou's
amazing but it's very bold so if you
like a more subtle highlight you
probably won't like it all right digico
have you tried the Korean brand three
cee known so I saw a lot of ads about at
them but I don't know if they're great
really don't know no I haven't but I
will keep my eye out for it cat's eye
view hello from Nebraska non beauty how
about hatchery box I have quite a few
hatchery box unboxings hatchery boxes
really fun you don't get a lot of bang
for your buck for hatchery but it's a
really fun box to get and it's fun to
try a lot of new things um it's an
artisan food subscription service so you
get like little jams and jellies or
little seasonings and spice rubs and
things
like that if you are a foodie I would
recommend it as long as you understand
you're not getting a ton of stuff for
the price you're getting about the value
that you're paying for like it's about
equal for what you would pay versus what
you get but it is a nice one I really
liked it when I got it I'd sing I keep
licking my lip cuz I know I'd get my lip
I probably looks terrible to him all
right ok ha thanks Jen and totally
unrelated but I've tried epsy for one
month and they gave me a broken lipstick
broken blush a plastic bag filled with
moisturizer to benefit everyone else oh

terrible story oh my gosh oh it's
terrible that didn't happen to me I've
gotten broken lipsticks and broken
blushes from them especially broken
blush is quite often amy says you have a
p.o box I do not have a p.o box I have
my husband's business address under the
about section of my youtube channel I
don't advertise it much because I feel
like it's one of those things where you
know you guys work so hard for your
money and for you guys to spend money on
sending things is kind of awkward for me
like it's kind of like I feel like you
guys I don't deserve you guys to spend
some money on these but I love letters

fantastic um so if you want to contact
me through a letter then feel free to
send a letter to that address again into

youtube that has lupus I know it's
really difficult to deal with when
they're going through some lupus moments

terrible

don't even know how to even speak
eloquently about that so I apologize if

is it worth the price it's worth the
half price it's totally worth a half
price get it on hold look well it's half
price I never buy the bomb full price

Danielle it's an iridescent like blue
with like purple iridescent sins got
Cheryl Cole just Gorgos loving this one
so many good ones so any good ones I
can't even tell you girlfriend I could
just tell you some brands that I really
like because there's so many you know
polishes that I love I love Sally Hansen
extreme where I love Maybelline Color
show the metallics line if you can find
those I'm pretty sure they don't sell
phones anymore though I love julep for
the most part I was a ninety percent of
polishes i love i love the ends to drive
from sally hansen's kind of hit or miss
for me but it's mostly hid from me ncla
i really like as a nail polish brands um
i'm not a huge OPI fan i'm not a huge
sefan ciate i'm not a huge fan of let's
say any other ones or leas hit or miss
for me let's say anything else i want to
mention formula x i really like for the
most part i tried their new the seashell
ones they're terrible don't get the
seashell ones um color club is hit or
miss for me it was all hit and then
recently I got this little mini-set and
these things are terrible
um but yeah that's that's a little
summary and nail polish stuff oh it's
1104 oh em said oh my goodness um flack
about the glamour and then the perfusion
glamour bars she wants to try them I
have a feeling they're not going to be
very good the perfusion glamour bars I'm
gonna push it another 10 minutes I'm
gonna do it because my family's not home
and i think i can get ready really
quickly so if i push it in our two
minutes let's go at all to 1115 let's
just keep going 15 10 more minutes ten
more minutes um let's see okay Alicia
hello everyone I keep forgetting what
time it starts pretty excited when i get
to hop in for a bit it starts at ten
a.m. eastern standard time every sunday
morning unless I have something going on
for some reason let's see uh did you uh
yodelin empower flower my shadows are
super dry and powdery now why why are
mine working well that's good to know
she has a trollop out Helen and it's
amazing but I really like mine why are
you guys eating yours I like laughing I
don't know I have to play with it more
and see if I can figure out why you guys
don't like it um nicole says Elise you
at 7am for specific or 10 a.m. eastern
yes that's true oh let's say I'm reading
through comments to each other Alexis
says i love you i love you do what you
reckon recommends packing for a trip
abroad makeup-wise you mean like in
general like what you're going to mean
oh I wish you wish that there'd be more
there was more detail their different
products that would work or just in
general um well we'll try to go with
both okay um so as far as like eye
shadow palettes that I would bring if I
was going on a trip abroad honestly I
would bring this I really like this this
is a little palette nude one I love this
palette I really do this was my favorite
of my drugs for pellets I have that
video that I still need to edit that's
going to be coming up but this is such a
nice court case and it comes with the
brush inside it takes a little bit
longer to apply the shadows with this
teeny tiny brush but it works it works
girlfriend for eyeshadow brushes if you
want really nice eyeshadow brushes to
take with you the ego tools has a little
it's like a little brush roll and
shadow brushes your amazing eye shadow
brush the one is really really big but
it works really well it's got a great
elbow crease brush that's fantastic in
there got a nice detailing brush and it
rolls up really small so I would
recommend that i do have a video where I
show you what I brought to I mats which
was a vlog you can check that out on my
channel and maybe get some other ideas
of some things that I brought for travel
when I went to New York but yeah I mean
those are definitely some must-haves for
me if I was going abroad let's say for
foundation I'm definitely you want to
take something that's not glass so you
know um honestly this is one this is a
foundation that nobody really talks
about acting like this this is a l'oreal
visible lift blur foundation feeling
like this it's nice full coverage and it
feels good it feels like a primer like a
silicone primer on those going on and
it's not really nice lasting power nor
ever talks about this when you pack a
foundation get one of the horns with the
soft 20 that will hope this is another
one that's really popular right now the
Loreal infallible Pro matte is really
popular right now it's just okay for me
um but yeah those would be some ones i
would recommend for travel Holly Bronwyn
good morning Jen broke my know by first
sephora.com order of the year Urban
Decay right house as it's supposed to be
good for the colour-pop liners I do have
that and I do really like my bright
house it's it's it's old I've had it
forever and it's still going very strong
i love this sharpener it's wonderful
let's say okay so seven minutes left and
then I got to go all right have you
tried Samantha said you tried the tards
true blood palette know and that is the
only tart I haven't really want to try
more but couldn't afford it until now
okay um let's see now I haven't tried
that okay Holly okay oh Simon perfume I
don't know if she's talking about two
perfumes yeah I don't know okay oh that
says thanks Jen of course i'll use your
code I just feel bad plug in my codes
you know but I want people to
no something have the choice and it's
nice get twenty dollars in credit you
know I mean we all we all like to have
free money you know and I'm honest and I
can't help it I can't help it I like
free money I do I like free money and I
can't help it I mean who doesn't like
free money but who admits that they like
free money nobody except for me because
I'm you know I can't shut my mouth when
it comes to being honest about things
and it may sound bad but it's real and
it's true and anybody that says they
don't like free money is lying you know
it's not gonna do this for the money I'm
not to do its do this for the money but
free money is nice you know I am I
terrible person I hope I look at all
this time I tell you guys and it's on
and it's recorded on the channel and
then people go back and then they twist
it but it is what it is the people who
love me will continue to love me even
when I say things that are questionable
all right let's move on from there
insert foot mouth disease right here
okay and that is a real disease but you
know all right I gotta move on I gotta
shut up all right Jessica Vaughan I
pretty much can only afford drugstore
products but if I want to splurge and
high-end make a product which one should
you choose um it depends on what you're
looking for I mean there's so many good
high end products I mean honestly like I
love my naked too I would always and
forever recommend this to somebody that
wants like a that wants to really get
something that is going to be amazing
and going be worth the purchase I always
recommend this and I can't get it back
in them thingy can't get it back in
there um things that are really truly
worth the purchase that the naked to man
the nigga to I mean there's a lot of
things like I love my Too Faced
lipsticks but do you need this now you
don't need that it's nice I really like
my Marc Jacobs lipstick but you need
that now you don't need that there's a
lot of stuff i really like but it's not
a need it's not something where I can be
like yes you will be so happy you spent
fifty dollars this is pretty much it
that i can think i'm off top of my head
that is truly truly worth the price
truly truly look at all the drawers just
to make sure i didn't miss anything
I mean there's a lot of things that are
great but nothing else stands out to me
that's it Bridget says hi Jan just want
to say i love you i love you too bridge
hi um I Bridget it was funny Bridget I
remember to a couple days ago she was
like you responded to me I'm like yes
we're all real people here you hear the
whole thing about you know people that
make Beauty videos and how they're so
like they don't respond to people and
you know people put them up on a
pedestal and it's like you know I said
this video before we all poop you know
we all like breathe we all you know it's
just we're all his people like it's not
that was really funny she's like you
were spotted me and it's like yes I did
and I'm going to keep responding to
people I'm always going to be me no
matter what if you look back in my very
first video you'll see I'm still the
exact same person that I was in my very
first videos if you look back to my old
channel Jen left 37 you'll see on the
exact same person I was on Jenna 37 I
was maybe a little more awkward when i
first started gentle up 37 but I'm still
the same person and I'm always going to
be the same person I I don't see that
changing even though it seems like
there's a disease people catch 100,000
subscribers that you know they start
turning fake but you know what she gon
idea what you're going to do that ain't
going to be me though I'll tell you that
