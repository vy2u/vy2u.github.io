Mother's Day I'm a little tired this
morning but thank you for asking I've
got my coffee so I'm good to go i watch
your six drug store house of you um well
all of your videos and so let me say I
love your honesty thank you so much I
try really hard to really give a good
I've kind of really analyze the products
before I talk about them is that way i
can give you a really accurate picture
of what i truly think like I really make
a conscious effort to think about things
you know because you know you put makeup
on and sometimes it's easy to forget
what's happening so I try to really um
you know really think about it
throughout the day as i'm applying at
things that I would want you guys to
know so you are very welcome I wish that
some of the so called beauty gurus have
money subscribe subbies could be real
and honest yeah I don't know what's up
with that um you know I to each her own
I mean everyone wants to run their
channel differently it's their channel
and they can do with it what they like
I'm gonna do what I like and I don't see
that changing anytime I really don't
you know so you're welcome and yay and
then mary says she has a two-part
question first I don't know if anyone
has asked us already but how will you be
doing things for the summer well you did
a live chat on Sundays or what you wants
in a while do it on a weekday we be
uploading more I will definitely be
uploading more I do want to keep the
sunday chat I don't know I might I don't
know I don't know what's going to happen
I think that's I would gonna have to
talk about that as a crew as far as what
we want to do over the summer as far as
a chat do we want to move it to like
later in the day do we want to do
evening chaps like what do we want to do
so I want I don't want people to have an
opportunity to join because I know this
is really early in the morning for a lot
of people especially people on the west
coast some people in other countries
like this is not a convenient time so I
accommodate a lot more people so we'll
see I haven't decided on that part the
second part I know this is not makeup
related but I was watching a prego
diaries those are my old pregnancy
videos back of my old channel which was
gentle of 37 and I saw the one where you
were talking about names how did you
come with come up with Lila um my
daughter my seven-year-old is Lila um we
had a really hard time naming her I
because I didn't I couldn't figure out
what I want a neighbor because I hadn't
met her yet so we had a couple of names
in the bank we weren't quite sure what
we wanted to name her my
great-grandfather's name was Larry and
my mother's side of the family my cats
are about to fight they fight a lot um
my great-grandfather's name was Larry
which is and that's out of family is
Jewish and in the Jewish tradition you
name children after the first letter of
the name of a deceased person that you
loved so that was part of it also my
last name is really really really long
so I wanted Lila to have a nice easy
name to go with that really long last
name and we just really liked it and
that song hey there delilah was really
popular right then and I would take took
a nap and I woke up and the song was
playing it was like oh I don't really
like Delilah but life was kind of nice
so long story short too late that's kind
of how i came up with Lila um and it's
been a kind of a challenge with that
name be
people want color Leela people aren't
used to it but you know it's a good name
we really like it she likes it a lot um
she's very happy that nobody else has
her name and growing up as a jennifer
and having you know for Jennifer's in my
class I really wanted her to have a
unique name all right but that was a
great question Mary thank you so much

then nikki says the selah blush looks
identical to the Amazonian clay full
coverage airbrush foundation with the

seen one with the netting huh cool I
guess so everybody's invented everything
you know something there's nothing new I
thought it was new she said powder
foundations work better for her liquid

really difficult to work with sometimes
it sets too fast and then it doesn't
blend beauty by Tara be good morning yay
happy Mother's Day so happier here Tara
hey nikki says also HSN they have twenty
dollars off and a forty dollar purchase
for new customers ooh that's neat and
then she's got the code there whoo so if
you want twenty dollars off a forty
dollar purchase at HSN and you've never
shopped at HSN before the code is on
Nikki's got it there at six five four
three nice alright Kiersey Wallace top
three youtubers I like to watch Sanders
ha I don't mean lots of people there are
a lot of people that I've been loving
lately oh my goodness um puts me on the
spot because I had so many friends here
on YouTube but it's like who do I pick
you know there's so many channels that I
absolutely love and I gave John my phone
there's been some really big standouts
lately of channels that I've been
watching a lot I've been watching a lot
Kristen game is always one of my
favorites um who else um Cassie from
thrift thick I never miss her videos
Karina kaboom I know she's a little
angry sometimes and I could freenas
watch this I love you Karina but you're
a little angry sometimes but i watch all
of our videos to nail polish channel I
and just the way she describes polishes
she gives a really good she talked about
how many coats they go on and she's like
you know too thin coats one thick one
and she talks about the finish and
starts about why she likes it why she
doesn't like it she's really good at UM
ed polishes and and describing polishes
another one that just came back and I
hope he stays because I love him is a
channel called the frag aholic and there
was a rumor that he was dead and it was
a rumor for like a year but somebody
commented on my comment like I left a
comment like nine months ago and
somebody left a comment too bad we'll
never see him again and I was like in
the world so I look back and it was like
he's on the top you know 100 deceased
youtubers list I was like oh my gosh
like I hope he's not really dead so I
don't know but like oh like yesterday he
puts up a video saying he's being he's
really disturbed that people are saying
he's dead so it must have been it might
have been because of the people
commenting to my comments look like
10,000 subscribers but he is the best
perfume reviewer on the planet in the
frag aholic oh my goodness if you want
to learn how to review perfumes or if
you're curious about perfume see most of
us levy perfumes the best perfume review
channel ever well one of the only
perfume reviews channels I've ever seen
but it's amazing and he's so stinkin
funny he's hilarious like I die over
this channel that's I didn't mean it
like that because people said thought
they cut him said but oh my gosh best
channel you've got to see him he's only
a horse he just came back and sometimes
he says he's going back and he makes one
video and he goes away for three months
but I really hope he stays because he's
amazing I know that was a really long
answer there's a lot more people that I
like to watch I mostly watch will tell
you this there are very few channels
that i watch that are over a hundred
thousand subscribers one that i watch i
watch and ream italiano i watch um gem
beauty 89 and watch Melissa Raymond um
but that's pretty much it for channels
over 100,000 subscribers because i don't
i typically stop liking people after
100,000 subscribers because they they
end up getting weird really weird oh and
i usually end up on subscribing i
usually start getting annoyed and
unsubscribe i would much rather watch
people that
have 10,000 subscribers or 2,000
subscribers or 500 subscribers than
somebody with 500,000 subscribers that's
just me I don't really get the appeal of
the perfect face in the perfect
background but no personality I don't
get that at all but that's what people
like sometimes I guess I don't know and
I think I sound so like such a brat
right now I saw me such a brat I don't
mean to sound like such a brat but it's
just like I feel like there are so many
really good solid channels that don't
necessarily have the perfect everything
but I have really good videos and I just
wish that they got more attention you
know what I mean so I mean like the
Franco holic I mean you look at his
videos they're not the hundred-percent
best quality doesn't have the most
beautiful background but man those
videos are awesome so I don't know
hopefully I didn't come off as a brat
but you know I I feel like I'm talking
my friends here and I feel like I can
just kind of blah blah blah out there
and I've never been one to hide Who I am
or what I think or want to believe even
if people want to Sara Lee agree with me
so mm-hmm all right moving on moving on
from know the long answer all right
nikki says oh let's see she's talking
she's talking more sales all the two
faces free shipping semi-sweet palette
my goodness okay Kathy says good morning
jen i love the interviews to your videos
thank you it makes her smile this last
week any chance you would do some
cooking videos again like on your other
channel I would really like to the
problem is is there's only so many hours
in the day you should see the stack of
papers I have to grade it's stupid it's
stupid sagol papers i showed my one my
classes yesterday I was like this stack
of papers is what you alternate
yesterday so there's a reason why it's
not in the grade book yet just them
online grade book so it's just my point
is is that I would like to do cooking
videos I just don't have time I'm having
enough trouble getting my current
content out without adding a whole other
topic but I really really really want to
maybe one day if I can stop teaching and
do this full time then I could do more
of that I would really love to revive
gentle off 37 and do like a vlog channel
over there I think that would be amazing
so I would really love to Sarah says
good morning Jenna happy mother's day
thank you me and my 7 month old Jovi are
watching together Oh give jovi a big
squeeze
me happy Mother's Day happy first
Mother's Day oh oh let's see lisa says
good morning what's a good foundation
for summer okay i mostly use BB creams
and summer to be completely honest don't
use a lot of foundations oh let's see
what are some lighter foundations hmm
light like I have this one this is the
buxom show some skin weightless
foundation but i'm not big family cuz it
doesn't have the glass in power let's
say lighter lighter lighter and lighter
i need i need any new ones because i
really don't feel like Oh see I need new
makeup like I need a hole in the head um
well the Garnier BB cream I really
really like this a lot I would
definitely recommend this one this one
is a little bit more full coverage
though for a BB cream it's got a really
nice oh I really like my hourglass
I would imagine this is going to be
really great for summer because it's
pretty light the UM the serum found it
gets like a serum foundation it's liquid
to powder foundation mattifying
foundation i really like that a lot I
would imagine that's going to be good
but I haven't used that yet or summer
because I just got this year see a lot
of these I just got this year and I
don't think they're selling this anymore
i love this this is the ponds BB cream I
don't think they sell this anymore this
is what I used all summer last year all
summer last year but I want to sell it
anymore oh don't want my kids are doing
ok you guys would definitely be the ones
i'm looking forward to using yeah i wish
i could give you more recommendations I
need to try out some more things this
hour because a lot of the stuff that i
was using last summer I don't have
anymore so I need to re-up on my BB
creams alright let's see jessica says
you know anything about it cosmetics
I've looked at your older videos and
didn't see anything yes I do have
a little bit of it cosmetics up I have
this this is the cosmetics naturally
pretty palette hey John John Calipari
you're being distracting I need you not
to bring stuff in here sweetie those
people are trying to focus and it's hard
when there's a little person run by I'm
sorry okay it cosmetics actually pretty
a lot of people don't like this I love
this um they did people say that it
muddies up I don't have that problem
I've never had that problem with this
bunny muddying up hopefully it's not
doing too much of a glare I'll put that
away but I really like this palette a
lot some things that I have that I don't
really like I've got one show you my
call later I don't like this highlighter
at all this is the hello light cream
illuminator it just got really hard
really fast it dried out really fast I
don't I don't like this highlighter at
all it's pretty terrible like it all was
the it cosmetics the tight line foolish
length black primer more menezes was
called full lash length black primer
with peptide enhancing serum this was
supposed to be for your tight line it's
this weird little brush it worked for
about a month maybe two months before it
dried out and I don't really like this
product let's see anything else from it
cosmetics that I have their brushes are
amazing the brushes are fantastic and
the powder brush I had the big huge
powder brush the handle broke because I
used it so much you see how you've been
still not adhere I might have put it
away because now it's like a nub like
the ball emo band then this stick is
gone but there are brushes are amazing
they're really really good i'm trying to
think there's anything else i owned by a
cosmetics I think that's it um so yeah I
mean if I was going to say try anything
first I would say the brushes and their
eyeshadows are pretty good too so there
you go let's see Roxanne said my son's
durable thanks he's cute he just you
know he's strong willed and that's not a
bad thing let's see what Lori says she

two weeks ago but I forgot I forgot
afterwards okay I remember you being in

morning Lily um are she says good
morning happy Mother's Day thank you so
much I notion of a lot of nail polishes
do you have any do you love any specific
1i talked about this a little bit last
week I don't love any specific nail
polish more than others um just because
I have so many favorites in my nail
polish collection so many things that i
absolutely love some brands that I love
consistently our formula X julep Sally
Hansen extreme where even though it
cracks um yeah it'll like actually
crackle on my nails but it's less
expensive so I don't mind you know
painting my nails more often the
Maybelline Color show is the metallics
long if you can find that is amazing um
let's say I don't mind the wet and wild
mega slicks as far as comparison with
the sally hansen extreme where those are
pretty nice let's see anything else
those are kind of my favorite brands of
nail polish but I have so many favorite
nail polishes like it's kind of
ridiculous so I i don't i don't even
know i wouldn't even know what to say as
far as my favorite nail polish right now
i'm wearing the one that i got in my
sephora the vib rouge bag actually think
that John got this when it's called
quantum and then I put little giraffes
on it I don't know if you can see this I
stamp little drafts on it let's see if I
can get that tough
aren't they cute my little giraffes but
this has lasted me this is the fourth
day I've had this on and you can see
there's no chipping no chipping so I
really really like the formula x um
formula a lot I do um yeah and then i
use my um i always use my seche vite top
coat i know some people don't like this
but i really love it so yeah that's a
little nail polish action going on for
you are she okay and then Lily says tom
at New Mexico dicta oh it lets me use my
down arrow ok let's see okay Nikki's
talking about that um the Sephora bronze
or she said it was at the set though at
the store but it's not on the website
yet the bronzer kid this for favorites
browser kit that's really cool okay
Nikki said I'm Nikki's talking to Lily
okay Oh amber was flagged as spam
flagged as spam now not spam amber not
spam Thank You amber she said good
morning and happy Mother's Day not spam
for Amber okay what Co ever says what
company would you like to team up with
kathleen lights in color pop ah see you
like any company that I would want to
team up with I don't think that they
would they team up with people like if I
could collaborate with kat von d that
would be pretty I don't think that's
possible you know um I don't know like a
little like a small brand I don't know
man that's that's a great question no
that's a tough question what brand would
I want to partner up with honestly like
I'd love to partner up with Eddie Andy
brand I think that would be fun you know
just somebody that has really good
quality products you know like um how
Samantha Elley teamed up with serenity
in Scott and I know I'm Sanders if
you're still here Sanders this doesn't
work for any and Scott their quality of
their eye shadow
is amazing i looked on their website
though and they're really expensive so i
don't know like how that would work like
they're there 9p and shadows with like
eighty dollars are so ridiculous like
are you kidding me like they're good but
eight dollars like what um so I don't
know what's up with that but it would
have to be a company the number one puts
out really quality products number two
they have to be relatively reasonably
priced it can't be astronomically priced
because that's just that most my
subscribers won't be able to buy and I'm
not trying to promote something that'll
you know makes him a break the bank you
know I'm saying um even I think they did
they did bump the price down for
Samantha's palette bit I think but um
yeah I mean honestly like I be open you
know because it's just it'll be fun to
just design some products as long as
they were they would have to be really
good quality that would just be my
number one thing hopefully that answered
question I know that's terrible to not
really be specific but I've never tried
colour-pop products so I don't I can't
really speak to those of course I've
heard amazing things but I can't really
speak to those and I don't think they
are there Goma Danny and Kathleen which
is not me so so chances are they would
not want me to be with them because
they're their channels are very
different than mine oh let's see Thank
You siding about Karina's channel um
yeah Oh Stacy from polish ways I have
been youtube friends with Stacy for Bosh
ways since I had like 400 subscribers
like it's been at Stacy and I have been
friends for a really long time she is
Larry she's very loud though like people
get on me about yelling at the camera if
you want to see someone yell at the
camera go to Stacy a Polish with that
girl yells at the camera look she's just
so passionate about nail polish I do
love Stacy though she's hilarious she's
really funny I love Stacy let's see glad

beauty Hoff 11 Jenna me try the new
cover effects custom drops yet no no
Lily told me they were sticky so I
haven't gotten them yet i haven't been
to sephora recently I've been really
busy with my jobby job is crazy right
now like I so much going on with my job
and then with videos and editing and the
kids in the house my husband's been
working like a crazy person because
we're trying to move so he hasn't been
doing as much around houses he normally
does because he's just not home to do it
so I've been picking up a lot there
where I'm used to him doing a lot around
the house like he's my house husband
usually does a lot of that stuff but he
hasn't been doing it cuz he's been
working so much so I've been doing a lot
of the stuff around the house and I just
it's just been crazy lately so I have
not made it to sephora um but I do i do
want to try them even though the last
time Lily told me something to tell me
Lily told me about the shade and light
contour palette that she loved the
colors but it doesn't blast on her and I
was like well try it anyway I'll get it
and I totally agree with her and I'm
probably gonna end up returning it even
though it's beautiful to go on it just
doesn't last so I'll probably end up
returning that I don't know I haven't
decided yet I haven't decided because
it's nice for filming you know to do the
contour and I don't have it on that long
when I'm filming so you know I might
still keep it I haven't said yet but no
but Lily said that it didn't ever set
completely and it'll fade a little
sticky on her skin she now I'm scared to
try it but I probably will get it anyway
and then just return it if I don't like
it because it's just so neat like I
would love to
the custom color dress with like with
like a good like sunscreen or with some
of like my oils and things I think
that'll be awesome so all right
hopefully that answers your question so
no I haven't gotten them but I do want
to get them Florrie said first talk ok
let's see enormous says Jen happy
mother's day thank you so much i enjoy
how you tell it like it is i tried to
girlfriend i try to actually I've never
been one to sugarcoat things in my life
like I've never been somebody that would
do that like I've always been extremely
open that's just who I am as a person so
I don't think I can have a channel any
other way Holly says hello speaking of
perfumes she's been afraid you fragrant
East us since age 13 that's awesome
blend oh the black number 6 clean moscas
gorgeous really that's the one where you
get like all the different um you get
like a bunch of different ones and then
you can mix them together to make your
own custom sense shorter from Sephora
last week and Katie puck rick is your
favorite set reviewer I will definitely
have to check that out Katie Couric okay
I don't have anything to write with off
the horn I'm not taking puck Rick we do
I have to write with I don't even know I
don't have anything right left okay I'm
just gonna have to remember that or yeah
I'll just have to remember that Katie
pakrik okay yes off to check that and
see if she's better than the frago holic
because greg is amazing all right ponds
BB cream is sold here in the philippines
oh it is okay so it looks like it's
relatively inexpensive they're very cool
and let me go back and make sure I know
how to pronounce your name because I
didn't because it's definitely not
phonetic in any way and I want to go
back and I don't want to get it wrong
shayna shayna ok shayna shayna shayna i
have to remember that he is going to
underline that so hard for me to
remember Shana ok so should thank you
shana off the check and see if you guys
seen the paws BB cream still in the
stores i think they sold it anymore but
that would be awesome if they did if
they do sell it i definitely recommend
the pawns BB cream um let's see
okay let me see okay Becky says yeah you
made it Becky thoughts on the makeup
revolution iconic Pro palette they look
just like the lorac Pro I I've heard of
those I know nothing about it I have no
education about that at all I haven't
seen them um but I don't I don't know
anything about them i wish i knew
something Becky I'm sorry I finally made
it you have a question that I don't know
the answer do outside Jessica's talking
about my son being a goober behind me
let's see oh the bye bye under eye
throughout the about that we're talking
about the it cosmetics I got a sample
size of the bye-bye under eye and I
really really liked it a lot it is
really intense though like no joke like
you have to use the teeniest tiniest
little amount of that concealer and in
it over like it's just blue it's crazy
i've also heard that it creases on
people if you have a lot of fine lines
in your eyes it did not crease on me but
that doesn't mean it won't crease on
other people so let's see what is your
all-time favorite foundation all-time
favorite if i had to pick one foundation
as my all-time favorite it would be this
one this is the glass immaculate liquid
to powder foundation i love the stuff i
wish it was a better color match for me
it's not a perfect color match for me so
I do have to mix it with other things
right now hopefully what after I've
started self-tanning a little bit i'm
not sure if you notice but i still
probably not in this lighting but I
started self-tanning a little bit so I'm
hoping that this will turn into my
naturals not my neck well the skin color
that I am once i start self-tanning a
bit but this definitely is amazing it's
probably my favorite as far as drug
store right now be enabling fit me matte
and poreless but again I've said this
before and I will say it again it is for
normal to oily skin not for dry skin it
sticks to dry patches but I love this
stuff to own another one I use I know
you said one but these are different
kinds of products that lumi and CC cream
is amazing as well I really love that
and they're different types of products
so I'll go with the hourglass but then
there's a couple of bonuses on there
ok let's see Sarah says my birthday's
next month and i'm from australia with
the best I shadows to buy online I don't
know what you can get in Australia I
don't know what you can get and what you
can't get and I don't know what you
liked so if you like natural eye shadows
I would say go with one of the urban
decay naked palettes whichever one close
to you I would especially recommend the
naked one or the naked too because the
three has so many mixed reviews i don't
own it I own the two and i love it it is
what partially what inspired the
continuation of this as a makeup channel
because it is so easy to use it's
amazing also the lorac Pro if you'd like
something with a little bit more color
or if you like these tones the lorac pro
2 is one that i can speak personally
about I've heard a lot of course lots of
good things about the original rap
battles are so fun to play with I really
really like these gloves so those would
be my two recommendations if you can get
those but I don't know what you can get
in Australia but if you can get those I
would say those let's see Tara says have
you tried to Joe up oxygen base coat I
tried this week and I got bubbles oh
yeah well it is an oxygen based
oxygen-based so yes if you know infused
bubbles I haven't had that problem with
mine I like it I don't see anything
magical about it but I haven't had
bubbles with it oh no you should let
them know that you got bubbles with it
especially if it's brand new and maybe
they'll do something as far as credit in
your account because that's not that's
not right that shouldn't happen to you I
nikki says she has over 600 polishes oh
goodness girlfriend what do you want to
tell me buddy no we're not going to
grandma off today until you do okay
well we can call them and see what
they're doing but I don't think we're
going to be able to go see them today
because it's short notice no I'm not
finish I'm in the middle of chat right
now 20 minutes left but can I talk to
you much what you known as please ok all
right ok I know sweetheart but I'm
almost done ok maybe 20 minutes please
Lila can you take your brother Henry
please not so much all right John
oh okay all right I'm trying I'm trying
guys but I can't I can't they're my kids
and they love me and I have trouble I
can't I've trouble so you know it's real
life okay uh Nikki said she has 600
polishes she needs the D stash I needed
these dash 2 i'm totally with you um she
loves seche vite to sucka says for the
vi BMW brugge sephora they got a new
gift from Bobbi Brown oh really I think
there is up there wait there was a new
gift like you actually got it like for
free or was it with points because i
think i saw a 500-point bobbi brown line
but yeah I mean there's there's a lot
they have a lot of good perks at sephora
Diane says I didn't want to count how
many Polish they have I know I'm
overflowing out of my trays there I mean
I'm like this is this is look at this I
am overflowing and I've got some in a
drawer over here like I am overflowing
it's stupid and my stupid but just
ordered from jewel up the $30 may
mystery box that's how I get a lot of
jewel polishes as i get the mystery
boxes it's thirty dollars the two
polishes that are they've said that are
in there look amazing there's like a
beautiful pink and a beautiful purple
and they don't have any colors like
those so i really wanted to get that and
then it's like 130 dollars or some
stupid of stuff in there for thirty
dollars and that's a lot really how I
get a lot of my polishes is from that so
I don't know why I got it because I
wanted it that's why and I haven't I
haven't bought anything this month for
the first ten days may I bought nothing
nothing and the only thing i bought in
April was the stuff I bought I mats and
I didn't buy that much like that so and
the div Russo and I didn't buy that much
so I felt like I was being pretty good
so I got it do I need more polishes no I
don't need more polishes I don't know
what's wrong with me let's see let's see
um
nikki says she doesn't care for the base
or top coats from julep interesting yeah
I think they're fine they're not amazing
she liked his always Chloe walk system I
have some soy polishes that i really
like I don't know a lot about their um
about like their bases and top coats
though I haven't gotten into those all
right Shayna says what camera do you use
to film I don't know what it is honestly
let me get it know what it is so he so
don't try to tell me what it is it's
this right here this thing right here
this Wow got to drop it this is the sony
nex-5 t odd John bought this is a
vlogging camera i have a canon t3i and I
like this better it auto focuses and I
really like the couple the quality of it
so I switched over to this and this is
considerably cheaper than the Canon t3i
and I really really like it a lot so yes
this is what I used to film and the lens
cap isn't on it it's on the floor oh my
step 1 sometimes when I'm done filming
at one o'clock in the morning I just
forget to put the lens cap back on all
right but that's that's what it used to
film let's see Tyler we just got an
email that beauty calm friends and
family sale starts this week twenty
percent off what that's good to know
lots of good stuff on beauty calm oh
you're saying it says YouTube is not
letting me see you I'm no hit refresh
refresh ascend you refresh okay ooh
lucka says code vib long for the bobby
brown stuff cool thanks flaca okay nikki
says Jen did you get the KL colour-pop
quad no I had their products and had to
grab hers they just came out with
branches a few days ago so my next or
will be highlights of bronzers I saw a
review and I can't remember throw my
head who is review it was of the
highlighters and she got all of them and
she did not like them she said it's a
totally different formula than the
eyeshadows and the blushes and she did
not like them she's like you know if it
ain't broke don't fix it kind of thing
and they completely bombed the
highlighters according to her so you
might want to watch and reviews before
you buy too many of the highlighters
as far as the bronzers I don't know
anything about those one day I may get
some color pops off one day I might not
I mean they're just it's you to be just
so saturated with color pop and it's
like do I need color pop yeah I just I
liked being different you know and this
is like I don't know I don't know if
I'll ever get it I don't know um oh ok
so Shana says the the LA splash lip
Couture I got one at IMATS and I did
like it tips for you ok that's another
one um I did like it it was very
pigmented it didn't have a lasting power
as the other one the other la splash one
silly splash now I don't remember I have
it here in my dog I still have my ims
bag like sitting next to me but not
everything is in here because i've been
using things now that's a nail polish
terrible nail polish speaking of nail
polish system is terrible this is called
the Everglades extended where it's my
China Glaze a horrible it's horrible i
got five of them and they're terrible no
of course it's not in here you know i
got i hadn't even ever heard of those la
splash thing he's before Lent I mats and
then I heard everybody talking about
slick out that song and then I I don't
know what more all I did was unworthy
hmm we say ok here we go but this is la
girl see that's that's what I don't
that's why I needed to find it this is
the LA girl flat finished pigment glossy
I don't even know what I'm talking about
i buy so much stuff girlfriend i buy so
much stuff I lose track of things yeah I
didn't get la splash I got la girl but
this time was kind of good this one is
in I didn't know how to shoot bizarre I
was wearing this in one of the videos
but it goes i'm kind of whalley but it
dries really nice it dries really pretty
I wore that in one of my um I'm at
sloggi things and i can't i bought
another one I don't know what wrong
that but it wasn't le splash see this is
the thing I watch a lot of big names so
I miss a lot of this stuff you know all
the ones that are like the big hike
things I missed up unless somebody under
100,000 subscribers is talking about it
I don't even see it i'm subscribed to
nicole guerrero and i'm subscribed to um
with younger Jacqueline hill but I don't
really watch their videos much even
though I probably should I'm not saying
they're bad not saying they're bad and I
think that they seem like really nice
people but I just I'm not as interested
in their videos for some reason like
they don't call to me I don't know
they're just so perfect and I perfection
isn't attractive to me I don't know is
that bad I mean when somebody looks
perfect does everything perfect that's
not attractive to me as far as somebody
I want to watch I'd rather watch someone
that is perfectly imperfect oh do you
like my mug by the way what part of no
don't you understand I got that for my
students because you know I just I was
cute some of them left some of them
don't get it at all let's say okay
moving on YouTube tips for beginners
okay biggest tip forty-eighters is to
know what you're going to say before you
start filming so have an idea of where
you want to go what you want to do what
you want to talk about but my biggest
tip for beginners is don't apologize
don't apologize for your lighting don't
apologize for your camera don't
apologize for your cold that you have
because nothing will turn me off more to
a channel then when somebody comes on
that says I just want to apologize my
hair looks like crap today I've been out
in the Sun and you know my hair just
really frizzy and I'm sorry for my
lighting it's like get to the point I
didn't I ain't come here to watch you
you know feel bad about why you're not
perfect it's okay not to be perfect just
just talk about the makeup talk about
what you love don't be self-conscious of
all the things that make you not perfect
like just be you and you are perfect the
way you are and talk about what you came
to talk about jump right into it give
people information that they will
appreciate and they will love and and
they love you you just don't stop
apologizing I get so tired of going to
channels that people say to check out my
channel and then all it is in every
beginning of every
do for the first two minutes is
apologies like it's okay it's okay just
tell me about the makeup um yeah and
then just kind of have a plan you know
get in get into the topic say what you
want to say give all that great useful
information and then pop out of the
video um you know all right but that
those are my biggest tips for beginners
so and I love you too thank you for
keeping coming back to chat all right
let's see ok Nikki's just talking to me
about color pop so I just read that

makeup bag in this one and it looks
beautiful one hundred fifty dollars in

minimizing them um I I tell everybody at
this effort everybody I'm like dude

under eye bags Angela says love from
Chicago I went to Chicago once when I
was 20 and I successfully got kicked out
of all of the clubs there and to the
point where I actually went to one club
and they gave me a fake ID that didn't
look anything like me it was like a
woman that looked like she was from
India and I tried to use it at the next
club and it was bad it was bad I was I
was three weeks away from turning 21 and
I got kicked out of all the clubs but it
was fun it was fun we had a good time
meet my friend and I Tara says what do
you use for lighting your videos right
now I'm using just a ring light I have a
diva I oh no no no it's diva like brand
but I have one ring light is all i'm
using right now i have some box lighting
but i'm too lazy to set it up my last
please tell me because my last what's up
and make a video the one that went up
today I like I lit a bit differently I
put it really high up instead of around
the camera like I normally do shall let
me help the lighting look better in that
video than it typically does or if it
look the same or whatever but if you
notice any difference let me know
because I'm really really curious as to
see because a big critique that I get is
my videos or too dark compared to a lot
of the more pro channels
so I'm trying to improve on that I have
no natural light like this is my natural
light what you're seeing right now
that's it I have a little window here I
have two little windows over there that
is all I've got so I would love to hear
your comments about my lighting if you
have any suggestions but that's all I
use is one ring light right now alright
it's eleven o'clock let me see if
there's anything I can answer quickly
