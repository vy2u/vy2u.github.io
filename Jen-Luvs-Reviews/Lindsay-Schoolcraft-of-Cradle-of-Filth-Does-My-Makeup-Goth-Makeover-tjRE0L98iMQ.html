guest today this is Lindsey Schoolcraft
and if you do not know her she is a
singer and musician a songwriter an
amazing all-around person she's actually
on an international tour right now and I
have interrupted her tour to invite her
over here she is currently on tour with
the band Cradle of Filth
yeah so uh yeah little contrary to my
current persona Lindsey's gonna go ahead
and do my makeup and we're gonna chat
about Cradle of Filth and about music
and makeup and all of that and I'm so
excited so if that sounds awesome to you
hang tight we're getting into it right
now what are we gonna do today as far as
makeup hello editing Jen here I just
want to do a quick apology to Lindsey
and to you because I realized as I was
editing that my camera was not it was
zooming back as far as it could be but I
realized as I was editing that Lindsey
was not in frame for some of the video
when she gets into the tutorial part she
is in frame pretty much the entire time
but I did want to let you know that I am
aware she was out of frame and I'm
really sorry for that but there's
nothing I can do in editing just because
that was where the frame was fully
zoomed back so I do apologize but it is
a really great video and I can't wait
for you to meet Lindsey if you don't
know her
hopefully you still enjoy the video and
let's get to that right now Lindsey does
the makeup for Cradle of Filth I forgot
to mention that so whenever you see the
band if you're a fan of the band Lindsey
does all of the makeup so what are we
gonna be doing today you think okay so I
didn't have much time to think about it
last night but then it clicked when I
was doing my makeup this morning that
I'm just gonna give you one of my
classic looks fabulous it's my favorite
go-to look that I use quite a bit um and
it works for stage and the meet and
greets and photoshoots and music videos
is just gonna give you that classic look
and it's kind of I'm not sure if you're
familiar with these terms is it's darker
it kind of falls into the new golf
category where the Gothic culture is
taking sick examples of pop culture
styles so it's called new cough if you
look it up it's it's a lot of stuff
there okay you probably know I may not
know but you probably this is a pain in
the butt but I use it all the time I use
the cool contour and that's where I get
like my Maleficent cheeks from fabulous
I'll see what I can do for you I think
we can make nice so Kat Von D is yes she
is she's so lovely she actually it's Kat
Von D's fault that I got someone to make
up she sent me a care package about
three years ago
to my door and just like I actually I
have the chrysalis palette right here it
has been used and abused and loved it's
been around the world with me and she
sent me this along with a bunch of other
goodies and because of her like I owe
her a massive thank you for getting me
so interested in makeup artistry I've
loved this one a little too much use
this as a highlighter this is obviously
like for a contour and lightening up so
it is it's my go-to this is like being
in cradle felt actually Danny is about
to make me hit pan on swing because he
loves it so much I it's on his eyes
every night and Danny's a lead singer
yes he's our lead singer he has quite
the look and I mean I'm using this to
contour his eyes and everything so I
love it
I'm not disappointed for grabbing it and
I don't know why people don't mention
the quads from Kat Von D yeah and
there's any of those you don't I don't
they're so underrated um you know I I
love them the formula is fantastic I use
the pink in here as my blush oh and it's
amazing like these are gorgeous you put
them on and think once they blend in
with your skin like this is a vampire
go-to but this one here is what we're
gonna base your look on so we've got
that and we've got the holographic which
is just like I do own this why do I have
that one mine's a little dirty right now
cuz it's a little too loved on the road
we use it for everything I even actually
put it on Danny
I realize everything was so Kat Von D
this is this is fantastic I noticed in
the makeup world in artistry and the
tutorials everyone wants to just
highlight the crap out of their face
it's true I like it on the cheeks I
think it makes you look like some kind
of mythical creature but then the rest
of the face this is my setting powder
which is the blotting powder that's like
a mattifying powder and this is as you
can see it's been used a lot I actually
have a refill pan waiting for me in
Toronto when I get home next week and
this is what I travel with there is a
bunch of really weird stuff in there
there's unicorn brushes there's Kat Von
D there is zoeva sugar pill I can't even
pronounce the name of this one do you
know how to say that name I'm Kelly um
yeah yes mmhmm yeah not the silent
letters don't work well for me
so it's and one thing I was very
impressed with is that they're
impeccably clean oh yes okay so
something about being on the road is if
you don't keep your stuff clean you're
gonna get sick you're gonna get an eye
infection you're gonna get a throat
infection so this is kind of also my end
of the night calm down after a show
clean my brushes it's like that little
downtime thing and I already did my
foundation and concealer but that's all
I've put on I just kind of grabbed
random things yeah I think I wore this
in one video
and then I couldn't bring myself to wear
it again it's really cute though feel
like rockabilly gobbling this is orgoth
all over this video so I'm gonna use the
black but I'm not going to do it over
too much something I like about black
powder and I use it for my own eyebrows
is like if my hair is black or if it
fades to brown you can't really tell
with the eyebrows so I'm like a little
nervous right now I won't lie this is
this is like really exciting because
usually people are like especially my
moms like your makeups too much like you
know why don't why do you why do you do
that and I'm just like well mom like you
know what I mean like it's I'm gonna
cough man so it's gonna be so I actually
really like the natural shape of your
eyebrows thank you and by the way I am
NOT a makeup artist at all I was telling
John earlier that I've actually just
like been taught by some friends in the
industry luckily they're in like special
effects and really crazy
artsy makeup but oh this is gonna be
good you have a really nice shape dear
eyebrows oh thank you I'm excited that's
the thing I'm always worried like I've
done wedding makeup and like casual
makeup and I'm always like I'm gonna
turn this person into a witch I think
the fans are gonna be really excited to
know all my secrets now yes because
you're gonna post this on Cradle of
Filth stuff to it yeah yeah well they
want to know because I want to know more
about like my makeup and Danny's makeup
and when you're consistently doing music
you just never find the extra time to
like film a video do you know what
laughing at Leah I wish I had more time
to do videos at home by the minute I got
home it's like okay get
Studio go-go-go yeah bet so yes it's
like an angled brush I don't even know
the brand it's rubbed off it came from
my friend from the industry and she's
like yeah just have this and it's my
favorite brush don't you get that one
like you have this favorite brush and
you have no idea where it came from who
made it awake you're like this is my
brush sorry
so get a good angled brush one you want
to do
powdered eyebrows this is like crazy I
can't believe I'm doing your makeup it's
so exciting and do you want to tell them
like why it's like how you know me I was
working at that bar right and I was like
making the money to do my solo album
Sunday nights my my downtime was like
I'm just gonna watch like makeup
tutorials and lie in bed need a whole
tub of ice cream okay that's how I roll
on Sundays my routine and you popped up
with like the makeup news and I'm like
oh this is this is perfect
so yeah you became like my go-to and now
every time you open my iPad my YouTube
home is just riddled with fear so she
connected with me on Twitter oh yeah and
then we just started talking back and
forth and my husband's a big fan of
Cradle of Filth so he was super excited
and I was excited for him and then I
started talking to Lindsay and that
realize how awesome person she is for
fun so it was it's you know it was a
connection yeah connect yeah success
smart chicks we gotta stick together
absolutely no and that's why I liked
your what's up and makeup news because
you know at the end of the week when I'm
done working I don't want to go try to
flip through all those blogs and
websites and look for those articles
like nobody does you're exhausted but I
just turn on what's up and makeup news
and I like learn something and I feel
it's important for people in the
industry to watch it to kind of know
what the heck's going on so thank you I
appreciate the horse I mean that this is
cool I'm gonna I'm really gonna try not
to like Wednesday Addams you or anything
whatever you want this is really really
fun though all right I just want to make
sure these brows do you justice okay
cool I really hope you like this and I'm
going to love it I already know I am it
might it's in my heart I know I am oh
these brows are like solid okay so this
is my favorite the Too Faced
the shadow is completely gone it is the
shadow the shadow insurance the thing
about traveling is like the the labels
just fall off even Danny won't let me do
this with the private really just it's
interesting Danny's makeup routine is
he'll use his cat Bundy foundation like
the lightest shade she has I think it's
a forty one and then he'll he'll lick
slap on these crazy lines because it's
black metal
I think it's Zazu --dl it's a glitter
Lee clown paint know what it's like
high-end clown paint from England I
could be wrong and so he likes to use
that he puts it really thick on his
eyelid and then when you put down the
red eyeshadow it just pops like it looks
amazing but yeah because of that we we
don't use primer on him and he's just
he's been in this industry so long he
says set in his ways it's interesting
like working with a man who has worn
makeup for his whole career and he's
very good like he's very artsy he's a
good drawer and he does a great job but
he he likes it when I come in and do the
contouring and his eyes so how long have
you been with the band I have been with
the band for five years now and oh my
gosh this stuff is so buttery it's it's
sometimes a little too much to work with
like you have to be careful I've never
had followed with it but as long as you
you tap it before you use it right so
what I like about this is like it looks
like a bigger butt when it goes on it's
kind of like an orange and it's kind of
vampiric um about it so nice all right
I'll get you to close your eyes here
this is gonna work out really good and
I'm using the brush I can't pronounce
dull um bdellium I think it's telling us
I don't know see I don't know if it's a
silent bdellium yeah it's the 783 I'm
actually talking like a youtuber right
now you sure are this is so funny I
never thought this would happen so I'm
like yeah go me so I know that you can
do swipes back and forth where you can
do like little circles there's so many
different techniques sometimes when I'm
on the road I am in such a rush that I'm
just like yeah oh my face covering my
eyeball it's really pretty it's just
really subtle
want to overdo it it's kind of cool
seeing a darker look on people who don't
necessarily always do darker look I like
hearing your really colorful eyes like
when you use the lime greens and stuff
I'm like ah thanks to you so while are
like the golds and stuff okay so that's
the beginning
now before right this is oh my fault
okay I'm not used to somebody doing my
makeup no I did that oh my god I'd hate
to be the person who makes you go blind
this one here I never thought I'd like
like I never liked this brush for what
is used for it's the NYX smudging brush
okay and I'm like I tried using it and
smudging it I'm like no but for packing
on powder it's it's amazing um so what I
do is I take the crystal this palette
here and I'm just gonna go along your
eyebrows here just to like make them pop
a little bit like it just literally it
puts it on flawlessly and it's it's it's
such an affordable little brush and it's
easy to clean literally one night it
rolled off the table into the back end
of like this wall at the venue and I was
just like ripping at the table losing my
mind and it was like man I want that and
they're like how much does it cost like
it's that principle all right so what I
do is I do this thing where I actually
powder it's a cool little straight stage
trick that I learned is powdering that
like inner corner of your eye first
stage it just I guess this is a form of
contouring it just kind of opens up your
eyes a little bit I also use it as kind
of a concealer because I get like really
really bad bags and that go up into that
corner if you were like doing public
speaking or something it just brightens
it up yeah it's crazy how much it helps
what I do is I bring this onto the lid I
love this shade it is like this beige
and it's I guess Gray's is that the
proper term for it I don't know my eyes
are closed I can't see it
[Laughter]
like actually goes to a person that's
okay don't worry about it okay I think
that guys do it to me on stage I'm not
concerned I've gotten like water in the
face it's fine yeah that one there it's
okay exactly it's a gray Jenna feeling I
feel like that was like that is like the
color for new goth makeup like everyone
doing the new goth is like great all the
crazy okay so something I'm gonna do cuz
your eyes are a little bit different I
knew that this was gonna happen I'm
actually gonna take a different brush
and get the bottom line there this is a
concealer brush from ELF and it's my
favorite for details is weird how I've
gotten different brushes over the years
on my travels like all over the world
and they all like have a different
purpose like then what they're actually
good to do nice
I don't know figure out what works right
yeah exactly so and again affordable
like elf and Nexus a musician like
musicians budget there we go I know I'm
gonna put liner here but you just never
want like that little you know what I
mean that little missed spot that little
hole and then again attention to detail
I'm just like brutal for it and one
thing that's like really I'm really a
stickler on now is blending because of
my friend you look from Germany she
bought me all the zoeva blending brushes
and now I'm just like blunt blood all
the time so yes it's amazing what a good
blend can do for your eye I'm trying to
work on that because I'm a lazy blender
I like to blend for about 3.5 seconds
and they're like okay I'm done in bored
9.75 max see that's the problem I will
spend like the guys go at me I will
spend like five minutes in the mirror
blending and they're like yeah I just
used my fingers and like smudged all my
black makeup over my eyes I don't know
what you're doing yeah so but it looks
so much better it does yeah it it just
brings it together it's literally art
for your eyes do you know what I mean
yeah and the guys in my band they're
really interesting all right I keep it
right
I really don't want to get you in the I
forgetting it's okay they all use like
Knicks makeup they using these big jumbo
sticks and stuff oh yeah this way a
little bit I just want to make sure I
didn't miss melts a classic it is they
love it they use it on their lips it's
so cute um and I actually I taught the
two guitarists who were to do at the
time how to do their makeup and I'm
quite proud of them because they've like
it's simple makeup but they do it really
well and efficiently and well and these
are guys that wouldn't have worn makeup
if they weren't in the band correct
exactly like it's we're one of those
acts that have like a massive image
which like I'm not a lot of bands that
like other than maybe kissed you know
right
we've got like this um this crazy image
going on and it requires so much work
and planning and love and man like doing
face charts for music videos and stuff
it's crazy it's a section really in
really really nice it's when we do the
under eye it's gonna all tie together
and it's gonna be nuts I feel and I
think a lot of people can sympathize
with me about this is like when you're a
little you are either the Disney
princess or you were the Disney
villainess and I identified with the
villain s's the most so it's like when
you're like that at a young age it just
never goes away
yeah just becomes it's part of who you
are exactly yeah that's so cool
I was definitely leaning more toward the
princess side I have to admit that's
okay it was like we need pre-season see
me do like horrible too many
villainesses no no thanks so something I
like to do and again for being on stage
I like putting white powder like just a
matte white in the corners of the eyes
um and what it does it's so cool here
have a close so I just feel maybe it's
because I like the way tiger's eyes look
I don't know what it is if you notice
that like tigers have like this this bit
of white in the corner of their eyes I
feel it just does something that makes
the whole look like open up I don't know
it and then when you'll see later when
we go to put some like highlighter on it
it just makes it pop even more and it's
like my favorite thing to do and I think
that's like one step that people are
like literally how do you do that I'm
like well so here
an open yeah okay I like what's is going
and it's like literally applied the way
I apply it to okay now I'm gonna get you
look up I'm gonna not jab you in there
maybe it'll look okay now I can follow
directions I can follow directions
you've got this view but are your
twitching a little break okay
let's start again okay yeah yeah I like
to bring it in a little bit here before
we get really heavy like I'm like
squishing it right now it's like this
big to me I don't even know what's
happening right now I'm looking forward
to how's it going I have no idea it's
going good I'm just gonna I'm all about
symmetry even though that does not
technically exist on our faces so I
don't want to let your face down we need
to make sure that everything is level do
you do that with your tutorials I've
never really I try to write sometimes it
fails are you ready I'm ready okay I'm
very ready okay this part is Lindsay
this is worried but I'm just like I
don't know if I can handle this when you
first start doing it but then the more
the more you do it and you put the rest
of the look together as when it gets
late okay okay all right so there's this
thick under-eye but it is going to come
together okay what happened uh it after
a certain amount of minutes it just it
cuts off and you have to restore it was
that what you got in your videos I
thought it was just like editing yours
editing it I do at it yeah yeah okay
yeah just to make sure so what it did is
along the the bottom here is just you
start with the first layer okay and then
you just kind of work your way towards
the bottom lashes so I just kind of
blend it a little bit to give it like a
smoke and when you're on stage it looks
like such a solid line but I don't want
it to literally be like solid on my face
okay so this is how I bring it together
so I stay close to the lash line and
then just Pat like another layer of this
darker color on the bottom like it kind
of just like layers up it's really
really cool yeah this color suits your
eye color so well it's actually kind of
crazy I think you need this clawsome I
think I do and they say just make sure
I'm getting it right
okay yeah alright and what I'll do the
other one here just never know man that
first application when you do makeup on
somebody else you're not used to that
face shape so it's different and that's
why I've people that say you know oh can
you do my makeup and it's like oh no
your face right how do you know you're
so weird I kinda don't know I do makeup
on me but someone else's faces a totally
different shape so I just really admire
like makeup artists or being able to do
anybody's face yeah that's like a skill
it's just a talent that blows my mind
like the people who've trained me and
like them going into work every day and
just making someone look so fabulous for
you know like film and and TV and models
shoots music videos anything I'm like
how you do that it's just it's just
beyond me so okay I think this is
happening this is gonna be way to the
liner goes on oh my god this is really
good I know you're gonna I think you're
really gonna like this
I just got actually pull down the shape
of one of these quickly because I've
gotten a cemetry another thing and the
other thing that is so funny I have to
say this I have to share this with the
beauty world because it's hilarious when
you're up on stage trim your nose hairs
because if you have a photographer get
up in your business and see something up
your nose oh my gosh it's forever it's
forever
like this on the internet you can't take
it away yeah your nose right your solid
oh my okay it's just like how many
musicians don't have that yeah I mean
you would think I mean especially with
the audience being below you yeah it's
weird and then that lower lip wine
always make sure that very important
yeah like when I see like lip lines on
the bottom that are all in my OCD okay
do it I can't do it let's give this a
shot
so I want to make sure I got this shape
right yeah so just like um just like
chill look at me for a second yeah I
just like look up my nose or something
all right here we go oh my gosh I only
know how to do this on myself so this is
a new experience I literally feel like
I'm painting a picture right now this is
something that
me like two minutes for myself in the
morning was with the part I think where
every woman on the planet just goes
completely silent because it's like
you're not your eyeliner makes you wear
breaks yeah and it's like you just hold
your breath and pray mm-hmm yeah I'm
afraid of the makeup gods okay exactly
we can go with a really sick look but
it's go go before it dries forever I
hope I'm not hurting you know God okay
I'm hurting you
oh my gosh oh my god job done denied she
never liked tweeted back at me ever no
worries on that okay just clean with the
I'm just cleaning it up with a bit of
powdering
I mean I've done that so many times
myself though so yeah it's that I think
I did it though I think I moved my
eyeball
it's okay once forget those lashes okay
it's not gonna be visible another thing
I cut corners quite a bit see that like
new jag herself in the corner with
mascara it's like I meant to put dots on
my upper eyelid tonight like clearly
clearly that was yeah that was so part
of the look tonight like you can just
you can yes sir metal world okay so next
part of liner that is just like it's my
favorite and my most least favorite part
is pulling the look together so what I
do is I kind of go I built like an outer
shell so to say there we go and I like
to bring it out there cuz I'm gonna
bring it down this is what I do every
night before a show sometimes you guys
will notice that my liner is like funky
Munky shaped or like like really I don't
know I can't explain it
yeah this is the Lindsey look you're
almost a getting Cleopatra right here
and easy but it looks so nice on stage
like when I put on that black gown and I
get out there and I start singing opera
it's just like yes of course you have to
have this big bold like wing like why
wouldn't you because there's been nice
room like oh think I went too bold and I
did it when the photos came in
no it was too tiny little chubby wing
and I'm like why did I imagine you do
that too bold with the kind of makeup
that you do like never you can just like
I've brought wings like all the way back
here like redrawn my eyebrow all the way
back and yeah it's crazy
okay so want to make sure this works for
you okay cuz your eye shaped a little
different than mine so you can actually
close them right now okay closing them
okay
there we go that makes more sense this
liner is Luxur really really good I'm
glad I put this on my wallet and there
I'm gonna pick some up I haven't you
know how hard when you're onto her it's
so easy to find a Sephora do you know
how far I like hearted is I find a NYX
store Oh anywhere near a venue like you
know if everyone murder us either
you don't know many link I've ever been
chose the one in San Francisco really
yeah
de su there's one in my hometown okay
but it's like a tiny one so yeah
oh man Danny must be fed up with me I've
to do this and Danny like every night
okay I'm just gonna bring it up just a
little bit more cuz this is the part
that just gives you that crazy cat eye
look like the crazy bitch cat eye it's
really really cool let's see how we're
doing how are we looking so far same
face it's like that it just keeps taking
over it's a stage persona it does that I
just want to do your face justice when
you told me about this concept last
night I was like I'm gonna ruin our
pretty funny yeah I don't know I think
it's interesting how like I look at I
see the animal in us I guess and I take
a lot of inspiration from like nature
this or something I was a set in grade
six but it's it's very true you know
when I see our makeup I feel like the
way we paint our face is kind of modeled
after like a cat or a tiger or something
and I always found that really
interesting I think there's like a
sexiness to it cat I think so they're in
control and yeah yeah
it's really really cool so I think
that's why I like people are so
attracted to their power like a lion is
like a very powerful animal and okay
look at me
that's awesome oh my god I'm really
happy with this I can stop freaking out
you can come over then I can see right
now cuz I can't see anything
we obviously some of the detail people
put into their makeup on YouTube it's
incredible and some of the Instagram
stuff Oh
but the thing bothers me about Instagram
is you never know what's photoshopped on
and what they really do my gosh that
bothers me that's like I wanted to know
what they actually did I mean there's
nothing I have an artistic photo that's
been enhanced as long as I like I don't
know what's real and what's not real
yeah okay so contouring so I'm not a
mater I'm not like drag contr this is
like you know this might go too but like
I'm not like gonna do everything I call
I just like having those cheeks nice you
know and you know honestly I am so
guilty like I'm in this grim black metal
s band and there are so many photos of
me smiling here you put your your chin
down I'm smiling on stage and people are
like you're like the happiest person in
heavy metal I'm like yes I have fun on
stage it's really fun but when you know
when you when you smile it looks really
good when your cheeks are that popping
up so what I do is I just do a very
light contour I start from the back here
and I do it in this circular motion I
don't remember where I learned this from
probably Geordi from it's likely makeup
i watch a lot of her tutorials
she's very informative I've never
swirled my contour like that but it
makes sense yeah as long as like it
doesn't end up going too low I think
that I would make a mistake and it would
end up going like beardface oh no I've
never had that problem I was I've done
beard face until actually a subscriber
told me I was doing beard face and I
realize you're right I kind of am doing
beard face I should probably stop doing
this heartbreaking yeah but I mean I was
thankful for the constructive criticism
because it helped me up my contour game
right so what the hell that's that
exactly that that feedback like that's
the thing people have told me actually I
started contouring
almost three years ago and it was bad I
just like took my thumb Leimert and it
looked like I literally had like a shark
fin on my face and it was just
depressing it's not blended and then my
friend bought me this brush she's like
oh hell no honey you just think you
can't be doing this know something I
like to do that I like to bring it up so
there's no beard going on and then
another thing I like to do because we
want everything to be super light is I
actually took the powder and I pressed
it in the crease there and then I blend
it around kind of like you would treat
blush I think I'm still trying to get
the hang of blush like when you do dark
makeup the last thing you want is blush
why do you want to look alive when
you're trying to look dead blush is like
a new thing for me like I find learning
makeup in layers is the most important
thing you can do start with this one
thing incorporate it into your routine
get as good at it is you you know you
feel you can and then learn a new thing
I think yeah people have a hard time in
the world of makeup they're like I can
never do it it's like yeah because
you're trying to learn like everything
all at once right and that's what's just
gonna drive you mental it's that's why
people get overwhelmed when they take on
new things in life because they just
want to do it all and it's like no you
got to do it in steps and that's luckily
cradle has been very patient with me and
they've dealt with my bad makeup the
first years of the band now it's finally
going somewhere so I use this big fluffy
unicorn brush and just take away some
follow I see on your face this is why I
love having like a big fluffy brush so
have you get makeup to stay on onstage
that's all the settings for getting
spraying my best friend yeah the the Kat
Von D stuff of course this is what I get
for getting a care package from Kat Von
D I guess yes all of her stuff it's
crazy so I'm gonna blend this a little
more so you don't have well you won't
have the beard but I don't want you have
like a weird chunk I'm also guilty for
that my god here's my big crazy weird
chunk of contour but it's again it's a
process you can always get better this
is my favorite part this is the part
that like is my trick and this is just
so silky and it's not over glittery and
that's what I really love about this
palette so just you get this little bit
of like sparkle onstage and it's so
pretty I'm sure with the lights shining
it's just it's so cool like I'm about
really colorful makeup I think I've been
told by the guys are like you're the
most colorful goth I've ever met I'm
like I know I'm like we can make color a
dark thing guys like we don't have to
just stick to black and white and gray
all the time I know that some people do
that like literally all they do is like
like especially with the new goth friend
they just do this black and white with
like grey and a hint of red the light
hair just turned this way because the
lights really oh yeah you are so sparkly
sparkly very Maleficent right now I love
it I took this and I take the a little
bit because I don't want to overdo it I
take a little bit and I just put it like
on the brow bone a little bit it's
really fun so this is like this is like
the look that I go to when I'm just like
you know what I know it I've got it down
pat we're gonna make it happen and also
if you could look up I'm gonna put it oh
boy
I'm so scared I'm gonna get like all
this all over your face right now I'm
really trying not to it's like it's cool
how it transforms over blacks and look
up and Browns it's really really neat
but I was like an inner eye thing like I
don't know it's just it's so cool
quickly bring this bad boy up so it's
like oh yeah this is really cool alright
and then we're gonna let you do the the
lashes and lipstick and you're gonna
have the full Lindsey Schoolcraft look
yes but you're gonna pick the lipstick
for me I am yeah I'm gonna tell me which
lipstick it is - I bought it like three
times okay I love this one and I have a
brand-new lip brush that I haven't used
yet that is perfectly clean let's do I
can do that alright so we're gonna do
lashes lipstick be right back for the
big reveal
oh how do I look
I feel like that it's all like came
together with the lips I ended up
putting the milk makeup holographic lip
gloss over it because my skills did not
live up to the dark Kat Von D lipstick
it was like bleeding everywhere and then
I tried the lip liner and it wasn't
working and then I I just threw the
gloss on top help me kind of even it out
a little
but I like the way that it looks with
like a little bit of an iridescent
yeah definitely yeah I get that
sometimes on stage I'll do like a purple
nice nice and I I just I feel like a
goth princess right now I do I still
feel like me but also a little bit gone
it's seeping into my soul right now so
one step I totally missed was the
blotting powder but I didn't want to
make you look like super-dead couldn't
your skin color does not need to go like
this like stage makeup right I put this
on usually before the highlighter and
this is a step that is so important and
cousin oily dry skin I'll do it again
before I go on stage right okay just to
make sure that it all together it's me
and Danny's favorite so my Kat Von D for
making this good it just works for our
lives so well so cool well thank you
