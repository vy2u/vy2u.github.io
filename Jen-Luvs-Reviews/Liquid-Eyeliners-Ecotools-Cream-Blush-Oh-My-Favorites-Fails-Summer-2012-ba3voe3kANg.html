opportunity because my kids are both
sleeping my husband is still at work so
that means i can make a video woohoo I'm
wanna shoot this video for a really long
time because i have bought so many
products this summer then i want to
share with you some of them were awesome
some of them were not awesome so I
wanted to tell you about them so that
you would know before you bought so here
we go first off I have been very
obsessed with colored eyeliner this
summer I don't know what it is but I
guess it's because I get scared of color
all over my I like I don't people to go
look oh my gosh she's wearing blue eye
shadow let me show you kind of would
have been doing I've been doing like a
like a new die with a colored eyeliner
and I've got purple and then I do a
little bit of purple on the bottom or
sometimes like I'll do blue on the top
and purple on the bottom or switch them
or do pink on the top and blue on the
bottom you know just kind of like spice
it up a little bit with like a new dish
kind of I ok first I got these two elf
ones and they're pretty good they're a
little bit thick they're a little clumpy
know if you can see that but they're a
little thick a little clumpy but they
work fine I would definitely say for the
price they're totally worth it this
brown is much better than the gold we
swatch it for you see that's actually
pretty nice if you can see that but
that's actually pretty nice let me
swatch the gold for you and of course
the gold is not is sheer it's going to
go over top but they go on really really
nicely oh by the way go to walmart if
you're going to go to drugstore because
i returned some things they didn't even
have the package and they still took it
back unlike other places that are really
anal about taking things back so just so
you know yay for walmart i don't really
like
art I'm a target girl but I was really
impressed with that other drug store
well cheaper I liners that I really love
are these two from NYX love these I'm
like in love with these I'm wearing the
purple right now and I love this blue
love it love it love it highly recommend
knows this one is from Milani it's their
green eternal i think is what it's
called so it says in the bond but look
at that look at I don't know if you can
see that but it's like got like a little
mushy line this one is really kind of
ugly too like hard to apply like it gets
a little sticky but it dries really nice
if you can bear with it it's a little
claw p to put on you just have to kind
of be careful and gentle with it and
it'll end up being fine and it's really
pretty like it's real shimmery so a
shimmery green I've worked an see isn't
this is the thing I go into sephora and
I have to get something like I can't I
can't handle it it's like this
addictions thing inside of me is like
buy something oh oh my goodness it's the
new pink eyeliner from urban decay I
have to get it so i got it i think it's
called wisteria i wasn't as happy with
as i thought it would be I have to admit
um it is really nice it's I don't like
the brush as much as the black let me
see if I can swatch it in a different
spot so you can see it better I don't
like though it as much as the black for
the simple reason that when you put it
or wine by itself it looks a little
creepy like it looks a little almost
bloody i don't know like it just doesn't
look right it doesn't look nice and he
may be someone with lighter hair it
would look good but with my darker hair
it just looks really weird I've really
liked skin maybe if you have dark really
dark skin or like a chocolatey skin it
would look really nice but it doesn't
look like some me so what I have to do
cuz I do like it I do wear it because I
spent like 19 bucks on it so I better
wear it and I was so excited about it so
what I do is I put the pink on like a
little bit thicker and then I put a tiny
bit of black liquid eyeliner like right
by my lashes and it really balanced it
balances out nicely like it makes it not
look creepy it looks actually really
cool
and then then what I do is I put this
this um it's called distortion this is
urban decay tease because of course I go
into my one thing I end up buying two
things and you know anything that
happens but I love this one this one is
beautiful and I put this up with this
over top of the pink I don't know if
you'll be able to see it but it's like
really it's iridescent glitter oh it's
pretty it's so pretty I wear it all the
time I wear it in the daytime I don't
follow those rules about heavier makeup
in the daytime later make up a nightmare
I wear whatever I just wear what I think
looks good so I'll wear this glittering
during the daytime it doesn't even
matter i guess it's summertime so you
can kind of glitter it up a little bit
if you want so that's it for eyeliners
that I got I really my favs oh wait
there's one more this one I got at Sally
it's by thin couture because they have
to make it sound really fancy and it's
this black it's really gloppy you really
have to wear it over look at this look
how gross looking that is but I kept it
because it can when you swatch for you
look see how it's like it's not it's
black but it's not quite black like you
have to wear it over a black eyeliner
because if you don't wear it over black
I learn it looks absolutely ridiculous
it looks like you just didn't know what
you were doing it looks terrible so I
mean it is nice and its got like a
ringing Bowie kind of glitter I don't
know if you can see that or not but it's
got like rainbow me kind of glitter in
it and it is pretty and it does come off
a little bit easier than some of the
other ones i noticed so i guess you get
what you pay for but i don't know but i
like the next one's the next ones i know
i like the next one so much they love
the Urban Decay one sorry for that
clinking that was the stuff on the table
ok so rewind sides eyeliner ok so a
couple other things ah love doesn't
though the move love to love these these
are my support cream blushes love these
especially this one this one is in Rose
glow love this one it's definitely the
only blush i use pretty much now this
one I like this one is called blush
creme
no that doesn't even make any sense
coral flush coral flush and this is role
at Rose glow this is coral flesh the
reason why don't use this much as much
as cuz it does have a shimmer in it and
I think that looks a little weird
sometimes especially when I'm really
pale which I'm getting paler because I
haven't been out in the Sun that much
and I'll tell you another reason why I'm
getting paler no sorry and then I wasn't
as impressed with which I'm sad to say
is my Laura Mercier mascara full-blown
volume mascara and black I'm sad about
this because I really wimpy eyelashes
and it doesn't help me very much this
might be nice and somebody that has
naturally long lashes might be good
because it definitely doesn't clump it's
it's it's makes them it separates their
lashes really nicely but it doesn't
really lengthen my lashes very well
there's the blonde for it so I'm a
little disappointed that one okay this
elf translucent mattifying powder I used
it for a little while and then I
realized was making the look like a doll
like it was too mattifying like it look
made me look kind of fake I have it on
now because I get really shiny when i'm
using my camera so i did put it on now
tonight shrine so much i'm seeing that I
do have my blush on you live my blush
that's the the Rose one yeah I hate it
when people look at themselves like this
and a camera and they're all like like
hello everyone you know looking at
themselves so sorry when I do that but
I'm checking my cheek sell this one
milani as well milani girls love pink um
in a pink just so you know it's not pink
its an eye shadow that's not pink it's
glittery it's glitter it's straight
glitter no pigmentation at all is your
pigmentation um but it adds a nice
glitter so if you want a glitter it
works now the last thing I want to tell
you that I've just been loving this
month and i bought this before but these
brushes I ecotools their eye shadow
brushes now I saw some youtube reviews
on these and people said that they were
kind of weird which they are but i love
them i absolutely love them they are my
only brushes I use now even my brush
that came in my naked 2 palette I don't
even use that anymore really I you just
use these this one is huge look how big
this is look how big that is gigantic
but it's really nice to just quickly go
lid lately
they lid done your lids done i also have
been doing it like over here to kind of
really get that outer corner like if i'm
doing one color in the outer corner bar
now and it's done then i use I use them
for the purposes they say to use them um
this is my crease one and I'm go
bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh done which is
nice highlighter brow bone doo-doo-doo
perfect now these I don't use quite as
much but these are nice these are tiny
little brushes teeny tiny little brushes
but those are really nice to add a
little extra darkening in the corner
there so you got a flat one on a round
one this one's also good for down here
right there so I have an angled one that
I usually use for that though but if I
didn't have my angled when I use this
one more but yeah I love these ecotools
brushes i was so impressed with these
that I don't have anything they're not
like any other brushes that people
recommend that's one of the reasons why
i like them i was so surprised that I
like them so much so um oh the last
thing I want to tell you and I left in
the other room I don't feel like getting
it well okay I'll go get it I'll get a
robotic obray back okay so this is what
I want to show you so i got this to face
tanning bed into with overall i really
liked it don't expect dramatic results
ain't gonna give it to you but if you
want a little healthy khlo it is really
nice unfortunately it isn't the exact
color that I would normally tan too i'm
kind of olive skinned and it makes more
of like a reddish Rosie kind of tannish
kind of color I'm not orange it looks
that looks natural it's just not my
natural we just fine nobody else knows
the difference and I've gotten a lot of
compliments on it I am running out so
i've been using it sparingly so I'm
getting a little paler but I just I have
another one coming in the mail soon
because I wanted to reup for the rest of
the summer so but yeah overall would
recommend but don't expect like crazy
results from if you want to dark tan me
and get with us and it just think going
to happen thank you so much for watching
let me know in the comments if you've
used any of these products before if you
have any recommendations for me of
products that you've used this summer
that you love let me know hope you all
are doing good and I will see
