hello my friends I am back with more
stuff from so excited I if you don't
know yet you will know now how much I
love a little black bag I am having so
much fun with this stinking web site I
cannot get off of it like seriously like
I am constantly checking to see what is
in the gallery so I know what is coming
up so and I'm waiting until January
first and be wary first so that I can
order with stuff I'm so excited okay so
if you don't know what little black bag
is it is a subscription service but you
don't have to do it every month you can
do 4999 or 2999 whichever one you want
or you can skip them up if you want more
information go to little black bag calm
there will be a link down below this
month I decided to do the 2999 bag
because I'd never done that one before
and I didn't really want a bag this time
i looked at the gallery wasn't crazy
about any of the bags wasn't like oh my
god you must have it so i decided to
just do jewelry this time because there
was a lot of jewelry that i liked um so
i will show you what I got um I will
start off with the jewelry item that I
picked for my main I don't want you go
on you pick a main item that you
absolutely want the main item that I got
which I am in love with is the
Florentine Knights necklace and this is
what it looks like I'm going to go ahead
and put that on for you i'm also going
to have image there so you can see it up
close and this is my spring street and i
absolutely love this necklace the beads
are kind of big I haven't lost any of
the rhinestones yet which is nice that's
always a positive thing these almost
look like a football kind of shape my
only thing if you are not into the fake
gold looking gold you probably won't
like this but I I really like it and
with the necklace it came with this
cutesy little spring street bag which i
think is adorable love that i don't know
i'm gonna do it yet but it was free and
free stuff is always good also from
Spring Street I got a ring and when
cut this little box I was like what in
the world did I get them come in a
little box and I forgot about this ring
that I got this is called the vintage
plume feather ring which makes it sound
very fancy this also has little diamond
d diamonds on their horse fake of course
and my only complaint about this ring is
it is quite small it does fit on my ring
finger it is a little bit tight on this
finger I think my ring finger is a six
ish so if you're any bigger than that i
would not recommend buying this or if
you're any significantly smaller than
that i wouldn't recommend buying it i
can't fit it on my pointer finger I
don't know my ring sizes but not big so
definitely be careful of that if you
were planning on ordering this ring
that's kind of how that looks on and I
think it's really pretty this is the
only thing that I ordered that I don't
think I would have bought if I saw it in
a store but since I own it i will
definitely be wearing it and i do think
it is really pretty i saw on a little
black bag haul video these threader
earrings and I absolutely fell in love
with them I was like I must have a pair
of threader earrings at the end of this
bag and I ended up with two pairs of
threader earrings at the end of the
staff which I was so excited about so
I'll show you the first parent these are
the silver silver single curved wire
with bowl threader earrings and i'll
show you how these go in so you've got
this little sticky thing and you stick
it in your ear like that and ends up
looking like that and i adore these i
think they are so stinking cute and i
love that these could be dressy or
casual however i want to play it are the
other ones that I got rose gold double
curved wire threader earring I can't do
it without reading it sure about that
and this is how they look straight out
there bent and that's how they look
hanging and I'm going to show you how
that goes in you stick one whole piece I
know this is kind of creepy it was
creepy for me at first too but it looks
so stinking cute you put it through your
ear like that and pull it out the other
side like I I love these earrings so
much that when I got them I wore them to
bed because I didn't want to take them
out that's pretty sick like
if you're wearing big dangly earrings to
bed you must be absolutely in love with
them and I am in love with these
earrings I think they're so so super
cute and they're rose gold and I love
rose gold I think is so so stinking
pretty so super happy with that so those
are the four items that I got in my
little black bag this time no bad just
four pieces of jewelry so excited about
on what I got all right I just want to
give a huge thank you to Carolyn see you

little black bag and I just want to
thank you so much because you helped me
to get the items that I got so thank you

thank you to Emma Rodriguez who is
amazing she went out of her way to make
sure that her credit went through for me
so I really really appreciate that Emmy
thank you so much I unfortunately had
already opened my bag when your credit
went through so i'll be using it next
time so i'll get to show you next time
what i use with your credit so thank you
um if you want to open up your own
little black bag I will put my link
below but please don't feel obligated to
use it you can just go to little black
bag calm and you can open up your bag
from there but if you feel like getting
me a free item I will definitely not
complain about that stuff but a link
down below in case you want to use my
link to open up your own I personally
love little black bag I think it's
totally worth it twenty-nine ninety-nine
bag is really hard to get a bag and
actual person left something really
small but if you want a really cute bag
