put this in one video but I think I want
to split up into two videos I just got
my little black bag shipment right yeah
I got a little little black bag box this
time and I wanted to show you the things
that I got this month my next video
which is gonna be coming out in a day or
two is gonna be my tips and tricks on
trading on little black bag because I
really feel like there aren't enough
videos out there for little black bag
and how to trade and experiences with
trading so make sure that you hit the
subscribe button so that you don't miss
that next video in case you don't know
little black bag is a subscription
service but you don't have to do it
every single month it is either $50 4999
or 2999 depending on how many items you
get you can go to the website for more
details plus it's like five bucks
shipping and what you do is you pick out
a bag or whatever item to be your main
item and then they throw in other items
in there and then you have seven days to
trade out your stuff so like for
december i got my bag plus a 2 or 3
jewelry items and five different samples
to trade you don't know with the jewelry
items what you're gonna get until you
hit the checkout button and that's where
trading comes in because you don't like
what you get which I did not like what I
got I traded for other things and ended
up much much happier with my purchases
so i'll show you what i ended up getting
i'll say my bag this is the bag that I
got it is a steve madden bag and there's
a little stegeman um and it is very thin
but that's fine with me i'm good with
that it's got the like little Chevron II
kind of print up there zipper in the
back and I really like it i think it's
cute um it's got two pockets in the
front two little pockets there a cell
phone pocket whatever um and it's called
an envelope bag I think it's a little
thin I didn't expect it to be this
envelope II um but I think with the
right outfit this is going to be really
super cute these earrings I got for my
friend Mary Lynn got these for her
because she's really into like the
Native America
kind of jewelry and I also got these for
her but I don't think I'm gonna give
them to her because she doesn't like
things that are fake and these look
faker than I thought they would and as I
was trading for them i almost got rid of
them because i knew that they were
probably gonna look pretty fake these
might go back I think they probably will
because I don't think Marilyn's don't
like these and I'm not a big fan of them
either I also got this bracelet and I
thought this was really cute very
industrial looking really nice with a
pair of black black jeans and a t-shirt
kind of situation all I have are very um
like dressy like work kind of bracelet
so this will be nice for like a casual
t-shirt kind of day then I got this
necklace that i absolutely love see how
small this is I expected this to be a
lot bigger it's supposed to be like a
flower petal like flower petals and I
really like this a lot it's very dainty
and I expect it to be a little more
obnoxious than it is it is silver I'm
very very very happy with this and this
is bye-bye georgeanna which is known to
be a pretty nice brand and then I got
samples I got to love vanilla samples
and they're just regular standard side
they're cute little boxes they're kind
of deceiving because they look like
they're going to be bigger samples than
they are but they're just little sample
vials actually they're probably big
they're bigger than store samples and I
got both the pure vanilla and the wild
um I'm sorry the vanilla blackberry one
the pure vanilla one is um it smells
like a candle smells like a vanilla
candle with a little bit of an alcoholic
fragrance II smell and this one the
vanilla blackberry to me smells exactly
like a bottle of red wine so I don't
know what whether I'm gonna wear these
are not I don't know we'll see I like
this one better than this one because
this one just and it doesn't smell like
a perfume to me it smells like I
drenched myself in in alcohol and that's
probably not the best thing to wear to
work especially working with young
children alright and then the last thing
I got which I'm really excited to try is
the rock aholic TG dirty secret dry
shampoo actually paid extra to add this
to my bag I think it was like three
dollars to add this my bag so I'm
excited to try that and they also threw
in surprisingly on this you be
moisturizing skin cream just randomly um
problem dry skin split cuticles cracked
chapped lips hard heels eczema and
sunburned so I'm sure that will be put
to use
somewhere so overall I'm very happy with
my little black bag this time um i think
i am gonna send that one pair of
earrings back I don't know see this is
the thing I feel like that if I saw this
stuff in the store I might not
necessarily buy it and that's kind of
where I am with little black bag right
now that I don't want to start doing a
little black bag and then ending up with
a bunch of stuff that I never would have
bought if I saw in the store so I'm
going to be a little more careful about
when I open a bag with little black bag
and making sure that I like a lot of
stuff on the site before I open a bag
and not just get my heart set on a few
items and then not ending up with them
you can spend money to purchase items
extra it's just not worth it to do that
for me i mean i think i will enjoy the
things that i got but i think i gave in
to the gimmick a little bit i became
quite a consumer on little black bag
this time and didn't really get like
hardcore things that i would have bought
if I saw him in a store mad love and I
will see you in the next video which is
going to be my tips and tricks on little
black bag on what I've learned from that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
