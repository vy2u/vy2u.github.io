black bag is not has it been quite the
rage that it once was but I know that a
lot of you are still using little black
bag because I stick you guys opening
your boxes because opening your bags I
get notifications when people that i'm
subscribed to you on there open up a
little black bag so i see a lot of you
so getting them so i wanted to show you
what I got just in case you're still
interested if you've never heard a
little black bag little black bag is a
jewelry purse makeup this is how socks
sometimes I mean all kind of house where
the candles jewelry holders they have
all kinds of crazy stuff on there and
basically what you do is you pick an
item that you want to open your bag with
and then they give you some additional
items to go along with it and then you
have seven days to trade your items with
other users to get to what you want your
bag to end up as trading has been a
little bit difficult lately the quality
of the products hasn't been is amazing
so I can see why a lot of people haven't
been doing it as much lately but I did
decide to open a bag so I want to show
you what I got but yeah it's really fun
when there's people on their trading if
you can catch it on a sale like
sometimes they'll have like they had
half off boots or they'll have you know
open up with fifty dollars or more and
get a free bag you know like things like
that will really drive you know people
to the website and that's when you
really want to open a bag up when
there's a lot of people you know when
they offer a deal so I don't think there
was anything amazing i think i just saw
bag i really liked and then I ended up
trading my back because my husband said
he didn't really like it so I end up
treating it and I'm still not even sure
if I'm gonna like the value that I got
so let me show you what i did get which
just jump into it i'm gonna show you the
back first because that's what's right
one top thing is ginormous I don't know
about this bag you're gonna have to tell
me what you think alright so this is
what it looks like I really needed a
brown bag I'm really didn't need a
silver bag
and somehow I ended with silver bag I
mean I guess it's kind of brownish it's
like pewter but I mean it's cute it's
got like a little like you know the
little studs on here that are like
really in trend right now and it is by a
company called let eek which I don't own
anything by and it's got the handle here
and then I believe it this extends into
a longer shoulder strap if you want it
to yeah um yeah it's got adjustable
strap here in case you want to do that
and then the zipper in the top I love
when there's a zipper in the top it
makes me happy this is actually cuter
than I thought it was gonna be so I get
for listening my husband I get all
paranoid when my husband is like Alan I
really like that it kind of looked like
a fortune cookie this bag that I
originally opened with show you and take
off all de oro stuffing and stuffing and
stuffing and show you what the inside
looks like on what that is it's very
soft inside it's not crunchy some of
these bags are really crunchy on the
outside it's very soft it seems to be a
very high quality two pockets on the
side and then zipper in the back the
zippers seem to be a very high quality
very excited about that I'm glad I ended
up getting this back no I was a little
scared what do you all think do you
think it's cute you think it's ugly be
honest with me don't let me carry around
an ugly bag please okay i'll show you
the other things that i got i ended up
adding one thing to my bag i'll put the
full cost of my bag here so you can know
how much I paid for everything I'll show
you they were having nicks on there so I
got to nicks I shadows these are the
cream eyeshadows and this one was really
popular this cream-colored one and I had
it my bag and I traded it out and I got
it again show you what that looks like
actually i'll show you swatches of both
of them I won't waste your time guys got
stuff to do today I'm sure all right
hold on so here are the two swatches of
these two nics eyeshadows this one I
will probably use this one i don't know
if i will use it's very very dark so i
don't know i don't know what I'm gonna
do with these I will probably use them I
don't know why do you have any
suggestions make my makeup friends of
how to use this dark gray one the color
on this one is gunmetal and the color on
this one is suede
and I would definitely describe this as
more of a suede than I like a tani
peachy color it's like a golden a golden
bronze II kind of color but I'll
definitely use that one we shall see let
me show you the other things that I got
I got three jewelry items I got two
bracelets and a necklace with a pair of
earrings and this one does not seem to
be a very high quality it seems very
thin very bendable ok so that's what
that looks like lon I don't know it was
seems kind of cheap I wish I kept the
necklace that I had I had a necklace
that had a monogram that said love on it
which was really cute and I should have
kept it but again I listened to my
husband he said he wasn't crazy about it
and they ended up with this so I don't
know it just seems really cheaply made
all the stones are in it just I don't
know like the way it lines up and
everything I don't know and then here
this is a love bracelet because of love
on it I really loved this on the website
this is by Lydell and I know they sell
this at nordstrom this brands if you can
see that I'll put it on opens up in the
front it's very small so if you have big
risk this is not the bracelet for you
holy moly I have tiny wrist and I'm
having trouble getting it on ok alright
so that's what that looks like so I
really like that especially with my
channel being Jen loves reviews get a
little love going on there so very happy
about this one and I know some of you
recognize the summer little black bag
friends recognize this necklace I know
one of you has this I forget who it is
who has this someone of you all has this
and always comes oh it's snow leets know
something so something with an L I can
picture your face snow li li SI leap I'm
sorry I'm butchering it but snow
something I know she has this and her as
the gold roped off of it but anyway back
to this one I like it I don't think I'm
gonna be able to get it off I have to
leave it on it's on there forever it's
stuck and then the last thing was my add
to bag and it is this necklace here very
tiny I thought it was going to be bigger
than this I guess not I guess I kind of
knew it was gonna be small so that's
really cute and dainty really like that
very pretty so overall very happy with
very thin chain um you know not not
super high quality but I kind of
expected that with this I saw the
picture of it and I think it's pretty
representative so it also came with
these little stud earrings i'll zoom
those into Wow come on so those are the
little stud earrings that it came with
just basic diamond d looking studs okay
so that's how those look they're just
basic but overall I am happy with my bag
I am a lot happier with my actual bag
than I thought I was going to be really
like the love bracelet not really sure
about this one it just seems very
cheaply made excited about this NYX
eyeshadow the one that's in suede not as
excited about the one in gunmetal and
really like the necklace here with the
moon on it that i ordered separate and
then of course you know really happy
whoo really happy about the bag so i
