I like oh my goodness so excited thank
you to any my girl used your credit this
month you rock now I get to show you
what I got using you credit because enel
any signed up for a bag using my link so
thanks to her I got an item worth I
think this was like $23 something like
that okay so let's get right into the
bag on what I got you may know from my
other little black bag videos that I am
obsessed with threader earrings they're
earrings that go like through your ear
and down the back so that you get like a
back little thingy and a front little
thing and i love them i think they're so
stinkin cute I didn't end up with one
thing our Frederick's oh no I got two
pairs of threader earrings okay so let
me show them to you I got a silver pair
and a gold pair I read off the little
receipt thing okay this one is gold
chain drop threader earrings with
pinwheel and these are free who thereby
I don't even know i will put all the
information down below of exactly who
they're by and all that stuff but this
is how they are they look like this and
then they're like that on the back and
you take them and you stick them in your
luck news and then you pull it through
the back loop and you got your little
pinwheel there and you got a little
stringy thing you there put the other
one in what okay so overall I really
really let these earrings I think
they're super cute they seem like
they're good quality a thing that seem
like they're gonna stay together the
only thing i don't like about these that
i saw that i thought these were like but
they're not is there's once on there
they're like little hearts and other
little shapes that you can kind of bring
down a little bit and make them a little
longer in the front these you can't do
that with they have to be flush or else
it looks really really weird so yeah i
do like them I'd have worn them and I do
enjoy them but I don't like them as much
as some of the other throat earrings
that are on there
i'm going to show you the other pair of
threader earrings that i got and again i
like these but i definitely like other
ones better i'm going to have to open up
some other little black bag so i can
really get the ones that I like so these
are calm me silver zigzag threader
earrings and that is exactly what these
things are look they're like little
Ziggy's Aggies like that huh and I
thought they might be hard to get in but
they're not would you put it I know this
is creepy the other ones are creepy to
put it all the way in and then like that
now i do like these two these are a
little more casual casual they do look a
little bit to me like bent paper clips
so I'm not the biggest fan of that but I
again I have one them I do enjoy them
but not really my favorite jewelry that
I've ever gotten from little black bag
okay so just a little little heads-up if
you are on little black bag and you've
seen these earrings these are the
threader earrings I showed last time
something i don't know you've seen these
they come in silver and they come in
gold just a little heads up the first
time I wear these I lost one it just
popped right out of my ear because there
is no back it doesn't go through like
these how they've got the weight on both
sides there's weight only on one side it
pulls it down and I lost one and I'm so
upset because I really love these so if
you do get these make sure you push a
back up from another earring so that you
don't lose them because I was super
super sad like I was it was the first
time I wore them and I think about them
all the time and I only have 10 and i'll
show you the two bags that i got because
i got two bags yes I did nobody wanted
to trade this one like I got this one I
was so so excited to get it and then
ever I nobody was really offering to
trade with it and I'm like why it's
super cute and i love it and it's this
cute little one and it's by a company
called mystique and i'll put all the
retail prices and everything down below
but yeah this is so stinking cute it
looks almost like um like an asian kind
of feel to me and i saw a video
somewhere for someone said it smelled
then um if you put your nose on it it
just smells like a store to me like i
don't know i don't think it smells bad
doesn't have a strong smell but maybe
it's just their smell bad or mind your
smells fine I don't know but this is how
it opens up its hard and it opens up
like that show you the inside one thing
that it says on here it says on this
product has been designed and crafted
with the utmost care and attention to
detail but I don't know if you can see
in there the little utmost attention to
detail but the little plaque in there is
crooked as crooked that is not the
utmost attention to detail my friends at
masti just so you know you might want to
make a plaque straight but I do really
like this bag other than the crooked a
little plaque in their little name it's
got this big long chain so you can wear
it as a crossbody or you can wear it you
know just straight down and I really
like this bag I am really looking
forward to date night with my husband so
that I can wear this bad now for the bag
that I fell in love with and the reason
why I open my bag a few days early
because I opened it probably the end the
last couple days in January and it is oh
my friends let me show you the
gorgeousness that is my bag that
everybody wanted and I did was like no
you cannot have my bag and it actually I
think they just came back on little
black bag but it is the parish shopper
and pink I'm seeing these bright bright
colored bags in all the stores they have
bright blues and bright pinks and break
yellows and bright oranges they're
everywhere in the stores right now and i
love this bad i haven't carried yet
because i wanted to keep the tags on
until I got to show you but this bag is
by penny sue and um suggested retail
price is eighty-nine dollars and
remember my friends all of this cost me
fifty five dollars including shipping
umm amazing it's got look it's a
leathery soft leathery kind of feel I'm
sure it's fake but soft leather you kind
of feel oh thanks let me show you what
it looks like on the inside so when you
open it up it's got the little the
little magnetic closure snappy thing in
here you open it up and it's got like
this that kind of pinches it closed I
guess just for looks and then what you
can unpin CH that and it just kind of
opens it up a little bit and you've got
this leopard print i'm not a big
print fan but I think looks really cute
in this bag got your little zipper here
got on this side you got two pockets yep
two pockets there and then on the back
you have another little zipper little
handy dandy zipper there with the little
seam um leopard print in there so now
that I've shown you I can use it and
also it really hasn't been seasoned
appropriate now that it's March I it
sees it a little more seasoned
appropriate because it's getting closer
to spring so i can carry this bag now on
warm days and i'm so excited so excited
they also have this on the website in
white black and a bright blue so if you
do like this go on a little black bag
and see if they have any available right
now if they don't have them now they
might have in the future so keep your
eye out so I I went a little nuts and I
got another bag is actually shipping now
it's not really a bag it's a nume
curling wands that I ordered because my
hair doesn't hold a curl to save its
life so I got a new curling wand it's
coming and a couple of jewelry items
that are coming with it a necklace and a
pair of another pair threader earrings
that my friend Kirsti got me oh thank
