box in the mail and I had to share it
with you the kids are up you can hear
Barney in the background all of that
good stuff hopefully my son leaves the
camera alone while I'm trying to film
this cuz they're usually sleep when I
film but I got oh my first little black
bag shipment so I can't wait to open
this and I wanted to open it on camera
what are you doing John little black bag
works you spend you spend fifty five
dollars and you pick out your back okay
then they give you two jewelry items and
some sample II kind of stuff nail polish
lip gloss face cream stuff like that and
then you can trade you have seven days
to trade your stuff out so you can trade
your bag you can trade your jewelry you
can trade your lip gloss whatever your
samples you spend seven days kind of
making your like ultimate like they call
it your back when it's your bad or plus
your jewelry question yeah whatever you
want them um whatever you end a fine I
pick up this one silver bag but i
absolutely love everybody want to travel
me and I'm like no yeah you may not have
my back you cannot have it I want that
bad no one you have it show like a day
before my bag was over you have the
seven days to trade I get an email it
says hey we accidentally what's up yeah
yeah oh you want play game okay a good
day before my bag was about to be closed
they said hey we accidentally sold to
like let people choose to many of these
bags were out of them you gotta pick
someone else I'm like what this is the
only bag I really want a little
frustrated got another email from the
company that said basically they
apologize that their server crashed
right on none what hey go ahead okay see
you later so their server crashed on on
Thanksgiving II i'm not sure what they
ended up sending me because i gave them
some options for bags and jewelry and
different things because the bag that i
had was worth like 90 bucks and I the
bat other bags that I picked out were
worth less so I'm not even sure what I'm
gonna get it's probably the only time I
do live out that black bag and have no
idea what I'm getting so I'm super
excited to open
and I cannot wait and I've touched this
and it feels like they might have sent
me my original bag which would be
amazing because it was my favorite so
this is how it comes as some people
didn't do this end up with like four
hundred dollars worth of stuff through
trading like it's amazing I didn't do
that I don't know how much money I'm not
sure how much my cost but ok so the
first thing I'm seeing is this be fine
um night clean with cocoa millet and
rice bran sounds like you could eat it
the next thing I got was a Michael
Marcus nail polish which supposedly are
very very good I'll show you what that
looks like and this is full size and it
is bright red I thought that would be
nice for the holidays oh wow that's
pretty look how beautiful that is I am
so happy with that love it ok the next
thing I'm seeing are these earrings that
I got and I do not like these at all I
don't know what in the world these
things are huge and I did not expect
that I guess it's supposed to be like
that brushed metal finish um in there
and it is not my style at all so i will
be returning these for a credit for my
next bag John gee whiz he's more excited
about this than I am so this is the
other necklace that I got I hope this is
as cute as it was on the website we will
see if not I'll just take mom sent it
back ok so it's got this the bottom I do
really like this I'm definitely keeping
this I expected I didn't expect this to
be as long and put it on and say I just
got a bunch of long sweater so this will
be nice like that ok I'm keeping this I
think this is cute no no you can see
what he's doing he's like smelling it or
something I don't even know easily now
tube bag and I think it is the bag that
I really want it I think if I complain
it I don't want any other bag yeah look
how cute this is oh my gosh it's so
excited by bally bag studio they did say
that it was ninety dollars as the mean
crisis that's cool look at the clasp on
it you can like lock it closed I like
that and then you turn it
that it matches up almost like a puzzle
and it's got zipper in the top I love
the zipper in the tub and it has two
compartments there's the back
compartment and it's got a little zipper
back here and it's got a front zipper oh
there you go this is cute love that and
then it's got a long strap but if it's
adjustable strap oh it's got an
adjustable strap I'm in love with this
bag who this was $55 with the necklace
and the cream and the nail polish the
nail polish alone is definitely worth at
least I mean it's it's at least just as
good as the opie eyes that I have I mean
it's worth at least eight or nine
dollars to make the only thing I'm
sending back is gonna be these earrings
because they are just gigantic and
that's my fault because it does have the
size displayed and I obviously did not
look to see that they are like an inch
and a half big they're huge and this is
not my fashionable twenty percent off
introductory order what is this Oh for
be fine skincare oh that's cool
hopefully that was helpful for you now I
I got this at the end of november it
only took about maybe three days to ship
to me three or four days to ship to me
and hey yo get off the hand off before i
got this box what baby what's wrong I
already started right now I'm working on
my December bag so when I get my stuff
in my December bag except once I get
this on your video on like a strategy
that I used on little bow tie and
whether it works or not so maybe you can
use or throw out some of my ideas that
they didn't work for how to do your own
little black bag if you decide to do it
alright handle
see you in the next video all right
Johnny what's a bye oh wait come here
come say bye all rights if I make video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
