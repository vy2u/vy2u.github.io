on my porch after like running errands
and my kids all day that I don't even
have room to sit so I had my julep maven
for August even though it's still
technically July and I got this giant
little black bag box like this thing's
crazy about a little black bag little
black bag is a now it's a monthly
subscription service across ten dollars
a month but if you don't use it for the
month and you can use it your ten
dollars for another month so but it's
better to be subscribed if you're
playing on using it because then you get
discounts on stuff further than what
people that aren't subscribes alright so
the first thing that I got it this big
bubble wrap craziness five in a pack
haha this is pretty oh I'm so happy with
this okay so this is the first thing
that I got and I actually added this to
my bag for I think like 15 doll or
something like that and I've seen these
at marshalls for like twenty dollars and
they're not as nice as these so look at
that it's a jewelry holder you hang your
necklaces from there and then it's got
this little dish at the bottom where you
can like just throw up here earring so
this is going to go up on my headboard
like we have a gum like a headboard
where you can actually set stuff on top
so this is gonna go on top and hang my
jewelry it is x sakura italian design so
it's got like an off-white one and a
pink one and they're just really super
cute so that's what the birds look like
up close they almost look like they're
made out of wood and then the metal is
really really sturdy doesn't bend at all
this just seems very very secure like I
really like this a lot I've got the
little rhinestones down the side of the
bird and then little rhinestone
detailing on the eyes and this looks
like it's hand painted this up here so
very very very cute so let's move on to
what I actually got in my original bags
i did add that since it was so stinking
cheap all right these are oh i got two
pairs earrings in here these are really
cute these are by robert rose and there
those are and again i will put the
information right there on exactly the
deal with these i think they're really
pretty so they are Sarah silver color of
course they're not real silver they've
got a loop here that's got a texture to
it and then a loop here that is very
very smooth and then the facts are just
like that and then i got these here by
geranium you're my kids laughing in
there it's such a nice sound okay much
better than screaming okay these are so
pretty i really like these a lot so
that's what those look like and again
there by the company geranium and they
they're really really pretty i love the
design almost kind of reminds me of a
peacock it's at the larger circle is
shape and then the smaller shape at the
top and there is that use some earrings
i got from a little black bag a while
ago these are still on the site i
believe so you can see how these fall
these are just super super pretty i
really like these like i had this one
just a tiny bit longer looks like nobody
wanted and either of these i was trying
to trade these since the beginning of
opening of my bag i had these originally
and nobody I mean I got the horrible
trade offers for those and then these I
ended up trading something for and
nobody wanted those either and you know
of course I was trying to trade up but I
wasn't going to get rid of them because
they really really liked them so i
wasn't going to trade up for something
that I didn't like just to get rid of
beans and try to go higher because what
I'm finding on little black bag is that
if you get something that you like you
really need to keep it and not trade up
for something just because it's a thank
you I'll be right there you really need
to not trade up for things that are
something you don't like because no one
will end up getting stuck with them and
just the trading is completely changed
on there it's a lot harder to trade so
when you do get something you like hang
on to it unless you can really trade for
something you like more that's worth
more really just something you like more
it doesn't even matter of whether it
worth more just something you like more
ok so those are the earrings that i got
and then i got two bags i went in if you
ever see them if you ever think i'm a
trying little black bag the best time to
go in on a brand new little black bag is
when there
offering the free bag promotion I
started off with this giant neon orange
like chote and the thing was hideous I
traded that for like a little gold
clutch and then I traded the gold clutch
for this I am super excited about this
because it is not for me is actually
you'll know who it's for soon as I shown
you check this out let's try dancing
it's better than she is oh my goodness
this is looking oh look how big this
hits all the gates with you fit in the
camera this is for a lie low my
five-year-old and it is so stinking cute
so this is going to be LYLAS overnight
bag when she goes to Grandma's house and
of course Hello Kitty does not have to
be just for kids but my daughter just
happens to love hello kitty it's got a
zipper top that I love so keep all four
junk in there look they even put like a
pillow in there it's like a an air
pillow and look at the inside isn't that
so stinking cute little bow detailing
inside so cute and it's a huge little
zipper in the back I'm a couple of
little pockets here um so it's pretty
traditional inside of a purse but it's
gigantic and Lyle i think is even more
excited than I am well I don't know
maybe I'm more excited than she is
because I've been trying to get her
Hello Kitty back forever oh I forgot
look at the little cute little bow I
tried to unwrap that oh my goodness so
cute and then what I open with should be
the last thing in here mmm she's so
pretty like a dude like revealing it
it's in a little purse bag makes me feel
so fancy
look how pretty my bag is the melee
bianco Tara bag I'm so excited everybody
and their grandmother was trying to take
this from me and I just did not want to
give it up honestly and it was unless
someone traded me like a
two-hundred-dollar bag I wasn't getting
rid of this just because I really wanted
it so I guess I'm one of the problems on
little black bag of why I'm why trading
is so bad because I would not trade this
bag it is just beautiful it feels like
real leather even though I'm sure that
it's not it's got a zipper in the top
that i just opened and it's beautiful
like a goldish tan with a blue brown
polka dots and then it's got pockets of
course the standard bigger pocket little
pocket in the back and then the zipper
on the other side it's funny how all
these persons are designed the same on
the inside the detailing is kind of a
rose gold the strap is a braided it yeah
a braided rated white strap and then of
course these do not spin these are solid
on Keiss a zipper on the side here opens
to the same prints pretty deep size
pocket in there the inside actually
feels a little bit cheap it's not soft
it feels plasticky inside so I have a
feeling that is not going to fare well
the inside of this bag that makes me a
little sad and then it's got a button on
the snap on the side and then the back
opens up to the same pattern and then
you've got the detailing hear the melody
onco detailing on the back overall I am
really happy with this bag so far my
only complaint is the roughness and
I don't know it just feels cheap on the
inside it doesn't feel high quality but
it is a super cute bag and it will last
me probably long enough for me to get a
lot of enjoyment out of it so my total
price all of those things was that
that's including adding to bag this that
I added and this was also extremely
popular on the website I had offers I
forget how much it cost me twelve
fourteen dollars something like that and
I had offers up to forty dollar offers
for this alright thank you so much for
watching this video mad love and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
