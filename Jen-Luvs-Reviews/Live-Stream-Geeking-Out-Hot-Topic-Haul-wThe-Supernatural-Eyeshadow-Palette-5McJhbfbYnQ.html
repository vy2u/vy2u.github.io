so I'm very excited about this this is
totally impromptu I was supposed to be
filming what's it been made up but I'm
procrastinating because I just got my
Hot Topic haul stuff I'm not even in my
makeup room because I don't even have it
set up so that I can even film in there
right now because I'm set to film what's
the makeup hi rose so I'm so excited to
show you what I got from Hot Topic
I haven't shopped at Hot Topic since I
was 17 so what's that 20 years ago I
haven't Java topic but I got inspired
because you may know I'm a huge
supernatural fan TV show and then I
found other stuff that I wanted like
this this is Kira and fizzgig from the
Dark Crystal I needed them in my life
Thank You Morgan
first time here yay I didn't see what
your name was but here I'm glad you
person here okay so that was off topic
and then I got this this the one this I
want to show you the off-topic ones
first this is the offside one oh thank
you oh yeah hot topic has makeup we're
going to show that lasso because you
know I want to show you guys step two so
this is you guys have ever seen the
movie cry-baby it was one my favorite
movie so I got a Johnny Depp shirt I'm
38 years old and I bought myself a
Johnny Depp shirt I don't care okay
I think that he's cute at least then he
was so I got my crybaby Johnny Depp
shirt and my sister-in-law is gonna be
so jealous I'm gonna have to buy her one
and then yes young Johnny Depp and then
I got this carry on my wayward son
I'm so excited with this if you've never
seen Supernatural let me tell you if you
like if it sounds remotely interesting
you should watch it oh yeah I read uh it
really says loving your channel first
time in chat yay so here we go
I'm sure the hot sod is makeup is not
mating I'd say I'm sure it's not oh one
more thing I got before the eyeshadow
palette I'm gonna go through this pretty
quickly though I love cried Beauty to
Dora Pass is your favorite cast is funny
this says driver picks the music shot
gun shots as cakehole and it's an air
freshener for my car
oh thank you I look like to hunt m-28
thank you I'll take it let me see what
it smells like smells like a man it
totally smells like a man my car's gonna
smell like a man I better make my
pleasant smell it before I put in my
cart oh god what man was in your car why
does smell like man in here it's in the
bubble wrap look how big it is huge okay
my eyes are gorgeous what do I have on I
just put a picture on Instagram that
says everything the big sparkle is from
mva cosmetics it's one of their foil
effects and glitters and then the lorac
Pirates of the Caribbean palette but I
just did it getting ready with me on
periscope so you can see it come
together there or you can see the
finished look on Instagram so this is
the eyeshadow palette and it says that
it is let's see does it say where it's
made it says Made in China so I'm
assuming this is not cruelty free this
is none of that
there's red 40 in here say yellow 5 Lake
let's see doesn't look like it's too bad
okay mica Kaelyn sxo palmitate magnesium
stearate phenoxyethanol and Oscar right
which I don't know what that is but
looks like pretty standard eyeshadow
ingredients but look at that isn't that
cute and then here all the eyeshadows oh
my gosh this is so cheesy looking I love
it okay so there we go there are the
shadows and it looks usable so this one
is called baby and this one looks like
doodoo look at that the glitter is so
like it's not even in there like in it
looks like an overspray of like
different colored glitter it's totally
an overspray it's not even built-in I
know it's gigantic it's like Kat Von D
size exactly Lindsay looks cap on these
sides so we've got baby which is the
name of Dean's car and then demon eyes
because all the demons eyes are black
and then angel I guess that's for
Castiel and then jerk because they use
that word a lot grace hunter witchy free
will this I'm gonna cuss so if you have
children around turn out the volume for
a second on looking the wrong way if
your children around turn the volume a
second it says bitch and then possession
I convenes always eating pie and assbutt
and rock salt so they're all oh thank
you Angie
but they're all like references to the
show so let's do some little swatches
why I think Oh oh my goodness got little
text here and it says saving people
hunting things the family business right
there on the mirror and it smells like
chemicals but we're gonna put it on
anyway because you know I got to try it
I had to get it I had to get it so and
it also comes with a brush and it's like
a flat brush so whilst watching with the
brush that they gave this is definitely
an overspray whoa that is weird so I
just watched it but the glitter is not
coming off on the brush it's just it's
just coming off like it looks like it's
like caked in so that's baby
it's definitely that's a serious powder
kick up there's demon eyes not too much
variation there I'm just letting you
know I had low expectations for this
palette how much was the palette uh mmm
how much was it
I got they had a 20% off sale so I got
things 20% I forget but I know it was
under - it was under $20 it was not mad
expensive all right so let's do angel
this is the silver that's probably
usable no no I love the supernatural
more so just wish they didn't slap
pentagrams and everything yeah they do
slap pentagrams and everything don't
they yeah and I can see why people would
not be happy with that okay here's a
jerk this is the neon blue huh I might
be able to use that we'll see isn't
isn't good since glitter isn't working I
know right
yeah I'm not happy that the glitter
looks like an overspray but you know it
is what it is I'm just gonna wipe off
the brush on the box because I don't
have my thing oh thank you so much oh
thank you so much for a comment on my
hair I get so many negative comments
about how my hair is terrible so any
positive I get about my hair I take it
and I run with it not a lot of
difference between these so far we got
grey grey grey with glitter blue
blue let's do hunter which is green it's
a matte green I mean they've got some
pigmentation to them so you know I'll
would Thank You Tricia says she loves
that eye you'd use brushes for swatches
thank you yeah I think it's important to
see how a brush picks up a product
they're definitely really powdery I'll
show you in a second this is witchy it's
the purple and of course it's kind of
graying out which I'm not surprised
oh Jenny thank you so much that's so
nice of you
Hunter is gorgeous what's the name of
the company who made the palette good
question before I do that let me show
you all the powder kick-up that I'm
dealing with here it looks like it says
supernatural and all related characters
or elements of Warner Brothers
Incorporated 13 eyes shadow palette
ingredients manufactured exclusively for
Hot Topic
made in China distributed by gbg Beauty
LLC in New York so gbg beauty but this
was made specifically for Hot Topic all
right let's do free will which is like a
pink it's like a shimmery peachy color
which is blending into my skin tone but
you can see it a little bit oh I think
my husband loves this artist I forget
what her name is but thank you oh my
nephew Jordan is here hi Jordan how are
you tell everybody I said hi
all right that is not good that is the B
word now my nephew's here he's a
teenager so he's heard that word before
but still nobody's ever heard me say it
yeah that's not so good and then
possession which is like a brown like a
taupe that came out very nice and the
next one is pie which I have hi I uh I
can't say it in front of Jordan I can't
do it he was I know he's so heard that
word so many times that one's nice the
pie one there's pie and then we've got a
butt
which looks like it'll be nice always
like a base you can't see it on my
skintone Oh Jennifer activated super
Chad that's so nice put a picture of
Dean on that pallet
there you go new cares with the
eyeshadow looks like I'm totally with
you and the last one is rock salt I'm
definitely going to be doing a look with
these though I don't know for the
channel but we'll see they're very
they're very mediocre so let's do I'm
just gonna do the white test with my
hands that's actually not as bad as I
thought it was going to be that's not
bad at all
lack o yep you got it Becca that's not
as bad as I thought it was going to be
it's not bad at all but powder kick up
is for reals
powder kick up is for reals so I love
supernatural I am all caught up I've
watched every single episode I'm a huge
supernatural fan so I'm gonna do a
little blow it into the box so I'm very
excited to try this yes there are
pentagrams and stuff on I know a lot of
people don't like that stuff but I do
believe that the palette is new oh it
says $14.90 on the back um so yeah so
that must have been how much it was but
then I got um I got a deal it was 20%
off so so yeah so I'm definitely going
to be playing with this and I'll let you
know if it's just mediocre you'll
probably never see it again
but if it's really bad or really good
you'll probably see it in a in a
favorites video I got it from Hot Topic
calm so yes and now I'm gonna totally
smell like a man because of this it
smells like man in here it's still going
in my car because it's so funny but yeah
I'm actually relatively impressed
considering what it is I had zero
expectation I thought it was going to be
a powdery mask
completely come off and it didn't so I'm
excited
so yeah but it's huge it's definitely
huge but alright my friends hello Angela
Angelia and Angelia in Kentucky hello
alright I'm gonna pop off here and I'm
gonna go some what's at the make up I
just wanted to show you my haul and I
don't think I should be wearing I'm

video though I have to I have to I love
