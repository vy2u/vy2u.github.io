impromptu livestream today we're going
to be talking about the clay play face
shaping palette by tarte we're gonna do
some quick finger swatches and talk
about my first impression of this i am
wearing it on my eyes today I do have
something on top of it though because I
wanted a little bit of shine I have the
L'Oreal infallible paints metallics this
is called brass knuckles and I've got
this topping over top but that's the
eyeshadow that I'm wearing today so I do
have some of first impressions from
using it from today but I want to show
you the swatches as well since this is
brand new I got this on the I believe it
was old I guess from Ulta they let
Platinum's get a hand on this first I
know some people were sent this for PR
so there are some reviews of this out
already
I saw Leon says talked about this this
morning I think it was this morning when
this video came out so there are some
other videos on this already even though
it's not technically out yet so I did
purchase a so this is not PR so this is
a live chat I will be talking to the
people that are here in the live chat so
if that bothers you I'm really sorry but
that's the way I like to do it so sorry
but I am gonna do swatches if you're
curious about the painting behind me I
was get asked about that her name the
artist name is kaya Koopman I know it
looks like her heads chopped off but
kaya Pittman she's amazing artists so
anyway I'm gonna go say hello to a
couple of people
hello to Rachel and Tristan she says I
want the palette coming out this fall
that does look very interesting hi
Allison and very good to see you so when
you open this up you get these little
pans and then you get longer pans that
everything in here is matte so you get
two here that are a little bit lighter
and then here you get a little deeper
and then you get just a little deeper
here which i think is great because I
feel like this can go for anybody of any
skin tone and it's all matte so this is
a really nice one I set up wise for
people that like those really natural no
thought about it kinds of looks you get
a light a medium and a deep in each tone
which is very well thought out you also
get three different bronzers here that
are all mad so this is terracotta desert
and
Timber we're gonna swatch everything
though some people said that this looked
very boring um I can see that for color
lovers this is gonna be very boring
you're not going to be enjoying this if
you were a big bright color lover hello
to Ellie and hello to Michelle and first
time in a while I've been interested in
a chart palette that's awesome yay
well I don't know I don't know if you're
gonna be well you might be once I'm done
watching so let's go ahead and start
with the first trio here we've got
journey stone and solstice now when I
was watching this morning on periscope
because I get ready to film once at the
make up on Fridays on periscope I was
not impressed with solstice let's go
ahead and start here so that is journey
this is stone and then this is solstice
solstice is extremely powdery and it
blends away very very quickly I tried to
pop it in the inner corner it just
wasn't happening and I was very
disappointed in it but the other shades
I've worked with have been great so I
have journey right now all over my lids
and then I have smoke in the outer
corner I just show you right now so
these are the middle three this is dunes
smoke and sand so here's dunes smoke and
sand so that's the the lightest shade
here and this is the one I ended up
using on my brow bone because solstice
was so stinking weak Dale says I want
color lover not feeling this one I hear
you I totally hear you so that was these
three right here those are the next
three and now let's go ahead should have
brought a towel over here because I have
like jeans on I'm not wiping them on my
pants today
sometimes when I'm dark jeans on I just
wipe my pants on my pants
cuz I can't see it anyway it washes out
you know anyway
amber onyx and instinct so let's pop
these babies here amber onyx instinct
let me get another swatch into instinct
I have a little bit of arm hair there
let's watch instinct on the inside see
if you can see that a little better
nope still really powdery mmm yeah I'm
not sure about that one I'm not sure
about that one but I did really like
sand this morning
try to kind of rub it in a little bit
lisa says it reminds me of the Kat Von D
shade and light palette without the
tonal variations kind of Megan says at
least the black looks decent a lot of
blacks look weak and patchy yeah the
black does look really nice let me try
to build the black up a little bit now
that I've totally wiped off that's the
finger swatch Bayeux right there
let's try to build it up a little bit I
mean that is a black no joke no joke oh
thank you copy says I look great thank
you this is my wanted to make up filming
look Europe you're by film today okay
this is not happening hold on this is
ridiculous yes Oh Matt AJ all Matt Thank
You Claudia hold on hold on let me get
it all right
hi paper towels over here okay um that
was fast
okay so a little bit better there and
then we're gonna go ahead and swatch the
bronzers here we have terracotta desert
which is the one I contoured with today
and it blended so nicely when I
contoured with it I'm not typically a
huge fan of tart eyeshadows but I'm
actually really enjoying it so far those
are the three contour stage so you can
see there's a really deep one right
there
and don't feel like you're limited to
using these for contour you can also use
them for eyeshadow which is great where
did I get my earrings I got these at
Target $3.50 I got this pair and a pair
of Hoops on sale for three dollars and
fifty cents mm-hmm
so hopefully they're still there I don't
know if they would still be there
because they weren't like on clearance
but yeah I know right
um Mahara I think it says I love your
videos thank you for the reviews you are
so welcome hi Nancy she said I agree
that tarts version of the Brad shade
light palette pretty much pretty much
let's go ahead and wipe these off this
is the one I used to contour today and I
really like the way that it blended so
let's just go ahead and do a little bit
of this and this is kind of showing you
what would happen if you over blended
the shadows we were like blending the
heck out of them all so it gives a sign
tilt to where time because you can see
whether it kind of stains on the lid so
you can see a lot of these are really
sticking around
really
really well which is fantastic look at
these contour shades it's wonderful it's
wonderful so I mean really and truly I
feel like this is gonna be a good one
from Tarte I'm really excited about it I
do have a little bit of powder kick up
here on this one but overall not super
powdery not like the lorac ones that are
very very powdery AJ says I really love
those colors but don't don't like tark
shadows are these different I'm gonna
have to look into the ingredients on
that I will put something once I have
time some time today I'll put something
in the description about the ingredients
and whether they're different because
I'm not a big fan of tort shadows either
like for example the I did a review of
the Tarte Pro palette and with that one
I liked the shimmery shades but I found
that the other shades tended to muddy
together a bit I didn't find that today
but I think that they purposely made it
so you got these trios
so you can use this one on your lid this
one in your to deepen up and then this
one for your lighter shade you know and
same thing all the way around they've
done that on purpose to make it really
easy to work with so from first
impressions and based on the wear time
where times looking pretty good which is
also unusual for me for a Tarte palette
a lot of times the torah' eyeshadows
wear away pretty quickly I am wearing
yes it does smell like vanilla brandy
yes it does it does smell like vanilla
it has that strong scent and as soon as
I opened it I smelled it um but anyway
so I feel like this would be a really
great palette for someone that like
works in an office you know doesn't
really care a lot about doing an
intricate I look you just want to throw
something on your face and go out the
door in the morning this seems like it
would be really good for that and I am
I'm really excited about this one I
think that it's gonna be great as I use
it more since this I just got this
yesterday I just use it for the first
time today if I have any updates I will
put them in the video description for
you but as of now this is a really great
palette there's only two shades that I
feel like or a little bit weak and those
are these two here everything else seems
to be wonderful is it cheaper than the
Kat Von D I honestly can't remember what
I paid for it because it was an impulse
buy and I don't have the receipt right
in front
me but I will put that in the video
description as well but you can look it
up actually I can look it up real quick
cuz that's gonna bother me let me look
it up real quick before we before we get
off here hold on a second
uh-oh uh-oh ah get my old app on my
cracked phone look what I did to my
phone do you see that it's terrible look
at that really Jen really okay maybe
later I don't even know what's asking me
okay so this is called the clay play
clay play okay $46 hmm
$46 I don't think I was expecting to
like it but I do I do really like it and
I've had great luck with Tarte cheek
products with the highlights and the
contours recently so I thought I would
give it a shot and I wanted to share it
with you because it's know so I think
that it's it's definitely impressed me
so I'm excited about it so far oh I
forgot to show you something Andrea says
I love your channel thank you so much
and Janice says you look amazing thank
you so much I forgot to show you it does
come with this little booklet as well it
says get the looks play play face
shaping palette and then it's got these
different looks here so it's a simple
sexy eye and feathered brow classic soft
smokey eye and ombre brow and then the
diffused cat eye and bold brow I
personally prefer to hold on man I can't
get him oh I got him block okay um I'm
sorry I had someone asking me to take my
clothes off that was interesting so
anyway I personally prefer with these
things here to have a diagram and then a
live picture that's that's what I like
is with the diagram you can really see
where the shades go
that's just my my personal preference
with things like this so Julie wants to
know is it better quality than Kat Von D
shade + light I don't own the Kat Von D
shade + light unfortunately so I can't
from personal experience talk about that
but I can say that there are two shades
that seem to be a little weak in here
and I don't know if there are any in the
Kat Von D but so far I am quite
impressed
so that is yeah Allison says well it is
a nude palette that's very true that's a
great point so I'm going to go ahead and
pop off here and I want to thank you so
much for joining me for this impromptu
live stream I
have another box from ulta coming a
sleek makeup that I would love to do
