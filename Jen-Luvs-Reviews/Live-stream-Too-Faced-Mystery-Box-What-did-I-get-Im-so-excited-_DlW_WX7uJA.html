box in the mails this is another
impromptu livestream I did film today so
I've got my eyes on I'm wearing on my
eyes today the I'm doing the test decide
is the Anasazi Beverly Hills hello
my husband's playing video over next to
me this is Anasazi of Beverly Hills
prison palette and this is the hush-hush
dough shop hush beauty what's it called
just dump out the aura palette by beauty
something what is it
bad habit bad habit I got it hello
everybody so we're gonna open up this
this was $39 +5 dollars shipping and
handling which made it be a total of
what is that 39 44 dollars and I got the
scissors and then I left them on the
couch so I'm just gonna use my little
nail file thing to open up the box
because I'm so excited
and I can't wait to see what is in here
and see whether it is worth the $44 let
me show you closed the lighting isn't
that great in here I'm still having
issues of my live streaming but thank
you guys so much that the the scrolling
is going by very very quickly so it's
hard for me to read dawn says hit and
miss with mystery boxes yes and Stevie
says hello hope you're doing having a
good day I hope you're having a good day
too and usually a lot of times these
boxes will be things that they're trying
to get rid of for one reason or another
it's not usually like new products or
anything so mystery bag 2017 these were
available on Black Friday and I jumped
on it cuz I love mystery boxes because
it's like the lottery you know okay so
it looks like it's a package like this
and that's it okay so it's a little
these are cute little bags though it's
like a cute little ziploc bag
you'll see okay so I got a mini better
than sex mascara I just shook you sorry
I got you okay so a mini better than sex
mascara I do like this mascara it is a
little bit clumpy I have used it before
so I'm not just where if I'll keep this
or do this for a giveaway just because
I've already tried it but a lot of times
I want to like test if I can find
drugstore mascara that's similar to this
I might want to do like a head-to-head
comparison so this will be right now
it'll go in like for a future giveaway
but I might end up breaking into it if I
want to compare it to something else
okay next up we got a la creme lipstick
I love la creme lipsticks because
they're very hydrating it looks like
it's in the shade double bubble which is
another shade that I probably won't like
because I don't like hot pink it's a hot
pink lipstick it kind of looks like I
just I did an unboxing of the Marc
Jacobs mystery box and it looks a lot
like that shade that I definitely won't
use so it's a bright bright pink let me
show you Clara from Marc Jacobs which is
the one that I got in their mystery box
with Cynthia I want to know if I could
do a tutorial on this eye look possibly
I have to I have to see whether like
what look I'll do for the review video
that I'm filming later this week so this
is the Marc Jacobs Clara and then this
is the Too Faced one so Marc Jacobs in
to face side basically the same idea of
giving a neon pink lipstick in their
mystery box and I don't wear neon pink
lipstick so this will probably go to the
same person I haven't told her yet that
I'm giving this to her so this will
probably go in I'm gonna send her these
two things this will go to her as well
but I'm not telling cuz she may be here
floating around somewhere okay so anyway
okay so this is perfect eyes to face
perfect eyes waterproof eyeliner okay
Florie says la creme is my favorite
formula i love la cremes to Florrie okay
so it's in perfect black I actually
already own this so this is definitely
gonna go in for a future giveaway it's
an okay liner I do find that it it kind
of runs down a little bit if I wear my
waterline but I do like it on the upper
lash line it is it's pretty nice got a
little smudge around the back I do
already have this though I got a smaller
one recently and the the Too Faced the
agenda the boss lady beauty agenda AJ
says la creme was so heavy on my lips
not a fan really ac I found that to be
hydrating I guess it's just I don't know
I like I can see where you're coming
from on that did it felt heavy I like I
like it like that because I feel like
it's kind of hydrating Elizabeth says
definitely a Trisha Paytas color there
you go oh the peanut butter and jelly
palette which I also already own Wow
future giveaway okay one more thing in
here the lipstick I'm wearing right now
is by OCC and I can't I think it's
called - I believe and that on top of it
I have
it's called Felix Felicis and it is from
the Harry Potter collection by shiro
cosmetics and that is a big spoiler for
the video that's supposed to be going up
tomorrow alright and then the last thing
i got is the size queen mascara which
I've never tried so I will keep this
because I've never tried this size queen
huh I've never even heard of that you
guys heard of that Amy Lu says that she
got the cat eyes palette which I don't
own so there you go I've never tried
this I've never heard of this mascara I
must have I'm sure you must have
reported on it or maybe it's just an
older mascara that they're discontinuing
or whatever okay so was this worth $44
to me absolutely not that's one thing in
here that I definitely like just the
mascara so uh-huh davit says okay let me
try to get everybody to come by chat and
she doesn't realize we're already live
sorry cab if you're watching this on the
replay on
I'm gonna be off pretty soon anyway so
yeah so this is the only thing that's
that's new to me that I will use but
there's there's no real way to know you
know I mean they send things out they
don't know what my collection is like
someone says size Queen means something
adults well that's not new for two-faced
Dahlia says the mascaras at Nordstrom
Rack for $9.99 I believe it so this box
was worth $9.99 for me not a good one
but one good thing though is I do have
some hi Stacy
I do have some things that I now have
for future giveaway that I think will be
nice and I have another gift for my
friend to go with the other gift that I
was gonna send her I've got a couple
things I want to send her and then these
will all be for giveaway so
but well but it'll make it it'll be nice
to forgive away for a future yes I can
hold everything up so we've got the
peanut butter and jelly palette we've
got the better than sex
mini mascara we've got the size queen
mascara and the perfect eyes eyeliner
and the la creme lipstick in double
bubble
so that was $44 and this is definitely
worth monetarily more than $44 and
definitely would be great gifts maybe
I'll give the peanut butter and jelly
palette away to somebody for a gift
because this does make a very nice gift
that's a good point but I don't know
that many people like in my like real
like day-to-day life I don't have any
people that are that into makeup like
how many people husband do I know that
like that I talk to all the time that
are in the makeup like nobody man just
you so yeah so that's gonna be it for
this video thank you so much for being
here I yeah I mean I guess it's worth it
if you consider that I'm gonna save
money on a gift because the pinboard
jelly palette is a nice palette I call
him husband because my son's name is
John as well so that's why I call him
husband so it's easier to you know say
even though my husband's like upstairs
right now I don't know I call him
husband it's easier anything like John
and they're both like why all right you
guys have a wonderful rest of your day
thank you so much they're all saying hi
husband thank you guys so much for being
here I appreciate it I hope you enjoyed
this little short video tomorrow we're
gonna be doing a video it's 25 gift
ideas makeup gift ideas under $25 or $25
or under so that's coming up tomorrow
bad love see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
