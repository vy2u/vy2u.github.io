least new to me subscription to share
with you and it is called lucid box and
when when Lucic box contacted me and
said they wanted me to do a review other
subscription service I was expecting a
box in the mail which was you know it's
called lucid box but this is what I got
I got this almost if see looking red
package and I've been wanting to open it
and wanting to open it and I have not
opened it because I wanted to be a true
first impression for you okay so I'm on
the lucid box website it says a jewelry
surprise every month it's from twenty
six dollars a month you subscribe and
you get to jewelry surprises every month
the value of each box varies between
fifty eight dollars and seventy four
dollars loose in New York jewelry brand
will be using the lucid boxes a
promotional tool we hope that after
receiving the box will go to loose in
New York calm to check out what else
there is so month a month is twenty nine
dollars a month plus free shipping
three-month plan is twenty seven dollars
a month plus free shipping and then one
year plan is twenty-six dollars per
month which is also free ship month the
monkey pay twenty nine three months is
81 and then a whole year is 312 dollars
now that technicality is out of the way
let's go ahead and open and see what
we've got so I always liked getting new
ones because you never know what is
gonna happen and as always I always tell
the company that I am very honest in my
reviews so I always give them that heads
up if I don't like it I don't like it
and that I'm gonna be honest about it so
the first thing I'm fooling out is a
piece of paper and it says today I feel
positively and then it's got a bunch of
positive words on it I stumbled upon the
blog positively present calm today and
thought it'd be a great idea to share
the list above and it says what's in
there so I'm not gonna read anymore cuz
I don't want to know what's in here I
just want to go both in the same little
bag that's really cute it's like a
sateen bag and then that's the one side
and then that's the other side very cute
he's so the first thing I'll pull out is
the necklace it's rose gold colored oh
that's cute t I didn't open this before
yesterday yesterday was Valentine's Day
in real time I know that it's past
Valentine's Day now but this is really
cute it's like a little heart I don't
know I like the chain the chain has
little tiny um I don't know i'll show
you okay so there's the heart and then
you can see the chain has like little I
don't know little dots on it that are
bigger than the rest of the chain it's
very cute so it goes down like right
bill okay it's cute this is this is
going to be good in the in the
springtime with like a tank top or like
a maxi dress or something like that
something really long the only thing I
don't really like about it is this
crease on the side okay so i don't know
if you can see that but there's like a
crease right here where they put the
pieces together and i personally look
that think that looks a little bit cheap
but i don't think anybody's really gonna
notice that especially when it's hanging
this way but but yeah i mean overall
really like it bracelets oh these are
cute they're like little bangle
bracelets okay so you get three bangles
or for bengals you get three very thin
gold ones and then you get this one here
that's a gold with some little like
rhinestones so there's two then one then
two then four so that's very interesting
very cute so as far as value for this
I'm really sure I think it's really this
is another one of those that's gonna
depend on personal preference I think
that it's nice to try out new jewelry
pieces especially if you really really
love jewelry I don't know I mean I think
I'm on the fence about this one as far
as it being twenty six dollars a month I
mean I did get a necklace and some
bangles but
not really sure about this again it's 29
just doing month to month and then 27
for three months and then the one-year
plan is 26 I personally if I were
subscribe to this I would go for the
three-month one because it does cut a
couple dollars down but you don't have
to really commit to a huge amount like a
whole year and I would definitely want
to see more of these to see whether it
be worth it to get more jewelry and
again it has to do with your addiction
to are you addicted to jewelry if you
are then maybe you want to sign up for a
longer subscription so I hope you
enjoyed this box opening well bag
opening of lucid box if you did make
sure you give it a thumbs up and then
maybe Lusa box will send me another one
we will see so again thank you for
watching make sure you subscribe if
you'd like to see more box openings I
have a gazillion box opening is coming
up in the next week or two so looking
forward to showing you all of those mad
love and I will see you in a video very
very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
