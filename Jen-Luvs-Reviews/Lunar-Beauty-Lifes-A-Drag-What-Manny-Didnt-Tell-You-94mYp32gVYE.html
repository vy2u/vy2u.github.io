launch today and I want to put some
information out there that I know is
going to be controversial I wanted to
kind of get ahead of it and get you this
information before you purchase it so
you could make a more educated choice as
far as whether you wanted to purchase
this palette or not so that's why I
wanted to make this and give you the
best information possible on this
palette so you can make the choice
that's right for you so if that sounds
like something you were interested in
hearing hang tight we're getting into it
right now so as you know manis life's a
drag palette launches today from his
brand-new brand lunar beauty if you do
not know who Manny MUA is I will put his
handsome face there he is a youtuber
he's also on instagram he has millions
of followers and everyone that follows
him and people that don't follow him
have been waiting with bated breath to
see what his first launch was going to
be for his cosmetic brand turns out if
this palette called life's a drag he
released a video that explained life's
to drag and why he chose to do a drag
themed palette about all of the shades
and then in the middle of the video this
is what he said this product is cruelty
free which I'm so excited about announce
that as well but I also wanted to shoot
my shot basically at creating something
that was vegan as well and create a
palette that had no carmine in it which
is basically a byproduct of red beetles
so many brands use it it's a very very
very commonly used thing but when you
use carmine you can't claim to be vegan
because it is a byproduct of an animal
so when you're doing a matte shade or
any kind of shade that involves some
type of reds or Purple's or Burgundy's
anything like that
you have to use these red dyes you know
red forty things like that so due to the
fact that it is a red dye it's a pigment
it is possible for it to stain the eye
area the media is oh there is a warning
on the back of the pallets I have
personally used them all and I have
turned out fine I do not have staining
on my eyes but if you are extremely
sensitive you could potentially have
staining on your eyes everybody has
their electric palette MAC Cosmetics has
press pigments as well I legally have to
say those red dyes potentially could
stain your lids it does happen to me no
not necessarily but could it happened to
someone that's really really
really sensitive it could potentially so
basically I decided to make this
decision because I did not want to have
carmine in my products I really really
really wanted to give those bugs a shot
you know I really wanted to be as vegan
as possible but because of time
management wise I couldn't register this
product as vegan it could only be
cruelty-free sorry now it's cruelty free
but technically does begin because
there's no carmine in it as well anyway
that is the T about that so she you guys
are aware and you guys know what's going
on I use them I'm totally fine I've
never had any stain inge with any of the
shadows before so it is what it is and
honestly I feel like you guys will be so
understanding because I really did not
want to use animal by-products in my
product I did the best that I could and
I am so proud of what we came up with so
I watched this and I went mani what did
you do what did you do I automatically
thought oh you put red six or red seven
in there I know it I know he did I know
you're going to go into a bunch of
information you just googled you are not
a cosmetic chemist you do not know what
you are talking about and therefore I
cannot trust any self
well constructive criticism Kelly I
you're right I am NOT a cosmetic chemist
nor my a dermatologist or anything like
that I do have multiple degrees that did
require me to learn how to
professionally research so I do know how
to research pretty well I also learn how
to find good sources versus sources that
you shouldn't use all of my sources so
for the information I'm providing to you
will be in the video description so you
can check them out yourself and the
format of this video is me presenting
that information to you from these
professional sources and then kind of
giving you my interpretation of how I
feel about it it is up to you to do what
is best for you what you feel is right
regardless of my opinion so the fact
that I am NOT a cosmetic chemist and
that I did use Google in order to find
these things
it doesn't invalidate the fact that
these things are true there is a lot of
true information that you can gather
from government websites that will give
you valid information about things like
this so that's the kind of information
I'm providing to you this is a quote
from the FDA website with the exception
of one class of hair dyes all color
additives for
cosmetics must be specifically
pre-approved for use by the Food and
Drug Administration another quote that
Manning needs to be super careful about
use of unapproved color additive in a
cosmetic product or of an approved color
additive but in an unapproved manner
which is if he called his pallet and
eyeshadow palette makes the product
illegal adulterated and subject to
seizure by the FDA so he needs to be
super super careful on his packaging and
on his website that he does not call it
an eyeshadow palette ever since I've
been reviewing eyeshadows we've talked
about different pigments that are not
eye safe but companies will often put
these pigments in shadows just like
Manny said because number one they want
their products to be vegan they don't
want to use carmine and they're really
really good as far as their performance
goes they're just not FDA approved for
the eye I do happen to have the Urban
Decay electric palette which was when I
first became aware of all of these
pigment issues and it says here on the
back it says warning slow burn savage
jilted and urban are not intended for
the immediate eye area and when people
found that out they've left out oh my
god people freaked out and those are of
course the red shades here and the
purple shades here because they need
those red pigments this is not called an
eyeshadow palette this is called a
pressed pigment palette and I would
imagine Manny's will say something
similar so ever since I have found this
in I shadow z' I have thought why but
why are these not I safe and I've looked
and I've looked and I've looked and I've
tried to find why they are not I safe so
when someone named Megan contacted me
after my box of crayons debacle on their
packaging I ended up asking her now let
me tell you what how she describes her
job she says that she is an industry
professional specializing in formula
troubleshooting product formulations and
helping small companies with federal and
label compliance I figured she would be
a good person to ask about why why why
why red six in red seven and also red 28
Lake which is also in Manny's palette
why those are
not ice safe this is her quote she says
the FDA is a dinosaur that's what she
says
the FDA considers staining as the same
thing as dying so when you are putting
these eyeshadows on if it's stains your
lid that's the same thing as dying your
skin which is a big no-no
for the FDA the skin dying is considered
a big bad the other thing she mentioned
was that when these pigments were tested
for FDA approval a lot of them were
naturally derived we're now a lot of
them are synthetically derived they're
still considered the same pigment
they're just not made the same as they
used to be back when they were naturally
derived they could have things in them
like arsenic and lead and heavy metals
and things like that they're really
really really bad she believes that
that's part of the reason why they were
considered not ice safe so I dug and I
dug and I dug and I dug I was able to
find a study for each of the pigments
that are in Manny's palette one is four
red seven the other was four red 28 by
the way I know they're in Manny's
palette because he actually was kind
enough to send me his ingredient list
which was so incredibly awesome of him
so that could give you as much
information as I could about this
product so thank you Manny for giving me
that information I appreciate you so
much but essentially the results of
those two studies was that they put in
higher concentration than you would find
in makeup into animal eyes and to rabbit
eyes it did cause irritation in for both
pigments but nothing that caused any
kind of permanent damage for the rabbits
now I know people are going to say oh my
gosh this is not cruelty-free if these
pigments were tested on animals then
it's not cruelty-free and what it comes
down to is that all of major ingredients
that are in cosmetics that have been in
cosmetics for many many many years
including pigments have been tested on
animals at some point if Manny's
cosmetics are cruelty free then it means
that these particular pigments that are
in Manny's palette were not tested on
animals but that ingredient may have
been tested many many years ago on
animals I have a very in-depth interview
with Courtney from fair and NYX that I
will link down below if you want to
like debunk some myths about cruelty
free any information about cruelty free
I'll link that video down below in case
you want to check it out so the question
now is what does that mean so when
you're talking about pigments that are
at such a high concentration its chances
are in Manny's palette we're not talking
about that high of a concentration
typically the majority of an eyeshadow
formula is going to be your talc your
mica may be dimethicone other
ingredients that are commonly seen in
the top of the ingredient list but the
chance of one of those pigments being
more than one percent of the entire
product is very very slim because what's
gonna end up happening is this eye
shadow is gonna fall apart you need
those binding agents you need all of
those other ingredients to make the eye
shadow work so that particular pigment
is going to not be very good in a
pressed form if it's too high if there's
too much of that pigment in there
another thing that's very important to
note is that both red 7 and red 28 are
both approved for IU's in the European
Union and one thing that Meghan
mentioned was that the European Union is
much better at regulating cosmetics than
we are with the FDA the FDA doesn't have
a lot of money they don't have a lot of
staff to update things like this and she
mentions their petitions that go back to
the year 2000 asking for some of these
pigments to be updated as far as the
regulations and according to her they
haven't even been started yet so the
European Union actually updated their
database about a week ago
that's how on top of things they are as
far as keeping things updated in their
system these two pigments are still
considered okay for use in all cosmetics
the only way that you cannot use red 28
Lake is if it is one percent or more in
the product in the European Union but
even though even though they're more
up-to-date on things than the FDA that
does not mean they're perfect because if
you get eye irritation from eyeshadows
you know that there are lots of
ingredients that can irritate the eye
that are FDA approved and approved in
the European Union such as talc such as
phenoxyethanol such as bismuth
oxychloride there are so many
ingredients in foundations in concealers
in plushies in
eyeshadows that irritate different
people so what I did was I went on my
Twitter and I asked my Twitter followers
have you ever used an eyeshadow that was
not approved as eye safe if you did what
happened
the majority vast majority of people
said that had tried it said yes I used
it it stained my lids but it didn't
irritate my eyes or nothing happened it
didn't irritate my eyes however there
were a few people more than a few people
that said that it did irritate their
eyes so this is where we go from me
presenting facts to you to me presenting
my personal opinion after doing all of
this research I have changed my opinion
on not I safe pigments before this video
I would not have used an eye shadow that
had pigments in it that were considered
not safe for the eye area after doing
all of this research and realizing what
kind of bunk the fda's process is and
how it hasn't been updated in all the
holes in there reasons why it's not AI
safe I now personally feel comfortable
using pigments that are not i safe
according to the fda on my personal eyes
where i would not use them is on the
waterline i would keep them on my lid
because it kind of freaks me out to get
some of those pigments in such a high
concentration in my eye that's the way i
personally feel about it but you have to
decide for you what's best for you and
that's why i wanted to give you all of
this information I feel like Manny kind
of said it in his video that they
weren't eye safe without saying they
weren't eye safe so due to the fact that
it is a red dye it's a pigment it is
possible for it to stain the eye area
the media is oh there is a warning on
the back of the palette I have
personally used them all and I have
turned out fine I do not have staining
on my eyes but if you are extremely
sensitive you could potentially have
staining on your eyes he kind of danced
around it and that was where I was kind
of like you got to tell him Manny just
bite the bullet and tell them so you as
the collective brain as people that I
care about I wanted to make
sure you had this information before you
went and purchased it today so I want to
