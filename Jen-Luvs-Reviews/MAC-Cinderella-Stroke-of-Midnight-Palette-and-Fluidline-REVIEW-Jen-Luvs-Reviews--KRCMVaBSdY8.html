review of the two products that i got
from the max Cinderella collection let
me tell you i do not own a lot of mac
products because Mac is so hyped up on
YouTube and everybody seems to own a
bunch of mac so I figure you know what's
the point of getting back products
because everybody knows that max awesome
so it's like you know it's art if
everybody knows it's awesome then
there's no point in me reviewing it does
that make sense I don't know the same
reason why I don't get the the
colour-pop cosmetics cuz everybody says
that they're awesome so there's no
controversy is it so what do I need to
review before so that's why one of the
reasons why I've never really per slot
in that cosmetics but they got me with
the whole Cinderella thing because I
think every girl woman you know has this
thing and maybe not every but I think
most women kind of have this connection
with disney princesses and just
princesses in general and that idea of
being a princess and all those things I
think a lot of women really buy into
that and I think going with a Cinderella
collection was really smart of Mac but
let me just tell you what I think of the
two different things we'll start with
the fluid line I got the fluid line and
macro violet which is basically a gel
eyeliner and let me just say I'm not
super impressed this one supposedly is a
reproach I think I don't think that this
is brand new i'm pretty sure that it's
been released before they're also saying
that it is new in a new collection that
they have out right now but i don't
think that it's new from what I've heard
from people either way I'm still not
that impressed with the product let me
just kind of do a little swatch for you
I'm going to put it on this little it's
just a little baby it cosmetics eyeliner
brush so there is the swatch there for
it and you can see it's just like a deep
plum color oh and the reason why I'm not
super impressed with this is I feel like
when you put this on your lid it gives
you a nice purple color but then I feel
like the more you mess with it the more
it doesn't keep its opacity so if you go
over it you know that swatch turned out
great because I only hit it one time but
if you feel like you need to keep going
with it like if it's not you know quite
straight or you know you're not really
happy with the way it initially comes
out I feel like it starts losing its
pigmentation and I don't really like
that
also it does take a hot minute to set so
um you know I don't know it's just not
my favorite formula of gel eyeliners and
i don't think i'll be purchasing another
mac fluidline unless i hear something
amazing about one in particular I'm just
not that impressed with this formula is
it is it okay yeah it's fine i mean the
where time was pretty typical for a gel
liner i mean it lasted through my work
day and a little bit beyond really
wonderful about this color it's just
kind of like a deep plum I would have
liked if it had some kind of like subtle
shimmer in it or something to make it
unique and it just doesn't okay speaking
of that lets talk about the palette this
is called the stroke of midnight palette
and it comes with five shades that have
already been released by mac and the
only one that's new is this one down
here here we have vapor we have floof we
have Corey we have Omega we have satin
taupe and then we have stroke of
midnight which is the new one now I've
heard things about this that the shades
are not transferring the way that they
should the way that they normally do and
these singles in the mac singles and i
will swatch these for you i just did
finger swamped so those are the finger
swatches there I know my nails need to
be done so bad okay so there's that and
then let me get the last two these are
not gentle finger swatches like I'm like
going into these this one this one is
vapor this is floof omega quarry satin
taupe stroke of midnight so there's the
colors I mean and I don't know I'm just
not super impressed I'm not super
present there's a couple of them that i
really like let me zoom back out and
i'll talk to you about the ones that i
really ok so my big gripes about this
you didn't get this i don't want you to
cry because i don't think it's something
that you can't live without i mean i
don't feel like you missed out on
something especially if you are my skin
tone or darker the color combination
here you can tell is meant for someone
of Cinderella's skin tone and there
isn't anything deeper than satin taupe
so this is a really nice crease color
for me but there I mean well other than
the stroke of midnight but I feel like
there needed to be some middle ground
between these two as far as a d
burr-brown shade I feel like they could
have done without one of these matte
shades and done one that was a bit
deeper so move satin taupe up keep this
one throw out what is this one favor
flew Omega so throw out throw out Omega
put in a deeper brown and then keep
satin taupe keep this one and I just
feel like it would have been a better
palate overall the only shades in here
that I am super impressed with right now
our flu and satin taupe which I was
hoping that I would love satin taupe as
much as I thought I would and I do love
it so these two right here the rest I
feel like you could get in and many many
other eye shadow palettes I don't think
that they're amazing I mean even stroke
of midnight I don't think it's amazing I
feel like it's just I mean it's it's a
deep blue color with some pink shimmers
in it and I mean it's fine and it's nice
for smoking out that outer corner it's
nice for a lower lash line if you're
looking for a really deep look this
would be beautiful but for me personally
this isn't one that makes me go wow
that's amazing so I mean so for my my
first online map purchase I'm not super
impressed I'm not blown away I do wish
that I got one of the lipsticks the
lipsticks were available when I was
online and I didn't get them and I'm
kicking myself but I didn't I mean I
would love to know some of your favorite
Mac products down below anything that I
personally you think I definitely can't
live without that I should purchase from
Mac and maybe the next time i order i
will pick up one of your favorites
because i need some suggestions these
did not hit the mark for me so that's my
review of the two products that i got
