review of the brand new Mac and Gabriel
Zamora
lorilee lipsticks I'm excited to share
my pins with you of these limited
edition youtuber releases if you have
never heard of Laura Lee and/or Gabriel
Zamora they are both youtubers it is
very rare I don't even know if it's ever
happened that Mac has collaborated with
youtubers they've chosen a handful of
youtubers around the world to
collaborate with on lipsticks and they
are limited edition releases Mac was
kind enough to send me these ahead of
time they do release tomorrow which is
April 20th now the kicker is you can
only get the lipsticks from the country
of origin of your Creator so these are
the only two we'll be able to get in the
United States which was a total bummer I
think that was a huge mistake
Mac's part I really wish that they had
released the entire collection all over
the world now the immediate reaction
from my Facebook community for what
these lipsticks were like is that we're
all pretty much exactly the same neutral
shades you'll see in just a second that
they are definitely not the same these
two lipsticks so let's go ahead I'm
gonna wipe off my lip balm and we're
gonna go ahead and try on Laura shade
first so this is Laura's shade I will
put a picture of Laura wearing her shade
right there it is a very light nude
colored shade I'm not sure if this one
is for me look it's a little too
matchy-matchy with my skin tone it's
just a little too close to it so I don't
particularly prefer this shade on me by
itself it is really nice with a dark lip
liner and it's nice to top over other
lipsticks so I'm definitely gonna get
some good use out of it but I'm not the
biggest fan of this one on me by itself
now this is Gabriel shade as you can see
it is a little bit deeper
I know Gabriel said that he had a lot of
skin tones in mind when he created this
I do feel like this is a little bit more
wearable for me it's a little bit more
in my shade I should have it open to
show you what it looks like as I'm like
flinging it around I feel like he did a
great job making this like warm rusty
nudie brownish kind of color I do really
enjoy it I don't know if I like it with
this outfit and the
I shadow that I'm wearing but I do like
it on the whole and I think I'm gonna be
wearing this one a lot you may know that
Laura and Gabriel have become friends
through doing collaborations and things
with different brands together so I'm
gonna go ahead and show you what it
looks like to mix Gabriel shade with
Laura shade and this is actually my
favorite way to wear both shades is to
have them together
now this is one thing I want to say
about Matt's collaboration with these
for two particular youtubers I have met
a lot of youtubers big-name youtubers
through through hypsi if she has a lot
of events and I usually get to go to
their cocktail parties and I get to
mingle with lots of people I've also met
some bigger creators and IMATS and
things like that before they got rid of
letting bigger creators and kind of be
at high bets
so I've met a lot of people and I can
tell you that some of the people that
I've met the best way I can describe it
is they're extremely dismissive that's
the way I interpret it where I'll go up
and say hi you know it's nice to meet
you my name is jen blah blah and they're
like huh hi yeah and you know they kind
of walk away I can tell you Laura and
Gabriel are some of the nicest people
I've ever met Laura
Gabriel's hottie kathleenlights those
are some of the nicest people most
genuine down-to-earth people that I have
met through MC and the thing about
Gabriel specifically that I want to
mention is that when he started with
Ipsy he's one of the MC stylists he had
like 8,000 subscribers or something like
that now of course his channel is
getting huge but men even when Mac it's
decided they were gonna collaborate with
him he still only had like 20,000 maybe
30,000 subscribers and I think that was
a huge move on Mac's part to pick
Gabriel rather than picking an
influencer that had a bigger following
so I was I really admired that and Laura
I feel like is another great choice and
that she has a very fun bubbly just
relatable personality at least for me I
very much relate to her and I just feel
like they picked genuinely nice people
and that made me really happy to see
because you like to see good things
happen to good people and I want to
thank you so much for watching this
review I hope that you enjoyed it if you
did definitely make sure that you
subscribe so you can watch more of my
review video this is probably the least
detailed of anywhere few I've done in a
really long time but I'm on my way to
ukulele lessons so I gotta get going so
mad love to you and I will see you in a
video soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
