triple review no double review single
unboxing of the May June and July boxes
I have a lot of information to share
with you about boxycharm my opinions
about these boxes whether they were
worth the $21 price tag and if you're
not subscribed to boxycharm I will give
you some reviews so you can decide
whether you want to purchase these
products on your own without having a
subscription so if you're interested in
that
hang tight coming right up now never
heard of boxycharm before it is $21 a
month it is sent to me for review and
has been sent to me since their second
box ever so I've been getting back to
Tom for a very very long time and I am
very thankful but that never influences
my review at all boxycharm loves me just
the way I am and lets me be honest and
you're getting your Symone stinks in
this video in just a minute so let's go
ahead and start with the May box and
what we got we'll start with let's start
with the brush so the brush here this is
by crown brush and is one of their face
brushes I've been using this for
foundation and I really really like it a
lot I found that when I first started
using it ate a lot of foundation like a
lot of foundation was caked up in there
but once I got foundation caked up in
there I thought it worked really really
well but then every time you wash it you
kinda gotta go back to it letting it eat
foundation a little bit before it starts
performing well or I don't feel like
other brands like the motor brushes do
that I feel like they work from the jump
so that's kind of a negative about this
nothing on this brush at all though I do
really like it I love that it's got a
little bit of give to it but I don't
feel like it's going to snap and it
makes me very happy I'm very thankful to
have it a whirl
next is a brow palette by the brow gal
by Tanja crooks you get three brow
colors in here you get kind of a reddish
toned one here a warm color then you get
a cool light color I believe for blondes
and then the brunettes shade which is my
shade right there these can be used wet
or dry I personally prefer the dry
because I feel like the wet is a little
bit too bold for me I don't really like
the way this performs wet as far as the
way that it looks because I feel like
it's not a lot of it is sitting on top
of my brows instead of sinking down to
my skin if that makes sense and I just
not a huge fan of the way that it looks
on my brows but powder wise I think it's
better but it's still not my favorite
brow product that I've ever used it's
good I'm still going to use it but
eventually this is probably going to get
declutter to be completely honest
because I'm not in love with it we also
got the highlight and contour palette by
Eddy beauty in the beauty is another one
where I haven't really gotten a lot of
things that I truly enjoy from the brand
this is no different the contour shades
are very soft but I find that they kind
of blend out there a little bit it's
like I have to kind of take it on and
then blend it out just a tad bit or else
it'll blend away I just didn't have good
luck with these and I'm sad because I do
think the shades are very pretty it's
just it didn't really work for me so if
you have any tips for how you use this
what kind of brush you use I would love
to know some tips because I couldn't get
it to work for me it made me sad I
forgot to mention along with the brow
powder as he also got a spoolie that I
think I accidentally decluttered it was
just this bully it worked great it was a
spoolie it did everything that's really
supposed to do but I already have this
belief so I got rid of it but yeah
nothing magical about it you know it was
fully and then the last thing in here is
my favorite thing in the box is the
attempt to boxycharm liquid glow I'm
assuming this was made specifically for
boxycharm since it says box we Trump on
it I only critique about this is it is
quite messy underneath the capital if
you can see but it's oozing down on the
outside and I think that's kind of bluff
so I always feel like I need to wipe it
off and I just I need to make sure I
have something to wipe it off I don't
know but on the skin it is very pretty I
do find that it accentuates pores like a
lot of liquid highlighters do but I am
enjoying it I'm wearing it today and I
think it's very very pretty I love the
tone I feel like the tone can be used on
many many skin tones I think it was a
good choice of tone to put in the
boxycharm and I like it a lot I just
wish that it wasn't so messy lasting
Tyra's good tone is good performance was
good like a lot so was the may box worth
$21 to me no it wasn't I wasn't it I
wasn't a big fan of this box the only
two products that I liked were these two
and for me that's not a $21 thing for me
it's getting close to cinching off there
toward that $18.00 range for these two
but
not 21 so this box was kind of a Miss
for me okay moving on to the June box so
there's one thing in here that I have
not tried well three things in here that
I haven't tried but they're all
considered one item I haven't tried the
face masks yet okay I have a confession
to make those of you that been watching
my channel for a while you know how much
I hate sheet masks I think I'm becoming
a convert I think I like them a little
bit more than I used to them being able
to I'm able to tolerate them better
I don't like textures on my face it
really bothers me but I'm starting to
get better with sheet masks now that
I've been doing what decay my Korean
Beauty series I'm starting to be able to
tolerate them better so I'm actually
kind of excited about these the
ingredients look pretty good they gave
us three of them it's the hashtag beauty
secret hashtag I woke up like this and
hashtag primer which I've never seen a
mask marketed as a primer before so it
was really interesting so I usually do
my mask to the evening I don't really
think about doing a mask in the morning
I don't know it's kind of interesting so
there by bio bell and I'm very excited
about these next we have a highlighter
by artist couture and this is actually
not the highlighter that came with it
the one that came with it was bigger
than this one but I had the exact same
shade so I decluttered that one instead
of this one so that one of my reporters
could have the full size instead of the
smaller size but it's the exact same
shade this is by man named angel and his
youtube channel is Mac Daddy and he has
this brand called artist couture and his
diamond glow powder czar just that
they're very very very glowy they're
very glittery very sparkly they're
almost like if you use them as an eye
shadow like an over shadow but I
honestly like I was kind of expecting
like the bombs over shadows I really
like those a lot they're just as like
they're more shimmery than sparkly these
are just really sparkly if I was 22 and
going to the club I would love this
because I would put it right on my
collar bones and I put it on as a
highlight and I would love it but this
is just I don't have a place for this in
my life and it's nothing against this
product it's a very nice product it's
just it's not for me because I don't
really have a place to wear something
like this but if I had a place to wear
this I would like it but since I feel
like it's too glittery for everyday wear
it's just not something that I enjoy and
this is the second time that I filmed
this video I actually had two products
from this box
my face and I changed my makeup to shoot
my Jacqueline Hill review palette video
and now I'm refilling but the base of my
lips is this product this is the Oprah
shade Santana I have the milk makeup
holographic lip gloss over top of it and
the pairing of these two to me is
absolutely beautiful it's not
holographic it's iridescent but it's
still insanely beautiful
so these paired is a big yes I love over
liquid lipsticks they are relatively
transfer resistant they do dry down
which a lot of people really like I find
them to be a very nice happy medium
between too dry and too hydrating and
not transfer proof like they're kind of
in the middle they're not the most
transfer proof but they're not the most
hydrating either they're kind of like
happy medium they're the only thing
about this one that I don't like is I do
feel like I really need a lip liner with
this because I find it to be messy
around the edges so I apply it with a
lip I put a lip liner on and then I
apply it with a lip brush and says the
Josip applicator because the formula is
a little bit chunky so I the application
is a little weird but the final look is
really beautiful where down is great oil
is the enemy of these you definitely
want to if you're going to down you
definitely want to bring it to reapply
because it is going to come off anywhere
that whale touches it so they're not
perfect but I do really love over liquid
lipstick next the other product that I
did have on my eyes and I took it off to
put on this Jacqueline Hill look this is
a real her eye shadow be your own kind
of beauty and I wish I hadn't lost the
footage because I look actually came out
very nice this palette is really good
for people that don't need like a poppy
punch in the eye kind of look like where
you just look like you're just punched
with some soil you know like the foil is
just laying on there like this is a lot
more subtle it's not a super poppy look
the shades kind of blend into each other
they can be a little powdery depending
on the eye primer you use my favorite
shading here is actually the one that I
actually took a chunk out of and it's
the black one the black is actually very
very nice for a black but the other ones
are just kind of mediocre to me from my
personal taste but you like a more
natural look then this will probably be
something that you will enjoy I did find
that it did accentuate my
fine lines in my eyes Oh which I didn't
like it I think it had to do with the
way just a powder is laying on my eyes
and you know it's just kind of okay
mMmmm
and then finally we got a Lexy brush and
I love lucky brushes they are so soft
and wonderful this is the 640 Pro
precision taper I don't like this one
though I have to tell you I don't like
this one it's too floppy it's floppy you
want to go like this it just flops
okay I can't get the product on where I
want to do because it just do floppy it
just kind of goes all over the place and
I just can't not comfortable to use
either make it more dense and keep it
this length or make it shorter and and
keep it this dense because at this that
it's just too floppy it doesn't it
doesn't work it's not functional I'm not
a fan of this brush at all overall I
love Luxy brushes this one was a mess
for me so Forgione was it worth $21 to
me again I think I'm gonna have to say
no I'm too sad because I love bugs be
driving to people everybody John but it
just wasn't a hit for me IKEA IKEA I got
to tell you so the over liquid lipstick
I love I'm very happy to have this I
didn't own Santa Ana so I'm very happy
to I love the shade and I'm excited
about the face masks and I know if
you've been following me for a while
you're like your jaw's on the floor now
and you know people change seasons
change see things change like you
remember that song anyway so I'm totally
dating myself right now but yeah
feelings change and I'm excited about
these they look like a lot of fun the
marketing is super cute and I can't wait
to use them not a fan of the eyeshadow
palette not a fan of the highlighter and
not a fan of the brush so this these two
aren't really worth $21 for me again
hi close but no cigar before you write
off bossy Trump completely let me go
ahead and show you the July box I'm
actually very excited about the July box
one thing that I'm nervous about we're
going to try it anyway the project
beauty spray set and goes remember how I
was just telling you a minute ago about
how I don't like textures on my face
setting spray is one of those things
like I don't like like watch watch the
spray actually that wasn't that bad this
time when you spray it on my hand okay
so it doesn't the sprayer doesn't look
so bad
it looks like a relatively even
application what I don't like is when I
get like some parts are wet and some
parts are dry and some parts are didn't
get anything at all I hate that like an
uneven sprayer can kill a setting spray
for me let me just put some on I'm going
to suck it up and put some on I don't
like it I don't like it I don't like it
okay but I don't know if it works or not
because most people are not like me to
be like this half of my face is wet and
this half of my face is dry and maybe
that was application Oh we'll do it
again oh I don't like okay
I accidentally inhaled it that was
stupid okay mint Olympics itself
do not open mouth while the spray is
still in the air but we'll see whether
it actually works because that's what's
truly important not my little texture
phobia thing oh it feels terrible judges
one thing I'm really excited about is
the bareMinerals invisible light palette
this is a translucent powder duo I am a
huge bareMinerals fan I don't know if
you know this about me but I love
bareMinerals the format of this actually
reminds me of hourglass powders but I'm
really excited about these after
swatching as a highlighter reminds me of
a milder version of the artist couture
one so I'm curious to see how much I'm
going to like that and the matte one is
just very interesting so I'm really
curious to play with this I love the
packaging by the way what I'm really
excited about is this blink eyeshadow
palette ljust says it's in the
collaboration with boxycharm is the
electric eyes palette huh isn't that so
pretty like this shade right here this
shade right here whew so pretty
really excited about that when I touch
these it's like butter they are so nice
I've only ever tried blink like
eyeliners and mascaras I believe I've
never tried any eyeshadows by them so
I'm very excited to try this and cannot
wait to use it I'm going to have to
bring in some masks for like my base but
I'm looking forward using multiple
shades from this palette and a look I
think it's going to be really pretty so
I'll keep you posted on that
next we got from the Hello Kitty
collection from colour-pop the ultra
satin lip in the shade hello pretty
no.not hello pretty it's called walk a
diary hello pretty is just what it says
on it called the lost diary and it
actually looks very similar to the over
shade these are the two next to each
other so they're not the same the Hello
Kitty one is brighter but they're
similar in family color family I will
we tried one ultra satin lip and I liked
it better than their ultra matte lip but
I'm curious to try that one a little bit
more especially since it's summertime
and I like a brighter lip in the
summertime and finally we have the
Winkie luxe Universal brow pencil I
think it's called a uni brow but I don't
think it's made to create a unibrow I
guess you could if you wanted to you do
you girlfriend or boyfriend if you want
to make a unibrow with it that's all up
to you I don't think I'll be doing that
though I will be filling in my brows
with it
I like the teardrop shape it reminds me
of the benefit one with the teardrop
shape that I really really love I like
that it is not super creamy because I
still like the creamy formulas really
take up my brows this one feels a little
drier but it doesn't look like I have to
like scrub it on my brows and pull out
brow hairs to make it work so I'm
curious to try this I love the packaging
it's super cute I can't really figure
out what's going on here
with it it looks like Egyptian inspired
but I don't I don't really know a lot
about Egyptian history so I'm not going
to say that specifically but I think
this is the eye of horus I think that's
what the sign is called beyond your
force the reason why I think I know that
is because of like the search and find
iPhone apps the games where you have to
find things in the picture before time
runs out and I'm pretty sure the eye of
horus is one of the things that I found
I came how embarrassing is that that's
why I know what that is that's not
academic Jen that's that's not academic
that's embarrassing
but we're friends we can talk like this
I can tell you my embarrassing things
and we're all good this seems like it's
going to be worth twenty one dollars but
I don't know yet I haven't tried any of
it so make sure you subscribe so you
don't miss next month I'll also be
putting below last time I unbox
boxycharm in case you want to watch
another boxycharm unboxing by me and
thank you so much for watching mad love
and I will see you in a video soon
