review of the makeup geek showstopper
cream stains I have so much information
for you so make sure you stay tuned as
you may know not that long ago makeup
geek came out with a bunch of these new
cream stains if you are familiar with
makeup geek they were created the brand
was created by a woman named Marlena who
started out on YouTube and now she owns
this brand now the brand gets a lot of
hype desert-type for their eyeshadow
formula I have I also have their
highlighter formula really enjoyed that
but I've never tried any of their lip
formulas so I decided that this was
going to be where I was going to dive
into marlenas lip formula and now I
would not have had the money to purchase
these without the help of my friends on
the super chat I do a weekly chat every
weekend on Sunday well most weekends
almost every weekend on Sundays and
there is an option to donate to the
channel now this is for I have a budget
of how much I can spend on makeup a
month now these are the super chat pays
for product beyond that budget so things
that I wouldn't be able to purchase
without so scrolling right here are the
names of people that purchase these
makeup geek showstopper cream stains for
me so thank you so much to all of those
people for your donation without you
this video would not be possible so a
little bit about makeup geek as a brand
they are a cruelty free brand all
products are gluten free and most of the
products are vegan except for some of
them contain carmine none of the makeup
geek shows up or creme stains contain
carmine carmine is made from crushed
beetles so you don't have to worry about
any beetles on your lips for these
products they are made in the United
States and the only place you can get
these is on the makeup geek website
there are 18 shades available so I
thought well there was one oh they are
$12 each or you can pay a hundred and
$45 for the set I decided I wanted to
buy ten of them because I knew that
there were some shades that I would
never ever wear again after this video
was over and because it is a doe foot
applicator formula any bacteria that's
on my lips would be dipped back into the
product unless I use the lip brush
and I just decided I wasn't sure if I
had someone that I could pass them on to
that I so I just didn't want to waste
the super chat money on shades that I
knew I wouldn't be wearing personally so
I bought ten of them individually
instead now here's the sad story I
bought brought three of them to I mess
with me and somehow I have misplaced two
of them and that makes me really really
sad so I'm going to insert a picture of
me wearing grape vine in New York City
that is when I have a picture of and I
don't have the picture of era back I'm
really really sorry I don't have that
one but I can definitely speak to the
formula of them through this video so
the ones that I do have I have Walt's
Quick Step Foxtrot flamenco Mambo
cha-cha bunny hop and moonwalk so those
are the ones I'm going to be showing you
and lip swatches today either I left
them in my Airbnb or they've been
misplaced and I'll find them as soon as
I'm done filming this video because you
know that's how things happen so as far
as value these are a really good value
in comparison with other liquid
lipsticks they're on the less expensive
and when you compare how much product
you get with the price these are five
point five milliliter tubes and they're
two dollars and 18 cents per milliliters
so what I did was I went on the foreign
Ulta and I sorted their liquid lipsticks
by best rated and as far as the best
rated liquid lipsticks the only ones
that were less expensive than this per
milliliter with a Too Faced melted matte
liquefied lipstick those were a dollar
seventy six per milliliter and the NYX
liquid lingeries which were one dollar
in 82 cents per milliliter and these are
two dollars and eighteen one that were
more expensive with the Ofra at two
dollars and seventy three the Sephora
brand Kat Von D the Tarte quick dry
matte lip paints are three dollars and
38 cents hood a beauty at four dollars
and then we get into really expensive
land honest Talia's are six dollars and
15 cents per milliliter and then the
steelo's are eight dollars per
milliliter which is insane so you could
get about four of these for the same
value you could get one Stila which is
kind of crazy and you can get three for
the same value that you could get of the
honest ovule ones so there you go just
for finally honest Agia is more
expensive than the Giorgio Armani lip my
Joe and the Stila is more expensive than
the YSL vinyl cream lip stains just
little fun fact there I just find that
honest audience Kela it's so outrageous
how expensive they are promoter let's go
a little bit into the packaging here we
have this really nice tube I love how
sleek it is it is a clear plastic and
the plastic is see-through up here and
then here is that rubberized textured
top and then you twist it open there is
metal here might be fake metal I don't
know and you open it up and then there's
your doe foot applicator that goes
inside the different applicator is a
traditional dose what there's no weird
like spaces in it or anything like that
the plastic looks relatively thick
walled which also makes me really happy
so in case you drop it it most likely
will not break so now that we have gone
over a little bit about the product
let's go ahead and I will show you some
lip swatches so check those out or right
now
you
Oh
Oh
and
Oh
in total
I hope you enjoyed the lip swatches of
these eight shades now let's go ahead
into ingredient analysis and then we'll
go into my full review so like I
mentioned before there's no carmine
which is great for people that are vegan
there also is no talc and they are
paraben free one thing you do need to
know that's in here that some people are
very anti is petrolatum some people are
very anti petrolatum because they're
worried that it is not refined enough
from the petrel that it is that it comes
from there is a study linking the
petrolatum impurities to breast cancer
so there's no way to know how refined
the petrolatum is in these liquid
lipsticks but I would imagine Marlena
being Marlena that she would not allow
unrefined petrolatum where less refined
petrolatum into her products but I'm
just letting you know that that is
something that exists I would hope that
most makeup products would make sure
that their petrolatum is very refined
another ingredient means is the
preservative called phenoxyethanol that
some people are sensitive to also
there's a bunch of fragrance ingredients
in here and one thing I really
appreciate is a lot of products will
just say fragrance but Marlena breaks
down the different fragrances that are
in here which I thought was pretty cool
the mostly wood derived from things like
lemon rind and lavender and lemongrass
and things like that so I researched
every single one of these fragrances and
I found a common thread and that common
thread was that when these fragrances
are exposed to air sometimes they could
be allergens to some people so if you
have a problem with fragrance you
probably don't want to get these I will
tell you though that I don't feel like
they smell like anything like I feel
like they must have smelled really bad
or something that you had to use all
these fragrances to mask the scent
because they have a very mild liquid
lipstick II kind of smell but there's no
like sweet scent or citrusy scent or
anything like that it's kind of odd how
many fragrances there are in here for
not really having a good scent so again
if you have a fragrance allergy or a
perfume allergy where you're at not that
you're sensitive to the scent but that
you are allergic to fragrances and
perfumes where they give you an allergic
reaction you probably want to skip this
there are a couple of pigment concerns
we
a couple of the dyes that are in here
yellow 5 and red 30 they do have some
evidence of persistence and
bioaccumulation sigh meaning they build
up in your system but that would depend
on how much is in these products and how
often you use products with those
ingredients so there's a lot of factors
there to be considered red 30 is in some
of these it's banned in the European
Union and Canada rates it as expected to
be toxic or harmful but it's not in
every single one of the shape I'll tell
you which ones that these pigments are
in if you're concerned the yellow
pigment is in curtsy jitterbug
tango flamenco ChaCha and twerk and the
red pigment is in curtsy jitterbug tango
salsa and flamenco all the rest of them
do not have those dyes that those guys
freak you out you know which shades to
stay away from let's go ahead into my
full review so let's first talk about
the color selection I think she did a
really nice job with the color selection
as you can see here this is the full
range she did a great job of doing some
nudes some Reds some purples some Pink's
a lot of shades that people really enjoy
and then of course she throws the crazy
green in there for people that enjoy
crazy wild colors so well done to her on
the shades I think she did a great job
isn't the only thing that is really
missing here are those malls that I
personally really enjoy I personally
would have rather seen malls in Pink's
but that's just me being selfish because
that's what I personally enjoy I love
that there's a range from light to deep
so people of all different skin tones
should be able to find something that
they enjoy there's also a nice range of
warm to cool so I really think Marlena
put a lot of love into this color
selection I think she did a wonderful
job now as far as the formula all right
so you saw in the swatches that they can
apply pretty patchy but you can layer
them up and they end up being pretty
opaque these are suppose these are
called cream lip stain so I would have
expected them to stain a little bit
better they don't really stain and that
kind of made me sad in my heart because
I wanted them to stain I wore grapevine
and IMATS all day long and about halfway
through the day I went and used the
restroom and I looked in the mirror and
I went oh
and my lips were like they were like
peeling like the iBook all on the inside
it was gone and then it was really
opaque on the outside I mean that's
typical for liquid lipsticks to do
things like that but I didn't realize it
so I tried to layer it on top and it
layered really badly the formula started
crumbling and it just made me so sad and
I was fighting with this liquid lipstick
and the girl next to me started a
conversation about it and it was like oh
my gosh I think that's going to be the
big bummer for me on these is that the
wear down of it was really not good for
me and it made me really sad because I'm
always rooting for Marlena I'm always
rooting for independent brands and I was
sad I couldn't layer the product over
time I thought I could layer it up in
the beginning when the product was fresh
on my lips but once it wore down
I had trouble layering it and making it
look good it ended up being fine it just
took some work I will say something
really positive about these is they are
extremely transfer resistant if you were
drinking a cup of coffee or something
you may get a tiny bit of lipstick on
your coffee mug like right on the inside
but like I've been wearing this for I
don't know maybe
oh no 15 20 minutes and nothing
absolutely nothing so the transfer proof
part is fantastic I can't imagine how
difficult it must be to design a liquid
lipstick that does everything so she
nailed the transfer proof she nailed the
shade selection I wish the first
application was more of like a sheer
wash of color rather than a patchy kind
of mess I feel like you can't really
wear just one layer I feel like you
really have to wear two layers in order
for it to be opaque like some some
liquid lipsticks and lipsticks you can
wear one layer and it just looks like a
layer version of it but these you really
can't you have to build them up the full
opacity or else it just looks weird I
didn't find that it stuck to dry patches
my lips are just perpetually dry I
didn't feel like it really stuck to my
dry patches until it started wearing
down and that's when I just look like a
singing hot mess so the question is who
is this good for
well I can save it people of any skin
tone can wear them I wouldn't recommend
these for someone that has a longer day
where they don't have time to reapply
unless you get shades that are closer to
your natural lip color because I find
the ones that are close to your natural
lip color like this one here this one in
wall so is going to wear down a lot
better on me because it's not going to
look as different from my natural lips
in like a shade like flamenco that is
going to just fall apart and look
terrible through the day so if you don't
have time to completely remove your
liquid lipstick and reapply then I
probably wouldn't purchase these a great
way to quickly remove liquid lipstick is
to use any kind of oil if you have a
coconut oil-based lip balm you can put
that over top of your liquid lipstick
and wipe it with a tissue and it should
remove pretty easily I've done that with
these before and it works great so
that's a way that you can do it if you
really really like the colors and you
really want to try them but honestly I
can't really recommend these because I
don't think that they are a functional
product in the way that they wear down
except for if you get one that's closer
to your natural lip color then you
probably will be able to work with it
but other than that I honestly don't
really like them very much and it makes
me sad I'm going to do my best to try to
find some way to work with these so that
I can continue to use them because I
hate to waste super chat money on
something that I won't ever use again so
I am going to continue to try to work
with them and if I come up with any tips
for how to work with these better I will
leave that in the description down below
and I just update it if I find anything
if you don't see anything down there
I've just had no luck oh yeah I want to
thank you so much for watching this
video I hope you found it helpful if you
