hello my friends welcome to my review on
the brand madam glam now madam glam is a
company that is known for their nail
polishes but they also have makeup
products as well so they send me some
products to check out for review and
this is my honest opinion of these
products you my best to describe you
know how it worked for me and why I
think it worked that way so that you can
apply it to yourself and your own facial
features your eyelashes and things like
that to see whether it'll work for you
so let's go ahead and I'm going to go
ahead and show you my application of
these products as I described them so
the first thing that I put on is this
eyeshadow and this is called Smurf and
this is let me look here and one thing
you'll notice right away is this is
insanely pigmented like insanely
pigmented it is crazy how pigmented this
stuff is it goes on super super bright
it is very blendable the biggest
complaint I have about this is the
applicator the applicator is very very
difficult to use it leaves a ton of
fallout if you're not careful and I
obviously was not careful one thing you
can do is you can lay a tissue down on
your cheek to catch any fallout if you
like i did use Mac's Paint Pot in
painterly before I put on these shadows
so it did have a base to stick to
there's lots of different tips and
tricks you can use to get a product like
this to work if you are looking for a
super intensely pigmented I shadow this
may be a great one for you just be aware
of the fallout lasting time on these
shadows are really really nice really
really great it's just that powder
format does tend to get messy and it is
difficult to use some what if you are
not used to using powder eyeshadow the
other thing about this eyeshadow is it
is buildable as I kept going with the
look I it kind of went on you know
bright but then when I added another
layer on top of that and packed it on it
got even brighter it just very very
vibrant in shade so that's kind of the
deal with the eyeshadow the price on the
eyeshadows are 1795 each next up after
that I went into the madam glam
eyeliner and let me go ahead and show
that to you it is a liquid eyeliner so
you are going to have to dip and read it
and you're gonna have to watch how much
products goes on there in order to use
it now liquid eyeliners I used to love
liquid eyeliners until i discovered the
pen formula eyeliners the ones that are
like very very fine pointed brushes
really really like those are super easy
to use so I haven't used a actual liquid
eyeliner in a long time and let me tell
you the brush on this is very very thin
which makes it a lot easier to use it
also has a really nice fine point at the
end so if you're used to using liquid
eyeliner if you really like liquid
eyeliner this is a really really nice
one it does go on very very smoothly
winging it out is a little more
difficult for me because again I'm not
quite as used to using a liquid eyeliner
as I used to be before discovered the
pens so I'm a little bit out of practice
but if you were in practice this one's
really really good um the only thing is
is that by the end of the day this does
tend to flake off a bit so just be aware
of that that you may want to reapply you
know half way to three-quarters of the
way through the day you may start to see
a little bit of flaking so take this
with you in your purse very easy to
reapply if needed but it is it does go
on well and I love that it's a very very
fine pointed brush which is might makes
it much easier to use and build up your
thicker line as you need it now moving
on to the mascara now this mascara is
the long lash black mascara and when I
first started using this I did not like
it at all and I'll tell you why bristles
are very very spaced out so I felt like
it wasn't really combing through my
lashes and my lashes were clumping
together but the more I use this mascara
the more I liked it and sometimes
mascaras just take a little breaking in
time and this has just happens to be one
of those I do like this mascara I don't
feel like it gives me the length that I
need for my particular lashes I have
short sparse lashes if you have short
sparse lashes you may not this may not
be the mascara for you but if you have
naturally long lashes then this was good
this one's going to be pretty good for
you because I feel like it does give a
really nice amount of volume it just
didn't give me the length that I was
personally looking for in a mascara so
this can work for some people it was not
one that I would personally purchase is
because it might particular lash type
when I do wear this I when I first
started wearing it I did find some
flaking with it and again as I've used
the product more i use it yesterday i've
used it again today i have not noticed
any flaking or smudging at moving on to
the lip products the first lip product
that i have is classic matt in bare
truth it is a four point five gram
lipstick this is a very thick dry
lipstick it also has that lipstick snow
but it goes on extremely opaque really
really opaque so if you're looking for
that opaque very very nude or very very
pale lip then this is going to be a
really nice one for you but it does have
that lipstick smell so if that bothers
you you're not going to like it also if
you like don't like a dry formula you're
not going to like this formula what I
decided to do because I do feel like
this color is a bit pale for me what I
did was I paired it with the cinnamon I
put the cinnamon on top of it to give it
a you know a little bit more of a color
I have worn cinnamon by itself and I
really liked it as well this one is a
little bit creamy of a formula it's not
the matte formula so it's good it's not
quite as dry it's a little bit more
moisturizing but it does still have that
lipstick II kind of smell so beware of
that when you get these if you don't
like that you're not going to like these
but this one is a bit more moisturizing
where time on these lipstick is a
typical for a lipstick you are going to
have to reapply after eating or after
you know a few hours of typical where so
that is my review of madam glam you know
it's one of those things where not
everything works for everybody and some
things bother people more than others
and some things work great for somebody
that don't work great for other people
so I wanted to show them to you and give
you a thorough review so you can decide
for yourself whether these products
sound like something that would be great
for you so hopefully you found this
