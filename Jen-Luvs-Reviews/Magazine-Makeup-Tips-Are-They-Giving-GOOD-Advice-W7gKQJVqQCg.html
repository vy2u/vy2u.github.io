was published on February 13th of 2017
by Carli card
Delino and it's on cosmopolitan calm /
style - beauty / Beauty / how - to slash
a 6 - 6 5 slash makeup - Trish tricks -
every - woman - should - no I'm gonna go
ahead and try to copy and paste that
into the chat hopefully it'll let me so
that you all can click sorry I didn't
have these prepared ahead of time in the
bunks there we go all right yay
hopefully yes let me put it in there
good it was just a I'm not even going to
why I'm less prepared this morning I'm
just less prepared this morning and I
wish I was more prepared but we do have
an article to pick apart so let's talk
about these 17 life-changing makeup
tricks I love the hyperbole you know the
the over-exaggerating
some of these articles but it's it gets
clicks man it gets clicks let's learn
about him
oh we've talked about these before we
did about makeup hacks but what we never
really talked about whether they work or
not I think we just tested them you know
I've read articles like this before
number one turn a pencil eyeliner into a
gel formula with the help of a match or
a lighter
if you ever done that where you take a
pencil either a lip liner and eyeliner
and you heat it up with like a hairdryer
or a match or a lighter and makes it
more creamy I feel like that one's kind
of outdated unless you're buying like
stuff from like maybe the Dollar Tree
that hasn't really been updated in
Formula I don't think that most pencils
nowadays with their formulas would would
handle that very well because they're
they're made a lot softer than they used
to be so I don't recommend that one more
I think you're gonna win your your
eyeliner they're actually using an OCC
eyeliner there which is probably not a
good idea
Tracey says yes i melted eyeliner in
eighth grade yes at least my mom used to
buy the hardest pencils and do this Oh
Elise is fabulous too
at least ha Florrie all through high
school my mom did that City sounds yeah
I do feel like it's kind of out of out
of you know what you can really do now
tab it's easier to buy gel pencils
exactly and you can get softer pencils
at much less of a cost now I think that
one's really outdated I do trace
the red Maybelline stick yes it's me it
turn into gels that is so not true it
will wear off like any other liner I did
that in the 90s yeah absolutely it was
written in 1919 2017 so about it you
know I think I said November of 2017 and
it's currently if you're watching this
with replay June of 2018 so I think that
one's a little out of date let's go
ahead and head to the next one because
that one's that one's not cool all right
cover your eyelid with white liner to
make any eyeshadow pop I think that
that's a good thing
have you ever used the NYX pencil in
milk I think that's the most famous one
to put on the lids I do have just
letting you know I would love to get
this video out for you on Tuesday on
tomorrow if I can but I'm feeling it's
gonna be Tuesday the Crayola products I
tried using this all over my lid I'll
swatch it for you so you can see but the
full review is coming on Tuesday yeah
NYX milk is better I'll give you a hint
but I do have a big reveal about these
products I don't know if anybody's
revealed yet if anybody else reveals it
before I do I'll be sad but I do have a
big reveal about these products but yeah
as far as I'm applying a white base down
to the eyes before I shadow yes that
absolutely 100% works the NYX pencil a
milk is amazing for that at least for me
I've heard that it does crease on some
people if you're finding that creases on
you try using less try just putting a
few dots and blending out and building
it up Joe Smith says Jay Kissin just did
a video I did watch IJ kisses review she
did an excellent job I do like her very
much yeah he's like oh god there's
Crayola products yeah that's about right
yeah but I do have some really hoping no
one no one figures this one thing out
before I before I can announce it
because it's kind of crazy yeah
James Charles adore human Haven I saw
that he did one oh I thought he did one
he wasn't holding up the the products
that he was holding up an actual crayon
box EEP your soul milk creased and faded
badly on me oh no I'm sorry
try using a little bit less but yeah it
definitely will make eyeshadow pop that
one I totally totally agree with
absolutely the only thing is is be
careful with depending on your skin tone
I've seen women of color using the white
pencil and then using like lighter
colors and I feel like like you have
like I would definitely recommend if
you're a woman of color to are a person
of color to watch people of color using
it that are like really talented so you
can see how they use a white pencil
because I feel like the way that someone
of my skintone uses a NYX pencil and
someone of a deeper skin to and using a
white pencil I feel like that the tech
the shadows you layer over top is
different I think it kind of has to be
different so definitely watching
tutorials I can't give you good advice
because I don't have experience like
that but I definitely recommend watching
some of those I used to have a friend
let me talk to him forever I don't think
she makes videos anymore her name's Tina
excuse me oh my gosh I'm a mess makeup
by Tina I know she used to use the NYX
pencil in milk a lot she created some
gorgeous looks I haven't seen her and
forever though I don't think she makes
videos anymore okay
let's move on to the next one oh here we
go
um Cindy says try the NYX in a pot in
the white great advice and then Steph
says actually color pop zero zero white
concealer is a decent primer nice Steffi
Marie I have the soft ochre Paint Pot
from a mint from Mac and helps make my
eyeshadow pop but I don't know about
losing him in your lower lashline but
it's great for the lid awesome my shirt
by the way is philip defranco he's a
youtuber
it's his merch if you type him philip
defranco merch in the search he should
be able to find it on google all right
number three sorry I'm not as smiley as
I normally am I'm really not feeling
very well draw your cat eye first and
then film the open space for a perfect
winged liner application every time
um I think it just depends on you and
your personal preferences they have the
person drawing the outside line first I
wish I could show you right now the
person drawing the outside line first
and going across and then drawing like
the triangle part I don't know I think
you have with winged liner I think it's
really important to play with different
ways because everybody's eye shape is
very different everybody's eye shape
will handle a winged liner differently
because we're all different so I think
that it's important to figure out what
works for you for me i line my upper
lash line and then I just pull it out
just a little bit toward my temples and
then I draw the little triangle and then
I fill it in that's what I personally do
so
ah ZYX the learned I would buy Jade
marks thank you we used to have some
what's going to cut March a while ago
but we only think it's only notes on
line anymore it was on CafePress
I'd rather do some merch somewhere else
anyway I don't even think I ever like
made any money off of that at all no
that's the big reason for merch but it's
so overpriced over at Kathy pres so
overpriced I'd rather have marches less
expensive chase with hooded eyes all of
these I'll internships usually suck yes
I remember my friend cam from work when
I used to teach she she has hooded eyes
and she was like Jade you have to hang
my wig and I was like the best advice I
can give it just start really small and
figure out how that works for you and
also YouTube tutorials it's the best
advice for hooded eyes and and winged
liner a CafePress is definitely a racket
Catherines adjust me or whenever I draw
my cat eye on my eyelashes get in the
way of application so badly I always end
up destroying my wing a few times before
I getting something okay
yeah minor lashes are so short they
never get in the way of anything but I'm
sure you are not alone I'm sure you're
not alone alright let's go ahead and go
to the next one so for this before we do
that for this one I feel like it really
just depends on you and your own eyes as
far as drawing your cat eye first or
your wind line or first I wouldn't
really call that a cat
we'll call that winged liner I don't
think that will create perfect winged
liner every time I think that just
depends on you oh my gosh this one
excuse this I did this this is terrible
this does not work well at all number
four use a spoon to create the perfect
winged liner no no don't do that doesn't
work it's terrible it's a terrible
terrible idea and you can even tell in
the photo if you're following along you
can even tell in the photo that she
didn't do like the first line she lines
it against the against the back of the
spoon and then she like the the handle
part spoon and then the second picture
is the the bowl part of the spoon and
then she lines it against the curve
there but then when she removes it the
liner that she's filling in as a
completely different shape it's actually
kind of teardrop shaped so I don't know
how I guess maybe she flipped it the
other way or something I don't know but
but using a spoon does not work unless
you are very very very talented so she
puts the the back of the spoon here to
make the line and then she puts the bowl
part here to make like a curve it
doesn't work don't do that
bad idea really bad actually nope haha I
tried it and I just can't get it I think
it's just practice practice practice
with the spoon you tried it or you just
tried it in general what is on my face
oh my gosh I'm such a mess I swear
Steph spoons are for ice cream totally
agree totally agree
it's me sometimes magazines are just
peddling garbage misinformation just to
write something yes and when I was
looking for articles for this morning I
was over on like the last time we did
chat we did an article and then had all
these links in the article for more
articles I swear every one of those
articles was exactly the same it didn't
matter that they were different articles
it was the same thing over and over and
I have to I have to find it because it's
so funny let me go back until to the
jack this was hilarious I've I'm pausing
for a second if you don't like live chat
format where
I'm like all over the place you're
really not gonna like this video because
I am an extra all over the place but
this is really funny I promise okay so
I'm about to the chat from last week
okay it was 13 makeup myths you should
stop believing which was actually very
interesting to dissect but then when you
go to that article it's like tips for
making for anti-aging
you know tips for photos tips for
whatever and they were all the same
okay well flawless fit flawless flawless
skin with these pro makeup tips open
that one up okay I'm gonna open up let's
see this one is tips for looking younger
and then the next one is flawless makeup
tips for helping you look less tired do
you see how these are all very unique
topics note 19 no no makeup makeup
tricks okay
look amazing in photographs I am not
even kidding you
let me read down these things okay so
the first one which is the flawless skin
with these six easy makeup tricks okay
these are the tips I'm not even kidding
start with prep battle dark circles with
concealer private way your pores
disguise spots even out your skin tone
and then it says fake sleep you can use
you know highlighters and stuff like
that so those are the tips on that one
the next one is makeup artist tricks to
look younger okay though this one was
actually a little bit better it says
don't be afraid of color apply
moisturizer before foundation oh wait
this one was actually pretty good I'm
gonna skip that one because that was
different okay so eight flawless makeup
trips to help chick juice to help you
look less tired start with a clean slate
so wash your face use a tinted
moisturizer target under eye circles set
your concealer add color to the eyes
like this isn't to make you look less
tired this is just makeup put them on
your makeup dip into the bronzer add
color to the cheeks bring focus to the
lips I mean like really like that's an
article no makeup tricks to make
look wait no make 19 no makeup tricks to
make you look naturally gorgeous start
by exfoliating and it just goes through
a makeup routine add hydration prime
your skin it's a SWAT foundation for
tinted moisturizer pick the right
foundation blend your blend your makeup
it's like really define with bronzer
fake your glow use a highlighter I mean
you get the point I've been going on and
on for a minute but it's basically every
article is just a makeup routine like a
typical makeup routine but they've named
it something crazy it's just so funny I
find that hilarious but I guess they
have to write about something right it's
really really weird Tracy says I think
maybe they advertise for the next
younger generation maybe yeah Katherine
yeah pretty much common sense exactly
and I was like I was having trouble
finding articles for this morning lisa
says sounds like makeup 1-1 for
beginners yeah and it was like every
article was like that look oh my gosh
this is terrible what am I gonna chat
about this morning all right so anyway
the spoon thing doesn't work moving on
to the next one draw a slanted hashtag
at the outer corner of your eye and then
blend it for an instant smokey effect so
you know like the pounds we call it the
pounds and bull us older folks used to
have it on the phone hit pound no yes no
so or the hashtag depending on your
generation I feel like that is it works
so you use a like an eyeliner pencil so
they're using Brown here and you draw a
hashtag and then you blend it and it you
know blends it out but really you don't
have to draw a hashtag it's just you
know throwing a little bit of eyeliner
there and blending it
I feel like using eyeshadow is much
easier than using a creamy pencil that's
just me I feel like that's much easier
but you know I don't know I think like
it's too much
tic-tac-toe there you go yeah I just
think it's too much it's too much to
draw all that and then have to blend it
out because then you have to blend it
out evenly and that's just annoying
sarah says these articles were people
like my mom a lot more makeup ever and
just started to at 58 she came to me and
said what is bronze our oh how cute
Shana says what about hemorrhoid cream
on to the eyes that's stuff from what
I've read is so bad for your skin
like overall it's not a good idea
especially something medical I think
it's kind of important to use it for its
intended use who do katana is really big
on using things for not their intended
to use and then they go viral and then
people end up using these products for
these crazy things
it's made creamy pencil can skip if you
don't want a smooth lid eyeshadow all
the way yeah absolutely absolutely
alright let's go ahead to the next one
the same thing with the spoon use the
same spoon to avoid mascara marks on
your upper eyelid so what she's got is
she's got her mascara wand and she's
putting on her mascara and then she's
got a spoon like this so she's got the
bowl of the spoon here and she's using
that to protect her her lid the problem
with that is the spoons at least for me
and my lashes the spoons are too wide
I've tried this too the spoons are too
wide so when you go to put your mascara
on I have trouble getting them like
wiggling and maneuvering the mascara
while I'm holding the spoon in a way
that actually gives me longer lashes
they do make tools longer lashes that
was I was trying to say I'm just stuff
did it well I'm trying to get my mascara
on so they do make tools that help
protect your lid I wouldn't say using a
spoon as that is the most effective way
and you can try it if you've tried it
and it works for you I'd love to know as
Steph says again spoon ice cream yeah
Elise says you use a business card to
protect my some mascara when I can
remember I'm a business card is probably
more functional because then it bends to
the shape of your eye instead of this
weird funky bowl shaped spoon Elise is
genius I think I think that's much much
better yeah lash card exactly Allen
weren't they selling those for a while
wasn't it a thing
lash cards I apologize if you're hearing
me sip and gulp I'm not doing that on
purpose but I need my met I need my
coffee man I've got to have my coffee
but yeah spoon I just feel like they're
just trying they're trying really hard
it's not working okay I would love to
know your thoughts on this one because
I've never tried this and I'm really
curious about whether this works I've
never tried this add saline solution to
a flaky mascara formula to rewedding and
par probably part of the reason why I've
never tried this is that I only keep my
mascaras for three months it's one of
the few things that I'm really good at
keeping up with when it comes to makeup
everything else I pretty much let live
forever but mascara is I'm really good
with throwing away for three months
after three months so I'm curious to
know if you've tried that I need to know
Monica Jenn how are you feeling not well
thank you for asking though not well my
throat hurts every time I talk my throat
does not feel good but I'm making it
through we're gonna push through we're
gonna do it I've never had a job that I
didn't show up to because I wasn't
feeling good
well that's not true when I'm really
like really really bad I stayed home but
I a little cold is not going to stop me
from doing Chad okay let me scroll up
okay love Shelby I could never put any
of those medical creams for primer on my
skin would be screaming yeah better off
red oh she says no don't ad that stuff
to your mascara really Shauna says it
works Kim says didn't really work on my
waterproof mascara
Elise says no bad bad bad ADA my mascara
is 3 years old girlfriend you have got
to choose and you're gonna give yourself
I infected um once you have a eye
infection no ADA don't do it you have to
have to get a new one just get them
drugstore water just go go get some
awesome Jordana lash Jordana best lash
extreme or some essence lash princess
spend yourself your 3 bucks or five
bucks or 4 bucks and throw that baby
away
and you'll be surprised at how well it
works compared to your three-year-old
mascara you will be very surprised Zoe I
would be so scared to try to revive on
mascara because my eyes are so sensitive
Cathleen I've never tried that but I
have a drop of face oil in it and it
worked well that's interesting
Jenny I use ISO dodecane or inglot
duraline or a similar product and you
where do you get just plain ISO do
decane I didn't know you could just buy
that I have inglot duraline I haven't
even used it yet I bought it in IMAX
when I was hanging out with Georgia
Harris and makeup struggles and I
haven't even used it yet on anything I
just have it just in case I need it Jen
Oh Sara I already read jimmies sometimes
I wonder are people just putting these
ideas to laugh at us like let's see if
they try this definitely possible
definitely possible anything I've tried
and it saves it for me a few days gotcha
Michelle says no I'm not going to do
that if it's over that I it goes not
taking a chance that makes sense and
they maybe I love the shirt thank you
it's my felt DeFranco shirt I love my
Philip DeFranco shirts I have two of
them I've only worn this in one video
though so I figured I would wear it
again today
okay so let's review unboxing in reviews
yes and mascara things works especially
and with the lash paradise' well that's
good to know
so it seems like there's a lot of mixed
feelings about this alright this is
another one I think is a bad idea I
don't know if you think it's a bad idea
but I think it's about it you this is
number eight hit your eyelash curler
with a hair dryer to heat it up so your
lashes curl easier okay number one I
don't use lash curlers anymore because
they freak me out because I've pinched
my skin on my eyelid so many times and
also my lashes are so short that it
doesn't really seem to make a difference
on my lashes they're too short they
don't even they don't it doesn't do
anything for me
but what freaks me out about this is
that if it's a metal eyelash curler you
could heat it up so bad that you could
burn your skin because your main thing
about your using metal and you're
heating the metal and then putting it on
your skin
aren't you gonna burn your eyelid like
that just seems like a bad idea oh here
we go it says to do it hit the eyelash
curler with your blow-dryer until it
heats up wait
so cool slightly but it's still warm you
want to make sure not to burn your
eyelid there you go but does it work
that's the question that's what I want
to know from the collective brain does
it actually work okay Kendall says no no
no no no no no no no no Nina says brah
what if you burn your eyelashes off I
agree with you Mita Jessica says I curl
it curled them but it was very
uncomfortable to the skin I would
imagine Kathleen that idea just scared
me I'd be afraid to burn my lashes off
I'm totally with you dancing glitter
squirrels which is possibly one of the
best YouTube names ever I believe in
this I used to have a heated eyelash
curler I got from Walgreens but never
tried it this way I would add you a
heated eyelash curler is better than
that because I would imagine a heated
eyelash curler is tested and made at
least she would hope to only heat up to
a certain amount and then you know then
you would use it where you have no
control over this hack you've no control
I mean it's you ha ha Kendall says
doesn't work by the time it's cool
enough to put near your eye it's not
warm enough to be effective interesting
Colleen use the hairdryer to blow up
your left your lashes up after you apply
mascara it curls them and they stay that
way for a long time wow that's
interesting so like you just let go like
this like sometimes what I'll do is I'll
just kind of push my lashes a little bit
after I put my mascara on or like when I
put false lashes on I'll just give him a
little push at the base to try to get
him to curl up a little bit yep Elise is
leaving bye Elise no I just realized my
face is totally blown out I'm sorry I'm
not fixing it at this point we're
halfway there chat we're just gonna let
the blown out face live and plus I don't
really get up it's not sit here yeah
Megan says I touch at first to make sure
it's not hot got you I hear you Sara
doesn't use eyelash curler she's afraid
she's gonna rip her eyelashes out yeah I
hear you all right let's see what the
next one is next one number 9 dust on
translucent powder in between coating on
mascara to plumb up your lashes
I'm not a fan of this one the powder on
the lashes thing I did a long long long
time ago I used to do like hack videos I
used to do like Pinterest act it was
called Pinterest Busters and I use baby
powder which was the hack to use baby
powder on your lashes to see if it would
if it would adhere to the mascara and
make the lashes look longer and it
didn't work I feel like this is one of
those things where I think it's gonna
depend on the mascara and also you have
to be careful not getting the
translucent powder in your eyes because
that could irritate some people's eyes
why is my film going off over there I
don't know what's going on I'm scared
though hopefully everything's okay
because I left my phone over there and
tap text me when something's going wrong
hope everything's all right so but yeah
I think this one's gonna depend on the
mascara and I would definitely recommend
being very careful what she's doing is
she's got a I'm like a fluffy blending
brush the winning I shadow brush she got
her eyes closed and she's tapping the
powder on top of her lashes and I don't
know I can imagine it might work for
some people with some mascaras but I
don't want to do that one
Oh tab says it's not her okay good yeah
Amy says company clump clump yeah
because it's not gonna um it's it's I
don't know I would imagine it would
might add more volume but it is not it
has not worked well for me we're gonna
call you my my tie too many vowels I
can't get it well you're gonna call you
my nai powder on the lashes makes it
spider like the old lady in the
Emperor's New Groove
there you go that's awesome Carrie says
nope I wear contacts and I love clots so
I would more than likely get that powder
under my contacts that's there you go
Susan I don't even like this thickening
mascaras with a powdery first coat in
the liquidy second coat
yeah area meet I just watched Jackie on
a video a while ago where she
recommended using black eyeshadow
instead of powder that's interesting
just you just got to be careful you
don't get it here because that could
make a huge mess
Valerie hi Valerie sometimes I get I
shadow powder on my lash
and then I put on my mascara it doesn't
work gotcha Denise says irritates the
eyes gotcha Nicole hi Nicole and Nicole
from uni Nicole is here does not work
use eyelash primer powders too
inconsistent yes absolutely absolutely
and I think there's really good eye
shadow primers out there there's one
that oh my gosh what's it called
I remember hearing about it from Emily
Noelle eighty-three a long time ago it's
a drugstore one I want to say it's by
L'Oreal and it's two-sided there's a red
one and a blue one I know some of you
are gonna know what I'm talking about
it's really really good
so one side is the primer it's white
it's a white eyelash primer and then the
other side is the mascara and it's so
good I know someone's gonna know what
I'm talking about so you put the white
eyelash primer on first and then you put
the mascara on and it definitely works
really really well for lengthening the
lashes but they do sell just regular
white like the lash primer if you're her
into spending a couple bucks I'm pretty
sure it is
L'Oreal but is it Alma I don't know but
but anyway so if you're just spending a
couple bucks the Lancome one is really
really really good really good man I
can't remember what it is but if you
look at if you look at the grocery store
there's a red one or the maybe not the
grocery store that's where I've seen as
a grocery store it's either red or blue
I forget the difference but the there's
a you know white cap on one side and
then the red or blue cap on the other
side I don't know my lash primer is not
black let's be unboxing the reviews I
don't know why yeah I'm not sure you
would imagine that it should be but I
guess maybe so it's not so harsh on some
people I don't know who knows okay this
is something I haven't tried let's move
on to number ten apply eyelash glue to
false lashes with the tip of a clean
bobby pin I would imagine that would
work but I think that's an extra step I
personally when I use eyelash glue on
eyelashes I just use the tip of the of
the the whatever it comes out of and
then you know I if I put too much on I
just kind of spread it with the tip of
the thing I feel like a bobby pin is
extra work
I don't see any reason to use a bobby
pin like to put the glue on the bobby
pin and then spread that that's too much
by the time you get done with that
that's like an art project but I'm gonna
get done with that it's gonna be driest
that's annoying no too much work too
much work
waste of time Sabbath's tab says because
we've been taught that primers are white
or light I don't know yeah I don't know
either
Susan well these chests continue when
you go on vacation no unfortunately no
because I don't know if I'm gonna have
internet we're gonna be in a lot of
campgrounds and stuff and we might not
have internet so I can't guarantee we're
gonna have chats
Wow the the lighting looks so much
better when I have my coffee mug up here
Stacey says I used to use toothpicks I
would imagine that would take forever
with a little tiny toothpick tip imagine
that would take forever Michelle I tried
the bobby pin and it doesn't work any
better than using the tip of the glue
container yeah exactly
Nicole says I now love the duo black
eyelash glue do you really I've heard
not-so-good things about that I bought
it and I never used it I lost it I like
bought it and promptly lost it and I
never used it and somewhere around here
I don't know where it is but that's good
to know that you like it I've heard that
it it like is really difficult to get
off of the lids but I've never used it
I'm good to know that you like it though
oh wow we've got we've got a butt head
that just was blocked nice thanks tab
even they're weird how do these creepers
find my chat like how does this even
happen we're like these really creepy
weird people to find the chat like you
can you search for people that are live
right now or something
oh no it's so weird actually in a moment
at work my lash and in a moment at work
my lash and lifted and all I had was a
was a closure and my glue I put a tiny
bit on on the flower pick and put it on
the lash and save my last oh wow that's
cool Katrina there's a bobby pin trick
work for winged liner I would imagine
not I don't think for a winged liner for
me the best there's two two things two
options that I feel like work best for
wind liner
one is to use a ped liner that has a
very fine tip such as a Kat Von D tattoo
liner in trooper the NYX epic ink works
really well for me even though I know it
doesn't work for everybody
Physicians Formula makes a nice one
Stila makes a nice one Jessie's girls
still if you can find that one I think
that's a rite aid only brand or you can
buy that online
it's just something really fine that
that it bends to your lid so like the
marker tips the ones that are really
hard those are more difficult because
the the pen ones the ones that have like
a brush tip they they kind of Bend as
you put them on so because they're
bending there it's easier for them to
apply the product without skipping and
then just pulling or not pulling but
like holding your eye like this I'm just
giving it a little little short little
flick to so that it gets that point at
the ends so that's one way the other way
is with a gel liner to use a very thin
angled liner brush very thin like you
don't talk about like though they're
like almost rectangular but they're cut
at an angle and they're thin dip that
into the gel make sure you wipe off any
excess and do the same thing and just
give it a little flick at the ends it
just takes practice really and truly it
just takes practice but those are those
are my favorite ways of applying a wing
alright let's go on to number eleven for
long lasting lip color swipe on your
shade lay a tissue of your mouth and
then dust translucent powder over to set
the color I have never tried that where
okay let me repeat that so you put your
lipstick on you put a tissue over your
mouth and then you put translucent
powder over the tissue and it's supposed
to set the color I would imagine that
that would not work I don't know does
that work have you tried that does that
work I I don't know Georgina says it
works but it makes it mad Michelle Anne
says it works Stephanie says it works
Wow Lisa elders had this tip in a video
interesting Rosie I tried that tissue
trick before it didn't work but hey
maybe I did it wrong for nose maybe my
says this is a bunch
nonsense the tissue powder is is just to
make us and looking dumb I swear mama
berry this does work I use the Kleenex
day mat and I think it works swimmingly
well there you go
and let's review on boxing your reviews
as it works - nice very cool Steph says
it works if Steph said it there we go
Michelle says you take half a tissue and
it lasts longer what I can't go Jenni it
works for any cream makeup well there
you go
Alma says the Tyra Tyra Banks had this
hack on her show
Jim janae says that it dried your lips
out in her opinion well that's good to
know
Oh anna says it's important to have a
single layer of tissue see this is why
the collective brain is amazing
yeah Marilyn says split the tissue into
it's a thinner tissue so like separating
it out like if it's like a two-ply make
it a one fly
yeah thin tissue everybody's saying thin
tissue that's a that might crumble the
lip color though if you use too much to
go very lightly there you go hello Tina
alright let's go to the next one we've
got number 12 mix loose pigments with
salt or petroleum jelly to make your own
custom lip gloss so alright we are like
lip balm so you can miss the next loose
pigments with lip balm the the thing
that I would say about mixing a loose
pigment with a lip balm or petroleum
jelly I have done this is to make sure
that the eyeshadow is lip safe in case
you do not know there are some pigments
that are not lip safe if you look at the
eye shadow formula you're looking for a
ferric ferrocyanide you're looking for
chromium oxide greens you're looking for
ultramarines those are the three big
ones that are not lips safe I haven't
researched to find out why they're not
lip safe but from what I've read it has
something to do you know from different
sources I haven't read the actual
studies but I've read that it has
something to do with them not being able
to be ingested that it's bad for you to
ingest a lot of it you may if you just
have one lip balm or whatever one
lipstick that you do this with it
probably won't affect you very much but
if this is something you're going to use
on a regular just be very careful of
those three those three pigments
it's better to be safe than sorry you
know it's only something I would have to
research more like how I just researched
with the eye pigments and finding out
that the FDA says they're not eye safe
but the EU says that they are eye safe
so I mean the FDA definitely can say
things are bad when they're not bad and
also can say things are good when
they're actually bad so I don't
necessarily trust the FDA completely as
far as what they approve for our lips
safe eye safe all of that but I'd rather
be safe than sorry and there's so many
eye shadows out there that don't have
those pigments in them so I would
definitely recommend being careful of
that just as a precaution unless you
find out from somewhere else that it's
okay to use not what sip lips safe I
shadow is on the list just be careful
with that I know a lot of people have
trouble with petroleum jelly they say
that they don't like petroleum jelly I
used to be one of those people that was
very anti petroleum jelly but the more
research I've done on it the less I have
a problem with petroleum jelly people
see petrol and may think gasoline but
it's a completely different substance
than petrol what once it's been
processed so much for the petroleum
jelly Steph says if you want to make a
unique color editorial Halloween or
whatever okay yeah because it can really
be very very pigmented it can it
definitely does not look necessarily
like like a natural lip color just
depend on how much pigment you use and
how much petroleum jelly you use so just
be careful with that
Oh Amy says ultramarine is a neurotoxin
can cause brain damage it's why van Gogh
went crazy and cut off his ear he was
ingesting Prussian blue Wow ah Amy holy
moly
Wow yeah that's why I said be better be
safe than sorry I need to do more
research on it just so I have that in
like actually like I want iLike to put
my eyes on things but III trust that you
know what you're talking about Amy but
that's crazy yeah Wow
so ultramarine is a neurotoxin
meena honestly I'd rather just buy matte
lipstick then do this issue thing my
hair yeah Wow
thanks Amy Steph says Amy as a holder of
a bachelor's of Fine Art this is true
Wow
Stacy says why would you not just buy a
lip product these hacks are like they
were sick in a bunker from the 50s and
have to do makeup glam oh yeah well I
think it's just people want to do
something new and do something fun and
you know sometimes creating something
new was fun I guess
wow that's crazy Bobby says that's why
they say to keep away from children wow
that's crazy jo says I thought he was
bipolar I was not an art student AJ says
former art student here Amy's right
everybody saying yeah Kranthi Ruben says
I thought he had tetanus I think it's I
think you're trying other your spawn
tetanus tinnitus tinnitus maybe Wow
interesting history Shelby says hips
history minor yeah hi Nikki I mean it's
tough says I mean most things are that
synthetic now yeah absolutely and it may
be a synthetic like they may be using
more synthetic we're back in his time it
was more natural Wow
Esme we're talking about that one of the
hacks were reading about with adding
eyeshadow make a lip color so oh crafty
one says tinnitus yes ringing in the ear
gotcha
well definitely be safe for putting
pigments on your lips that are not lip
safe then let's let's go with that
remember okay let's time again more time
for three of them ferric ferrocyanide
ultramarines chromium oxide or chromium
hydroxide grains
it's either chromium oxide green or
chromium hydroxide grains they're
slightly different but they're neither
of them are lipstick holy moly yeah be
careful with that all right this is one
that I use all the time number 13 I use
this all the time perfect your Cupid's
bow by drawing an X on your upper lip
first as a guide I do this all the time
it works really great for my lip shape I
think again this is gonna be something
that is gonna depend on your lip shape
because some people don't really have
a strong Cupid's bow here but I do so
you draw an X right here on the line of
your Cupid's bow and then fill-in works
amazingly it is one of the best hacks
I've ever seen online it works great for
trying to make that make that line nice
and stiff on the Cupid's bow
definitely definitely works Bobby says
that does not work on lips yeah I think
that it's just one of those things where
you have to see like I don't know if you
can see it but my Cupid's bow I
definitely have one Ashley says yes I do
that everyday of a really nice Cupid's
bow nice Shelby I used that I every time
I wear lip product yes and then AJ says
the same thing and she cuz she has a
very defined Cupid's bow Stacey says
I've next to no keep his bow but I kind
of like that yeah I mean it's worth a
try worst case you wipe it off try again
Mel says my Cupid's bow is obnoxious
really works well with a lip liner first
there you go nice Bobby says I'm strong
Cupid's bow but it's uneven I guess you
could probably try to like even it out
that way oh my gosh my throat is on fire
we've got 15 minutes left I've got this
and then I'm gonna stop talking I should
have made tea instead of coffee but I
like coffee so much better alright but
yes that one is definite yes love that
one number 14 conceal dark circles and
puffy eyes the right way by creating a
triangle with your cover-up okay so this
is something that I feel like can be
overdone okay is the triangle concealer
I Nicole I'm sick I don't have allergy
I'm definitely sick so I feel like if
you're very young and you don't have
under-eye creasing and you don't have
any fine lines on your face you might be
able to go full triangle out with some
shape tape or something you know like
full like down here and it's it
brightens the under eye that's that's
the purpose of it is is for brightening
I don't think it's if concealing for me
really should be spot you know looking
for where you have discoloration and
concealing that part but the
triangle thing for me is for brightening
the under eye which can look very very
beautiful it's a kind of contouring you
know you want to brighten them the high
points so it brings this part forward
and you want to you know darken and and
contour you know with darker colors to
make things look sink in to make it look
like a shadow that's why people do the
cheeks but for me the triangle thing I
think depending on the concealer can be
extremely excessive I feel like it can
make me look I've got much concealer on
especially I use much powder under the
eye as well
I'll start trouble with creasing here if
I use too much concealer so what i'd
personally do is i put just a little bit
of concealer right here because you see
I don't I'm not wearing a makeup I don't
have dark circles today I got I got a
decent amount of sleep last night
surprised no no I didn't I don't know
why I don't have I guess it's all cease
lights are super bright which helps but
when I but I what I do is I'll put a
little bit right here and then I'll
blend it in a triangle form so that it's
not so much that's what I personally
choose to do I think you have to figure
out what works for you
I think the triangle shape can be very
good you just have to be careful not to
overdo it you know Michelle and I think
when Goss made a valid point about
concealer and doing triangle is how much
highlighter under the eye two people
actually need exactly and that's why
I've started doing I used to do the full
on triangle but I've started doing just
a little bit and then blending it into a
triangle shape instead which I really
really like Sara says no under-eye
triangles here too many fine lines from
smiling nice oh yeah ZYX thorne is Wayne
Goss said not to but he was in favor of
something similar a couple of years ago
I think it's just out of style now yeah
I mean I think that people are always
learning and expanding and trying new
things and it definitely was a couple of
years ago that was the thing to do but I
think it's kind of it doesn't work for
everybody you know you have to figure
out what works for you and your own
personal face and I think that's
something that gets lost with us in
YouTube beauty is you know we watch
people and watch these tutorials we look
at these beautiful beautiful men and
women and we see them applying this
makeup and see how gorgeous they look
and then we go and try the same thing
it doesn't do the same thing on us
because our cos are different our faces
don't look like theirs so what works for
some of the people who are watching may
not work for us and we have to tweak
things you know
Alexandra says I'm a weirdo who doesn't
wear concealer that's not weird that's
not weird at all
not everybody needs to wear concealer or
should wear concealer you should wear
what makes you comfortable what makes
you happy
Sydney I have really deep sunken under
eyes for triangle concealer doesn't work
for me
I use color correcting because my dark
circles are intense there you go exactly
that's exactly what I'm saying is you
have to figure out what works for you
absolutely
Ariel's has something very similar a
very dark purple under eyes I never do
the triangle I use a peach corrector and
then a creamy concealer works so much
better than a lighter color concealer
and wrinkle method - cake yes exactly
exactly you know and I also think you
know that that some of the people some
people and I'm not knocking this this is
not a bad thing it's a choice that some
people make that I am 100% okay with you
do what you want with your body but some
people get under-eye fillers and that
will you know naturally raise that part
of the eye so if you don't have
under-eye fillers
you know then then what works for that
person is going to be different then
what works for for you so CELTA yeah
exactly camera makeup is a whole new
face on top of your face yes and it does
look very different on camera than it
does in person like when I go to beauty
events and things and I see the people
of it I've seen on camera and they look
gorgeous on camera and then I see them
in person that's like whoa like it's a
it is kind of like a mask almost some of
them even though it's beautiful on
camera so I mean you got to take those
kinds of things into consideration and
and take all of the YouTube tutorials
every YouTube tutorial you watch with a
grain of salt and figure out what works
best for you alright we're almost sum of
this article I was going to go onto
another article but this one's been very
interesting number 15 make contouring
look more natural by using a pen or
pencil or makeup brush handle as your
guide to finding exactly where your
cheekbone is so around this random brush
that's just randomly sitting on my floor
so what they're saying is and this I
feel like does work so when you do your
contour you want it to line up with the
top of your ear
and the corner of your mouth so right
here is my contour line which when I
first started contouring I just like
this and I would contour here but what
that looks like is beard face it makes
me look like I've got a five o'clock
shadow which is not the look that I'm
personally going for so what we want is
the line up here so it's the difference
between here for me and here because we
want the cheeks to be lifted we don't
want to drag it down and then always
blend upward so putting that line there
I think can really help because again
everybody's face shape is different to
figure out where your contour line is so
I think that one is a really good tip I
like that one
Ashley I have enough of a slight indent
so I don't really need to do this there
you go nice yeah and not everybody needs
a contour not have to do everything that
everybody does you know Susan five
o'clock shade yeah exactly
exactly as me I think YouTube tutorials
can be kind of misleading it's lovely on
camera but some people like me guilty
can follow these tutorials too closely
and be confused as to how it looks so
about me yeah exactly and then we take
it personally like I used to do this all
the time I would follow a YouTube you
toriel and I would look at my face
afterward and be like oh my gosh I look
horrible like why did why did what did I
do wrong you know that was always a
thing what did I do wrong
why does this person look so much better
than I do and what it came down she was
because I don't look like them because
my face shape is different it wasn't
necessarily my skills which it probably
was partially my skills and it's done
Barbie for Julie egg but um you know I
mean I feel like we need to give
ourselves a break when it comes to
holding ourselves to the standards of
some of these YouTube tutorials
you know Shauna says I have high
cheekbones being a Native American but I
want my face to look slimmer contour
would look crazy on me yeah you have to
choose what works for you off topic
Steph says what was it like to meet
Emily Emily Noelle 83 she is amazing I
have I have no words she I don't think
she realizes how amazing she is I
honestly don't look I don't think she
realizes
how he is because I don't think she's
ever been to like a makeup event where
people would come up and like talk to
her like if she walked into to like Jen
Beauty or like beautycon or something
like that she would be mobbed I don't
think she realizes that and it's such a
beautiful thing you know she was so
thankful that I went to go visit her
like like dude dude deep this this is
opposite so that you're allowing me to
come and be in your presence I felt
because she's you know she's my item not
too many people have fangirl over but
Emily is one of those people so I mean
she is an incredible incredible person
and I'm really looking forward to you
know seeing opportunities come her way
and for her to do amazing things she's
she's an amazing person that was off
topic
she is very short Emily's very short
she's very little she is tiny and she's
she's wonderful I mean just amazing
yeah Sara says people who don't know how
amazing they are makes them more amazing
absolutely totally agree yeah I mean she
she really has no idea I only so once
her babies get bigger I hope she ends up
going to some events though so people
can meet her and she can meet people and
stuff but her babies you're too little
right now I wouldn't even able to do
what my babies for that little either
alright we're almost done with this
Oracle we got two left Matt the contours
of your face with a gel eyebrow pencil
since it's easier to apply pro precisely
and blend what so use a gel eyebrow
pencil to map out where to contour I
don't I don't know about that
I feel like instead maybe using the cut
instead of a gel eyebrow pencil it's a
cotton to like map out your contour I
would imagine that would be very
difficult to blend I don't know what I
would probably do if I was going to map
out a contour would be to take like an
eye like a fluffy eyeshadow brush like a
blending brush that would just apply a
tiny bit of product and then use that to
map out where to contour I think that's
a really weird choice I mean
I would imagine that will be difficult I
don't know what do you think yeah Rosie
says why not just use a cream contour
yeah I hear you AJ says sounds like an
extra step waste of eyebrow product yeah
I agree
tessarin says nope no way
I suck at contouring blending that will
be hard I'm with you now says harder to
blend in just contour yeah I know
that's isn't that makes no sense to me I
don't get that at all
Bree oh so I've hooded eyes how should I
do my eyeliner I would say watch someone
that did a tutorial for her I would say
don't ask me I would say starting off
small I think is very very important
my says do the opposite that I agree
Southie said is Emily still a news
anchor no she stopped doing that a few
years ago as may sounds like a heck of
an Instagram clickbait hack I know right
yeah no no no no no no Oh Jenna said
something I missed it sorry Jenna
it's skipped down Heather says Sydney
it's in was probably just trying to come
up with another tip for the article and
that sounded like it could be a good one
off the top of her head or something
yeah I agree I feel like that one
probably wasn't um wasn't actually
tested that's not that's not a good one
I I don't think that's a good idea
alright number 17 blot your face in a
