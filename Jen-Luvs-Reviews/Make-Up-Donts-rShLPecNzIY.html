where you get to see me
super super pale this is a tag video and
I was tagged by sassy soap box Beauty
who I absolutely adore and if you have
not seen her videos she is fabulous this
tag video is all about makeup don'ts and
the makeup don'ts that I chose are
don'ts that I've actually done before
for the most part I don't I I'm not even
sure I think there might be one of these
don'ts that I haven't actually done so
if you've done these things don't worry
I have done them too I have learned my
lesson especially after watching so many
videos on YouTube and realizing that
that was not the way to put on makeup
this video was started by Mel mphs and
somebody else that I forgot but I happen
to love Melissa who does amazing videos
so yeah you can check out her videos too
first makeup don't that I'm going to say
is don't apply your foundation too thick
and I actually did this for Halloween I
just thought in this Revlon Colorstay
and this is what I did is I poured a
bunch on my hand like this and then I
took my brush and I just started
slapping it on my face and it came off
so cakey and awful look at this ya don't
need this this looks terrible don't do
that here look I got more I'm gonna put
more on because you know I want full
coverage so we're gonna just kick that
baby on can you believe I actually went
out of the house something like this
yeah this was pretty much what it looked
like and it wasn't it was Halloween but
it wasn't meant to look like this this
looks awful the next makeup don't is
don't forget to apply your powder yeah
I'm gonna say I don't need powder I'm
not gonna set my foundation I'm just
gonna look super shiny and I'm gonna let
it go with that now put your blush just
right in the circle in your cheeks
because that's where it really matters
right there make sure you look nice and
we right this is actually a real big pet
peeve of mine that I see people
all the time and it's people that don't
blend their eyeshadow put it right on
there there we go okay I'm gonna put
that on okay put that in my crease there
we go I'm gonna just pack that color on
and my crease there we go okay
the other thing you want to make sure
that you do is you want to make sure
your eyeshadow carries down under here
because that looks really nice I love
that I'm not gonna blend that at all
because I like my nice bright colors I
I'm so tempted to use it to blend this
out I've got can't even stand it this is
what a lot of people do they go like
this and they apply it above your
lashline and then let's wing that baby
out Boop
let's wing it way up high there we go
and we're gonna wing it all the way up
okay now let's do the same thing really
far away from the lash line you know
because then you can really see it
really far away and wing it way up there
okay beautiful the next thing is you
know mascara you could just go crazy
with your mascara and we're not gonna be
careful all we're just gonna glop it on
there look Oh a mist that's okay we'll
just leave it there it's all good here
we go let's get some more on this side
look see I got some of my lower lash
line but don't you worry about that oh I
miss again oh it's fine just leave it on
there it just adds extra flavor let's
make sure we get those lower lashes
there we go don't worry about if you get
it under your eyes no big deal you know
what we want our lower line to match the
top so we're gonna take that gray and
we're gonna put it on our lower lash
line just to make sure we really made
our point
here we go there we go hey what do you
think of that okay let's make sure we
really get that on there so everybody
can really see how beautiful we can make
our lot our lower lash line see oh we
got to do lips lips Oh lips are
essential with this bright eye we always
want to do a
right lip this Revlon lip butter in red
velvet and you know I always wanted my
lips to be bigger always want to be
bigger so let's really get them out
there okay there's my natural lip line
okay and let's make it even bigger there
we go
really get that on there I'll get down
below don't forget down below
really make it big okay what do you
think do I look fabulous or what
awesome I've got my shiny face my bright
eye my bright cheeks my bright lips I
just look amazing don't I I'm so glad my
kids room but I would scare them to
death my 1 year old whip just been
crying because you like it really gloss
that baby up there we go make it nice
and shiny just to make this extra bold
let's add some glitter really bode
craziness let's put the glitter all over
all over our lids and just look gorgeous
and you know what while we're at it
let's add some glitter for a highlight
on our cheeks because you know we always
want to highlight so we'll just
highlight with some eyeliner glitter you
know we're multi-purpose here let's
contour this baby up and see if we can
really get a nice sharp contour you know
what and I want to look like I've got a
chance I'm gonna put some of my nose it
really look like I got a tan well I
better put some on the forehead make
sure I really look like I've been in the
Sun that looks great so here are the key
points don't overdo your foundation
always wear your pressed powder don't
wear a bright eye with a bright lip
don't put your eyeliner above your lash
line make sure you always blend your eye
shadow never put this much bronzer on it
looks insane make sure always careful
with your mascara so it doesn't go crazy
like this ah mad love and I will see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
