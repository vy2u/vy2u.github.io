you want to be a part of it and then we
can converse about the details about
that alright so on to this review oh
sorry my hair is flat because of the hat
so excuse the hair this is these four
favorites in the glow blush bronzer and
lou manizer sampler i'm going to tell
you about all the stuff in here let's go
ahead and start with blushes the first
flush I want to talk about is the tart
blush and tart tart is known for their
blushes this is the sample size this is
a full-size the net grams on a full size
is 5.6 and the next size on the sample
is 3.4 this is in the color splendor and
it does have a little bit of a sparkle
to it so if you're not a fan of sparkle
blushes this will not be for you I do
recommend that you use a very dense
brush when you put this one on show that
you can really get some good color it is
buildable but it's hard with a very
fluffy brush to even get it to go on
your skin but overall really like this
it is a nice color for my complexion
next up I want to talk about this Stila
convertible color and peony and this one
will definitely get lost on anything
other than lighter skin it is a cream
blush and I'm a huge fan of cream blush
it looks gorgeous on my light skin you
can also use this as a lip color but it
is very very pale it but on light skin
it is
full and I am in love with us for that
finally the last blush is the tart flush
and this is a cheek stain and it is
similar to a cream blush inconsistency
this one does have a little bit of a
darker color so if you're medium skin
you might be able to get away with this
one no dark skin you're not gonna be
able to see this it's just not pigmented
enough but it does have a really nice
staying power on this blush I was
surprised I really really like it a lot
and am going to look into getting
full-size versions of other colors of
this because I am enjoying this quite a
bit on to highlighters all right Heidi I
feel like everybody should have a high
beam I don't know I'm just in love with
this stuff it does have I'm not going to
open this one but because I already have
a full-size open but it's like a nail
polish brush then she using you just
kind of dawn it on and gently smooth
either with your finger with a brush and
it a gorgeous highlight and it stays on
this has really nice lasting power
definitely a good one for a highlighter
this is a perfectly lit oil-free
luminizing powder by little rock this is
not my favorite for a highlighter for
the cheek I don't feel like you can
really see it on the cheek I've been
using this as a highlighter for the brow
bone and um as I can inner corner
eyeshadow and this is gorgeous for that
but I could not see it on my cheek maybe
if you're even more fair skin than me
then maybe it'll work for you but more
of a brow bone highlighter for me in
this lorac won the final one is my
favorite and it is by bare minerals and
it is in pure radiance and you can see
that this I don't know what the size is
of their highlighters but this is a
full-size eye shadow from bare minerals
and that's the exact same size as the
sample size of the highlighter and this
is absolutely gorgeous and I actually
even like this better than the benefit
hiding which I was shocked because I
love my benefit high beams it's got a
really nice shine to it without being
overpowering and it's blendable which is
really nice you don't really get that
with the other highlighters that it just
really blends nicely the benefit you
stick it on and it's stuck there the
lorac to light doesn't really stay on at
all the bare minerals minerals one if
you put it here
blends nicely into your blushes it's
very flawless love it finally on to the
bronzers we have Laura Mercier's golden
mosaic this is a full-size illuminator
the full-size illuminator is six grams
and the sample size bronzer is four
grams I do like this you know why I like
this this is really nice for a winter
time on your cheekbone not looking like
you're dead because the sun is not out
and is not making you look as glowy as
you do in the summer this is your really
nice winter bronzer for on your
cheekbones I did not have good luck
contouring with this I didn't feel like
it was pigments and enough for that but
I really liked it all my cheekbones very
beautiful for that it does have a little
bit of a shimmer and that's another
reason why i don't really like it as a
contour I don't like my majel's to
shimmer I just think it looks weird okay
the next one is by to face and this is
their chocolate soleil bronzer this is
the Sun bunny bronzer i have the same
problem with the chocolate soleil which
smells amazing it smells like chocolate
as i do with the Sun bunny I use this a
lot in the summer time for on my cheeks
to make it look more like I've been out
in the Sun but I cannot use this for
contouring it is a little too pigmented
and not as plentiful as I would like for
contouring but this may work better on
someone with a medium skin tone then it
does on me so if you're medium skin this
may be the bronzer for you finally big
shocker my favorite bronzer of the bunch
was the NARS Laguna bronzer if you watch
videos on YouTube you know NARS Laguna
is like the holy grail bronzer and I was
so anxious to try it I was a little
worried because it is so teeny tiny that
I wouldn't be able to really get my
brush in there to do what I needed to do
but it was fine it really was and this
is a fantastic contouring bronzer I am
this is by far the best contouring
browser i have ever tried it works or
just on my skin I've heard it works very
well on other skin tones this is amazing
in summary favorites of this kit I
honestly liked all three blushes equal
for my skin tone for the highlighter my
favorite was the bare minerals in pure
radiance and for the bronzer the NARS
Laguna was my favorite overall would
recommend this for light skin tones it's
a hit or a miss for a medium skin tone
you're gonna like probably most of it
darker skin tone I would pass on this
