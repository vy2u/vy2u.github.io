minute from what's up and makeup for
december 12 2016 let's start your Monday
with a story once upon a time there were
three sisters who started storybook
cosmetics with brushes and dreams that
were not sponsored by endorsed by or
associated in any way with the owners or
creators of any other pre-existing
literary or artistic work one day they
dreamed a wizardry and witchcraft pellet
which is coming very soon they even
dreamed swatches next they dreamed of a
quill and ink liner duo to go with it
which is coming in 2017 and then they
said we need liquid lipsticks too and
they'll be in this very pretty packaging
but it all started with the brushes so
how could they possibly top that with a
whole new set of brushes set to debut in
2017 and there was joy and dancing
throughout the land and everyone had
sweet dreams of being magically gorgeous
the end that's it for now let's see you
same time tomorrow don't forget what's
at the makeup every Sunday morning 9:30
