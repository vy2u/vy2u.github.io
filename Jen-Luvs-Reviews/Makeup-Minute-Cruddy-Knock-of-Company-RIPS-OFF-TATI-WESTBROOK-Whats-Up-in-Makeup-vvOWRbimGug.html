minute from what's up and makeup for
January 9th 2017 and today we tell a
tale of brand versus youtuber our tail
stars everyone's favorite tatsi
Westbrook during her worst makeup of
2016 video Todd he explained that she
did not like the new silicone sponges
that are on the market namely the
original from Molly cosmetics she then
claimed that a knockoff company stole
that video with the bad review remixed
it to become a positive review and
posted on their Facebook page where they
refused to take it down but the plot
thickens
many of Tottie's fans found the video on
CeeLo beauty's Facebook page and took to
their social media to complain and got
up shall we say less than professional
response from customer service as of the
time we filmed this minute CeeLo
beauty's Facebook page has been taken
down their website is still up however
and we were surprised to find versions
of other popular makeup sponges they're
what keep you posted as the story
develops that's it for now we'll see you
