a minute ago I'm at a rest stop in New
Jersey I know right take two and the
Wi-Fi here is not fantastic not one not
Wi-Fi I'm using for GE like data to do
this so I just wanted to clarify and let
me let me get out of the Sun here yeah
so I'm driving to generation Beauty in
New Jersey in New York and found out
that the information in the make up
minute was inaccurate we talked about a
collaboration with desi Perkins and make
up forevers that is not true desi was
just watching their new shades so thank
you so much to community member Rachel
for pointing that out the last thing we
want to do is put something out there
that is not true
and it was not accurate it was just a
miscommunication we just you know we got
it wrong and I do apologize for its
getting out any rumors in there we have
no evidence at this point it was just a
you know it was just it just got
interpreted wrong and it got passed on
to me and it was just interpreted wrong
and now we know that it wasn't it's
correct so I just wanted to let you guys
know that's why there's no makeup minute
today I took the video down because I
don't want the last the last thing I
want is to put out information that's
wrong so I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna
get another cup of coffee
real quick and I am going to get back on
the road but I did want to let you know
to make sure that no rumors start with
things that aren't true this is the
first time we've ever done a retraction
in the what three years of doing the
show so yeah and I could I would fix it
right now but I'm not home I'm on the
road and I have no way to fix it right
now or else I would I would reapplied it
with new information but it's just the
worst possible to have it happen but
that's okay that's alright we're gonna
roll with it
and on Monday there's going to be makeup
minute is gonna be back I am going to
generation Beauty so no makeup minute
tomorrow know what's up and make up this
weekend and no chat this weekend but
