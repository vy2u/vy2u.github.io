for you that I found on Sephora and Ulta
websites that are rated really high and
I feel like they are rated really high
for a really good reason so I want to
share those reasons with you so you can
decide whether these products are right
for you or not and we're gonna go ahead
and start with that right now just as a
side note on my lips today I have the
OCC lip tar in artifact and then on my
eyes today I have the Anasazi about Lee
Hills prism palette review for this is
coming soon I was gonna try to review it
today but I don't think I've tested it
enough so this will be coming soon my
criteria for this is I really tried to
get the products to be over a 4.8 rating
on Ulta and Sephora and I also wanted to
make sure that enough people had rated
it for it to be fair so if it only had
one or two or ten or fifteen ratings I
automatically threw it out if you've
been around my channel for a while some
of these products are not going to be a
surprise to you but there are definitely
some things in here that I've never
showed on a channel so I'm really
excited to show them to you so let's
start with the first one and the first
one was my number one product in a
favorites and fails countdown one month
I think it might have been August and
it's the Tarte clay play palette
recently this has been on sale at
Sephora I believe for half off so
definitely keep your eye out for this
for sales and deals along with it being
an eyeshadow palette you also have three
different contour shades and they give
you a really nice deep one for people of
deeper skin tones of course this
probably won't be a contour for every
deep skintone but I really do like that
they at least tried to give a range of
light medium and deep they also kind of
did that with the shades in here as well
so you've kind of got a lighter look
here a medium look here and a deep look
here but really people if any skin tone
can use any of these shades you just
have to kind of find out what works for
you by mixing them together now I'm not
typically the biggest fan of Tarte
eyeshadows but I really feel like they
are trying really hard to improve their
formula and I feel like lately I've had
more hits with Tarte then misses one
thing to keep in mind with this is it
does have that vanilla scent so if you
don't like the vanilla scented makeup
product you are not going to like this
because I can smell it right now with
the palette open but if you think that
sounds nice I personally really like the
scent it smells very good to me I like
smelling a nice sweet scent when I open
my makeup but that's just me the big
thing I love about this is the lasting
power and the blend ability of the
shadows I find this to be a very easy
palette to work with and that's one of
the big reasons why I feel like it is a
super super super win next up are the
essence satin touch touch blushes if I
can even say it these are really nice
blushes the big want-want with these
which is the same thing with a lot of
essence products is the shade range is
really bad
I think there's only two shades of this
available it's a nice soft buildable
blush lasting power is very very good
they're very inexpensive which is
fabulous so if this looks like a shade
that you think you would enjoy I
definitely recommend these they're
really really nice
along with these you might want to check
out I think they do have a better range
for these these are the essence mosaic
blushes these are really nice too so if
this shade range looks good to you I
would definitely recommend these as well
kind of give you a little bit more
options these are hidden gems
I have never I don't think on any
channel ever seen anybody talk about
these they are the jcat Beauty triple
crown baked eyeshadows you can only get
these online but these are fabulous let
me swatch these for you
you get three shades in each one the
only one I don't recommend is the blue
one that one was super powdery I
actually be cluttered that one but these
are stinking amazing oh I dipped into
the peach a little bit there but oh my
gosh just really really really gorgeous
really pretty let's watch another one
that one was called cherry fudge sundae
let's swatch this one this one is called
grilled mango this one's a great one if
you like those warm tones feel like this
won't be really beautiful on a deeper
skin tone there's that and then boil
these were sent to me by Jake at beauty
years ago I have kept them because I
love them they are very old in my
collection yet they are still very
creamy and they're wonderful they
perform great of course they're gonna be
supplemental shadows and that you know
you're not going to be able to get like
a look with a transition and a brow bone
highlight and all of that with these
trios
but they are very good quality so if you
find any
the colors call out to you I would
definitely recommend them I believe they
come in twelve different shades this is
the other one that I can vouch for this
one is called Baked Alaska this one's a
really nice cool toned brownish kind of
look it's very very nice so if you lay
down let's say you put down a you know a
base of like a tart clay play and then
you use these as like accent colors
seriously seriously awesome and these I
believe these are only six bucks a piece
I think they're totally worth it
next up I don't technically have this
but I have parts of it it's this Stila
written in the stars glitter and glow
liquid eye shadow set I have two of them
in full size and I'm kind of kicking
myself because I wish I bought the
smaller sized set with the third one
with the red one in it instead of having
two of these because these are $24 a
piece I love these things I've talked
about these in the channel multiple
times the glitter on these is ridiculous
this is for like New Year's Eve glitter
eyes like that kind of look I mean
really really beautiful I have the
shades kitten Karma and diamond dust I
also have ballet baby and I'm really
thinking about getting the new
iridescent ones they do have them at
least last time I checked in stock at
Ulta I think only one was left at
Sephora but anyway online but these are
amazing my only critique of these is
that if you have hooded lids or if
you're you notice that you get transfer
from your lid to like the top part of
your eye you want to stay away from
these because they do transfer
throughout the day unless it you know
you don't mind that personally I don't
really like the way that looks and I do
get a little bit of transfer into my
crease which I don't enjoy but if you
can deal with that if you're okay with
that then you'll be fine
remember you can also use these as
eyeliner with an eyeliner brush if you
wanted to just do a little bit of
glitter on your upper lash line just
absolutely gorgeous highly recommend
these they're beautiful if you can get
it in that gift set for less expensive
that is a huge win next is an oldie but
a goodie
this is the galaxy chic baked eyeshadow
palette by BH Cosmetics is this as good
as my high-end eyeshadow palettes no but
it is really really really really good
and I have been enjoying this from
years I definitely got this when I was
at my old house cuz I remember the
review on this I will link it down below
it's very very old I'm just warning you
ahead of time the quality on that video
is not what you're seeing here but the
content is very good I really love this
because you really have every color you
could possibly want I mean red orange
yellow green oh no not really any strong
I'm you got some tea lush greens here
blue purple then you've got some Browns
here you've got some dark purple some
light purple I mean it's really really a
beautiful palette and the pigmentation
is fabulous lasting power is also really
good but I definitely recommend using a
primer there are no big chunks of
glitter in here so you don't have to
worry about a ton of fallout when you're
using them and it's just a really fun
palette to play with I have to admit I
don't dip into it super often because I
honestly forget about it but that is not
because of the quality of it the quality
is really good and especially if you're
on a budget then I and you want some
colors I would recommend this but but I
feel like I've seen this for like even
ten dollars at the BH Cosmetics website
just kind of keep your eye out for it
also it goes on HauteLook every once in
a while again definitely not the same
quality as my high-end eyeshadows but at
the same time it is a great way to add
color to your lids at a less expensive
price alright I have to because you know
I'm honest I have to its the Jacqueline
Hill morphe palette this is a phenomenal
palette you just can't get around it
okay I am not affiliated with morphe I
am not affiliated with Jaclyn hill I
think if you watch my channel for a
while you know that this packaging is
disgusting it has gotten so incredibly
filthy I have tried to clean it and it
has gotten a little bit better it did
stain a bit but now it's dirty again so
I do need to clean it again it can get
cleaner than what it is now if I really
work at it but it definitely is stained
they are coming out with a new packaging
at Ulta I'm not sure if you order it
right now whether you'll get the new
packaging or not but it is one that you
can just wipe off super easily with the
dirt so I would definitely recommend
ordering it from Ulta rather than from
morphe right now just because I feel
like you're probably more likely to get
that new packaging I haven't seen
anybody actually physically get the new
packaging yet though so
tossing my fingers that you can I have
no ends at ulta so I don't know 100% but
anyway the quality these shadows is
fantastic I'm not even kidding like I I
don't I can't say anything but positive
things about overall the quality of
these shadows this is not the same
formula as the traditional morphe
palette the 35 oh the 35 s the 35 mm the
five to zero six nine I don't know
whatever they're naming them it's a
totally different formula the the
formula that this matches is their 25
pan palette so if you've ever tried the
morphe 25 pan palettes that's the same
formula is this the other ones are very
different I don't know if this is the
same formula as the new 3502 I think is
what it's called but if I figure that
out I will put that in the description
box below I would not recommend honestly
the other morphe palettes I don't enjoy
those at all but this one this one is
really really it's legit good it's good
it is it's great it's a fantastic
palette my only critique about the shade
range here is I wish there was a little
bit more cool especially a cool
transition color I think that would have
been really nice I feel like you've got
some deeper cools in here but like a
transition color for me for medium skin
tones somewhere up in here I feel like
there's too much warm transition if they
just if she just thrown in one cool
transition that would have made me super
happy oh and then a matte brow bone
shade I wish there was one of those in
here but other than that it's fantastic
I do have full reviews of this I have
dupe videos I have all kinds of stuff I
will link those down below as well now
I'm going to show you some products that
are both highly rated both at Sephora
and at Ulta and this is the modern
renaissance palette by Anastasia Beverly
Hills you have probably seen this before
I love this palette I find it very very
easy to use I don't find it as easy to
use as the Jaclyn hill palette to be
completely honest because I feel like
the pigmentation here is much more
intense so these are more likely to go
on super strong and be a little harder
to blend out but overall I really love
this I don't have a problem working with
it but I can see if you're not careful
with how much you dip your brush into it
then it may be a little more difficult
to work with but overall I mean I love
it it's it you can get all kinds of
looks out of it you can get lighter
looks deeper look smokier looks daytime
looks whatever you want as long as you
like
warm colors
if you want a cool look bad ain't
happenin but if you if this state
selection calls to you and for some
reason you don't own this I would
recommend it to you I really enjoy it I
know not everybody loves this palette
but I personally do got a lot of shadow
in here but that was what was highly
rated so this is something that's a
little different and it is the Shiseido
facial cut ins this is rated at a 4.9 on
Ulta and a 4.9 at Sephora these are
amazing I use these with my toner so
what I do is I put my toner on and then
I wipe it all over my face these things
are really really thick and they're very
very soft and that's what makes them
better than the cheaper ones I think
these are $10 a container I used to be
nine and I think they raised it a little
bit which is kind of a bummer
I always get these at the Sephora sale
the 20% off sale or 15% off whatever you
get I always get it at that sale every
year I get a couple of packs of them
they last me through the year these
things are amazing for a removing makeup
you makeup remover on here my solar
water or whatever anything you're using
to kind of go all over your face that's
like a liquidy kind of consistency
that's what these are for oh my gosh
they're amazing
they're absolute amazing I love them I
think they're totally worth the few
extra dollar investment over cheap ones
now moving into the Sephora exclusives
this is a new one this is the Kat Von D
synced &amp;amp; Center palette this I just did
a full review on this one
I'll give you kind of a summary I don't
recommend this for beginners I find it
very difficult to figure out which
shades go together in order to make a
look in that video I'll show you some
photos that I got off of Reddit of this
reorganized that helped me to kind of
make color combinations with it kind of
figure out what I want to do with it but
overall I mean the quality of the
shadows the way they blend together the
amount of looks you can create with this
is infinite it's absolutely infinite
it's really really fun to work with
again pigmentation is amazing this is
going to be for your creative makeup
lovers out there people that want to do
something new and different and unique
and think outside the box that's who
this is for I mean it's just it's a
wonderful quality palette it lives up to
Kat Von D standards and speaking of Kat
Von D standards we're gonna move on to
the Kat Von D shade + light eye contour
palette and
why there's so much eyes in here it's
just that's that's what I owned I saw so
this is the eye contour palette I've
heard some people that don't enjoy this
this is relatively new to my collection
even though it's been out for a while
but I really have been enjoying it and
one thing that I like about this that I
feel like that the clay play doesn't
have is I feel like this has a lot more
cool in it so for if you enjoy a lot of
cool tones you've got a lot of cool
going on here well really it's supposed
to be neutral cool and warm toned where
this one is warm tone but I feel like
the cool lovers are gonna be able to
really live in this section over here
it's just a great way to lay down the
base of an eyeshadow look and then use
something like the J cat Beauty
eyeshadows I mean it's just it's a
wonderful eyeshadow palette I feel like
that I like the lasting power of the
Tarte one better but I like the shade
selection of this one just a little bit
better I really honestly don't think you
need both of these so really it's gonna
be about whether you really want to use
these contour shades or not and then the
lasting power is a little better on this
Fiat you if you mean more cool than this
one's gonna be better but both of them
honestly are very very good palettes and
it really is whatever whatever you like
they're both really really good well and
this one doesn't smell like vanilla so
if the vanilla you don't like you're
gonna want this one but they're both
really really good this is the contour
book vol 2 art of sculpting and defining
by Kevin a Kwan Kevin a Kwan is a luxury
makeup brand so the price points are a
bit higher but this is a really
wonderful travel palette like if let's
say you you're a business person and you
are flying all the time or you're
traveling all the time of you just need
basic looks like you're not trying to do
anything fancy you just want something
basic that you can wear every single day
this is perfect the quality of these
eyeshadows in here are phenomenal
we are looking at more neutral to cool
toned products in here as far as the
contour shades the highlight shades I'm
not a big fan of the cream a highlight
shade the highlighter in here is very
very subtle so again very work business
office kind of appropriate a highlight
there because it's not going to give you
that from space Jacqueline Hill kind of
glow it's gonna give you something a lot
more subtle similar to the hourglass
this is a very I would say a more mature
palette in that this
something that is very professional so
if you're looking for something like
that I would definitely recommend this
it does come with the mirror and then
here on the inside it gives you some
ideas of how you can use the shadows and
I've been using this for a very long
time you see there's a giant scratch
over it because this thing's been
through a lot it's been through a lot
and it's a wonderful wonderful palette I
definitely recommend it and then finally
I had to add this one because I feel
like the reason why I've kind of been
like well it's so ordinary is because I
am NOT a connoisseur and what I'm
realizing is that mostly from reading
comments is that this is actually a
really really good gloss this is the
Fenty beauty gloss balm and this is kind
of what I equated to is if I went out
and bought a two hundred dollar bottle
of wine and I bought a $20 bottle of
wine or even a $2.00 box of wine
whatever I don't think they sell for two
dollars but anyway you get my point I
probably wouldn't be able to tell you
why one was more was more expensive than
the other because I'm not a wine
connoisseur I don't drink wine all the
time I can drink wine out of the box and
be perfectly happy I could drink a two
hundred dollar bottle of wine and be
perfectly happy I'm not picky like that
and that's the way I am with my glosses
well that's not quite true there are
things I like and don't like about
glosses I don't like them be sticky I
don't like them to be too heavy I like
it when making a layer over top of
another lip product and look really
really pretty this can do all of those
things the other thing about this that's
really good is that it's got a very very
soft applicator it just feels very
comfortable it smells really good to me
it smells like cherries I've heard other
people tell me that it smells like other
things but to me it smells like like
cherry candy and it smells amazing but
in the end for me it's just the gloss
it's just a gloss it's it's I don't need
a fancy schmancy galls in the end but am
I very thankful to have this yes
absolutely
is it a standout amazing everyone must
go buy a product no but if you are a
gloss person and you are a gloss
connoisseur then this might be something
you want to look into I can't think of
anything that it's missing you know what
I mean unless you don't like cents
that's the only thing that I think with
Freud this thing out there but I mean it
is beautiful I really like it
but you know I think he'd get what I'm
trying to say my hair keeps like poofing
out everywhere like it's like I turn
around and like the next thing I know
like my hair is it going for but anyway
I would love to know what your thoughts
thoughts are on these products do you
think that'd be high rating on Sephora
and Ulta are justified for these
products are these things that you own
are these things that you want to own
are these things you've heard good
things about bad things about what are
your thoughts on these products that
I've mentioned this video let's talk
about it in the comments down below we

awesomeness we work together to save
money on things that we don't need to be
buying and to buy things that are
stinking amazing so let's all have a
