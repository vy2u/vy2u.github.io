when I wear this on a date night hack
know what I wear this to a concert oh
yeah
hello my friends welcome to my very
first and maybe only for looks one
palette this is it a collaboration with
my good friend Kristen over at Kristin
game this is her baby and we are
celebrating together her 40th four looks
one palette video she does these all the
time she's done with so many different
palettes with the Too Faced chocolate
bonbons palette with the revealed
palettes with the Gwen Stefani palette I
mean so many pounds 40 palettes she's
done this this width and she's so good
at it she's so amazing him she's
perfected this so I'm hoping I can do
her format justice we had an opportunity
to meet at IMATS this past year and I'm
telling you like it was it was magical
when I met Kristen it was like we'd
known each other for years this is the
girls on film palette by makeup
revolution you can buy Ulta online or in
the stores I don't think there's any
other retails retailers in the United
States that sell makeup revolution this
is not a new palette but it is new to
being relatively new to the United
States within the past six months or so
all of these circular ones here are all
matte this one's kind of a satiny matte
it's very close to a met the rests are
all like shimmers and satiny kinds of
shades there's no glitter shades in here
now for this look today I had some
trouble finding a crease color that I
liked in here because I like one that's
kind of in between these two shades here
so what I did was I mix these two
together to get my crease shape for my
center of my lid I used this shade here
and then for the inner and outer corners
I use this olivey brownish kind of shade
here and then for my lower lash line I
use this kind of burgundy shade and then
I used that from the outer corner into
the inner corner and then from the like
maybe 2/3 of the way here kind of a
little bit over to a little past the
middle I use this one I know that sounds
complex but really just
from here to here and then light
overlapping a little bit over to here
hopefully that makes sense just to kind
of give it a little bit more dimension
on my lower lashline and that's all I
use oh and then I use this shade on my
brow bone and it was a pretty it's a
pretty basic simple look I mean just a
pat here with the gold with a BIST Goldy
kind of color Pat here here and here
mixing these two up in the crease and
then this for brow bone I mean it really
wasn't that complex of a look so I'm
gonna go ahead and zoom you in so you
can see the look up close for the rest
of what I paired with this I use the
Tarte so fine liquid liner this is my
new favorite for my eyeliner eyeshadow
primer I use the Urban Decay eyeshadow
primer potion and I plan on using this
for every single look for my blush and
lipstick today I'm actually wearing my
lipstick Queen blush in the frog print
shade and then the lipstick queen lip
gloss I have a review on these that I
just filmed right before I film this so
this is kind of you know I'm kind of
doing two videos in one kind of thing
trying to do this with that but I feel
like it paired really well with the eye
look so I'm pretty happy about that if
you want to see more about these Frog
Prince green products if I can or neroon
if you want to see more about these
green products I will link that video
down below for mascara I use the
Maybelline lash sensational and this is
what I will be using for all of the
looks oh speaking of that let's get into
the second law alright my friends this
is the second eye look with the girls on
film palette alright so I feel like I
got some explaining to do so this lip is
crazy I know it's crazy but I'm about to
tell them what's up in makeup and I've
been watching too many videos for the
NYX face awards and it's like you know
there's so much cool stuff you can do
with makeup and I feel like I get stuck
in the same rut of that neutral lip all
the time now what I wear this to work oh
heck no wonder where this on a date
night pack know what I wear this to a
concert oh yeah
it's fun and I'm just having a good time
so that's kind of where this is going it
started off with the eyeshadow palette
and then it all went goth from there do
you want to mention that all my lips
today I do have guests by color pop is
kind of where I started and then I all
read out in the middle with namaste
which is the Tarte lip paint and then I
put all over that unicorn tears by Tarte
and honestly I really liked the way it
came out I was on periscope getting
ready and about 80% of the people really
liked it about 20% were like no but I
decided to go with it anyway I went with
the 80% and I'm having fun with it and I
think that's what makeups all about
right even if it's not quite fitting
your personality it's still fun let me
go ahead and zoom you in a little bit on
the eyes and talk about what I used from
the girls on film right so on the eyes
today I am wearing false lashes first of
all they are the Ardell 120s and I love
them for the palette I decided to do
once again which has kind of been my
go-to with this palette mixing these two
in my for my crease for my transition
shade kind of those together then what I
did was I put this purple shade from the
outer outer corner to about two-thirds
of the way in then about from about half
to all the way in I use this shade right
here and that's kind of what's giving it
that silvery look I did use this gray on
the outer corner just to kind of swirl
it around I also use this shade here for
an inner corner highlight and also to
blend out my brow bone and that's really
all I used in this I lost let me go
ahead yeah really close so you can see
what the eye look looks like
and while we're up close let's just talk
about how I paired this I used for my
contour the Smashbox contour palette and
I just used this shade right here there
is a dupe palette for this the elf
contour palette are the exact same
shades but the lasting power is less
with the elf but if you want the same
look at the Smashbox without the price
definitely go for the elf instead of
this because it does essentially the
same thing application lines and then
this one scared me I just got this in my
boxycharm this is the makeup geek shade
and xoxo and when I put this on it went
straight to clown face totally freaked
me out
probably over blended it out like I
don't even know how much you can really
see it between the contour and the
highlight I mean the highlight is poppin
it's crazy this highlight but I think I
blended it a little too far out I'm
getting used to this new camera and the
new lighting that I have so it's it's
hard for me to judge what's gonna show
up on camera and what's not but I do
really really like this blush just be
careful with it as far as the
pigmentation it will go straight to
clown face if you're not that highlights
today the poppin craziness I have my
cheeks is Urban Decay's sin this is a
fantastic highlight reminds me a lot of
the balm was mary loumanizer and i
really really loved mary loumanizer and
so i'm probably gonna take this back to
the store because on me they look the
same i know and other people they look
different but on me they look the same
so i'm probably gonna end up taking sin
back but isn't that gorgeous oh my gosh
and if I didn't have Mary Lou I would
definitely love this one but it's too
it's too similar to similar lasting
power definitely fantastic it says it's
eight hours I would argue it's longer
than eight hours definitely so that's
what I have owned Russo a mouthful so
I'm gonna go ahead and film what's up
and makeup and I will see you in about
two seconds with the third look all
right ladies and gentlemen this is the
third look in my four looks one palette
with Kristin game and you already know
that because you've already seen two of
them this one's a little bit calmer I
wanted to do something that was a lot
more wearable especially since the last
one was really kind of insane so we did
something a little calmer today let's go
into the eyeshadows and which ones I use
out of the palette today so really I
wanted I wonder really focus on the
lightness of it with just kind of like
uh you know deepening
the outer corner just a little bit more
wearable so what I did is again I use
these two it up in my crease to give a
transition color that's what I've been
doing every time and I wanted to use
this one all over my lid this shade
right here I really like the shade a lot
that's all that shimmer you're seeing on
the lid okay then up on my brow bone I
use this one just to kind of give a
little more dimension to my brow bone a
bit and then this is the shade that I
use to deepen up the outer corner I just
kind of swirled it in the outer corner
and that's pretty much the entire look I
did use a little bit of this up on the
brow bone and you know I'm happy with
this look I think it came out great and
I'm gonna go ahead and zoom in and show
you the look up close and then I'll tell
you what else I used on my face today
and one thing I'm finding as I get older
I just cannot get that Instagram
sharpness of my eyeliner anymore I just
can't the eyeliner no matter what I use
seeps into my fine line so what I end up
doing is I use a brush like a flat
eyeliner brush or an eyeshadow brush and
kind of smudge it out a little bit but
still I still have trouble with it and
the only liners that I feel like don't
do that at all are the gel liners the
ones that you apply with the brush those
tend to not do it as much so like the
average everyday person looking at me
isn't going to notice but if I'm gonna
do close-ups for Instagram or close-ups
with you right now
you can see that it's not as crisp as
you may see in other videos and that's
just because my lids just aren't as taut
as they used to be I'll be 38 in a few
weeks so I mean that's just what happens
as we get older so you know I'm letting
it go I'm letting it go like Elsa I'm so
letting it go so for contour I use the
makeup revolution contour palette this
is a really nice contour palette I use
underneath my eyes I use this shake here
to brighten up my under eyes over top of
my concealer I'll talked about the
concealer in a minute as well in the
final look I've used that the same and
then this is the shade I used for
contouring so that's what we have here
and it's just a nice light contour
nothing crazy just you know enough for
like a wearable look for blush today I
used the NYX blush in Spanish rose this
is the baked blush it does have some
shimmer in it so I use that kind of as a
both a highlight and a blush lasting
power is pretty typical about six hours
on me not too bad it's surprisingly the
lasting power on this contour pump looks
really good actually lasting all day
which is really awesome for lips today I
use my colour-pop ultra matte in Bianca
and that is what's on my lips today I
don't know if it's gonna come out before
this video or after but I'm gonna do a
color pop new lip video just talking
that all of the pinky nudes and brownie
nudes that I have from colour-pop kind
of comparing different shades so you can
decide which nude lipsticks you might
want from colour-pop so this is gonna be
included in that video I'm gonna film it
as soon as I'm done filming this video
so look out for that very soon
one more shot of the on there Queenie
and I really like the way that it came
out it's just a nice natural everyday
look and it's not complicated you know
just the crease pat on the lid smoke up
the outer corner and you're done that's
pretty much it so alright get ready for
the last day alright my friends are you
ready for the final look look number
four this is probably one that is a
little bit different than what I
typically do this one I really felt like
I had to stretch myself to find a fourth
look and I can see like Kristin says
that this video is really hard because
it is it is hard because I felt like you
know there's only a certain selection of
colors that I will use all the time in
this palette these two here these here
these are like sometimesi kinds of
colors and I really don't feel like I
would use the mattes a whole lot because
I mostly use mattes for transitions I
don't really go for all matte looks I
tend to like my eyes to be quite
shimmery so what I decided to do is just
do an all matte look and see if I could
pull one off I'll give you one guess to
figure out what I put in my crease yeah
I put in mix of these two because there
really is no other option I set this
purple down all over my lid except for
the very very inner corner the very very
inner corner I lit it up a little bit
with this to try to give it some
contrast but really and truly if you
look at the tone of the
I just feel like there isn't enough
contrast there as far as that matte
shade really making it quite different
it is a little different but it's not
quite different I wish it was just a
little bit lighter for that purpose and
then for the outer corner I smoked it
out with this shade right here and then
for my eyeliner today I used the black
matte shade here for the eyeliner for
the lower lash line I put this shade
just all over the lower lash line and I
felt like some of this had already
fallen onto my lower lash line so I felt
like that was okay you know it still has
a little bit of a deepness to it if
there wasn't enough deepness just using
this I probably would have added just a
little bit of this on the lower left
okay so let's talk about that I look
first I'll go ahead and do the eyes
closed thing show you how it looks
close-up so you can see the eye shadow
that I used as eyeliner and how that
kind of came gave a little more of like
a little smudgy look compared to the pen
layers that I've been using all week for
this I wanted to do something kind of
in-between the loud craziness and their
really wearable yesterday so I feel like
it came out exactly the way that I
wanted to choose some pretty happy with
it okay let's talk about what else is on
my face so I decided to pair this with
the makeup revolution blush I wanted to
bring in more makeup revolution product
so you guys could see how those worked
as well this is the matte blush powder
in divine this does have a really nice
wear time it allows you to a work day or
school day it may be gone by the time
you're like eating dinner later on but
it does have a pretty nice lasting power
especially for a drugstore of blush and
it is this really pinky pinky pink pink
but mixed with a contour shade it's
really not quite as bright pink and it
is buildable so I really like that about
it and did use for my contour today the
Kat Von D shade and light palette I know
this is a very well-loved palette but it
honestly feel like there are some really
good less expensive options for contour
that I like just as much as this the elf
contour palette the makeup revolution
contour palette I really don't think
these are 100% necessary at this point
anyone else have staying power issues
with this palette I know I do unless I
put on like a setting spray which I hate
you
because I don't like spray and stuff all
over my face it feels gross to me I feel
like this is doesn't last on my face the
way that it's supposed to so I mean it's
a pretty good palette I mean the colors
are great but I don't know I don't feel
like it's so great for the price point
and I perfectly understand there's gonna
be a lot of disagreement with me on that
one
but I got to tell you what I think not
what I think you want to hear for
highlight is one of my favorite
highlights this is gilded honey by Laura
Geller this is a beautiful highlight you
guys see that poppin hole is poppin so
pretty really really nice pop a
highlight and a really nice lasting
power on this one and my lip combo today
I use Sephora's lustre matte long wear
lip color in the shade petal luster that
is what's all over my lips and then in
the center eye pops mixes extreme lip
cream in natural I don't feel like it
made that big of a difference but
because I did it I figured I would let
you know I only see like the tiniest bit
difference I really don't think this is
really worth it to add into the lip
combo it's primarily this that you see
now I'm gonna tell you a little bit
about the other products that I've been
using all week this is the tart ring
force of the sea foundation I definitely
have a love-hate relationship with this
stuff I love it when I put it on I hate
it when it's time to take it off because
it just does not look very good by the
time I have to take it off I feel it
accentuates my fine lines and wrinkles
on the forehead and I feel like it just
doesn't wear down very nicely I've heard
that that doesn't happen to everybody
but on my normal skin it just doesn't
wear down great it's not a terrible
products out bad product it's just not
one that I can say you must 100% go and
get the other thing is it is a
water-based foundation and I've had
really bad luck with mixing this with
silicone based primers where it just
breaks up really bad a water-based
primer like a lotion based primer it
works a lot better with this but there
is there are silicones in this
foundation so I don't know maybe it's
just me but I've definitely had issues
with this foundation it's it's I would
say on a scale of one to ten it's like a
six for me not great but not terrible
either for concealer I've been using the
next dark circle concealer I really like
this product a lot I use it all the time
for my under eyes it's got a very oily
kind of base to it so if
of dry under eyes this may be a great
product for you like I said earlier I do
have normal skin so this one works
really well under my under eyes I do
have some fine lines I don't find it to
settle into fine lines and it just has a
really nice coverage for me now I don't
have super dark circles so I can't speak
to it for super dark circles but for a
mild dark circle mild dark cut and
discoloration I would definitely
recommend this it's a very nice product
especially if you have dry under eyes
this product I have very mixed feelings
about this is the colour-pop brow pencil
in the shade dark and brown or black and
brown black and brown the color the the
print is already rubbing off my color
pop print always rubs off the packaging
I don't know let me tell you the product
inside is very very good but this is the
cheapest brow pencil packaging I have
ever seen they went bottom on the line
on this one for this plastic packaging
the big thing is is it's a little bit
difficult to roll up and then when you
do roll it up it does not roll back down
it's stuck wherever you put it so just
when you if you buy this don't roll it
up past what you need because it will
not go back down I do like that they
gave a little bit of room in the cap so
it doesn't get squished if you roll it
up too much but but still it just feels
extremely flimsy now the spoolie is not
bad the spoolie is fine as far as
bullies go but honestly I would
recommend the L'Oreal over top of this
one the L'Oreal I like it just as much
as my anastacio brow with this one the
packaging just makes it go yeah I feel
like it's gonna crack it feels bad but
if you can get past the packaging the
product inside like I said is really
good I'm gonna go ahead and scooch you
back for final thoughts so just some
final thoughts on this palette overall I
really like this palette a lot as far as
the quality of it the lasting power it's
just a really good solid drugstore
palette I've bought a lot of drugstore
palettes in the past year and this one
is definitely my favorite now just be
careful because not all makeup
revolution eyeshadows are created equal
I also bought the iconic one and I
absolutely hated it it was terrible
quality lasting power was horrible
application was pretty good the lasting
power was really really really really
bad so just be careful with makeup
revolution I
found that the ones in these pallets are
much better than the ones that are in
the plastic like ones you can see
through kinds of pallets that's my
personal experience there's always
different people with different
experiences I'm gonna express it again
if you love the iconic one I'm so happy
for you I didn't like it so I have to
tell you what I think but what I'm
telling you about this one as I do
really really enjoy it so I want to
