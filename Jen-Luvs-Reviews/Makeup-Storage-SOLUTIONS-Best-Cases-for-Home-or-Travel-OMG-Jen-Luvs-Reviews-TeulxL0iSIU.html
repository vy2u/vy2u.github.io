watching Angelica Nyquist the other day
and I'm hoping I'm not butchering her
last name but if you haven't seen her
channel she is super fab so she did a
video about why she unsubscribes from
different YouTube channels and some of
the things she said really resonated
with me and one of them was that people
do the same videos over and over and
over again and I definitely have some
series on my channel that I do over and
over again but I also want to mix in
things like today's video to give you
something different to watch there's so
much over saturation on YouTube and I
think today's video is really gonna be
different and I hope you love it as much
as I love this concept and I'm gonna
just tell you all about it right now it
is so windy outside oh my gosh like
hopefully I don't know if you're gonna
be able to hear the wind but it's insane
out there so today I am gonna be talking
about a makeup storage case that the
company contacted me and asked me if I
wanted to present these to you they did
send these to me but this is not a
sponsored video and there's gonna be a
giveaway I'm gonna tell you how to do
the giveaway at the end of the video by
the way skip ahead buttons down below if
you want to skip right to that so anyway
Lubell contacted me and I don't normally
accept videos for things like this but
when I saw the concept I really thought
that I would be interested in it I
thought that you all might be interested
in because we're always looking for new
ways and more efficient ways to store
the products that we have so that they
we can have time savers and you know not
clutter everywhere and I am currently in
the process of reorganizing all of my
makeup when I told them I would do this
video I was feeling super overwhelmed by
the products that I have and just not
knowing what to do with them I thought
that these would be perfect for that so
what these are is these are makeup
storage cases and you can use these just
around your house you can use them for
travel they are made out of fake leather
I forget exactly what they call it but
it's fake leather and then they
got a zipper pouch there's three
different sizes this is the smallest one
is the one that I'm gonna hold up and
what we're gonna do today is we're gonna
fill these with products in my
collection and then show you kind of how
what fits in which size you can decide
if this is something that you would want
for you and what it is is it almost look
like a camera case to me and then these
things pop out and you can readjust the
different sizes
for your different products which i
think is essential for a makeup person
because we all have different size
products and nothing is more frustrating
than you needing this much more space
for a blush and it just doesn't fit
right and that's like so we're gonna be
playing with this today and seeing what
fits in what and what sizes so there's
six pieces in here that you can adjust
and then up here you have a place for
makeup brushes I will say that this does
feel a little bit cheap up here but it
doesn't feel like it's going to rip
unless you're very very rough with rough
with it now on the side here you also
have a zipper this is a great place to
put pallets and this is connects with
velcro here let me show you the other
two sizes so this is the medium size
case and we're gonna I'm gonna fill them
so I'll show you the insides in a second
and then this bad boy is the large one
and you'll notice on the large one and
the medium one you do have one of those
suitcase strap things at first I thought
it was a pocket it's not a pocket it's
like a suitcase strap for travel and
these things I'm telling you they are
like rocks on the outside I mean I could
beat this thing and drop it down the
steps and nothing would happen to this
case I don't know if anything would
happen to the make up inside but nothing
would happen to this case I mean this
thing is super sturdy so now what we're
gonna do is I'm gonna change the view a
bit and we're gonna go zoom down and
we're gonna fill up these cases to see
what actually fits inside these things
so this is a small one this one's 29 77
you've got the the handle up here and
then your different compartments let's
start filling this baby up
I think that's pretty full I tried to
pack this as if I was going on a trip to
do a complete look so now it's time to
pack at the other side which is where
we're gonna put our pallets and our
brushes it's a little tight but it fits
I don't think I'm gonna be able to bring
in here two of these pallets I think I'm
gonna have to let this guy go it's not
gonna fit we're gonna put this guy in
there instead and I have to put a single
contour powder in instead because that
didn't work okay so I grabbed kind of
some brush essentials these can be kind
of traded out with different brushes
that I own got a highlight brush brush
that I can use for face powder I've got
a blush slash contour thing I've got a
highlight fan brush and then I've got
brow brush and different eye brushes and
let's see if that would fit
that easily fits my essentials but not a
whole lot more also it's kind of rushing
a little bit at the top some of these
face brushes are kind of getting a
little smooshed which I don't really
like looks like that is my complete pack
for the small case and what I can fit
let's go ahead and zip it up and make
sure it closes it closes very easily of
course I probably could have put a
couple more products in here jammed them
in but I don't really think that's
really very a very good idea to jam the
products in like that so so yeah so this
will be ready to go let's go ahead and
switch over to the medium we're gonna
take all this stuff put it in the medium
and then see what else we can fit
Oh tight fit but it works let's see what
else we can jam in here as you can see
it's already kind of full like it
doesn't have a ton of room left but
let's see what else we can put in here
alright I think we've got it full enough
so we did actually fit quite a bit more
and again there could be even more
packed into this side if I wanted to but
this is you know I'm trying to be
conservative and not overfill it so
let's go ahead and try the other side
and see the difference there the brush
has definitely have more room in this
size and this is like so much more room
for brushes and you don't even have to
use this for brushes you can add more
lipsticks in here lip glosses anything
that's long that you can put in here
yeah that's not going to fit oh maybe it
will no not quite too thick but that
will fit yeah definitely less squishy
therefore the brushes I prefer that
let's see if this baby will fit okay now
it's pushed all the way to the bottom
and you can see my hand is pretty deep
in there there's there's still plenty of
space here this way let's see if Kat can
come too
let me put Kat in first
cat can you come to hopefully it zips up
though because now it's super thick grab
some highlight palettes maybe Casey
Holmes going in and that's pretty pretty
full I might be able to fit a little bit
some more smaller palettes in there but
I'm not gonna push it
alright let's close this up Oh houston
we have a problem yeah that is not going
to work so these do not fit in doubled
on top of each other and they don't fit
side-by-side either they're too big to
fit side-by-side because what happens is
if I try to put cat in see if I can push
that in and then try to put this on the
side oh wait wait
yes we have a winner
and then let's see if we can put that
there it's Casey getting out yep wait
nope yep Casey can fit in for the next
round are we gonna zip
barely it's pulling it's pulling good
that is tight I don't think that that's
gonna be good for the zipper maybe if I
kind of push these guys up a little bit
within the inside I'm kind of pushing
them up let's try again there we go it's
very very tight though with all of that
in there but that's still a heck of a
lot of makeup and this is like this is a
good solid makeup collection in here so
that's pretty cool but you know what
we're going for the ultimate challenge
now with the biggest case of them all I
don't even think it's gonna all fit on
the camera at the same time all right
this bad boy is huge and I can't even
get my camera to be on the tripod tall
enough to fit this whole thing in the
frame so we're gonna have to do this in
pieces varium holy moly I mean I can
really only see someone keeping maybe
their entire collection in here or for a
makeup artist taking this for travel so
let's do the transfer and see how much
space is left
all right so as you can see there is a
ton of space left in here like a lot
the only thing about this here is that
you can't really move this without
taking all of these out because these
are one size so you got to kind of count
on this one staying the same and these
cases being the same length if you know
what I mean removing these is much
easier than taking this one out really
isn't going to be possible unless you
want to sacrifice all these compartments
here
well it fit well if it will fit Oh nope
its cracking its cracking no abort
mission
can you believe it took me till the last
bag to remember my sunscreen really Jen
really and just in case some mac fix+ I
think we're done I think I mean you know
you can see I could still put even more
in here if I wanted to jam it full again
I'm just not gonna risk jamming it
completely full but you get the idea of
how much can actually go in this I feel
like this is definitely might be
overkill for some people but maybe you
can fit you know your whole collection
could be in any one of these depending
on the size of the size of your
collection when I first started making
YouTube videos I probably could have fit
my entire collection in the smallest one
but of course everything is grown at
this point - now that we've kind of
filled the side let's see how much we
can fill the other side which we have to
bring Casey let's throw Casey in Casey
fits now hopefully this doesn't fall off
my table I try to do this now with this
one we've got moulds of pull pockets
we've actually got three pockets here
for brushes which is a lot
can't forget my honest Ozzy agloe kit
I'm gonna throw that in there
it doesn't fit this way but will it be
able to fit this way and still close
that's gonna be the question as you can
see I fit every single one of the
brushes that fit in the first case just
in this first compartment so let's add
somewhere and yes all my brushes are
dirty and that's okay with me
I've come to terms with the fact that I
am terrible at cleaning my brushes I
feel like if I try to fit any into here
that it's gonna end up getting way too
thick so I'm just gonna leave it just
filling these back one's up
you
I think we're full I think we're done
now the question is is this going to
close I don't think that these guys are
gonna make it just because I think
they're gonna be too poufy I don't know
we'll see
I could probably pit fit some more
highlight palettes and things in here
hold on a minute let's see how we're
doing for space here looks like we still
might be able to close let's try it and
we are closed whoa let's see if we can
fit some more bring this guy he can go
right there
okay I think we're at max now
I'm being pretty rough on this zipper
and it really does seem to be a very
heavy-duty zipper I don't see this thing
ripping or having any issues anytime
soon and that's that's my honest opinion
I mean if you want to be safe with the
zipper you might want to not fill it
quite as much as I just did but it is
zipping closed and I don't feel like I
have to force it the things really
really have you go oh to tell you that
but I think that this for me this bag
would be overkill this would be too much
for me personally I personally feel like
the medium or the small one are better
for me and my purposes but this may be
perfect for you depending on what you
plan on using it for especially if
you're a working makeup artist I think
this would be amazing so now one more
time here is the small full of products
the medium and then the large you know I
just realized now I have to put all this
stuff away that is going to be really
really really annoying so now you've
seen how the cases work what fills in
them maybe gotten some ideas of whether
these are right for you or not what size
you might be right for you I'm gonna
tell you a little bit about the giveaway
so Lou Bella was kind enough to give
away two of these cases whatever size
you choose whatever works for you you
can choose the like the small medium or
the large if you win the giveaway so in
order to enter all you need to do is
leave a comment down below just say
something nice it could be something
nice about your life it can be nice
about someone that you know it can be
something nice about be if you want to
compliment me but that is not going to
increase your chances of winning I
promise it's maybe something you enjoy
doing maybe something that you're
excited about in your life just
spreading joy and happiness the way the
giveaway winner calculator thing that I
use works is it only counts unique
comments so there's no real reason to
leave more than one comment unless you
just forgot to say something and you
wanted to add something else but yeah
that's all you need to do to enter and
the giveaway winner will be chosen one
week from today I will put it in the
video description I will comment back to
that person to let them know that
they've won I will do everything in my
power to contact
that person if you have an About section
with an email address then I can reach
out to you through email you know but if
you do not respond within three days
then I'm gonna be picking another winner
so that Lubell can move on with their
lives
with this but I very rarely have someone
not respond so just kind of keep an eye
in a week from now on your YouTube
notifications I'll put a picture of what
that looks like up here just keep an eye
on that number and just check that to
see if I've responded to you one week
from today so I hope you're as excited
about the giveaway as I am I know I'm
excited about these cases not just for
travel purposes but also for if I need
to move a group of items like let's say
I'm doing over a few video favorites
video I did this this past month as I
put all my monthly favorites into this
case and then brought it down for when I
was editing so that it was easy for me
to have everything all in one place and
there's so many uses for this when I
used to live in a rural rural small
house right before we moved into this
house our bathroom was like a closet and
there was no room to put my makeup so
this would have been great to lay some
towels down and just set this down into
the sink with all of my makeup in it
instead of a makeup bag where I just
dumped all the makeup into the sink
which was not the best way of treating
my makeup this would have been much more
functional in that situation so so yeah
