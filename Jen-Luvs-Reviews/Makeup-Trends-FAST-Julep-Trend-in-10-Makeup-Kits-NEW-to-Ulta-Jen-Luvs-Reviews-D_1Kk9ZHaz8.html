the brand new julep trend in 10 kits
these are going to be available at Ulta
this month
super exciting for julep as you may know
I have been a julep maven meaning that
I've been subscribed to their
nail-polish subscription service for
years I want to say I've been doing it
about 3 years and if you've seen my nail
polish back over there I would say about
50% of the nail polish is over there our
julep they're my absolute favorite nail
polish brands so when julep contacted me
and asked me to do a sponsored video
with them I was so excited to do it
because I have tried so many of their
makeup products through their julep
maven system if you have more questions
about the julep maven system I will put
the link to the website down below but
this video is all about their new
arrival at Ulta should these kits are
$39 apiece which breaks down to about
$10 per products so let me show you what
comes in them I'm also going to show you
a little demo of me doing the glam it up
cocktail party look which is what I'm
wearing on my face today if you watched
what sip and make up this past week it's
the same look I recreated it at least as
closely as I could before this video so
let's go ahead and start with the glam
it up one it comes with a liquid
lipstick a cream eyeshadow in a like
pencil sticky form a mascara and a
pencil eyeliner and when you open it up
it looks like this be careful when if
you get this it's gotten glue on the
back so it was like trying to get it up
but if you just kind of pull your finger
on the back it's easy to get up you just
have to cut up just no you're not you'll
need to rip the box you just got a pull
a little hard on the back and then it
comes with the trended 10 glam it up
little guy here and it tells you how to
use all of the products it's got the
eyeliner in here and this is in the
shade smokey plum shimmer and then the
smoldering eye shadow in orchid shimmer
and then the
length matters mascara and the soft
matte lips in law so that's what comes
in here I do have this kit as well this
one is the get glowing kit it's an
illuminating look in ten minutes this
one comes with again another card that
tells you exactly how to put everything
on and it comes with a blush stick a
highlighter stick lip crayon which is
like a nude shade and then the mascara
as well and again it's got all the steps
of how it should do everything so I am
wearing the highlight from here but I
think and then the mascara because it
came in both kits the blush that I'm
wearing is the same formula but it's one
I got in my julep maven subscription I
just wanted to show you how it went on
because the blush stick that comes in
here is like a quarterly shade and I
didn't like the way that it looked with
all of the purple it looks really bright
in the tube but it's not as bright once
you blend it in there is a lot of
shimmer in this though it is like a
bright goldish shift in there gold
shimmer shift so if you don't like
shimmer in your blush this blush stick
isn't going to be for you but if you do
like a little bit of shine on your blush
or if you like a highlight this can
serve as a blush and highlight in one so
you the lip product here that's in here
this is the almond nude cream and I'm
gonna do reviews of all these products
after the demo but that's the almond
nude cream and it's got like a
moisturizing core in the middle it's
very very hydrating alright so without
further ado let me show you how these
products applied to my face I'm gonna
show you that right now
all right so let's break down the
products that I use and I'm gonna do a
full review on how I feel about these
products let's go ahead and start with
the trending ten glam it up we'll start
with the eye shadow crayon there are
different brands that make this kind of
stick and to be honest with you this one
isn't my absolute favorite of all of
them that I own it does have a little
bit of shimmer and but it's not an
obnoxious shimmer but it does tend to
blend out if you if you pat it too much
or if you blend it too much it will
blend out but if you pack it onto the
lids like you saw if you pack it on the
lids you can build it back up once you
blend it out so it's just a little more
work then I would like it to be but it
is a nice color too beautiful color it's
very smooth and creamy to go on just be
careful with the over blending of this
product the eyeliner is also very nice
it's a very creamy gel like consistency
if you want a smoky liner and this one's
gonna be for you if you want like a
straight opaque really really hard stiff
liner this one is not going to be for
you it's a more creamy formula - more
gel like formula it's a more smudgy kind
of formula not a stiff straight line
kind of formula so depending on what you
like you may like this or not but you
know what you like better than I do be
off to take wet when I'm letting you now
and decide whether it's best for you
personally I really like it a lot for
that smudgy
look I didn't smudge this one too much
but I do like it for the smudgy look now
mascara I was pleasantly surprised with
the mascara I had tried the length
matters mascara and a different
packaging before and I was not super
impressed but I really think they must
have reformulated it because I was
really impressed this time when I saw
they had this mascara in there I was
like no bad review don't like this
mascara but you saw how it went on it
really does give nice volume and really
nice like the thing that I think really
tips this off is the the plastic brush
in here the it separates the lashes
really really nicely but the little
spokes on there out of which a column
the little
Bristol's us probably wouldn't call them
not spokes what are we talking about
bicycle here the bristles on here are
very short so like when you have like a
benefit they're real or something like
that the bristles are very long so it
tends to poke the under eyes and it
hurts this one does not hurt at all it's
really really nice I love the way that
it goes on I love the way that it
separates I mean it just
they must have reformulated it because I
don't remember it being this good I was
very pleasantly surprised yes thank
goodness I liked it yay because when you
ever sponsor a review you want to like
as much as possible so I did really end
up liking it and then the last thing in
this kit is the liquid lipstick now I'm
gonna tell you what I like it on liquid
lipstick it may be different from what
you like what I like is I like a creamy
formula I love the over liquid lipsticks
I love the the new bare minerals liquid
lipsticks the Gen nude lipsticks I like
the creamy formula I also really like
the tortoise lip paints even though that
one's probably my least favorite of the
ones I just mentioned I also really like
this it's a creamy whippy formula and
then I really like about this compared
to some of the more drying liquid
lipsticks the Kat Von D's the color pops
things like that is that the wear down
is very even so for example like right
now this is not kiss proof if I go like
that I mean it clearly shows up on my
hand but I find blot let me get a tissue
on my second okay so if I block this
away and kind of simulate what it would
be like if you wore it through the day
and kind of get off the majority of the
product so you're going about your day
you're eating you're drinking you're
wiping your mouth and I'm kind of wiping
a little bit you can see that it's still
on my lips and now you do it's really
sound like a commercial doesn't I don't
mean for it to be like that I just
really like this product and now you can
see it's not kissing off anymore because
I've gotten rid of the majority of the
wet product on my lips but you can see
that it's still there now if I take it
and I really wipe it's still there so
wears down very evenly of course the
more you wipe it it's going to go away
eventually but it's not blotchy looking
where some
the liquid lipsticks will kind of wear
off and they'll kind of crackle off this
does not do that it's a really nice
formula I was a big fan of the color pop
ones but now that I'm trying some of
these creamier formulas and really
getting into this formula I like these a
lot better than the more drying formulas
alright so let's talk a little bit about
the second kit this is the get glowing
illuminated look in 10 minutes again 39
dollars and you get the four products
inside the blush and the highlight I
wish they lasted longer they're very
very creamy they're very very easy to go
on as you saw I just Pat them in with my
fingers you could also use a stippling
brush I feel like the stippling brush is
a little more work but I feel like that
lasts a little bit longer when you use a
stippling brush so this one again like I
said before it does have shimmer in it
same thing with the highlight that
there's no glitter it's just the shimmer
but if you have large pores these may
not be the ones for you because it may
accentuate your pores but if that is not
your issue you will probably love these
this highlight is a from space
highlighter it is crazy it's really
really bright as you can see in a little
demo it's really bright lasting power on
these is about six hours for me which
allows me through a worker school day
but they do not last into the evening so
just be aware of that that you are going
to have to reapply if you want these to
last all day and then the last thing is
this lip crayon I'm gonna try really
hard to remove this stuff all right I'm
gonna like straight up remove this
liquid lipstick with makeup remover so
that I can show you the lip I'm having
trouble getting the liquid lipstick off
because it's just it's it's tough stuff
man alright I think I've got most of it
off though so this is the shade almond
nude cream kind of show you what that
looks like it's a very hydrating formula
it is not long wearing it definitely has
a typical wear for a lipstick the sense
of it is really really good it smells
very creamy cake like my only complaint
about it is just the wear time is not
there's no staining power or anything
you're gonna have to reapply every time
you eat any time like through the day
you're gonna have to reapply it but it
is beautiful it's very creamy it's very
hydrating like a match
earlier thought that hydrating core in
the center of it which is really nice
and it's a beautiful color very opaque
doesn't seep into the lines of my lips I
have a big huge giant crack here this
does not seep into that even after a
period of wear does not seep into my
cracks in my lips always crack someplace
oh no it's just the way my lips are I'm
just I've given up
like somebody lip balm but I've just
given up so this I don't have problems
with that there I also don't have
problems with it being patchy it's just
a really really nice color if you like
this nude color the last thing I want to
talk about in this video is the value of
these products now like I mentioned they
end up breaking down to about $10 per
product if you buy them individually
they are going to be quite a bit more
like for example the liquid lipsticks or
$20 each the the it's bomb lip crayon is
also $20 the eyeshadow stick is 18 the
eyeliner is 16 the mascara is 20 the
blush stick and highlighter sticks are
24 each so you are definitely getting a
good value if you had plans on getting
these individually in my heart I wish
that they had included a Polish just
because I love their polishes and it
would have made me really happy to have
seen a Polish in these but I can I can
live I have enough tulip polishes I
really need more but I do wish that
they'd included a Polish but you know it
would have just felt like it rounds in
and out but you know that's really my
only complaint as far as what they've
included in this because it really is a
good value if you were planning on
buying these individually but it's
really whether you have enough in these
kits that you're excited about to make
it worth it to you personally so that is
my review of the julep trend in 10 kits
exclusively at Ulta this month I will
put a link in the description of where
you can buy these at Ulta comm you
