Day recommendations I'm going to give
you the best recommendations that I can
possibly give you for your mom's
Mother's Day so whether you are
celebrating Mother's Day yourself and
you're trying to get recommendations to
people that you love or if you're trying
to buy something for your mom I'm hoping
to be able to give you some great
products that your mom will absolutely
love so what I did was I went on
ulta.com sephora.com and a few other
websites and I loaded up my cart with
over a thousand dollars worth of
products to give you some ideas of some
things that I think your mom would
absolutely love so let's go ahead and
get started I'm going to get out my
laptop here and let's go ahead and get
into my Sephora shopping cart so some of
these things I own and some of these
things I feel like just would make great
gifts because I've tried similar things
I feel like when you're giving a gift
there's got to be some kind of packaging
and presentation to it so it feels like
a gift so just giving like one liquid
lipstick or something it's kind of like
made one you can do if you're on a
budget that is not on this list but is a
great idea in my opinion is get an
Easter basket on sale like maybe a brown
one or something something that's a
little more neutral colored and put some
of the Easter grass that's on sale and
put that in the bottom and then put
inside some of your favorite makeup
products that you love tie a little bow
on it and your mom I think would
absolutely love that that's my opinion
you know I've never met your mom I just
have a feeling you know what your mom
likes and you think I think you can pick
out some good things for a gift basket
but I mean even some of these things
could go in a gift basket from ah first
thing are the sephora favorite sampler
kit those things are wonderful
especially the perfume samplers if you
know your mom loves perfume but you
don't know what kind of sense that she
may like there are a couple of different
options there's this one right here this
is the deluxe perfume sampler and you
get little minis of all the different
ones the cool part is is that they give
you a voucher so when you go back to us
a forest where you can trade it in for a
full-size of your favorite which i think
is awesome then they also have the
smaller ones where they give you a
little sample little
and you trade it in for a rollerball
those are the ones that I personally
like because I like to switch around my
fragrances so much I never use a
full-size fragrance so I personally
really like those a lot the only thing
is if mom is not the kind of person that
is going to go back to Sephora to trade
in her voucher or if mom's the kind of
person that mom loses her vouchers maybe
this isn't the best option for her I
personally really like this one as an
option because it gives her the
opportunity to pick something that she
likes if you have a dad that has also
been a mom to you and you celebrate
Mother's Day with your dad they also
have a men's cologne sampler as well so
along with perfume samplers they also
have makeup samplers which are really
really cool because you get to try a
bunch of high-end makeup brands but you
get the smaller like the luck sample
sizes or even bigger than deluxe sample
sizes sometimes sometimes are pretty
generous and when you get a cheap
product you don't really necessarily
need a lot in order to get a good
feeling for what it is and you get way
more than that especially for like the
highlighters and blushes and things like
that so this one is called the sunkissed
glow and it's pretty new I think it just
came out this week it's $45 you get a
ton of stuff it was like you get a
highlighter a bronzer primer another
highlighter a lip gloss a self-tanner
and a miss I mean there's so much stuff
in here it's pretty amazing to
definitely recommend that if that looks
like something your mom would like
there's also one if your mom likes
mascara
there's the lash stash to go this one
just came out recently and then there's
the give me some nude lip kit which I
just purchased now I do have a full
video of me trying on these lipsticks so
I will put a link to that down below but
one thing I want to give you a warning
about if your mom is a medium or a
deeper skin tone mom she may not like
this because there are a lot of lighter
colors in here if your mom is a lighter
skinned mom then she'll probably find
some more wearable colors in there and
less your medium or deeper skin tone mom
likes lighter shades because just it's
very lighter loaded on this version of
the give me some lip kit even if you're
not going Mother's Day shopping right
now they use
have these around different holidays
like the the winter holiday season and
things like that so keep your eye out
for these then as well so on some things
that I own as this right here this is
the Too Faced natural love palette I did
do a full review of this now this is
going to be for the mom needs like
eyeshadow for work or for a school day
she's in college this is going to be
your nice easy no thought all in one eye
shadow kit for natural makeup so again
full review down below if you're
interested in that another kind of one
and done that I've seen is still
available I've had this for a really
long time this is the Cavanaugh Quan
contour book version 2 I believe is what
it's called really really great for a
mom like simplicity so we've got a very
cool toned contour here we've got a
cream and a powder and the same thing
with the highlight this is a very
natural-looking highlight their
candlelight powder is not a super poppy
highlight so she's going to be able to
wear this to work without people being
like girl and her cheeks and blowing and
then there's a cream one as well but
there really isn't a lot of shine in
there this one's really nice for
brightening the under-eye and things
like that there's no like glitter or
anything in the cream highlight it's
just it's much more natural looking for
a highlight just to truly bring light to
certain places without shine and the eye
shadow is down here are fantastic very
easy to use if your mom is very
simplistic and just wants one look this
use wears the same look every day
doesn't want to have to think about it
just gets up does your makeup and done
these are it's a great color selection
for lots of different skin tones you've
got two shimmers two maps and it's just
a really wonderful all in one little kit
here very high-quality and it's a luxe
brand so give her a little bell look
there's also this little guide in here
as well there's a face highlighting and
sculpting guide shows are exactly what
to do and also a nice shaping guide so
definitely a nice gift for a very
simplistic mom doesn't need a whole lot
of frills for moms that want to get in
on the
lighting and contour kick the Australia
contour kits are fantastic they do make
these four light medium and deep skin
tones I have the light one I personally
really love this shade for me I use all
the highlight shades and I just use this
one for contour here
but really super high quality and I love
that are such a variation and options
for different skin tones another option
for a more mild highlight is the
hourglass palette you have three
different tones here and again not a
super poppy highlight very wearable very
professional she wants a little
something a little more glowy kinda you
know I'm a mom and I like my poppy
highlights the Sephora highlighting kit
is wonderful this is a luminizing
palette you get lots of tones in here
for lots of different skin tones
personally I don't wear the white I
think that you're very very fair you'll
probably be able to get get away with
the white you can also use these as
eyeshadows as well that's what I use
that one for you've got this nice bronzy
one for deeper skin tones lots of
variation in here and there very
high-quality definitely recommend these
also the Anasazi of glow kits as well if
you find one that you think is a skin
tone that your mom would like to urban
decay palettes that I don't own that
would be really nice for the wild crazy
mom the Urban Decay full spectrum
palette is currently on sale so for for
thirty two dollars your mom loves those
bright pops of color I've heard
wonderful things about this palette and
it's on sale which is super bonus and
then the Urban Decay Naked ultimate
basics the little ones are nice but I
don't really see them as being super
gifty so if she likes that basics and
you want to give more of a color
selection this is a really nice option
I've heard very good things but I don't
personally own it so now we're going to
move away from Sephora and we're going
to head over to also and they get into
my Ulta cart so there's a few things
that I do oh and let me show you this
first this one's kind of one of those
everybody loves this palette there's
very few people I've seen a comment
section of people that don't enjoy this
palette this is the auto salvia modern
renaissance palette but this one is so
incredibly pigmented so you're I
wouldn't get this for a mom it doesn't
wear a lot of makeup I would get this
for your makeup connoisseur if she
doesn't already own it just because it's
so punchy and pigman
it is easy to use once you're used to
using it but if she doesn't wear a lot
of eyeshadow it may be too intense but
it's really a wonderful very high
quality eyeshadow palette very easy to
get your hands on at this point you also
get this at autostar Gia's website as
well but she's really going to have to
let these warmer shapes to think about
like the shirts and colors that she
wears does she like these kinds of
colors have a nice mix of mash and
shimmers in here which is fantastic you
can go more of a neutral II kind of look
if you want to or you can get into some
colors with these oranges and kind of
purply reds and things like that so it's
got some nice variation in it and it's
just an extremely high-quality eyeshadow
palette it does come with a brush or
just my brush fell out I don't have it
anymore for your trendy mom that likes
to go to the movies the lorac Pirates of
the Caribbean collection I am working on
a full review of these this especially
the blush palette is so so good I have
never experienced lorac cheek palettes
before and I must have been missing out
if they're like this this is insane but
this has a lot of poppy highlights in it
so if she doesn't like poppy highlight
you probably don't want this got these
two mats here and then these shimmers
here but this thing I've been wearing
this every single day since I got it
except for when I've been testing other
things for videos every opportunity I've
had I've been using this and lasting
power is really good the shades down
here are very natural-looking on my
skintone this one here may not work for
everybody because it is kind of a
lighter to medium tone to it and it's
matte so if your mom is deeper than this
color and may not show up on her but
everything else works really well again
if your mom is deeper than this one
might not work as well but she could
always use it as a highlight on her eyes
too and these shades are just stinking
gorgeous I could see them working on
everybody this for really right here the
eyeshadow palette is your mom's got to
be willing to have this size hanging
around because it is really big and one
thing that's super cute is there's a
door in the side and you can take the
blush palette and put it inside the
little door so that kind of makes it a
little more compact and that you can
just have this and then have your blush
and your eyeshadow and everything all
together but I really like this again
I'm going to go in
my full review another time the
eyeshadows in here are fantastic quality
she's going to have to have some
experience with eyeshadow to know what
to do with these things because it's not
laid out as nicely as let's say the Too
Faced palette or the kavanah Quan it's
it's not as easy to figure out what to
do with it but if she's got some makeup
experience the quality in here is
wonderful and if she likes Pirates of
the Caribbean - that's that's a bonus
there is an eye liner in here I haven't
used it yet so I can't speak to it but
full review coming on this on the
channel subscribe so you don't miss it a
hidden gem that I want to mention that's
at Alta or the julep trending ten kits
those things are wonderful gifts because
you get so many different things in them
so like for example we get this one
that's a modern romance kit this one has
a cheap product liquid lipstick and eye
shadow crayon and a eyeliner and their
liquid lipstick formula is extremely
comfortable it's very very nice I really
like the cream cheek product it's very
easy to you just kind of go blam and
then Pat it out with your fingers super
easy to do same thing with the eye
shadow you just kind of draw all over
the place and Pat it on and then you can
layer eyeshadows over it if you want or
you can just leave it alone and the eye
shadow pencil is very easy to use as
well and all of them are like that this
one here is the wurr kit kit it has a
mascara and two of those eyeshadows Stix
and then a eyeliner pencil and the last
one they have up here is the trend in 10
glam it up kit and this one has a liquid
lipstick and eye shadow it's a deeper
color eye shadow a mascara and an
eyeliner pencil but these are really
really nice kit and they're very
inexpensive considering how many
products you get in there and I really
love the quality of julep makeup I have
been a julep maven subscriber for years
I love their nail polishes and when they
started to come out with makeup I was a
little bit skeptical but they really are
very very nice and finally a couple of
other websites that I was looking at
that you can't get at Sephora or Ulta
the first one is products by the balm if
you go to Cole's com where the balm calm
you can get this highlighter palette
called the man eyes or sisters and I
just really like those highlighters
mary-lou manizer is like legendary I
don't have Cindy Lou anymore because I
broke her but she but I did enjoy her
while I had it
and then I do have betty-lou and then
Marylou so with those just it's just a
really nice highlight slash bronze
palette and it's just very high-quality
along with that the meet matrimony
palette is also really really good for
those matte eyeshadow lovers who also
like a little bit of color a little bit
of fun and their eyeshadow palette I
don't have the meet Matador that looks
really interesting if it's the same
formula you might want to check that one
out too but I can't speak to it because
I don't own it and the last one is
makeup brushes there's a few places that
I really like to buy makeup brushes the
first one is very easily accessible you
can buy them at Walmart they're the
motor brushes by royal and langnickel
they're the most high-quality brushes I
have ever found for that price point I
really really enjoy those so if you're
kind of in a pinch and you want to get
something quickly all Walmart do carry
motor brushes your mom wants to try
something interesting and unique the
prismatic face brush set is really fun
to play with I really like two big ones
out for Foundation and then I use the
ones that are a little bit smaller for
contour for blush for concealer things
like that I don't really use the little
small one but the other ones I use all
the time they're very very good
especially for the price Real Techniques
brushes are also really really good and
pretty dependable in quality if you want
to go a little more high-end I
absolutely love Sigma brushes they're
really really good I know that there's a
lot of sponsored content that goes
behind Sigma but I really like Sigma
brushes I've had very bad luck with
morphe brushes so I can't personally
recommend them because I've never tried
a morphe brush that I like but I also
haven't tried a lot of morphe brushes so
maybe it's just been bad luck in the
ones that I've chosen to buy and try so
for higher-end the Sigma brushes and
then for less expensive either real
techniques or the Moda brush line from
royal and langnickel they're all really
really good so that is it for my
Mother's Day recommendation / gift guide
I hope that you enjoyed it and found it
helpful I'd love to hear your
recommendations down in the comments
below or if you bought something from
the video then I would love to know what
you decided to buy I let's just talk in
the comments I love talking to you all
