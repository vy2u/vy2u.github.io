the Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation I
haven't done a foundation review in a
really long time my big thing is eye
shadow reviews so this is me getting my
feet wet in the foundation review
department I hope you like it I hope I
do alright so let's go ahead and jump
into the all the deal about the Marc
Jacobs remarkable foundation so this
foundation is $55 you do get 0.75 ounces
which ends up being $73 per ounce which
to me is quite expensive when I think
about you know ounces of foundation
usually an ounce of foundation is what
you get in a bottle but this is not a
full ounce if you want to compare this
to some of the higher-end foundations
the Giorgio Armani foundations are
between 64 to 67 dollars per ounce so
this is actually more expensive than
those the girl all lingerie Zappo
foundation is sixty three dollars per
ounce so this is more expensive than
those if you count per ounce but because
this is a serum foundation it is
supposed to last you longer than a
typical foundation would it does come in
22 shades from ivory light to cocoa deep
they do recommend for dry to normal
complexions to use this with a
moisturizer or their coconut face primer
what's different about this foundation
is when you open it up you unscrew the
top and inside is this little dotting
tool here it reminds me of like a large
dotting tool you may use for fingernails
but it's big it's big so what you're
supposed to do is you're supposed to dot
this onto your face and then you blend
it out with a brush they do recommend
their Marc Jacobs face brush 3 which I
don't own I used to own the tube but I
lost it I don't know what I did with it
so I use a different brush which you'll
also see in the demo you're supposed to
apply one to two dots for a sheer to
natural coverage and then three dots for
a more full coverage I did use quite a
bit more than that but let me go ahead
and show you why let's get into the demo
right now so we're gonna test the Marc
Jacobs remarkable found
this is in the shade beige light before
I put that on I'm going to put the
primer on that I have that's closest to
the Marc Jacobs primer I don't own that
one this is the Too Faced hangover
replenishing a face primer so I'm gonna
put that only on a half of my face so
let's go ahead and put it on my right
side that is my tester side that is
always my tester so that way I know what
is happening and I never forget which
side I've been to what on that's the way
I apply primer I just kind of smash it
all over my face with a pore filling
primer it is helpful to kind of press it
into the skin and I can even press this
a little bit but I honestly don't see
much difference when I do that but we'll
do it because I know people like to see
that now I also have somewhere in my
arsenal the Marc Jacobs face brush too
but for the life of me I can't find it
so we're gonna use the angled kabuki
brush by beauty junkies it's the closest
brush I have to it it's not quite as
dense as that brush but it's pretty
stinking close the foundation does have
a dropper here so I'm gonna put equal
amounts on both sides
I'm going to go Blanc Blanc tip Blanc
Blanc
dip put one on the middle of the nose
bulk and we're gonna put one on each
side of the chin both won't because I
want to make sure I have the same amount
so you can see the coverage okay here we
go
now this is a bit yellow on me but I am
okay with that just kind of blend it
into my neck it'll all work out in the
end so you can see the coverage even now
the difference between the sides that
have Foundation and don't have
foundation the coverage is very good
while I'm blending this let me tell you
a little bit about my skin I do have
normal skin meaning that I have abnormal
skin meaning that if I have a very
little bit of dryness right here on my
eye
randomly but other than that I do okay
as far as oiliness dry spots things like
that I don't see I see a little bit of
freckles but I don't see any redness at
all I do have a little bit of redness I
don't see any of that you can see I put
it on my lips on purpose so you can see
the coverage over top of my lips you can
see how it may cover more pinky spots or
red spots on your skin but overall I
think it looks really really good
it definitely doesn't look like skin
though like that it you can definitely
tell that I'm wearing makeup but I
wouldn't say that it looks cakey at all
so I'm gonna go ahead and do the rest of
my face and I'll be right back but I do
want to kind of talk about how much
foundation I use I used quite a bit of
foundation because I found that one to
two dips into this is not enough to
cover the entire face you kind of run
out as you go over the face so I did
choose to use more I also wanted to show
that full coverage and this of it
because I feel like a lot of people are
looking for a really good full coverage
foundation so it's possible that for
this wear test I did apply too much
foundation but that's just what I chose
to do based on my experience with this
foundation so far so let's go ahead and
zoom in really really close and I'm
gonna show you how this foundation is
wearing it so far so it has only been
about two and a half hours since I put
this foundation on but I've been under
these lights the entire time and I'm a
little bit sweaty well I'm gonna be
honest with you I'm a little sweaty so
I'll show you kind of how it's wearing
the full coverage miss is still
definitely there I do feel like it's
kind of crumbling a little bit on the
sides of my nose I feel like it's doing
some weird stuff on my chin and I do
feel like it is accentuating my pores
let me get up even closer so you can
really see so here is the side of my
face
and let me show you where it is on my
nose and then there is no chin you can
kind of see what's going on there I do
feel like it's also creasing in my fine
lines here but again that may be due to
the amount of product I put on to try to
get that full coverage look before I go
about the rest of my day I do want to
tell you a little bit about the
ingredients in this product overall it's
a very clean product you may want to
watch out for is the fact that it does
have dimethicone in it dimethicone can
clog pores for some people so if you
find foundations with dimethicone to
give you skin irritation or clog your
pores definitely stay away from this
product just so you know that methyl
cone is labeled a3 on Environmental
Working Group Candida has classified it
as expected to be toxic or harmful and
is suspected to be an environmental
toxin so next ingredient is something
called PG 10 dimethicone it's also a 3
there contamination concerns for this on
ewg it says it's a derivative of
dimethicone containing an average of 10
moles of ethylene oxide now I am NOT a
chemist I don't even know what 10 moles
is or if I'm even saying moles right
maybe it's male like you know when like
chocolate moly I don't know let me tell
you a little bit about this ethylene
oxide that there is a small fraction you
know of this in there and there are
irritation concerns for it it's also a
known human carcinogen as identified in
Candida it is a banned ingredient in
Canada so we don't know how much of this
peg tens I'm at the cone is in the
product and we don't know how much that
translate into at least I don't know how
much that translates into of this
ethylene oxide and how much of that is
in the foundation so it may be a
negligible amount that we don't even
need to worry about but again I don't
know that for sure I'm just trying to
let you know what I know and as much as
I know but other than that that's it as
far as this foundation and things that
turned up as red flags on Environmental
Working Group so so I don't feel like
that's too terrible so now that I
I've presented that information to you I
am going to take a break from the camera
for a minute actually I'm not I'm gonna
film one more video and then I'm gonna
take a break from the camera for a bit
and we'll come back in a few hours and
show you how everything is wearing I'm
not going out today I'm just gonna be in
front of the lights and then I'm going
to be kind of wandering around my house
for the rest of the day so we'll see you
in a little while I realized in between
check-ins that I never told you what
time it was but I was checking in before
I finished putting on my foundation at
about 3:30 p.m. I was getting videos up
and editing and squash and drama on the
Facebook group and all kinds of stuff
was delaying the beginning of me putting
on makeup today so about 3:30 I finally
finished putting on my foundation so it
is now 10:07 p.m. which means that it
has been about six and a half hours
since I put on this foundation I feel
like from a distance it looks really
good I feel like it still looks super
full coverage but when you look at it up
close I feel like it's starting to break
down in places but you really have to be
looking close so let's get all up closer
you can sit all up close up in yo face
so I feel like there's a little bit of
breakdown on my lip right here which may
have been from wiping my mouth from
eating I do feel like that everything
else kind of looks the same as it did in
the last check-in my chin seems to have
kind of worn off a little bit and my
nose definitely looks patchy if you
notice like right here it looks like
it's got foundation but then on the tip
of my nose the foundation seems to be
gone check the corner of my nose right
there so you can see how that looks but
I feel like I'm just kind of nitpicking
at this point like I don't know am i
nitpicking this is my first foundation
review in a really long time am i
nitpicking on this or is this really not
that great I don't know yeah look it up
close my nose really does look kind of
terrible and just just in case you were
wondering I do have the coloured raine I
shadow palette on my eyes if that video
has already gone live I'll go ahead and
put a link to it down below but yeah the
ah shot
a gun right about now I can also see if
you look at my forehead wrinkles the
foundation is kind of settled into my
wrinkles here and also a little into the
fine lines there which I do not like at
all and there's definitely you can
really see those fine lines underneath
my eyes so that's the six and a half
hour check-in I will check in with you
guys one more time before I go to bed in
about two more hours and then I'm going
back close it's late and I need to go to
bed I need to set my bedtime at midnight
and I need to be done with that so we'll
check in and we'll see you again around
midnight I ladies and gentleman so it is
now what time is it twelve eleven in the
morning and I'm the only wake it's
pitch-black out and I'm tired and my
eyes are red I was just up editing who
we're breaking up even more it hasn't
been that many hours since the last
check I think it's only been like two
hours since the last check-in but it's
not looking good ladies and gentlemen
let's go a go ahead get up back up real
close to personal all right here we go I
know still looks horrid lipsticks
breaking down a little bit but that's
not what this video is about I got a
video coming up on this liquid lipstick
eventually just not in it
I feel like still from a distance she
wouldn't be able to tell a whole lot is
wrong with my face but definitely I
don't know the nose is looking pretty
stinking bad cheeks don't look so
terrible except for that my pores are
just kind of screaming I don't even have
that big of pores but I feel like it
accentuates my pores I don't know man I
don't know I really want to love this
foundation but oh no now I was thinking
about it does say on the website that
this is a 24 hour foundation so I've
decided in the past five minutes that I
am going to sleep in my makeup I
want to see what this looks like in the
morning just out of pure curiosity and
I'm scared I'm a little scared I think
my husband's gonna be a little scared to
wake up and see my hot mess of a face
when he wakes up in the morning I
thought it was all my eyeliners all were
my foundations all hop off and I don't
know we'll both see but you'll see in a
couple of seconds cuz it's gonna be
morning in a couple seconds for you but
it's gonna be about eight hours for me
good day good night I'll see you in a
minute
bye good morning my friend
so it is I'd say it is 1008 in the
morning I laid in bed for a little while
cuz you know it's Christmas vacation or
winter vacation right now so I laid in
bed for a little while and I let a bunch
of people end up a Facebook group about
a hundred people made my son some
breakfast
I made some myself some coffee I checked
the Internet's and now I am here so
let's check the foundation to see how it
did through the night now I do want to
let you know I do wear sleep headphones
that cross my forehead I also wear an
eye mask so let's look and see how we're
doing here the foundation is definitely
still there especially on my right cheek
where I use the primals remember I used
primer on half of my face so the
foundation is definitely more there here
than it is over here it's pretty much
washed off off here but I do sleep on
this side as well so I think that might
have been bad for the foundation too so
it's probably a combination but there's
no way to know it might just be because
I slept more on this side than this side
last night which I know for a fact I did
so honestly that's probably it's
probably not even the primer but I am
surprised at how much foundation is left
on this side so we're at 19 hours of
wear right now I think I'm done on the
wear test I don't be I can bear to wear
this makeup to lunch with a girlfriend
of mine so yeah I'm gonna take it off
but before I do I'm going to show you up
close what it looks like all right let's
check so let me just say
I'm wearing the color drain I should
have palette look how amazing that I
shadows still look I warned I'm asked
about it my eyeshadow still looks pretty
decent
but right here that's breaking down this
cheek was the one I slept on why this
one still doesn't look too terrible
there's the chin and nose definitely
breaking down I definitely want to make
sure that this is an accurate review for
you so I'm going to wear this foundation
again today but I'm gonna use less of it
I'm gonna use closer to what Marc Jacobs
recommends to use the one two three dots
of foundation I'm gonna go ahead and
take this off and I'm gonna refit this
on in a bit and I'll show you what it
looks like with alright so we are back
for day two of the wear test yesterday I
pile it on a lot of the foundation today
I used a very little bit I put one drop
on each side I did find it difficult to
get the foundation to move all the way
at my forehead I started on my cheeks
and on my nose and it definitely did
some coverage on there but I couldn't
really get the product as much on my
forehead as I was like unlike yesterday
where I did use my Coty airspun over my
face today I did not put any powder on
my face just trying different ways to
wear this let me examine real close you
can see it's definitely not very much
coverage and see a lot of freckles very
different than yesterday you can see my
forehead has very little coverage at all
this is the recommendation for a lighter
to medium coverage I do definitely think
that it is a lighter coverage we're
gonna see whether it hangs out today and
how it does so we'll see you in a little
while oh my phone actually what time it
is
today I'll actually show you what time
it is it is 12:01 on a minute my
husband's texted me you don't need to
see all that hold on a minute it is 12
18 so we'll see you back twelve we'll
see you back about 6 o'clock yeah let's
do 6 o'clock let's do a 6 hour wear test
see where we are and then I'll show you
again before I go to bed so see in a
minute alright my friends let's check in
see how we're doing here alright let's
see so it is 704 p.m. I'm a little bit
late yeah we just have a little break to
around the nose a little bit on the chin
and still a little bit on the tip of the
nose as well so let me go ahead and show
you up close now that I have my opinion
I'm going to let you see and share your
opinion so this is the seven our face so
you can see like right there it's
breaking down on the nose breaking down
a little bit and the chin but the cheeks
look really good it definitely doesn't
look like it's seeping into my my
wrinkles here as much as it did
yesterday with more foundation and it
doesn't look as cakey here either
so definitely less like they said on the
ad before it you know direction they
said less is more and I definitely think
so I just wish I could have gotten it to
fuller coverage I don't know do I need
to do this on a third day with three
dots I don't know I feel like it's
laughs I'm pretty good so this is at the
seven hour mark so think typical school
or work day and from a distance you
can't tell that anything's breaking down
but if you look up close you can
definitely see some breaking down on the
nose and the chin and around the nose so
if you have oily skin this may not be
the foundation for you so this is what
we're gonna do it is like I said it's
707 now so we'll check back in I guess
like another well whenever I go to bed
so another around midnight I guess seven
eight nine television another four hours
so twelve hour wear test and see how
we're looking yeah let's do it all right
I'll see you in another four hours all
right my friends final check-in of the
video this is it I'm done I mean and
this is what it comes down to is this
foundation is insanely expensive so in
order for me to be impressed with it
it better be expensive looking by the
end of the night and it's been twelve
hours all right and it's and I have to
be completely honest it's very rare that
any foundation will look good after
twelve hours of wear this foundation
does claim to have up to 24 hours of
wear so I'm just gonna show you first
what my face looks like and let you
decide what you
thinking that I'll tell you what I think
so here's the close-up
yeah the wrinkles got to check out those
wrinkles up close and personal and the
hair between my eyes hashtag no filter
okay so this is what I'm thinking
all right now I did put on the light to
medium amount of coverage and I feel
like my cheeks still look pretty good as
far as that lighter coverage especially
my right cheek where I have the
foundation primer now I have not slept
at all like I did with the more fuller
coverage amount of foundation so it's
definitely not due to me pressing on one
side more and then another the primer
side definitely looks better and I did
use that two-faced hangover RX or
hangover primer on my face so that just
goes to show that it does make a
difference because this side is
definitely more faded than a side I feel
like it's completely gone from here
which might be due to wiping my mouth
after eating things like that I feel
like the bridge of my nose it's
completely gone I feel like it's taking
up in between my brows taking up a
little bit on my forehead so I mean at
this point is it a good foundation yeah
that's a good foundation is it a $73
anounced foundation new not for me at
least if you've had a great experience
with this foundation I would love to
know about it in the comments down below
because to be honest with you foundation
concealer mascara a lot of those things
really are unique to the individual
everybody's amount of oil production is
different sun exposure wind exposure
sweating amount I mean there's so many
factors that cannot be controlled and
that may apply to me but may not apply
to you that's one of the reasons why I
don't do foundation where you use a lot
but I did want to give you my personal
experience with this foundation so then
maybe you can apply something from my
experience to you so that maybe you can
make a judgment about whether this
foundation is right for you or not it's
a very hyped up foundation on
YouTube and I really felt like I just
wanted to give you more information
about it so now you can do with it what
you will again if you love this
foundation I would love to know in the
comments below if you hate this
foundation I would love a no pun in the
comments below let's see if we can find
some kind of common ground in the
collective brain of makeup awesomeness
to know who this foundation works for
for me it's just okay I definitely would
recommend using it with a primer but you
know it's I don't think that it's worth
the price point if this were a drugstore
foundation I would be very very
impressed but at the price point I'm not
as impressed as I wish that I was so I
want to thank you so much for watching
this video I hope you enjoyed it again
this is my first time doing a foundation
review in a long time so I love your
feedback down below thank you so much
for watching mad love and I'll see you
in a video soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
