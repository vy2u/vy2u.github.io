like a room without a roof because I'm
happy
oh hi welcome back to my channel it's
the happiest time of the month it's my
monthly favorites and fails countdown uh
if you're just as happy as I am hang in
or if you're not hang in hopefully we
can bring some joy to yo we're getting
started or right now if you are new to
my channel you are new to the countdown
and in this countdown I count down from
the worst product I tried this month all
the way up to the best products that I
tried it is a whole lot of fun I ripped
the idea from Cassie from thrift thick
who does her pyramid I always I give her
credit down under all of my videos she
has her name down there as someone that
inspires me so if you've never checked
out her countdown definitely check it
out let's go ahead and get started with
number 10 okay this is officially the
worst product I tried this month and I
did get it in PR but I do have an
alternative and the reason why I had so
much faith in this product and why I'm
so upset about it this is the in
mark-anthony strengthening row long anti
breakage oil I had tried this one before
and I really like this I've got stuff
rolling away this is the coconut dry
styling oil I thought this was going to
be like that this one I really like this
one is like instant grease ball I don't
know what is happening with it is
definitely not even close to the same
formula it says it's supposed to help
prevent breakage to restore strength and
beautiful shine I have to admit I only
used it one time because no that's not
true that's not true
I used it twice because I wanted to make
sure I put my hair through it twice and
both times I had to wash my hair out
actually no that's not true either one
time I used dry shampoo and tried to
just deal with it the other time I
actually physically washed it out the
second time I used it
it's just straight-up oil into the hair
I think this would be something that
might be good if you want it like maybe
to spray it on at night and then put my
hair up like in you know a bun or
something and then go to bed you know
put a towel down on my pillow or
something and then wash it out in the
morning
maybe that would be good but it's just
it's straight-up greaseball where this
doesn't do that I mean the ingredients
are very different this is called a dry
styling wheel where this is called an
anti breakage oil so they're different
formulas they're just in the same
packaging with a different sticker but
this is really nice it does add some
nice shine to my hair without it looking
oily but this one's very nice this one
has been awful for me number nine
some of you were gonna be really upset
with me for this you're gonna be really
upset and I'm really sorry because I
know I know for a fact that some of you
really really like this product this is
the cover effects shimmervale and this
is the shake amethyst I got it in my box
to try when I unbox this i swatched it
on my hand I got so much advice on how
to use this and the big thing was was to
apply it kind of like a steel uh shimmer
what does that called magical glitter
shimmer stuff that you put on your eyes
that I absolutely love so I did that did
that I applied it overtop of eyeshadow
and I couldn't get it to be opaque I
couldn't it was like a topper and I
wanted it to be more opaque so I built
it up and what happened when I built it
up is he creased so bad it was a
horrible by like six hours my eyelids
look like they had cracked it was awful
so okay I probably applied too much that
was probably my fault so one day I put
eyeshadow primer I think but Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer on one side no primer
on the other just put a light wash of
color on both sides totally more like a
topper than a an opaque eyeshadow which
can be beautiful for some people but the
lasting power was really bad on me as
well it just did not last me through the
day the primer side was slightly better
than the no primer side but not enough
to make a difference for me to even
slightly recommend this and and I know I
know for a fact there's gonna be people
that disagree with me on this and I'm
really sorry but I can't speak to your
experience I can only speak to mine and
mine is been really awful for this
product so that's what I gotta say next
is a product I've been trying actually
for a very long time and it's taking me
a really long time to just give up and I
think I'm done I think I'm giving up
this is the essence i heart color
intensifying eyeshadow base and it does
in
- five shadows some but I find that
again it makes my eyeshadows crease some
and also it doesn't help with the
lasting power of my shadows like other
eyeshadow primers do and it's very
disappointing to me I don't feel like it
makes my eyeshadows more vibrant I just
I and I've tried this so many times
countless times I don't even know how
many times I've tried it and it just
falls flat on me every single time and I
don't know why this works for some
people and it doesn't work for me but
again I can only speak to my own
experience and I just don't like this I
don't I don't like it and I'm sorry I
don't like it at all this is the
Maybelline brow precise about fiber of
volume it's very similar to the benefit
gimme brow concept in that it is
supposed to kind of color in your brows
it's got fibers are supposed to color it
in I do have it on my eyebrows today
okay I like the way it makes my brows
look in that it doesn't fill them and
completely it gives me a more natural
look it just it makes them so they're
not quite as sparse and it looks more
natural because it's just adding on to
the hairs that I already have there
which I personally like I really like
the applicator overall it's kind of a
tiered not to your drop I guess like um
I don't know like a lemon shaped skinny
banana banana is probably better than
lemon shaped I guess I don't know saying
banana
I mean know what kind of shape a flower
petal there we go let's call it a flower
petal and I just run it through my brows
it can be a little bit messy to apply
like if I miss at all then I have to
wipe but it's very easy to wipe off and
my big complaint about this is that it
makes my brows very very crunchy
they don't look fussy anymore I tried to
rough them with with an eyebrow brush
but they just like like stick my brows
to my face and like they just flat and
stuck and I can still feel it it's it
still feels terrible there's no like
obnoxious set or anything to it but ever
I kind of like the way it makes my brows
look I just don't like the way that it
feels and I feel like it needs some
fluffing afterward which I wish I didn't
need to fluff if we can just leave out
the fluffing part then I think would be
good so it's not terrible and I will
continue to use it but it's not my
favorite this is what I have on my eyes
today this is the wet and wild color
icon
shadow palette and not a basic peach
this is all I have on my eyes today it's
over - except for I topped it over the
Mac Paint Pot in painterly I just wanted
to mute out discoloration so I did that
and then I put this on I have which
shades I have of course the blue all
over my lid and then I have in my crease
this shape here and this shade here a
little bit of this on my brow bone but
it didn't really show up
I've used this like 4 times I think at
this point and the shades go on really
really beautifully my only complaint is
not only complain I have two complaints
one complaint as the lasting power is
not phenomenal it'll last you through a
good six to eight hour day without
fading significantly but then it just
really starts to not look as good so it
does need some reapplying at that point
if you want to take it into the evening
but overall I really really like this my
only other critique is that I this
transition shade is really really weak
there isn't hardly any pigment to it and
it might be because it's like you can
see my finger it's so close to my skin
tone that that may just be me it may not
be the problem with the eyeshadow it may
just be my particular skin tone and
because it's so close to it but overall
I'm really enjoying this palette I'm
thinking about picking up other
eyeshadow palettes from the line because
I do like the wet and wild color icon
eye shadows I don't typically reach for
them very often which is part of why I
haven't really bought many but I did buy
this specifically for the dupe part of
my dominant Cosmetics latte palette
review and then I realized the shade
wasn't really a dupe and I really I
found the perfusion palette and found
that one was a lot more doopy so I
didn't end up using this for that but
I'm very thankful I got it because it is
a really good palette last month I ran
this brand through the ringer I have
something very positive to share with
you about this brand I got a bunch of
stuff in PR from this brand and they've
really really liked this this is my
favorite thing that I got these are the
Ilia Beauty blush sticks these are
actually called multiples I believe I
have the shades a fine romance and
tenderly yeah they're called multi Stix
and if you did see my dominique
cosmetics latte palette review you will
have seen this one this one is called a
fine romance let me I really like about
these as they go on very very strong but
they're very easy to blend out so if you
have a deeper complexion a lighter
complexion you can blend it to whatever
you personally like
lasting power is good in the video I
don't feel like you could still see it
at the check-ins as well as I could see
it in person I feel like the lights kind
of washed me out so I wouldn't hold that
against the product because I feel like
most people aren't filming or in front
of cameras all day where they're cheap
product would be washed out but lasting
power is not phenomenal but it's still
really good and I do think that there
are very good products and I definitely
would recommend them I almost didn't
include this I think I've been putting
this off because I thought it was
limited-edition and I thought that you
weren't going to be able to get it
anymore but then I looked on safar's
website and it is still available this
is the tarte skin twinkle volume 2
lighting palette this is so good this is
so good I am shocked it does have a
vanilla scent I can smell it already so
if you don't like the scented products
don't get this I am wearing on my cheek
on this side this shade right here which
is called daylight I have two
highlighters there's another highlighter
coming I have that one on this side but
I have the daylight one on this side
every time I wear this no joke doesn't
matter where I wear it whether I wear a
YouTube video where we're at my daily
life I get compliments on this
highlighter this shade right here day
light the other shades are also very
beautiful
I find that candle light is a little bit
too deep for me but it makes for a
beautiful eye shadow so even if you're
my complexion if you feel like this is
too deep you can use it on your eyes and
it's absolutely beautiful all of these
are beautiful on the eyes as well
lasting power is excellent
it's really really good lasts me all day
long and that's rare for a highlighter
for me and this is just it's just a
fantastic palette especially this shade
right here is just perfect it's so good
so so so good you knew this was coming
somewhere and here my domini cosmetics
latte palette I did do a full review on
this like I've mentioned like nine times
at this point it's a really really good
eye shadow palette I do like I said in
the video I do wish that she had been a
little more creative in the foiled
shades because I feel like these are
very interchangeable but the quality of
the shadows is very very good I love
that she did a gradient here of light
medium and deep shades to play with it
goes along with the warm trend that a
lot of people are really real
loving and it's just a really really
good quality eyeshadow palette I am so
looking forward to the lemonade palette
that's coming out and seeing what
shadows are in that because this is this
is really really good a full review will
be linked down below if you want to just
skip to the nitty gritty just go to the
video description and click down to
where it says full review and you'll get
kind of my full thoughts because it is a
really long video it did three wear
tests and greeny analysis all that stuff
is in there so it's everything you could
possibly want to know about this palette
but just the cliffnotes of it for you
now is that I love this it's really a
very nice palette the creativity was a
little bit lacking on the shades but
other than that absolutely love it next
up was one that was a big surprise to me
I didn't expect to really love this and
I know this brand just keeps surprising
me over and over and over again I did do
a full review on the collab line I will
link that down below for you and then I
guess after I did that review collab
decided to send me a little bit more of
their product and this was the standout
product of these stuff that they sent me
some of it was just kind of like meh
it's okay but this one stood out as
being amazing this is their it looks
like a foundation doesn't it this is the
filter it is a highlighting liquid this
reminds me so much of the backup
backlight the not bacala is a backlight
the Becca liquid highlighter so much of
it but at a fraction of the price and it
lasts all day long it's absolutely
beautiful like I mentioned it's this
shade right here that I have on my cheek
and it lasts a really long time goes on
very easily what I choose to do that I
find works best for me personally is to
tap it onto my cheeks blend it in a
little bit with my fingertips and then I
apply my blush over top of it not over
top but like I put my blush on later
because it is a cream product I like to
lay the powder on over top rather than
underneath I feel like it makes a
prettier look so that's what I do with
this and it's absolutely beautiful in
this shade is gorgeous if you like those
champagne highlights really really
pretty in the packaging he believed this
is like drugstore price with this
packaging I know I can't it's gorgeous
I need number one I gotta thank my girls
raw Beauty Chrissy for this one oh my
gosh I have been looking for lashes that
are more natural-looking
are they starting the construction out
there again they're like doing some kind
of crazy yard work out there so if your
noise please excuse mmm
but Rob you Christy oh my gosh if you
were not subscribed to raw Beauty
Christy you need to be you need to be
she's hilarious she's amazing so Christy
had been talking about these Koko lashes
and how amazing they are I have a set in
the box this is set 103 I'm wearing 105
on my eyes now and my big issue with
lashes is always that the lashes are
always too big they're too much
I feel like big lashes overpower my eyes
they make it so you don't see my eye
look you don't see my eyes all you see
is lashes and I feel like they make my
eyes look smaller so I was looking for
some really good lashes that don't
overpower my eyes and just give a really
beautiful longer lash effect I found it
I've absolutely found it they do make
some a little bit more wild styles but I
chose some of their more natural ones
and I am loving every single pair that I
got I will link it down below not link
well I'll link the website down below
but also tell you the ones that I've
tried so far I think this is the only
one I haven't physically put on yet the
one o3s but I think I've tried all the
rest of them that I bought I do find
they're a little finicky with lash glue
like I use my house of lashes lash glue
that I really really like with it and I
the House of lash lash glue does not
like them but my ardell lashes go that
I'll also link down below really does
like these I feel like the Ardell really
likes the very thin bands that's like
these and they stay on beautifully with
the Ardell they also dry really quickly
because it's a very very thin band so
they're really good beginner lashes I
feel like the more advanced lashes are
the ones with the thicker bands because
sometimes they're really hard to bend
and they're also harder to get to stay
on your eyes so you have to really get
it to like stick and they pop up and you
know I feel like these are great for
beginners for people that are new to
putting on lashes and people they just
aren't great at it you know like me so
now these are tied with my inky minke
lashes as my favorite favorite favorite
lashes the inky Mickey lashes are
designed by Sabrina who's a youtuber but
those are a little more wild so these
are definitely gonna be my favorite
natural go-to lashes at this point and
Sabrina
I'll get the wild ones from her so
that is it for my favorites and fails
