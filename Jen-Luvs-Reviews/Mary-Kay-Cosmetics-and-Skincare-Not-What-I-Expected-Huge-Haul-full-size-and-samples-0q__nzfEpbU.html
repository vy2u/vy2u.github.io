booklet so let's see what's in my two
little goodie boxes they feel pretty
heavy alright let's see oh boom so photo

it's a mystery sample first thing that
popped out with a little foil pack of
time-wise firming eye cream I will
always try a cream happy about that

here I'm opening up my cool Mary Kay
samples that I got from my new friend
Jennifer ooh I got an Eau de Parfum
dance to life what are you talking about
just dance to realize you can just dance
to nothing now
all right let's see what this smells
like ooh that wasn't supposed to come
off like that I think I did that wrong
sorry Jennifer I ruined your spray hmm
hit you with floral turns to sweep it
still floral little flowery for me but
I'll try it
these bags are so cute I think I'm gonna
keep these back is that terrible if I
keep these bags boom what's this more
hacky packs botannical effects hydrate
smooth on clean face and neck using
upward strokes okay we'll do that
and another botanical effects mask a
cleanse a freshen and another Oh
time-wise microdermabrasion holy gosh
Olli I don't need a microdermabrasion
but I will pass this on to my friends
who may like it better than me okay most
of these are mineral bronzing powders
that seems like that would be difficult
to use to get you know a contour off of
one of these little swatches watches so
Desert Sun sand stone bronze diva here
let me swatch you swatch one so those
are the swatches that came out I don't
know it might work they feel really
smooth sure whoo all right ooh we got
highlighting powders in pink porcelain
there and then this one is pink Stardust
there cool these will be fun to play
with oh this one's a fool well probably
not a full-size but it's a point
16-ounce mineral bronzing powder and
sandstone so she gave me a bigger one of
this maybe this is full-sized I don't
know but it
really nice those are pretty light but
that's okay we'll work it out
oh no it fell out yeah so those are
pretty nice little tiny bit orange II
probably won't be good for contouring
we'll see this one feels like it's got
some substance to it so we have cream
lipstick quite get how this works I
guess it's got like a little like
applicator and then a little tiny bit of
lipstick this is pink satin this one is
sheer blush this one is apricot glaze
this one is black cherry and then we've
got really red this one goes with my
hair look totally matches the hair
totally matches the hair and then I got
a Botha's cream lipstick oh yes okay
what color is this my dear what hot
mocha Thank You Jennifer very dark brown
not typically a color I would normally
wear but the thing about dark colors
though is you can mix them with nudes of
other shades and then work it out so let
me swatch it yeah very dark brown I
don't think I would ever wear this color
on its own but then if I do something
like let's put some bright pink on it ah
let's see what happens mmm see I mean we
can we can do things to work with this
we can work with it blend those babies
together we can work with it we can make
something interesting out of this you
guys know that I've seen my videos that
I'm very big on smell on lipstick smells
like a lipstick no fancy schmancy sweet
smell or anything but that's okay this
is an eyeliner draws a very nice line
soft not the blackest black I ever saw

stuff like that like a nice sampling of
all kinds of stuff okay what is this

only I remember this container and I
loved it
I'm gonna have to open it later cuz I'm
running that battery here but this is a
lightweight moisturizer oh it's a flat
top brush it's soft and it's pretty
dense I wouldn't say this is the most
dense brush I own now at this point okay
so here's the elf flat top the elf is
definitely more dense than this and then
this one is the excuse the blush enos on
this this one's definitely more dense
the everyday minerals
but it feels like it will work it's just
not as dense as these two that I already
own but that's okay we will work with it
