sales time are you ready I am so excited
to share with you the best products I
try this month and the worst products
and everything in between the countdown
starts Cal town not cow town the
countdown starts right now if you've
never been to one of my favorites and
fails videos before I do things a little
bit differently we start off with the
worst product I tried this month and
countdown all the way up to the best
product I tried so let's go ahead and
get started with number 10 this is a
product I've been trying for a while for
months and I'm finally giving up on it
this is the apple cider vinegar hair
rinse by DP hue and this is a famous
hair product I think like one of the
Kardashians or somebody uses this
somebody's super famous and I just can't
with this I just can't I can't do it it
is supposed to be a shampoo and
conditioner substitute with colored
locking technology that gently removes
impurities so I tried this in
replacement for my shampoo and
conditioner and my hair was a mess I did
here you could use it kind of as an
in-between shampooing kind of thing so
if you're just washing your body but you
don't want a shampoo you can use this
instead that dried out my hair really
badly I mean this has just been a hot
mess for me so I just decided to abandon
it and I'm not gonna use it anymore and
I'm I don't even know who to pass this
on to I will start offering this up to
my friends to see if they'll use it but
this was a big note for me if you have
used this and you liked it please let me
know in the comments below so I can
target which one of my friends I'm going
to give this to because this has just
been next one is a big big bummer for me
I'm so sad that this is the way that it
is this is the new Kat Von D super brow
and that is a very accurate definition
for this I got it in the shade dark
brown I thought about getting one of the
fun colors that she came out with but I
knew I wouldn't ever use it and for the
price point it was really just for fun
purposes and it's just not functional
for me to spend that much on a brow
product just for like using it once or
twice
so I thought the dark-brown would be
good for me this stuff is like paste
it's like dipbrow amped up to the tenth
degree I mean it is just it's so intense
it is pasty so it makes it very very
difficult to get any kind of eyebrow
look except for an Instagram brow so if
you really like those block brows this
is a product that's for you it is the
super brow and that's all you're getting
you're not getting anything looks
anything close to natural this was a
huge fail I just I can't get it to work
again if you have tips for me on how you
use this and make it look a little bit
more natural I mean I'm not expecting it
to be super natural you know we're not
gonna I understand it's not meant for a
natural brow but I can't like I can't
even get close even if I just dot it on
a little bit and then try to spoolie it
out it looks patchy and terrible and
this is a huge note for me now we're
getting into products that I don't
dislike but I don't like them so I don't
enjoy them this is the bee Hydra by junk
by drunk elephant this has some amazing
ingredients and it the ingredients in
here are phenomenal I'm currently
working on my full drunk elephant review
they sent me a ton of products not
sponsored that I'm working on trying out
I tried this for quite a long time and
my complaint is not with the ingredients
or the effects of it my complaint with
it is the texture of it when you put it
on it never at least for me it never
completely seeps into the skin so it
always leaves this like goopy feeling on
my face and the last thing I want when I
go to bed and lay my face down on the
pillow is for my face to stick to my
pillow it is the grossest feeling and
you know if you know me I do not like
textural things I can't use setting
sprays I can't it can't stand anything
on my face that has a significant
texture and this has it just feels
sticky on my face forever like all
through the day it never seems to
completely seep in the only way I can
use this is if I wear it under makeup
because I feel like the makeup kind of
helps mix with it so that it's not so
intense I tried using different amounts
of it but the problem with using less of
it is then I can't get it to spread all
over my face so
I mean it's just unfortunately this one
is going to be a no for me just because
of the texture of it not because of the
ingredients themselves what I did switch
over to is another product that I'm
trying I just started using this and not
that long ago so I'm not ready to give a
full review on this but the texture of
this one is so much better it definitely
seeps into the skin better this is the
protein II polypeptide cream the way it
dispenses is so cool you push down on
this top here and the product comes out
of this little hole and that keeps the
product contained in here without
exposing it to light or air and I've
been really enjoying the texture of this
one and also it also has some really
great ingredients in it so hopefully I
can get that review up to you the drunk
elephant review up to you and the next
couple of weeks that's the goal but so
far I'm liking this one better than this
one next is when I was a little late to
the game on but I'm really happy that I
tried it it's very very fun this is the
toothpaste toothpaste
man can I speak today the toothpaste
glitter pop peel off eyeliner and
they're not kidding
it does actually peel off it's really
fun to use it's fun and it's got a
significant amount of glitter in it so
the glitter is really really there the
only thing is because it has that peel
off ability so at the end of the night
you can just kind of peel it off of your
eyes because of that if you can feel it
or at least I can feel it all day long
on my lid it's got kind of a tightness
almost like wearing a sticker on my eye
all day which is a little bit odd a
little bit distracting but it's not a
deal-breaker for me it doesn't feel bad
enough that it really bothers me another
thing I wanted to mention is that the
brush on here is very very thin so it's
easy to get a nice thin line and it's
also easy to build up the thickness as
you go which I also really like it's fun
and if you like this kind of product I
think you'll really like it
because it's the peel off you don't have
to worry about it smudging throughout
the day which is great I also don't have
any glitter fallout on my cheeks through
the day with this and it's even pretty
just on its own you know using one
eyeshadow over the lid that's similar to
my skin tone and then putting this on as
a liner with some mascara is so so
pretty and fun
and really enjoying this so I mean it is
lower down in the countdown because I
like so much of this other stuff better
than this but it is really good and I'm
liking it just not perfect see I feel
like I didn't have enough bad product
this month because this is not a bad
product this is a really good product
but it seems like it's so lowdown just
because I like some of this other stuff
just more than that so this is the k'kaw
mario palette I was going to do a full
review on this palette but by the time I
could have gotten to it people seemed
like they were kind of over it and so I
feel like I kind of wasted my money on
this because I don't feel like I'm going
to reach for this very often it's very
similar to a lot of things I already own
there isn't anything super unique about
this palette at all but the performance
of it was very good I was very surprised
when I touched the shadows I was kind of
like no no about this I don't know if
this is gonna work I touched him swatch
the most calling yeah but when I
actually used it on my eyes I very much
enjoyed using it the shadows were very
blendable lasting power was very good
and if you like this color scheme I
would definitely recommend checking it
out price point is insane especially
with shipping the shipping of it is
crazy along with this I think it cost me
over $50 for this palette which is
outrageous but it is a good palette I
just wish I had bought it you know you
forget that where you're like you buy
something and you know that it's good
but it's like why did I didn't need that
why did I buy it the reason why I bought
is because I was gonna review it and
then I didn't review it so it was a
total waste of my fifty some dollars
it'll be nice for comparison with other
palettes like I'm I'll use it for duping
purposes and things like that but other
than that I'm probably not gonna reach
for it even though it is a really good
palette it is I have to say it is number
five is another palette that I really
really like a lot it's the nudie
patootie by Laura Lee I very much
enjoying it especially the matte shades
the matte shades are like perfection
they're so so good as far as the quality
the blend ability the pigmentation the
lasting power all of that where this
fall's for me is the glitter shades and
I did do a full review of this palette I
did a first impression and a full review
so if you're interested in hearing more
about this palette I will link those two
videos down below
but I just have I have glitter fallout
through the day on my cheeks no matter
what glitter glue I use I just can't get
it to stay on my lids and I'm still
having that problem even after I filmed
those videos this palette does have some
shades that are unique to my collection
bear is very unique to my collection the
closest thing I have is from the peach
palette but that has some glitter in the
background so I really have nothing
that's like this bear shade I also have
nothing that's like jaybird and like I
mentioned in that video J part is a
duochrome and it is so fun and so
gorgeous and I really really love it
I've created some fun looks with this
some easy wearable looks with this and
I'm very much enjoying it's a very high
quality palette overall it's just that
glitter thing is killing me
and also I get a lot of transfer of the
glitter up onto my brow bone through the
day which I don't like but in my
comments section people have told me
that they don't have that problem with
glitter falling on their face through
the day but their glitter glues work
fine with this and they use some of the
same ones that I use so maybe it's just
me I don't know overall I'm very happy
with this purchase I'm very happy that I
have it especially for the matte shades
and yeah it's really good palette but it
definitely has things that I wish were
just a little different next up are two
highlighters that I have very much been
loving they are so good they're from the
brand pop looks pop luxe is a brand
created by a man named nadie and lady
also has a YouTube channel that I am
absolutely in love with
if you liked good thorough honest
reviews and AD is a great place to go
but I could not watch his videos around
my kids there's a lot of things there
are very adult in his commentary about
products so definitely keep that in mind
if that's not your style you're not
gonna like his YouTube channel but I
personally adore his YouTube channel I
love it I laughed the whole time and I
feel like he does a great job with his
reviews he also has a cosmetic company
called
pop looks and what I thought from there
as I got two highlighters I got this one
in double life it's a peach that shifts
gold the other one that I have is the
black ice shade now this one is very odd
okay so it looks gray but then when you
get your body heat on it it turns white
and that's why it's called black ice now
this one if it's in a hot
I just want to let you know ahead of
time it will just be white but you can
cool it back down by using a little bit
of ice on the back to cool down the
product if you really want to see that
gray shade but really it's just more of
a novelty the gray shade the white is
what you're gonna see on the face anyway
and if you're just looking for the
performance of the product that's what
we're dealing with here
they're very blinging poppy from space
kinds of highlighters there are
definitely a unique formula in that
they're pressed very hard you know how
when you use a lot of highlighter you'll
get kick up of product that does not
happen with these which is very very
weird this one is a little bit more
granule where this one is just really
smooth it's very odd it doesn't even
feel like a highlighter it gives you
like a glow a sheen to it the lasting
power on this formula is really really
good the only people I feel like would
not enjoy these would be people that
just don't like that bling in from space
look they're really really nice and the
fact that they don't have that powder
kick up I know it's gonna be very
attractive for a lot of people I know
Nate he's currently working on an
eyeshadow palette I believe it's his
first eyeshadow palette and I cannot
wait to see what he comes up with really
really excited for it when we get into
like three two and one they're typically
products I just can't stop using that
they've just pulled me in this month and
I just I can't stop won't stop you know
this one is the brand new L'Oreal
paradise enchanted scented blush the eye
shadow palette has been good and I've
liked it but it hasn't pulled me in the
way that the blush has I am wearing the
blush on my cheeks today it is gorgeous
on my skin tone absolutely gorgeous it
gives just a light peach flush to the
skin and it's just a really nice blush
and lasting power is really good as far
as the scent it is less sweet than the
Too Faced scent it reminds me of if you
got some kind of peach mixed drink where
you had some kind of peach
mixer in the drink that's what it smells
like to me but the point of a makeup
product is not the scent itself but the
lasting power and the performance of it
and this has been performing very very
well for me I'm really enjoying it
number two is a product that was almost
number one but then I thought of a
number one
I liked just a little bit better than
this this is the color pop concealer
this is the shade light and it is really
really nice for me as being just a
little bit lighter than my skin tone if
you were in our weekly chat this past
weekend we talked about concealers and
how some people like them a little
lighter than their skin tone some people
like them the same as their skin tone I
prefer mine just a little bit lighter
because I'm mostly using it for adding
dimension to the face for lightening my
under eye rather than concealing itself
so this shade is perfect for me for that
this reminds me so much of the Tarte
shaped tape just less cakey I've used
this two different ways I use it where
I'll put some on and then I'll blend it
out with a brush and then tap it in with
my fingertip I've also used this with a
beauty blender I personally prefer the
first way spread out with a brush and
then Pat it in with the finger tips that
has been the best way for me to get the
coverage that I like I feel like a
Beauty Blender kind of it makes it just
a little bit weaker and it doesn't give
me the look that I enjoy but overall
this has been fantastic for me I love
the consistency of it it doesn't crease
in my my little fine lines that I have
under my eyes it doesn't crease which
makes me super super happy and I have no
complaints about this it has been
wonderful and I can't stop using it it's
been fantastic and my number one product
this month is my hair extensions that
I've been wearing over the past I guess
month and a half I think I got these
middle of April at IMATS
I'll show you the box for them they're
by XI and it's called the flip and go by
Shiloh hair extension it's a hundred
percent remy human hair and these cost
me $400 and at the time I was like oh my
gosh $400 that's insane
but I'm telling you this has added so
much confidence when I'm filming with my
hair extensions and when I go out on a
date with my husband with my hair
extensions in I just feel so much more
beautiful I don't know what it is about
having thicker fuller hair I think it's
because I've always been so
self-conscious of my thin hair I used to
have much thicker hair when I was a
teenager and then as I got older when I
had kids I lost a lot of the fullness of
my hair and I miss that so much
so this has brought that back for me and
I'm getting a little choked up because
it just it really just means so much to
me to look in the mirror and see fuller
hair it just looks beautiful to me there
are a lot of brands that make halo hair
extensions this is the only one that I
have ever personally bought if you own
halo hair extensions that are natural
hair extensions I would love for you to
leave your suggestions in the collective
brain down below so that we can learn
from you a reason why I'm saying you can
definitely get these from a different
brand is the retail price on these is
$1300
which i think is insane and they do sell
natural halo hair extensions
for much cheaper on other websites
I think $1300 is insane just to tell you
a couple of other things that I really
like about them I love how easy it is to
put on it takes me about two or three
minutes to put them on and it takes me
seconds to pull it off overall it's very
comfortable they don't feel super
weighty like it doesn't feel like during
the day I don't feel like it's giving me
a headache or anything you know like
headbands can give you a headache it
doesn't feel like that at all the only
thing is is it does feel a little itchy
sometimes in the back because of the
lace back there but overall it's very
comfortable to wear and that's a lot for
me to say considering my thing with
textures and just the amount of
confidence that this has given me is
definitely what makes it deserving of
the number1 spot this month if you've
tried any of these products or if you've
tried halo hair extensions I would love
