favorites and fails I have so many
favorites veils it's just crazy I've
gotten too much stuff this month just
too much stuff so I'll ask them to show
you so let's just go right into it and
we are going to start with hair face
kind of stuff and we'll work our way
into make a product so first favorite is
kind of an incomplete favorite because i
lost the top to it but it's the batiste
dry shampoo I've tried so many dry
shampoos I've tried Oscar blondie I've
tried swab I've tried everything but
this is by far my favorite and the
reason why it's my favorite is because
it works really well and because it
doesn't leave as much of a white cast
like you don't have to work with it as
much to get it the white to go away and
it just works really really well
honestly do not buy the Oscar blondie
one is ridiculously expensive don't buy
it it's not worth it it worked the worst
out of all of them I've you I'd feel
like the suave won't work better than
that one it just left more of a white
cast but still this one yes definitely I
actually just got the brunette one but
i'm still trying that one out so i won't
let you know my new friend jessica that
i will link her channel below she's
awesome she likes the brunette one so
i'm working on that one and i will let
you know if that won't let if I like
that one better than this one okay on to
face to face wins and one face fail so
the first face win is this L'Oreal
collagen moisture filler um day cream
now this stuff smells so sing good like
I put this on in the morning and I just
feel like it makes me feel awake it
makes me feel like I'm just ready for
the day like I'm not even kidding like I
don't know what it is about the smallest
stuff but it just smells so crisp and
clean and just oh and I love the way it
feels in it boy it's just moisturizing
and just but not over moisturizing like
I don't ever feel greasy or anything
like I mean it's just it is to me the
this is my holy grail day cream period
this stuff is awesome I got this at my
local grocery store it was a clue on
clearance for half off and I'm really
hoping that I can find it again once i
run out of it because i don't know if it
still exists or not the other wing came
out of my new beauty test tube one of
the few things that i've tried multiple
times
times and really really like which is
this Sookie face exfoliating foaming
cleanser this stuff smells so sweet and
good it's like lemon look lemon and
sugar amazingness and oh my gosh you put
it one and it exfoliates and all that
but if you this is really sick but the
best part is if you actually get a
little bit in your mouth they don't it's
like lemonade like it's like mmm like I
thought that I want to eat that the
cleanser I kind of want to eat the
cleanser but I don't eat the cleanser on
purpose I promise it doesn't do anything
spectacular for me but I'm just really
really enjoying this stuff for the
lemonade aspect of it in the middle of
my shower believe it or not my fail is
also from l'oreal and it's the l'oreal
paris youth code youth regenerating
skincare foaming gel cleanser this dries
my face out like crazy um I just don't
enjoy the way it makes my face feel it
stings my eyes if it gets in my eyes a
little bit it tastes terrible like I
mean it just I just don't enjoy this at
all I will not be purchasing it i'm
going to try to use it up but as long as
i keep getting more face products so for
cleansing in sample boxes and things
it's gonna take me a long time he use
this bottle up cuz i don't like it it
seems cheap that's what it is it just
seems cheap next moving on to nails i
have just been loving like the sand
polished thingies I don't have very many
but I just oh my goodness so these are
the two Sam polishes that i own i only
own two this one is by julie gee and i
really like this one this is from the
gumdrop collection and it is called
blueberry fizz the other one that i have
is as oil 1 this is called pixie dust
that this one is glittery but it is
doesn't have the big glitters like the
julieg and honestly I kind of like the
julieg better than less and it's about
half the price but I do enjoy this one I
would recommend it this one is in the
color Miranda it's just like a true like
deep berry pink and it's just like a
strawberry pink and it is just beautiful
I love it um I had it on my nails for
about a week before this and it was very
chip resistant along with the joy g1
both very chip resistant really really
into those I don't know why I just want
to touch them all the time like it just
tactile and I love it I love it next up
on two eyes all right we've got eyeliner
on this eyeliner palette from lorac was
part of that candy said that they had
for Christmas I got it on hautelook for
like super cheap it was just on her look
again I think for $28 for the whole set
I kept some of them gave some of them
away and giveaways but this eyeliner
said it took me a while to warm up to it
but I really really like this they're
just super creamy and beautiful and
there's tons of swatches if you google
it there's a gazillion squawks watch
this so I'm not going to spend time
watching it but I mean really it is
super beautiful so if you can get your
hands on this set I would highly
recommend that and I'm hoping that there
are other gel liners if they but have
other gel liners are the same formula
but I would bet that they probably are
and I would definitely try them if I was
in the market for more gel eyeliners
which I always have you know it's one of
those things that I'm always in the
market for you know like there's certain
things you just never have enough of an
gel liners for me is something I just
could never have enough of also for
eyeliner another favorite for this month
is the essence stays no matter what pen
liner I'll show you the tip on that um I
excellent just draw myself but it's a
very fine point and like honestly it
really does stay no matter what I mean
I've never had something live up to her
name as much as this does and my friend
prissy from prissy and pink she was like
I don't like that line again you know
why I don't like that liner is because
when I take off take it off my makeup
remover it actually leaves a shadow of
liner on my eye and I agree with her it
really does do that but personally that
doesn't bother me because I put on
eyeliner every day so having like a
little bit of a black shadow on where my
eyeliner was does not bother me and i
love the control and i love the point on
it as far as when it's going to dry out
i have only
had this for a week or two so I I don't
know if this is going to dry out on me
quickly so don't hold me to that but I
mean it was only a few dollars so it was
worth it for me to try it so if you're
in the market for a pen liner I would
recommend this one if you don't mind
that shadow it leaves once you try to
take it off alright finally on to the
gazillion other eye products I shadowy
kind of products that I have one thing
that I did a minute ago was I shot some
I swatches of these color tattoos now I
had a couple of people that I watched
their videos of these color tattoos
before i bought them these are the new
summer ones i bought four of them the
one that i went i watched before i went
was on less suree Joe I think it's how
you pronounce her username she is so
adorable I definitely recommend you
check out her channel i will put a link
down below to her channel she's
wonderful I got the ones she recommended
that I could find I couldn't find all of
them but I went against her
recommendation she didn't really like
this mint one very much but I got it
anyway so basically the mint one was
very spotty putting it on didn't really
like that one a whole lot the coup crush
one is really a light blue also pretty
spotty the purple one I'm starting to
warm up to because now that it's been
open for a few days it's not quite a
spotty but again this one was really
oily when I first opened it and I did
not like it all it's starting to get a
little bit better but i probably
wouldn't buy this one i wouldn't
recommend this one either the only one
that i would actually recommend if you
like this color is this blue one in the
Blue paradise really and truly this one
is the only one that truly has a nice
opaque color that goes all over your lid
and just looks gorgeous and really has a
true color to it now and a similar cream
eyeliner fail I don't know why I keep
doing this to myself I just don't know
why I keep saying elf do me right do me
right you know please help me do
something good for me the elf preme
shadow I mean the stuff is just horrible
okay so it this this one this pink one
is just straight up oily I was hoping to
use this cream color for a base
and it is just I mean it's slimy it's
it's like I mean you might as well be
putting olive oil on your eyes and this
this one is not even pigmented hardly at
all I mean it just big big fail on this
elf one I don't like it at all the last
fail is something that I'm quite
surprised at and people probably will be
mad at me about this fail but it is the
Urban Decay um stargazer I shadow from
the new moon dust shadow line I wanted
to love this and and it does have a
purpose and its purpose is to be a
glitter it's not its purpose is not to
be a shadow I tried it wet I try to dry
out it's a glitter it's not a shadow one
thing that is good about this compared
to the other urban decay glitter shadows
is that this one does not have the
fallout that some of the older urban
decay shadows had so that is a positive
about this but do not buy this if you're
looking for a gold shadow it's not um so
just be forewarned these are twenty
dollars i got this in my etsy bag for
contributing videos to the FC website i
would say i would pay seven dollars for
this maximum not 20 you know but i'm
really happy to have it i'm thankful i
just i was disappointed in just the
shadow property of it the final shadow i
wanted to show you is the one that I'm
wearing today and it's by bare minerals
and it is called passionate plum and it
is just a gorgeous matte purple color so
it's just a gorgeous matte if you can
see it I have it up in my crease the
lighting in here isn't super great but I
have it up in my crease and I love it
this shadow looks beautiful with the
meet Matt nude palette I use it with
that all the time and it's just the
perfect deep purple and it transfers
onto the lid purple a lot of times
purple shadows will end up looking gray
when you blend them with other colors
and things but this one really stays
true to its purpley plum color and I
love it so those are my favorites and
