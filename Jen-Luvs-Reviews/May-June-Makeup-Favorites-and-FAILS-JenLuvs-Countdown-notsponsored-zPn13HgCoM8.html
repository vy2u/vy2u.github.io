favorites video I know it's a little bit
late and I feel bad about it crazy end
of the school year i'm wrapping
everything up being a teacher i'm
quitting my job and I'm gonna do YouTube
full time and I'm super super excited
about it and I want I'm thinking about
doing a video about why i'm stopping
teaching if you think you might be
interested in that i'd love to hear your
thoughts down below or if you feel like
it's just not something that should be
on this channel but anyway I that's why
this video is super late so I apologize
and I'm not going to bore you with a
back story anymore let's get into what
in the world are my favorites this is
the countdown it's not just my favorites
it's the most terrible products as well
we start with number 10 which is the
worst product I try this month and we
work all the way up to the best product
ID you tried this month and that I've
been loving so let's go ahead let's jump
into number 10 all right number 10 worst
product I tried this month is Pacifica
skinny-dip crush and lovely natural
beauty eyeshadow trio Oh My lordy oh my
lordy was this bad this was so bad to
the point where i tried to use this for
filming and it didn't barely look like I
had anything on my eyes it's just a
really bad quality product and I feel
bad about it because I root for Pacific
I want reciprocal to do great but I
really like their skincare better than
their makeup I'm learning this every
once well I'll find something
makeup-wise that I enjoy from them but
it's super super super rare this was
just not pigmented enough for me if you
like supernatural looks then you may
really like this it was easy to work
with but the pigmentation is not enough
for my personal taste so this is a big
no for me number nine is a high-end
product that's brand new to sephora and
is the milk makeup gel brow pencil i got
this in my first sephora play box and i
didn't get the second support play box
because of my idiot self not paying and
switching my credit card over so I'm not
reviewing sephora play yet but
eventually i want to but this was
something i got in my first one and i
really don't like this brow pencil the
color is great lasting power is great
but it is one of the stickiest goop
yes brow pencils I've ever used it feels
so heavy on the Browse it feels horrible
on the Browse like it just takes the
brow hairs together and it's just goopy
and sticky and wet and I just I hate it
I absolute it and I hate to say that I
think that milk has a lot of things
going for it I love the branding of it I
haven't tried any other products but if
you're going to put something a
subscription box milk this is my advice
to you make sure you put your best foot
forward because now I'm judging your
brand based on this brow product that is
so goopy and I don't know anybody that
enjoys brow products like that's maybe
there are people that like them I
personally think that it's terrible but
I'm hoping and hoping that through
experience because they are a brand new
brand they will improve on the formula
plenty of time to improve plenty of time
to improve another high-end product this
is the Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana lipstick and this
is in the shade 5007 man Doria okay
maybe this is the problem I got this
because of what's been make up my makeup
news show in the deals section they said
at costco.com you could get Dolce &amp;amp;
Gabbana lipsticks for like 17 bucks and
I was like I'm never going to buy a
dolce gabbana lipstick at full price
stuff never goes on sale I'm getting one
so I hopped on and I got one and let me
tell you right away this is not a bad
lip stick it is not bad but it is not
good and for Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana I expected
my lips to magically transform into
something amazing and it just was so
ordinary and the smell is really bad it
just smells like cheap lipstick and and
it's Dolce and flipping the bond I mean
come on man like what are you kidding me
like no I'm not happy about this not
happy at all color is beautiful it's a
gorgeous lipstick and it's not like the
moisturizes lasting power is typical but
it smells bad and it just isn't amazing
it's got this cute little print on it
but that is not worth $17 let alone 30
some dollars at full price number seven
is a product that has been sitting on my
dresser forever and this is a product
that I'm starting to learn to love but I
really ooh this is dandelion shy
my benefit isn't the packaging
absolutely gorgeous it is so stinkin
beautiful I mean just so much detail got
a little brush in here and what you do
is you dab this on to wherever you want
to highlight I put it on the tops of my
cheekbones and iPad it in with my
fingers that is the way that they do it
in the tutorial on benefits youtube
channels that's what i do i pad it on
and it is nice for a highlight and it is
a matte highlight and it really looks
gorgeous on the skin that's why it is
not lower down it's not that i dislike
this product I just I feel like for the
price point it's just not amazing but
it's really fun to play with I if I this
was a ten dollar product I would be in
love with it but the price point it's
just a little too much for for what it
is so gorgeous packaging though I think
that's what we're paying for here is the
gorgeous packaging I very very rarely
include lifestyle favorites in my top 10
but I think this is very important
because this is something that has
pretty much transformed my whole
sleeping experience and I really wanted
to share with you because it may be able
to help you as well and it's these
headphones these are sleeping headphones
by brand called cozy phones and the ones
that are making this lower are a brand
called sleep phones they're a little bit
more expensive than these then you put
this on your little head and it's got
little speakers that are right here and
you can reposition them within the band
and then it plays your music through
these speakers there round speakers here
and I'm telling you I listened to ASMR
when I sleep if you don't know ASMR it's
crazy it's insane it's creepy but I love
it and I'm addicted to it so that's what
I listened to my husband cannot stand it
it creeps him out you either love ASMR
or you hate it I put this on my head I
put on my ASMR and it like puts me right
to sleep because before I was putting
here at headphones like right into my
ears and hurt my ears so I was really
really happy to find these now the sleep
phones versions I've gone through two of
those in the past six months something
is going on with the cord where the cord
shorts out and and you have to jiggle
the cord in order for the sound to come
out that's happened with two sets of
sleep phones now the
brand new these are cozy phones so I
don't know how long these are going to
last but these the band stretches more
than the sleep phones where the sleep
phones is pretty much one size and it
either falls off your head or it's too
tight and I don't like that brand but I
do really like this one so far so I did
want to mention these because they have
really been a game changer for me for
sleep so if you like white noise or if
you like listening to music when you go
to sleep it's a really nice way to kind
of lose yourself in it I like it better
than just having a speaker on because
it's really in your head because it's on
the headphones you know what I mean I've
been really really loving these and I
wanted to mention those to you all right
right smack dab in the middle we've got
the radiant CC cream microcapsule
technology broad-spectrum SPF 45 PA plus
plus plus plus nut puffs plus by brand
called plea or clay it stands for
creative last aesthetic I found out
recently that this brand is owned by
shiseido so I wanted to mention it
because you may see more of this brand
coming soon if you don't know I just
found this out as well that NARS is
owned by shiseido and so is bare
minerals and bare essentials isn't that
crazy but anyway this product here is
super fabulous it is a ccc cream it
gives a really nice light to medium
coverage you can build it up to a good
solid medium coverage and it is so
smooth to go on lasting power is so good
I got it with my FC points and I am so
stinking thankful that I did because
this has become one of my absolute
favorite favorite favorite face products
of all time really been loving it I've
been loving all this other stuff too
though all the rest of them I've really
really really been loving but oh oh my
gosh so good so good so if you ever run
across this I definitely recommend
trying it all right next up we have the
bombs away I makeup break up by the bomb
and what this is is it's a container
like this you can see how much I've
loved it it's a container like this of
oils and what you do is you put them on
your eyes you rub very gently on your
eyes and your eyes look like you've been
punched in both eyes like repeatedly
because in the eye makeup is just
everywhere you take a tissue you gently
I can just Pat my eyes and the makeup
will come off onto the tissue and it's
super wonderful it's really really nice
now I put this head-to-head with some
coconut oil because coconut oil is
extremely so much less expensive and it
pretty much did the same thing I do like
the texture and consistency of this
better than coconut oil but essentially
it'll do pretty much the same thing
coconut oil was much clearer it was much
slimy or with this it does have an oily
kind of feeling to it but it's not as
much as the coconut oil I may have to
repurchase this at some point because I
did really really like it a lot next up
is a makeup brush that has been
absolutely essential this month like
I've been so addicted to this brush like
I have to use it like when I can't find
it I panic and I never feel like that
about makeup brushes where I panic if I
cannot find it this is the fan brush by
Eve pearl the number is 110 you don't
need this fan brush don't get me wrong
this is not the end-all be-all fan
brushes it's just the shape of it and
the way that it bends and it's just such
a fabulous fabulous brush for contouring
for highlighting for putting what I
don't really use it for putting on blush
I don't really like it for blush nothing
in the bag except mi try to use it for
blush I always abandon it and get
something else but for contouring
girlfriend or boyfriend oh my gosh it is
just perfect and it's so soft and
wonderful if you've never used a fan
brush for contouring and highlighting I
definitely recommend picking one up you
don't want one that's too fat but you
don't want one that's too thin like the
elf one is way too thin do not get that
one that one's good for like brushing
away glitter or fallout on your face but
I wouldn't use the elf one for
contouring and highlighting its way too
thin this one is absolutely perfect and
I am in love with it all right we're
getting to the stuff that just like it
just makes me happy in my heart when I
look at it I mean all of these things
they just really make me happy the CC
cream the fan brush and this oh my gosh
just makes me so happy this is mineral
fusions another hautelook purchase
mineral fusion minerals on a mission
this is the radiance illuminating powder
let me show you what it looks like it's
got these four different shades here and
oh my gosh just so stinkin beautiful the
highlight that these give if you like
pop and highlights if you like that glow
you won't love that shea sell these at
Whole Foods this brand but I got mine
off a whole look and I'm so so so
thankful it's an amazing product I've
used all four shades in here I love them
all I probably like the white the least
but they're all really wonderful
sometimes I'll brush them back and forth
and use more than one I'll use like
these two together are these two
together these two together just it's my
perfect highlight it really is i mean
have a few highlights that are kind of
my perfect highlight but this one even
the pink one man just and this one oh
and it's like blush and highlight
together so it's like cuts the steps you
know i can take one of my blush brush
and put this in and I got blush at
highlight all in one and it saves a step
so if you like those savings step
products this is a good one a number one
this month set it a little I'm banging
on my product it's my alice through the
looking glass palette oh my goodness i
had no idea how much i was going to love
this I had no idea and I love it I truly
truly truly love it this palette is so
fun to play with so fun to play with I'm
finding myself gravitating toward the
middle toward these three these are a
little bit on the weaker side and these
are a little bit on the heavy side and
these three here are like gold they're
like gold they're fabulous having a lot
of fun with Lily it's a little white
with a pink shift to it and it's just so
fun Dutchess is fabulous I mean like
heads will roll I mean really really
like that's real and that's the way it
goes on the eyes like that like it's
crazy but this is the thing and this is
something I've been thinking about I've
know where white this so this is the
thing hey when you see a palette like
this you may look at it and think
there's no way I would wear these shades
but I have been able to because this is
such a high quality palette I have been
able to work with these shades and make
them look wearable I do have a whole
video with a tutorial using this row
right here that i will link down below
like this is totally you can totally
work with this and make it wearable I
know it doesn't seem like it but it's
definitely possible and it's so much fun
like if this is this is a straight-up
toy I said in the video this is a toy
and this is my favorite toy then i
bought this month and I'm I just I love
it I love it it's really really really
fun to play with and I'm just so happy
with it so yes so that's it for my
