I
hello my friends welcome to my review of
the Maybelline the blush nudes palette
now there are three different versions
of this kind of palette that Maybelline
has come out with one is just called the
news the other one is like the bright
side of the brights and now they've come
out with the blushed nudes now this one
is being compared to the Urban Decay
Naked 3 which i do not own but what I
can tell you is whether I feel like
these are the same quality shadows as I
have in my Urban Decay palettes my Too
Faced pilots my steel of pallets things
like that so we're gonna go ahead and
give in to the review but I did want to
let you know that a few days ago did a
review of the hard candy three pallets I
will link these down below these are
amazing palettes I've swatches through
these and i will link that video below
in case you did not see that because i
feel like that is definitely worth
watching as well but let's go ahead and
get into this palette the blush nudes
palette does come with 12 shadows the
palette does not have a magnetic closure
it has a snap closure but it is a
beautiful shimmery blushed kind of color
like a light pink color it is made out
of plastic you do get to sponge
applicators in here they have one has a
kind of a more round end and then a more
pointy end and you do get two of those
and as far as shade ranges it looks like
there's only one mat in here the rest
are more satiny almost a couple of more
on the edge of shimmery kinds of colors
there is one here that is has some
sparkle in it it's kind of a deep like I
almost like oh I guess it's a black it's
hard to see I believe it's a black with
a lot of pink sparkle in it bright pink
almost this color let me go ahead and
swatch these for you so you can see how
they look I'm just gonna do some finger
swatches I can tell you this one here is
a little bit powdery as far as when I
rub my finger in it so that one's a
little disappointing but the rest are
very creepy all right here we go
hey and this is with no primer let's do
this one again this one didn't come out
so hot it's right on my wrist bone there
we go okay so that is the first row I
can tell you this one is a little bit
chunky little powdery and the rest are
very creamy so just those two powdery
ones okay this is all 12 shades so you
can see the shimmer and some of them see
more some have more shimmer than others
see the opacity like trying to hide my
eyeballs so that it focuses on my arm
not my eyes so I know I look a little
creepy like looking behind here I want
you to be able to get a good view of it
I don't want my eyes to mess it up okay
so overall first impression of these you
know I just got these today so I haven't
had time to play with them I am going to
do a full review after I've played with
them of all of the drugstore pout that I
just bought I also got these two from
l'oreal the lapel at nude one lapel a
new to this video is coming up next and
then a couple weeks I'm gonna do like
kind of a dupe video and swatch it and
that's watches but I'm going to compare
all of these show other high-end dupes
things like that in a video to come but
this is really just the first
impressions video so first impressions
these are very very creamy there were
only two shades that I found to be
powdering this one and this one so for
ten dollars i think this is definitely a
win i feel like you can get a lot of
versatile looks from this i do feel like
what this is lacking are some more
deeper shades for deeper skin tones i
feel like this is going to be best for
your medium to lighter skin tones maybe
even starting to get a little deep but
those deeper skin tones i'm not sure how
much you're going to be able to work
with this just because a lot of the
shades tend to go lighter shades that
i'm most excited about I kind of wrote
from my favorites i kind of like to lean
toward the satin ones so these are those
three right
there are kind of my favorites that I'm
leaning toward right now and I really
like and then let me see if I have a
good place to squash this I'm gonna
swatch this from on the inside on my arm
just to show you i mean just I don't
know you can't even like it's like
playing twister over here try and get
you to see them but I just very excited
about those shades I feel like that the
shadows overall extremely creamy I am
curious to play with them and see how
they actually perform on the eye but
based on the swatches the way they feel
how they compare to my high-end palettes
I expect them to perform well so this is
a recommend for me at this point again
I'm going to keep you updated on how
they perform the I show you some looks
keep up with my Instagram and my twitter
I'll be posting pictures there have
looks that I create every day from the
new palettes that I've just purchased
