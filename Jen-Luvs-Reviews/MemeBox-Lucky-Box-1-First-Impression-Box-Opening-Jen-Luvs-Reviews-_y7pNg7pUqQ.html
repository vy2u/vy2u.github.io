first Mimi box opening I am so excited
about this there's been many of you that
have commented on my subscription box
openings that you would love to see me
do a mani box opening and I like a day
after I got a request I got an email
from Mimi box saying we would love to
send you a Mimi box to review and I was
like yes so so excited to show you this
this is a subscription service from
Korea and it's all Korean products so
really excited to get this I'm not
showing you the front cuz it's got my
mailing information here so I'm just
gonna cover that but that's the way it
comes with all the mailing stickers all
the international shipping it does say
it's from Seoul it's completely sealed
I'm gonna go ahead and cut it open ah I
have no idea what to what to expect from
this so comes like this all bubble wraps
sorry the Lighting's going back and
forth I need to figure out how to shut
that off if you have a Canon t3i you
know how to shut off the the light and
going back and forth the light Ottawa
just let me know because I would love to
turn that off if I can so this is the
box it's super cute it's got the little
present here and then there's this
silver reflective stuff here and it's
just really kidding it just says get it
beauty box buy me me box this is
something called the lucky box this one
says you told us what you loved and we
fought to bring them back
feeling lucky we've included the best
products from Mimi box one through mini
boxes six number six to two so two to
six don't miss out on any of the other
amazing many opportunities to come so I
says the products in there I don't want
to look and see any more of that because
I'm seeing this box full of stuff I'm
not quite sure how much this costs but I
will put the information down below and
I'm putting annotation wherever maybe
over here how much this actually cost so
very excited and the the first thing I'm
seeing is this little tiny tube and
everything is in Korean so I'm not quite
sure but it looks like a little lip
gloss swatches from my Ipsy opening that
I just
did if you haven't seen that I'll put a
link down below just filmed it a moment
to go off if see swatches smells like
cherries cherries fruit oh it's like a
stain it feels very wet and it's bright
bright bright red and I can see it's
already stained because when I try to
blend it you can see the tough stain
underneath of where it's been stubborn
so very excited to try this it is the
colors very bright for me I'm more of a
nudie kind of lip person but this will
take me out of my comfort zone and I'm
sure it is going to be awesome so really
excited about that okay next is new
Ganic customize pour control essence
reduces the appearance of dilated pores
now I personally don't have dilated
pores so I'm actually going to give this
away to one of you so that somebody that
needs this more than I do so if you do
have dilated pores go ahead and put a
comment down below that you would like
the pore control product and I will pick
a winner within the first 24 hours that
this video goes live please make sure
you check and see whether it's been 24
hours because sometimes like a month
later I have people trying to enter the
giveaway and I feel really bad well then
you know a couple of days after this
video goes live check your YouTube mail
and see if you've won so if you're
interested in that put that comment and
then this could be yours okay the next
thing I see is dreams come true bounce
cheese cream what is cheese cream like
cream cheese bounce cheese bounce cheese
is in the beginning and then cream is
after that after that the dream of cream
is now realized it will extend bounce
away on your face such like mozzarella
cheese and give elasticity without
dryness all day long I don't know I do
you putting cheese on my face what is
that what is that I don't know it's just
too funny okay so this is how it looks
it almost looks like a philosophy
product in the packaging I sit like
cheese whenever it sounds like cheese oh
it doesn't look like cheese
doesn't smell like cheese so that's good
it must not be chief it's a little goopy
it will extend bounce away on your face
like mozzarella cheese it is stringy
look it's stringy like cheese like
string cheese that is so weird look at
that I just want to play with it Wow
Luiz let me do that this is funny I just
have fun to play Wow okay I'm gonna see
how it feels on my skin I gotta stop
playing with it it's once it goes on you
only need a tiny bit cuz I'm like trying
to spread it out feels very wet neat I
will totally try this this is fun this
is very unique that's one thing of I
love about this you know when you get
things from from other countries yeah
it's totally different I mean their
their different perspectives on skin
care different people with different
opinions of what they want and what they
need so I don't think you'd ever find a
product like this in the US so I'm
really excited about this it's so funny
next up I see this glory vegan nail
lacquer and it's in a very dark red ok
now this is very interesting it is in
the color butene buku buku me buchumi
we're gonna go ahead and zoom in do the
trip test ok so I'm gonna call this on a
2 to 3 coat polish this does look like a
really pretty color unfortunately I have
probably one two three let me show you
how many polishes I have they're similar
so these are how many dark red nail
polishes I have I mean this is this is
probably the color that I have the most
of this is the new one and then this is
one by covergirl that I've had forever
and this one's called cherry brandy and
this one's by spy ritual and this one is
called down-to-earth here's this one by
Revlon and this one is really old this
is called blackberry oh it's really old
I should probably throw that one away
this one is by wet and wild and it is
called haze of love and then this one is
another spy ritual this one's probably
quite different but this one is called
flower child oh I have so many polishes
that are so similar to this I'm gonna
give this one away as well now this
one's gonna have to be ground ship so
this one's gonna take extra extra extra
long to get to you but
put this as a giveaway to if you're
interested in the glory nail polish put
that into your comment as well okay
let's see what else we got okay we got
iope bio essence intensive conditioning
special gift
what are you it sounds something
intensive conditioning it looks like
some cotton pads and some kind of bottle
here transparent and smooth skin through
the skin conditioning I don't think that
came out the way that they wanted it to
so that doesn't really make sense but
there's some drink okay yes they are
there are some in English it's just
history though there's no direct or
they're good directions okay so after
reading the directions basically what
you do is you take these pads you put
them on your fingers like you kind of
like put your hand in it and then you
take these little drop of guys and you
wet it and then you rub it all over your
face so very interesting and it's just
supposed to I don't know what is it
supposed to do and you read that again
it's the perfect balance between nature
science and humans I'm not quite sure
exactly what that means nature science
and humans it's supposed to enhance
every day changing skin's condition to
deliver vitality to the skin it's
supposed to enhance the skin's condition
whatever exactly that means I'm not
quite sure but that's okay I'm always up
for enhancing my skin's condition next
we have this gel mist
too-cool-for-school that's neat
what do you do gel mist what do you do
it's all in Korean
it does have some directions and
different things on this little card so
let me see if I can find it soothing
hydration healthy looking glow to the
skin use in addition to daily
moisturizer whenever skin feels thirsty
so this will be nice for I don't know I
guess it's just like a just a spray just
spray on your face whenever you feel
like you need a little extra something
thumb spray it on that's cool 28 remedy
acne acne pore deep cleanser those of
you who watched my video you know that I
don't really get acne I used to when I
was younger but I don't anymore but I'm
gonna pass this on to a friend of mine I
think that she would enjoy this and that
looks like it's a full-size cool and
then the last thing in here is a face
lifting mask and I have a friend that
enjoys these as well and I always
he's onto her and she loves the Korean
masks she said that they are the
absolute best so very excited to pass
that on to her and it's an anti-wrinkle
whitening firming moisturizing ooh I
don't know about the whitening part oh
I'll let Mary Lynn know and we'll see
whether she wants it or not if not I
will pass it on to someone else so so in
summary we got the gel mist for
moisturization
we got the eye of a bio essence
intensive conditioning like smoothie
stuff that you put on a cotton pad and
put all of your face and then we got the
new Ganic customized pore control
essence we've got the twenty-eighth
