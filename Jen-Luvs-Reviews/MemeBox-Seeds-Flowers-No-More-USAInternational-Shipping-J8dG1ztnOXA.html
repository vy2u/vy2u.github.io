hello my friends welcome to my very last
Korean Mimi box unboxing I'm not really
sure exactly what's happening with Mimi
box but I got an email from them and
they said something like that they've
lost their some of their business
relations with people in Korea I guess
the company they were working with to
get korean beauty products so their box
is changing quite a bit and i'm not
quite sure i don't really understand the
changes much but they did say hey we're
asking a select few people to review our
last Korean Mimi boxes so I couldn't
resist and I wanted to get one baby box
is a Korean beauty service it's not a
subscription service because it doesn't
really you go on and you buy whatever
boxes that you're interested in they
range anywhere from about twenty dollars
they can be up to forty forty five
dollars but again it's whatever you want
so this one is called the seeds and
flowers box and it came with six
full-size products and I'll show you
what we got the first one is a lavender
collagen mask and this is it's supposed
to help with aging dullness rough
textures irritation and dryness and when
used regularly this in flavin der
infused mask will deliver deep nutrition
and replenishment too tired sensitive
skin and help maintain healthy glowing
complexion and this is a sheet mask and
I personally do not use these I pass
these on to my friend Mary Lynn who
loves these and she will be getting
these I know a lot of people love sheet
masks I can't get past the wet sticky
yuckiness of it so this is probably my
least favorite thing in the box but
that's just a personal preference thing
I know a lot of people love these so
that's one product the next product is
this Bulgarian Rose moisture and
nutrition facial facial cream I'm not
going to open this yet because I have a
lot of face creams open and this is a
big big product so I want to wait to
open it so I don't compromise you know
the integrity of the product by opening
it now when I'm not ready to use it so
it's supposed to moisturize and brighten
the complexion Bulgarian rose is a
natural source of vitamin C and helps
repair the look of fine lines and stent
skin and discolorations I'm not the
biggest fan of rose
sent but I will use it on occasion and
I'm sure this will be used and loved and
I'm excited have it in it's ginormous
next up is this this is the rosehip oil
foaming cleanser and I'm for some reason
I go through cleansers faster than any
other thing that I get samples of so I'm
always happy to get cleansers and one
thing about Nene box that's very
important if you do ever get something
from Mimi box that has products from
Korea which I don't know if you will be
able to anymore but it's very very
important to keep the card because
everything is in Korean all over this
one and a lot of them so you have to
keep the card to know what in the world
you're supposed to do with things but
this one here is the let's see the
rosehip foaming cleanser it's a
non-drying formula that burst into a
rich lather when activated with water to
deep clean your pores instantly refresh
skin and give you a naturally luminous
glow so yes very excited about this this
will be next in line because I'm out of
full-size face cleansers all I have a
sample so this will be next in line once
I finish a bunch of my samples so very
happy to have that this here is the yada
yeah pure green emotion and this is a
product that confuses me a bit because
I'm not really sure what emulsion is it
does say daily moisturizer on the bottom
so that now i know it emulsion is it
means daily moisturizer yeah okay now i
understand it says that focus on focuses
on hydration to soothe and soften the
skin with the minimized chemicals to
create naturally pure and healthy skin
so that's very exciting to open it new i
can't open it maybe i can pop a little
this one off to worry about as much air
getting in not as much anyway yeah it
just smells floral smells very light
light floral scents very nice he's got
chamomile and rosemary to enrich this
quick acting formula to soothe and calm
the skin grail jelly forms a protective
hydration coat over skin service to lock
in moisture and nutrients into the skin
so very happy to have that and this is
called a pure green emulsion sweet all
right to
products in here this is the high
protection Moringa like sunblock and
this will be nice going into the summer
months that are going to be coming up
before we know and I know it's freezing
outside we record lows right now below 0
here in Maryland so yeah I'm not really
thinking about sun block right now not
so you don't need some luck in the
winter but I'm not really outside much
because it's freezing but once it goes
into summer spring and summer I will
definitely be in need of this and this
is a fast absorbing ultra lightweight
fluid that provides daily protection
against broad-spectrum uva UVB damage it
just goes into a little bit Moringa oil
in the history of that it's a sheer
formula has a silky texture and a
weightless feel so you're supposed to be
use it even with other skin care
products or under makeup is fine for a
soft matte finish which I like a matte
finish I'm gonna open this because this
is going to end up being used very soon
I'm not gonna I just want to smell it it
smells a little bit citrusy actually see
what it feels like feels nice seeps in
very very quickly ooh it feels smooth
it's got a smoothness to it maybe that's
the Moringa oil Oh excited about that
very nice does it have no it doesn't
have any greens I always like to look
and see where Moringa oil follow falls
on the ingredients cuz sometimes it's
like way down at the bottom there's like
none of it in there but of course it's
on Korean so I have no idea but I do
know that it feels good and I know that
this is going to use I'm very excited
about that I think I'm most excited
about this even though I have to wait on
it and then the very last thing in here
is this and this is the a choice a
choice perfume body mist in dear iris
and Lila's best friend's name is iris I
show the store she got very excited and
it just smells it's just a mess and it
smells like irises it's got a beautiful
floral scent uh it's very sweet though
it's got like a sweet floral and that's
my favorite is sweet floral so super
happy about this provides hydration
antioxidant benefits that's cool citrusy
top note floral mill note and a sensuous
bass note to lift the spirits not
overpowering or overwhelming and I would
totally agree with that it's a subtle
fragrance to hydrate
again I'm going to spray a little bit is
the smell it smells like alcohol at
first very much like alcohol at first
dry it up a little bit and see probably
crushing the notes yeah it's just very
light it's gonna be a really nice after
shower little spritz spritz you know so
give the skin a really nice scent and
very nice alright so I just went on the
Mimi box website to try to see how much
this was and it's no longer there which
is like why even bother to send these
out if nobody is going to be able to buy
them anymore like is it just to let
everybody know that meanie box is no
longer doing Korean boxes it all it says
is a bunch of USA boxes and then there's
a bunch of individual products that you
can buy there but I don't know what
they're thinking but I so I don't know
how much this was I think it was like
$32 something like that so let's just go
through Jones personal value if i can
find out how much this box costs I will
put it down in the description just so
you all know so this is the rosehip
foaming cleanser I would pay for a
cleanser this size ten dollars ten
dollars for that for a Clint this is an
oyster Iser another ten probably knows I
mean it's hard to say this is royal
jelly in it so we'll say 15 for that
because of the royal jelly for something
like this i would pay seven dollars for
this kind of spray for the mask i
wouldn't pay anything because this isn't
my personal preference if i was buying
it from mary lynn i'd probably pay a
dollar or two for it for the Bulgarian
Rose moisture a nutrition facial premium
I probably wouldn't spend as much on
this just because I'm not as big a fan
of the Rose scent and it kind of looks
like something you get it like big lots
or something like that so we'll say five
bucks on this one and then for the SPF i
would say another eight for the SPF this
just looks really nice and I don't know
it's a smaller size but it does look
really nice and it smells nice it feels
good so we'll say eight on that so just
personal value is definitely above I'm
sure what this point with this box cost
and I am very thankful to have it and
I'm sad to see that Mimi box is changing
their format but they got to do what
they gotta do so I do thank them so much
for sending me this and give me the
opportunity to get one of these and
definitely check out the main box
website to see what they're up to and
the boxes they do have available they do
sauipe boxes available they're just a
little bit different I don't think
they're gonna have quite as many brands
but i don't know i don't know we'll see
what happens so thank you so much for
