Mimi box opening I'm excited to bring
this to you to show you what I got in
mini box number ten now unfortunately me
back to the pretend is not available but
muni box 11 and 12 and 13 and a bunch of
other ones I just saw a chocolate one
just came out cacao whatever base
there's a milk one there's a face mask
one there's a ton of them available
right now these boxes ship from Korea
they're all Korean beauty products which
is really fun to get it's not a
subscription box in that you get a new
box every month you just go on an order
the boxes that you want the regular Mimi
boxes are 23 dollars for a box and then
you pay seven dollars shipping at least
inside the u.s. you'll have to check
their website for other other countries
for shipping I'm pretty sure it's the
same though before I show you this I do
want to show you a couple of products
they sent me for review and I'm going to
also show you the application of those
products right now which I'm excited
about so the first thing that we got was
this power lift found pack all of these
products are from a company called drew
dr w w and then a little dot there and
this is a really nice foundation i was
really excited about it i open it up and
it's this really neat packaging very
hard plastic this is in number 21 is the
shade that they sent me which was
perfect for my skin i'm wearing it right
now comes with a sponge inside and then
that is how it looks of course it was
clean when i first got it and i'm going
to show you right now how you get the
product out you press down on the
plastic and then the product kind of
squirts out of the little holes then you
use the sponge to apply it to your face
and i did find that the application of
the sponge to the face really was the
best way to apply this now i did try it
with my Beauty Blender I did try it with
a makeup brush and I honestly preferred
the sponge that they provided and I
really like the application of it I felt
like it went on very nicely very
smoothly did not crease on my skin was
also a very long wearing foundation
which really surprised me I thought the
coverage was also really nice it was a
medium to full coverage foundation a
skin match was perfect for me and I
really really like this foundation I was
surprised now you do
to set this with a powder or else your
face will be super uber shiny I wouldn't
say luminous i would say shiny they also
sent me this power lift celeb medalist
limited edition finger melting method
which is very interesting I open it up
what in the war am I supposed to do with
these things and then they sent me
directions on how to use each one and
thankfully they did because all of them
are in Korean now let me show you real
quick what each one is and then I'll
show you the application of the
concealer specifically and also one of
the lip products so the first one up
here is the power potion lip balm there
you can see there's a little bit of
color there that is from application of
a different product that's in here but
this is just a clear bomb and it smells
like roses if you enjoy the scent of
roses on your lips you will like this if
you don't you will not like this it is a
moisturizing lip balm it didn't dry out
my lips away that some petrol base lip
products seem to but this I did really
enjoy using this except for it I felt
like the Rose scent was too strong for
me I did not enjoy the strength of it
the next one was the end lip burgundy is
what it's called and that's actually
what i'm wearing on my lips today and
i'll show you the application of that
now it is a very deep deep burgundy
color it goes on very very pigmented it
does not go on glossy it all goes on
very matte so i did apply a gloss over
top and really enjoy the way that it
looks it is a bit bold for my personal
preference but i do enjoy it like on the
weekends I wouldn't wear this to work
because it's just too much I think for
my work situation as a fourth grade
teacher so but I do enjoy wearing this
on date night things like that next
product that they included in here is
the blush and this is the celebrity gel
and coral pink I believe you can also
use this on your lips as well I did not
find this to be very pigmented it was a
little difficult to use you can see me
applying it here with my fingertips and
you can see how it just it just isn't
pigmented it doesn't have a big punch to
it that you like cream blush formula
that you cannot go over port with this
would be a good option for you but you
know I don't know it just didn't feel
like it was enough punch for me
personally I did try it also with the
elf stippling brush and it did not seem
to help a whole lot with the application
feel like it came off with just
very very light light light next up I
have the go bang primer in peach and
this I also did not enjoy it's very very
soft feels good to go on but I did not
like the way that it made the texture of
my skin under my foundation didn't I
feel like it made I use it with their
foundation and I did not like the way
that it looked under their foundation I
felt it made the foundation break down
more also I noticed some little tiny bit
of bumps developing on my skin after I
use this I mean just very very just the
texture of my skin just wasn't right
after I use it so I only used it the one
time I was scared to use it again maybe
it's just my particular skin type but
this I was did not like at all the last
thing is the concealer and this
concealer is amazing absolutely love it
it is super full coverage I didn't have
any haven't had any blemishes lately so
I don't know how it would cover
blemishes but it man does it cover up
any darkness or redness on my face it
gives me that nice light lightens under
I that I really enjoy I don't know how
many shades this comes in I also don't
know how many shades the foundation
comes in i'm pretty sure it's only
lighter skin tones so sorry for the
ladies that are darker skin tones but i
believe these are these are marketed to
a korean women who do have lighter skin
so if you have a darker skin i don't
think that you would want to order any
of these products but you can check with
the company on their website and see if
they do offer it in darker skin tones
but i don't think that they do but
anyway this is the hidden card concealer
and I just really really love this did
not find any creasing throughout the day
very moisturizing just a really really
nice concealer you can see it going on
here and how smoothly it goes on I was
rubbing a bit but I feel like it when I
patted it it was just too much like I
really needed to rub it a little bit say
it not make it be so full coverage it
was just too much if I just patted it it
just looked weird so I did rub it a bit
to get it to blend appropriately in my
opinion into my skin so those are the
products that come in the power lift
celeb medalist limited edition finger
melding method little kit here overall
really enjoyed this as well the last
thing that they sent me was this
powerless strong cream with omega it's
instant
lift and radiance treatment and it is
just a face cream I believe a day cream
and it came packed to the top I mean
like if it had been any more it would
have been overflowing out I use this for
about a week I did not see anything
magical going on with my skin when I
used it but that doesn't mean nothing
magical was happening maybe it has some
you know internal Omega skin benefits
that I just could not see I did enjoy it
it does seem very nicely into the skin I
did feel like my skin was moisturize
felt really nice the only thing again
this has extremely strong rose smell
very strong so if you do not let strong
sense you will not like this but if you
do enjoy a strong Rose scent then this
might be one for you that was my biggest
one that I did not like about it it's
just the scent was just so incredibly
strong but the product itself inside I
really did enjoy even though nothing
magical really seemed to happen with my
skin but I do want to show you what's in
the actual media box number 10 i have
not opened this i do not know what is
inside so I'm very excited to share it
with you maybe box number 10 it is the
global box i'm assuming it's the same
price no matter where you live to hear
the products / and whoa holy moly you
look inside and look these giant
products your huge for thirty dollars
that looks like one two three four five
full-size products in here six bucks a
product as you're watching you can think
about whether these products will be
worth six dollars to you it looks like
there's six things in here according to
the cart all right amazing and I'll tell
you at all as i go through i'll tell you
the retail value of each product so the
first thing on a plot is this giant box
this is a multi action smart cream gel
cream essence in one I've learned my
lesson not to neglect the card because
the card really gives me a lot of
information since most of the stuff the
directions and things are in Korean so
let's see what this is by Drew and it is
a smart cream containing mineral-rich
water from coral reefs portulaca I don't
know that word weird and green tea
extracts this multifunctional cream will
deeply soothe and nourish tired damaged
skin
basically a moisturizing cream with
whitening and anti-aging essence
whitening at summer time I don't want my
skin why did but hopefully I mean it
might just even out the skin tone so
combines either bring back healthy
translucent glow to your skin a lot of
these whitening things just kind of even
out your skin tone so if I get a lot of
freckles in the summertime this may
actually be kind of nice to even out my
skin tone a bitch so i will i will try
this and i will keep you updated on that
next up i see an auto palm moisturizing
i prepare serum i might as well just
show you now I've got one of those for
you guys too they set me an extra one of
these for giveaway and i'll explain what
the giveaway is in a second after i tell
you what this is unique paraben-free

of aging provide antioxidant protection
and ultra moisturization and leaves the
skin looking brighter especially
beneficial for dry and sensitive skin

that is what that is i will be giving
one of those away to you all
specifically because they send it to me

24 hours after the video has gone live
so check and see the time this was gon
lie I go in the comment and I cut it off

portion of this video is now over and
then within a few hours i'll pick my

the video and every way possible try to
notify the winner of this especially if
you have dry or sensitive skin this may
be a product that you may be interested
in using let me open up the package and
show you mine and what it looks like
there you go and it is a point five
fluid ounce and let's play a little bit
comes out like a little bit of a cream
and it is very cool to feel on my skin
has a tiny bit of a sweet scent to it
but it's very very mild does definitely
i'm glad not to have that strong Rose
scent and then you just close it like my
uh mothership going down Wow I'm excited
to try this hopefully you're excited
about it too if I had you know 50 of
them
get 50 away but I only have one so put a
comment down below that you're
interested in the moisturizing I repair
serum if you are and Daniel the answer
that's all you got to do I don't even
require you to subscribe to my videos if
you're watching this video I appreciate
you you can be entered to win alright
next I have the curling essence two
times by missin seen this has no
directions in English so let's check
this out enhance with argan oil cedar
wood oil this two-in-one hair essence
provides deep nutrition and helps to
find your curls all at once I don't have
curls it will instantly make your
sagging curls bounce with luster and
elasticity I don't think that this would
necessarily have to be for curly hair I
just sounds really nice so an anxious to
try that let's smell it and see if it
has a strong smell has a a soapy set
like a clean soapy a little bit of a
fruity kind of set not very strong cool
cool all right and then next we had a
poor moo pool deep cleansing oil free
and water soluble so I'm assuming this
as a primer no no no there's no need for
a double cleansing routine anymore with
our moon pool deep cleansing this oil
free gentle to skin cleanser just by
melting even the most waterproof makeup
nice weather the eyeliner foundation or
lipstick plus it's damaging to your skin
to use multiple cleansing products one
after another so basically use this
because everybody else is terrible
because they make you use lots of
products we're just going to make you
use one so you massage the cleanser by
rolling with your hands until becomes
too stiff to roll anymore and then you
wash it off with warm water weird I've
got to try this this is weird guy comes
out like an oil did you did you did you
do just feels like an oil I don't feel
anything being stiff too stiff to roll
anymore I don't feel anything rolling at
all I'm a little confused it just seems
to be seeping into my skin there's no
scent to it no set maybe a tiny bit of a
nutty sense but no I don't know what
it's talking about that's weird okay I
get it I think
they're trying to say is like right now
I can't I can't move it around anymore
because it's dried so once it dries onto
your skin that's when you wash it off
I've never tried anything like that
before that's really neat two more
products in here this is they always
send a face mask ginseng nutritious
black sheep mask who I gotta get Marilyn
to take a picture of herself wearing
this if you watch my videos you know I
always get my face messed my friend Mary
Lynn and she got the one if you saw my
last movie box video there was one that
was like a giant sigh face and I put it
on her desk at work to like creep around
and totally freaked her out i wish i had
a video of it so look at these images
such random images ok so we've got to
care it with a hat and a flower coming
out of it we've got an eye dropper we've
got some kind of juicy fruit here we've
got some maybe some bell looking flowers
I don't know that looks it's an island
Jeju Island you've got some Tomatoes
maybe some kind of science looking
beaker this little guy here I don't know
what his deal is he's like a thumbs up
use my mask and then something that says
dt a little package says dt Oh Julie
tree is the name of the brand oh and
some logs so it's seemingly very random
images there but just makes it all the
more fun Cole ok so that would be going
to Marilyn and she can let me know how
it is and then the last thing is this is
by hand skin and I don't know what it is
it's bio origin royal ampoule ampoule BB
maybe a BB cream I'd be cool you know
Korean BB creams are very very famous in
the United States for being amazing and
let's see aha Hanson's famous royal and
pool BB cream is packed with a rich
nutrition from royal jelly Astra
extracts and it slightly glides over
your skin when applied leaving visibly
silk your bright and complexion me
anxious to try this it is teeny tiny but
that's ok ok just see kind of how that
whoo a little bit grey blends in pretty
nicely though I
cherries to see how that's going to look
all over my face it feels very nice it
feels very silky so really happy about
this and cannot wait to try this all
over the face who I really really like
Mimi box I do get this as a promotional
box but I promise you I'm always honest
without what's in it because it doesn't
help you any if I'm not honest there's
no point in making this video if I'm
going to be dishonest actually of a
video coming up about that very very
soon so in the box for thirty dollars
including shipping we got the mask which
is a one-time use we got the auto the
auto palm moisturizing I Repair Serum we
got the multi-action smart cream gel
this the moisturizer here and then we
got miss a and seen curling essence two
times we got the cleanser here poor mole
pool deep cleansing cleanser and then we
got the BB cream so you well over get
what you pay for with Mimi box that's
insane so Wow ah I you know I know I'm
sent these things to review honestly
like I don't think think anybody could
argue with the fact that that is packed
full of higher quite well known of its
high quality but things that they claim
to be worth of a high value I mean
things are probably the value that you
place on them but I don't think anybody
can argue that that is well over thirty
dollars worth of products in there so if

don't a lot of the questions you may
