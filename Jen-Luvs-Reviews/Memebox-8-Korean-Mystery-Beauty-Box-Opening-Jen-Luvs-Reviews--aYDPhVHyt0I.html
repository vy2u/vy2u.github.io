box hello my friends welcome to another
Mimi box opening I was actually not
expecting another Mamie box they did
contact me and wanted me to do a mimi
box review and i was really excited
about it and i opened it and i really
had fun with it i had fun with the
products i had fun with the video and
then I didn't hear anything from them
and I didn't expect to get another one
and then all of a sudden I maybe buck
shows up and then like a day later I got
an email like hey we sent you Mimi box
number right here's the track number and
it's like okay I guess I'm doing another
meeting box opening so you all seem to
really enjoy it so I'm excited to be
able to bring you another Mimi box and
this is it miele box is not a
subscription service in that you sign up
for it and then they ship it to every
month you pick out which one you want to
purchase and it is a mystery box but
it's not a monthly thing you just go on
and you pick which box you want to get
the prices are different depending on
which one you choose so I'm not quite
sure exactly how much this one was but i
will put all that information in the
description down below in case you're
curious of how much this costs here so
let's just jump right in and see what is
in here now there were a couple of
products that were outside of the box
this one here is looks like cotton pads
organic cotton pads and they look
similar to the shiseido ones so I'm
curious to see what these will be like I
will definitely love trying them they
are organic cotton pads so there I use
these for makeup removal when I use a
liquid makeup remover they're also good
for toner things like that so excited to
try those and then this also was on the
outside it's nice and bubble wrapped up
but I don't know what it is yeah it's
kind of defeating the purpose of the
bone wrap if I like squeeze the products
anyway so here we go varicose ultimate
velvet primer cool I'm excited to try
that vitamin a and e and it's a 6 free
formula neat it's a sebum control pout
control I'm assuming control powder and
you know what you guys probably know
this but I don't I've seen sebum written
like everywhere and I don't know what it
is but I know that it's bad and I know
that it's on your face so I need to like
look that up and see what in the world
that is I'm assuming it's like oils on
your skin so it controls that very cool
a little bit of us set to it but not
offensive a little bit of a lotion II
kind of scent to it so cool I don't like
putting strong sense on my face so I
always smell my products now let's get
into what is actually in the meanie box
and they have the products listed here
and I'm not going to look unless I'm
totally and completely confused I'm not
going to look okay so this here says max
clinic caviar massage oil phone
somebody's getting a massage and I think
it's made I'm going to convince my
husband to use the saw me very soon
that'll be nice this thing is huge sweet
it's got a little pump there yeah it's
got a kind of a medicinal snow but I can
there's like a calming like a lavender
kind of smell smells like spa ish mm-hmm
so not super strong but I think that it
will be nice massage in three steps
clearing moisture and nutrition
interesting cool one thing I brought to
mention i didn't mention this before
this box is from korea so that's really
cool to get all these products from
korean companies because korea is known
for their skincare lines especially and
for their beauty products so I'm really
a very happy to get things from Korea
usually they're marketed to the Korean
consumers so sometimes there's very
interesting things in here so this is
one that I can see definitely using
caviar massage oil foam very cool liking
that okay next I see snow white cream
that's a little scary for me i'm not
trying to get paler be in my Mimi box
last time I got a ton of
tons of comments about Korean culture
and how people want to lighten your skin
I know this but I here in the US it is a
mark of leisure to be tan so there in
the US and the in Korea it's a mark of
the working class to be tan so you know
I don't know about whitening products my
friend Mary Lynn that uses a lot of
these kinds of products she says a lot
of the whitening things really just even
out your skin tone and don't really
whiten your skin so I'm going to take
her word for it and I might try this
it's a whitening cream for bright skin
tone I may try this just to see what
it's like it does come with a little
spatula thingy here and we will see how
that goes I'm a little bit scared but
we'll try it maybe we'll try it like
someplace inconspicuous to see whether
it'll actually lightens my skin and then
if it doesn't lighten it too much then
maybe I'll try it on my face it says
heart face ultra poor care sleeping pack
sleep in pack see what that means I
don't know it's all in Korean that's all
it says in English so I'm gonna have to
look this one up to see what's going on
with that what product goes with that
funny little guy he's not beautiful
uh-huh no he's got some kind of like
purple sore on his forehead I'm trying
to find it in here I don't see that
heart face oh there it is heart face
ultra poor care sleeping pack keeps
you're saying moisturize all night long
additionally it minimizes your pores and
controls sebum production while you're
asleep well that should be fun to try
very nice and then we got a tony moly
okay bc date BCDA shun I don't know SPF
30 and I my son one of my son's teachers
at school is from Korea and she said
whenever you get something from tony
moly like be so thankful because it's an
amazing amazing brand that is very hyped
up in Korea and all over the world so
very excited to try that I'm going to
peek and see what the deal is with this
too BB and CC foundation protecting your
skin from the Sun while giving you full
coverage sweet
it's so excited about that cool oh I'm
excited oh very excited see how the skin
tone is oh it's kind of empty I like
squeezed it all the way through and
nothing is coming out that's sad I
better not squeeze it out i'm not going
to squeeze out because i want to
actually use it and it doesn't seem like
just a whole lot of product in here well
that's a little disappointing because i
was really excited to try this it looks
like it's only going to be maybe one or
two uses because i can't see through the
bottle but it's only seven grams so hmm
but i'll be thankful for what I have and
then this here is a lot of stuff in
Korean hair rich vitae sell hair program
shampoo for in one complete shampoo free
of sulfate silicon and synthetic dyes
made with natural preservatives protect
her from damage while enhancing the
health of both your hair and scalp very
nice happy to try that and then there's
one more little sample I guess they
realized it wasn't very full and added
an extra little sample or maybe to share
with a friend of the tony moly be
sedation cool and then here is the funny
little guy he's a face mask oh look you
like tear out his eyeballs what is that
oh my gosh you like literally tear on
his eyeball should i do it yes okay i'm
taking out his eyeballs and i'm gonna
put it on how do I look do I look
beautiful highly ronic acid which is
supposedly really good I don't use face
masks I pass these on to my friend
Marilyn hi Marilyn you're getting the
funny Korean ad tomorrow at work I'm
gonna be giving this to you and you get
to keep him forever and I can see my
friend Mary Lynn like strapping this to
her face and walking around just wearing
this thing a whole day long she is gonna
crack up very very fun and then you have
these creepy eyeball did you get to keep
for your very own so I'll keep the
eyeballs I'll pass this on to Marilyn
and everybody will be happy alright in
summary we got the ultra poor care
sleeping pack for taking
your skin while you sleep in we got this
hi hair rich vitae sell hair program
shampoo we got the snow white cream
which terrifies me but we will work
through that and I will face my fear we
got the max clinic caviar massage oil
foam this thing is ginormous we got the
very itty-bitty sample of the bees
sedation by tony moly and then they gave
us a little tiny bonus of that and then
we got the varicose ultra matte velvet
primer and this glorious silly fun face
mask this tells me people eat people in
Korea have a sense of humor that's
that's what that tells me which makes me
