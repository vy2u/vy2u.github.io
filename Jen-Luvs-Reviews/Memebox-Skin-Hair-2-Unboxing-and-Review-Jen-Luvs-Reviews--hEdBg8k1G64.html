box opening I've done a lot of Mimi box
opening so if you guys are bored with me
maybe box openings let me know and I
won't do them any more I personally like
them they get seem to get a really good
response from you all I get a lot of
views so as long as you guys seem to be
enjoying them I think Mimi box is going
to continue sending them to me Mimi box
is a Korean beauty but not a
subscription service but a beauty
product service where go on to Mimi box
and you on the website and you see what
boxes are available and then you can
just purchase whatever box sounds good
to you now you don't know really what's
in the box other than like the topic of
it like for example this is the Mimi box
hair and body to box so I know that this
is going to contain hair and body
products but that's pretty much all that
i know i am going to put a picture of
some of the current meany boxes that are
up there as of the editing of this video
they do change often so if you're
interested in one of the ones you see
right now make sure you go on quickly
because they may be gone so usually
they're around thirty dollars including
shipping to send and they do ship
worldwide without further ado let's go
ahead and get into what's in the Mimi
box and this again like I said is the
hair and body too and it comes with a
little card that has all the products on
it and I have learned that it's very
important for me to read this card
because most of the products have things
in Korean written all of them and I
don't know what it means I need to use
the card in the English translation to
help me so the first thing I'm seeing is
the relaxed calming shower son it looks
like maybe like a cleansing body wash
kind of situation Eva's cosmetics body
net seven days project and it's 200
milliliters is a full-size and it is six
dollars and at this 200 milliliter yes
it is so this is a full-size and it says
pamper your worn-out body and soul with
daily body gels from monday to sunday
each day is designated its own theme
range
graford detox and honey nourishment to
very complex revitalize every day these
energizing body gels and rich with
various gifts from Mother Nature I'm
confused it says son but then it says
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and
Friday on here so confuse I don't know
but either way this is a relaxed calming
shower gel and I will smell it I want to
smell you what do you smell like can I
get you open ah I'm gonna give up good
this way instead it has a little bit of
a berry sent an assault be sent it just
smells cleaning and nice I like the
smell of it it's got a nice smell but I
can't get the top of it open does it
have like some kind of protecting oh
it's got tape on it the I'm not even
open it I know what it smells like I'll
open it later alright moving on we have
the spa vitae berry treatment this is a
shampoo and this is a treatment let's
see what that means is that conditioner
I don't know ten kinds berry extracts
michelle has a shampoo your hair scalp
using fingertips rinse off then apply
the treatment and the same method so I'm
assuming it's a shampoo and a
conditioner lets us smell i'm always all
about the smells in my shower routine
smells like berries like straight-up
berries and cream
smells yummy next up we have the hair
salon argan oil essence concentrate
treatment professional formula boutique
baby mm-hmm 60 milliliters is $31 and
this is 60 milliliters hair salon
treatment right in your home it's the
last stage of your morning hair routine
even throughout the day when here's
feeling like it's going dry and
lustreless is my hair going dry and
lustreless to my need a little of this
okay so it comes out like a psycho cream
and let's do a little bit action in the
curly curls today do you like the curly
curls I did it with my new me reverse
and I'm not sponsored by new me never
have probably never will but I love my
new me reverse right here why does my
hair look shinier did it work let's look
at the monitor oh no does look any nicer
I'll be able to tell them I editing
maybe you guys can tell whether it did
anything or not it's got a really nice
smell oh just like an another like nice
clean fruity scent 30 cent missed mixed
with hair products it does smell like a
hair product like a hair salon so next I
have it looks like a nail polish and
this is by Elvita brush on universe
sweet i get two breasts the universe
onto my nails I have never done that
before that's pretty interesting i hope
i don't get sucked into a black hole
during crazy like that laveta lavender
oil has a floral fragrance make sure no
routine the healing point of your home
beauty care nurse just protects your
damaged nails which I need I have
serious damage nails cuz i pay my nails
way too much includes real lavender
pieces inside for a visual effect cool
and that cool look at that all those
cool little lavender or pieces in there
this is kind of a cheesy little flower
but show you what the brush looks like
just looks like a nail polish brush
nothing crazy doesn't have a super
strong smell it's my lavender but not
super strong very cool if it works it
will be in a favorites video my summer
favorites video if it doesn't work it
will be my summer favorites video as a
fail so I look for an update on this one
because I really want to try this I'm
excited probably most excited about this
in the box because I know I can really
use it and I have
nothing like it so not saying a lot
because I get a lot of subscription
boxes okay so now we have this box here
it's opened shocking whole juki sing the
natural skin take care of my body the
incredible story begins hold you get
creamed it told me to do it it made me
do it I didn't have a choice it said
that I needed to sing it and then it had
a little thing little jingle thing right
there as I had to sing it but sing the
natural skin it's got this little sexy
laid it on there got a little seal on I
got open up all the seals I got smell
everything all the factory senses needs
Samia stimulating smells good again
another fruity ish kind of smell more a
citrusy fruity label young shocking
whole juki 100 millilitres is $21 and
this is probably a hundred milliliters I
wouldn't imagine us being less than that
it's huge 100 milliliters it's a
slimming cream ooh bruise unnecessary
residues piled up deep within your skin
for a sleeker more even textured body
line all right I gotta address this
because a few of you have been asking me
like okay Jen you get all this stuff
from Korea what happens if it like gives
you cancer or if it like breaks you out
in this horrible rash and you're scarred
for life like what do you do you can't
sue a Korean company and and the answer
to that is I don't know what you do and
this is one of those things that kind of
freaks me out a little bit just because
it's supposed to seep into the skin and
change like the texture of under my skin
it's a little creepy to me within rich
natural ingredients such as green tea
extracts algae extract is gentles even
most sensitive skin absorbs smoothly
into your skin without being sticky or
irritant apply it wherever knee you need
slimming right now it is my hip buttocks
area I was running on the treadmill the
other day and uh yeah I could feel my
butt jiggling have you ever done that on
running when you feel like your butt
like you're fat is like jiggling as you
run I'm not saying I'm fat in any way
but I could I'm just saying I could feel
my butt going
up and down that was just not good like
my butt fat it's terrible so maybe this
will help me get rid of that I don't
know is it inappropriate to talk about
but that in a video I don't know but I
just did so I guess we'll just go with
it it says don't put it around your eyes
I can't imagine anyone has fat under
their eyes that they're trying to remove
and don't apply too much in one spot
because will result in redness from
excess thermal effect okay I'm a little
scared all right I'm gonna be emailing I
the company Mindy box company and see if
they know anything about the ingredients
for this maybe they can give those to me
and then I can look up the ingredients
for it maybe box has been really good
with communicating with me I don't know
how they are with people that don't get
promotional boxes but um you know
they've been really good communicate
with me so I'm going to ask them for the
ingredients of this before I use it and
if I find out the ingredients i will put
them in the description box below
alright so let's just move on from there
because this one's kind of freaking me
out a bit and let's go into the last
item which is the foot therapy one and a
half hour treatment as one of ours
forefoot they have a dreaming
paraben-free foot exfoliant wrap I
wonder okay i'm gonna read cuz i think I
might know what this is ever hood heard
of a foot therapy it basically looks
like a pair of translucent socks that
you wear for the next few days wait no
pair of trans which is like that you
wear and for the next few days dead skin
will gradually peel off from your feet
and voila the softest smoothest feet
you've ever you've always longed for my
friend mary lynn that you guys if you
watch my back so buddies you know who
Mary Glenn is she is the one that gets
on my face mask she has used these and
she says they're amazing I don't know
I'm just a little scared of my skin
peeling off if you guys ever tried
things like this that make your skin
peel off your feet because I'm a little
scared maybe y'all can make me feel
better about it or warn me that I should
not be using this I need any help with
this one from you guys because I don't
know about this one help please wear it
on both feet after cleansing and secure
it with tape around your ankle and then
you soak your feet in the gel for one
and a half hours then wash it off gently
with soap dead skin will start to peel
off within the next three to four days
so do you mind up with like dead skin
all on your side
like I guess if it's summertime you're
not going to have it is just gonna fall
all over the place just randomly I'm
gonna have dead skin cells all over my
carpet and it's gonna be terrible I
don't know about that I'm scared of this
all right so that's why many bucks so in
summary this box is about thirty thirty
two dollars including shipping in
summary this is what we've got we got
the foot therapy peel your skin off your
feet skin everywhere drama going on foot
there be we got the slimming body cream
that you can't put too much on because
it'll irritate your skin I'm scared of
that too we got the hair salon argan oil
smoothing treatment shininess
amazingness treatment that I do I'm
excited about that i'm definitely using
that we got the shampoo and treatments
or conditioner or something that smells
amazing excited about that we got the
body wash sunday body wash i think i'm
concluding that this is the sunday body
wash and for relaxing calming in the
shower which is going to be amazing
because i always need to relax and then
last thing is the thing I'm most excited
about which is the nail polish what's
not really nail polish the nail
treatment with lavender oil very excited
to try that so for me I mean these are
the things that I'm really really
excited about these three things the
nail polish this and this and actually
I'm really excited about this too so
this is well over were 30 of 32 dollars
or $34 whatever $32 i think is what this
costs including shipping so over i'm
very happy with this media box as always

think i've ever been unhappy with the
mean box ever and i'm looking forward to
