beauty test tube video and I was to
include this stuff in that video but
it's too long so let's just get straight
to the chase I've got a beauty box five
boxes by last one and it's my last one
because I don't like the subscription
anymore i'm expecting it to be crap so
we will see what happens with that and i
also got something from drugstore.com
AKA beauty.com they were having a nice
sale and I wanted to get my friend Emily
Lysette beauty a little birthday present
so I dude I just got one thing and I'm
excited about it and it is from malli
it's my first malli product oh I forgot
this was in here it's a little lip gloss
eat Louis oh it's like a Oh what's up
with the brush it's all wonky got like
fibers coming off of it
like a light brown color I'm not a big
fan of that color it'll probably end up
being pretty good though so is what it
is this smell good he smells really good
smells fruity but yeah that came in here
I didn't get it for that I got it for
this for most part this is shimmer shape
and glow face defining system and then
this is shimmer shimmer shape and glow
so a highlighter a bronzer and a blush
and will swatch us watching oh this is
the the deep peach one and it doesn't
look super pigmented there let's try the
bronzer that one looks a little nicer
kind of reminds me of like a lighter
version of Laguna and then this is the
highlight highway it's pretty kind of
reminds me of the one that I have in
mine arse for play a little bit but a
little less yellow changed then that one
this one's more of a peachy tinged so
definitely each going on in the
undertones of all of these but we'll try
it blushes a lot lighter than I thought
it was going to be especially for the
deep and this bronzer is definitely not
very deep so also in this we got a
couple brushes but they're supposed to
help you to like do the blush and the
bronzer and the contouring and all that
stuff but you've got this double end one
what are you doing body has relatively
dense I mean they don't seem oh I like
my mom I don't know they seem like
they're ok I'll try them and let you
know they're not yeah well I'm not super
impressed with the density so far hi
buddy give them on my hugs oh thank you
you say hi John hi and then what's this
in the bottom I forget now it's been a
while since at work this is called
brownstone oh it's an eyeshadow that's
where it comes with an eyeshadow him oh
that's pretty check that out and comes
with a little mirror with that and will
swatch that for you this actually looks
like a nice run sir but it's a nice just
deep brown shadow this is going to be
nice for on crease and maybe outer
corner if I just having like a real
match
oh look okay so that's what I got from
you d / drugstore com and now i'm going
to show you my beauty box 5 ok Reilly
joining me for a minute to open up
beauty box 5 you want to help you pull
stuff out I'm open yeah see what's in
here but let's say again I'm not
expecting anything fantastic in here ok
so this is interesting this goes with
this and we got a hair treatment it's
mostly a way to like kind of straighten
your hair without a flatiron this
product we got before and it did nothing
so I'm hoping this would be better this
is a styling spray so we'll see what
happens with that so this is a model co
which I started using their lip liners
and I really like them this is a model
co oh it must it looks like a black
eyeliner that's cool the lip liners that
I got from them were a little bit on the
dry side so I'm not sure how this is
going to work out but we'll see about
that Brianna's have their hi Brianna
she's watching I mean my neighbor's
watch any film Lila went away
okay um it's a little soft makes a nice
line I can see it's one of the really
likes but Penn sleep ensley one so I can
see it drying out relatively quickly but
we'll see we'll see what happens not
don't have high hopes for this lasting
long but it looks nice for now I'll let
you know in a favorites video if it ends
up being really good we're really bad
probably too heyla fresh look fresh has
been all over the beauty boxes lately
antiperspirant wipe for women I will put
this in my car because every once in a
while I forget to put on the deodorant
up like oh my gosh I did it by 200 in my
car I don't know if that's ever happened
before where you're like oh no and it's
summertime this is going in the car
hopefully doesn't dry out while it's in
the part but definitely we got two of
them I will definitely take that another
one of these Pharaoh well Pharaoh we got
up we got a blush from them before and
it like exploded everywhere I loved it
but it had horrible packaging where
there was no mineral blush but there was
no sceptre in the top so when you opened
it it went everywhere it was crazy so
let's see if they have this the same way
this is called golden cinnamon is the
color and I bet you they won't have a
filter on it nope it's already pooping
out it's already making a mess see what
is wrong with these people why half the
product is on the outside of the
container I don't I don't get that like
don't they realize this is happening I
mean it's a really pretty color it's
nice and like a milk chocolate brown
color i'll try to put this back on
without spilling as much I'm glad on
outside mmm this it's all over my hands
just from opening it
it's companies get their act together
because they make a nice product but
they need to learn how to pack up your
stuff so that's kind of the swatch from
the mess i think it's going to be really
pretty I really do I think it's going to
be really nice so I'm looking forward to
using that if I can keep from making a
huge mess and then the last thing we got
were two self-tan wipes which I will try
but I would much rather have had like a
little bottle of self tan instead of the
wipes but that's just personal
preference but overall I mean I feel
like these boxes that i canceled didn't
do too bad so we got four here so one
product to products three products for
products and five products so I mean I
don't think it's too bad um she said
because I want she wants me to play with
her so I'm gonna get off now and stop
talking to you and go play with my kid
so I hope you have a wonderful day or
evening if you're new to my channel hi
