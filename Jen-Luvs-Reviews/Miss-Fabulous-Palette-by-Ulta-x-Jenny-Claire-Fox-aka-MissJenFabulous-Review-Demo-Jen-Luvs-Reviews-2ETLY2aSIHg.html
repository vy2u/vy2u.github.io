like but these are high-end pellets and
this isn't considered to be a high-end
pellet just wait for it just wait for it
there's a reason why I'm doing this
hello my friends welcome to my review of
the Miss fabulous palette by uLTA Beauty
this palette was in collaboration with a
youtuber named Jenny Claire Fox her
YouTube channel is Miss Jen fabulous
I've actually been subscribed to her
channel for a really long time I found
her through her easy nail art for
beginners videos when I was getting all
into nail art and I really learned a lot
from her channel my favorite design that
I've ever done of hers it was the
fishtail nail art I thought that was the
most beautiful thing and it was so easy
to do and I couldn't believe how easy it
was so I am a huge miss Jen fabulous fan
so when I found it she was coming out
with a palette I was very excited and
decided to go out and purchase it and
review it for you so the way that this
review is going to work is I am going to
tell you a little bit about the palette
how much it costs I'll show you a little
demo of how I got this look today and
then I'll give you my full review on the
palette so let's talk about packaging
first of all this is a cardboard
packaging I really think that it is very
pretty it's got a print on it is not
texture but it is a print that looks
similar to like a high-end handbag I
know she likes her high-end handbags so
it's very her and it's got this pinky
tone to it it's got her picture on the
back and it's got the little youtube
symbol with her name and I'll read you
her little quote on the back it says
when creating this palette I knew I
wanted to go with warmer tones and she
did I wanted this to be extremely
wearable something you could reach for
every single day I love how all the
colors work together and you can really
can create so many different looks there
isn't a single color in here that I
wouldn't reach for which was a huge
must-have for me when creating the
shades I'm so excited about this palette
and I hope you love it as much as I do
the magnetic closure on here is quite
strong so if you're using it for travel
I think it would be great
it's also very hard packaging so that
makes it great for travel when you open
it up there is not a mirror there's just
kind of this little plastic window here
you get 12 shadows in here of them three
are matte fab Arizona and FRA
heeey the rest are shimmer shades you go
from light to medium to a little bit
deeper over on this side mostly warm
palette just like she mentioned and
there are these four brick-red kinds of
shades in the center Lewis here has a
little bit a touch of kind of an olive
green in it you've got kind of a berry
tone and mitten and then these kind of
champagne shimmery kinds of shades over
here these typical nude kinds of shades
you also get a brush with this this is a
shadow brush that's usually used for
packing on color these kinds of brushes
it is a smaller brush so if you have
hooded eyes or if you have smaller eyes
this will probably work very well for
you I have a little bit larger eyes but
I can definitely still work with it it
is a really nice brush I find it to be
of high quality so far and overall I
really like the packaging I think they
did a fantastic job on it so let me go
ahead and show you now how I got this
look so you can see how the eyeshadows
applied to me
the big thing I want to tell you about
what you just saw is that of the three
times that I have applied these shadows
to my eyes this is the first time that
the shadows have kind of muddied
together on me and I think I know why
and I think it is because I use latte
all over the lid and prior to this I was
using these shades over here to kind of
brighten up my lid before adding the
other shades and what I'm learning the
more I work with this is that these
shades over here are very very similar
in tone which don't provide a lot of
contrast so you really need these shades
over here in order to get your contrast
a big reason why you can't get a
contrast is there are no very deep
shades in here I really really wish
there was a deep matte brown in this
palette do I have deep matte Browns and
other palettes absolutely but as a
standalone palette I feel like it needed
that deep matte Brown or a black or
something to kind of give it that
ability to get more dimension especially
for a varied amount of skin tones I
watched a tutorial that Jen did with
this palette and she'd used fab as her
transition color fab is going to work as
a transition color if you look more like
Jen if you are very very fair-skinned if
you are of a medium to deep skin tone
this is going to be more of a lighter
lid shade for you and and there really
isn't a transition shade for you if you
are not of a light skin tone and there's
there's nothing there I mean I really
feel like this was designed for Jen by
Jen you know and and for people that
look like Jen which is no knock against
Jen she designed her perfect palette
which is wonderful but I don't feel like
it caters to a lot of people of a lot of
different skin tones I wish that she had
knocked out two of these burnt orange
reddish kinds of shades may be kept in
Frankie and guru gotten rid of Arizona
and cocoa put in here a transition shade
for deeper skin tones and then put in
here a deep matte Brown then I feel like
she really would have had some as far as
the shade range now as far as the
quality of the shadows the lasting power
has been very good for me they've lasted
me pretty much all day they do fade
through the day but I still have a
significant amount of color on my eyes
at the end of the day which makes me
very
I've used them with a variety of
different primers today I use the Mac
Paint Pot in painterly I've also used
matter bin decays Eden and I've used the
essence I heart color intensifying
primer and they've lasted all day for
all three this is actually the third
time I film this video because I've had
different errors so this is quite a few
hours after I filmed the demo portion so
you can see that the eye shadow still
looks exactly the same as it did when I
applied it a few hours ago they do kick
up product when you put the brush into
the shadow they will cook up product so
it's really important that you tap off
your brush so they should and don't end
up with fall out all over your cheeks I
haven't had a problem with fall out I
always make sure I tap out off my brush
and I've had no problem with that so now
that we've talked a little about the
quality of the eye shadows let's talk
about valium the mists gem fabulous
palette is $20 I want to compare it to a
few of the very popular high and
eyeshadows palettes that I own The Naked
palette the Too Faced chocolate bar
palette and the lorac Pro now your I
know you're already thinking like but
these are high-end palettes and this
isn't considered to be a high-end
palette just wait for it just wait for
it there's a reason why I'm doing this
okay so the miss Jen fabulous palette
you get 12 pans they are point six grams
each which equals seven point two grams
of product for the twenty dollars in the
Urban Decay Naked palette is 12
different eyeshadows they're one point
three grams apiece which equals fifteen
point six grams for $54 and then the Too
Faced chocolate bar palette you get 14 I
shadow zatt the 0.95 gram size and then
two at the 2.2 gram size which is 17.7
grams of product all together the lorac
Pro is 16 shadows at 0.55 grams that's
eight point eight grams of product for
$44 so what does that all mean well what
I did was I broke it down to price per
gram of product the Miss Ghent fabulous
palette breaks down to two dollars and
seventy eight cents per gram of product
the Urban Decay Naked palette is three
dollars and forty six cents per gram of
product to face chocolate bar palette
two dollars and seventy seven cents per
gram of product and then the low rack
the pro palette is five dollars per gram
of product at the most expensive believe
it or not
so if you think about it that way things
change a little bit the story changes
because these are if you think about it
price per gram of product these are very
very similar in what you are paying for
the to face is actually one cent cheaper
per gram of product than the miss Jim
Jim fabulous palette one other thing I
want to mention about the shadows and
this is going to be a personal
preference things for you so pay
attention this part okay will swatch Fox
from this Jen fabulous palette and will
swatch the creme brulee from the
chocolate bar palette I want to use you
to see the different level of shimmer
you're getting it depends on how much
shimmer you like and hopefully you can
see that so that you can see that the
level of shimmer we're talking about
here between the gem is shown fabulous
palette and the Too Faced palette as far
as the shimmer I personally prefer this
some of you may prefer this so for me I
would rather have shimmery or eyeshadows
that are in this then the less shimmer
here but if you have a few older lids if
you have more wrinkly lids creepier lids
this may be a better option for you
because it's not so shimmery a lot of a
lot of people say that the crepeyness is
accentuated by the shimmer so this may
be a better option for you price-wise if
you're on a budget and you don't have
enough money for this you might want to
get this especially if you like just a
more natural look if you are of djenne
skin tone you may want to get the miss
gent fabulous palette from me personally
I would much rather have the chocolate
bar palette I like the shade range much
better I like the smell of it much
better I think the quality is better the
lasting power is longer than the miss
Jen fabulous palette and again you're
paying of one cent less per gram of
product for the chocolate bar than you
are for this which really surprised me
when I did the math I was like holy moly
so to me this is not worth the $20 price
tag I feel like this would be worth the
twelve to fifteen dollar range I think
would be a fair price for this not the
twenty dollar price range I would not
recommend this at that twenty dollar
price point I don't think it's worth it
unless you are that person that I just
described it looks like Jen may be a
little bit older or like
more natural of a look for eye shadows
