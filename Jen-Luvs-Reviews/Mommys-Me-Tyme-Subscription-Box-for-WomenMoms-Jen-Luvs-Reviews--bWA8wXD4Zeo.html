the subscription service mommy's me time
now i do want to apologize for the
lateness of this review i had scheduled
to do the november unboxing but do some
to some miscommunication that was
partially my fault i didn't yet the
november box until later in november and
my december shooting schedule was
completely booked and i was sick in
december so i didn't even get all the
december things up that i wanted to so
long story short too late i'm reviewing
the november box in january and i feel
really bad about that but I didn't want
to show you because I did get this box
for review and it's something that I had
never heard of before so I am excited to
show you what's in it to see whether
this would be good for you or not now
this because it's called mommy's me time
it doesn't mean that it can't be for
people that aren't moms I think it's
mostly focused toward women and things
that women would enjoy I did watch the
previous box openings including one from
subscription box mom who is awesome and
she reviewed it in her box she got a
full-size Yankee Candle I saw one by
someone that I wasn't familiar with she
got a full-size hair straightener so I
mean there's definitely some good
potential in this box this subscription
is thirty-eight dollars a month
including shipping which to me is a bit
pricey but you do get some nice sized
items and i'll show you the good ones we
got we're definitely got a really good
one this month i'll show you the less
exciting things first and then i'll show
you the most exciting things at least
for me the first thing we got is this
and this is a bath and Bodyworks set
portable car freshener clip and the
retail price on this is 550 and it comes
with the scent in it and i'm not sure
what since i got it doesn't say it on
here but it comes with this little pod
and it does not say what sense it is but
it smells like a fruity kind of scent it
smells very very nice as far as the
design of this i think it's a bit cheesy
it's not really my style i will be using
it i will put it in my car but i'm not
sure if i'll buy refills for this or not
no my part might be able to rock it oh
no I'm gonna have to try it out in there
and see but not something that I would
probably would have purchased but I'm
sure a lot of people would enjoy that
the next thing we got was a Maybelline
Baby Lips doctor rescue medicated bomb
and i'll have to check with my friend
vanessa over at vadas rad to see if she
has this one I'm assuming she does she
is a myth Maybelline Baby Lips junkie
you know what I didn't know if I owned
any Maybelline Baby Lips anymore i used
to own one or two where they first came
out but I you know have since used them
lost them whatever and it's this one is
in berry soft got a little bit of a
berry color to it which is really cool
hmm interesting I would have expected
something that's called very soft to
have more of a berry snow but it's got
like that medicated smell to it so I am
excited to happen though especially in
the winter time you know cuz now my lips
are like super dry cuz now it's like
January alright next thing we got was
something that I thought was very
interesting it's not really my style but
I can see where someone would think this
is very cute and fun and it is a jewelry
corset organizer and the choices were
black or pink and it's like a hang on
the those like this and you hang it on
your closet or you can hang on a hanger
I guess and you can hang all your
jewelry in it and it looks like a like a
corset like that um think about this is
it smells kind of funky it smells very
plasticky i'm not i'm not a fan of the
smell it is cute though it's kind of
funny and it's got you know little
pockets here to stick your stuff in
right there and it's got tons of room
for jewelry and everything unfortunately
I don't have a functional closet to put
this in I don't have a lot of room in my
house I live in a really small house so
I don't really have much use for this
but I will be saving this because when
we do move into a different house with
pouch was couch when we do move into a
different house which hopefully will be
within the next couple of years I may
have room to use something like this
especially for twenty dollars i don't
know i might pay seven to ten dollars
for this i feel like that's a little bit
overpriced
so the lasting that was in here because
this is considered one thing the scent
is considered another thing this is
considered a third thing this is number
four and the next one is five six and
seven but this is cool okay this is one
of those heart it's called a rhinestone
heart living locket and the retail price
on this is forty four dollars and I can
see this being sold for forty four
dollars because it's that stinking cool
okay so this is what it looks like this
is how it comes and look how beautiful
that is and what you do is you open up
the locket and you put charms in there
to represent you and your family so
that's how it opens there so it came
with a little green stone and then also
a little Swan which i think is super
cute alright so there's a little Swan
that they put in there it also comes
with this nice chain which i think is
very nice i love chains like this so
it's kind of one of those snake chains
the only thing that I don't like about
these kinds of changes they tend to get
stuck in my hair but they are really
pretty so I kind of suffer through in
order to wear necklaces like this oh
it's got a magnetic closure cool so it
closes with a magnet which is even that
much better because it's going to stay
better that way and it's not going to
break and then this is how how it would
go like this and I think that's
absolutely stinkin adorable now the Swan
I think is something that's really
interesting that I'm really glad that
they put in there because I feel like
that is something that pretty much every
woman can kind of relate to you know
turning from the ugly duckling into the
swan kind of thing or growing up or
however you want to relate it I feel
like we can all kind of relate to that
story in one way or another now they do
say that it comes with two charms and
the value of each charm is five dollars
I would never pay five dollars for that
little tiny stone but i would pay uh i
don't know what about five dollars for
the little I don't know maybe cuz he's
really cool that little Swan maybe if I
was really feeling in the mood of
getting something and splurging on
something I might pay you know I don't
know I don't know if I pay five dollars
for it Who am I kidding i would pay five
dollars for but
is really really super cute so what I'm
gonna have to do is find some things
that more relate to me and put it in
here and the kids may be little stones
for the kids birthstones things like
that there's lots of little stone stores
you can get a little chips of stones
birthstones and things that i would love
to put in here for my family so I do
feel like this was worth the price of
the subscription the thirty-eight
dollars um i would i would pay thirty
eight dollars for this to be completely
honest because I'm such a SAP I love
things like that and then the other
stuff is kind of a bonus I probably
wouldn't have purchased this this I
think is definitely worth the four or
five dollars however much that costs and
then the this I would have paid a few
dollars for that as well but I think the
big win in this box is definitely the
necklace so if you want wouldn't be into
the necklace you probably wouldn't have
liked this box very much but I
personally feel like it's worth a
subscription price you just because of
this so overall I am very happy with
this subscription for this month I do
feel like it's a big gamble because
you're gonna have to really love that
one big item where the one was a hair
straightener and the other big item was
the full giant yankee candle so if you
don't love the big item then you might
not like what you got for the month
because it seems like the smaller items
are very like yeah they're okay you know
nothing magical but you i will
definitely linked to subscription box
