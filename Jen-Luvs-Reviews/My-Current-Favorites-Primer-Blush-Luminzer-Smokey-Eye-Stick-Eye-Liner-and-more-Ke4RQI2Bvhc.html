of backwards requested of me kind of by
one of my subscribers her name is Maria
Jane's and she had a question for me she
said do you actually use all of these
products that you review and um the
answer is yes but see the thing is i
have i have so many products at this
point i don't have nearly as much as
some people that i watch like for
example like shades of cassie or
emilynoel83 um you know even probably
body morales um you know some of these
people have such a ridiculous amount of
product like I didn't even imagine like
what it must be like to have he like
swimming in that much product but I have
I have a lot of product but there are
certain products that just call out to
me and they say use me you must use me
so these are the products that I have
just been absolutely loving lately and
the first one want to tell you about is
one that I've told you about before and
it's my Mirabella primer I just really
enjoy the way this makes my face feel I
like the way that my makeup goes on over
top of it and I really like the way my
makeup looks you know 10 hours later I I
think that it's just a really nice
primer it's one of those silicone liners
abs liners one of the silicone framers
and I just really enjoy it a lot my
favorite blush right now is by the bomb
and it's the down boy actually I have
two favorite blushes this one the bomb
down boy I just got and I love this
blush let me show you this Scout of the
mirror and it says on the top so many
men so little time and then it says it
in French but this is it's very powdery
that's my only complaint about it that's
watched there we show you its watch on
my hand um it's very very very pigment
you have to be really careful with you
if you use a very soft soft touch with
it or else you end up just looking with
a clown but it's just a really nice mall
be kind of pink color and I'm really
enjoying that another blush that I'm
really really enjoying is this everyday
minerals one that I got which I'm very
surprised at how much I like it it's
called snuggle and it's got a little bit
of a shimmer to it where the bomb one is
Matt and it's dark this one is a little
shimmery on it it isn't
blush and it is very light colored but
you see the color difference right away
and why one calls to me on one day one
might call to me on another day I put on
a lot they're just so that you could see
it because it is so stinking light but
it's just just the very light beautiful
pink and it just gives a really nice
color it's got a little bit of a shimmer
to it but not an obnoxious shimmer just
absolutely love that also for face
products this I got um I was a five
don't tell okay just don't tell anybody
it was a 500-point perk I got a buxom um
set and it had some really cool products
in it and this was one of them and it's
a highlight it reminds me a lot of
benefits high beam but it is a little
bit darker in color so if you have a
little bit darker skin tone and high
beams too light for you you might want
to try this buck someone let me show you
how this looks but see how it's a little
dark on my skin but it doesn't end up
looking dark on my cheek especially when
I blend it in it's got a really nice
shimmer to it it's just really really
pretty i really enjoy that a lot and he
calls to me it says use me as your
highlighter use me all right another
thing that just i cannot get away from
this thing because it's like I have like
little pallets of eyeshadow and then
I've got bigger pallets of eyeshadow and
what a little pellet doesn't cut it I
reach for my Urban Decay vice palette
because it literally has everything in
it I could possibly want and I apologize
for the fluffiness of the mess of it I
use it all the time but I mean it's got
craze it's got neutral colors it's got a
black it's got all these different
bright colors if I want to go bright I
mean it's got every color you could
possibly want in this thing to make it i
look so whenever I have a pallet or an
eyeshadow that just isn't it's not
enough I reach for this and it will give
me whatever color I'm missing out of the
palette that I'm working with alright
the next thing that I love that I was so
shocked I love was also from that buxom
kit and it's a waterproof smokey eyes
stick and this does not go on like a
cream like I thought of what it actually
goes on like a powder okay so you put it
on like that in the corner see how dark
that is okay and then you take your
fluffy and you kind of circle it around
and see how it blends out
isn't that cool look at that so neat how
it's not sharp anymore oh it's such Ono
look what i just did all my vice palette
I am a hot mess sorry black market I did
not mean to do that to you so yeah
really loving this shot because I've
never even heard of this thing and like
ever so really happy with that for
eyeliners I just got a bunch of
two-faced stuff for the giveaway and
stuff for myself and this is the perfect
eyes waterproof eyeliner in perfect
black and this is just a really smooth
liner let me just show you how that
applies bloop I mean just beautiful I
mean so blackity black black and just
gorgeous stays on all day really stays
on nice in my waterline who knew so
excited about this liner also for I
products I took the recommendation of
some of my friends here on YouTube this
is the Rimmel scandaleyes liner and this
is for your waterline to brighten up
your eyes and you probably will not be
able to see this on my skin because it
almost matches my skin to them perfectly
which is really nice to brighten up my
eyes in the morning when I am super
super sleepy so I am loving this and the
best part is I got this on sale at
walgreens for two dollars whoa I had a
list of all people that recommended this
to me and then I deleted it it all
deleted it all deleted and I'm so upset
I had like six months worth of makeup
suggestions and it all got deleted but
so many people have recommend this it's
fabulous if you don't have one of these
go get it because it's just wonderful
for sleepy eyeballs another thing that's
kind of a dramatic fun eyeliner I
actually wear this to work because I'm a
teacher and I can get away with it
because i work with little kids and i
just say oh the kids love the glitter
this is the nick liquid crystal liner
and crystal pewter and it's just
gorgeous and i like to put it on kind of
like a thicker black liner and then just
put this right by my lash line so i'm
going to put that right next to here so
you can see how pretty that is look at
that isn't that gorgeous i mean if
you're at college kid and you're going
out like dancin or whatever
out to clubs this is like I wish I had
this when I was 21 22 like this is just
the most gorgeous sinking liner and it
stays on and it's just so glittery and
beautiful yeah love love love love in
this liner my last product that I am
loving I figured out how to describe
this it is as if a Revlon kissable balm
stain had a baby in baby lips and it is
the Neutrogena moisture smooth color
stick and I'm wearing that today and it
is just such a fun product it does not
stay on like a Revlon kissable balm
stain but it's way way way more
pigmented than the baby lips so
pigmented like this but stays on like
this moisturizes like this very very
very moisturizing it makes my lips just
feel amazing it feels like a
moisturizing lip balm but it's got some
really nice color to it it smells so
good like supposedly they all smell
different this one is in its like
watermelon or something yep this one's
called sweet watermelon and it does
smell like watermelon smells so good oh
love it alright so those are my current
