many requests for makeup collection

palate collection in the palette tag
that I did it was a tad created by gland
moms which they're really fun channel

palate collection I'm gonna do like my
single eyeshadow collection and I'll do
my face product collection i'm just
gonna do them in pieces like over time i
am a serious blush attic like I love my
blush let's do blush bronzers and
highlighters and let's just knock them
all out in this video so I know this
video's gonna be super long so I'm going
to stop with the rambling now and I'm
gonna get right into my blush collection
now you cannot before I show you I'm
gonna make you promise me something
because you know we're friends and all
you got to promise me you're not going
to laugh at my organization or lack
thereof I am planning on getting some
kind of organization system at some
point it just hasn't been a priority I
don't know about you whether you guys
have the ability to prioritize and
organize things or whether you're like
into that that's just not my thing so I
just haven't organized it yet so it's
not going to be one of those frou-frou
beauty guru blush collections where
everything's all lined up and beautiful
i love Laura over at mrs. Lowe linen
she's got the best most beautiful
organization system ever i adore her but
i just can't I'm just not like that
that's just not me so you're gonna see a
hot mess and I'm gonna show it to you
right now alright so this is my blush
store guys I know I told you it's a mess
it's a hot mess so this is my bobby
brown and this is a shimmer brick in
apricot and this is a limited edition
and I do really like this but I don't
find myself using it that often it's
really pretty though this is something
let me tell you I I had a company called
ed I've contact me and it's a place
where you can get rid of like your old
makeup so this is something that I've
got up on my ed right now this is the
Mallee shimmer shape and glow it wasn't
pigmented enough for me I didn't really
enjoy it i am going i'm getting giving
it away well i'm trading with somebody
gon eat it for it so yeah that time with
me is limited on this one I was not a
fan will not be by
anymore malli uh blush brushes bronzers
things like that unless you guys say
that they're awesome that I might try
them again sometime alright this I just
got and I am in love hi Susan she's my
girl that loves these and I'll put her
channel down below she's awesome i love
this hourglass palette it's back at
sephora i didn't get it the first time
it was out i neglected it because it's
just the price point is just so stupid
it's ridiculous for makeup product but
when it came back i just had to get it
and i really love it the middle one is
my absolute favorite for filming it just
gives such a beautiful glow if you're
going to be photographed I mean this one
is amazing this is the incandescent
light that one I highly recommend oh
gosh it's beautiful cosmetics bronzer
love this as well I'm actually wearing
this one today this is the CC ombre
bronzer and I love this product i've
talked about i think it was in my spring
favorites video it's just beautiful and
you can get three tones out of it you
can get a real shimmery tone you can get
a kind of a sort of shimmery and then
more matte down at the bottom it's still
got a little shimmer at the bottom but
love love love that product okay this is
another thing I got on my e div and this
is the Sonia Kashuk glow bronzer I had a
friend that was just in love with this
and so I got it and I don't like it it's
just I don't know it's just not
pigmented enough for me i don't i don't
really enjoy it so i'm getting rid of
that it this year is a cheek product i
think about this from the born pretty
sure of it is a chinese cheap product
and i really love love love this blush i
was shocked at how much i really liked
it sorry for the shadows but it's just a
beautiful corally pink this is my baby
right now this laura geller baked blush
and this one is in ethereal Rose I said
a wreath row once and was just stupid so
now I always say ethereal and it's just
a gorgeous gorgeous blush I don't really
pay attention to the two sides I just
kind of wing them all together and uh in
love with this okay let's move on to
down boy by the bomb love this one too
when you put your brush in there it just
powders up so I just got to keep it in
there collected for next time but this
is a beautiful mami tone pink and while
we're talking about the bomb let's talk
about Bahama Mama love this as well
gorgeous gorgeous bronze are really fun
to use I love this one for contouring
especially a little mini NARS Laguna I
got this and one of those sephora
favorites kits I don't think it's as
fantastic as everybody talks about
everybody says like at the end all be
y'all bronzers on I do like it it's a
great bronzer but I wouldn't say that
it's like magic or anything favorite
blush formula of all time this is the
kat von d blush ho ho this one is in
Essex my favorite year round blush
formula is so creamy and beautiful and a
highly recommend Kat Von D's blushes I
have two of them with this one I mostly
use for spring this one is in bellisima
that one is just a coral and such a
fantastic formula and just the lasting
power on these things is amazing I do
have some drug sort of pushes believe it
or not not too many though this is a
pearlescent pink by wet and wild this is
a fantastic blush this formula is
amazing if you haven't tried the wet and
wild blushes just you totally missing
out now present pink does have a little
bit of shimmer in it so it be aware of
that if you're going to get this one I
don't know why it on more of them i love
them probably because i don't need any
more blushes that's why I don't want
more of them I have a few tart blushes
this one is in frisky I got this in a
new Beauty test tube and it's just a
very bright vibrant pink this one's
beautiful for summertime it does have
sparkle in it though like ships sparkle
like it is not shimmer it is sparkles
dollface and this one was my very first
chart blush and I do love this one now
that I've worn past like the initial
like print on there it's a lot easier to
get the pigmentation but ish alee I was
not very impressed with us until I got
past that like film over top of it this
Mirabella blush I have loved this since
the day I got it it's very similar to
the Laura Geller one that I have as far
as the shimmers in it I've just had it a
lot longer and this was I don't know if
they still make this or not but this is
from the to the semi precious marble
blush and it's just beautiful it's got a
nice Sheen to it and yeah I just really
enjoy this one some street okay this is
another one on a diving the pixie
bronzer I had it in my eyeshadow
collection for a while but I just don't
like this thing at all it just I don't
know I'm the pigmentation on it's just
not there and even as an eyeshadow I
don't really enjoy it just real powdery
and I know some of you all really like
this one but it did just didn't work for
me model code blush this is actually a
really nice blush as well not my
favorite but it's nice a deep movie it's
a nice full blush and this one is in the
color amaretto sunsets be a bombshell
course can talk about be a bombshell I
guess
shun boxes you got stuff from be a
bombshell I guarantee it this is sweet
cheeks and this is another one that I
don't reach for often it's fine it's not
a bad blush it's just it's not my
favorite I mean it's it's fine so it
doesn't Wow me but but yeah it's a blush
no I missed this one when I was talking
about torque this one is in splendor and
I got this in a set this one is super
sparkly as well I don't know if they
sell this one anymore either because it
was in I think the holiday set and this
one is very interesting i actually got
this in a really old boxy charm when
they were doing drugstore products and i
initially really liked it but the more i
used it the more orangie this came out
on my skin tone on think you can see it
here but I'm just not a fan of this
product anymore i liked it at first but
you know and i don't think they make
this anymore this is the one sweep and
is there a shade in this yeah flush hey
this is one that i should put on ed this
is a healthy skin blends by neutrogena
this is straight-up orange it is in sun
kissed and I wouldn't call the sunkissed
I would call it sun kissed by a really
bad self tanner it's just really super
orange this one got lost I have been
neglecting this one I actually like this
this one's actually quite orange as well
but I really like this as just a
straight-up blush I don't like it as a
bronzer this is the master highlight by
face studio this one's relatively new i
think it's been out maybe six months or
so and this is in deep bronze i
definitely wouldn't call it a deep
bronze by any means no way is it the
deep bronze well got another tart blush
i forgot about this one to this one
needs to be in the front this is tipsy
tipsy needs me in the front it's
summertime favorite orange blush i don't
have very many orange blushes but i
really enjoy this once it's really
pretty like with a coral shirt or even
with blue like a bright blue shirt this
is really really pretty that's why i
need to organize this so i can put my
good stuff in the front why did i just
thank my tart blush I don't even know
I'm gonna break it goodness gracious you
said you want to see it now you're
seeing it alright hula by benefit had to
be here love this bronzer I haven't been
using as much lately because i've just
been loving my a cosmetics one this is
just a beautiful bronzer I've heard it
doesn't work for everybody but I love
that it's matt and i can contour with it
and i do enjoy this bronze were quite a
bit sugar bomb by benefit this actually
belongs to Stephanie over a little lady
Lori I was supposed to send it to her
and I come
we forgot about it till just now hey
Stephanie if you are watching this video
I am setting it to you I promise I
forgot I'm sorry had to try one of these
insane by the bomb this one is in argyll
and I love this formula oh my gosh I
don't know why I don't use this one more
often either that's in stained I
wouldn't say it stains but it definitely
stays on very very well this one needs
to move up in the front of the drawer to
see this is a great video because I can
move my favorite brushes to the front i
don't know how i ended up in the back
city color be matte blush this is the
only city color product that i have ever
really truly enjoyed and really really
liked i do have a few other products
from City color but this is only blush
that i own i think i got in ypsi and
it's just a beautiful blush really nice
formula staying power is not fantastic
but it's good and especially for out and
expensive is i think this is like a
three dollar blush oh my gosh another
thing I'm neglecting holy moly i love
this my friendly send i've gotten her to
buy a whole bunch of these things highly
send up she's watching this this one is
golden mosaic i love that you can make
it a little lighter by going down here a
little darker by going up there i mostly
use this for my cheeks not for
contouring because it's got that shimmer
there it's really nice to give my face a
nice glow and this is just beautiful i
love this formula the laura mercier
mosaics are fantastic this one is
another one that i got in a boxy charm
this one I actually really like this is
a project runway by L'Oreal I believe
this is a super blendable blush in the
Queen's blush and I know that this is no
longer available but it's a pretty nice
blush another one that I'm not going to
totally rate it out but I do enjoy it
this is another one I'm going to rave
about this is the eve pearl blush I got
this at IMATS and what you do with this
is you take a fan brush and you go back
and forth with the fan brush and then
you just put that on your cheeks then
you use the highlight to go on the tops
of your cheekbones you use the darker
color for under your cheekbones and it
just gives the most beautiful beautiful
look this is one of my favorite blushes
of all time as well I wish these things
were not so pricey either really really
love this finally broke down after
hanging out with Lee she from leash
eternally she convinced me to get a
Milani baked blush this one was on super
sale at some drug store so I got it it's
very sparkly I like the formula it's
just too sparkly for me this one is in
rowley nah I should probably eat did
this one as well all right let's go into
to face I have to to fish this one is
chocolate Soleil just by itself is just
a little sample I got that in a little
kit I think it came with a brush and a
little makeup bag and I like this
bronzer I don't reach for it a whole lot
but I do like and it does smell like
chocolate which was always a bonus this
is the Sun bunny bronzer for like one
summer I was using this all the time it
does have a little bit of a sheen to it
so it does give you that sunkissed glow
and I do really like it it's not my
favorite bronzer of all time definitely
can't contour with it but I do it would
like it it's a nice formula this is one
I don't think I've ever used this pran
sir because it just looks it looks
terrible it looks brassy and just I
don't know what I'm going to do with
that I've just never reached for it as
something else always looks more
appealing than this so i might eat you
have this as well this is mineral glow
with my cool skin tone it just look no
thanks buy this one is one that I got
back when I got a bunch of Mary Kay
products as samples from my friend Jen
this is in sandstone I don't remember
enjoying this a whole lot I wish I could
give a better review than that but I
don't want to give an inaccurate review
I don't remember being very pigmented
maybe it was just this shade little
booby baby sample of core least I to
love coralista one day when I'm feeling
a little weak it you know spending wise
i might get a full size of coralista
just because it's beautiful it's one of
those famous coral blushes along with an
artist orgasm and I just really really
love this color looks beautiful my skin
tone it's got a nice shimmer to it and I
love this this needs to move up to the
front too because this is a nice spring
summer blush this is another one I've
been neglecting that I actually really
liked this is a Pandora's makeup box and
I got this in boxy charm I think oh did
I just do that I totally just did that
that was not cool but it's really pretty
and it's very nice it stays on very very
well I really enjoyed this blush a lot
flips to mineral next we'll save cream
for last so this is the everyday
minerals I broke down and got a full
size of this i had a sample of it this
is a real Friday and I
this color I don't mind the mineral
stuff because I feel like it as long as
you tap your brush off its fine oh I
miss this one this is just a little mini
sample of a bare minerals blush and I
never reach for this I've never I forgot
I even had this this is in the one and I
got this in the beauty and bloom kid I
you know you got a bunch of little tiny
samples of things and I really liked at
the time I don't know why I've been
neglecting this this is actually a
really nice blush Madison Street beauty
they sent me this for review and I
really like this formula as well it goes
on a little bit heavy so you really have
to blend it out this one is in lotus
it's a beautiful color you just got to
really make sure you put it on with the
light hand and build it up ok another
everyday minerals blush this is the
first one that I owned and this one is
in snuggle it's a very very light
colored blush but it's really pretty
especially for when I'm really pale in
the wintertime and just need a little
bit of a little bit of a blush not
trying to go crazy this is another one
from Madison Street beauty this is in
hydrangea this one I didn't have to
worry about as much about using a light
hand but really enjoy that one a lot too
okay this one I just got in a glamour
doll I subscription this is by Giovanni
this one I don't like to use because it
doesn't have a sifter so it makes it
really difficult to get the right amount
of product on it's very very small for a
blush it's really hard to get out so not
having a sifter not being able to eat my
blush brush in there is it makes really
tricky and also it's it's kind of an
orange e toned color I don't know if you
can see that but I don't I don't reach
for this at all I don't I don't think
that it was a good color to send and I
wish that they had put a sifter in it I
wish that it had been a wider flatter
container last mineral blush is by bare
minerals and this one I gotten that
beauty in bloom kit as well this one is
in Rose radiance and it's another
beautiful rosy pink it's just a nice
blush I mean how much can you talk about
paint colors I feel like I'm you know as
a girl you know I got this pink this
shade of pink and that shade of pink
it's like dude how many blushes you
really need I need like three blushes I
don't know why I have this money I
really don't because I'm an addict
that's why I forgot to talk about these
these are some Nick's blushes that I
really really like this one is in
natural it's beautiful i love the next
blush formula if you don't
own any of these I definitely recommend
you check these out this one here I love
this color I wore this for fourth of
July we have for Christmas I were in the
fall all the time when I'm wearing like
a dark green shirt love this this is in
cinnamon I never would have picked this
out in a million years but it can't I
got on hautelook and super cheap much
this one's a deeper berry color this one
is in Desert Rose another really pretty
color there and this one I use as a
bronzer and this one is in cocoa and I
can contour with this one which I really
like to it's a little bit warmer so I
don't contour with it often but every
once in a while feeling a little frisky
I use this one so now onto some cream
products will get the highlighters last
I know a lot of people complain about
cream products and the biggest thing
about cream is you want to make sure you
put it on over your foundation but under
your face powder so that it lasts longer
this one's by mary kay I really really
like this one a lot it's in sheer bliss
and it's just beautiful really
easy-to-use really easy to go on and a
nice staying power on it as well this
was my holy grail blush for the longest
time this is a Sephora cream blush in
Rose glow if you go back to my very
first giveaway my favorite things
giveaway and this was in it you can see
it's getting a little old it's getting
cracked I don't reach for this anymore
like ever it's not that it's a bad
product I've changed my mind I just I
don't know it's getting old and it's
tired and I've used it a lot and I'm
just kind of done with it you know I'm
saying this is another one I've been
neglecting that I really liked a lot the
Make Up For Ever that was new in the
spring i believe and this one is in
number 225 i guess is all that it's
called I think it has an actual name but
it's not printed on there let me show
you how beautiful just a gorgeous
gorgeous gorgeous row peachy beautiful
and this one needs to move to the front
as well because i love this formula last
forever Makeup Forever that's the reason
it's cold that fails let me show you
some failed alright I hate these things
I absolutely these things I got them on
outlook maybe it's because I don't know
how to use them I don't know but this
one is in the blush and whisper rose and
this is a bronzer in Cocoa Beach oh my
gosh you've got to see these things
these things are terrible all right look
at that you know how many times I've
used this I've used this like maybe four
times it's hard as a brick now I think
these are going to have to go in the
trash like I hated them when they were
new terrible terrible i use
with a stippling brush I use them with a
regular blush brush I might keep that
one because it's still a little moist
and might be operator error but I hated
them in this one's trash because it's
all dried out alright the next cream
blush my biggest problem with it is that
it's oily and this came out this came
broke and actually if she gave me a
replacement product to this I don't like
the formula at all don't recommend that
one ok josie maran I'm not a fan of this
one at all this is a cheap gel it just
goes on is a very light wash of color it
looks like it's a real bright and bold
but it's not it kind of sucks I don't
like it this is another one that I don't
like this is a Korres cheek butter and
this is on my ed right now and I don't
like it like the josie maran one is just
kind of a wash of color and it's hard to
build up and I don't like it alright be
a bombshell of course more be a bomb
shows up I miss that that's a powder
blush miss that this one is in blind
date don't use it very often but if the
above show make some nice products and I
do like it it's just it's not my
favorite this is a stila and this is in
peony and this is a convertible color I
like this on the cheeks it is a very
natural very light wash of color liked
it a lot when I first got it but I think
that was because I didn't know any
better I didn't know of any better it
might just be the shade but I mean it's
fine it's just not fantastic we run that
stuff in here okay so let's talk about a
couple other things this is the almay
smart shade and this is a stain and it's
in berry I got this on sale okay it's
just weird to work with yeah it's like
grey it's just strange it makes a
strange color if you can see that but
it's just it's just weird it's really
hard to build up and I just I don't know
I don't really enjoy this product maybe
it's just the shade maybe it's operator
error but I don't really enjoy that
product either this is the bomb stay
niak it's the only product by the bomb
that I absolutely hated I have another
one that I don't really like but this
one I did not like it all I didn't feel
like it worked the way that I thought it
was supposed to when it stains
girlfriend it stains like it just sticks
there and like it doesn't blend and it's
just not fun to use and it's it smells
terrible and just look this is somebody
doesn't belong belong in there this is a
lipstick sealer this stuff hurts like
crazy that is a whole nother topic that
I need to tell you about on another
video this is a painful product this is
beauty is pain
that is this they must have said that
because of this product I got another
mineral blush this is by Pharaoh
cosmetics and this one's fine again
doesn't have a sifter on top so it's
really hard to work with the color is
nice and it works fine but I don't know
it's pain in the Bucky use I don't reach
for it couple of stick blushes for you
love this one this is the master glaze
by Maybelline really really like this
formula a lot I keep meaning to get more
of these but I don't need it so I don't
get it but I really really like this
formula a lot it stays on really nicely
goes on really easily very easy to build
very easy to blend this is the old
formula of the tart cheek stain and
flush and it's like a gel formula when
you need something really really quick
to go on these sticks are perfect this
one doesn't build very well it's it's
fine it's not my favorite I don't reach
for it anymore I used to reach for it a
lot but that just doesn't build up a
whole lot but really easy to go on very
quickly if you just want a light makeup
look really really fast this one will
work and while we're on the subject de
tarde I just got this and I do love this
one this one has a nice shimmer to it so
it's really nice for summer you know Kai
just kind of highlighting giving you
that glow it's really beautiful i'm
really enjoying using this one that's
when I like much better than the other
tart one the old formula I got these on
hautelook this woman was ok i don't
think it's bad but i wouldn't recommend
it this one's in hibiscus show you what
that looks like this one is in tulip so
its a bright bright pink this one is in
tea rose and this one's actually my
favorite of the three if I were to
recommend any of them this tea rose
would be the one of the three that I
would recommend and then finally be a
bombshell this isn't flustered this is
called the one stick this is supposed to
be used for lips or cheeks this thing
has so much glitter in it like I would
never use this on my lips it's just
ridiculous looking on my lips look at
that look at that that's crazy like I
don't know I would never put that on my
lips with the glitter and everything can
you see the glitter look you try to
blend it out for a blush it's just too
much it's too crazy I never reach for
this I should give this as well my blush
drawer is empty now I'm going to show
you my highlighters ok this madness is
where I keep all my highlighters and
foundations and my some samples like it
is a stinking hot mess so I'm going to
pull the highlighters
and I'm great back all right so I forgot
to tell you about this this is the other
product that i don't really like from
the bomb and it's the how about them
apples cheek and lip cream palette the
formula is just not fantastic it just
did not well me the way that I thought
it was this is actually on a tip right
now trying to get rid of that I meant to
do a video review of these babies and I
just never did I mean for the price I
think they're like twelve or thirteen
dollars a piece like they're really
stupidly priced I got them for buy one
get one half off that's why I have to I
particularly don't like this one it's
like a pink or highlight and just looks
really bad on me this one isn't horrible
but it's just it's okay this one here
this is a buxom highlight and I actually
really like this one a lot it blends
really nicely into my skin I think
that's where this one fails is this one
just kind of sits on top of my skin
where this one blends in if that makes
any sense and this one is in Venus and I
got this i think as part of a 500-point
perk at sephora and really really like
that same problem i had with this
illuminator i had problems with the
Knicks won the next one I believe is a
little more shimmery than the Revlon one
but again not super wowed by that sorry
drugstore i'm not doing it on purpose
i'm just not happy with it this is the
wats up i got this as the birthday gift
from sephora just a little boobie sample
and i really like this one a lot
actually it's a really nice highlight it
kind of just blends in really really
nicely into my skin it's just a really
nice highlight high beam you know I used
to love my high beam until I I tried
some other things and now I'm not as
crazy about high beam as I used to be
it's a fine highlighter but again it
sits on the skin and doesn't seem to
really blend into my skin very well some
damn I like a little bit better but not
much I save it kind of for summertime
but I honestly haven't used it a whole
lot this summer I don't really reach for
it neither one of them really blow me
away this elf one was given to me as a
gift from my friend Tiffany it's fine
for drugstore compared to the other ones
I mean it's not any not good you know I
would say if I had to choose between
these these the Revlon formula and the
elf formula I would choose the outfit
good one for elf it's not a fantastic
highlighter by any means but it's
definitely better than the other drug
store highlights that I have the it
cosmetics one you know when I first
got this I really really liked it a lot
and now it's not wowing me as much it
almost seems like it's drying out do you
see that the texture is a little bit odd
again it sits on top of my skin instead
of blending in it's not as beautiful as
I thought it should be now you want to
talk about a beautiful highlight let's
go into Mary Lou Mary Lou is famous for
a reason Mary Lou is amazing ok this
highlight is the most beautiful
highlight I have ever used it's an exact
duplicate alat it's fantastic I mean I
don't I can't get this kind of glow
except for my hourglass one which I
would say is you know different but
equal in beauty to the mary-lou manizer
and this is a fraction of the price now
let's talk about Cindy Lou now Cindy Lou
is like the bad date ok Cindy Lou is you
know oh she's so beautiful look at her
and she this one did come cracked it
came like that so I got to kind of hold
it gently he went on a date with Mary
Lou and everything went really well and
then you broke up so you went out with
her sister Cindy and it just wasn't the
same you know I mean everybody was so
excited about cindy lou manizer coming
out and then you never heard about it
again and it was a reason it's just not
as glorious as Mary is Mary's fantastic
Mary Mary don't marry Cindy Cindy is
just kind of like I don't know like the
ugly younger sister or something that's
something that is cool that I do like is
this laura mercier wanna this was my
very first high-end highlight my husband
got this for me and I absolutely love it
it's gorgeous it's beautiful on sun
kissed or bronze skins one is in just
illuminators everyday minerals one this
one's a fine highlight it's not anything
fantastic it's a very subtle highlight
and this one I believe is it called
illuminator X so that's it for my
highlighter collection with you so
unexpectedly this turned into kind of a
makeup cleansing for me so this has
really been a great experience for me to
go through all these things so from here
over is going to all be Egypt the reason
why I'm not giving it away to my
subscribers is because they're all used
and I just don't feel comfortable giving
away things that I've actually used so
those are all going to be heed of that
I'm going to put them up soon so they
may all be on there before this video
even goes live some of them may not even
be available anymore but
go on and check it out and see if you're
interested in any of these and see if
you have anything you want to trade me
and maybe I'll trade you for it and then
the products over there are the ones
that are going to end up going in the
trash this is old this is old this is
old this is just disgusting and then
this one is chewy for me i would eat did
this but it's got the brokens hop and i
just don't feel comfortable putting that
on Edith because of that so this has
been great I got all this cleanse now
look I got it a little bit more
organized it's not quite as pack now yay
so I'm still keeping a stupid amount of
blush but at least is a little bit
better so thanks for helping me to do
that I appreciate all the requests that
helped me to clean this out yay so thank
you so much for going through that with
me that was awesome I got to get rid of
some stuff which is great just so you
guys know Edith is not sponsoring this
video I'm not getting paid to promote
them or anything they just shot me an
email and said hey check out our service
so I am and so far it's been fun i just
started on it today i haven't had a
whole lot of experience with it if you
guys want once i get some experience
with it all i'll make a whole video
about how it works and things that I've
learned tips and tricks and things like
that this might replace little black bag
in my life because little black bag died
because it was eaten by pose so this may
replace that where i can actually
instead of spending money i can actually
get rid of things i already own that I
didn't care for that somebody else might
want to try to trade for their stuff
that they didn't care for you know and
I'm not spending money but it's a
similar kind of thing where you're
trading things and I don't know just
it's just really cool at this video is
long enough I'm going to share my
featured video now i'm a featured
channel ok so the channel i'm going to
feature this video is my girl Carrie I
think you pronounce it Carrie Michelle
she used to have a channel back when I
first started this channel called sassy
soapbox beauty and she her along with a
net over an a.1 Nettie two point O were
my first people that ever agreed to do a
collaboration with me I had like seven
hundred subscribers and then again at
had like fifteen hundred and Carrie had
like twenty five hundred so I was
definitely the underdog of the three of
them and they agree to a collaboration
with me and it was fun we had a really
time and you know we really bonded
through it she deleted her sassy CEO
bucks beauty Channel and I lost touch
with her for a little while and I you
know finally she emailed me out of
nowhere and was like hey I'm coming back
youtube I was like yes and if you like
someone that's spicy you will like
Carrie Carrie is very brutally honest to
the point of sometimes she is just like
this product sucks okay it is outright
terrible like she will trash a product
like no joke if that's the way she feels
about Shaw so rave about products of
sheep that's the way she feels about it
but she's just got that grit to her
gorgeous and fun and her makeup
application is flawless she does
tutorials if you've never heard of sassy
soapbox beauty if you have that's where
you can find her I will link it down
below I am so thankful to call her my
friend I wish her the best of luck with
