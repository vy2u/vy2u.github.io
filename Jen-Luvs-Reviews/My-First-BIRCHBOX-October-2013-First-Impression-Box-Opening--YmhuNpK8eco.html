bring you don't I don don he's my very
first first box I like seriously like I
have been so hesitant to sign up for
this thing because when i first started
signing up for beauty boxes I saw the
birch boxes they were horrible all that
was ever in a birch box was like little
foil packs and little tiny like perfume
samples and like horribleness well my
friend Erica over at from brains to
beauty did a birch box opening and she
was explaining the Birchbox point system
and how it's really easy to like rack up
points and they get free products I was
like well in that case then I looked and
saw what she got in her Birchbox and I
was like yeah I definitely need to try
this because they have definitely
stepped up their game birchbox is ten
dollars per month so i figured ten
dollars if i do ones who don't like it I
don't have to do it anymore well of
course there's a little card it says
Beauty buzz I'm not going to look at it
because it tells me what's in it it's
wrapped like this inside da da okay
first thing I see is rose hips these
trucks out here don't they know I'm
filming a video the first thing I see is
the shades here organics rose hips black
soap do you deep pore facial cleanser I
have there it's like a hand like a body
butter like the hand cream and I
absolutely love it it's bananas and then
as mbale Bob's or something like that
and i love it but i don't really need a
deep pore facial cleanser so this will
either be given to a friend of mine or I
will put it in my giveaway box next up I
see this it says 12 benefits instantly
healthy hair treatment seals color
smooth repairs and improves sure well
we'll try it miss hair literally before
blow-drying okay I have a bunch of
products like this I have a feeling this
is probably like the it's a 10 miracle
leave-in stuff that i really like
strengthens for texts prevents flatiron
damage
so that's cool I will definitely be
trying this excited to try that oh I
think I see a nail polish yes I do it is
by roofing nail lacquer cool little
bottle very cute see what it looks like
mmm looks very thick it's very opaque
loving this very nice color for fall
maybe once I take this off I'll put this
one on and see how it works and then
last thing in here there's a lot of
stuff in here oh I'm excited about this
oh its benefits fake up I have wanted to
try this cried rate increased control
concealer oh I'm so excited to try this
this is one of those things that you
know I wanted to see if it was good but
I did not want to pay the full price
let's see what size we got ooh that
beautiful packaging oh my goodness when
you sign up for birchbox there's a
profile where you can type in all
different kinds of things like skin
colors so they have matched this to my
skin color which is really cool doesn't
look like you get a whole lot of sample
in there but you know we'll see yeah
it's like almost like a lip balm on the
side and then the colors in the middle
very interesting I didn't expect that to
see that in there alright so the last
thing that's in here is a oh look at
that look they just gave us like a
chapstick just you know hey we gave you
some stuff and let's give you a chap
stick to might as well moisture
hydration locks vanilla cream oh very
nice a tower moisture let's see oh I
heard good things I forgot who told me
this was good at gimme brow Oh was it
just green 518 I think it was i think it
was jessica greene 518 that says the
gimme brow is really good oh you get 50
points when you purchase the gimme brow
50 birchbox points okay save a dollar on
any chapstick hydration lot that's cool
so overall I'm very happy with my first
birchbox i will put the full value of
this birch box right there I think was
definitely worth ten bucks I mean just
in being able to try this and the nail
polish and i will probably really like
this this is getting passed on but i
will definitely use this so four out of
the five products in here i will
definitely be using
