first empties video I have a ridiculous
amount of trash to show you some of
these things are completely used up some
of them I just decided that I don't like
and I can't pass on for one reason or
another the other thing a lot of people
do an empties that I want to talk about
that i'm not going to do is what i
repurchase because chances are i'm not
going to repurchase any of this because
if I've already tried it I already know
what it's like I don't need to try it
again I there's too many products out
there to try so I'm not saying whether
I'll repurchase it I'm more saying I
whether i would recommend it or not but
I'm going to jump right in because I
have a lot of stuff to show you the
first thing I wanted to show you is the
stubble rich hot cocoa bye uh who's this
verified by philosophy love the smell of
this stuff really enjoy this my daughter
and I both love chocolate and love this
did find out that there's a lot of
really not so nice chemicals and
philosophies body products I don't know
how many more these i'm going to buy
even though they do smell amazing trash
okay next up I have be better than false
lashes by to face their lash system I
didn't hate this as much as I thought I
would I got it in the sephora favorites
kit tried really hard not to go back and
forth between the fibers and the the one
here the regular mascara i think the big
downfall of this mascara is that this
this one is a piece of junk this mascara
really stinks but if you use the fibers
along with a mascara that's actually
really good it actually kind of works so
what i would do is i would use a good
mascara i would put this over top and
then i would use this to top it off to
make it so that these kind of blend it
in and I really honestly didn't like
this mascara whole lot i was pretty sad
about it i heard some bad reviews on it
so i didn't have high hopes and it did
not change my opinion i still think that
this isn't that great of a product so
definitely not a good one don't
recommend next up is the dr brandt
collagen booster for all skin types I
didn't see any collagen boosting in my
life when I used this it may have had
some kind of internal skin benefits that
I was not aware of but no visible
anything awesome when I use that the new
Real Techniques sponge this thing is
hard as a rock I don't know what
happened to the
I think I might have used a water-based
foundation with this and that's why it
soaked up so much product but man this
thing got hard after her like I don't
know maybe maybe a month of like solid
using at two months of solid using it it
just seems to suck up the foundation it
just little stayed there and nothing I
could do no amount of washing or soaping
word I use the beauty blender cleanser
on it nothing helped this thing to
survive but still even with two months
of use it being cheaper so much cheaper
than the Beauty Blender I still think
this one's better than beauty blender
just because of how much cheaper it is
and it's amazing it works just as well
for the period of time it worked for me
okay next up is the 12 benefits instant
healthy hair treatment this is like a
heat protectant all those good things
love love love this love the way it made
my hair look I love the way my hair feel
just a really really nice product here
would definitely recommend that same
thing with this Toni &amp;amp; Guy one really
really enjoyed this these were all
Birchbox and other box samples I think
those were both Birchbox this one really
really enjoyed this and this I found at
target wherever they sell like their
higher end stuff really really enjoyed
that would recommend that as well this
here is the Napoleon Napoleon paired the
autopilot pre foundation skin primer
nothing magical for me with this it was
a lotion II kind of primer I don't know
I mean I didn't see any extra long way
or time or anything magical about this
I'm sure that it worked to a degree but
definitely would not it's not bad it's
just not great the knicks curved
eyeliner i finally decided to let this
one go this i used in my prancercise
video my Prancer no sighs parody video
that was about the best thing I got out
of this thing you know it just it's just
not it doesn't work well it's a pen
liner I didn't hate it I just didn't
love it it didn't stay on real great and
and using it wasn't as fantastic as I
thought it was going to be as far as the
ergonomics of it being you know this
whole curved shape is supposed to make
it easier to apply and I did seep into
my fine lines just a tiny bit not too
bad but just a tiny bit just not my
favorite pen
of all time all right this is the
L'Oreal Paris collagen moisture filler I
absolutely love this moisturizer
actually bought the tub version of this
they changed the packaging on it and I
did repurchase this and will continue to
repurchase this whatever I need a new
moisturizer which I'm probably never
going to run out of moisturizer for the
rest of my life at this point because of
all the subscription box they get but
really love this because the smell is
just very invigorating I really love the
way it smells kind of wakes me up in the
beginning of the day and also I love the
way it seeps into my skin and doesn't
leave my skin feeling greasy so love
love love love loving this moisturizer
and then next we had the BH Cosmetics
I'm pulling now because I have so much
stuff in arum it looked at in Reverend
that's why I'm kind of giggling a little
bit BH Cosmetics lovable lash mascara
and true black this was a junk mascara
clumped my lashes something horrible I
didn't use it a ton because I just
didn't want to suffer through using it
it just wasn't a good mascara for me I
didn't like the way it looked on my
lashes and if this is your favorite
mascara I'm so sorry it just didn't work
from my my particular lashes I didn't
enjoy it it didn't do anything for me so
and also didn't really lengthen it just
kind of clumped and then moved on I just
move okay this here this is the
covergirl lip perfection jumbo gloss
balm in oh yeah they don't put the
colors on here but anyway so this one
melted in my car so this one had to be
trash I do really like this formula
though it's got a very plasticky
lipstick II kind of smell but I mean it
is a really nice product really nice
formula terrible smell and melts in the
car so don't recommend leaving these in
your car this is the dr jart premium BB
cream hated this really did not like
this it turned my skin gray and I
stopped using it actually still have
some left and I'm throwing it away
because I hated the way it looked on my
skin just didn't like it this is the
only hendrickson truth cream advanced
hydration this is a moisturizer really
enjoyed this as well this was a really
really nice moisturizers anti-aging I
don't know that all that anti aging
stuff I mean it might have long-term
effects I didn't see anything magical
about this but I remember really
enjoying it the smell is very citrusy it
was a nice moisturizer while it lasted I
think
that's not this past December but the
December before in my FC i think and i
loved this Mirabella primer and it's
just one of the silicon based ones and i
absolutely love the way this felt on my
skin and I really felt like it made my
makeup last longer so definitely
recommend this one it's a nice nice nice
primer it is kind of expensive though if
i remember right but I got in the
subscription box this is oh I gotta give
this this is what i was looking for i
was looking for can give this to my
husband this is a boost it it's a
complexion enhancer this is for an
airbrush system and a they gave it to us
in a subscription box and i didn't have
an airbrush system sounds like one the
world's a point of that my husband
actually just bought airbrush makeup
because he's an artist and he's never
gotten into doing i like body painting
and airbrush I mean he just I don't know
he likes to explore all kinds art so he
actually just bought an airbrush kit so
I'm gonna give this to him I forgot I
was wondering what I did with the head
but I thought that was kind of weird to
get that in a subscription box when you
know most people don't have an airbrush
system I don't know this was my Kat Von
D a liner in trooper really loved this
while it was still alive unfortunately
it died it ran out on me was very sad to
see this go I have tried this in the
other colors and i did not enjoy it and
the other colors that i tried but the
black one and trooper is amazing it as a
pen liner really really nice but again
it died on me so i had to get rid of
that this is the em cosmetics mascara
and this is the lengthening mascara and
this did exactly that at lengthen it
gave no volume but it did give a really
nice length a little bit of clumping
kind of wet i enjoyed it i just had to
pair it with a mascara that was more
volumizing one that would separate my
lashes so it didn't just make them long
strings of lash but definitely
lengthening definitely agree with that
em cosmetics whoa we're just moving
through here moving on through this is
the live laugh the laugh with me Lili
benefit perfume very very floral but
didn't really enjoy it it dried out on
me and I'm not sad this is the boss
bozhe I think it's bow show you guys are
trying to teach me this and every time I
say wrong i think it's bullsh i would
think I said bossio last time the BB
cream this was ok that my big complaint
about this is it had glitter in it
big fan of that not a big fan of glitter
all over at my face and random places so
was not a fan of this BB cream at oh
yeah so that's going away this is the
ever firm cherry blossom mooring oil
nourishing botter bought body butter by
organics this stuff just smells terrible
i got this in a one of my first box each
arms and i still have a lot left it
smells really nice in the jar it smells
very cheery and very nice but as soon as
you put it on it's like chemical city
look so I this is full and I'm throwing
it away nobody that I talked to one of
it and it's too heavy for me to ship to
anybody so I'm not going to give it mail
it to anybody because that would cost me
a ridiculous amount to mail it the
miracle skin transformer I actually
really like this I've talked to a lot of
people about this and everybody they've
talked to has not liked it but I really
really enjoyed it is ridiculously
overpriced for the full size so I have
not bought the full size but when I get
in the money one day maybe when I hit
the lottery or something I don't buy
probably a full-size this because I did
really enjoy it but again for people
tell me they don't like this for one
reason or another but I really liked it
I thought it looked nice on my skin
lasting power was really good I don't
know this is the two-faced primed and
poreless love this stuff it's a really
nice pour filling primer most people
seem to agree that this is a really nice
primer and I really like it a lot this
was um the face pure purifying facial
wash was like almost like a slimy to go
on it was very very odd didn't make any
kind of ladder but it was like slimy it
was weird but it did clean my face there
and nicely and it didn't make my skin
feel dried out or anything so I did like
it it just had a really weird feel to go
on let's see I've got a bunch of makeup
remover wipes ok so the Neutrogena ones
are my holy grail makeup wipes will
always always always recommend those
love them the simple ones we're coming
for me they just weren't powerful enough
for me compared to the Neutrogena one so
i don't know if i would reverse these I
know alive you all really like these but
I don't like mine HD no one's better
this one here oh this one is by absolut
and if the pomegranate one smells like
straight-up barf like it made me want to
throw up every time I used it I'm so
sorry if you enjoy this product
I apologize if that offends you but it's
did I have to be honest it smelled like
throw-up to me and I had to fight
through using them I didn't want to
throw them away because they work pretty
nicely but they just smell terrible this
here is the kirkland brand I got this at
costco these I was actually surprised I
really really like these a lot i thought
they work just as well as my Neutrogena
so i may switch up some time from a
Neutrogena to the Kirkland ones because
I really enjoy these I thought these
were great my only thing about these is
they were it says now larger wipe they
were gigantic like way too big for my
face like I don't know what kind of face
those things are gonna cover like I
don't know how think they think my face
is but I don't need a white that's like
this big like it was insane how big
these things were and then this one is
the Jean Pierre cosmetics exfoliating
wipe which I thought was quite funny
because they the only reason why they
were in Foley exfoliates because they
had little bumps like it was like little
green bumps on these little square pad
I'd use like three of them at a time to
get my makeup off and I did feel like it
cleansed my skin not just took my makeup
off but the exfoliating thing I thought
was quite a joke because it was just a
little bumpy and and the smell was an
offensive or anything I mean they work
they were just too small and I thought
if exfoliating thing was just says
microbeads also known as a bump rightly
buxom show some skin weightless
foundation i did buy the full size of
this i loved this i do like a light to
medium coverage and that is what this
comes out to be so if you like a full
coverage this is definitely not for you
but if you like that light summertime
foundation this may be something you
want to get a sample of and try dim the
light is my shame and i love the stuff
it's a very nice foundation oh this
thing this is the last thing I'm going
to show you oh yeah okay I got two
things left to show you so this year
this broken bag I saved this broken
glass because of the stupidness of this
product this was a who made this this
was by I don't want to fight oh and it
was a shampoo and it was in a sample box
and it was in a glass jar who in the
world thinks it's a good idea to put
shampoo and a glass jar okay now this is
this is even more who is stupid enough
to put a glass jar in their shower yes
that's me and who is stupid enough to
draw
but in their shower and break glass all
over their shower that was me as well
really dumb packaging the product inside
the shampoo was like straight-up watery
like you know shampoo is supposed to
have like a consistency and it was so
watery it was like really hard to apply
because I was like trying to get it
uh-oh I just I first I hated the product
I hated the packaging and I almost bled
to death and then the last thing I want
to show you is another dislike and that
was the julep eyeliner in jet black this
stuff was awful I only used it just a
tiny tiny little bit because it ran down
my face after a few hours it was like
raccoon eyes hated this liner and am
getting rid of it because I did not like
it at all maybe it's just my eyes my
waterline my you know it wasn't on my
waterline it was my upper lash line and
it was all over my face and I it's the
worst liquid eyeliner I've ever used in
my life sorry julep I love you but I
hated the eyeliner that's my verdict on
that I don't recommend that one at all
so that's it for my empties I hope that
wasn't too terribly long feel like I've
been talking a long time wrote starting
to hurt oh but hopefully you enjoyed
that and if you did make sure you give
