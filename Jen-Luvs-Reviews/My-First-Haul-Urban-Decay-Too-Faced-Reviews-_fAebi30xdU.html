very exciting to share with you today I
about month ago or so I've got a ton of
urban decay and two-faced products urban
decay was having a sale and to face i
think was having a sale spent not ton of
money on makeup and i am so happy with
most of the things that i bought so let
me go ahead and show you what I got okay
so let's start off with urban decay now
first thing I got that was on sale was
the Urban Decay Book of Shadows for i
think is what it is and there were
things that was very happy about with
this and things that I was not happy
about with this when I watched reviews
on YouTube for this one of the big
things they said about they didn't like
was it it's too big and that's very true
this thing is too big shadows are
excellent love them favorite colors in
here I love Zephyr which is like a
peachy like white let me show you if you
can see that the Go Go whitish love that
and I love scamp for the brow bone love
that so this was like a loser good
brabham congress is a nice highlighter
color I like um midnight cowgirl is nice
it's another that's a good um like lid
color um I also like gunmetal for the
crease that one's really nice um
gravity's nice I'm having fun with that
one it's like a purple love that um but
yeah I mean I'm not unhappy with a
single color in here I know the people
that are collectors rope in decay so
there's repeats in here on blah blah
blah blah i am not a collector of urban
decay so I'm very excited about these
colors because I don't have any of them
the other thing I really like about this
comes with primer of course the Urban
Decay primer is wonderful if you don't
have urban decay primer again runic a
primer it is wonderful so urban decay
primer came with but my favorite thing
that I discovered if I finally found a
mascara that were super crow curling
mascara by urban decay love it um this
is probably the favorite
gara that I have ever used I've used
drug store I've used high-end I've used
all kinds of things and this one is my
new favorite now negative things I
already said that the box is too big it
came with like a little speaker thing to
plug into your phone so that you can
give your phone ladder um it's already
broken I the other thing that did not
work with this that I was not happy with
I have an iphone and it's supposed to
come with oh I think I think I even
through the little card away there was a
little seeds of how cute that is but it
was like a little card in here that had
like those little black and white little
skinny little Cody thingies um and I
took it out and I tried to use my little
smartphone like little reader so been
supposed to give you like videos of like
how to use the book of shadows and it
never worked I've tried using that app
before and it's always work except for
with this so i never got this thinking
little video things i think it had to do
with it the little card that it came on
was kind of shiny so i think that's why
it didn't like it but um but yeah that
was completely useless so therefore a
little cutesy mirror everything and the
little stand thing completely and
totally useless um but the products i
really liked so you know it is what it
is and so yeah so overall i like this
especially for on sale I would not have
bought been happy with this if I a
painful price for this I forgot one
thing in here that came in here how did
I forget it oh how did I forget this
thing oh this is the best ok this is
they're waterproof the 24-7 I pencil I
mean I'm sorry waterproof liquid
eyeliner ok positives and negatives
about the waterproof liquid eyeliner ok
so check this out so here's the little
teeny tiny little brush okay but check
this out ok makes a really nice long
blue really nice I'm telling you if you
make a mistake on this this stuff is
glued on your I forever so don't mess up
that's my advice because you're not
getting it off unless you take all your
eyeshadow off let go some eyeliners like
you can scrape it
and it'll come off but this stuff is
like instant drying so um yeah you've
got this on for life if you mess up and
it's really easy to mess up at least for
me not being the best makeup artists on
the planet like if you accidentally do
something like this which I've done
where you like kind of lay the UM lay
the the tube part down accidentally you
end up with a big glob a glob oh forget
it you are stuck and then it smears oh
my god Oh horrible but if you can apply
this correctly it will be your bestest
bestest bestest bestest bestest eyeliner
liquid eyeliner friends because it does
last all night it is a 24-hour situation
there I mean this stuff is really really
good if you can do it freckly okay the
next thing that I bought were these um
I've heard a lot of good things about
their glide on shadow pencils the Urban
Decay ones now i'm not sure what to
think about these again maybe it's
operator error maybe i just suck it
using them but i can't use these with
any powder eyeshadow it only seems to
work if i use them either alone or with
each other or with another pencil like
this but the Browns are all a little bit
different it goes um like a light to
dark i think i forget i forget which
word of these two were in but they're
different ones a little lighter ones a
little darker and i do like them don't
get me wrong i do like them they work
they stay on their creamy they don't
crease they're fantastic but i'm finding
them a little difficult to work with and
again it might just be me because i'm
not a makeup artist but i haven't used
it much because they're kind of pain in
the butt compared to the eyeshadows and
like these like i want to use these but
they like scream let me loud oh my gosh
on my eyeball like use sparingly a
hollow or else you will look like you
were straight out of 1984 and this
purple like I mean it's cool it's nice
but you chew you better be careful
especially the blue
okay the very last thing that I got I
broke down because I just had to break
down and I'm telling you it lives up to
the hype I'm telling you it's the holy
grail of Urban Decay makeup oh my gosh
my friends my friends my friends I
cannot tell you how glorious the Naked 2
palette is it's like God set makeup down
from heaven and gave us the Naked 2
palette I don't have the naked one
palette again this is my first urban
case that I've ever gotten but oh my
gosh is this the glorious this is
probably one of the reasons why don't
use those pencils very much because
these this is so easy this is like
idiot-proof and I'm a makeup idiot this
is idiot proof I'm telling you look at
okay these colors ok I know they look a
little bit boring okay they're fine but
let me tell you about oh my gosh I just
graduated to my black oh I totally just
scraped my black with my fingernail I'm
so mad about that all this didn't break
it when I do things like that but anyway
um the easiest I shadows on the planet
to blend oh my gosh I have never had I
shadows this easy to blend up they're
amazing ok so my favorite colors in here
all right oh and the brush the brush is
so cute and it looked so my sleep got a
nice little domi brush there for the
crease and then this is a nice little
blending brush at least that's what I
use it for not a makeup artist and my
favorite is busted busted is my favorite
crease color ever ok I better to show
you my finger cuz my hands not doing it
just it justice ok that was one little
swipe the other ones that I love I love
pistol is a really nice lid color it's
like a silvery like it's like a nice
base like lid color and then I'll of
verve is another shimmery that's like a
good like inner corner like hi lady you
know the great in here junks color love
it love it love it and foxy
be able to see this I swear it looks
better than that in person but that's a
really nice brow bone wanted let me tell
you the highlight of this okay and if
you have urban you can make up you've
have you probably ready have this but
again first time okay the black okay
I've had black eye shadows in my last
make a video I was talking about the kat
von d black I'm telling you the kat von
d black this is the problem okay when
you put on the kat von d black it's
there like your eye is black like no
joke black black black black black and
you've got black on your eye and you're
gonna look like Kat Von D by the time
you're done because that black is black
red black now this is the cool thing
about the Urban Decay one okay okay
check the pigmentation but watch the way
it blends okay see it looks really dark
but then you can blend it in okay and
you just get that really nice like
blended black like it just darkens it's
just like a nice darkening like to put
like a shadow like it's such good like
for that um V the outer V oh my gosh
it's wonderful I use the black for my
outer V almost every single day no
matter what the rest of my makeup looks
like because it's just so nice to just
darken it just a little bit it just
brings your eye shadow down and not down
up it brings your eye shadow darker just
a little notch without looking black I
haven't found a color in here that I
don't like I like them all and it was
worth fifty bucks to be completely
honest if you're not going to buy any
other eyeshadows for the rest of your
life you should buy one of the naked
bullets now I've heard this one's cooler
like cooler colors and naked one is like
warmer colors so whatever you are buy it
now on 22 fixed I've got came in this
little bag which of course i'm using for
all kinds of things get this cute little
bag and you get I think it's still on
sale they're actually right now if you
go to to face website I think this is
still on special but it's a two-faced
son bunny bronzer which I actually have
on now and I love it it comes with this
little brush that works really really
nicely i love it the thing is I God with
a little bit wet because i accidentally
my daughter i brush your teeth and I
the excellent put the brush down where
she had splashed water and then put it
right in my bronzer but it still works
even though I put it in my bronzer but I
really like this it's nice and subtle it
doesn't go on super thick you can really
really place it nicely it blends really
nicely into my skin love it can't say
enough good things about the to face
sunny bunny runs or definitely recommend
this the other thing that I got that I'm
not sure how came i know i got this
little baggie bag um this little bag I
got with it and I think it was the
little samples of well I guess they're
not samples because this stuff is
insanely expensive of the shadow
insurance look how tiny that is the
shadow insurance and the primed and
poreless I'd heard a lot of good things
and bad things about the Prime Nepalis
I'd heard really good things about the
shadow insurance so i wanted to get that
and it also came with their lash
injection mascara i think this is a
smaller version but i'm not sure i was
really excited about these um but I'm
not as excited anymore let me tell you
the prime importance I don't really have
issues with my skin so I don't know
about it being poreless I don't really
have issues with that I don't feel like
it made my makeup last longer really um
I only used it once but I should really
give it more of a chance I'm a jury
still out on the primed and poreless I'm
not really sure i couldnt really tell a
difference it seemed pretty much the
same to me I sure wouldn't buy this for
the full price of it which is insane and
I'll put it somewhere the full price of
a full size of this I wouldn't buy it
the shadow insurance I'm telling this
stuff definitely definitely works but I
don't see it being any better than the
Urban Decay it's pretty much the same
thing to me at least one day I put the
two faced on one side urban can other to
see which one would last longer and they
both lasted the same so pick choose
whichever one you happen to be buying
from at the time or whatever if you like
the packaging better now the big big poo
poo of this entire hall was defaced
mascara it does not work at all it is a
bunch of crap and I don't know if it's
because i think it was in the sale
section with those
things I don't know if like it was
already dried out by the time I got it
if I got a bad one but it's it's
terrible it does not work like at at all
here's the brush oh you can't see that
here's the brush um I have all those
marks so but don't know if you can see
but look hello where's the mascara I
don't know where you all right there you
are finally what is going on with this
it's like the opposite of clump there's
nothing there's no mascara where'd it go
let's see if it makes my arm hairs
longer know that even mean my arm hair
is longer Herremans it came on it's so
much better and so awesome the bear yeah
that's all my stuff so thank you very
much for watching my Urban Decay to
facehole</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
