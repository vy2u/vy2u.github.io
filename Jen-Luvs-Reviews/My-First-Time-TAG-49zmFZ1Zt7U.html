tag video I saw so many of these tags
going around and honestly I was really
scared to click on them until I saw the
Kristin game had done it and I was like
well Kristen did it it can't be that bad
because it just sounds so raunchy you
know the first time tag you know and
everybody's got these faces like the one
that I had in my thumbnail and it's I
just was scared to click on it but I was
really thankful to have finally clicked
on one and having to be Kristin's and I
left a comment on Kristen's video I'm
Kristin commented actually oh my gosh
Jen you should totally do this tag so I
take that as a tag from Kristin game who
I as Leah door if you don't know her
videos i will put a link to her channel
down below she is amazing she's a really
good at reviews which of course is my
favorite thing without further ado I
shall start the first time tag the first
question is do you still talk to your
first love no I am friends with him on
facebook and i actually have run into
him a couple of times his name is joe i
fell in love with Joe when I was in
eighth grade and he was so good-looking
and he was in 10th grade and I thought
it was so cool because i was dating joe
and we ended up breaking up because he
was actually interested in my best
friend and they ended up dating for a
while and I was quite bitter against her
for a while but of course I eventually
forgave her for that bout my first job
was at boston market so we're opening a
boston market near me and I did pretty
much everything there I learned how to
do the cooking and the cleaning and
greeting and everything it was a brand
new concept and I was part of one of the
first stores in my area my first car was
a 1984 chevy nova yes it was a good car
though ugly as it was it was a good car
i bought it for about two thousand
dollars for one of my brothers friends
and it lasted
until I decided I was going to upgrade
and buy a different car so I had it for
quite a while even though it was not not
a very attractive car if I might say so
who was the first person to text you
today my sister-in-law Amy who was in
the video where my niece and Amy and we
did the hair curling thing she texted me
this morning to tell me she wasn't going
to make it to the gym because she wasn't
feeling well who was the first person
you thought of this morning my son
because he came and tapped me on the
shoulder and said can I have milk mummy
so he was the first person I thought of
because his little face was right in my
face who was your first grade teacher
you know what's oh I do remember just
when in my head my first grade teachers
name was mrs. Darren JH and that's
pretty much all I remember about her she
was my homeroom teacher and my math
teacher and then miss crisp was my
reading teacher and I remember we did a
lot of worksheets in her class and I
remember that she was very mean and she
was old and wrinkly and scary and I did
not like her at all I remember this one
kid was absent for like a week and she
gave him this big stack of papers and I
remember telling her I didn't think that
that was fair that she gave him all
those papers I had some guts I was a
little kid I did a lot different people
when I didn't think they were being nice
to one of my friends I stood up for my
friends and always gotten a lot of
trouble for it too where did you go in
your first ride in an airplane to
Florida my first best friend was Ellie
Ellie lived a live next door to me I
remember her house with blue I think she
was Korean and she had this huge family
and I was she was like so so sweet and
cute and she had this bright smile and I
was so mean to her like I was the
biggest bully because I always wanted to
do what I want to do and she was so
sweet and cute that she would just do
whatever I wanted to do and I could like
push her around and I remember
when I was it was later on in our
friendship we've been friends for like
maybe a year or two and Ellie finally
got tired of me bullying her and she
actually punched me and I remember being
in her stairwell of her house and she
punched me and I was like what's up and
I ended up punching her back and we end
up having this fight and my older
brother was there he was cheering for
Ellie because he knew how mean I was to
her and he wanted her to win the fight
even though I wasn't very nice to her I
would so call her my first best friend
my first sleep over i remember was at my
friend reaches house and it was at
Christmas time that was when her
birthday was and I remember staying up
as late as I possibly could and and
ended up being just me but awake by
myself um because I want to say have an
omen stay up with me so I ended up being
up by myself men eventually fell asleep
just cuz I got bored who was the first
person I talk to you today my son i
already mentioned that i told him we
were out of milk is the first thing
first conversation i add the first
wedding i was in was a girl that I
worked with at a place called the cactus
grill we were hostess hostesses together
and her name was Robin and I was in many
many more after that before I got
married myself and I don't think I've
been in one since I actually got married
no I have been I've been in one since I
actually got married what was the first
thing i did this morning before i even
brushed my teeth or went to know they go
to the bathroom first i think i might
have gone to the bathroom first but the
basically the first thing i really truly
did this morning was i made my kids
breakfast port first concert I ever went
to was epic it was poison slaughter and
trickster mm-hmm I was a huge huge huge
CC fan if you guys don't know he was
I'll put a picture there but yeah he was
the only one who's funny cuz all my
friends we all had our one people that
we picked as our favorite band member of
poison and CC was the only one left so
because Ricky was married so we couldn't
pick him so yeah CC ended up being mine
I remember screaming really loud like in
the middle of the concert when it was
like super quiet and everybody turned
rather looked and you're like you are
such a freak first broken bone I don't
I've ever technically broken a bone I do
feel like I broke my big toe not too
long ago because it still hurts but I'm
not going to go to the doctor so I don't
think there's anything you can do about
a broken toe first piercing my first
piercing was when I was five not five
yeah I was in kindergarten for my
birthday and I wanted my ears pierced I
got my ears pierced first not
traditional piercing but when i was 20

then I got this one up here pierced but
this is since my belly button since
clothes first foreign country that I
went to I went on an exchange trip to
Canada when I was in high school with
the band because I was such a kiss-up in
high school that I somehow finagled my
way as like an assistant to the band I
got to go to Canada on their exchange
trip and it was really fun i had a great
time and remember we went down to
downtown toronto and had a great time
that was when i had my first kinder egg
and i fell in love with kinder eggs what
you can't get in the states anymore
which totally bums me out first movie I
remember seeing is Annie I loved Annie i
had a red polyester night gal not i used
to prance around my house wearing even
though it was ridiculously uncomfortable
and I used to dance and back then the
remote controls used to have a cord that
would connect connect to the VCR and I
would sing into the remote and then I
would throw it and one day my dad caught
me and yelled at me and I never did that
again the first detention I remember
that very well it was in the seventh
grade and it was also in an English
class and I can't remember what the
teachers name was but another really
mean teacher and she called my friend
grace stupid and I didn't like that she
said what she did was stupid and I
didn't like that so I said to her how
dare you talk to her like that and I got
detention my first roommate situation
