generation beauty recap and advice video
the recap is going to be short this is
going to be mostly an advice video if
you were thinking about attending
generation beauty as an attendee or a
creator there are there two very
different experiences they overlap a
little bit but they're very different
experiences so I'm gonna give you my
advice on going to gym beauty the best
way to save money and what you should
wear and for creators you know how to
approach brands things like that so
let's go ahead and get started with my
personal experience i seriously had a
fantastic time at generation beauty i
reminded me of i'm at but i felt like it
was for me you know last year I felt
like there were some things that could
be improved on this year there are very
few things that I feel like could be
improved on it I mean it really was a
wonderful experience I got to go to
creator day which was an event that they
had for 200 video creators to learn a
little bit more about connecting with
brands growing your audience working
with final cut pro things like that it
was also a wonderful networking
experience where I got to meet a lot of
youtubers including I got to sit next to
us to renew I love her I absolutely
adore her we got to spend a lot of time
together and a few other people some
instagramers I got to hang out with the
creator of a bridal magazine I mean just
all kinds of really really cool people
to hang out with it was amazing i will
put all their links down below but
Creator day was amazing the event was
amazing i got to meet all kinds of
wonderful people I got to spend time
with candy Johnson I got to spend time
with laura-leigh I got to see man emu
way again I got to see Patrick again I
got to introduce my nut myself to angel
mack daddy I got to see tati for the
first time and give her a giant hug I
got to spend some time with James and
Sabrina and talked to them about some
different things and that was really fun
and it was just a really nice experience
and of course I can't forget my sidekick
my partner in crime Sanders Kennedy we
got to spend a lot of time together we
kind of were ruling the world together
walking around generation beauty and I
got to take pictures for him he got to
take pictures for me and
and it was a great experience so thank
you Sanders for keeping me company it
was an absolute blast I'm not going to
go into all the products that I got
because there are so many videos about
the products that we got at generation
beauty so I'm just going to go into like
the tips and tricks and things like that
but I will list here and some of the
brands that I connected with and some of
the brands that I did receive product
from so if you're particularly
interested and products from any of
these brands definitely leave it in a
comment below and I will try to fit more
of their products in my reviews for
future so the first thing is definitely
hit that early bird rate they the prices
do go up for tickets as you go so soon
as you hear about generation beauty if
you're playing on going buy your tickets
early because you could be end up
spending four times as much for tickets
then you would at the early bird rate so
jump on those early bird tickets really
really important if your creator and you
are part of f cos and you get an invite
from Ipsy definitely jump on rsvping
right away because I took a while to
RSVP to to generation beauty there were
some mix ups and my invitations to
different events so definitely make sure
that you RSVP right away if you plan on
going and you got tickets set to you
from Ipsy another thing is about hotel
stay I stayed at an Airbnb which was
someone else's apartment and it was
stinking amazing it was the first time I
ever done Airbnb and it was the best
experience I had an entire apartment to
myself and it was in Brooklyn it wasn't
too terribly far away from the event it
was a little bit of a hike i ended up
taking an uber there but it was the best
experience i ended up paying less than
four hundred dollars for four nights
stay in an apartment all to myself and
it was it was a fantastic experience so
i definitely recommend checking out
Airbnb especially if you're going to New
York the San Francisco Airbnb look a
little creepy but the New York ones were
there were a lot of options and they all
looked really good and I was really
happy with the one that I ended up with
one really really really really really
important thing is wear comfortable
shoes so important last year generation
beauty if you've been on my channel for
a while you know this I gave myself a
stress fracture and actually killed part
of the tip of my second metatarsal on my
right foot because of booties I wore a
generation
for a weekend it was probably the
dumbest thing I've ever done in my life
pushing through the pain and I hurt my
foot and my foot is probably never going
to be the same so please please please
wear comfortable shoes learn from my
mistake because my I think my foot is
permanently damaged from wearing those
shoes at generation beauty last year so
please wear comfortable shoes I wore a
little ballet flats a lot of people
wearing cute little flats don't worry
about if you're wearing little flats you
can wear jeans to generation beauty
there were people wearing all kinds of
all kinds of outfits I mean from casual
to dresses and things like that so it's
really what you're comfortable in and
what you feel like shows your
personality and who you are but
definitely wear comfortable shoes please
when you get to generation beauty you
want to make sure you set a priority of
which brands you want to hit up first
sometimes if you wait too late you can
get to a booth and they're already out
of product it didn't happen as much this
year as it happened last year but it can
happen so make sure you hit up your
favorite booths first they on the FC
website sometimes they'll have the
brand's listed on the generation Beauty
website of who's going to be there but
if they don't as soon as you get there
you get a map that tells you all the
brands that are there set your
priorities number one number two number
three number four and hid them in that
order to make sure that you get the
products that you truly truly want if
you're a creator what I suggest you do
is go up to and ask for their PR person
a lot of times they'll let the creators
skip the line and get the product
without having to wait in the long
attendee line there were definitely less
creators there then there were attendees
shows there were not really special
lines for creators but sometimes they
would allow you to take the product
after you talk to the PR person instead
of waiting in line so if your Creator
that might be an advantage that you have
but either way you definitely want to
set priorities to which brand you talk
to and you go to first now going into
some tips and tricks for creators going
to generation beauty and some things
that I learned the first thing is make
sure you have business cards business
cards are so so important because it
gives you a way to have that brand reach
out to you after the event and also it
helps it to get their business card so
you can reach out to them afterward last
year I got a bunch of business cards
hoping that the brands would contact me
and
if you did this year I made sure to get
a bunch of brand business card so that I
can contact them back and make sure they
know how interested I am and working
with their brand because I like it the
other thing about approaching a brand is
before you go up to a brand make sure
you have in your head your favorite
products from that brand for example I
am NOT the biggest fan of tart
eyeshadows it's a personal preference I
know a lot of people love them but I am
a huge fan of their eyeliners I love
their their tardis eyeliner I love their
so fine liquid eyeliner so when I went
up to the brand I said hey can I tell
you what I feel like your most
underrated product or your eyeliners
your eyeliners are so wonderful and I
asked them if the so fine was a
permanent item because I don't I want to
make sure I stock up if it's going to be
a limited edition item since it came out
with the rainforest of the sea
collection so it shows that I have a
knowledge of their brand I know what's
good I you know it gives them a good
feeling of your not just somebody
walking up just wanting free product or
someone actually has a genuine vested
interest in their brand and have a spiel
about your brand when you walk up have a
thing that you say that talks about who
you are in a very short concise way so
my thing was something like hi my name
is Jen I have a channel called jen loss
reviews i have a weekly makeup news show
I talked a little bit about that and
then I went into when I also do
dedicated product reviews where we talk
about I introduce the product I show a
demo of the product and then I give my
full review of the product it's a very
unique format my channel is very
different in the YouTube world blah blah
blah so I had this whole like little
spiel that I kind of spit out and
depending on the person the way that
they were looking at me and whether they
seem distracted I gave them a shorter
spiel or a longer feel there were kind
of two versions of it there was the fast
one for yeah I don't really think this
person wants to talk to me and then the
longer one for people that actually seem
interested in what I had to say and
along the same lines of that don't be
don't be afraid of rejection meaning
that some brands just are only
interested in working with larger
channels and that's just kind of the way
that it is it's a business they're
looking for the most exposure possible
and they may not be interested in
looking at brands that are under a
hundred thousand subscribers or under
250,000 subscribers they may just not be
interested and that's not personal
against you it's a business decision
they have to pick and choose who they
want to be
affiliated with and you know you just
can't you try have to just try really
hard not to take it personally and move
on to brands that you feel like would
appreciate you and what you have to give
more I can't say that I don't have
something in the back of my head like
I'll remember you when i when my channel
has that many subscribers I'll remember
that you didn't want to talk to me don't
forget and all along those lines along
those lines is for everybody that goes
you never know who you're talking to you
never know who somebody is so if you're
an attendee you never know if you're
talking to the sister or the boyfriend
of your favorite creator you never know
if you're talking to the head of
marketing of a brand who just happens to
be walking around and you're in the food
truck line and start up a conversation
you know or you never know who's
listening either if you're having a
conversation you're talking badly about
a brand and then that brands PR rep is
right behind you like it really looks
bad on you so you have to make sure that
you are very careful what you say and
what you do and how you behave a
generation beauty to show your best face
if you want people to respect you in the
industry some people to be honest just
don't look the part you know some people
aren't completely glammed out but they
may be the PR rep in the most important
person you need to contact with a brand
so definitely make sure that you are
kind and respectful and treat everyone
like they're valued and important and
that also goes for brands if any brands
have to be watching this you never know
when a YouTube channel is going to blow
up so you always want to treat every
youtuber with respect because you will
remember we'll remember when you weren't
nice to us and we'll see what happens
I'm just kidding but no I'm not kidding
kidding not kidding you know also along
the lines of being kind to people is
just talking to as many people as
possible get to know people you know
enjoy being there with people who also
enjoy makeup along with you don't go
walk around with your head held high and
thinking you're above everybody because
your highlighter happens to be on point
you know you again you never know who
you're talking to so definitely make
sure that you have fantastic
conversations with as many people as
possible so that you can network and get
to know people and I'll just make your
experience that much better the last
thing I want to mention is for everybody
going generation beauty be prepared to
take bags of
makeup home you'll have big bag small
bags big products little products
especially if you live internationally
be prepared to be taking these products
home with you on the plane and if you're
living if you live in the United States
and are going on a plane make sure you
have room in your luggage for a giant
bag of makeup because even attendees end
up with all kinds of stuff it's not just
the creators ending up with the big swag
back from the cocktail party it's
everybody ends up with a ton of makeup
and product samples to take home so be
prepared for that as you go thank you so
much for watching this video and thank
you especially to ypsi and everyone at
generation beauty for making it happen
it was really a fantastic experience
thank you to all the brands that I had
the opportunity to talk to really
enjoyed it and I look forward to
connecting with a lot of brands and
reviewing a lot of products for you and
just in case you guys know those of you
that watch my videos that I'm now going
to doing YouTube full time I'm looking
for brand collaborations things like
that but you guys know that I'm not
going to compromise me and I'm not going
to compromise my relationship with you
you will always be my number one and
people watching my videos you know I my
loyalty always one hundred percent is to
you and I will always and forever keep
that in mind when i'm reviewing products
i will never give a positive review to a
product that i don't enjoy and that
doesn't matter how big I get or what
brand sponsorships I get you guys know
you can always trust me for honest
reviews so i want to mention that and
throw that in there i want to thank you
