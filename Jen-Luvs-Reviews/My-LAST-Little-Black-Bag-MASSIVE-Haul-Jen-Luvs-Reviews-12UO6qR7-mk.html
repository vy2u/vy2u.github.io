massive little black bag hall for you if
you've never heard of little black bag
little black bag is a really fun website
that can be very addicting but there are
some positives and negatives that I
would get into as I go through this
video basically what you do is you pick
out your item they giving your mystery
stuff and then you get a chance to trade
your items with other users for us for
seven days hello to my friend who has a
channel called little black bag addict I
I was thinking about you when I go is
getting all this stuff together and I
hope you really enjoy this video let me
just get into what happened and how I
ended up with so much stuff so my first
bag that I opened up I got this bag he
is by Elise hope it's like a crock look
in print this bag is the crock hobo and
I had my eye on this for a really long
time it been on the site forever and I
just really wanted it so I finally broke
down and got it the retail price on this
bag is ninety dollars all the things I
got in that order cost me about $65 so
this here and then I also got these
earrings these are by Katherine Stein
designs and they're just some really
cute little stud earrings and the retail
price on these was $16 I do feel like
that's a little overpriced for how I
feel like these are kind of not that
they're cheap looking they just don't
look there's not real nice I don't know
I guess they're about right $16 one
thing i want to show you about the bag
is that frustrating is it does come with
one of these dust bags it is very thin
but you know it's a nice dust bag to do
a nice home and then let me show you the
inside it does not come with an extended
shoulder strap but that is the print on
the inside so you've got the zipper in
the back and then you've got pockets in
the front here they're just it's two
pockets a bigger one and a smaller one
one thing I think is kind of strange as
it's got this plate here but there's
nothing on it it's just blank which i
think is kind of odd but it's not
distracting like odd the way it feels
inside it feels like a satin let's just
look at look up maybe like a satin scarf
you may get it target or something it
doesn't feel anything spectacular but it
doesn't feel super cheap either it is
really too
we thin i would imagine this would rip
after maybe about a year's worth of
solid where this would probably rip on
the inside the zipper feels really good
i do like that it dips closed in the top
I'm always dropping things out of my bag
so I love bags zip in the top the
hardware is silver it does have a zipper
here on the back it has the same print
on the inside and overall I am really
really happy with this bag alright the
next thing I got in that order was this
bracelet and this is by this is by Carol
Jah plays and it is called the round
opal stretch bracelet and it does
stretch so that's how the stones look
you can see you've got the two stones
here and then the larger stone here this
is not real opal and it's just a really
cute just basic bracelet on the inside
the elastic is clear if you can see that
there and I really like this bracelet
it's super cute the last thing that i
got in this order which i'm really happy
with and I don't have the packaging
anymore is this kenneth Cole watch I
needed a watch I actually got no watch
on groupon and it came broken but I took
a while to try to replace the battery
see if I could fix it and by the time I
replaced the battery I could not return
it and I was really upset about that so
I needed a new watch and this is the
kenneth cole new york snakeskin watch
and it's just really pretty it's very
well made nothing too fancy but just
really cute retail price on the bracelet
was twenty four dollars and the retail
price on the watch was mee mee mee mee
mee mee $95 so yeah so I was really
happy for $65 to get both the purse and
the brace and the watch and the earrings
and the bracelet and there was actually
something that I had ordered I had just
gotten some subscription box that had a
blush from Pandora's makeup box and I
was really excited I really like the
blush so I want to try some of their
eyeshadows why I had ordered this very
cool eyeshadow palette kind of see if
you can see on my phone so I got this i
traded for that and then
little by little black bag is relatively
good about getting things to you quickly
so i guess it was maybe a day or two
later i got this email and it says we
hope you are well unfortunately we were
not able to process your order fully due
to a warehouse era report regarding the
Pandora's makeup box very cool eyeshadow
palette $48 retail we're so sorry about
this because this happened during our
warehouse guarantee we have added 10
times the add to bag price of twenty
seven dollars which is two hundred
seventy dollars in merchandise credit on
your account and I went like I cannot I
couldn't believe it was real two hundred
and seventy dollars at work sites credit
so immediately I put it on my Instagram
like you have got to be kidding me so
everything else that I'm about to show
you I caught completely free now I would
have been happy with two times the
retail price like I'm not gonna complain
that they gave me ten times but I just
think that's a little excessive like I
don't want to see them go out of
business over something like that like
it's just craziness so I'm not going to
complain but at the same time I think
that was a bit excessive the ten times
the amount and I did spend it now i
don't know if it's because they know i
make videos I've never spoken with any
representatives of lip from a little
black bag personally so I don't I don't
know but I do know that every time I
upload a little black bag video it does
go directly to their site so maybe they
know that I'm going to show all their
stuff and that's why they gave me 10
times I don't know but I did get some
stuff and I do want to show it to you so
going into my second order I'm not
getting the eye shadow that i wanted i
ended up getting this cargo eyeshadow
quad in my second order and this is
amazing i love love love this eyeshadow
quad let me show you so that's the way
it looks in the pan and these are the
swatches on my fingers here's a hand
swatch now they don't look super super
pigmented but it's really nice because
they're very buildable one thing that's
really unique about these is that
they're very buildable so they start off
being relatively light but they're very
easy to build to the next level also
they're very easy to blend they're
mostly matt i would say the brow bone
one is matt the crease one is met the
lid and the outer corner ones have just
a tad bit of shimmer just in time as
Tiny's a little bit thanks for a
beautiful
look using these for the specific things
that it says here i am in love with this
palette so happy with it the next thing
I got I figured since I was getting it I
would get another eyeshadow brush
because I've never tried I shadow
brushes from Michael Marquez he said the
retail on the cargo pallet was thirty
four dollars so the retail price on the
micro Michael Marcus brush is twenty-six
dollars I do really like this brush I
don't know if it's worth twenty six
dollars but it is really nice one thing
I love about this let me show you I
don't know if you'll be able to see that
but the way that it's tapered its
tapered downward so the shortest
bristles come here and then it goes up
to the top and why I like that is
because the product hangs on to the tips
of the bristles so when you're trying to
get a color to stick to the brush it's
really nice when it's tapered down that
low so that it picks up lots of Prague
it's also very very soft I haven't seen
any shedding yet the ferrule looks like
it's on there very nicely and just
really happy with this brush overall
next I got some threader earrings I am
wearing the gold ones today the way
these things work is you know I know
it's really creepy how they work you see
if I can get them out you see how
they're like that and there's like a
little chain here that's the part that
goes in your ear that like hangs in your
ear and then you just kind of feed it
through your ear and I absolutely love
the way these things look and I never I
never get them except for when i add
them to the bag now they were having
like a serious serious sale so i got a
ton of stuff added to the bag without
having to spend a lot of my credit and
this was one of the things that I got
these were retailed $35 and i want to
say they were only like ten dollars to
add to the bag so i got two pairs of
these i got the gold and then i got a
rose gold pair i also got these threader
earrings oh and the retail on those
threader earrings are think $35 yeah
thirty-five dollars apiece i also got
these threader earrings and i am
actually not happy with these i had
gotten ones that were like this before
and they did fall out of my ears I lost
one of each pair that I had I had a gold
parents they'll repair and I lost both
so I thought I would try them again
because they have this little thing
that's supposed to prevent them from
falling out of your ear but the problem
is is this is so big it doesn't
fit in my ear so I cannot get these into
my ears if you have if you're used to
wearing very heavy earrings if your
holes are big you will probably be fine
with these I am not used to wearing
heavy earrings so therefore these did
not work for me unfortunately one of the
negatives of little black bag because it
is quite a pain to send things back so i
don't typically send things back to them
i try really hard to make sure that i
have things i really like so that i
don't have to worry about sending the
back it's expensive to send them back
and then the credit system is just
little yeah and again those are $35
retail for those i also got these robert
rose earrings and these were not getting
any love on the site and I can see why
because you know they're very big I did
wear these out one night and I got a ton
of compliments on them the retail price
on these is twenty dollars and I do feel
like it is worth the twenty dollars they
are very heavy though so if you don't
like heavy earrings these will not be
for you the next thing that I got was
this necklace and this actually ooh it
looks pretty cheap but at the same time
it really does look cute on and this is
by this is by Lolita and I typically
like Lolita jewelry and I just really I
think it looks really cute on even
though the gold looks a bit cheap to me
all the little pearls are in and then
it's got these little rhinestones down
the center and I'm really enjoying
wearing that and this was called the
studded bow pendant it's two more things
that I got in that order I believe I
believe a believably okay so the last
two things that I got are these two
bracelets by on earth by to hell in a
handbag and thats the live laugh love
Tron bracelet and then the other one is
I believe the infinity charm bracelet
and I forgot the names of the stones
that please excuse the kids chatter in
the background my husbands watching them
but I can't keep them silent so they're
both they both are made with real stones
which I love I I don't know I probably
never mentioned this is a video before
but i absolutely love rocks i think
rocks are just really fun and cool just
because they're made in nature and
they're old like I just think and
they're colorful and need and they're
all made different ways and they have
different minerals in them and I just
think they're cool so I love that
they're real stones this I'm not real
sure if I really like this
live laugh love charm I think it's a
little bit cheesy but I do like the
little infinity one there I may end up
taking this off and just wearing it as
just the pink stones but really really
loving these and enjoying these are
really fun with just a t-shirt and
Jeannie even after getting all of that I
still had quite a bit of credit left so
I went nuts again and went shot me again
and I got a ton of jewelry and I got
three pairs of shoes and I'm telling you
even when you don't have credit little
black bag has been going nuts with their
sales they have like flash sales on
certain brands or on jewelry with us a
ten-dollar shoes or they'll say five
dollar jewelry or I mean they're just
been going crazy lately with their sales
so I've been able to get a lot of stuff
this bag that I opened I actually opened
with this purse and this is why I vonca
Trump yes mr. Trump his daughter and the
retail price on this is one hundred
fifty dollars and I don't know how much
they were charging for the site but I
know it wasn't a hundred fifty dollars i
want to say it was maybe 60 and i love
this person i have not carried it yet
because i was scared was going to get
dirty before i could show it to you so i
wanted to show you that it's got this
really cute very easy to open and close
front closure the gold detailing is
beautiful look inside it's got the gold
inside it's kind of a bronze gold mono
bronze it's gold inside its got the back
pocket here the zipper actually let me
show you this I don't know if you can
see in there if it's bright enough but
the zipper here actually already fell
off and i haven't even used it once this
came open and the zipper part fell off I
think it's in here somewhere yep here it
is this is what it had looked like and
it came off I can probably repair that
it's not that big of a deal but the
zipper seems like it's pretty good
quality it's just that the little tag
fell off so it's got a pocket back here
thick thin pocket there it's got two
pockets two pockets there it's got the
zipper there and then it's got a pocket
back in the back no pocket back here so
I mean it is really cute the inside does
feel very crunchy a little bit cheap
which surprised me from my vonca Trump
that she would put out something that
feels like that on the inside but you
know I mean they're trying to
manufacture a bunch of handbags I'm
trying to make some profits so
is not adjustable the strap I do like it
though and I do think it's a really cute
purse it's just I don't think that it's
worth the retail price of what was at
one hundred and fifty dollars I would
never pay a hundred fifty dollars for
this I would say this is worth maybe
fifty or sixty dollars i would i think
that people would pay for that in the
store maybe 50 it is itson kids a cute
bag and i like it a lot it's just not
$150 cute let me show you the shoes this
one is by pink pepper and I wore these
to a rehearsal not rehearsal I wore it
to a wedding reception last night and I
got compliments on them they're super
cute just you know these these cork
wedges and they're very cute I like them
a lot okay these are called the Cindy
wedge and the retail on these is $59 and
they're very comfy and cute they fit
nicely these are other ones I added
these two bag I think for like ten
dollars and these are the mia girl
brandy flats and they are really really
cute they fit me nicely as well loving
those and then the last pair of shoes
they actually sent me the wrong shoes
this one is I ordered the delray sandals
and they sent me the dell something else
sandals I don't really care for this
style but I am gonna keep them and wear
them even though i don't really like
them I did contact them and tell them
they sent me the wrong style but I
haven't heard anything back I mean I did
get them for free so I'm not going to
complain about it yeah these are the Del
Mar sandals if I had paid for these I
would have been upset if I had to return
these and and hopefully I think that
they do pay the return shipping if they
make a mistake but yeah that was not so
cool that they did that but you know it
is what it is the Delray sandals were
much much much cuter then I got a bunch
of jewelry as well these were getting
like no love on the site these are by
Katherine Stein and they're the
butterfly earring and I just absolutely
love those I love the it almost looks
like a lace here it's just really really
pretty and the little tiny stones I
didn't realize there were little tiny
stones in there they're just really cute
and the backs there i'm not a big fan of
these circle backs but i always break
those all and the retail price on the
butterfly earrings is twelve dollars and
I definitely feel like these are worth
twelve dollars I did get the Stefan and
company bar pendant necklace retail
price on this was twenty four dollars
and I got compliments on this as well
this is one that is like so ugly that I
think it's cute I really like this I
mean I know it's it's a little it's a
Lou I don't know it gets just a little
edgy but it's got like the diamonds and
the bars and I don't know I like it
nobody was trying to trade me for it uh
you know but I I really think it looks
nice with the right kind of outfit you
know like a white shirt or you know a
black shirt something that's a little
more edgy really like that next we got I
got the geranium earrings I actually got
these in white as well but these are the
pink ones and those are just cutie
little bows basic cute good quality tail
price on those is $22 I do feel that's
quite overpriced for those next I got
this necklace by Jarden now these are
not real stones but I do really like
them a lot and this is the large stone
cord necklace retail price thirty
dollars and I really like this even
though it's not real I think it's cute
um you know goes with this outfit and
then all the rage earrings I lost a
little the little paper that these were
on but i'll show you these are really
cute and these are called the gist
flower earrings and they had black ones
and white ones and i just really like
those a lot i think they're super cute
they're very springy and fun these are
so cute oh this is one of my favorite
things that I got these are adorable I
added these to my bag and I am so
thankful they are so keys are called the
bird flower earrings and they had these
in white and in blue but look at the
detailing on there just really adorable
every time I wear these I get
compliments just so stinking cute and
the retail price on those is $34 i would
say these are definitely at least twenty
dollar earrings they're really cute i
don't know about 34 but twenty dollars i
would definitely pay for that next i
have not worn this because i do not like
it i think it looks really cheap it is
the Catherine Stein designs and it is
called the beaded bracelet set and they
haven't been separated yet I just feel
like this looks like children's jewelry
it just looks cheap
I'm just not happy with this at all I
don't know it just looks really super
cheap to me i'm not a fan of that and
then the robert rose stone bracelet i
really like this one a lot this one's
really pretty it does look a little bit
cheap but i'm happy with it the oh by
the way the catherine sign designs
beaded bracelets that was retail $22
this was retail $24 I could see paying
15 bucks for this it's cute but it's not
all that it's okay but I have worn this
and I do like it so they also did not
send me the Lydell NYC stone bracelet I
really wanted that I didn't get it and
that's okay I'll be all right but I am
sad I didn't get it and I did get this
Jarden semi-precious bracelet this is
really really cute and I love this
because this is real rose quartz and I
forget the name of this stone but I'll
you know like i was saying i love real
stones and this is just adorable and I
have gotten quite a few compliments on
this piece as well so that's it for my
little black bag ginormous haul I do
still have a little bit of credit left
I've got about forty dollars worth of
credit left even after getting all of
this that just goes to show how
inexpensive a lot of these items are on
the site so definitely go check it out
if you're in the market for some new
jewelry I do feel like some of their
products are hit or miss I don't like
their return the way that they do
returns but it is a lot of fun to trade
on little black bag and I at one point I
said I wasn't going to do it anymore
just because I felt that the quality was
going down and I don't want the return
policy but I this this kind of
re-energized me and I like about
eighty-five ninety percent of the stuff
that I got so i think i will be ordering
from them again even after my credit
runs out so i hope you enjoyed this
video if you did make sure you give it a
thumbs up and makes you subscribe if
this is the first video you're seeing of
mine thank you so much for watching mad
love my friends and i'll see you soon
