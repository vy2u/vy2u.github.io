massive little black bag haul for you if
you've never heard of a little black bag
little black bag is a really fun website
that can be very addicting
but there are some positives and
negatives that I will get into as I go
through this video basically what you do
is you pick out your item than giving
your mystery stuff and then you get a
chance to trade your items with other
users for us for seven days hello to my
friend who has a channel called little
black bag addict I was thinking about
you when I go is getting all of this
stuff together and I hope you really
enjoy this video let me just get into
what happened and how I ended up with so
much stuff so my first bag that I opened
up I got this bag here but I Elise hope
it's like a croc look in print this bag
is the croc hobo and I had my eye on
this for a really long time it been on
the site forever and I just really
wanted it so I finally broke down and
got it the retail price on this bag is
$90 all the things I got in that order
cost me about $65 so this here and then
I also got these earrings these are by
Katherine Stein designs and they're just
some really cute little stud earrings
and the retail price on these was $16 I
do feel like that's a little overpriced
for how I feel like these are kind of
not that they're cheap looking they just
don't look there's not real nice I don't
know I guess they're about right $16 so
one thing I want to show you about the
bag is that frustrating is it does come
with one of these dust bags it is very
thin but you know it's a nice dust bag
to do with these home and then let me
show you the inside it does not come
with an extended shoulder strap but that
is the prints on the inside so you've
got the zipper in the back and then
you've got pockets in the front here
they're just it's two pockets a bigger
one and a smaller one one thing I think
is kind of strange as it's got this
plate here but there's nothing on it
it's just blank which i think is kind of
odd but it's not distracting like on the
way it feels inside it feels like a
satin let's just look at look up maybe
like a satin scarf you may get it Target
or something it doesn't feel
anything spectacular but it doesn't feel
super cheap either it is relatively thin
I would imagine this would rip after
maybe about a year's worth of solid wear
this would probably rip on the inside
the zipper feels really good I do like
that it dips closed in the top I'm
always dropping things out of my bag so
I love bags zip in the top the hardware
is silver it does have a zipper here on
the back it has the same print on the
inside and overall I am really really
happy with this bag all right the next
thing I got in that order was this
bracelet and this is by this is by Carol
Joe plays and it is called the round
opal stretch bracelet and it does
stretch so that's how the stones look
you can see that you've got the two
stones here and then the larger stone
here this is not real opal and it's just
a really cute just basic bracelet on the
inside the elastic is clear I don't know
if you can see that there and I really
like this bracelet it's super cute the
last thing that I got in this order
which I'm really happy with and I don't
have the packaging anymore is this
Kenneth Cole watch I needed a watch I
actually got no watch on Groupon and it
came broken but I took a while to try to
replace the battery see if I could fix
it and by the time I replaced the
battery I could not return it and I was
really upset about that so I needed a
new watch and this is the Kenneth Cole
New York snakeskin watch and it's just
really pretty it's very well made
nothing too fancy but just really cute
the retail price on the bracelet was $24
and the retail price on the watch was
mimimi
$95.00 so yeah so I was really happy for
$65 to get both the purse and the brace
and the watch and the earrings and the
bracelet and there was actually
something that I had ordered I had just
gotten some subscription box that had a
blush from Pandora's makeup box and I
was really excited I really liked the
blush so I want to try some of their
eyeshadows why I had ordered this very
cool eyes shadow palette kind of see if
you can see on my phone so I got this I
traded for that and then look like
little black bag is relatively good
about getting things to you quickly so I
guess it was maybe a day or two later I
got this email and it says we hope you
are well unfortunately we were not able
to process your order fully due to a
warehouse error report regarding the
Pandora's makeup box very cool eyes
shadow palette $48 retail we're so sorry
about this because this happened during
our warehouse guarantee we have added 10
times the add to bag price of twenty
seven dollars which is 270 dollars in
merchandise credit on your account and I
went like I cannot I couldn't believe it
was real two hundred and seventy dollars
in Versailles credit so immediately I
put it on my Instagram like you have got
to be kidding me
so everything else that I'm about to
show you I got completely free now I
would have been happy with two times the
retail price like I'm not gonna complain
that they gave me ten times but I just
think that's a little excessive like I
don't want to see them go out of
business over something like that like
it's just craziness so I'm not gonna
complain but at the same time I think
that was a bit excessive the ten times
the amount and I did spend it now I
don't know if it's because they know I
make videos I've never spoken with any
representatives of lip from a little
black bag personally so I don't I don't
know but I do know that every time I
upload a little black bag video it does
go directly to their site so maybe they
know that I'm gonna show all their stuff
and that's why they gave me ten times I
don't know but I did get some stuff and
I do want to show it to you so going
into my second order I'm not getting the
eyeshadow that I wanted I ended up
getting this cargo eyeshadow quad in my
second order and this is amazing
love-love-love this eyeshadow quad let
me show you so that's the way it looks
in the pan and these are the swatches on
my fingers here's a hand swatch now they
don't look super super pigmented but
it's really nice because they're very
buildable one thing that's really unique
about these is that they're very
buildable so they start off being
relatively light but they're very easy
to build to the next level also they're
very easy to blend they're mostly matte
I would say the brow bone one is matte
the crease one is matte the lid and the
outer corner ones have just a tad bit of
shimmer but just the tiniest tiniest
little bit makes for a beautiful eye
look using these for the specific things
that it says here I'm in love with this
palette so happy with it the next thing
I got I figured since I was getting it I
would get another eye shadow brush
because I've never tried i shadow
brushes from Michael marques so the
retail on the cargo palette was 34
dollars so the retail price on the
Michael Michael Marcus brush is $26 I do
really like this brush I don't know if
it's worth $26 but it is really nice one
thing I love about this let me show you
I don't know if you'll be able to see
that but the way that it's tapered it's
tapered downward so the shortest
bristles come here and then it goes up
to the top and why I like that is
because the product hangs onto the tips
of the bristles so when you're trying to
get a color to stick to the brush it's
really nice when it's tapered down that
low so that it picks up lots of product
it's also very very soft I haven't seen
any shedding yet the ferrule looks like
it's on there very nicely and just
really happy with this brush overall
next I got some threader earrings I am
wearing the gold ones today the way
these things work is you know I know
it's really creepy how they work let me
see if I can get them out you see how
they're like that and there's like a
little chain here that's the part that
goes in your ear
they're like hangs in your ear and then
you just kind of feed it through your
ear and I absolutely love the way these
things look and I never I never get them
except for when I add them to the bag
now they were having like a serious
serious sale so I got a ton of stuff
added to the bag without having to spend
a lot of my credit and this was one of
the things that I got these were
retailed thirty-five dollars and I want
to say they were only like ten dollars
to add to the bag so I got two pair
these I got the gold and then I got a
rose gold pair I also got these threader
earrings oh and the retail on those
threader earrings are think $35 yeah $35
apiece I also got these threader
earrings and I am actually not happy
with these I had gotten ones that were
like this before and they did fall out
of my ears I lost one of each pair that
I had I had a gold pair and silver pair
and I lost both so I thought I would try
them again because they have this little
thing that's supposed to prevent them
from falling out of your ear but the
problem is is this is so big it does not
fit in my ear so I cannot get these into
my ears if you have if you're used to
wearing very heavy earrings if your
holes are big you will probably be fine
with these I am not used to wearing
heavy earrings so therefore these did
not work for me unfortunately one of the
negatives of little black bag because it
is quite a pain to send things back so I
don't typically send things back to them
I try really hard to make sure that I
have things I really like so that I
don't have to worry about sending them
back it's expensive to send them back
and then the credit system is just yeah
and again those are $35 retail for those
I also got these Robert Rose earrings
and these were not getting any love on
the site and I can see why because you
know they're very big I did wear these
out one night and I got a ton of
compliments on them the retail price on
these is $20 and I do feel like it is
worth the $20 they are very heavy though
so if you don't like heavy earrings
these will not be for you the next thing
that I got was this necklace and this
actually ooh it looks pretty cheap but
at the same time it really does look
cute on and this is by this is by Lolita
and I typically like Lolita jewelry and
I just really I think it looks really
cute on even though the gold looks a bit
cheap to me all the little pearls are in
and then it's got these little
rhinestones down the center and I'm
really enjoying wearing that and this
was called the studded bow pendant it's
two more things that I got in that order
I believe I believe I believe I believe
okay so the last two things that I got
are these two bracelets by on earth by
to hell in a handbag and that's the live
laugh love tron bracelet and then the
other one is I believe the Infinity Tron
bracelet
and I forgot the names of the stones
that please excuse the kids chatter in
the background my husband's watching
them but I can't keep them silence so
they're both there they both are made
with real stones which I love I I don't
know I probably never mentioned this in
the video before but I absolutely love
rocks I think rocks are just really fun
and cool just because they're made in
nature and they're old like I just think
and they're colorful and mean and
they're all made different ways and they
have different minerals in them and I
just think they're cool so I love that
there are real stones this I'm not real
sure if I really like this little live
laugh love charm I think it's a little
bit cheesy but I do like the little
infinity one there I may end up taking
this off and just wearing it as just the
pink stones but but really really loving
these and enjoying these are really fun
with just a t-shirt and Geney even after
getting all of that I still had quite a
bit of credit left so I went nuts again
and went shot me again and I got a ton
of jewelry and I got three pairs of
shoes and I'm telling you even when you
don't have credit a little black bag
he's been going nuts with their sales
they have like flash sales on certain
brands or on jewelry will they'll say
$10 shoes or they'll say $5 jewelry or I
mean they're just been going crazy
lately with their sales so I've been
able to get a lot of stuff in this bag
that I opened I actually opened with
this purse and this is by Ivana Trump
yes mr. Trump his daughter and the
retail price on this is $150 and I don't
know how much they were charging for to
the site but I know it wasn't a hundred
fifty dollars I want to say it was maybe
60 and I love this person I have not
carried it yet because I was scared just
gonna get dirty before I could show it
to you so I wanted to show you that it's
got this really cute very easy to open
and close front closure the gold
detailing is beautiful look inside it's
got the gold inside it's kind of a
bronze gold mono bronze it's gold inside
it's got the back pocket here the zipper
actually let me show you this I don't
know if you can see in there if it's
bright enough but the zipper here
actually already fell off and I haven't
even used it once this came open and the
zipper part fell off I think it's in
here somewhere yeah here it is this is
what it had looks like and it came off I
can probably repair that it's not that
big of a deal but the zipper seems like
it's pretty good quality it's just that
the little
fell off so it's got a pocket back here
thick let then pocket there it's got two
pockets two pockets there it's got the
zipper there and then it's got a pocket
back in the back no pocket back here so
I mean it is really cute the inside does
feel very crunchy a little bit cheap
which surprised me from my funk of Trump
that she would put out something that
feels like that on the inside but you
know I mean they're trying to
manufacture a bunch of handbags they're
trying to make some profits so this is
not adjustable the strap I do like it
though and I do think it's a really cute
purse it's just I don't think that it's
worth the retail price of what was it
one hundred and fifty dollars I would
never pay a hundred and fifty dollars
for this I would say this is worth maybe
50 or 60 dollars I would I think that
people would pay for that in the store
maybe fifty it is a it's a it's a cute
bag and I like it a lot it's just not
$150 cute let me show you the shoes this
one is by pink pepper and I wore these
to a rehearsal not rehearsal I wore it
to a wedding reception last night and I
got compliments on them they're super
cute just you know these these cork
wedges and they're very cute I like them
a lot
okay these are called the Cindy wedge
and the retail on these is $59 and
they're very comfy and cute they fit
nicely these are other ones I added
these to bag I think for like $10 and
these are the mia girl Brandi flats and
they are really really cute they fit me
nicely as well loving those and then the
last pair of shoes they actually sent me
the wrong shoes this one is I ordered
the Del Ray sandals and they sent me the
del something else sandals I don't
really care for this style but I am
gonna keep them and wear them even
though I don't really like them I did
contact them and tell them they sent me
the wrong style but I haven't heard
anything back I mean I did get them for
free so I'm not gonna complain about it
yeah these are the Del Mar sandals if I
had paid for these I would have been
upset if I had to return these and and
hopefully I think that they do pay the
return shipping if they make a mistake
but yeah that was not so cool that they
did that but you know it is what it is
the Del Ray sandals were much much much
cuter then I got a bunch of jewelry as
well these were getting like no love on
the site these are by Katherine Stein
and at the butterfly earring and I just
absolutely love those I love the it
almost looks like a lace here it's just
really really pretty and the little tiny
stones I didn't realize there were
little tiny stones in there they're just
really cute and the backs there I'm not
gonna fan of these circle backs but I
can always break those almonds the
retail price on the butterfly earrings
is $12 and I definitely feel like these
are worth $12 I did get the Stephan and
company bar pendant necklace retail
price on this was $24 and I got
compliments on this as well this is one
that is like so ugly that I think it's
cute I really like this I mean I know
it's it's a little it's a little I don't
know like it's just a little edgy but
it's got like the diamonds and the bars
and I don't know I like it nobody was
trying to trade me for it you know but I
really think it looks nice with the
right kind of outfit you know like a
white shirt or you know a black shirt
something that's a little more edgy
really like that next we got I got the
geranium earrings I actually got these
in white as well but these are the pink
ones and those are just cutie little
bows basic cute good quality tail price
on those is $22 I do feel that's quite
overpriced for those next I got this
necklace by jardin now these are not
real stones but I do really like them a
lot and this is the large stone cord
necklace retail price $30 and I really
like this even though it's not real I
think it's cute you know goes with this
outfit and then all the rage earrings I
lost a little the little paper that
these were on but I'll show you these
are really cute and these are called the
just flower earrings and they had black
ones and white ones and I just really
liked those a lot I think they're super
cute they're very springy and fun these
are so cute oh this is one of my
favorite things that I got these are
adorable these I added these to my bag
and I am so thankful they are so cute
you're called the bird flower earrings
and they had these in white and in blue
but look at the detailing on they're
just really adorable every time I wear
these I get compliments just so stinkin
cute and the
tell price on those $34 I would say
these are definitely at least $20
earrings they're really cute I don't
know about 34 but $20 I would definitely
pay for that next I have not worn this
because I do not like it I think it
looks really cheap it is the Catherine
Stein designs and it is called the
beaded bracelet sets and they haven't
been separated yet I just feel like this
looks like children's jewelry it just
looks cheap I'm just not happy with this
oh I don't know it just looks really
super cheap to me I'm not a fan of that
and then the Robert Rose stone bracelet
I really like this one a lot this one's
really pretty it does look a little bit
cheap but I'm happy with it
the oh by the way the Catherine Stein
designs beaded bracelets that was
retailed $22 this was retailed $24 I can
see paying 15 bucks for this it's cute
but it's not all that it's okay but I
have worn this and I do like it
so they also did not send me the Lydell
NYC stone bracelet I really wanted that
I didn't get it and that's okay I'll be
alright but I am sad I didn't get it and
I did get this jardín semi-precious
bracelet this is really really cute and
I love this because this is real rose
quartz and I forget the name of this
stone but I'll you know like I was
saying I love real stones and this is
just adorable and I have gotten quite a
few compliments on this piece as well so
that's it for my little black bag
ginormous haul I do still have a little
bit of credit left I've got about 40
dollars worth of credit left even after
getting all of this and that just goes
to show how inexpensive a lot of these
items are on the site so definitely go
check it out if you're in the market for
some new jewelry I do feel like some of
their products are hit or miss I don't
like their return the way that they do
returns but it is a lot of fun to trade
on little black bag and I at one point I
said I wasn't going to do it anymore
just because I felt like the quality was
going down and I don't want the return
policy but I this this kind of
re-energized me and I like about 85 90
percent of the stuff that I got so I
think I will be ordering from them again
even after my credit runs out so I hope
