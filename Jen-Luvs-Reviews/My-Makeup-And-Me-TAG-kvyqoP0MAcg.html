literally the third time I've shot this
video the first time something was
happening with my focus and it was just
ugly the second time accidentally
deleted half the footage so I'm hoping
this will be the final time then I have
to shoot the my makeup and me tag now
this was a tag that I created for the
best in beauty competition I'm like
three weeks late on doing it myself but
I definitely want to do it cuz number
one I made it up and number two it's an
awesome dad you know if I might say so
myself I'm just gonna get right into it
and then if you decide you want to do my
makeup enemy tag that will make me so so
so so happy make sure that you put it as
a video response down below so that I
can watch it i have videos automatically
approved to be approved for video
responses so no matter when you put a
video as a video response it will be
automatically approved and unless it's
inappropriate i will let it stay there
the first question in this tag is when
did you become interested in makeup and
beauty products i became interested in
making my beauty products when i was
very young my mom sold Avon and she had
these little it was like a little
plastic container and add these days any
lipsticks in it my mom used to let me
play with them and i just had so much
singing fun with these things he had one
that she let me play with and then she
had ones that she would take over to
customer so that was my first experience
with makeup and I just loved it at what
age did I start wearing makeup regularly
I strong wearing mega bernoulli when I
was about 13 um I believe it or not in
elementary school I was like the dirty
kid who were ugly clothes and that is an
accurate representation of who I was I'm
not exaggerating um I just didn't I
didn't care about my appearance I had no
pride I just didn't care and then for my
birthday party my birthday's in June my
birthday party of the summer between
fifth and sixth grade a friend of mine
came over and she brushed my hair out
and she did my makeup and it was like
real this is what I look like like I can
look like this like that's just some
craziness so Evers after that I decided
that that was something I wanted to do I
didn't really wear makeup in sixth grade
though I kind of held off until 7th
grade and 7th grade I had a few older
friends and I wore eyeliner that was my
big thing with black eyeliner because I
was really into like the hair bands like
poison and guns and roses was a hair
band back then and stuff like that never
and even the boys wore makeup so of
course I had to wear makeup one make a
mistake that I used to make was bottom
eyeliner only just atrocious looking
looks horrible at least in my opinion I
don't enjoy the look of a bottom
eyeliner also and you can you can
actually look back into my old videos
and see evidence of this one because it
didn't learn until recently was just how
big how important it is to match your
foundation to your skin color um I'll
even put a video clip right there about
horrible in this one video it's a great
video except for the fact that my face
is different color than my neck I always
want to be a little tanner so you know
my face was like pinky-orange and my
neck was white and ok if I was going way
home from her for one month and I could
only bring one beauty product with me
and there were no beauty products
available for purchase at this location
what would I bring and I would bring my
pen eyeliner either my steel probably my
Stila stay all day on pen eyeliner
because it is my new faith and I just
feel like eyeliner really makes my eyes
just go wow so um yeah that's what I
would ring when and why did you start
your YouTube channel um I talked about
this sometimes I used to have a channel
called genoise 37 it's the channel is
still there from 2006 to 2009 and I
mostly just did that because I always
wanted to have my own TV station and now
Harvey on TV so now I got my own station
at my own YouTube channel and it was
mostly a vlogging channel and it was a
lot of fun and then I had kids and I ran
at a time and then I started this one
because vlogging has relatively no
audience at this point I'd pretty much
be talking to myself and that's just no
fun for me to talk to myself I want to
talk to people so i had to find some
kind of topic and and really the topic
that I love the most right now is makeup
I
uh my idol in the YouTube makeup world
is emilynoel83 I absolutely think that
she is one of the most amazing video
creators that ever existed and she's
really my inspiration for this channel
and that is part of the reason why i
create the channel is because I am an
emilynoel83 grouping do I have any
advice for anyone making YouTube videos
absolutely i have a ridiculous amount of
advice for you but I'll narrow it down
to the things that I think are most
important number one just be yourself
and love what you do enjoy what you do
have a plan for your videos decide what
you're going to talk about that talk
about it get in get out be done with it
people don't want to sit and hear people
ramble on about everything forever
people want to hear that so just get to
the point and get out also don't stress
out about the numbers Cassie said this
in her video thrifted i'll put her video
down below that's like you gotta stop
with the numbers girlfriend you make
good video is that the people will come
you know they will find you when they
will come I am going to be doing another
more in the series of the truth about
making whatever and being a beauty guru
I want to do the truth about subscribers
and being a beauty guru I want to do of
the truth about about how to make more
money on YouTube and being a beauty guru
I want to add on to that series so I've
got some more of those coming up because
that video ended up being relatively
powder people seem to really like that
so I'm going to continue that series a
little bit coming up real soon of all
the videos I've ever made what is my
favorite and why the best in beauty
finale results show I must say I'm so
stinking proud of that video like I
worked so hard on that video and it's
funny because it's my favorite and i'm
not even at it i just edited all the
contestants videos together and I just I
just had so much fun doing it and it was
just a tribute to all the friends that I
made through the competition and I love
that video if I to pick ones that I was
actually in I would probably pick either
my daughter does my makeup or my makeup
don'ts video
which is pretty funny really my main
goal for my youtube channel is just to
keep doing what I'm doing which is just
having fun meeting people and enjoying
conversing with you all and learning
from you really I just want to present
products to you so that you don't waste
your money or that you know what the
best things are so that you can really
enjoy your makeup of buying experiences
instead of buying things and being like
