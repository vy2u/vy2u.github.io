repurchased beauty items video i got i
was contacted by a wonderful woman named
jenna who I just met on youtube Jen and
her friend Ellie were going to be doing
this collab together and they were so
kind to invite me to collaborate with
them I have said for a long time that
it's really not about how many
subscribers you have it's about the
quality of your channel and i can tell
you both jen and ellie both have i'm not
even kidding you quality channels and
it's so hard to get your name out there
for people to see your stuff I've always
said I try to only really shout out and
tell you to go see channels that I truly
believe are awesome and these are two
that I really truly recommend you it's
not because we're collabing it's because
i really think that they're great
channels i think that they're going to
go great places on youtube and i think
that you won't love them so without
further ado let me show you my most
repurchased products Ellie and Jen will
be showing you there's on their channel
i'm going to go ahead and link their
videos down below if I'm repurchasing
something that means that it was that
awesome that I felt like I could not
live without it let me show you the
first one the first one isn't going to
be a shocker and it is the Real
Techniques Beauty Blender ish thing I've
purchased this I think this is the third
one that I've purchasing but this is a
really great product i've also
repurchased the original Beauty Blender
it's just a really really nice way to
get a flawless look on your face and I
this thing's been talked about to death
I really do feel like this one is just
as good as the original and it is a
fraction of the price so highly
recommending this next thing is Urban
Decay primer potion I bought various
forms of this the anti-aging one this is
the first one that I've bought of this
but I've repurchased this brand this
type of product multiple times the
original this one and then I had one
called greed and just in general this is
a consistently excellent ice eyeshadow
primer keep shadows from fading and
creasing keeps them and makes them nice
and bright on your eyes just a really
fantastic product next up is one
I I think I showed this in one video but
these are essential for me these are the
love fresh nail polish remover acetone
free wipes I have a ton of these because
I use these for nail stamping and I
actually have a nail stamping video
coming up very very soon and I'm going
to show you how I use these for nail
stamping they're just great for cleaning
off the plate they're great in case I
make a mistake I can quickly wipe the
stamp off and then I just paint a coat
of polish and I just I don't have to
start over from scratch so and I just I
really can't imagine doing nail stamping
without these but i'll show you more
about that when i do the nail stamping
tutorial coming up in a few days a week
something like that it's coming up soon
I'm going to film it today so these are
awesome they're also good for just
taking off regular nail polish you can
take off all of your nail polish with
one of these if you push it I mean you
probably get off comfortably seven nails
but uncomfortably you can get all ten
off with one of these and they're pretty
reasonably priced and there's lots of
sales and little fresh website this also
shows up on hautelook sometimes so these
are awesome next up is the Tresemme
keratin smooth heat protectant I love
this stuff I feel like it works really
well protects my hair ever since i've
been using this i've seen a difference
in the shine of my hair also in the
minimal damage i do straighten my hair
quite often you can't tell from today
this is my natural curl but I just don't
I don't I every all the other ones that
I've used like this I don't like nearly
as much as this ivory purchased this I
think this is the third or fourth bottle
at bought of these so of this I
shouldn't say these of this and I love
it next up is the macadamia natural oil
deep repair masque I know this is kind
of hit or miss for different people this
is definitely hit for me I do have
normal very thin fine hair and it
moisturizes my hair it's just a
wonderful product it smells fantastic it
is a little bit pricey but it lasts
forever so I feel like it's worth it
this will last this lasts me about six
months and I use it once or twice a week
next up is the rapid lash this is
probably my sixth tube of rapid lash
before I started using this my eyelashes
were like teeny tiny little sparse
louses flashes now actually have lashes
and I credit it all to rapid latch this
does go on hautelook group on these also
if you have an Alta coupon back it'll
only the twenty percent off they can
only be used for non prestige items it
does work on this it is kind of pricey
it lasts three to four months but once
you stop using at your lashes do go back
to their normal length so you do have to
keep using it but I do keep using it and
I absolutely love this product it
definitely works in lengthening and
making my lashes fuller it's just it's
an amazing product love this next up is
the L'Oreal collagen moisture filler
moisturizer this is my winter
moisturizer I'm actually almost done
with us I'm trying to stretch it through
the rest of winter I feel like it's a
little heavy for my normal skin in the
summertime but it's fantastic when my
skin dries out a bit in the winter time
and I've this is the third time that I
bought one of these and I really really
like it has a nice smell I love it
especially in the morning because it has
it like crisp clean wake up smell and it
just feels great seeps in nicely
definitely for a normal to dry skin and
not for oily skin though haven't seen
really any anti-aging effects or
anything with it it's just a really nice
moisturizer next is the Rimmel stay
matte a long-lasting pressed powder this
is probably the third or fourth one of
these and you can see that I'm
definitely way in Japan on this but I
have so many powders i'm not going to
repurchase it anytime soon but when i
get a little bit more but i get in need
of another powder this will definitely
be repurchased i feel like this compares
to a lot of my high-end powders I don't
feel like it sits on top of my skin I
feel like it blends into my foundation
very very nicely this is the colored
Freeney natural that's the shade that I
am in and I love this especially for how
inexpensive it is I just it's an amazing
product is the best powder I've ever
used in my entire life absolutely not
but for a drugstore powder it is amazing
and what highly highly recommend it and
then the last thing is probably my
favorite favorite repurchase thing and
it's the Jessie's Girl liquid eyeliner I
got one of these at imats last year and
it changed my life I'm not even kidding
girlfriend and this thing changed my
life is this is what helped me to
finally do a functional wing and what
does it is the fine tip here
it that the tip is it's a brush believe
it or not it does have little bristles
but it goes to such a fine tip that the
line that it draws is absolutely
stinking amazing let me show you just
perfect I mean it draws the most perfect
line it's blackity black black black and
it is the most perfect eyeliner I have
ever used and it's by jesse's girl like
I said you can get these ads i want to
say walgreens is where they saw no maybe
CVS i'll put it down below i'm not sure
but i think it might be CVS where they
sell Jesse's girl I've never seen these
at CVS I mostly see the nail polishes
but we have a very very small selection
of Jesse scroll products at whatever
drug store it is that I get the mat and
you might be able to find this somewhere
you can also get them on the jesse
scroll website I do love the Jesse
scroll nail polishes as well the
eyeshadows I'm not very impressed with
so if you wanted to get more than just
one thing I would recommend the nail
polishes and the eyeliner from that
brand so so those are my most
repurchased products things that I
definitely cannot live without in my
life these are products that are just
tried and true for me personally I would
love to hear some of your favorite
products in the comments below and also
go ahead and check out my girls videos
if you want to see what their most
repurchase products are one thing I have
really appreciated and watching the
videos that I've watched of theirs is
that both of them are very articulate in
speaking about the products that they're
reviewing and also they give you good
valuable information and you don't
always get that in review you're not
