like I normally do I found my girl
Ashley and I said Ashley what you got
that's new
did that just rob that's really sad but
I swear I didn't do that on purpose
and Ashley was like you know what we got
everybody's freaking out over this new
bareMinerals fair skin pure brightening
serum foundation and I was like cool I
was like show me what it is she
explained it to me and I was like yes I
need to review that so she matched me to
my skin and matched the the foundation
of my skin and she found out that I was
bare shell at number two well big
problem was of course they were sold out
of that and she pretty much said that
that is the typical white girl shade and
she is african-american so it was quite
funny and I was like well you know what
am I gonna do she said well you know
even the bareMinerals store downstairs
in the mall doesn't have it like you can
check Sephora online so I went to
Sephora online and I ordered it and I
got it super fast I tried it for the
past three days basically what the deal
is with this is that you're supposed to
use more drops of this for fuller
coverage one drop for your whole face is
supposed to be like coverage and then
you work your way up to like five or six
drops or whatever eight drops something
like that for full coverage I'll put all
the information from the bare minerals
website down below I read in a comment
under Nicole Guerrero's video I didn't
actually watch Nicole Guerrero's video
because it was having some kind of error
because they didn't have Wi-Fi that's a
long story but I read a comment that she
was told to put one drop of this per
quadrant of her face from the
bareMinerals person that sold it to her
so I'm going to do that the other thing
I'm gonna do is I'm going to use an
airbrush for this side of my face and
I'm going to use my fingers for in this
side of the face so we can see whether
this 20-some dollar brush is actually
doing anything and whether it's worth
your money let me show you what the
brush looks I don't know if you can see
there we go so you can see that the
brush has this little circle cut out of
the middle and that's where you're
supposed to drip the foundation so I did
just find the box and I want to just
tell you the big things that this
company claims they say that it's
formulated without
oil silicone parabens or fragrance which
of course all of that is good I've never
heard that a foundation without water is
a good thing but I guess according to
bare minerals it is it's ultra thin
fluid seamless adjustable coverage
natural finish look of fair skin more
your skin is brighter more youthful
appearance bare minimum of ingredients
all of those good things like nothing
you've ever felt before I already know
what I think of it but I'll tell you
that after I show you how it applies
which I'm gonna show you right now
okay so final thoughts on this
bareMinerals a bearskin up pure
brightening serum foundation so I'm not
sure if you guys saw a difference but I
don't think I saw a difference between
the application of the brush and my
fingers except for that I feel like my
fingers gave them more full coverage
look with the amount of foundation that
I put on which for obvious reasons this
brush is going to absorb some product so
there is gonna be some product that's
gonna stay in here with your fingers
there is much much less absorption so I
feel like that you know is this brush
worth it to me no it's not worth it I
don't feel like it made a huge
difference in the way that it looks on
my skin I feel like maybe if you're
looking really close up you might be
able to tell and if you're one of those
people that really notices those kinds
of things that maybe you would want to
invest in the brush but personally I
feel like the brush was not worth the
investment at all even though it does
feel very nice to use and it does work I
feel like my fingers did just as good of
a job if not better in that it created a
more full coverage look now as far as
the foundation in general again I have
worn this three days in a row and I can
tell you that does have really really
nice lasting power lasted all day long
did not look like it was breaking up on
my skin which really really bothers me
when my face looks all you know I'm just
broken up and you can just tell that my
foundation is just wearing down through
the day and this did not do that at all
I definitely saw some loss of product
don't get me wrong there was some loss
of product but it wore off very evenly
which is the big difference for me a
critique I have about this is that this
is a very hard plastic it you can't
squeeze it so when I first started using
it it was a bit difficult to get the
drop to come out another tip if you
decide to buy this is make sure you
shake it because if you don't shake it
your drops will come out very watery so
very very important to shake this you
know I mean overall I do feel like this
is a really nice foundation I like that
it's buildable I like that you do you
can do light coverage medium coverage
full coverage I have not built this up
yet to a really full coverage because I
do not enjoy that look I only enjoy up
to a
'i'm coverage but i'm sure you're gonna
be able to find a ton of reviews on this
on nicole says that she really enjoys a
full coverage foundation that's the only
part i was able to hear of her video for
it cut off on me so might want to go
check on her video for me this is a win
and i am very happy to have it if you're
interested in and this crazy lip that I
have on or the blush that I just put on
I have a review of those products coming
up next their products I got from the
born pretty store which is a believe a
Chinese company and it's makeup from
China so this stuff is really
interesting and I am looking forward to
reviewing that for you so make sure you
subscribe so you don't miss that thumbs
up this video if you enjoyed it it makes
me look super ultra cool and thank you
so much for watching and mad love and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
