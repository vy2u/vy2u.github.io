the three new hard candy eyeshadow
palettes I got these at Walmart today
along with a couple of other palettes I
also got the blush nudes by Maybelline
and I got the Loreal appellate 1 nude
and the lafalot 2 nude on the palette
nude one and mobile at new to however
you want to say it this is the review
however of the hard candy palettes these
two I'm gonna do a review of this one in
a different video and these two in a
different video coming up very soon
makes you subscribe so you don't miss
those let's go ahead and get into these
the first one I'm going to be talking
about is the hard candy natural eyes
palette now what I did was I actually
filmed a video with every one of these
palettes and comparisons and the raw
footage was 40 minutes long so I've
decided to refill this video and just do
it in pieces so I have swamped these I
have used the eyeshadow primer that's in
here it was not dented when I first got
it but I didn't wanna let you know that
it did it I have swatch these so that's
why the eyeshadow primer looks a little
busted alright but you get 9 shadows in
this palette you get to a double sided
sponge tip applicator you get in the
eyeliner pencil you get in this little
pamphlet that has some I'll show you
this in a second it's got some looks in
it and it comes with a little mirror
it's also in a tint so if you're
traveling with it it should not be as
easily damaged if you're traveling and
it seems to shake a little bit in there
but it doesn't seem to be not secure
this base here is made out of plastic so
before we get into the eyeshadows let's
go ahead and swatch the eyeliner just so
you can see what that looks like okay
alright so let's watch the eyeliner boom
and first impression is that is
extremely creamy it looks like it's got
a nice texture to it it looks very
opaque very very black smudges oh my
goodness the smudge enos holy moly it's
a little it might be a little too smudgy
whew I'm a little nervous about that but
I am definitely willing to try it and I
will keep you posted on that
just to show you this is the little
pamphlet that comes with it it kind of
unfolds like this it says hello gorgeous
and that's
nice to see when you open something it's
got the shade tones here for you and
then three different looks they all have
a day look an evening look and then a
drama look which is even smokier than
the evening look so kind of like a like
a light medium and dark kind of look for
you oh and then on the other side they
have real eyes showing you what they
would look like on real eyes which is
kind of cool
so the primer here I did use this for
swatches in the last video that I shot
so you can see that it's kind of dented
I'm not confident there's a lot of
products in here that's looking sick
this is a sample of the Too Faced shadow
insurance this is a point put 1 7 ounce
and then this is also a point 1 7 ounce
so it's the same as a sample of shadow
insurance it just didn't seem to go very
far I don't know alright but anyway
let's show you what the primer looks
like and it is a kind of baiji skin tone
kind of color and when you swatch it it
feels very creamy and then it instantly
turns into a powder
okay it feels really good but there's no
coverage to it I don't believe I don't
believe there's it just is completely
transparent as soon as you rub it in so
I'm gonna go ahead and apply that to my
arm and I'll be right back ok I've
applied the primer to my arm and now I'm
going to swatch these for you on my arm
I'm just going to do finger swatches for
today and these I'm telling you are
super super creamy make sure my eyes are
right here so it's nice and focused one
two and three I mean all already you can
tell something magical is happening here
and this is 4 5 &amp;amp; 6 and this is 7 8 &amp;amp; 9
there you go
okay from swatching these honestly I
would tell you if I thought these were
terrible these are not terrible okay
these do not seem like drugstore shadows
to me I will tell you that right now
they seem extremely creamy the
pigmentation and the shimmer in them
remind me of high-end shadows I own a
lot of high-end shadows I'm not super
high-end like I own one one cabinet
kwon-do oh I've tried your shadows I
don't care for them but I have mostly
like Sephora brand high-end so like
two-faced Urban Decay you know NARS you
know those kinds of brands that they
sell Sephora that's kind of my thing
okay and I would compare these to those
shadows and I'm not exaggerating okay
especially like this one here and this
one here just absolutely gorgeous so if
you're wondering what's on my nails
these are scratch nail wraps I have a
video on these coming out very soon
they're supposed to be tiger print that
I look crazy for me but I'm trying to
roll with it alright this one here has
is a brown with a yellow sparkle I have
never seen anything like that in my life
it's very very interesting I'm really
looking forward to playing with that one
this I'm curious about this I think is
probably the weakest color that is this
one here that's the weakest for me I'm
curious to see how that's going to look
as far as a brow bone highlight inner
corner highlight something like that it
seems to be kind of the least pigmented
but it is so buttery I mean and the the
finger swatch like right on my finger
looks fabulous so I have a feeling
that's gonna be a great shade too as far
as mattes versus shimmers and sparkles
you are going to have what let's say
formats in here one two three and four
and I think was really smart of them to
do a like a medium and a dark and then
kind of an in-between over here and then
these are shimmers they're not satin so
to me Samiha satin is kind of a subdued
shimmer you've got glitter which is a
sparkliest then a shimmer and then a
satin and I would say these are shimmers
okay so if you have crepey lids these
movies might accentuate any kind of fine
lines or wrinkles that you have is
may not be for you these two here are
glitters okay
I'm curious to see how the fallouts
gonna be on those I don't see any
fallout initially so let's go ahead and
move on to the next pallet which is the
smokey eye palette so ivory primed my
hand and my arm and let's go ahead back
into the smokey eye one and this one is
gorgeous as well let's go ahead and show
you what the well you care about the
book I don't know if you care about the
book we'll show it to you real quick
just to show you what the looks look
like that are in here okay I'll just
show you the side what the eyeballs on
it so you can kind of see what they're
going for and again the the shade names
are here and then the directions here
for how to create those looks same deal
on the inside to get the shadow primer
you get the double end and spongy and
then you get the same liner and let's go
ahead and swatch the nine shades one two
and three wait so you see these weights
you see these bam bam bam no joke
okay so that is the entire pilot all
together and again extremely creamy so
what you're gonna have to do with this
one is look at those shades and see
whether they are calling to you or not
as far as the quality of the shadow is
the only one that I feel some grit to it
that I'm not happy with is this one down
here the swatch looks pretty nice but I
do feel some grit when I touch it which
makes me a little nervous that there's
going to be some fallout or that the
lasting power is not going to be good or
both
my favorite shadow is definitely this
purple one here it's got kind of it's
got kind of a duochrome
to it a little bit it's almost got like
two shades of purple like a pinky purple
and then like a lavender purple in there
I really like that one a lot
I'm also very impressed with this one as
well just really really like that shade
a lot this is gonna be for people that
are a little more adventurous when their
eye looks really going for some more
wild kind of look you're got a lot of
those whites in there but you've also
got these deeper shades that you can
really blend out and come out with a
really nice smoky look I think this is
extremely appropriately named the it's a
very versatile palette you only have two
mats here in this black and then this
deep like I don't know like a it's
almost like a denim blue like a very
deep blue and then the rest are well I
would say these these here are more
shimmer and then these are more satin
and then this is more of a satin but I
do see some very finely finely milled
glitters in here but they're barely
noticeable barely noticeable so if this
one speaks to you I would definitely
recommend this one as well let's go
ahead and move on to the last one which
is the sassy eye palette so this is the
way that this one looks inside I'll just
I'll show you the swatches and then we
will discuss okay so one two and three
and then the final ones okay so there
they all are for your viewing pleasure
okay this one I feel like is going to be
the hardest one to work with I feel like
this one when I look at it I'm trying to
think about looks that I would create
and I don't see complete looks in this
palette like I do with the other two I
just not that it's a bad palette I mean
if you're really good at finding color
combinations maybe you'll be better at
that I am but I'm like having trouble
finding like I don't I guess this would
be the crease color but it's like
where's I guess this might be a lid
color crease color and then you can
deepen it with one of these or you can
maybe use this as a lid color I don't
know and the other thing is is there I
feel like there needs to be like
something between this black and these
like medium kinds of colors there's no
like deeper brown or anything to kind of
work with it or even just the deeper
purple I don't know I guess that one's a
pretty deep purple I don't know I'm just
not as attracted to this one as I am the
other ones this one's very interesting
this peach shade with the the silver
sparkle is very interesting the other
thing about this is there's only one
matte shade which is going to make it
even more difficult to work with
compared to the others but there are
some really interesting shades in here
and if you have a big collection this
may be one that you want because you
might have shades in here that you just
don't have anywhere else such as this
black shade with yellow Glyn green and
orange glitters in it and this peach
shade with the silver glitters let me
show you again with the swatches I don't
know if you can see the sparkles in
there these two are going to be really
fun to play with this one reminds me of
something that we may have seen in The
Naked 3 palette these here are also very
interesting I'm not sure about this one
how that one's going to translate to the
eye but really I mean again just
extremely impressive Twitter and on
Instagram people have been saying that
these palettes are a lot like the Too
Faced palettes I have two Too Faced
palettes here
I have a natural at night and I have the
matte eye and what i did was i swatched
will see if you can tell the difference
ice two of these are from hard candy and
two of them are two-faced let's see if
you can set you can guess which one I'm
gonna give you a couple seconds to
decide so check those out again two of
those are from hard candy and two of
them are from two-faced this one is from
the hard candy palette and this is from
the Too Faced natural at night palette
this one is called night light all right
over here did you make your choice this
one is from the hard candy natural
palette and this one is chinchilla from
the Too Faced natural eye palette I mean
like seriously would you be able to tell
no I know I can't tell and even honestly
I thought that they the ones from the
hard candy palette swatched better
that's my opinion I'm not I can't make
this stuff up you can see it as well so
overall I mean have I said enough how
much I love these palettes I don't think
so let me just say it one more time I
love these palettes by the one that
calls to you that's my suggestion to you
they're nine dollars I got them at
Walmart I think they're exclusively only
at Walmart I think this the only place
you can buy hard candy you might be able
to buy it on a hard candy website
