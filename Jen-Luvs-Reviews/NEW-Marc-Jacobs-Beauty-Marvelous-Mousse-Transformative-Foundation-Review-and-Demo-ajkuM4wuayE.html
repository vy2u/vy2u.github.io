the new Marc Jacobs marvelous mousse
transformative foundation do I look
transformed do I look like a new woman
that's gonna lead inside the review here
okay so so this Marc Jacobs foundation
is $55 now I've got some definite
positives this foundation some definite
negatives to this foundation and at the
end you can decide for yourself whether
it is worth fifty five bucks to you okay
so let me tell you what this foundation
claims on the box here it says that it's
transformative it says that it's
lightweight it's full coverage and it's
luxurious it better be luxurious
luxurious for fifty five bucks right so
I am going to reach you from the Sephora
website what it says about this
foundation it says what it does reveal
skin's ideal complexion with this
nutrient rich full coverage foundation
that transforms from a lightweight
creamy mousse into a matte a
feather-light powder for a flawless
finish infused with high direct
hydrating ingredients like coconut water
and amino acids this formula derives its
velvety texture and transformative
properties from Mark's exclusive melt on
technology so the melt on technology is
an innovative blend of dynamic
ingredients including sweet orange
extract then enable the formula to glide
on smoothly melt on contact and
transform into a featherweight full
coverage powder and it's esse for is the
only place that you can buy this
foundation let's talk a little bit about
the deceptiveness of this marketing okay
first of all now I'm not saying on my
hating on it okay there's definitely
some positives I'll get to this in a
minute this is how it comes but let me
tell you when I think of a mousse I
think of like mousse all right a gross
how in the world is that a mousse
mark how's that a mousse you tell me how
this is a mousse this is crude it's like
cream it's it's cream it's it's a
foundation there's no she's not Mussina
Stu this at all it doesn't feel like the
mousse it doesn't look like a mousse and
I'm it doesn't feel like a mousse smell
like a mousse act like a mousse in a
mousse mark okay isn't
most so you know that's the first thing
that surprised me about it now the next
thing is in my opinion and you'll see in
the little demo you can decide for
yourself I don't think that this is full
coverage at all I feel like it's more of
a medium covered it is a really nice
medium coverage don't get me wrong I
love it but it's definitely not full
coverage at least for me I know there
are a lot of people out there that have
more skin problems than me and may get
this with the impression that's gonna be
full coverage and it's just not it let
me you know what let's just go ahead and
get into the demo and so you can see and
judge for yourself and and then we'll
talk about the rest of the view in a
minute so we'll jump into that demo
right now
when I began applying this foundation I
originally was using this Real
Techniques brush because I just didn't
want to invest in a Marc Jacobs brush
and there's a reason why you should not
be using this brush and it's because
when I use this brush it goes on
ridiculously streaky and maybe it's
because I'm used to using a beauty
sponge or a Beauty Blender or whatever
you want to call it because I use the
Real Techniques one but this just goes
on super stretchy streaky so I stopped
using this and started using my Beauty
Blender ish thing so I'm gonna use that
today to apply and you'll see how easy
it is to apply with that but I don't
know if the coverage would change if I
did use the Marc Jacobs brush so just
kind of keep that in mind as I apply so
as you can see it's very it's very very
solid it's definitely not a mousse
consistency and when I put my sponge in
it
I can push pretty hard and it just comes
off like normal okay and then so you can
see how the coverage looks I'm just
gonna kinda this is what I normally do
is it just kind of spread it around my
face just a little bit here a little bit
there move it down a little bit over
there and then I just kind of blend it
out
and again this might give more coverage
if I was actually using their brush and
I do tend to go over my lips I don't
know why have it from when I was younger
I don't know I guess it's just my
feeling that maybe it makes my lipstick
stay on longer I don't know so that's
how one coat of foundation looks I'm
gonna go ahead and show you how it looks
if I try to fill this so I'm gonna put
on a second coat ring my ring ring ring
and kind of try to build it up
and let's zoom in as you can see the
detail so the first thing you may notice
is that I need to get my eyebrows done
and that's the truth but we're not
talking about eyebrows today so I felt
like we were safe so you can see you can
still see my freckles most of my
darkness like my con my redness around
my eyes is gone you can see it's kind of
leached out my lips a little bit so
there you go that is the coverage I'm
gonna go and put some powder on so you
can see how that looks so I'm not used
to looking at my face like this and the
camera is kind of weird but I'm gonna
use my Mac mineralize skinfinish and
this is in medium and my it cosmetics
powder brush which is amazing but you
can see let me just put on the one side
so I only put the powder on the right
side of my face so you can see there
isn't a whole lot of difference as far
as how matte my skin is this is just a
little bit shinier but if you wanted to
do without a powder you could probably
get away with it I personally love to
use a powder cause I feel like it just
sets my foundation it makes it stay on
longer but you don't I mean it's not
that huge of a difference with the
powder with this foundation and just for
the fun of it we'll do the other side
we're not for the fun of it just to make
ourselves even ourselves like you're
doing it too just to make myself even
multiple personality disorder up in here
ourselves so that is the face and how
that turned out of course I look dead
right now cuz I've no color this is like
my blank sheet of paper so I'm gonna go
ahead and do the rest and I'll be right
ok so as you can see the claims on this
I don't know as far as the ingredients
of course I don't know if it has any you
know benefits for the skin one thing I
feel like a lot of companies do is they
they want to make you they make you want
to eat the products so to mention
coconut to mention orange you're like oh
I like to eat coconut eyelid coconut
flavored ice cream I will like coconut
in my foundation or I like to drink
orange juice in the morning I might like
orange in my foundation you know what
I'm saying I think it's a marketing
trick you know I don't know if it
actually has those properties but I'm
guessing that it that they don't really
do that but I don't know I'm not a
chemist so I mean that's just one thing
oh I forgot to mention I have this in
number 22 bisque light I didn't mention
that matches my skin tone perfectly I
absolutely love the skin tone the way
match my skin tone now let me tell you
another power
without this cuz I mean I've been hating
on it so let me tell you something
positive this stuff lasts on my skin
forever like I'm not even kidding like I
put this on eight o'clock in the morning
set well really 7:30 in the morning I'm
putting this on at you know 7 o'clock at
night I still have foundation on and
that is unheard of on my skin I don't
have oily skin I don't dry skin I'm
normal skin but I never have foundation
lasts all day long and this stuff lasts
all day long it's awesome in that way so
if you're looking for a long wearing
foundation you've got it here you're
looking for a full coverage foundation
you don't have it here if you're looking
for something to transform your face
into something else you don't have it
here as you can see in the demo it did
have a relatively matte finish but I
really really really like the way it
looks with the powder on I don't feel
like it gives me that powdered look that
I enjoy so that I'm not you know I'm not
I'm not falling for that one but if you
like that a little bit of a dewy finish
a little bit of that I don't know do we
finish if you like a little bit of that
look then you'll probably enjoy it
without a powder I just don't feel right
without a powder I don't know maybe it's
just you know being in a habit of using
a powder but I just feel like I need one
as far as the application now my Real
Techniques brush is very similar in
shape to the Marc Jacobs brush I'll put
a picture the Marc Jacobs brush right
there so you can see what it looks like
and I also put a picture of the Real
Techniques brush so you can really see
they're very similar looking brushes
aren't they the same I have no idea but
the Marc Jacobs brush is like 48 bucks
and I'm not that's just stupid
I'm just I'm not getting that especially
when I really do like the way my Beauty
Blender blending up under my Real
Techniques sponge really blends it out
nicely so you know that's just a
personal choice if you decide to
purchase this you may want to try to
purchase the brush but I'm just not
going to invest in that because I'm
happy with what I've got um overall I am
very happy with this foundation in that
it gives me a medium coverage that I
personally love I love a medium coverage
so that makes me happy I love that it
lasts so long do I feel like it's worth
fifty five dollars no I don't I feel
like this is worth maybe twenty-five or
thirty dollars as far as it's it's it's
just isn't it's nicer than my drugstore
foundations let's put it that way so I
would think that this should be
high-end product this should be
something you should have to invest more
in to get this kind of look but I don't
feel like it's a $55
no I'm saying overall this is a win for
me I am keeping it but price point is a
long time and high I don't think that it
lives up to a lot of the claims that it
claims to have I hope you enjoyed that
