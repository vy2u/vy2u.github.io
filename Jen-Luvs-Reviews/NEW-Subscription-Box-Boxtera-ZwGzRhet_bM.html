subscription box for you big shocker you
guys know how much I love my
subscription boxes and I company called
box Tara contacted me because I guess
they saw how many ridiculous number of
subscription boxes that i have and they
were like hey will you review our
subscription box and I was like yes I
will especially after I went to the
website and saw how much you get in each
box I was like wow so this one is very
different from let's say my Gray's box
which I love when you get four little
trays of snack for five dollars a box
now this one is a little bit more but
you get a lot more stuff in it so I was
curious to see whether there would be
similar to my grace box but more
full-size things in it so I'll show you
this is how it comes it did come in a
big package box everything was fedex and
this was the box that was inside now I
have not opened it I have no idea what's
inside so I'm really excited to open
this with you and i'm going to try
everything in here so that you guys know
whether it is delish or at least whether
i think is delicious or not by each
month you get five full-size handpick
snacks you can trust that your products
will be guilt-free so that you can feel
great about what you're eating no hot
fruit no HYFR cannot speak no high
fructose corn syrup no trans fats no
artificial sweeteners no artificial
flavors no artificial colors so pretty
excited about that and then it's got a
picture of what's inside but I don't
want to look at that cuz i wanna see
them actually in the bags so again oh
there's another thing it's got a recipe
that's so neat seared pork loin with
chipotle hibiscus barbecue sauce
feeching box Tara so that's kind of cool
little recipe inside and let's see the
first thing I'm seeing is I don't know
it doesn't say it's a little it's a bag
like this but it doesn't say what it is
oh I guess it says it on the card I
guess I'm gonna have to break down and
read the card it looks like this one is
tangerine slices how cool and it's a
sour so it looks like each one of these
is either salty bitter sour savory or
sweet so that's kind of cool
I'm so excited about these mm-hmm Wow
definitely getting the sweet and the
sour really really good I mean it's what
you would it's what you would imagine it
would be they've gotta chew to it it's
not like it's crispy in any way but it's
dry tangerines I've never tried to get
dry tangerines but if they're amazing
really really really good they say the
contents in here there is some added
sugar but that's it tangerine sugar
citric acid sulfur dioxide just for
preservative purposes really really good
these will be gone very very soon this
is hibiscus flower heads but I have
never seen this in a store before that's
another thing about some of these
subscription boxes it's not like you can
go in the store and be like by the way
do you have any hibiscus flower ettes I
mean you're not gonna find it it's just
it's so wonderful to be able to try
things I've never tried before look how
cool so neat can you guys see how cool
it is i don't know if you can see i got
a zuma since you guys can appreciate
this look at that isn't that neat at the
back almost looks like some kind of sea
urchin okay i'm almost a little bit
scared but it says that they're sweet
that's really good it's like um i'm
gonna taste like a fruit roll-up it
doesn't have a floral taste at all it
just it's like fruit roll-up my kids are
gonna love these things and again
hibiscus sugar and sulfide I oxide for
the preservative all right I'm gonna
finish it later because I got other
stuff to talk to y'all about can't stay
here forever and just eat hibiscus
flowers all day we got lots of things to
talk about I got three more bags of
snacks in here and they are all big huge
fan this is gigantic seven ounces I
think because it says one ounce and
seven bucks every sizes one ounce and
serving sizes seven per container okay
so this is a pub mix love me some pub
mix which of course you can find the
grocery store but this is more of a
natural version peanut sesame oil salt
wheat flour yeast honey garlic and
caraway powder that's it
nothing crazy sweet hmm give a
butteriness to them else is in here
these little sesame looking things I'm
not gonna have any room for my demo just
a really fun they're like little sesame
crunch things are really good and then
little bread sticky looking things I'm
gonna say that for another time i'm
assuming this is gonna be pretty typical
i'm seeing the other a little goodness
in here oh there's peanuts our stuff
down at the bottom there's like little
peanuts mmm really good really really
good these will be really good to put
out for you know having company over
this in a bowl be gone destroyed oh the
pug mix was considered salty these are
barbecue banana chips and these are for
savory are these babies you don't mind
me chewing on camera I hope not I'm just
trying to give you my impression I
apologize if you don't like me chewing
on camo I'm surprised bananas or savory
what's so interesting oh wow a little
bit spicy like that spicy sweet I'm a
spicy wimp lube is good my husband's
gonna love these my son is going along
these my two year old loves stuff like
this mmm this is a boy snack in my
opinion I feel like boys really like
that spicy stuff no more them women
girls do I don't know my off base on
that I get depends on culture too I
didn't grow up with a lot of spicy food
that is really good it's that spicy
sweet really good and honestly I'm
telling you honestly like I told them
specifically I was going to give an
honest review and there was no i'm not
going to deceive my subscribers at all
just because this was sent to me for
review does not mean i'm sure coding
this at all because you know they don't
have artificial sweeteners just kidding
um I'm calling cuz that was so spicy OH
but I promise you I'm not like just
saying this just because they said this
to me i'm truly enjoying me snacks like
the last time a little nervous about it
sesame
cut bukom bites and these are bitter and
I don't typically like bitter snacks a
little scared of these I have a feeling
I'm not going to like these they're
actually pretty good come on back stair
you're making me look like I'm just
lying here or yours only all this good
stuff it almost has like them like a
peanut buttery taste to it I definitely
wouldn't say it's bitter I mean the
aftertaste is a little bit bitter kind
of like I got peanut shell you know how
like when you get like the outside of a
peanut how it's got that little bit of a
bitterness to it that's kind of what
this tastes like so this one is peanut
sesame sugar flour salt cornstarch and
sesame oil that's the only ingredients
these are really good they have kind of
an Asian taste to it but they're really
good they're good I'm not gonna lie I'm
not just gonna lie just because it's got
sent to me I'm not gonna lie they're
good I feel like it's worth it these are
going to last my family a long time to
get through these I don't feel like this
is something that we would be able to
eat a monthly all of this stuff we don't
have enough people in our family we have
got you know my husband and me and my
two little kids but I mean just really
really good food this is going to be
really good to put these into the kids
lunches as like a healthy like side
little crunch you know you give them
like their little sandwich or their
little you know whatever their little
you know main dish is and then throw
this on the side instead of chips or
instead of you know whatever unhealthy
thing you normally put in I'm putting
these in is such a better option and
gives the kids energy for the day like
I'm such a proponent of healthy food for
kids and this is just really really good
