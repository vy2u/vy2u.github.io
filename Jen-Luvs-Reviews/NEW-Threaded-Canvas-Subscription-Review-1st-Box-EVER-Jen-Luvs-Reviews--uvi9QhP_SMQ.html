canvas this is our first threaded canvas
subscription box opening the wonderful
people over at threaded canvas they sent
this to us for review so I'm really
excited to show it to you got a hair my
lip oh yes and John's excited too so I
brought the kids with me because they do
include in threaded canvas three
t-shirts and they included one for me
one for my husband John and one for Lila
so I figured we would put Lila in the
video then of course I got Lila in the
video output John in the video so now we
end up with this little mommy children
video so a little bit about the threaded
canvas threaded canvas is twenty dollars
a month to get three t-shirts you also
get an art print and then you also get a
little extra hi they're all designed by
just smaller artists which which i think
is a really really cool my husband being
an artist i just love supporting you
know it's just growing artists this is a
really cool subscription in order to do
that and i love that you get three
shirts and it's only twenty bucks so
let's go ahead and get into the box
opening the kids are just they're being
kids that's just what happens let's see
what we got so we got the july box and
that's how it looks on the inside says
congratulations you're now in possession
of the inaugural first official threaded
canvas box the constant of this box have
been lovingly crafted from conception to
production every creation was
individually conceptualized and designed
by an independent artist and hand
printed by your very own threaded canvas
team very cool i also noticed on their
website that they do do upgrades where
you can get v-neck shirts you can also
get tank tops it costs a little bit more
for that when you purchase items from
the store including a mix match box
artists receive an industry-leading five
dollar commission per sale which is
really really cool so out of the twenty
dollars you pay you get the artist gets
five dollars that's really cool thank
you okay so let's see what we got so the
first one i'm seeing is a blue shirt and
let's see who this belongs to Lila who
do you think this one belongs to you
think this is going to be a daddy shirt
oh wow look at that
I think this is a daddy shirt hey let's
let's not do that yet okay all right so
this one is a size large this is for my
husband John and it looks like it is a
coffin but it's got a sailboat inside
the coffin inside the moon there's a
little skull it from the sailboat
there's an anchor kind of pulling it
down so I don't know what the symbolism
is for this but it's really cool what do
you think of that one you like that why
would you like that one John one this
one is youth youth medium so they gave a
huge shirt for a lot I think this one's
supposed to be for Lila it's this youth
medium supposed to be a you small so
what in the world is that I don't even
know what that is what is that ain't no
I don't know what that is Lila doesn't
look too happy about this one it gets a
banana peel with a crown on it ramp and
the style of it I don't know it's very
confusing like I don't know oh I
appreciate it looks like a piece of
candy okay they're very excited about
the candy not right now why because I'm
trying to shoot a video we have enough
they got off the menu maybe yeah okay so
uh it's very i don't know i don't quite
get the art I think that you know it's
cool to have art on a shirt but if you
as a person wearing it don't get the art
then you know I don't know that when I'm
not as big of a fan of Lila not a big
fan of that one now okay let's see what
this one is this one's probably mine yep
this one's mine see this one would you
wear this one if it was your size ya see
this one's super cool this is a tiger
and it's like a shattered Tiger this
one's really cool i like this one this
one is mine I like that one a lot i like
the textures we'll see what the other
stuff in here is and maybe you'll like
some of the other stuff okay alright so
this one is definitely a win for me okay
i don't know when exactly i'll wear it
but okay Mabel to be like a nighttime
shirt or just going out casual alright
so this is the art print we got look at
that that's really cool John do you like
this well why do you like that because I
make it oh look at colors yeah actually
that's what makes it really cool because
of all the with all the break hmm the
prince is definitely a win that's really
cool put this in a frame put it in your
room yeah I know you're trying to look
at yourself in the monitor right why
don't you look into the camera instead
that's where all of our friends are our
friends are right there hmm they're not
right there that's us that's the friends
okay next up oh this might be look at
that that's really cool that's a cute is
it a sticker maybe that can be for John
since you're gonna keep you out of the
cool art print yeah bear balloon crown
he's got two sets eyeballs maybe he's
like shaking so his eyeballs are like
vibrating or something I don't know
what's happening there and he's got a
tube going into his upside down shaped
heart which is very interesting and it
looks like the balloon string is kind of
wrapped all around him and he definitely
doesn't look very happy okay next I see
it's just a piece of cloth and it has a
person shaped figure it looks like a
ninja on this piece of cloth very
interesting rainbow pattern mmm yeah
okay and then the last thing in here is
a button so there is the cool nifty
button it looks like it's an astronaut
cat he's got splatter paint all over him
and that's very interesting and unique
and also we got a little candy a Mamba
lemon flavored Mamba candy these things
are amazing i have to somehow split it
between my two children so they both can
share it but that's kind of cool too so
overall in threaded canvas for twenty
dollars per month we got the three
shirts so we got the banana peel shirt
we got the tiger shirt I love time you
do you like that one I think that's my
favorite too and then we got the coffin
shirt with the boat in it we also got
the early nifty neato we got the candy
that's right we did get the candy we
also got the nifty neato jellyfish print
and we got these two
her and we got the piece of cloth with
the ninja on it I think this is one of
those things is you just kind of have to
look at it and see whether this is
something that you would be interested
in for yourself I know he's very excited
to funk the candy um but yeah I mean
yeah I just kinda have to look at and
this is their first box so kind of keep
that in mind so I mean curious to see
how their subscription is going to grow
over time how different artists will
find them and you know it should be
interesting to see what happens with
threaded canvas I'm excited about it
though so we'll see what happens Milo
what do you think about Freddie canvas
what was your favorite thing that we got
okay so you like the jellyfish print the
best cool cool John what was your
favorite thing in the box hey you like
