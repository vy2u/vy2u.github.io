the K where we test out Korean beauty
products to decide whether their with
your time and money we have a little
change of plans we're going to review
one thing but we got to go to plan B so
today we're going to be talking about
this new knee snowflake whipping
cleanser and we're going to use it with
this crazy thing which is called the
marshmallow whip maker so y'all ready to
get wet very very fast story before I
get into the details about this product
I was I told you last week that I was
going to be reviewing this this BB cream
I actually did review this today I did
an all-day wear test with the Born This
Way Foundation I do have one on one side
of my face and one on the other side of
my face can you tell it's been 11 hours
since I put it on can you tell what's on
what side yeah I had a microphone fail
where my microphone is missing the
casing for the battery so I actually
have it like all like MacGyver it up
with some tape holding the battery in
but sometimes the tape gets weak and my
battery fell out while I was in the
middle of filming this morning so I
can't redo it because that was part of B
for the wear test it was like the
information I gave you before the wear
test it was like talking about how my
face looks and everything there was no
way to salvage it so we're going for
Plan B and we're going to be reviewing
this next week so this week we're going
to change direction and we're going to
clean off what I did today with this and
I'm very excited about this product oh
by the way update on the giveaway from
last week is going to be at the end of
the video along with the information
about the lip maps that I tried last
week okay so this is the nuni snowflake
gripping cleanser it's 150 milliliters
they say that it's for all skin types I
got for $12 on Amazon it was free
shipping with Amazon Prime this is a
mini box product if you don't know mini
box it used to be a subscription service
not a subscription service but it was
like mystery
in beauty boxes which you could order it
was amazing and then something happened
and they couldn't get the products from
Korea like they used to be able to man
had to kill it which was like oh I was
so upset but anyway so this is a mini
box product you've ever heard of mini
box this product can also be purchased
at Ulta com is a different packaging but
the ingredients seem to be identical so
it seems to be the exact same product on
Ulta even though the packaging is all
white instead of this really pretty pink
I wish they had two pink at Ulta cuz I
think it's just so much prettier but I
like I must have done it for some reason
this tool here that we'll be using is
six dollars on Amazon I didn't see this
on ulties website and this is how it
works is basically you put the cleanser
inside and then it's got this a rating
tool and you just kind of go like this
and it aerates the cleanser and makes it
nice and fluffy this is what they say
about it it says the dirty build-up has
snow chance against this against the
snow flake whipping cleanser nudie snow
flake whipping cleanser magically
transforms from a silky cream to a snow
like fluff to gently removed light
makeup impurities and sebum it's a rich
with anti-aging pearl powder and unique
complex of seven white flowers and then
it lists them this cleanser brightens
hydrates and calms the skin and then
when use with the whip maker the dreamy
cleanser magically turns into an even
more luxe dense foam that cleanses
deeply and more gently so we are going
to be using it with this I've never used
it before I'm really excited about it
but before that I want to go into the
claims and whether they're true or not
it does include all of those things but
they're like way down on the ingredient
list
this product has 43 different
ingredients in them and what the FDA
says about the way that ingredients need
to be listed I got to put my teacher
glasses on for this one all right here
we go are you ready for my science there
we go
ingredients present at a concentration
not exceeding one percent may be listed
in any order after the listing of
ingredients present at more than one
percent in descending order of
predominance so what that means is if an
ingredient makes up more than one
percent of a product it has to
listed in order and it has to be listed
first after they get through all of
those ingredients that make up at least
1% of the product then they can list the
remaining products that don't take up at
least 1% of the product in any order
they choose so things like fragrance and
preservatives and things like that can
be mixed up with a bunch of other things
that don't take up more than 1% of the
product so this is where I have an issue
the main preservative in this is
phenoxyethanol that's ingredient number
15 so for me everything else under that
is probably going to be less than 1%
that's my guess before phenoxyethanol
all we have are all of the cleansers and
the foaming things and all of that we
also have glycerin at number 2 which is
an ingredient that I like to see what it
does is it's supposed to draw moisture
out of the air and into your skin it's
also supposed to help your skin from
dehydrating it's supposed to kind of
lock the moisture into your skin so
beyond that there really isn't any
ingredient of interest number one
ingredient is water so once we get past
number 15 phenoxyethanol we get to
fragrance I know some of you do not like
fragrance and we get to pearl powder at
number 29 this is seen as a very
expensive Lux ingredient it can be used
for treating acne things like that we
have something called Saracen which is
the outer layer of the silk thread so
there's like if you imagine like a tube
going through the middle of the silk
thread and then the outer layer is the
Saracen so that is in here that's number
30
then we get to butylene glycol and all
of those root and flower extracts that
reach all the way from 32 all the way
down to 42 and then number 43 is oxygen
there's oxygen in here somehow I don't
really know how that works I'm just
going to trust it you know there's a
minut amount of oxygen that's been
pumped into here somehow now that we
know a little bit about the ingredients
I am going to go get a bowl of water so
that we can do this together in my
sewing room instead of having to take
you all the way to my bathroom now the
Korean way of cleansing your face is to
do an oil cleanser first I'm not going
to do that today because I want to see
how this product works by itself if I
were
doing this on a regular day I would
probably do it oil cleanser to at least
remove my eye makeup but I'm just really
curious how this is going to work and
that's what I feel like I owe you is
it's information about this product on
its own so I've got my bowl of water
here I've got my towel bowl and the
first thing we're going to do is we're
going to squeeze a little bit of product
into this here and that's about probably
about how much I would use I do want to
kind of put a little bit my hands and
see if I can get it to foam up on its
own it has a light sweet perfume II kind
of sense this is what it looks like on
my hands without any water let's put a
little water on my hands and see what
happens no it's just white if there's
nothing magical happening okay I'm just
going to pour a little water in to give
it a little bit of help in foaming and
now I'm going to take my whipper and
we're going on with it real good ten
times left oh my let's push it good
right push it good that works too oh I
can feel it whippin whoa okay so let's
see what's happening here it feels very
thick inside which I'm surprised what
look at that oh that's so cool
how neat and they say that this is good
for sensitive skin too because it helps
the cleanser not to go on so
concentrated because it's diets diluted
a little bit with water before it hits
your face that is cool news okay so now
I'm going to take this and I'm going to
spread the marshmallow on my face there
is quite a bit more cleanser in here oh
this is cool I'm actually very much a
child right now
but feels really nice on the face I'm
scared to put it on my eyes alright
we're going to go for it I'm not gonna
be able to see alright here we go
we're good okay I can't see anything so
I have soap on my eyes and I'm much fun
so this was not well thought out this
was not well thought out
is it rinsed off yet where's the table
okay it's on the table I'm going to wet
I'm gonna have it wet look at my mirror
oh my gosh okay
well it's true that it didn't remove my
eye makeup okay so what I'm going to do
now I'm going to get my Bioderma oh my
gosh
all right I've removed my eye makeup now
let's take the Bioderma and put it here
and I'm going to rub it on my face to
see if the cleanser took my makeup off
see there's any dirt or oil on their
face no there's definitely a tiny bit of
makeup on here just a little bit so just
traces of makeup so I wouldn't use this
alone I would use this with an oil
cleanser first I mean I did have my
makeup on for 11 hours so I feel like it
should have removed all of my makeup I
wanted to do it like this because I know
not everybody does a double cleanse and
I wanted you to be able to see what the
results would be so with this you're
probably going to want to do a makeup
where we were first and then do this
afterward I do have quite a bit of
cleanser left in here so next time I
would use probably half of the cleanser
I kind of like and I would probably just
go next time you know instead of all of
that because that's way too much but
that was really fun I will definitely be
using this again ooh how about this why
don't I rinse this out and I'll get my
regular cleanser and see if it does it
with a regular cleanser because maybe
you just want to buy this and not the
other products
alright I've broken out my skin Iceland
glacial facial wash this is what I
brought on vacation with me I'm really
mostly using oil cleansers right now to
be completely honest with you see okay
so I put in a little tiny bit less we're
going to pour a little bit of water in
and let us pump I can feel it whipping
this is really cool for like a piece of
plastic I was not thinking this was
going to do anything cool check it out I
am totally worked yes that's so cool why
am I so amused by this
I am I still news I can tell you that
just for entertainment purposes only I
totally think the specific word fit I
don't know if like skincare wise is
worth it but this big is really really
fun so final thoughts on these products
the new nice oh snowflake whipping
cleanser it's just okay I wouldn't
purchase this the ingredients are not
impressive the cleansing isn't super
impressive I'll continue to use it it's
not bad but it's definitely not
something that I think is any in any way
magical that I think you should
definitely run out and get this thing no
however I'm having so much fun with for
6 bucks and free shipping if you get it
from Amazon this was fun if you just
want to play if you have a teenage
daughter or son that likes to do like
skin cleansing stuff like this would be
a fun thing to do with them I definitely
am planning on using this again because
I'm just so amused I'm really amused can
you tell it's a little update on the lip
patches from last week they did not work
I'll show them here they're by soo a and
I think that lip patches are just not a
thing that I think will work for me and
let me tell you why does lip patch
didn't go to the center of my lip and
that's where my driest points are and I
really wanted it for hydration and not
necessarily as much anti-aging so if you
mor have more anti-aging concerns around
your lips you may find more benefit to
it because the ingredients were really
really good it's just I don't feel like
it's enough for one-time use kind of
thing I don't know if you do facial
masks maybe and you have fine lines
around your lips or if you're trying to
prevent fine lines around your lips and
maybe but definitely not for hydration
purposes I don't think that I would
purchase any more of those kinds of
things the last thing I want to tell you
about before I end this video is that I
did take a giveaway winner and her name
is Katie wibble and she is a new
