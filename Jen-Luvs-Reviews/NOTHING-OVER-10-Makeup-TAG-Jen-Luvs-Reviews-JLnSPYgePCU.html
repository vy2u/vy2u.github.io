I was about this video and it's like
talk about drugstore products all the
time people probably to be bored because
it's just the same thing that I talk
about all the time and then I started
getting the products out and it was like
kind of getting excited although my
friends welcome to my nothing over $10
tag this tag was created by Tati
Westbrook and I had the glorious honor
of being tagged by Tati I was looking at
the description box and there's all of
these amazing people and then there's me
and it's like yeah I get to be amazing
so I was very honored that she chose me
I know she has very high standards for
videos so that was a huge honor to have
her tag me so I'm happy to report of the
products that I have to show you there
is nothing that costs over ten dollars I
also made sure that everything I used
was currently available for purchase
also all of the tools I'll be using are
also under $10 so let's go ahead and get
started with the Coastal Scents
beginnings face primer this is a really
nice face primer if you like silicone
based primers it does go unclear you can
get this on the Coastal Scents website I
do like a lot of Coastal Scents products
and it feels very smooth very silicone
II to go on I wouldn't say it's
hydrating but it definitely makes the
skin feel smooth it's a nice way to set
the canvas for the makeup for foundation
today speaking of that we're gonna be
using the Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless really love this foundation
I've heard that it's very bad for dry
skin but this isn't a normal to oily
there is a virgin virgin there is a
version of this that is for a dry skin
but I don't own that one I do really
really really really like this a lot I
like the coverage of it I like the
lasting power I like the finish it just
it feels nice on the skin it doesn't
feel particularly heavy and this sponge
I actually just reviewed in my Ulta
brand review that went live yesterday I
believe and it's a really nice sponge it
feels a lot like the Beauty Blender but
but it's a latching bird's 5 bucks
I just feel like it's softer than the
real techniques and I feel like it gives
just a tad bit nicer of a finish so this
kind of gave a like a light to medium
coverage I am gonna add another coat so
you can see how it builds up and also
because I'm filming I like to have just
a little bit more product on one thing I
wish this had though was a pump I'm not
putting on a ton of product either
sometimes people put on a lot more in a
coat than I do I just like to build up
slowly because I get really scared of
cake face this is the hard candy
glamoflauge light I think I'm gonna go
with this one it's dual ended one side
is pinkier and one side is more yellow
this is the pink ear side I think I'm
gonna use the more yellow side today I'm
just feeling it
I had a blemish there last night but
it's kind of gone so that's good
anything else I feel like consoling yep
I think I'm good
there we go I thought I need another
coat of that I feel like it didn't
conceal what I wanted to conceal as much
as I wanted it to conceal let's try
again this is a fantastic brow product
this is the Loreal brow stylist definer
it's really really great right around
that $10 mark it reminds me a lot of the
Anasazi a brow Wiz I was really
surprised to find that they do not share
a lot of common ingredients if they
share any it's not many I was very
surprised because putting them on I
can't feel a difference between them and
I can't see a difference except for in
the shade the L'Oreal one is just a
little bit darker but it feels fantastic
to go on it doesn't feel sticky or heavy
or waxy it goes on super smooth anasazi
definitely has more shade selection
that's the only thing that definitely
they have over L'Oreal for brow gel
another thing from my Ulta brand review
and my haul this is the ultimo it is the
clear one I like it better than the
honest oz you want I just mentioned this
in the old to brand review so I
apologize if this is repetitive but it
holds my brows in place but it doesn't
feel crunchy and it doesn't have a
strong smell
I was looking this up the wet n wild by
Fergie this is there her eyes shadow
primer it seems like this version of it
may not still be available but there's
some different packaging that was
available I think it was at Walgreens
calm or something like that so I did
find it it is a nice eyeshadow primer
it's not my favorite I like it enough
but it's definitely not something I'm
going to repurchase because I do like
other ones better I just discovered the
Ulta brand one that I really really like
what that one is over ten dollars so I
couldn't use it but this one is pretty
decent I've heard excellent things about
the Milani one but I haven't gotten my
hands on it in order to try it it does
feel a little slippy a little oily for
eyeshadow today I have a couple of
things for you I have the elf need it
nude this is at the $10 mark and you can
get this on elfs website I think they
sell in some stores but I haven't been
able to find it in stores around me love
this eyeshadow palette it is super super
fab
and a supplement it just in case I've
brought out my triple baked eyeshadows
by Jake at beauty these things are
stinking amazing they are so bold and
poppy long-lasting amazingness so I
brought out my grilled mango and my
Baked Alaska
both super fabulous so we're gonna just
play I don't really know exactly what
I'm gonna be doing with them yet but
we're gonna just have some fun here so
I'm going to use up in the crease this
one here it's the third one over look at
that pigmentation insane right insane
from ELF are you kidding me out are you
kidding me
this is a very dense brush that I'm
using too so it packs on a lot of color
compared to some brushes that people use
in the crease I'm now I'm just gonna
blend it out with a tapered blending
brush by beauty junkies now the set for
beauty junkies for these brushes is more
than ten dollars but it works out to
weigh less than ten dollars per brush
we're gonna go with the grilled mango
here from Jake at beauty and I am going
to just put the gold shade all over my
lid because it's magical and then this
is the from the Real Techniques I set
this brush here we're just gonna pop
that all over I mean for reals though
for reals Jake at Beauty like no water
no nothing like that
that just happens now I'm going to take
the the deeper middle shade and I'm
gonna pop that on the inner and outer
corners trying to do like a little halo
effect for fun so I'm done one of those
in a little while
mmm it's not really contrasting as much
as I thought at would so I'm gonna go
ahead and mix it with the bottom shade
the deeper shade because I want it to
contrast more and there we go and now
I'm just gonna pop the lighter shade in
the center again just to overlap overtop
of what I just did
so that the center shade pops and so
that it blends and it's a little messy
right now but I'm gonna clean it up
no worries so if you're doing your
eyeshadow and it's getting messy let me
alright don't worry just have fun with
it and then fix mistakes and cleanup
later that's what I do okay so now that
I've got a nice base of shimmer color
I'm gonna go in with some of these matte
shades we're gonna use this deepest
matte shade here and we're gonna go in
the outer corner to deepen up that outer
corner just a little bit and kind of
make that v-shape this is the pro pencil
brush by beauty junkies by the way and
then I'm gonna use the tapered blending
brush by beauty junkies and just blend
it out a little bit and hopefully I
don't blend away my shimmer so now I'm
gonna use this cream shade up here to
blend out my brow bone using that same
taper blending by beauty junkies and a
lot of times what I find when I'm in the
middle of an eye look is it doesn't look
super amazing until I add the the liner
and lashes once I add the liner and
lashes then it all pops and it all comes
together now I'm gonna use one of the
Ulta dual-ended q-tips to just clean up
the outside a little bit and I just
realized I have a ton of fallout right
there that is so not cute
that is so not cute and we'll just use a
little bit of concealer to try to cover
up this fallout here okay
I'm gonna use the other end to just
clean up the inner corners of my eyes
cuz I think I got a little crazy opener
so now we're gonna move on to eyeliner
I just got this Jessie's Girl liquid
eyeliner the green one okay first time
first impression
it looks very olivey it looks like it
would look good with no eyeshadow
because it's not really showing up a ton
I'm gonna make it really thick and then
add a strip of black underneath so I
liked it it's a brush tip because it
bends really easily and it makes for a
very smooth application so now I'm gonna
go in with the Jessie's Girl black these
are my Holy Grail eyeliners by the way
if you did not know these things are
stinkin amazing put this down and see if
I can get my Wang my wings are a little
wonky today don't need wonky wings
tighten these up with one of these
q-tips there we go
am I even I think that I am we're gonna
do mascara and then we're gonna do
lashes because I wanted to show you a
mascara but I also want to put on some
lashes for today so this is the new
Maybelline falsies push-up angel mascara
I'm testing this right now I haven't
decided 100% how I feel about it
but application and removal are pretty
easy it's definitely less clumpy than
the original it brushes out the lashes
much better I really like it but it
still has some clumping issues this one
gets to the edge of the lashes much
better than the original and it's also a
little wetter the wand is really funky
too it looks it's I guess supposed to
look like an angel wing and I really
like how it combs out the lashes without
poking my under eyes because a lot of
times these bristles that comb out your
lashes will stab you in the eye and it's
just not worth it I really like this the
more I use it the more I like it I've
only used it maybe once or twice I was
testing that Ultima Skara so I stopped
using it for a few days I can't even
imagine this on somebody that actually
has long lashes like this would be
insane and it's volumizing too this is
awesome
it's clumping but it's clumping
small pieces not big huge giant spider
clumps I've never used these lashes
before these are the are Adelle 1/10 I
do love ardell lashes though they make
me super happy they're easy to apply
they look good they feel good this one
has an invisible bands and I really like
those and then this is the duo adhesive
the lash adhesive and I like the duo too
I've heard people that don't like to do
over the duo irritates their eyes but it
does not do that to me and these are
brand new so I do need to trim them so
the first time I put on lashes in a very
long time I was on periscope with the
community and they were trying to teach
me how to trim the lashes and the first
lash I did perfect and the second want
to accidentally trend the inner corner
instead of the outer corner and I ended
up having to throw the lashes away and I
was so sad but now I've kind of got the
hang of it and then I'm gonna put my
lash glue on and one of the tricks to
doing this is definitely letting it dry
like give it a good 1/1000 all the way
up to fifteen to twenty one thousand
before you try to put it on okay so that
when I place it I'm gonna place it so
that I feel it on the outer corner and
push it all the way to the edge of my
lash line looking good I don't curl my
lashes before I put on falsies because
my lashes have a natural curl and I hate
eyelash curlers they freak me out so one
thing that I just realized is that
totally covered up my really cool
eyeliner so I'm gonna throw the green on
over top of my lash band because I want
to be able to see it I can't see it
anymore
I'm sealed now looking at this I feel
like I want to do something to my lower
lash line so I'm just gonna take back my
needed nude palette and an angled brush
this one is from Ecotools and I'm going
to use that deepest shade just to give
myself a little bit of
something-something
I feel like dark all the way across is a
little too harsh for me so I just use it
in the outer like 1/3 of my eye and then
I use a brighter color on the inner so
I'm going to use the gold from the jcat
beauty for the
Center all the way out to the middle or
all the way into the middle of gather it
just gives a nice pop especially since
I've got the bronzy shade on the inner
corner of my upper lash the gold on the
bottom looks really cool so there we go
so eyes are officially done done did a
duns on and now we're gonna go into
cheeks and then cheeks are going to be
let's see let's do the love-struck blush
by Jake at beauty this one is in the
shade baby boo it is extremely extremely
pigmented so you have to be very very
careful with these Jake at beauty
blushes I'm gonna just dab just a tiny
bit using my my blush brush by Real
Techniques and then I'm gonna wipe off
the excess because I don't want any more
product on my cheek see I'm already at
clown face Oh
clown nose ah no no alright we're gonna
fix it that is horrible that is the
worst blush application like oh my gosh
like seriously I need to be in the
circus right now what did you do Jude I
should not have used that big huge brush
I got way too much product
holy moly and we take the nut Beauty
Blender but the Ulta sponge and we go
like this and we cover it up because
that is not cute oh there we go and that
actually is almost the coverage that I
was looking for I have literally never
done that before where I have tried to
put the foundation over top to give me
the right coverage but it's a nice
impromptu Beauty hack right there I
don't know it's a little light now I
think I need to find my happy medium so
I'm going to should I should I risk it
again I think I'm going to I'm gonna put
a little bit on this this is the elf
blush brush mmm there we go no more
product no more product look I've got
this big eye shadow mush on the side of
my hand here
oh no that's a burn thought it was eye
shadow but that was when I burned myself
oh my curling iron the other day my
husband came in yelled at me cuz I was
taking too long to get ready and then I
burned my hands and I blamed him it was
totally his fault oh you know what I can
do I'm gonna take this Milani face
powder and try to put that over top to
kind of calm it down because I cannot
find a happy medium to save my life
there we go now we've got it we were
going to come back with the Milani face
powder in a minute but Milani face
powder
to the rescue this highlighting palette
is amazing it is so good and this is
beauty junkies Pro highlighter brush and
we're going to use this one right here
from the elf and this gives a more
subtle highlight it's not a super from
space pop in highlight so if you let the
hourglass once but you don't want to
spend that this is a nice alternative I
don't think it lasts as long as the
hourglass but it's definitely worth it
at the price point Milani face powder
and this brush is the one I typically
use for with my face powder and now I've
got blush all over it like seriously Jen
fail fail fail
alright let's use the other side I think
I can use the other side safely without
touching and I'm sweating my face off
right now so that is not helping my
cause it's freaking me out to see the
blush on the other side totally freaking
me out
alright I think we're good it's not bad
it's not bad it's not my favorite face
look of all time but I like the ID the
eyes are making me happy and I'm gonna
use my Holy Grail lipstick by Maybelline
to touch a spice in the house it was
funny because I put this in my my
ride-or-die tag and everybody was like I
love touch of spice too like not even
kidding
and I don't typically use lip liners and
I don't have a problem with this
lipstick and not using a lip liner it
doesn't bleed on me or anything it's got
a faint scent so if you don't like sense
you probably won't like it
and I really need to stop talking while
I'm trying to put lipstick on lasting
power it does have a little bit of a
standing effect but not incredible it
definitely needs to be reapplied every
three hours or so but it's decent for a
regular cream lipstick that's not a
liquid lipstick and that's it I think
we're done so thank you for watching my
ten dollars and under tag coming up very
soon I'm doing the Dollar Tree tag the
Dollar Tree haul tag I have all my
Dollar Tree stuff right over there so if
$10 is too much I have plenty of Dollar
Tree stuff that we're gonna be trying
out together hopefully we'll be able to
find some great products from the Dollar
Tree that would be amazing
