stamping for beginners tutorial slash
demo slash troubleshooting kind of
situation that we got going on in this
video so basically what I want to tell
you first off is that I am NOT a nail
artist I'm just a regular mom teacher
like just somebody that loves doing my
nails so I shape my own nails I don't
trim my cuticles like this I am NOT a
pro in any way but I think that's
awesome
because if I can do it you can do it too
so enough of my big face let me just go
ahead and show you what you're going to
need in order to stamp nails I'm going
to go ahead and put links down below of
all the websites where I got everything
so first thing you're going to need is a
stamping plate and this is what a
stamping plate looks like it's got
designs that have been engraved into
this metal plate and they saw all kinds
of designs I think born pretty store is
going to be having a sale pretty soon
that's where I got these plates on their
brand new line so definitely keep an eye
out for that if it hasn't already
happened I think that it is a March 26th
is when their new line comes out hasn't
come out as of the filming of this video
but it may be out once I finally get
this video uploaded so that's a great
place to get stamping plates they're
relatively reasonably priced so this is
an example of a stamping plate these I
got from a website called Conad is the
name of the brand and these actually got
these for christmas I can't say I got it
but I got them for Christmas and this is
a really nice nail Stamper some people
will take a file and file this down to
make it more flat I haven't seen a need
to do that but some people they need to
do that so you'll probably see that and
if you look up you know how to stamp
nails I haven't had a problem with this
one just as is it's got a big side and a
small side but if you have nails that
are long you're going to want to get an
extra large Stamper I don't have one of
those I don't have really long nails so
I don't have one one day I do want to
get one though and then you're going to
need your scraper now this is a metal
scraper this is what comes with this you
can also use an old gift card and that
way you won't get these scratches that
you see here not sure if you can see
them but this my plate is starting to
get scratched up from
using it so if you don't want your plate
to get scratched use an old gift card or
an old credit card all right next thing
you're going to need is your gonna get
paper towel to protect your area I have
the half sheet paper towel so if you
have a full sheet you're going to need
two of them so you might rip that baby
in half get one here and then I've got
one here and I'll tell you what we're
going to be doing with that in a minute
now the other thing that I have here are
these love fresh nail polish remover
acetone free wipes now you can do the
same thing by just getting a paper towel
or a cotton cloth or something not a
cloth but you know there's cotton like
pads or whatever that you use for like
toning or whatever and then put some
nail polish remover on it works just as
well but I really like these because
they're convenient they work really well
they're acetone free I feel like if I
use a lot of acetone on my nails my
nails start to weaken a bit they also
don't smell terrible they have like a
little bit of an orange II kind of scent
which I like so these are a must-have
for me personally I'm not sponsored by
this company they don't know I exist I
just happen to love these you can get
these on HauteLook sometimes the flash
sale website or the LA fresh web site
has these on sales sometimes so there
you go so these are a must for me but
you don't absolutely have to have them
all right next thing you're going to
need is nail polish now what you're
looking for in a good nail polish is one
that goes on in one coat you want a nice
thick nail polish even a nail polish
that has like gone down some and now
it's starting to dry out and it's
getting really thick that actually might
be a really good polish to use now one
that's very popular to use for nail
stamping is the Sally Hansen and
subscribe to Enterprise insta-dry this
stuff is awesome and one thing you'll
notice about this is that when I pull
that out even though it's a light color
you can't see the black brush that's
underneath that's how I know it's going
to be a good one
also when I drip it down the side it
drips nice and slow I'm not sure if you
can see that but it drips nice and slow
and it's just it's a perfect polish for
stamping okay one that you're not going
to want to use is like the ciate one of
course it's like way more expensive I
think this might actually be a mini but
if you look at this and you pull this
out and see let's see how you can see
the brush right through it I mean if I
tap it off just the tiniest bit you're
able to see that black brush through it
this is like a 2 to 3 coat polish you
don't want this the
is not good for stamping you're also
going to need a topcoat sesh beat is an
amazing topcoat just in general if you
watch nail polish videos you'll probably
have seen this before get mine at Target
they also sell them at Sally Beauty and
it's pretty reasonably priced if you let
your stamp dry for just a couple of
minutes this will not smear your stamp
at all so definitely recommend this
topcoat so let's go ahead and get
started first thing that I always do
after I paint my nails is I put on my
top coat right away and the reason why I
put on my top coat is because if I make
a mistake then I can use my nail polish
remover wipe and I can take the top coat
off of my nails instead of the first
layer layer of nail polish and then that
way I don't have to start over with
another coat of polish so I'm just going
to go ahead and paint my top coat on all
of my nails and I'm going to let that
dry for about five minutes just to make
sure it's completely dry and then I'll
be back to stamp wood
so the next thing you want to look for
that I want to mention about polishes
making sure you have contrasting colors
colors that are really truly different I
feel like these are going to be great
another tip as far as picking polishes
is metallic nail polishes tend to be
really good for stamping this one is my
absolute favorite polish to stamp with
this is the neighboring color show in
bold gold love this polish it's amazing
I also found some really great metallic
nail polishes at five below and I can't
find them right now it's try to make
crazy I can't find them but I will link
I will put a note down below as far as
what those are called they're metallic
polishes they're awesome one thing is
you want to make sure that your stamping
plate and your stamp are both very dry
that is what this paper towel is for is
making sure stripe because if it's not
dry and things are going to squish
around and it's not going to work well
okay
so we're going to go ahead and I'm going
to stamp this nail first I have picked
this design no particular reason other
than it just looks really pretty one
thing that you want to make sure when
you're beginning is to make sure you
pick a stamp that doesn't necessarily
have to be centered because then it
takes the pressure off of you so like I
would never do this one when I was
starting stamping because this is the
- you know you got to be too symmetrical
with that you know in order for it to be
in the right place you got to make sure
like if you want them to be uniform you
know that's going to be harder to do
there are worse ones than that but start
off with one that takes up the whole
plate and you can make it crooked if you
want like another one I wouldn't do
would be like this one the spaces are
really big and I found that the ones
with the bigger spaces tend to be a
little bit harder to stamp so I wouldn't
do that one either
I would pick ones that have skinnier
patterns and ones that you don't have to
worry about them being centered in any
way okay so I'm going to go ahead and do
this one and we're going to start with
this polish here and some people just
paint the top and then brush it down I
like to paint the whole thing I feel
like it works better now this is
important to move quickly okay all right
let's see if this is going to be quick
enough I don't think it's going to okay
45 degree angle I don't think I went
fast enough we're going to keep going so
I can show you what happens
all right there's my stamp rolling it on
my nail oh it actually kind of worked
but do you see how it's like kind of
crumbly like I don't know if you can see
that but it kind of crumbled on my nail
that's gonna look really pretty when I
actually do it right but the reason why
it crumbled is because I waited too long
so now I'm going to take my nail polish
remover wipe and I'm going to just wipe
that right off and because I had the
topcoat it's like magic I don't even
have to worry about repainting it so now
that I've done a nail and mess it up
royally now I'm going to wipe off my
Stamper with my wipe and I'm going to
wipe off my plate with my wife make sure
it's completely clean then muy
importante very important you need to
make sure it is completely dry both the
plates and the Stamper need to be
completely dry or else you are going to
be out of luck okay so now that that is
done and my nail still looks great and
I'm going to topcoat the whole thing at
the end anyway so if I take the shine
off a bit it doesn't really matter even
though this julep polish is beautifully
shiny this is called
Brianna by the way we're going to go
back to the Instagram and to dry and
this is called blew away by the way and
I'm going to try to do it correctly this
time so I'm going to like focus and try
so I paint the whole thing
hey 45-degree angle oh I forgot to wipe
that off that's not good okay and 45
degree angles scrape that looks much
better
and press and print looks good and I'm
going to can you see it all and I'm
going to roll it BAM and that came out
pretty darn good if I might say so
myself ego so that is how that came out
and I think it looks absolutely
beautiful and the key was to go quick
once you scrape it you gotta go like you
better go quick so now I've got a little
bit of a mess on the corners they're
gonna take that same nail polish remover
wipe and I'm just going to gently just
go right around the edges of my cuticle
you can use um the craft stores have
that that like glue stuff I forget what
it's called again I'll put it down blue
because I'm an airhead and I forgot to
look it up before I started but there's
that stuff that you can put like on the
side of your nail to make sure to like
protect the size of your nail I forget
what it's called though if you want to
do that but this works just as well in
my opinion you can also use a q-tip but
I don't like using q-tip I don't feel
like it works very well can I rub that
on my nail polish remover wipe and you
see how like with a cotton ball or
something that would have just torn up
to pieces that's why I like these is
because this thing can last through the
whole thing and look awesome alright
here we go let's go ahead and do the
rest of my nail see look okay I'm not
going to use this one I'm not sure if
you can see that there you go okay this
one looks kind of squished in the middle
there I don't like it I don't like the
way it looks so I'm going to take it off
and I'm going to do it again
all right so let's go ahead and stamp
the accent nail I'm just going to use
the dark blue color and do the exact
same thing and hopefully it turns out
okay
you can see that is not nearly as opaque
as I would like you can see right
through to that stamp pad so I'm hoping
this in the stamp pad see right through
the plate so I'm hoping this turns out
okay looks pretty good let's go ahead
and stamp it BAM it's a little blurred
but it's okay it'll be alright yeah you
can see how it's kind of blurred a
little bit but it's not bad enough that
it's worth me taking off yeah this
polish was definitely not the best one
to use now I know you live and you'll
learn my friends that's what this is all
about and you just have to have fun with
it you know you can't take it too
seriously you just got to have fun and
if you're having fun then keep going if
for some reason it stops being fun then
stop it's just not worth it don't let it
frustrate you
okay so I don't know if you could see
that oh I just got it all over my finger
so ignore that for a second so you can
see I had this line here so I was like
oh quit thinking I flipped it over to
the other side because I didn't want
that big huge line on there I have way
too much polish on there cuz I was
trying to get to be more opaque and you
see what happened turned into mushy goo
on me so me wipe that off and that is it
it's done except for the topcoat which
I'm going to do in a minute so that is
the finished manicure and I hope you
