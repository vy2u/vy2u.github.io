the K where we test out Korean beauty
products to decide whether they are
worth your time and money today we're
gonna be talking about the Neo Gen
dermology green t real fresh foam
cleanser and if you know nothing about
green tea and the supposed benefits for
your skin you definitely want to watch
the rest of this video stay tuned I
found out about this product on the
asian beauty subreddit on reddit and
people were raving about how amazing it
was and i've been really curious about
green tea and the effects of green tea
on the skin and i wanted to have an
excuse to research more and also to
share more information with you about
green tea and this is the perfect
product for that i did buy this on
amazon for $14.99 from neo gen and they
also have a cranberry and a blueberry
available on amazon there is a cereal
one that exists but it's not on amazon i
don't know where you could get it you
can also get this from SoCo clam it was
wonderful I got to meet them at
generation Beauty in New York really
really nice people a great source for
getting Korean skin care products you
can also get this at Sephora and website
called style Korean it's $19 at each one
of those places but I'm noticing more
and more people trying to support other
companies other than Amazon since Amazon
is kind of taking over the world but you
will pay an extra four dollars to get
this from one of those sources maybe
even plus shipping so you know it's one
of those things this is listed as being
best for normal oily and combination
skin it's also supposed to be very good
for sensitive skin it is not recommended
specifically for dry skin on sephora's
website it does say that it is a unique
foaming cleanser containing for a minute
green tea extract to brighten and
hydrate skin so must be used as your
second step in cleansing after a
cleansing oil Korean skincare routine is
typically a double cleanse so you use a
cleansing oil something wheel base to
remove makeup and dirt and all of that
and then you use a second cleanser in
order to really clean the skin after you
kind of uppermost layers of dirt off for
me personally if I don't wear makeup
then I don't do an oil cleanser makeup I
do in whale cleanse and then I do a
regular cleanser there are over 100
ingredients in this product so it's very
very important to keep in mind the 1%
rule which basically means that any they
have to list in order all of the
ingredients that comprise more than 1%
of this product but after 1% they can
list them in any order and basically
when it comes to this product when we're
thinking about this is let's say you
make a 10 gallon bucket of this stuff
and you put a quarter of a teaspoon of
an ingredient in it then you can you
know imagine how much is in this bottle
which is you know 160 grams 5.6 ounces
you're not gonna get very much of that
ingredient I mean even if you put an
eighth of a teaspoon of an ingredient
you can say that it is in this product
so just kind of keep that in mind with
the hundred ingredients and because of
that we're just gonna focus on the first
10 ingredients and then one more that's
in the top 20 so the number one
ingredient in this is the Camilla census
leaf water or the green tea and the
number two is the Camilla census leaf
and if you look closely at the bottom
I'll do a quick close-up there are
actual leaves floating in the bottom of
this which I think looks really super
cool it's not like it's got like this
little indent here in the bottle and
down here it's just full of these
different leaves hopefully you'll be
able to see it and I just think that
looks really neat I don't know if they
actually do anything but it's kind of
cool a little bit about that particular
ingredient there have been a lot of
studies about ingesting about drinking
green tea and the anti carcinogen
effects of drinking it but there's a
little bit less well a lot less research
on the topical application of it the
green tea leaf contains something called
the EGCG polyphenols and the deal with
that is that's they're known to be anti
carcinogenic and also they have
antioxidant abilities there was a 2003
study published by the Journal of
nutritional biochemistry about this
particular ingredient and it
demonstrated how greens he also works to
reduce
UV induced inflammations so you know sun
damage it's been shown to be an
extremely effective ingredient for
ducing redness and irritation associated
with rosacea which i thought was really
cool cuz I know people with rosacea
really have trouble finding products
that are specifically targeted to them
that actually work I don't have rosacea
so I can't speak to that but definitely
check out the Asian beauty subreddit I
will link it down below and there are
some testimonials from people that do
have rosacea there there was an
anti-aging study done in 2005 with 40
women and basically what they did was
they gave them they had them drink green
tea and they also had them topically
apply a green tea based cream and what
they found was they really didn't see
any differences with the women and their
skin but they did do a skin biopsy on
the women and what they found was the
elastic tissue within the skin was very
much improved one thing about Korean
beauty is instead of like I feel like
American Beauty we really focus on
fixing what's already a problem where I
feel like Korean Beauty it's more about
preventative measures about taking care
of your skin so that it stays looking
young and youthful rather than treating
the wrinkles that are already there you
know what I mean and I feel like this
really seems to be going along the lines
of that the number three ingredient is
something called soapwort which is a
natural cleanser that i found very
interesting there isn't a lot of
information online about it but i
thought that was kind of cool
lauric acid is number seven it is the
main fatty acid in coconut oil it's for
moisturizing but it's also an acne
fighter and then we have something
called sap indus tree full latest it is
called so nut extract and it is a
cleanser and it is for skin conditioning
again not a whole lot of information on
that number nine kind of made me a
little angry to be honest it just says
fruit extract like neogan what's going
on fruit extract there's thousands of
fruits out there like what do you mean
fruit extract what kind of fruit man are
you kidding me like how do they even get
away with putting fruit extract like
what really so that was kind of
irritating number fourteen is the only
ingredient of concern that I found that
was even a little bit of concern
it's an irritation concern and it's
called coca middle propyl betaine and of
course not everybody's gonna be
irritated by it but if you're sensitive
to that particular ingredient you
definitely want to stay away from this
because it is number fourteen the last
ingredient listed is fragrance we don't
know where
that 1% it falls it obviously falls in
the 1% total of the total product in
here but we don't know how much
fragrance so there is fragrance in here
I have been using this for about a week
or so a little less than a week it
reminds me of a hand soaps that have the
foaming pump on them and basically this
you know comes out like this let me
smell it
it does have a very light kind of clean
floral scent it doesn't smell like green
tea to me at all when you put it on your
face the green tea scent really comes
out a little bit more but that is what
it ends up looking like and it feels
really good on the skin it feels very
light and fluffy
ever since I tried that the whipped
cream cleanser that I really liked a lot
I've been using that a lot I've been
kind of into the foaming cleansers I
think there are a lot of fun I think
they feel good let me go ahead and wipe
this off before I tell you a little bit
more when I've used this it feels very
smooth to go on and then when you wash
it off I feel like if there's a little
bit of a tightening feeling but
definitely not as bad as a lot of
cleansers I feel like some cleansers my
skin just feels like you know what I
mean that feeling where your skin super
dry this does not make my skin feel like
that there definitely is a little bit of
a drying feeling but of course once I
follow it up with the rest of my
skincare I don't feel it at all anymore
it feels fine so overall I've been
really enjoying this one way that I test
a cleanser is that I use a Saucedo
facial cotton and I put a little my
solar wanna water on it after I use the
cleanser and see if there's any dirt on
my skin so when I've used this as like a
single cleanse after not you know when I
didn't use any makeup and I just used
this so when I've done that with the
Shiseido facial cotton and the my solar
water and kind of wipes it after
cleansing there's no dirt there's
nothing the cotton pad is completely
clean so that leads me to believe that
this is doing a really good job as a
cleanser and it makes me very happy and
it doesn't dry out my skin the smell
isn't super strong and I've very much
been enjoying it I have nothing negative
to say about this except for where they
said fruit extract I thought that was
super vague and kind of irritated me but
other than that it's been a great
product I have very much been enjoying
it and at this point it is a recommend
from me to you
if you have the skin types recommended
since they don't recommend it for dry
you know we definitely say if you have
dry skin this probably isn't for you
just because they don't recommend it for
you but if you have oily or combination
or normal then this is gonna be
recommend for me to use so I want to
