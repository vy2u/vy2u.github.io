excited my friend a one Eddie Annette
who I did the giveaway Valentine's
giveaway with she told me about a
company called
buzz agent it's a B Z Z agent and it's
kind of like influencer if you've heard
of that where you go on you fill out
surveys and they send you free stuff oh
this is the package on buzz agent and
new Neutrogena products all for free
it's this especially for buzz agent and
it's got a little thing about all little
product products that we got it was
supposed to go with coupons but I didn't
get any coupons I don't know what
happened with that buzz agent why don't
I get any coupons why you're not feeling
the love for the Jen love I don't even
know so I did my makeup all except for
what I got in my buzz agent package so
that I could kind of get like a first
impressions on how this stuff works
so we got two of these these are crease
proof eye shadows this one is in
constant copper and then this one is in
lasting taupe 50 and 40 and these are
antioxidant rich formula nourishes the
delicate eye area a built-in primer
vents creasing fading and smudging shear
sucky color with light reflecting pearls
instantly brightens eyes it's
ophthalmologist tested and safe for
sensitive eyes so we'll see how that
works
so I've got two of these that we're
gonna travel right now and then we've
got my mascara and this is new this is
healthy links mascara hydra preset
longer lashes strengthens lashes to grow
to their fullest potential because we
always want to be at our fullest
potential don't we ladies and that this
mascara helps me be my pose potential
then you know we're gonna be in good
shape and this is in black which is 0-2
and it's got a little picture there how
before strengthens from the inside and
reps the outside and then after you've
got these gorgeous long lashes we will
see I don't know about that usually this
stuff saturates through that length but
we'll see no pun intended
alright the last thing that we got was
this Boop
this I actually open I cheated because I
just couldn't wait to open Ike I'd open
something this is a Neutrogena moisture
smooth color stick your lips were made
for talking should they dress the part
to sheer shiny color instantly
moisturizes lips mango and shea butter
help to continuously condition lips so
they feel softer smoother in just three
days even with nothing on twist up
packaging like a lot of these things
creamy tropical fruit flavor and let me
tell you the price on these this is the
retail price of this is $8.99 the
mascara is $8.99 as well
shadows six or seven ninety-nine each
okay so let's try this stuff out and I'm
gonna use just these four eyeshadow I
have nothing on I've even put a new
primer on because it says these are
primer in themselves maybe that is my
friends let us watch this usually I like
to go light to dark so I'm gonna say
that this is the lighter color and I'm
gonna start and kind of go hopefully
this works out okay it's a little more
powdery than I thought was gonna be I
thought yield more wet formula then it
is and it's pretty sheer rolling up a
little bit okay so I'm just putting that
all over my lid I'm going to either lid
I was expecting more color payoff than
that but it's not bad so far it's just a
little drier than I expected and a
little more sheer okay so that's how
that looks so far that is only this
taupe one so here's this one this one is
the one and constant copper there's that
that one's really light - we'll see whoo
it's for pinky I'm surprised I don't
know if that showing up on camera but
it's very pinky I'm very surprised I
wasn't expecting that this one is
definitely more shimmery than this one
this one's definitely more matte I was
gonna put this on my outer crease but
only it's gonna work I think I'm gonna
put it on the inside now that I see the
color let's say whoo
yeah that's light
that's definitely like yeah this one's
definitely more moist than the other one
I mean I don't know if I would purchase
these I think I would have to try I
don't know let's try putting some other
shadow over top and see if that helps I
brought up my naked - Justin gays and my
eco tools brushes of course see if I can
like maybe work with them to see how
they blend without the colors need
something old darker so let's do a
little snake bite
it's a little crazy right now but it's
gonna get better I promise shoes are
fluffy go up blend out this harsh up
here
that's not blending though they don't
blend see how I've got this right here
how I didn't pull the shadow the new
Neutrogena over I was trying to just
pull that over and it doesn't do that
okay I'm gonna have to go back in with
that a little bit just to pull that out
there we go now we've got something good
going on how does that look at I'm
liking them now whoa
next thing we got was the mascara so
let's go ahead and try that I already
have two three mascaras open right now I
have the prop UT one that I got in my
Ipsy bag that I cannot stand it is the
driest formula it lengthens some but for
the most part it doesn't really do
anything I don't like the pop Beauty
mascara they gave and but I really love
my new dior curling mascara that I got
from Sephora as 100-point perk and I
also love my new Almay get up and grow
Oh amazing so let's see this one is so
here's the wand say the wand okay I kind
of typical spooty spoolie feels very
thick healthy lengths okay healthy legs
oh I came out nice and black here we go
whew I'm liking this already separating
my lashes nicely really lengthening Wow
hollow lashes look at the difference
between my lashes remember this one has
nothing and this one just has the new
Neutrogena and no clumpy clump 'yes
that's good least so far again this
first impression my friend so I don't
know how this stuff is gonna age as I
use it more I was not expecting to love
this because I don't typically like
masks or most mascaras I don't really
like I am super impressed that's that is
one coat let's put another coat holy
ghazali
Neutrogena holida I didn't even know
Neutrogena I don't know anything by
Neutrogena but this stuff is amazing
every when you have a set come look at
my lashes cool huh
I like it yeah are those for you yeah
baby they're real I'm loving it like
seriously I'm loving it has nothing to
do with the fact I got from Buzz agent
like I'm serious I'm loving it okay last
thing is the lip and I love the Revlon
kissable balm stain so I'm curious to
see if these are gonna be similar
very pink pink with a little coral ish
mostly pink here let's watch us watching
yeah a very pink pink any pink pink pink
um I don't typically wear this bright of
pink but I think for springtime it'll be
nice I just got a rock the right look
with it it'll be good not paint it and
I'd like that I like that it's not super
super pigmented where it's like clown
makeup you know you can still see the
texture of my lips my lips feel very
moist very very moist like a like lip
balm very smooth definitely not sticky
in any way it's the only not a lip balm
as far as pigmentation you can see that
these are my first Neutrogena products
and I love them I am so incredibly
shocked I really thought that I wasn't
going to like them because you never
hear anything about Neutrogena but I'm
gonna be talking about it now I want to
see what other colors are gonna come out
within this because if they have more
like nudish kind of colors I'm
definitely gonna look into those I'm
curious to see what other colors are
gonna have of these two buzz agent
you're supposed to be free but you're
gonna make me spend some money now so if
you're not signed up for buzz agent go
on sign up now so worth it they don't
just have makeup they have all kinds of
stuff it's mostly other things I think
like I got a coffee one that I didn't I
too late on the email that's the only a
thing is when you get an email from
buzzes you got a jump on it right then
before it fills up or else you will lose
out on your offer when you fill out
surveys on there they send you basically
kind of like Influenster things that you
might be interested in so I hope you
enjoyed that video if you did make sure
you hit the thumbs up button if you want
to see more of my videos make sure you
hit there and I will see you in the next
video
thumbs up Neutrogena great job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
