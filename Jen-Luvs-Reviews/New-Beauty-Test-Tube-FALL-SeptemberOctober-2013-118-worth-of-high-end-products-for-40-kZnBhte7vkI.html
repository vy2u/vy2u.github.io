time again for another new Beauty task
to air Teddy help me focus excuse my
cracking voice everybody my family's
been sick so now it's my turn but it
sounds like it's just my voice and not
you know I'm not feeling too terrible
which is a good thing i wanted to share
this with you i cannot i got it
yesterday and I open it up and i was
like thinking about cheating but then it
was rap like this and it's like I can't
even cheat and you guys would know
because you're smart thankfully this new
Beauty test tube all I had to do is pay
for shipping thanks to that person right
there I do get free new Beauty test
tubes when someone signs up using my
link there's a five dollar off discount
and I'm gonna give you information about
that later but I can't wait to show you
this I'm going to show it to you right
now okay so I hate to rip this little
sticker cuz it's just so pretty I've
been really happy with new Beauty test
tube lately the first one was terrible
there's a video of me like basically
crying over this too because it was so
awful so if you want to see me almost
cry there's I'll put the video link down
below to that video and my other new
Beauty test tube by tube openings I
can't call it BOTS it because it's not a
box but it's a tube oh I'm already say
good things alright so the first thing
I'm seeing right now is this from it
cosmetics oh by the way new BB chest
tube ends up being like forty dollars
including shipping so I think if they
say it's 29 99 but then it's like eight
something or nine dollars for shipping
so it's basically 40 bucks so this says
it's a it cosmetics heavenly luxe powder
brush mmm look how pretty it looks off
NC whoo I like it already because it is
very dense and soft whoo I cannot wait
to use this and i have been using a the
elf flat top brush for powder and i like
it but i really wanted to try something
different so I'm so excited to try this
yeah and I don't know in any products by
it cosmetics this is my first one so I'm
super super excited to try that we got
it it cosmetics little book here I guess
it kind of gives you
kind of a little rundown of all their
products in any issues on its way look
for in a few weeks I guess they didn't
put the magazine in here that it's
coming separate so they must not have
been ready new PT magazines okay it's
got some good articles in it but I don't
like how thick it is because it has so
many stinking ads and the ads just
outrageous I mean I know beauty
magazines have lots of ads but this one
has a lot of bad and then here is the
products they're inside and I won't look
at this because I don't want to spoil it
now the tube definitely looks different
this time usually it is longer and
thinner and this time it's fatter it
feels pretty full and pretty heavy so
I'm really excited about this new Beauty
test you experiment with Beauty the
beauty sampling program cool i like this
so far Oh fumble first thing ah stop it
what okay first thing I see is a
Smashbox photo finish face primer and I
do love this stuff I didn't recently
just get one of these in my Ipsy bag but
it is one of my favorite foundation
primer so I will definitely take that
really happy about this next up we have
the oh my goodness i hate when i get
french stuff because i don't know how to
pronounce it and your people to speak
French you guys know when I sound
ridiculous la roche-posay new melody
deep cleansing brightening foaming cream
interesting so we'll just open up the
box and see what it looks like I will
probably pass this on to someone okay so
there we go uneven skin tone and skin
discolorations is what it's for next up
this is one of my favorite hair products
and I have so much of this stuff like if
I didn't already have a ginormous bottle
of this I would be happy to get this
this is the biosilk silk therapy and
this duck really is awesome this is
another thing I'm going to put my
giveaway box it was right around
Halloween I gave away one of these
because it was one in my favorite things
giveaway that I did this stuff is
awesome okay next up we have from mally
beauty and ever color starlight
waterproof eyeliner and I've heard
wonderful things especially from
emilynoel83 if you don't already know is
like my youtube idol there's the cadence
here what is up with cicadas oh they're
so loud and obnoxious it says it's in
the color ice blue boo pretty this will
be really nice for water line I wouldn't
put this on my upper lash line because I
think that would look really creepy on
me first watch let me do it once watch
and then I'll do a double swatch under
it I guess I look the same hey I did a
single swatch here and then a double
swatch here just to see if it was going
to be more pigmented and it looks like
it's not super pigmented I I really like
the idea of getting this product but i
don't think that ice blue is a one that
i will use off whole lot i am thankful
to have it but I wish I got in a
different color and then one more thing
this is it huh okay it's a 10 miracle
leave-in plus keratin i just finished
today the miracle leave-in light and i
loved it i absolutely loved it i almost
cried when i had to like tilt it to the
side to try to get the last bits out it
is a fantastic product now I've heard
this one is very heavy on the hair so
I'm curious to see how this one compares
to the light if I don't like this I will
be repurchasing the light because I
think it's amazing it really definitely
gave my hair extra shine and
manageability and I absolutely love it
so I'm curious to try this version of it
and see how it compares oh no there's
one more thing in here this is what is
it color control cushion compact what
does that even mean there is there a ran
on here a more pacific ok amore pacific
it's confusing me it's in the color tan
blush it's got SPF 50 okay just a hint
if you are a cosmetic company and you
create a product and you decide you're
going to make something that doesn't
exist anywhere else at least put on
there what it does so I open it and
there's this little patty thing in here
and it looks like it might be there's a
little plastic oh they're good the
plastic weird it's like a spongy its
spongy you're okay I'm gonna put on my
hand weird what is this stuff is it
foundation is a concealer what are you I
don't know what you are you weird things
color control cushion compact what are
you it was so confused there's a blue
side in a white side I don't I'm hoping
that the magazine will help me know what
this stuff is that's what it looks like
on my finger and then I'll swatch it
kind of there so maybe it's a color
corrector I don't know I don't know what
are you the ultimate addition to any
regimen you'll cut your morning facial
routine in half as multitasking compact
provides to protect hydrates and acts as
coverage for your sched and make up five
evenly brains and hydrate skin so I
guess it's a primer anti-aging
powerhouse green tea treatment complex
can be found this formulas fights
against aging process and provide
antioxidant based protection it says it
says to use them won't use in the
morning and reapply regularly throughout
the day as desired basically it looks
like it's it's like kind of a foundation
II kind of like product that you for
like color correcting maybe like through
the day or like I don't know i'll i'll
play with it and see what i can use it
for i'm still a bit confused even after
reading the book i'm still a little
confused now that I've gotten everything
out of my tube this was a pretty weak
tube as far as the contact I'm having
with what I've gotten so far but it's
not a lot of stuff here what we normally
get next up is the bonus products we got
another dr. Brandt product is the
collagen booster for all skin types so
I'm really anxious to try this I don't
really know how to use it or what to do
this it just as gently massage on face
use am &amp;amp; PM i might add this to my
current giveaway because i have faced
products available for my giveaway if
you don't if you haven't enter the
giveaway giveaway yet i'll put a link
down below i might add this to it
because i don't know if i need a
collagen booster at my age I'm not quite
ready for that unless I put on my for it
cuz I've some pretty deep wrinkles on my
forehead but other than that I don't
really need that so i might add this to
give away we'll see we've gotten these
before this knit fab needle fix serum
viper venom wrinkle fix got two of those
and i did try this and for me it didn't
really do much but I again I think I'm
too young for a lot of this stuff for it
really to make a difference and I
learned that when I did the video with
my mom on that skin
cream then I really am too young for a
lot of this anti aging stuff and then
here is it a BB cream oh that's cool
it's a lumen a i think it's blue mean
we'll say lou mean finland's BB cream i
definitely will be trying this though
because i love love love to trying to DD
creams so the number of products was
definitely less than usual the total
value of this tube is right there if you
feel like that was a good value and this
is something you would be interested in
getting there is an opportunity for five
dollars off of your first tube I am NOT
going to put my link down below what I'm
