review of new Beauty test tube I love
this subscription service I genuine lead
you um every once in a while we get a
tube that's just it makes me want to cry
because it's so bad but for the most
part I'm having every subscription
services like that when you get one more
to call my gosh wow that was terrible
but this one is genuinely pretty good
overall I'm very happy the products I
very rarely had a tube where I felt like
it was not worth the forty dollar
subscription price speaking of that I am
very thankful to the people who have
signed up using the link provided by new
Beauty test tube through my account this
person right here has contributed to the
price of this box for me by using my
link to sign up for new BB test tube so
thank you if you're interested in saving
five dollars on your subscription to new
Beauty test tube in new one and then
just send me an email at gem those
reviews at gmail com and then I send
your email a new Beauty test tube and
then they send you an email with your
code so that you can get five dollars
off so if you're interested in that let
me know you could also just go to new
Beauty test tube com I think it is I'll
put the link down below just straight up
if you just want to straight go there
and sign up you can do that too it's of
course no pressure so so anyway you guys
came here to see the tube so i'm going
to show you the two and this is the box
that it comes in and then when you open
up the beauteous paper you get no no no
those is laureus content and i see right
away a vote evo candle we got one of
these for december november the november
december box and it was like a pine tree
kind of sent my husband really liked it
i'm not that big of a fan of that smell
but it was a really nice candle so i'm
curious i smell this this one is in red
currant or read quran i always have
trouble pronouncing that i'm not sure
which one it is um i'm sure one of you
will let me know down below cuz you're
so good at that stuff um i'm not sure
about that it's got a berry scent but
it's very perfumey smelling and it's got
a little bit of oil on top which i think
is a little
strange do you guys see that the oil
weird I don't know where that comes from
but I am anxious to use this I'm sure
that it will be used well so now there
are some bonus products in here that I'm
not going to get into until the end
because the bonus and then we also get
this new beauty test tube a little book
that was not only book it's a little
magazine anything that has all the
products inside it feels very thin this
times that makes me a little bit nervous
so we shall see let's see what's in the
two so this is how the tube comes they
just change the packaging a couple of
tubes ago like two tubes ago to be this
big more fat or two but not quite as
long mmm and then there it is packed to
the top so first thing I am seeing is oh
this is not a good start my friends it's
not a good start my friends this is the
Pantene expert collection advanced
keratin repair conditioner i will try
this i am then going to have it is a
ginormous sample size but i always get a
little disappointed in a new beauty when
they include drugstore products just
because it is such an expensive
subscription service and i bet the
conditioners in here too because usually
they put the conditioner in here yeah
they did oh wait no wait this is a
conditioner boo this is a conditioner
and then this is the shampoo so I like
how they put in the plastic so that it
doesn't spill which is really nice but i
will try these but not excited about
those at all alright neck not starting
off good my friends well that's not true
this is a really good product this is
this is Moroccan oil and it is a body
butter and I think they've sent this
before if it wasn't them it was another
subscription service so here we go
ladies as I usually do when I get a
duplicate product of sports something
that i don't think i'll use i think will
be beneficial to others i'm going to
give this a way to one of my subscribers
so but i'm going to change the rules a
little bit so that more people have an
opportunity and usually I say just
whoever the first person is down below
comment and you will win it we're not
going to do it like that we're going to
do the everybody that comments within
the first 24 hours that they would like
this then you will be entered your name
I'll put in a random
org and one of you will win this and
I'll contact you and let you know keeper
at watch the rest of video because it
may be something else in here we don't
know so yeah really really great product
moisturizes very nicely slightly greasy
but it's a body butter and what do you
expect but a really really nice product
I just already have one and I plenty of
stuff like this Oh see this is drugstore
but I'm actually excited about this
Revlon age-defying wrinkle remedy line
filler I've heard really good things
about this I think this is correct me if
I'm wrong my friends but isn't this from
the new revlon age-defying line that
they just came out with it they're
people everybody's raving about the
foundation I could be wrong but I'm
really excited to try this even though
it's drugstore I'm very excited about
this cool app at jetway with fingers
directly into fine lines wrinkles and
crow's feet to instantly smooth skins
appearance I am in my mid-30s believe it
or not so when you get up a really close
the reason one of the reasons why I
don't do tutorials as I do have some
fine lines in my eye area especially so
very excited about that and if you saw
my video where I tested an eye makeup
remover concoction i'll put the link
down below you can see why i have
wrinkles is because I pull on my eyes
too much oh here we go another good
product okay we're redeem in ourselves
new Beauty weird even ourselves mally
ever color starlet waterproof eyeliner
cool I did get one of these before in a
light blue and I really like it I know
it's not a very wearable color but it's
really nice in the water line or on the
lower lash line sometimes and it looks
like this is black dark blue think it's
dark blue let's see yeah looks like dark
blue let's watch ass Walter swatches
watchu creamy look how pretty i actually
that looks kind of black I don't know in
the light it looks blue but it looks
pretty black that's very wearable I've
heard a lot of really good things about
using dark blue eyeliner so actually oh
I have an urban decay one let's compare
cuz comparing is fun oh let's see where
are you Urban Decay all right Urban
Decay's binge I have and I think I got
this and I got this at nordstrom rack it
was on super duper uber sale I think it
was like four dollars or something
ridiculous alright so let's watch you
that next to it and see how it compares
definitely still creamy this one's more
Lou so it's nice that i have it's a
different color the Mallee is just a tad
bit darker than the Urban Decay so
that's cool excited about that yeah okay
new Beauty you're bumping it up all
right I'm happy so far okay I'm good I'm
good I'm solid okay biosilk volumizing
therapy texturizing powder I got
something like this from the big sexy
hair company and I really liked it and I
do enjoy bio soap products the ones that
I tried I like they're um silk therapy
the little oily stuff that you put in
here to kind of smooth your flyaways and
make a little more calm so I'm excited
to try this very good okay and then
there's only one more thing what we're
thinking here that's not a lot of stuff
I have this too urgh i'm from this true
okay I'm but i only pay technology was
true but i can't complain if i pay forty
dollars i probably wouldn't be happy
this is the june jacobs skincare papaya
purifying enzyme ask I already have one
of these it's been in my giveaway box
I've tried to give it away multiple
times to people when I've had you know
shot my stash giveaways and nobody ever
wants it but I've heard you and get
Jacobs is a great company so I mean it's
a big sample size it's 1.6 fluid ounces
hey any all want this you can have it so
now there's two things up for grabs so
we've got this Moroccan oil put a
comment if you want that and you can
also say if you want the june jacobs
just put them in the same comment
there's no point putting it twice now
but that's it really seriously new
beauty series that's not a la style
bonus bonus products because bonus
products you've got to be kidding i see
something else i already have what okay
this right here i actually got two of
these in another subscription months
maybe i just have too many subscription
boxes maybe that's the problem this is a
why the f lip gloss and it's teeny teeny
tiny and it's in the same color in beach
barry i had two of these and then i gave
one away as like a bonus in one of my
giveaways or something i just threw it
in the second one that had it is a
really nice lip gloss it's got like a
brush applicator and it is a slight bit
sticky it's got a relatively nice smell
and it's relatively nude it's got a very
just a little bit of color to it so this
is a third thing you can
and i'm giving away half my tube is
already has done but yeah if you want
the lip gloss right I didn't hear
comment goodness gracious all right next
up lumene okay i do really likely mean
face cream products another drug store
this is called the time freeze firming
day cream with Arctic Heather excited to
try this I did use up both my day cream
and I night my night cream from looming
that I've gotten or lumen-a I might be
lumen-a but I've used both the day cream
and the night cream of these and I enjoy
both of them not the perfect formula a
little tiny bit greasy on my skin but
overall really enjoy these products so
excited about that and then the last
thing in the bonus products is 90 second
wrinkle reducer hydroxatone what is this
temporarily reduces the appearance of
crows feets fine lines wrinkles under
eye bags I might actually give this to
my mom sorry mom did I just say that
that wasn't very nice but she she would
probably benefit I mean she's you know
the mom of someone who's 35 so she she
would probably really like this I might
give this to her I probably will because
I don't need this as much as someone
who's older than me would oh no beauty
oh there's one more thing in here ok
this is the DDF doctors dermatological
a-- ultralight oil-free moisturizing do
so it's just a little foil pack of some
moisturizer I'll use it I'll try it sure
we'll see how it goes so new Beauty
friends overall not so happy with this
tomb not happy at all I'll show you what
I'm excited about happy about the
firming day cream very happy about the
Revlon age-defying line filler very
happy about the Mallee liner I'm gonna
give this to my mom useful for her but I
wouldn't say this is something I would
have purchased this one the volumizing
therapy I probably would not purchase
that the Pantene would not have
purchased that and then all oh and the
candle probably wouldn't have purchased
that cuz I'm not a big fan of the scent
and then the other three products I
already had from other subscriptions so
if I had paid forty dollars for this
these would be the three products that i
am happy about and i know that that just
not even close to add up to forty
dollars so wah wah wah for new beauty
test tube not happy this month my
friends not happy but you can't win them
all you know what I'm saying not every
tube can be fantastic and this just
happens to be a bone too so anyway I
hope you all enjoyed that unboxing even
though it's a wah wah uh if you did make
sure you hit the subscribe button so you
can see more of those give it a thumbs
up that way this video moves up in
rankings so that more people can see it
that's the purpose of a thumb so that's
it for new beauty test tube I have tons
of box openings coming this week all my
boxes all came at one time so if you
want to see more definitely stay tuned
mad love and I will see you very very
