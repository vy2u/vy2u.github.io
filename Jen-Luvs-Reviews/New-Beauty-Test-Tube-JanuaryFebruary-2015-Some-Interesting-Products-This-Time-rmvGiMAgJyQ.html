hello my friends welcome to another new
Beauty test tube new Beauty chest tube
has been really to say it politely
horrible okay that's not plate but it's
honest it's been it's been really bad
lately like all year last year it was
bad I think we got like one or two out
of the six were good and the rest were
really bad and the big reason why they
were really bad was because there were a
lot of repeat products that I'd already
gotten and sometimes the entire tube was
pretty much filled with repeat products
and then like some other little tiny
things or none and the value just hasn't
been there it's been really bad but
let's move on from there because it's
2015 it's a new year this is the
january/february tube now new Beauty
test tube is thirty-nine dollars
including shipping but i only pay i
think eight dollars for at nine dollars
for some like that because every time
someone signs up using my link i get a
free tube so this tube is courtesy of
this person thank you so much for
allowing me to get this just for
shipping costs I really appreciate it so
the way that I review this is I review
this as if I paid the full thirty nine
dollars for it so just so you know I am
very thankful I think this tube is
always well over worth the eight or nine
dollars that i pay for it but i'm
reviewing it for people that don't
typically get that so enough about that
let me just show you what's in the tube
and let me tell you that this one is
better okay it's not great but it's
better okay and let me show you why so
first let me to show you that it comes
with this little booklet in this booklet
has a little summary of all the products
that are inside i'm not going to show
you some want to show you yet what's in
the tube I'd rather show you what it is
but then it comes with this this is the
new Beauty test tube and sometimes they
should throw products on the outside now
it had this for a while I've been trying
a lot of the products out so I'm not
sure what came on the outside but I know
I couldn't fit everything back in so I'm
just going to start with my very very
very very very favorite thing that I
gotten this and this is part of the
reason why i love this month's will
bimonthly whatever you want to call it
of newbie
test tube is because there's a lot of
new products there's a lot of things
that I've really been loving so this is
by color club and this is there mm-hmm
dry ice rapid nail lacquer dryer what
you do is you put on your polish and
then once you're ready for your topcoat
you bring your top coat on you let the
top go dry for a minute you pop this
stuff on and I'm telling you your nails
are completely dry in less than five
minutes it feels like water to go on the
way that it comes out is like a little
dropper so you push down on this little
button on the top push that down you see
little bubbles I don't know if you can
see that but little bubbles I probably
shouldn't do that cuz it'll mess up the
formula but you suck up a little bit of
product and then you just drip it on
your nails and I have been absolutely
loving this and I'm so thankful to have
this and to know that this exists
because this will be a repurchase when I
run out of this because I am loving it
let's open up the tube this is a product
I haven't had a chance to try yet
because I'm trying a lot of face
products right now for Wisconsin mom
Mandy is doing a sample doubt challenge
on Instagram of a triangle out of
products for that and this just hasn't
made it into the rotation yet this is
the algenis firming and lifting cream
and I'll show you kind of what that
looks like and I have not touched it yet
so that's what that looks like on the
inside looks very creamy and i'm just
going to just put a little bit on my
hands it feels like a cold cream right
now like as far as the texture and smell
is very fresh clean with a touch of
sweet touch of floral as far as it in my
hand of course it's not a hand lotion
but as far as seeping into my hands it
feels a little slick almost it's hard to
describe it Sal it's just a little bit
slick but it is seeping in very nicely
at this point and I don't feel any
stickiness it feels very nice now a lot
of these things my friend Stacy over at
UH I can't remember what a channels call
what happened my brain is second ago
just polish Polish polish ways there we
go so my friend Stacy ever had polished
ways I remember a long time ago she had
another channel and she always called
them lotions and potions where she felt
like none of the anti aging stuff
actually worked for her so and I kind of
feel the same way where I feel like a
lot of this stuff it's just the
nice moisturizer I don't know if it's
actually anti-aging effects but again I
have not tried this so I don't know but
I'd love to hear your opinions down
below in the comments if you tried the
AL genest firming and lifting cream I'd
love to know what you think of that now
this is the next thing this is the only
thing that I've gotten that I got that
I've actually tried before and this is
the balance guru no frizz oil and I do
like this and put it on right after you
wash your hair or you can put it on when
your hair is dry and just kind of calms
the frizz and it's a nice hair oil and I
do like that it is a natural hair oil
the number one ingredient is soybean oil
believe it or not and then olive oil and
then castor oil and then argan oil so
it's really just a mix of different
whales I forget what it smells like I
think I remember it smelling citrusy yep
it has a lemony kind of smell but it
doesn't smell like lemon pledge it's
more of like a fresh smell so definitely
a win on that even though it is a repeat
product i am happy to have it again next
up one of the least exciting products
that we got was the era clear new era
and skincare ever moist lip balm it
feels very moisturizing at least to me i
love the way it smells its got like a
vanilla cake kind of smell to it it
smells really nice but the number one
ingredient is petrolatum and i
personally every time i talk about how I
don't like petrolatum I always have
people saying petrolatum is great but I
I personally don't like it I don't like
that it's so close chemically to
gasoline it just kind of freaks me out
and also I don't feel like my lips get a
lot of benefit from it but it does feel
nice on the lips it really does i have
used it a few times i haven't noticed
anything magical in my lips but it does
feel nice i have to admit i am enjoying
using it so next up is another hair oil
which i think is kind of weird to put to
hair oils in together but this one I
really like a lot this is the chi argan
oil plus marengo oil hair oil and let's
see the ingredients here I don't even
know I can't even pronounce this I'm
going to put it here what the first
ingredients are because they're very
chemically sounding and let's see we
finally get to the argan oil at one two
three four five the sixth ingredient
down is the argan oil and one thing that
I do not like that i see is dimethicone
all the mythic on all which i think is a
silicon my friend Linda over at the
beauty puzzle I was just watching one of
her videos today and she was talking
about how i dye my dimethicone
dimethicone i meant something like that
I don't know I forget but when you see
that in there it's a silicone and really
what that does is give you the illusion
that your hair is getting moisture when
really it's just silicone making your
hair feel smooth but it's not really
doing anything for you you know it's
kind of like a faker you know it was all
a red herring it was just the silicone
it wasn't a real moisturization but I
have been enjoying this I I feel like it
feels really good maybe it's those first
ingredients that I don't know what they
are but I will look it I will look them
up and I will put them in the
description sure that we all are more
educated as far as the ingredients in
this but I feel like it's working maybe
it's just the silicone stinks that argan
oil is all the way down there and
where's the Marengo oil is that even in
there there's the argot Oh Moringa
maringÃ¡ oil is after the argan also its
seventh so I have been liking it so
that's two things that I don't like the
ingredients in it but yet i'm enjoying
them who knew ok so moving on to more
things in here one that i haven't tried
and one that I love this is the
dermatological daily microbe foliot and
I have not tried this yet either I'm
sorry major fail but I was trying to use
up some of these samples that I've had
forever and I've had them open and I
don't want them to go bad so I have not
tried this yet but this is going to be
making it into the rotation this is for
daily use and it's an exfoliating powder
after cleansing dispensed into wet hands
and create a creamy paste and then you
massage it onto your face for one minute
avoiding the eye area then rinse all
right we're gonna try this out right now
so you guys can see what what's going on
here okay we're gonna try this out
actually think I got this in a new
Beauty test tube a while ago this is the
VNA thermal spring water and some people
swear by the stuff I didn't see any
difference suppose Lisa from some
magical spring somewhere that has all
these healing properties but it's just
water basically like from a magical
place under a fairy's room there i don't
know but wow that's too much that's not
good okay i don't think that was
supposed to happen hmm oops okay all
right let's scoop some of that back we
don't need all that
not exfoliate and everything but you can
see it comes out like a powder so here's
the powder there and then I'm just going
to spray some of this water here just
for convenience sake so we can see what
it's like me kind of you okay I'll write
many more water more water more water
okay so you can see what that would end
up looking like as you exfoliate it's
just kind of sandy it's turning into
like a paste almost it doesn't feel as
gritty as I thought it would it just
feels kind of thick and almost clay like
like a thin layer of clay like I can
feel my hands kind of sticking like clay
um yeah so I'd be curious to know what
this does to my face I think will be fun
to use and I am thankful to have it so
again something new and interesting that
I get to try which is what subscription
boxes are all about you know what i'm
saying i rinsed off my hands very very
easily and there was no grit there was
nothing difficult to get off so i will
definitely be using this at some point
just not today and the last thing in
here I was super excited about it's
actually all gone there's nothing I can
show you and it was the chlorine dry
shampoo this stuff came out like a stick
of fire hose like it was like and I was
like you know your hair was like in the
wind like you're in some exotic photo
shoot and your hair just blowing
everywhere I mean it was like powerhouse
of a spray I don't think there's any
left but oh my gosh this was an amazing
dry shampoo for me now I have normal to
oily when my don't wash my hair my hair
gets really gross I can usually go a
solid two days to two to three days
without washing my hair like the third
day is when I got to use the dry shampoo
two days people don't even know but the
third day I definitely saw dry shampoo
so i was using this and man was i
impressed this is seriously like I love
my Betis that's my favorite i love the
Battiste brunette I've heard some bad
things about the booties for not lately
for some reason but I really like it and
then this one though I think beats out
both of those as being the most
effective because it lasted longer in my
hair so like if I spray on the Battiste
I would feel like you know few hours
later my hair just looks just the same
was it dead before I even sprayed it on
this lasted like all day long like you
didn't even know that was like third day
hair or whatever and I had this um I'm
seriously this will be a purchase as
soon as I can find it I don't even know
where to buy this but when I find it it
probably amazon sure has it i will be
purchasing this because this stuff is
amazing for me personally so before i
talk about value let me preface this by
saying this is my favorite new beauty
test tube i have gotten in a very long
time because their new products that
I've never tried except for the one and
that one I like and they are ones that
are fun to try that I never would have
tried if I hadn't gotten my new beauty
test tube now that I said that let's
talk about value so if I were to try
this sample in a store i would pay four
dollars for this sample this i feel like
is probably a little more expensive i
would pay eight dollars for that the
dermatological is probably more as far
as an exfoliant i would say for the
sample if this is a sample let me see
how much the full sizes i guess i can't
cheat I can't cheat I'm not gonna look
and see how much a full sizes I'm not
gonna cheat I don't know the full size
of any of this stuff is for this mmm
this will probably last a while I'm
gonna say another 10 for this for this
this i will say another 10 for this
cream because there is quite a bit of
cream in here oh no it's all Genest so
we'll go 10 again I'm going I'm shooting
a little high on this one cuz I've been
accused lately of shooting too low so
we'll go a little high alright the dry
ice I would definitely pay eight dollars
for this it's even though it's probably
more if it's more I would probably pay
more for it really and truly but i would
expect this to be about eight dollars
and then this here this hair oil the
sample size six dollars something like
that and then the lip i would pay four
dollars for it so I'm just kind of
thrown those numbers out there you know
what the numbers are as far as the whole
value of the box and the value of my
personal value but when it comes down to
it really and truly I don't think this
is worth forty dollars really and truly
I mean if it is it's not by much alright
so let's zoom in over here alright so
there is he's my dirty desk there is
forty dollars worth of products if I saw
that in a box at the
door and that said that that was forty
dollars there's no way in the world I
would pay for that they're going in the
right direction but I don't think
they're quite there yet and that's my
review of the january/february new
beauty chest tube if you enjoyed it and
