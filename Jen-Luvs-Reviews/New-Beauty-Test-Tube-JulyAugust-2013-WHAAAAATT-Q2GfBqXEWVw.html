excited to bring you another new beauty
test tube I am so excited about this
because I got this box for free and that
is thanks to my friend my new friend
emily Thorne who is one of my
subscribers and she was kind enough to
sign up on through an email program that
they had going on thing and basically
she signed up she got five dollars off
her first one and then I got mine for
free also my friend my new friend Tammy
Morrison got one too so I'm going to get
next to free too so you get to see not
just this video but the next one and
then we'll see after that let's get
right into the tube i just opened up oh
we got booze products again yeah okay so
let's see what's in here because if you
see my last two new Beauty test tube
videos the first one was like this huge
box that was almost crying it was
horrible it was the worst one of the
worst forty dollars i spent in my entire
life was so disappointed the second one
was awesome but then i heard later on
that it was actually a repeat too they
had actually sent out this tube on
another occasion so this could have been
a complete duplicate to which i think is
awful to set up the same two twice but
it happened to me a really awesome too
okay so let's see what's inside I'm so
excited the first thing I'm pulling out
oh oh my goodness i see tart colors and
get start yup it is tart here America
Joelle I have never tried this I've
always wanted to try this I am so
excited about this so I'm gonna credit
Emily for this box every time I'm gonna
say thank you Emily since you use it
kind of the same way you use argan oil
it says face and neck this one doesn't
say you can put it on your hair I'll
have to look that up and see oh we got
another way is this the same one he
already made simple
by philosophy we got one of these last
time so I think that's kind of strange
through the same product and twice but I
liked it so I'm happy to have it again
yay this is a facial cleanser yeah I
think that's the same thing we got last
time pantene expert collection age defy
shampoo okay drugstore I'm not ever
happy to get drug store stuff in here
but I you know it's all good i'll try it
okay i wonder if there's a conditioner
in here too we'll see oh goodness energy
i predict these things now um alright
get enough beauty spots as i can predict
what's going next it's like magic okay
we'll go for and they're big samples are
really big hmm i have always wanted to
try products by eight to ten this is the
miracle leave-in light shampoo condition
hair trout towel dry spray products all
over hair and comb through who smells
really good so I'm excited to try this
if you have any experience with this
product let me know alright my camera
battery just died so i'm hoping that
everything continues I don't what's on
my camera battery i'll be dying when i'm
trying to open these tubes though it
feels a little something must have
stowed in here it feels a little oily
but this is an orally lacquer in haute
red and it's really pretty it's oily
though I wonder what spills in here whew
that just looks shiny and beautiful but
you love love love that excited about
that okay what's this this is a why the
F your best friends automatic eyebrow
pencil and a universal 20 it's got a
little slowly spoolie cool
rolls up I'm interesting why you know
it's a little hard but it's for eyebrows
it's not fry liner so it might be okay
zoom I can zoom in just a minute buddy
okay so so there is the tip and then
there is the swatch of it I think it's
going to be really nice it was a little
bit hard to put on let me show you see
how it doesn't go on real quickly and
then it gets darker so we'll see so it
looks like there's three more things in
here this is another lumen-a we had one
of these is a vitamin C with Arctic
cloudberry night cream so we got the day
cream last time and now we have the
night cream it actually I was looking
for a new day cream i've been using I'm
night great I was looking for a new
night cream because i've been using this
data cream as my night cream should now
i have your night cream um there's
nothing spectacular about the daydream
probably won't be anything for talk
about the night cream but you know we'll
do it anyway and I'm sure it'll work for
its purpose so this is by the brand
Moroccan oil and it is a body butter
which should be nice my hands are all
oily from whatever spilled in there okay
there we go got it okay so it's got the
little smells a little flower scented
marshmallows flowery sweetness and
there's the texture of it very very
thick but most body butters are pretty
thick feels nice a little oily no
exfoliating anything crunchy in there
yeah it's kind of oily I'm not sure
about this but it's Moroccan argan oil
so i guess you can kind of expect it to
be oily but it smells nice when you put
it on almost smells like suntan lotion
and the last thing in here is x / lodge
an illuminating primer oh I don't know
about an illuminating primer because I
like Matt looks I don't really like my
whole face to be illuminated so I'm not
sure about this one her Lodge primer and
it just looks like a cream it's very
strange because when I think of a primer
I think of something either like
silicone
aged or you know something that has a
completely different texture than a
moisturizer something it's a little
thicker so I don't know we'll try it so
that was the main tube and then here are
the bonus products which is always nice
they gave us bonus products last time
and they were awesome let's see what
this is boosted instant complexion
enhancer hydrate eliminates instant
wrist often refresh prime brightening
younger smoother awake Titan perfect for
everyday use generously applied to face
for a minute complexion boost instantly
Titan and brighten the appearance of
skin in seconds using the morning or
bare skin on their skin for best results
also amazing on leg shoulders and
decollete and if this big box with a
little teeny tiny thing in it well we'll
try it that's a scoop listen that that's
weird it feels crunchy in there weird
like they've got like the little mixing
balls if they I don't know if they still
put them in nail polishes but most nail
polish like it don't have a little
mixing bowl too many more weird it's
like lit really liquidy super liquidy
reviewed we'll try it you know we'll see
how it goes and as always I will put
anything that's fabulous or absolutely
horrible in my favorites and fails
videos and then this I'm just opening it
I don't even know what it is it's by
Dalton color cream lip gloss cool in
lisa lu not Lucy Liu lisa lu really
pretty packaging it's got a sparkle in
it so that's what that looks like I
don't know if the sparkles coming off
but it's pretty oh I just stuck my
finger like right in it holy moly okay
let me get some of that off I didn't
expect it to be so soft it looks like
it's going to come out pretty sheer tiny
bit of a peach tinge and a little
sparkle we put a little on interesting I
don't particularly like the pots for lip
lock so I feel like it's not as sanitary
but
it's very thick I probably too much on
to not sticky at all nice little taste
there look fruity so there it is on i
don't know if i had lip product on
already though so I don't know if you
can see it but and that is it for the
bonus products so that was cost forty
dollars um I don't know whether that was
worth that I don't know we got some
really good stuff things I'm most
excited about in here or the tarte
maracuja oil the it's a 10 miracle
leave-in light I'm excited to try that
and the nail polish excited about that
and actually the lip gloss I'm kind of
excited about so you know we'll see Edna
also i'm excited to try this the eyebrow
pencil I mean we did I think it's worth
forty dollars i think this much it
wasn't as good as the last one i think
that was worth well over forty dollars
but way better than the first one and i
don't see the little cart oh there's
something else in here there's something
else in the bonus products i forgot
didn't see this this is called knit fab
no needle fix it serum is what it looks
like it says it's nip + fab no needle
fix serum so i guess that's like plastic
surgery fast-acting cell active form
firms wrinkles power ausa lift tenses
and smooth skin I wonder who comes up
with all these terms these like you know
registered trademarks cell active and
also left who comes up with this stuff
plumping volumizing serum so I don't
know we'll try it will see I got some
pretty some deeper wrinkles on the
forehead so we'll see how those go oh I
didn't show you in here that it comes
with this this is what tells you what's
in the tube and then this
the new Beauty magazine and there's a
lot of good stuff in here but there's
also usually a lot of ads in here take
up about half the book especially in the
back I mean this whole back is all
plastic surgery ads so but I mean it
definitely has some really nice articles
it's a nice magazine so it doesn't have
about the referring a friend thing if
