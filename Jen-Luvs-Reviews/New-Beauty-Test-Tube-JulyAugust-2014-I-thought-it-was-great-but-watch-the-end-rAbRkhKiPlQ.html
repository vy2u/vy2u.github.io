no Beauty test tube I love my new baby
test too but I say that every single
video how much I really like the
subscription and then but sometimes it
does let me down and it makes me cry we
did have kind of a was it a bad one last
time I think it was just kind of like it
and one last time at the time for that
it was amazing I would say this gets
shipped bimonthly out of the six boxes
we get like two are amazing tour okay
and to Orleans so you know it's a
crapshoot with this one really and truly
you never know what you're going to get
in this thing it could be a bunch of
awesome full-size amazing this stuff or
it could be a bunch of little piddly
little samples that's not worth forty
dollars in my eyes so hit or miss oh
this box I actually get just for
shipping costs thanks to the wonderful
people who have subscribed using my link
this tube was paid for by the
subscription opening joyousness of this
person right here thank you so much for
signing up using my link I truly truly
appreciate it and yeah i only pay ten
bucks with us thanks to that person I
they got five dollars off their tube and
I got mine for free that's for any
single person that signs up for new
beauty test tube anybody signs up using
their link gets that deal if you're
interested in the five dollars off I
will just shooting I'll put the
directions on how to get the five
dollars off down below it's not a
discount code it's a weird process but
i'll put the information if you're
interested in that once you see what is
inside okay let me see you make sure i'm
in focus because focus is important in
the youtube video fang show this is the
way it looks inside the box and now i
open this as enjoy we hope you love the
products in this test tube and the first
thing I notice is we did not get a
little
AG you usually get a little bag of
travel sized products and that is not in
here so that kind of sticks cuz I don't
think we've ever gotten one without one
this is Z Juba and this is I don't know
why I keep busting into that accents
weird and this little magazine here has
descriptions of everything that's in
there which I don't look at unless I
absolutely need to and then say what is
in the beautiful tube this month okay
looks like it is packed to the top which
always makes me happy and we got the
something I've already gotten from new
booty testing before it is the melody
deep cleansing brightening foam cream by
la roche-posay and actually last time I
got this you guys told me how amazing
this was and I still haven't used it but
I am going to keep this because you guys
told me it's amazing i'm going to keep
this and actually try this because i
think new beauty is trying to tell me
something that I needed this product
okay next I say la la la biosilk okay
bye also coma therapy la la la la puppet
at lock and protect leave in treatment
love me some leave in treatments very
excited to have this and i do love
biosilk i do have like a frizziness
calming it's the clear one stop that I
absolutely loved by them so a very
excited to try that yeah and this looks
like a definite full-size product there
next up I see this little baggie bag
which I immediately I'm not super
excited about because whenever i see
anything that's like drugstore like
really drugstore like dove like 299 a
bottle I never get your all excited
about it because it's like well I can
just go to store my tune on and on and
try it but these are dove advanced hair
series oxygen moisture for fine flat
hair which is what i have so that's
really nice that it actually fits my
hair type that's wonderful I got a
shampoo and a conditioner so yes
I am excited to try it I'm just not
happy to get this in such an expensive
subscription box but I am happy to try
Oh Lou mean time freeze anti-aging CC
cream and I think we've got to do
happens when I got this some other time
maybe to test you sometimes sends repeat
things in case you haven't noticed I
think what I think I might have tried
like a sample of this because my mom is
telling me that I really really like
this product I think this I'm going to
pause I'm gonna look and I'm gonna come
right back I swear I think I've tried
this before I don't know I'm confused it
is in the shade medium I don't think new
Beauty test tube will ask you your skin
tone so let's see swatch today it blends
into my skin very very nicely I think I
remember this being a like medium
coverage but yeah I'm really excited
about this product and it cannot wait to
use it doesn't have it has actually kind
of a little bit about fruity scent to it
yeah it does just a little tiny bit and
yeah it feels nice on my skin very happy
about that okay they did send this to us
before this is the Revlon age-defying
wrinkle remedy line filler and I know
they send this before and I did not like
this so there's anybody that would like
to try this I would be happy to send it
to one of you what you're going to do is
you're going to comment down below that
you're interested in the red one
age-defying wrinkle remedy line filler
or just the line filler or the Revlon
thing or whatever you want to call it
and you have the chance of winning it
within 24 hours well about 24 hours ish
after this video goes live I will cut
off the giveaway i'll put a little
comment say the giveaway course in this
video is now closed a little blah and
then i will pick a winner and i will
ship it out to you whoever is the winner
it didn't only work for me it didn't do
anything for me but if you want to try
it i'll send it to you and you could try
it and hopefully it works for you ok and
if you have tried this and it did work
for you i would love to know more about
your skin type i won't you are things
like that so that i can know who this
does work for because we do not work
room right ok this one ooh
valley high shine liquid lipstick cool i
hope it's a color i will wear please be
a color i will wear oh it is a nice
little pinky color i can see this not
working well for just anybody either
because somewhat dark skin probably this
will look a little weird on unless it is
not very pigmented cranky cranky cranky
they always make you crank this thing
like fifty hundred times fifty hundred
how many thousand is that alright it
looks pretty sheer but it's such a light
color it's hard to tell yeah it's very
sheer it's got a little stick to it
should I put up my got lip product on
now I'll put on now I don't want to mess
up my lip thing I got going on I'm
wearing actually today that Jaclyn hill
rose hill whatever from whitening
lightning / they change your name to
Gerard cosmetics I'm not sure if that's
because a lot of people were like
whitening lemon we've been over promoted
on YouTube and that's why we're changing
our name they needed that change their
practical jig no this is the lamest
looking packaging there's a little
mirror I'm so off topic right now but
the little mirror is cute the light is
cute but this is the dumbest looking
packaging but what's worse I'm glad they
took off the stupid little smile though
the stupid little smile had to go low
whitening lightning then yeah they still
could have improved packaging a little
bit this cheesy white print out there
I'm definitely not high ends I need to
fix that they should just let that off
just left off the print laugh it off but
anyway so off topic anyway what I'm
trying to tell you is this a super sheer
and it feels a little bit sticky but we
will try it and I'm very thankful to
have it and I'm thankful that it as a
color that I will actually use and not
some crazed on okay and then the last
thing in here is all strivectin
oh my friend Mary Lynn is gonna be one
this she doesn't use this one this one
is get even brightening serum this is a
pretty good too i'm actually really
happy with that this stuff's expensive
how much is this stuff yeah the full
size of this is 1.7 fluid ounces in its
$89 this right here is worth the price
in the tube right here if you're paying
for the full price of this so yeah I'm
actually really happy with this to say
goodbye the discoloration and dark spots
with innovative serum that will leave
you with a smoother more even toned
complexion see this is the thing I don't
really have like spots and stuff I might
pass this to my mom even though I've
always wanted to try this try strivectin
stuff ever strivectin thing I've ever
gotten sense is something that isn't
really for me it bums me out well if my
mom says it's amazing i will let you
know i'm gonna pass this on to her oh I
want to draw it yeah it fights dark
spots I don't have dark spots yet thank
goodness and then this is actually
there's one more thing here this is a
grande facelift breakthrough finishing
serum the no toc solution for younger
looking skin this I will try anything
for wrinkles i will try cuz i got these
ugly little buggers up there that i hate
and i got some fine lines going on here

starting to get a little wrinkly down
here it's like okay I'm now officially
in my mid-30s I got some wrinkles on my
neck no good well I'm excited to try
that I'm glad that they put that in
there cool so in some way what we got we

that it's okay i'll survive on that have
enough good stuff in here to make up for
it we got the CC cream which is a good
thing we got the full size by was so
