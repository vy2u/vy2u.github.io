hello my friends I cannot wait to shoot
this video I just got off work and I got
packages on the door and I gotta open
them up because I have a feeling I got a
bunch of junk that I don't want but I'm
hoping that I'm pleasantly surprised so
let me show you think I got my
completely unwanted new Beauty test tube
after all your comments I decided I was
gonna cancel this I went on to my
account
and I cancelled my new Beauty test tube
a subscription and then when I looked in
my email in about four minutes before I
cancelled my subscription they had
shipped this to me so I realized that
the last one that I got they're supposed
to shut the ships every two months but
this it was the last one was actually
the April one and I had ordered it in
the end of April so they send it to me
anyway even though it was already out to
other people so anyway so I didn't get a
chance to cancel this one so I got it
anyway and then I got my very last
Beauty box five I had ordered a three
month subscription accidentally that's
another one I cancelled it
right after they recently so I'm
expected to get a bunch of junk I don't
want hopefully I will be pleasantly
surprised so I will get to find out
together so my camera totally just ran
out of room I hadn't started over and I
want to see was it to luminate vitamin C
age defying
