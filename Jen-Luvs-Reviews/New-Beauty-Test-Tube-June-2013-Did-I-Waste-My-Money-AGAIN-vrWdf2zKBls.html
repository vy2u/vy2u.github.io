please yes hello my friends I cannot
wait to shoot this video i just got off
work and i got packages on the door and
i got to open them up because i have a
feeling i got a bunch of junk that I
don't want but I'm hoping that I'm
pleasantly surprised so let me show you
think I got my completely unwanted new
Beauty test tube after all your comments
i decided i was going to cancel this I
went on to my account and I canceled my
new beauty test tube a subscription and
then well I looked at my email in about
four minutes before i cancel my
subscription they had shipped this to me
so I realized that the last one that I
got their supposed to shut every two
months but that it was the last one was
actually the april one and i had ordered
it in the end of april so they send it
to me anyway even though it was already
out to other people so anyway so i
didn't get a chance to cancel this one
so i got it anyway and then I got my
very last beauty box five I had ordered
the three-month subscription
accidentally that's another one I
canceled it right after they recent ride
so I'm expecting to get a bunch of junk
I don't want hopefully i will be
pleasantly surprised so i will get to
find out together so my camera totally
just ran out of room i hadn't started
over and I want to see was it too
luminate vitamin C age-defying
Arctic cloudberry radiant day cream

worth this time now I have to decide
whether I'm going to keep it for the
next I canceled it I can still go on and
reup for next time
