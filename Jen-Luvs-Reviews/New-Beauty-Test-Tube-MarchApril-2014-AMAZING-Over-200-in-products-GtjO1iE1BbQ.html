Beauty test tube I seriously every month
to get this i get so excited even though
lately it's been kind of letting me down
I haven't been as happy the value have
it hasn't been as good um but I still
get really excited and I've been staring
at this box for like five days waiting
for my filming day so that I can find
out what is in this box it's been
staring at me like open me you know you
want to open it it's like no I have to
wait for my subscribers but I'm gonna
open it now cuz i I just I need to open
it driving me bonkers this is how it
comes oh by the way just so you know I
do get these for just shipping costs
because I had some glorious wonderful
subscribers sign up for new Beauty test
tube using my referral link anyway that
signs up for new Beauty test you gets a
referral link and if someone signs up
using your link you get a box for our to
bow should say for just the shipping
costs so this month it is this person
who helps me to get this box so thank
you to you if you are interested in
getting your own new Beauty test tube I
will put my link down below you do
receive a discount on your tube if you
do use that link it's either five or ten
dollars i can't remember but i will put
the information down below okay let's
get into what's in the tube that's how
it looks I'm opening it now usually it's
got a pink bottom and it's green this
month that's how that looks very springy
and then we get the bonus products it
says Beauty to go and then let's see
what else is in here we get this has all
of the products in it it feels kind of
thin which always makes me nervous it
makes me think there's not a lot in here
but we shall see so this has all the
products in it so I'm not going to look
at it I'm going to put that there and
I'm going to get right into the tube and
we will save the beauty to go products
for and last
oh I think I see something in here my
heart just heard of beaten and I got the
chills and I see something in here I
already recognized it just by the side
of this product I think yes it is oh I'm
excited okay tart is very famous for
their blushes if you were not aware of
that this is in the shade frisky I'm
gonna say full-size blush i want to say
these are like 25 bucks apiece of course
i'm putting all the info there so you
know better than I do right now but oh
wow and this is a beautiful spring of
color I have maybe three tart blushes I
think two of them are full-size they
aren't they aren't super soft blushes so
you have to use a little bit more of a
dense brush to apply them on the or else
you won't get a lot of pigmentation but
I'm gonna stop gathered and just showing
you this oh it's got sparkle in it so if
you don't like sparkle this won't be for
you but ooh this one's pigmented this is
more pigmented than my other ones let us
watch oh I love it already let's do a
brush swatch so we can see what this
would look like applied to the cheeks
and this one is really pigmented okay I
use a soft brush so you can see how that
is this is the brush i usually use for
my tart blushes it's just an everyday
minerals flat top brush didn't really do
much different they're actually that
seems like it's not less pigmentation
let's try that again yeah I guess it's a
little more out now you guys can
probably see what I can but yeah just
really really pretty i'm looking forward
to trying that yeah i've never gotten a
tart blush they gave out that tart blush
the month before i started getting my
test tubes which is what made me sign up
for test tubes so let's see what's next
professional solutions pure science
better skin triple action vitamin c
antioxidant that sounds cool neat apply
this clean scam morning and night
allowed dry may be used as often as
needed so i'm assuming this is some kind
of skin solution i don't know much about
it i will read about it actually I will
look in the book because I am unfamiliar
with
a vitamin C antioxidant i'm unfamiliar
so I'm gonna try not to look oh my
goodness i'm not looking i can't i
already see things i cannot look because
i'm looking at all the other products
i'm not going to look I will look later
to see exactly what that does y'all
probably know better than I do I'm sure
some you know if people really people
that they beauty videos really
underestimate their subscribers and
their knowledge of beauty products
because y'all always know more than I do
a lot of people do what is this okay by
oxen idea vioxx idea the oxide a miracle
48 excellence gold face and body
treatment weird what do you do with this
thing oh this is look at that does not
look fun to me like that that looks and
not fun I know some of y'all like put in
fate things on your face like that but
that is not me so you put it on your
forehead and then you put it on your
chin so you're covered or I guess you
can put it in your bathtub you like heat
it up put it in some water and then put
it in your bathtub I don't know a very
confused so you shake the pouch two or
three times to mix equally highly cut
okay to mix the highly concentrated
ingredients so you wash your face relax
take the mask off oh I see so what you
do is you apply it to your face you
leave it on for 15 to 30 minutes and
then you take the remaining product and
you put it in your bathtub so that the
rest of the goodness of the mass goes
all over your body that is weird my
friend mary lynn loves face masks I
think she will have fun with this I'm
going to pass this on to her because
that's just weird I've never seen
anything like this before but its deadly
offense thing is just not my style I'm
sure a lot of you would love it okay
next thing I'm seeing is the it's a 10
miracle leave-in light and we have
gotten this in a new Beauty test tube
before but I am all out of it and I
loved it so I am happy to get another
one of these even though we have
received this product before it is like
a smoothing calming makes my hair shiny
kind of thing some people have told me
that the original one of these ways down
their hair I did not feel like this
version did this is actually my favorite
version of these products I've tried
keratin I've tried the regular and this
one this one's my favorite so really
happy to have another one of those a
simple sensitive skin cleansing facial
wipes I think I've heard good things
about these if i remember right let me
know if you've tried these because i
think and these are good ones i've never
tried this kind I didn't tell you it was
their cleansing facial wipes so their
makeup remover wipes really anxious to
try those I'm pretty sure these are good
yeah good stuff happy to have those okay
next we have why the F which I really
like perfect prep face primer and I'm
always all about trying new face primers
so very excited about that as well I
love the why the F a brow pencil it
reminds me of the Anastasia anastacio
whatever brow products the pencil just
Oh such a great product I don't think
I've ever disliked anything I've gotten
from YBF so very excited to try the
primer I've never tried that before so I
know we are way over the four dollar
subscription price at this point alright
hope in a jar I've heard bad things
about hope in a jar I are really bad
things I've heard bad things about the
smell I've never smelled this before
should I open it or should I give it
away oh I'm gonna keep it okay I'm gonna
open it because I can always use more
moisturizers no yeah it smells pretty
bad it's not looked pretty terrible okay
I'm still gonna try it though because
maybe it has maybe it's good maybe it's
good I don't know I'm gonna try it I'm
gonna give it a chance even though the
smell is quite funky won't you take me
to funky town hoping a job won't you
take me to next we have glam glow I've
heard really good things about glam glow
all of a sudden like I know it's been
around for a while but all of a sudden I
hear glam glow everywhere so this is
there youth mud tingle exfoliate one
word it's great the I they make up these
with tingle exfoliate exfoliate
treatment mask yes expect at a little
tastic tightening effect in 10 minutes
or less really anxious to try this it
looks like a relatively small sample but
I bet I could use this three or four
times very cool okay and I feel ok I
feel one more thing this is a grande
mascara last lash boosting
formula I'm always up for lash boosting
my lashes need a boost let me tell you I
don't know who makes it though so I'm
actually not going to open this I'm
going to save it because I have lots of
mascaras it but I way too many mascaras
open right now so I'm gonna save this
but it's actually try this no matter who
makes it I guess it's grande Grande GRA
nde sure excited about that so seriously
I think there's one there's something to
anything in here that I'm not excited
about I don't think that's ever happened
with the new Beauty test you where
there's only one thing I'm not excite
about oh I forgot about the the gotten
the go products very cool all right I
still don't know what this thing is yet
we'll find out about that in a minute on
the go products let's see what we got ok
this is a fighter
very excited about this I really like
the phyto brands I've always had really
good results with this except for one
thing I got I got a shampoo from them
once and it was like straight water I am
working on an empties video I'm
collecting my trash so I'll tell you
more about that in that video coming up
make sure you subscribe so you don't
miss that but the shampoo is terrible
because it was like literally like it's
like water like liquid going to man I
never had a ship like it it's so weird
and that was by the same company but
everything else I've tried by the them
is been wonderful so anxious to try that
wish they'd given us the conditioner
though I always like to have the
condition along with the shampoo okay
and then this this stuff I know is mad
expensive because they've given us
hydroxatone stuff in the past and it was
like stupid expensive and this is an
instant wrinkle filler now I've had very
bad luck with wrinkle fillers so I'm
curious to know whether this will work
because I know hydroxatone is like super
duper expensive and this is huge like I
can imagine this is gonna last forever
so really excited because I do have
these guys up here that drive me bonkers
and I'm editing for hours looking at
these wrinkles and it's like oh so
hopefully this helps and maybe you won't
see wrinkles in the next video except
for when i express myself okay next I
see stem cells superfood facial oil by
rodeo rodeo rodeo I don't know um and
that's just a little foil pack little
sampling guy gently massage onto a
cleanse face and neck instant results
for dehydrated skin I don't have
dehydrated skin but I will pass this on
to someone who does and then the last
thing there's one more thing in here and
this is the Hava time to hydrate
essential day moisturizer and I'm always
up for those so so are you guys I'm
keeping everything this time usually I
give away a lot of stuff whenever I open
things if I already have something if I
feel like it's something I won't use
I'll give it away my subscribers sorry
guys I'm keeping everything this time I
really feel like I can use everything I
hope you're not mad at me for not giving
you anything but I have lots of
