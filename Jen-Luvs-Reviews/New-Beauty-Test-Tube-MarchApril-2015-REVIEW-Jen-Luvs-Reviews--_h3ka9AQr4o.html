hello my friends welcome to the March
May April February what month is this
welcome to the February new Beauty test
you this is February and March is a bi
monthly subscription new Beauty test
tube is about $40 a month including
shipping but I do get this for just
shipping cost which is about nine
dollars thank you to the people who have
signed up for new Beauty test tube that
have emailed me asking for me to hook
them up I think you get like five or $10
off your first tube and then I get a
tube free a well just for shipping cost
so this tube is courtesy of this person
thank you very very much for signing up
and contacting me so that I could get
this tube for just shipping cost so new
Beauty test tube I have been quite
unhappy with for a very long time has
actually been exactly a year since I
have been happy with the tube so last
month was a little bit better and I was
hoping that this one would be even a
little better than last one now this one
is okay let me just show you what's in
the tube okay first thing that I wanted
to tell you about is that it came with a
$40 gift card to a place called
hellofresh and let me tell you I'm
addicted I'm absolutely addicted to
hellofresh I will put my referral code
down below because if every three
referrals I get a free box show that
would be amazing but I just want to tell
you why I like this hello fresh is a
food delivery service and it is
basically its recipes and then they give
you all of the ingredients you need in
order to make the recipes so it is
actual cooking like you have to cut the
onions you have to you know really put
everything together so personally I love
cooking but I don't have time to go to
the grocery store I don't have time to
well my husband usually does a lot of
grocery shopping but in order for me to
tell him what I need I have to like
research recipes and then I don't even
know whether it's gonna be any good or
not so this way I know that it's gonna
be good recipes because I've now this is
I've done two weeks now so I've tried
six different meals all six have been
amazing I get two meals and that feeds
me and my two kids
my three-year-old and my six-year-old if
my husband was
I would get the foreperson meal and then
have a little bit of leftovers it really
is just enough like for the two people I
think it would be just enough for two
adults like it's conservative so just so
you know but things that we had the
first week we had this parmesan crusted
chicken with tangy balsamic potato salad
that was amazing then we had the spicy
poblano Bolognese this was amazing the
kids didn't like it but I liked it I
left the spices out the spice was the
poblano pepper and I did not put that in
at all and then the pan-roasted salmon
the kids destroyed this one
it was pan-roasted salmon with mustard
butter bean salad they weren't a big fan
of the butter beans we're not a big bean
family but they liked the vegetables
that were in there it was zucchini and
sugar snap peas and they really liked
that so out of this week they like the
chicken and they like the salmon and
then it seems like they were getting two
out of three for the kids last week we
had something called bangers and
cauliflower mash it was amazing so if
you're the kind of person like me who
doesn't have time to shop for groceries
doesn't up but wants to cook then this
might be something you might need to use
my referral link I think you get a
discount too but I'll put all that
information down below but anyway okay
so let's get into everything I keep all
the things that I'm trying in here so
that I don't forget to try them and now
I have a ridiculous and my stuff in here
it doesn't begin here okay the first
thing was this YBF and it's a mechanical
eye pencil in shrimp
charming champagne this is glittery
glittery glittery so it's a nice base
for eyeshadows but it's really glittery
let me show you it's really shimmery I
don't know if you that's even doing
injustice but it's super duper uber
shimmering I feel like this is even too
much for a brow bone highlight like
unless you're doing it just right at the
edge of the brow bone high brow bone and
then blending out it's super shimmery
I'd use it for an inner corner highlight
I tried it all over my lids and I didn't
like the way that it looked but this is
not my favorite product it's okay I'm
glad I tried it but I'm not a huge fan
of this I don't know how much I'll be
using it oh I left something in the
bathroom alright next up was a huge win
for me a huge huge win and that was the
Keywest aloe gentle gentle aloe facial
cleanser with 30% aloe I love this stuff
I was so excited like um you know you
get a cleanser and it's like okay it's
gonna be cleanser this is seriously like
right now my favorite cleanser I was
really into the the hot cloth cleanser
that I got from Birchbox I ended up
ordering a full-size I still really
liked that one but I like this one even
better I feel like it doesn't dry out my
skin if I act my skin's it doesn't dry
my skin if I accidentally get it in my
eyes then it doesn't hurt you know like
how some cleansers can really burn this
one I don't have super sensitive eyes
but like if someone accidentally seeps
into like the corners of my eyes it
doesn't hurt it does take a double dose
in order to take my eye makeup off but I
don't mind that that doesn't bother me
at all but I love the way this stuff
feels and I am a huge huge huge huge
huge fan of this it also smells amazing
it smells like kind of like lemonade
like lemon candy almost like lemon heads
smells really really good and oh my
goodness love love love love love that
okay next up I'll show you this next
this here is the lumia brighten house
vitamin C day cream this is too hardcore
for me it's too hardcore for me it's
very very very thick and it's too
moisturizing for me it overloads my skin
makes my skin feel greasy I am NOT a fan
I have like blue mean face creams in the
past I do not like this one just because
it's too intense if you have dry skin
this may be better for you next okay
then we got some drugstore hair stuff
okay I have not used some of this stuff
in here
some of the drugstore hair stuff because
a lot of the drugstore hair stuff does
not do well with my hair see if this was
if this was all that was in the tube was
the things that were in the magazine I
would have been a little irritated but
because they gave us an extra then I'm
cool with it okay but they gave us nice
sizes too this is the John Frieda Frizz
Ease this is the shampoo and the
conditioner the shampoo does have sodium
laureth sulfate so I do not use a truck
but I do not use but I try not to use
products with sulfates on my hair I
really feel like it dries out my hair it
strips the color out of my hair like it
just does not agree with me so I have
that I have
conditioner I have not used either one
of those they were probably honestly be
passed along to my mom and then also the
beyond smooth frizz immunity primer and
I haven't used this yet but I wanted to
show you I figured up we could do like a
little first impression because I
haven't put any product in my hair at
all and I thought we could try it
together because you can see my hair is
a little bit on the frizzy side just a
little bit just put that much that might
even be a little too much we'll see
we'll see what it does to my hair again
there's no product in my hair at all not
even heat protectant nothing just
straight out of the shower air dry ok
you guys can probably see better than I
can weather that did anything or not I
don't know it doesn't look as anything
to me but y'all can tell me I'm looking
in this little teeny tiny little mater
it looks this big to me from where I'm
at so you guys probably tell better than
I can as far as whether you think that
did anything we also got this John
Frieda 7 day of volume in shower
treatment with protein and keratin okay
it just says luxurious volume seven-day
volume in shower treatment transform
fine fine hair for up to seven days with
this revolutionary thickening treatment
and I did not try the shet and I'm sad
that I didn't try because this is
something I could definitely use with my
fine hair so I will have to get back to
you on that if it's awesome it will be
in a my seasonal favorites which will be
coming up in a few weeks or so alright
and that was it for what was in the
actual magazine but now let me show you
some of the things they threw an extra
one thing they threw an extra was this
Mally lip gloss and I do like the Mallee
lip glosses they're not my favorites I'm
not a big fan honestly of the like the
little brush applicator on lip glosses
so that's the shade they're definitely
I'm not sure how that would look on
someone of a deeper skin tone if someone
my shade or someone a little fairer than
me that probably looks pretty nice I did
use this once and I can put it on over
this lip product that I'm currently
wearing just to see how it transforms it
a bit let's say if it just glosses it up
or if you can actually see it
mmm I'm not using a mirror I'm just
going by it this is like the no mirror
makeup challenge right now did that make
any different I can always use nudie
glosses to put into my pocket or my
purse or whatever so I'm not upset about
this it does have a very faint smell no
stickiness at all where time is typical
so I am happy to have it not super
excited about it but it's a nice product
they also put in a pack of these we have
received these in new Beauty test tube
before these are the tantowels it says
look good naked
and I have used these and I did like it
a lot so I was really thankful to get
these it comes with five packets and you
just take the towelette out it's almost
like when those towelettes you get at
like a crab house or something where you
know you got to wipe your hands off
afterward like a little Red Lobster or
whatever you have the little towelette
it's like that but it's bigger and it
makes your skin darker so again not
really appropriate I think for my darker
skin friends but I'm thankful to have it
and I think people with my skin tone
people that enjoy having a darker skin
tone in the summer time would be very
thankful to have this but I don't think
this would be a product that everyone
would probably enjoy it says fair to
medium skin tones I haven't heard that
these are very nice though for evening
out skin tone if you are of a deeper
skin tone that you can use these to just
even out your tone which is and the last
thing they threw in was this smile
actives tooth whitening pen and okay
this first of all it came out when I
pulled out of the box it had product
leaking out here which was not happy to
see and also no matter what I do product
leaks out of the top so I've never
actually rolled this and clicked this up
product just continually seems to be
coming out which does not make me happy
as far as the actual whitening of it
I've used I use it for about a week and
didn't see any difference it might take
longer than that some of this stuff does
take longer are the ingredients are
water then hydrogen peroxide then
glycerin peg 60 hydrogenated castor oil
and then some other things that I'm not
sure what they are the flavor of it the
taste of it when it's in your mouth is
not terrible it does have a cold
sensation when I put it on my teeth
which is a little bit uncomfortable but
I think that's just the nature of these
kinds of products
when I purchased this no I was happy to
see it though at least it's something
different to get you know is this kind
of like a myth for me personally
especially since the product keeps
rolling out o in the directions it's
said to just wipe it off your teeth and
then when I did that I guess I swallowed
some of the product and I got a really
bad stomachache so after that I started
rinsing my mouse that might also be why
it wasn't quite as effective is because
I wasn't um I wasn't doing I wasn't
leaving enough product on you know I'm
saying like I think you're supposed to
leave it on and then wipe off most of it
but then I think some of it may maybe
it's supposed to stay on your teeth
longer I don't know but it gave me a
stomach ache so I wasn't gonna go
through that again so that might have
compromised the you know the using of
the product and whether it actually
worked or not I don't know okay and one
thing about new Beauty test tube is you
have to remember it's a beauty sampling
program so you're it's supposed to help
you try new things and one of my biggest
gripes about new Beauty test tube is
they were sending a lot of repeat
products which means that I'm not trying
new things and some of the products they
were repeating were things that I didn't
like the first time I tried them so it's
getting very disappointing so for here
the only thing that I got that was the
same as before was the tans house I've
gotten a Mallee lip gloss like this
before but it was in a different shade
everything else is brand new for me
drugstore wise we got you know the
shampoo sample the conditioner sample
and the the hair whatever whatever this
is the the frizz immunity primer there
we also got the 7-day from John Frieda
the seven-day volume and then the Lumine
is a drugstore even though it's a little
bit more of an expensive drug store the
rest are more I guess high-end where
we've got the Mallee lip gloss the Key
West aloe the YBF the pen and the tans
house so I mean is this worth $40 I
don't know if you count the experience
of opening it I mean for these here I
don't think these are worth more than a
dollar a dollar each so three dollars
for all three this one here another
dollars to four dollars we'll say two
dollars on this little tiny sample of
this even though I didn't really like it
we'll get so give it a to dodge because
I would have paid two dollars to try it
and then
yes I would pay four dollars for this
because I loved it this I would pay
seven for this this here I pay another
six for this this here five I guess and
then this here I would pay eight or nine
dollars for this maybe unless es ten is
five towelettes I would pay two bucks
apiece we'll say ten for this so it does
that add up to $40.00 I can't calculate
that fast in my head you'll be able to
see it there and decide for yourself
what you would pay for these things and
whether it's worth 40 you feel like
newBeauty test-tube is going in the
right direction but I still don't think
they're quite there yet as far as value
when you compare them to GlossyBox
boxycharm PopSugar must have I don't
feel like this is even close to where
those subscription boxes are I think
they stop a lot of work to do but new
beauty you're moving in the right
direction and makes me happy that we're
trying at least trying some new products
