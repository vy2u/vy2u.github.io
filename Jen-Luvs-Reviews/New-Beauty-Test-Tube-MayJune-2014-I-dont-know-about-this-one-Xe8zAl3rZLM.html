Beauty test tube oh this is one of my
favorite subscriptions because I
literally never know what I'm going to
get except for that I will probably get
some repeat products of things that I've
gotten in other new Beauty jazz tubes
but other than that I never know what
I'm gonna get I get there could be a
hundred and fifty dollars worth of stuff
in here and there could be sixty dollars
worth of stuff in here it is so
incredibly unpredictable but one thing
that keeps me subscribed is the fact
that so many of you well I got down to
my last one blast referral and that was
miss Denise Denise was my last referral
for my last new beauty test tube and I
was thinking about canceling it because
it is so inconsistent until the last
tube when like eight of you subscribed
to it using my link so now I'm going to
be getting new Beauty test tube forever
because now I only have to pay for
shipping for it if you get a referral
you only have to pay shipping which is
about nine bucks now this is advertised
it like 2995 but that's not counting the
nine dollars in shipping so really what
this comes down to is about a forty
dollar subscription price a little bit
under honestly I will tell you my
friends this is a very inconsistent box
it is a gamble every time you get this
so if you're you don't have 40 bucks to
just throw away I do not recommend this
box but if you hit a good one if you
pull that lever on the slot machine you
could end up with some pretty amazing
stuff in this so it's really whether you
want to take a gambler or not and that
is my honest opinion about this service
so let's just go ahead and jump into
what is in here this does come every two
months so this is the may/june tuba and
this is how it looks on the inside enjoy
we hope you love the products in this
test tube and discover favorites along
the way it always says the same thing oh
let's rip into it
we got okay so the two of this month has
an orange bottom and very appropriate
for may it also comes with these new
beauty to go sometimes these are
full-size things in here sometimes
sample size and then it does come with
this magazine and this has all of the
products with the full-size prices and I
do not look at this until after I'm done
filming unless I'm completely confused
about something that I got and I need to
look it up so we'll put that over on the
side also with the subscription if you
enjoy new Beauty magazine it comes with
a subscription new beauty magazine did
you automatically get shipped to your
house sometimes it comes in the box
sometimes it comes at other times looks
like it's going to come at another time
for this particular to yuba so here is
the tube we're going to go ahead and
open it okay so the first thing I see is
something that says Beauty choice
product new Beauty winner and it says
intel a shade original or matte finish
so is this some kind of foundation is it
a powder I do not know let's open it and
find out whoa that is idina done a
little sample there okay matches every
skin tone every time do you see how
small these are these are tiny they're
super innovative baby sighs and I'm not
even sure what they do oh they're tinted
moisturizers so that's like two uses for
each cuz I am uber spoiled by my
subscription services when I get little
itty bitty samples like this I'm kind of
like oh but maybe it's amazing i don't
know we'll have to try it and find out
next up i see a brio geo the RI o GE oh
don't despair repair deep conditioning
mask and i can always use some deep
conditioning mask let me tell you
speaking of deep conditioning mask since
i haven't done any reviews lately I got
the deep conditioning repair masque bomb
stuff by the bomb and it is the bomb it
is amazing it's like oh my gosh is
amazing so next time the bomas on
hautelook check out their deep
conditioning repair masque oh I'm in
love with it it smells so good and it
works really really well so that's a
side note but anyway I'm anxious to try
this one and see if it's just as good is
for dry damaged or camelid chemically
treated hair which is
all of the above for me at this point I
haven't gotten my hair done since
October look at the grace can you see
the grace they are flying one up like
what they are growing in and taking over
so yeah it needs to be done just been
too busy hasn't been a priority you know
I'm saying ever get in those kind of
situations I need to stop rambling so
that is in here looks like I probably
get maybe five or six uses out of this
excited about that idea of pretty thin
hair so I'll have to use a lot of that
whoo macadamia natural oil flawless
cleansing conditioner 6in1 cleansing
conditioner cool i love macadamia
products actually no i can't say that i
love their repair masque i do like their
masks there was one product i tried for
them with did which was just kind of odd
for me uh so i don't remember what it
was though oh sorry about that but there
was something that was kind of like oh
it was the oil it was the wheel their
their oil you know stuff it was just ok
for me um but we'll try this we'll see
how it goes and it looks like it is a
full-size cleanses and conditions cool
reduces blow dry time provides style
control so very excited to try this and
their products typically smell amazing
so looking forward to trying that and
then next I see mmm ubi have about four
of these things and this isn't worth to
me giving away this teeny tiny little
sampler else i would give it to you i'll
probably pass this along to somebody at
work it's basically like a neosporin
kind of situation from japan next up I
see something it's called it says cobalt
oh this is a Mallee shadow stick they
have a lot of nally products and new
Beauty test tube which I do not complain
about I do enjoy their eyeliners do not
have not enjoyed I got a blush bronzer
highlight from them and absolutely hated
it I think it was just that particular
product because I've heard really good
things from reliable sources about how
wonderful those are this is very dark
and it is an eye shadow so mmm we'll
find some use for this but it is really
pretty very pigmented and it blends so
that's nice that it blends out very cool
maybe doing a little smoky smoky in the
corner maybe a little lower lashline
action
yeah so this will be put to good use
I've never tried one of their eye shadow
sticks so anxious to see the where time
on that creasing all of that good stuff
okay next there's looks like there's two
more products in here this is tantowel
look good naked a soft hand towel at
half body application for face and body
theater medium skin tones which I am a
fair to medium skin tone so that's very
convenient I would feel sad if someone
got this that was not fair to medium you
know just because this doesn't work for
everybody you know uh htn tell and but
it only says a half body what do I do
with the other half of my body a half
body have really the only gonna let
they're gonna they're gonna really give
me something it's only gonna help me
with half my body or oh so it comes with
all of these uh huh so it's one two
three four five halves 5ab so that
includes so it's two fools and a half so
weird so weird you know it I understand
for but I don't understand five I don't
know I don't know but we'll try it i've
never tried tantowel I've seen them on
hautelook quite a bit and anxious to see
how these work if you've tried these
please let me know because I don't want
to be orange so if you have experience
with this and it's not good please let
me know because you know being orange is
a bad thing and then here we have I
think I got this before from them yep
Jurgens BB body i think i did get this a
new beauty tested before and i have not
tried it yet you lovely lovely wonderful
people there are some wonderful people
explained to me that this will be really
nice on the legs you know to kind of
cover up and varicose veins or you know
little bumps or anything this would be
really nice in the spring summer you
know when the shorts are starting to
come out and skirts and things I think
that'll be nice and in you know I
haven't again I haven't tried it yet it
hasn't really been warm enough for that
but I will keep you updated on this
because it's a BB cream for your body so
that's very creative and interesting and
the last thing left is
silica gel which will be thrown away
because it says specifically not to do
anything with it but throw it away and
definitely do not eat it so that will
not you know I'll take care of that
don't you worry silica gel creators I
will make sure that gets thrown away so
that is it for the actual tube nothing
in here that actually super excites me
but let's look in the bonus products the
new beauty to go products and see if
there's anything exciting in here we got
the Tuscan honey by coming out Backman
all right through it sorry okay Camille
back then I just got in what was it
Birchbox I got a Camille Backman the
monarch butterfly one which is my
favorite I got that in there and now I
this one is the the Tuscan honey and
this one smells really nice too and i
absolutely love Camille Beckman's
lotions and there's such super wonderful
people over there I actually emailed
back and forth with the daughter of the
woman who started Camille Backman and
she is just such a sweetheart and that
does smell really good it's what you
would imagine it's got a honey snow but
a little bit of a floral in there and
just beautiful and one thing I love that
I said in that other video as well about
Camille Beckman is that they really
their products really seep into your
skin without leaving your skin feeling
oily so huge huge fan of Camille Beckman
products and very excited to have that
and then this here is a steal of
skincare oh cool face the day
moisturizing gel cream awesome I've
never tried any stila skin care so very
excited to try that cool yes let's see
usually they have some little packet e
things in here total refresh cooling
body Claus this will be nice in the
summer time when I'm feeling all sweaty
and nasty and I need to be refreshed new
with powder silk technology that
terminology always cracks me up whenever
they have things like that so very
excited to try this and it's by ban a
convenient way to feel instantly
refreshed anytime anywhere after
exercising at work or on the road so
really happy to try that I've never
heard of that and then this says
oops face SI o TZ cots face coat space
caught space healthier sunscreen lightly
tinted sheer matte finish neat and it's
just a one you one time use SPF 40
broad-spectrum uva UVB UVB which is very
very useful and that is it for the new
beauty test tube so let me just give you
a quick summary about things that I'm
excited and not excited about Jerkins
body BB cream could do without tan
towels hopefully they're amazing anxious
to try those the macadamia flawless hair
stuff anxious to try that hair mask
anxious to try that very excited about
the Camille Beckman lotion very excited
to try to steal a skin care cuz I know
nothing about that the IntelliJ if it's
amazing i'll be fun to try but I can't
see myself getting a really good idea
out of that little teeny tiny tube not
so excited about the Mallee just because
it's not a you know the dark blue but I
unhappy to have and I'll definitely try
it the coats or cots I the sunscreen
very happy to have that sample and then
the Refresh will definitely use that so
oh and this you be I could totally do
with FX I got a bunch of those things
and it smells horrible it's got like the
worst like so freaked orrible nasty
smell Oh smells awful but you know put
anyway I'll pass along somebody overall
I am happy with my new Beauty test tube
there's nothing that I'm like wow oh my
gosh this is totally worth 40 bucks you
know nothing that really was like Bob am
and my face awesomeness but I am I do
think that it was worth the forty
dollars do I think it was worth more
than forty dollars not really you know I
probably monetarily it is worth more
than forty dollars but you know not
really my favorite tube of all time but
definitely definitely not the worst so
