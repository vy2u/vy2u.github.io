new Beauty test tube I love getting
these things first started off with new
VHS you've absolutely hating it it is a
very expensive subscription it is forty
dollars a month and my first tube was
atrocious it was awful it was like I was
crying almost in the video but each time
i've gotten it since then i have liked
it even more each time i do want to let
you know that i have an opportunity for
a five dollar off code anyone who
subscribed to new beauty test tube can
give five dollars off to anyone who you
give a referral to and then i get a free
tube so I want to thank this person here
I've lost track of who i'm on i know all
the peoples names that have gotten me
free tues but I I don't know which one
I'm on right now so I thank you to this
person for getting me this free tube I
do have to pay for the shipping which i
think is like 9 bucks so if you are
interested in getting the five dollars
off of new Beauty test tube you're just
going to send me an email with your
email address and then I send your email
address new you test you and they send
you an email that says you know how to
get your five dollars off so if you're
interested in that just shoot me an
email at Jen loves reviews @ gmail.com
alright let's go ahead and without
further ado let's open this thing off
because I am too inside and all right
let's see that's the way it comes
packaged just beautiful thank you for
being part of the test tube community
you know I don't feel like there is a
test tube community at least not that I
found but I appreciate that they thanked
me for being a part of something that I
didn't know actually existed okay so
here we are going to open up this tissue
paper and the first thing I see is that
we got some bonus items i'm going to
save those for last and i'm going to
show you we got ooh we got a candle it's
by vote evo icy blue pine I'm not a big
pine tree sent fan but my husband is so
I bet he will like this oh yeah he's
gonna love this he loves any um clean
crisp smells and this definitely smells
clean
Chris go I am very happy to have it oh
right let's get into the tube this is
the way the tube looks it also comes
with this this has all of the products
in it i'm not going to look at that yet
unless i need to and this says as a test
tube member you still get subscription a
new beauty magazine they will send this
separately so that's cool that works it
says you get it four times a year so i
guess this is my off month because i
think we got it last time so i will be
getting this probably next month oh I
forgot to tell you a new Beauty test
tube comes every other month not every
month so that kind of makes the forty
dollar price tag more like a twenty
dollar a month and you do get
considerably more products in your
beauty test tube than you do in the
ten-dollar or twenty dollar a month um
subscription please don't spill on me
beautiful and it is packed to the top
whoa alright so what did we get first
thing we got was an exfoliant by go
therapeutics refresh facial polish turn
box for a special gift to reveal visit
their website is probably a discount I
am assuming and it is a 2 B 2 B and you
get exactly one ounce which is I think
whenever I get one else i'm always happy
especially for any kind of sample
products i feel like one ounce is a
significant amount of product to be able
to try something so i'm really happy
about that it has mahoba beads borage
oil and acai acai I never know how to
say that oil and it's a facial scrub I
am looking forward to trying that but i
will let you know and my monthly
favorites video of any of these things
are amazing or horrible if they're just
mediocre you'll never see them again
next up we got a little tiny vaseline
lip therapy cute and it's called rosy
lips and it is already open a little
oops oh it's already open pretty much
all the way I have a feeling that was
just in packaging or something it just
got job job somewhere I'm not stressed
out about that doesn't smell too much I
think they're trying to jump on that
that rose bomb kind of feeling I'm gonna
put it on cuz i have a mat that Matt
knew I have on this new revlon
colorburst matte balm in sultry on my
lips right now so it's very much so I'm
just gonna go and put this on that's
actually quite nice it's not way late
like Vaseline products typically are if
you saw my Vaseline kool-aid experimento
pinterest Buster saying you'll know how
much I hated the feel of Vaseline on my
lips but this doesn't feel like that
it's just very smooth very nice yeah
it's got still has the petrolatum as the
number one ingredient but it doesn't
feel slimy like Vaseline typically does
that's kind of cool and it's really cute
to put in your purse or your jacket
pocket or whatever all right next up we
got a straw strivectin Holy Ghost Jolie
they just went all out this this month
I'm get even brightening serum
exfoliation accelerates skin tone
appears brighter pigmentation normalizes
dark spots visibly fade now I don't
really have these problems with my skin
so I may either put this in my giveaway
box or give this to a friend because I
don't want to waste this on my skin that
doesn't really need this even though
this looks like an absolutely amazing
product next we got a glycerin hand
therapy french vanilla hand lotion and I
am actually just starting to run out of
one of my hand lotions so I'm definitely
one open this and keep this oh that
smells amazing it smells like a cupcake
to me vanilla cupcake comes out very
thick mmm that feels nice I like that
stuff whoo this is by Camille Beckman
cool I like this stuff I've never heard
of this and I really like it you mean I
do like liudmila mean as a drugstore
brand but I've loved everything that
I've gotten from Lou mean time freeze
anti-aging CC cream yeah I love me some
CC cream oh so excited and it's in
medium so what I'll probably have to do
with this is mix it with something
that's a little bit too light which is
fine with me yeah oh no it actually
looks good with my skin tone look at
that sweet love that so far matches my
skin tone nicely looking forward to this
Wow an S on um sunscreen SPF 20 it says
for all skin types very very very cool
okay we got a little package from dove
and this is something i don't really
like to see a new be tested I wouldn't
have picked these up but last time I
said that it was john frieda hair
shampoo and conditioner stuff and I
loved it so maybe I might be wrong on
this nutrient nutritive solutions daily
moisture conditioner and shampoo and
that's what that looks like and it looks
like it does have sodium laureth sulfate
and I have color treated hair so I'll
have to make sure that i am not supposed
to use this I'm sure these will go to a
good home to somebody than I know give
it to my mom I'm going to go see my mom
today so I'll bring these to my mom
molton brown london pink peppered
nourishing body lotion see I don't mind
getting one lotion but getting to
lotions I think that's a little much
smells good smells a little I don't know
a little fruity you see it's hard to
smell cuz I have the other lotion on me
Oh pink pepper pod I said pepper ring I
was waiting for the peppermint but it's
not it's pink pepper pod whatever in the
world pepper pot is I don't know it
smells pretty good kind of smells a
little grandma a little grandma but
that's okay maybe I'll give it to my
grandma I bet you she would really like
this her name is June and then this is
the last thing and this is john frieda
frizz-ease straight fixation smoothing
cream I loved the john frieda products
that i got last time I think I thought
those actually my Ipsy bag but I'm
looking forward to trying this because
now John Frieda is in the category of
good brand names so i am looking for
trying this my hair always needs
anti-frizz make sure it there's nothing
crazy happening do anything crazy
happening right now a little bit always
always oh wait i still have my um my
bonus products and usually this is
packed full of stuff it doesn't look
like it is this time I've got a smooshed
john frieda three days straight for
curly three days straight for curly hair
I don't have curly hair I've wavy hair
but i'm sure i could try it and see oh
okay so it's kind of like my it's a 10
miracle leave-in line I have a ton of
different ones of these come so i will
definitely try this the john frieda
version of it and see what I think about
that one other thing a little foil
packet of stem cells superfood facial
oil targets dehydration and fine lines
for an instant glow sure we'll try a
little faux pack that's ok this is the
bonus item so it's all good but over
all for forty dollars i don't know as
far as the way i like to grade a
subscription service is whether i would
have personally gone out and purchased
the items so overall would i have
purchased forty dollars worth of stuff
out of here probably not i probably
would not have purchased this because i
have lots of these things definitely
would not have purchased these shampoos
would not have purchased the strivectin
even though i know a lot of people
probably this would work better for them
but personally i would not purchase that
the vaseline i would never purchase but
i'm very thankful to have so we'll put
this in the keith category john forget
of frizzies I probably never would have
tried this um if I didn't get it just
now but I'm looking forward to trying it
so we'll say save that one really really
like this lotion so we'll save that one
CC cream definitely this was actually my
favorite thing in the box and it's a
drugstore product but I'm excited about
it the exfoliant I probably wouldn't
have purchased but I'm happy to have it
this lotion I probably never would have
bought so this will go in here and the
candle my husband and I you know we have
the same bank account he probably would
have bought this so we'll keep this out
as far as something that probably would
have been purchased so overall for forty
dollars this is probably what I would
have bought I don't think that this
month was worth the forty dollars
usually they include more makeup
products this time they only included
one which bums me out but I think that
this tube would have been amazing for
some people it wasn't amazing for me
just because of my personal preferences
but overall I'm very thankful to have it
i'm thankful to have these products here
