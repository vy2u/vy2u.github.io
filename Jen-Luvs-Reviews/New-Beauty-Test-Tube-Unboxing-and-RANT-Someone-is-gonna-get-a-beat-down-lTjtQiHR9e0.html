to do any more box opening videos but I
have to do one for this because it's a
new box and I'm super excited about it
and it is the new Beauty test tube I've
heard so many good things about this
subscription service that I just I
canceled beauty box 5 and I got this one
instead I know this one was a lone one
beauty marks 50 I also canceled my
goodies box so I'm hoping they kind of
even out this one I'll put the price
layer of how much I paid for this
because I don't remember but I know it
was more than beauty box 5 and goodies
put together so hopefully I'm really
hoping it's worth it i'm crossing my
fingers because you never know about
these things but this is the way it
comes and then it comes with this here
and it says the ultimate product
sampling program and it's got oh it's
got the products and I don't want to see
so it's got the products in here i'm not
going to look whoa huge thick magazine
hopefully there's some good stuff in
here maybe some coupons wouldn't that be
nice victory over aging skins a lot of
ads in here it seems but i guess all
beauty magazines kind of have a lot of
ads but yeah so i'm going to set this
over here i'll look at that later and
get to what's in the test tube so
excited oh please be good please be good
please be worth it i will cry if it is
not worth it okay so first thing I'm

about this is I'm gonna cry I'm gonna
cry blowout spray okay please I really I
hope I find something amazing in here
because I was really expecting more
beauty product more beauty products is
expecting more makeup products here
because they got a full size tart blush
once and that's what I wanted okay
luxurious volume this little tiny find a
full blowout spray you're supposed to
get full size samples I don't have any
full-size samples yet i don't believe
face wraps i hate these things oh these
are going my friend mary lynn co if you
if your follow me on keek you got to
meet Mary Lynn today it's a facial mask
I don't use these another one I'm not
happy about this I'm not happy more skin
care june jacobs skin care for piyah
purifying enzyme mask I don't really use
mass i'll try it but don't really use my
clear scalp hair therapy another one so
we got two of these they're the same
thing are you kidding me this is the
makeup we get this is it YBF these lip
glosses little lip glosses you can see
I'm like slouching because I'm so upset
about this look at this smells good
smells nice feel sticky they look like
they're the same thing they're like the
same color oh I'm disappointed I was so
looking forward to this I'm not actually
going to physically cry but I'm not
happy all right so let me swatch these
for you it is an beach berry so it's
pretty sheer and then this one is in oh
they're both in BGR they're the exact
same stinking thing two of the same
color so we got two of these we got two
of these we got two of these and then we
got one each of these so overall we got
three four five six seven products so I
guess that's pretty good to get seven
things to try compared to a sample
system sample like a lie kept see where
you only get four or five we got seven
that's significantly more product but I
don't think I have any full sized items
here I am extremely disappointed in this
I think I'm gonna hang in for one more
beauty test tube and if it's as bad as
this I will be canceling my subscription
so I hate to be such a bummer guys you
know I'm excited when I'm genuinely
excited I'm not usually this big of a in
my videos but I'm really not happy with
this at all so all right well I if
anything comes out as being awesome you
will see it in my favorites video for
the end of May at the new Beauty test
tube
alright I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
