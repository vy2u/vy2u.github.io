you know subscribe to 12 different
channels you're gonna subscribe to all
their twitters and all their instagrams

Instagram you don't do any of that stuff
it's so easy ah the prizes are so
amazing so let me show you first what
I'm giving away I picked art as the
brand that I wanted to buy from we all
kind of picked a main brand to buy from
and then we have everyone has like a
little thing on the side that may or may
not go with that but I got you guys this
tart jewelry box and this is how it
comes I'm gonna take it out of the box
so you can appreciate the gorgeousness
that is this gift set oh my gosh it's so
amazing I want to keep it like I'm sad
but I don't get to keep this like I've
been looking at it for a while and it's
like oh my gosh I'm gonna have to give
this away
we said about it okay it is called the
jewelry box and it is a limited edition
um palette and reusable necklace so you
get a necklace with it that is right
here and then you open it up you open it
up like this and then no there's your
mirror I'm not going to blind you okay
I'm gonna take this off I'm not going to
take the plastic or cuz i'd only thing
to happen to these things and that so
you get one two three four five six
seven eight you get 16 shadows there and
you get not 16 shadows oh no that's not
enough not 16 shadows but 32 tart
eyeshadows amazing and that's not all my
friends that is not what it comes with
oh no it's not alright sorry for the
interruption of this wonderful video
with incredible editing for this
craptastic moment of me being an idiot
so I forgot to tell you about an entire
drawer so here the shadows I was just
talking about their half shimmers and a
half mat by the way I forgot to mention
that then you get this drawer here of
eight brand new lip glosses that are new
to this palette and then you also get
Park Avenue princess mineral powder
bronzer which is opposed to bleep

there I can focus on it that's right
there and then this here is an all-new
soft pink Luminizer a my goodness I'm so
jealous of you person that wins this
there's the other drawer that comes out
of there but I'm going to tell you about

them and there they don't look like they
have names on them but it looks like
there's two blacks new one has Sparkle
own the other doesn't yep I think that
one has Sparkle this one I think has
Sparkle and I think this one is just

tart give away without a tart blush I'm
going to also throw in this chart blush

only available for Christmas in that
four pack but this has not been touched
i just opened up the four pack took the
blushes out and then i'm giving them
away so this one is in magic and it is
gorgeous oh my goodness i am like so
jealous of you who wins this and it is
not a sparkle blush but it is just a
pink blush just a typical pink and it's
the Amazonian clay blush the one that
tarts famous for so our giveaway is
called new loves for Valentine's Day
because some of you may know I just got
the tart I couture palette and I
absolutely love it so that is my new
love is the Attard I shadows which I
never used before and tart blushes I had
broken up with dark washes I broke up
with the dark blush because I do not
feel like it was his pigmented as people
said it was and I was very frustrated
with these things but then you know when
you give a tarp blush a little bit of
love it starts giving back to you and
that's when you see the two true beauty
of a tart blush so when you get this
give it a chance my winter my winter
friend get this give this a little bit
of a chance use it a few times and that
pigmentation will really start coming
