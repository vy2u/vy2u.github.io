you that are brand-new at sephora well a
few things that are brand new one thing
that is pretty knew that I wanted to go
over I'm actually gonna start with that
one first that is the Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer potion that's
anti-aging it's not super new probably
have been out for a few months but I did
want to share this with you because of
how amazing it is i am telling you like
I have been using this pretty
religiously for the past couple of
months and I'm telling you the fine
lines in my eye area have diminished
significantly and in the packaging it
said one hundred percent of people saw
diminishment diminishing diminishment
diminishing I don't know you know I'm
trying to say of their fine lines and I
was like well a hundred percent that
doesn't seem very realistic but really
and truly it did work in my last video
it was a drugstore haul of different
things that were new at the drugstore
and one of them was the new revlon
anti-aging primer stuff and not anti
aging but it's like a wrinkle filler
thing and I literally looked at my eyes
and I was like I don't have any more
wrinkles around my eyes to try to fill
and it is because of this I'm very
particular about the products that I use
when I'm testing them to make sure i'm
only you testing one product on each
area of my face or my hands or whatever
it is at a time to make sure i know what
is causing the reaction and this is the
only thing i've been using new on my
eyes and I would definitely highly
recommend this it worked very well for
me of course I'm not guaranteeing that
it will work for you but I just want to
tell you that I did have a lot of
success with it it is other than its
saying anti-aging visibly it is exactly
the same as the regular Urban Decay
primer potion it does make my makeup
stay on longer you know no creasing all
of those wonderful things that you get
with the original but also the
anti-aging benefits and I'm telling you
I really did see diminishment and
diminish I'm still not sure I'm saying
that right I saw less wrinkles I I saw
less wrinkles in my area and I'm going
to continue to use this the next thing I
wanted to show you is the honest also
anastasia dipbrow pomade I saw a couple
of reviews for this including what would
Lizzie do makeup by teen who did it I do
like this product it is
extremely soft extremely creamy and
you're just supposed to put it on your
eyebrows uh not on your eyes but on well
you can't put on your eyelids but you
posed to put it on your eyebrows and
it's supposed to fill your brows and now
one thing I want to warn you about about
this is if you like your eyebrows to
look natural it is very difficult to get
your browser look natural with this
product because it is so creamy but i
will say that like i'm wearing it right
now i don't think my eyebrows look fake
but you know i can definitely tell a
difference like I when I wore it to work
I went and looked into my work the
mirror at work and I was like oh my
goodness I got some bros my brows were
like whoa but like on a day to day I
don't day to day I don't seem to notice
you know when you put it on you can see
how thick it goes on it does sink right
onto my skin it attaches to the hairs
and and it's very easy to work with it
lasts all day also I wanted to tell you
about this I know I'm kind of going on
and on but this thing has somebody who
says I did try to use this as an
eyeliner it is a little bit like for me
for a brown eyeliner I don't know I mean
I it was more the shade than the quality
of it it went on very very easily
because like i said it's very creamy but
I just I wasn't a big fan of the shade
with my hair color I did like it however
on my lower lashline it stayed on really
really nicely on my lash line kind of
wore off of my waterline a bit but
stayed on my lashline really really nice
two more products for you because you
know sephora stuff adds up so quickly i
really can't afford to get too many
things at a time but i did get i did
have some credit left over from when I
ironically when I returned my Dior
palette it was an 84 la palette so
that's what I used to buy all of this
stuff is the credit the store credit I
have for that and ironically i'm showing
you another do our product that i will
probably be returning I i I'm telling
you this is what I do I try to put my
blinders on I try not to let the name
influence my review but I will tell you
when I first took this out of the jar I
went oh oh it's so beautiful I was so
excited it comes with this little tiny
little brush and it's just so cute and
then you you oh I dropped it hold on and
then you open this up and it's like
enabling color tattoos like
sophisticated big sister right here I
mean just so gorgeous just creamy
looking this is oh I forgot to tell you
what it is so before I actually show you
you know this watch is it all while I
tell you what it is this is the Dior
show fusion mono matte cream shadow and
this one is in the color Celeste now I
will show you the swatch of it okay so
let me show you how gorgeous this is I
put it on and it's so soft oh my gosh
look how soft it's just not look how
sauce but I wish you could feel this it
feels like silk I mean it just feels
amazing here's the swatch I know you
can't really see it but on the lid it
really appears nicely I think it's just
because of my skin tone but I mean it
just applies beautifully I'll just keeps
watching it so you can see it so as you
saw it does take a bit to build it up to
the full strength I tried applying this
with a primer without a primer with the
brush without the brush with other
shadows by itself I tried every
variation of this and I ended up not
liking it and I'll tell you why I don't
like it which really stinks because I
was really rooting for this product it
was so excited about it and it's because
it just doesn't last when it comes down
to it just doesn't last it lasts maybe
six hours or so which is probably one of
the worst track records of an eyeshadow
i have ever seen which disappointed this
is a thirty-dollar eyeshadow and it
should be amazing and i think that they
sacrifice the longevity for the softness
and for the mat and it's just very
powdery when it comes down to it I think
there's just too much powder in it and
they're just can't stick but even with a
primer I use it with the Urban Decay
primer I use it with my lorac primer and
neither of them could hold on to this
product and it just makes me want to
just cry no I'm not I'm just being
stupid about it but it really made me
disappointed because I was I was rooting
for this product I wanted to work but
another bust for me for Dior all right
last up I have the new tarte lipsurgence
power pigment and this is similar to the
regular tort lipsurgence but this one is
supposed to be more pigmented it's
supposed to be longer lasting and you
can see the tube here there you go the
regular tort lipsurgence so they've made
it thinner and taller and you know
there's a you know
elementary school teacher and as you're
learning about child development you
learn about when you make something
shorter and makes it look like it is
it's less and when you make it longer
and makes you look like it's more so if
it's you know that's the trick they play
on three year olds to see if they have
developed this sense of space and
they've tricked they're trying to trick
us I think because this one here this I
have it well let me tell you it's in
blushing bride but this is one gram or
point of four ounces and the regular
chart lipsurgence is three grams or
point 1 ounce so this is about three
times the size of this the packaging is
very pretty okay so this is the new
blushing bride show you what that looks
like see very creamy very pigmented and
then this is the chart this is the
regular lipsurgence in hope ok so just
comparing those two they seem very
similar in pigmentation this may be
slightly more pigmented but not a huge
huge huge difference in my eyes one
thing that is a difference is this one
does have a little bit more of a mint
eNOS that plumping mint eNOS thing to it
where this doesn't have that as much so
if you don't like that then this would
be a better option for you but just the
the difference in the amount of product
and the difference in price i would
definitely recommend these over these i
just don't think the size difference is
worth it you know I'm saying like I just
I don't know the packaging's cuter but I
mean other than that I I like this one
just as much and you know I would choose
this over that so that is it for my
little new at sephora review / hall I
hope that was helpful for you and
