recently and a trip to the drugstore
that there are a lot of new products on
the shelves so what I did was I do a
search on youtube to see what everybody
was reviewing and I did not pick those
things such as the Maybelline Baby skin
and a couple other things at that point
there we're not a lot of reviews on this
so I tried to get you guys new stuff
that maybe you haven't seen in other
videos before so I'm gonna go ahead and
get through this as quick as I can
because the battery's dying so let's go
ahead and rock this out we're gonna go
ahead and start with Maybelline first
now of course i did not get everything
new in the line i skipped the baby
skanks everybody's reviewing it and I
stuck with I did the blushes because I
hadn't really seen these yet they came
up with two new blush formulas this one
is called the master highlight and it's
by faith studio and this one is the
master glaze by face studio and this one
is supposed to be a highlighting bronzer
they did have a couple of blushes but
this one is the bronzer version for you
let me show you what it looks like so
zoom this so that is what that looks
like and then inside they give you a
brush and the brush is okay it's a
little bit scratchy I'm not super
functional but i will show you the
swatch and i just swirl them all
together because the colors are too
small to really get them individually
and here is hand swatch so you can see
what that looks did you see how orange
that is so because it is so orange I
would never never never use this as a
bronzer or a contour ever but it is
really nice for an orange eat owned
blush I actually was wearing this in a
few previous videos where I got a lot of
compliments on my makeup where I was
wearing a was I wearing I was wearing
like reddish colors like beige and red
colors and I had my eyes with some
bronzy colors and some some reds and you
know some burnt oranges and things and
this is what I had on my cheeks and it
looked really nice so there is a place
for this but it is not as a bronzer I'm
highly pigmented very easy to use about
a six to eight hour wear nice product
overall but again not a good bronzer for
me at least
blush I wanted to show you is this
master glaze and I have absolutely
fallen in love with this blush it is a
stick blush which I do enjoy stick
blushes but this is actually one of my
favorites go ahead and swatch this for
you so let me zoom me and again there we
go so this is what it looks like this is
how much it rolls up i have used it a
little bit that's how much it rolls up
here is a hand swatch yeah you and
that's what that looks like and that's
actually the blush that I'm wearing
today I don't know if you can see I try
not to overload it i'm going to put a
little bit more on so you can see that's
the way i apply it and then I just kind
of blend it out and I absolutely i'm
looking at the monitor excuse me i
absolutely love this blush again another
sixty eight hour wear blush but for a
stick blush cream blush i really think
that that's very nice sometimes I feel
like cream blushes are a little
difficult to apply a little difficult to
blend and sometimes don't have the best
staying power this one is very contrary
to that if I didn't have a gazillion
blushes I would be buy more of these
this is one that I would definitely
recommend to anybody all right so I got
I wanted to show you this one I didn't
actually intend to put this in the video
because I didn't have it when I plan to
do this video but I just got this in my
new Beauty test tube and this is the
Revlon age-defying wrinkle remedy line
filler and I got a lot of requests to
review this my friend chica loves makeup
reviewed this on her channel and I could
not agree with her more it does
absolutely nothing for okay so these are
the wrinkles that I tried to do
something with I did use the line filler
today and as you can see my wrinkles are
still very prominent even after
completing my makeup this one don't
waste your money it doesn't work at
least on these wrinkly guys here I don't
have as many fine lines around my eyes
because of a product that I'm actually
going to tell you in my high-end version
of this my new at sephora video that's
coming up next so we'll hold off on that
and don't buy this next up are these NYC
trios I got this one in long beach sands
in my influenster voxbox and I was like
it's really not that bad they're pretty
pigmented but I felt like these two
shades were very very similar and not
really worth putting in the same palette
and I was like you know what I'm going
to buy another one of these will try it
out and I'm sad to say that these are
not as good as the wet and wild I think
they're trying to be the wet and wild
but they're about 70
what the wet and wild are there not bad
shadows but they're not good shadows and
I would not recommend these the they do
come with the sponge applicator they
come with this plastic covering and then
you take the plastic covering off and I
throw the little brush away but I mean
they're else watching for alongside okay
so these are the three from long beach
sands and then these are the three from
late night latte so the pigmentation is
a little hit or miss the one a couple
the shade they are not very pigmented
but my biggest gripe with it is even
with a primer they just don't last all
day and that's something that I rely on
with my wet and wild shadows and I know
that they're going to last all day and
these just fall flat when I used a
primer they actually this the the colors
look like they were going to be more
pigmented but then they ended up just
fading just as quickly as without a
primer so big bus on these NYC trios I
had high hopes but no such luck ladies
so on the cover girl I got to cover gold
products this one is the bombshell
eyeshadow and then this one is the
bombshell liner will talk about the
eyeshadow first overall I really like
this shadow it has a really nice lasting
power my biggest gripe about it is how
slowly it dries she makes it a little
difficult to blend shadows with my
friend Kristen / kriston game had
reviewed this and she had mentioned in
her video that actually recommends
putting this over top of a shadow so I
decided to try doing that and it
actually worked pretty nicely if you
have a matte shadow and you just want to
add a little bit of a shine to it this
does work well because it is buildable
so you can get the teeniest tiniest
little bit on your finger let me show
you the little tiny bit I mean it's this
little tiny too okay so that's the way
that that looks and what I get on my
finger is literally that much and that
much will cover my entire eye and then
i'll show you how much product that
applies I mean it's just really
pigmented but you can shear out which is
nice and then it does build up so I'll
take a little bit more and then build it
up show you i am wearing it on my lids
today so I'll kind of show you what that
looks like one of my points I want to
make is that these do not blend with
other shadows very well so this was the
YC and this was kind of the best color
out of the NYC but it didn't because
this dry so slowly it just didn't blend
very well so for me there were some hits
and misses about this particular product
good things about it it's buildable it's
less all day no creasing just a
beautiful color negatives to it drawing
very slowly difficulty blending it with
other eyeshadows so if I didn't have a
ridiculous number of eyeshadows I may
purchase more of these but I don't need
it so I'm not going to buy it but this
is definitely i'll recommend next up is
the eyeliner you can see how teeny tiny
this thing is let me see the ounces
let's doesn't see how many ounces it is
so this is a point 2 ounce I pen
eyeliner and if you know me you know i
love my pen eyeliners it does have a
screw top which is a little bit
different and then you've got your pen
tip now this is a bit smaller like I
have this Maybelline master precise this
one is a point three seven ounces so
this one is smaller in both visually and
actually has less product sometimes you
just don't know so let me show you how
this one works I'll just put it next to
this gold shadow um that's a little
wonky I don't know if you can see but
it's not super opaque it does have a
little bit of sheer look to it this
eyeliner is okay alright it's not
fantastic it's okay there's a lot of
hoopla about the Jordana one that you
can get at walgreens and I like that one
until I used it a bit and now I don't
like it I don't like the firmness of
that marker tip so this is a good
alternative if you want a brown they
don't really make Browns in pan liners
for drugstore very often so this is a
good alternative for that if you like
the flexible felt tip but overall this
is just not my favorite I mean the
lasting power one it was okay one thing
I did have a problem with this is it
drying out if you don't put the top on
all the way it will dry out but then if
you give it a day and you shake it up
and you know work with it it does Remos
yer eyes but i don't know i just wasn't
a huge fan of this not a no x don't try
it but not a fantastic you've got to get
this one a kind of product i'd be
curious to see what the other
colors I have to offer but this one just
an okay the last two things i want to
show you our nail polishes up this is
not the right one where's my right one
hold up hold up Ron L'Oreal not that
right one so I have to nail polishes one
from l'oreal and one from maybelline
l'oreal came out with a new line and
this one is in rough around the edges
i'll put the actual name of the new line
here because i can't remember what it's
called but it's like something about
diamonds and it is a sand polish but it
is very very glittery and it's just
gorgeous it works very very well I don't
have a nail Squatch or anything to do
that with with you but i will show you
up close what it looks like alright so
that's what the polish looks like and
let me give you the drip test i would
like doing a little drip test you can
see how thick it is and see it's still
not dripping it's like thick come on
drip drip is it coming as a government
is coming there we go so this one is
definitely a one to two code polish
depending on how opaque you want it
really nice long lasting power very
difficult to remove because of all the
glitters in the sand and all of that but
i would actually compare this to the
julieg ones that i absolutely love I
have an entire collection how many you
have one two three four five six seven
eight I have eight of the Julie GCM
polishes and it reminds me of those and
i absolutely love that formula because
of the glitters that are mixed in with
the sands it's not completely flat like
let's say the soil ones are very flat
looking I like them they're just flat
and if I want like a more shimmery look
I will definitely reach for either this
one if I want the black of course and
then I a rainbow of Julie's new ones I
needed more nail polish I would
definitely get this one this is a
recommends good stuff and then the last
thing I wanted to show you is a new
maybelline color show and i have a bunch
of these show you so I have these three
Maybelline Color show dots they were the
Polka Dot collection and I bought both
all of these and really the only one
that I like is the black one because the
color inside isn't of the glitters it's
of the actual it's like a tint to the
liquid in there but it's not enough of a
tense that it will be at opaque polish
all it kind of does is tint whatever
color you put it over top of but the
glitters want glitters but the little
flecks in there are black and white no
matter which one you have so i would not
recommend these two i would recommend
this one and I would also recommend this
one these are this is street art and
they also have a blue one I think
there's a black and white one and it
might be another one but really really
love this formula why I like this one is
because it has the red specks in it it's
got black specks and it also has other
than circles it's got some shavings in
there so it makes a really cool
splattered paint effect that reminds me
of my formula X nail polishes that are
twelve dollars a piece for the full size
so definitely recommend this one a lot
this one had a really nice staying power
as a top coat this one is not one that I
would ever put us all my bare nails but
I put it over a white polish and it just
looked gorgeous so what definitely
recommend these and that is it from my
new at the drugstore I hope you got to
see some new products that you haven't
seen before maybe some things you have
seen but maybe some things that no one's
reviewed yet and hopefully you got
something out of it maybe something to
stay away from something that you want
