I
you
hello my friends welcome to am eyewear
test / review of a ton of new drugs to
our products I figured I would just
throw them all into a video all together
to give you as much information as
possible in a short of a period of time
as possible I have been trying these
products for about three weeks to a
month a little longer for the NYX liquid
suede I've had these for about two
months so I have more than just today's
impression for you for these products
let's go ahead and start with the lip
product because I'm dying I have to get
a lip balm on I'm Donna me first of all
let me give you a little background on
how I test these things I don't do
anything different when I do wear tests
I don't try not to touch my face I don't
eat little teeny tiny bites I don't
drink out of straws I I do regular
people things because when I test the
lip product I want to know what's it
gonna be like on the daily so my lip
product is messed up because I've used I
put it on 145 today and now it's 945 so
this lasted really really really well
through lunch for lunch today I had some
vegetables um you know I drank some
water you know like just like general
like I didn't really have like a huge
lunch where I was wiping my face a lot
and I would tell you that it really
lasted through my lunch very well it did
not make it through the burger at dinner
did not make it through like it's got
some weird like naft enough going on up
here like bull but until then it
actually did look really nice i went out
to dinner with some friends and they
even complimented me on my lip color and
i was like i'm wearing this is 145 go
like what and it had worn a little bit
kind of around the rim of my mouth but
that's about it so as far as these i
would recommend these in the lighter
colors for the longevity of them but i
will tell you that when you first put
these on they're very very sticky
they've got a sticky feel and it lasts
for a good couple of hours where your
lips go and they stick together it's
kind of gross and then they start drying
out so what I would suggest with these
is to carry a lip balm with you so put
this on throw the lip balm over top of
it it will take care of the stickiness
for the most part and also it will help
it to not feel so drawing because I was
doing a where test I couldn't do that
but
will mess with the longevity of it if
you do that so just be aware of that so
you're kind of giving and taking certain
things when you wear it with a bomb but
personally I like them better with a lip
balm over top all right let me get some
lip balm speaking of some lip balm
because I can't take it anymore it's
driving me crazy all right so much
better okay now that my lips feel
comfortable let's go in and talk about
the foundation got my moisturizer on but
I did not wear any kind of face primer
because I wanted to see what it would do
without face primer I feel like the
average drugstore makeup wearer that's
just going to the store to buy some
drugstore foundation probably isn't
going out of their way to buy primer of
course us make of junkies probably do
but you know I just wanted to test it
without primer this is the where with
the pro without primer and I feel like
it lasted really well really really well
it is kind of a lighter to medium
coverage the way that I put it on so I
mean you can definitely see my friend
was shining through but I feel like you
could see my friend was shining through
even at the beginning so I feel like at
war really really well and I've had
great experience with this so far I've
worn this probably at least ten times at
this point and every time I've really
enjoyed it I do feel like at the end of
a tough work day I feel like it fades
more than it did today today was kind of
a low stress kind of day so overall
really happy with this oh did I mention
what it is it is the dream of velvet
soft matte hydrating a foundation and I
don't think I told you the shade of the
lip product this is the NYX liquid suede
I'm skipping steps here in the shade
soft-spoken is what I chose for sure
eyeshadow I started off with the fergie
eyeshadow primer on this side and
nothing on this side and then I use this
is not know this is just a drugstore
eyeshadow primer that I chose to use
today and then i use the nut rep the
revlon colorstay not just nudes romantic
nudes I do have the other one as well
and I can tell you that this is the best
that this eyeshadow palette has ever
lasted all my eyes I don't know what I
did today different to make it last
longer I have no idea but I feel like
this isn't
not representative of what I typically
see this palette it's so weird so I
don't know if it's the dry weather or
what but I feel like it lasted really
well today especially the side with the
primer I feel like it's still kind of
deep but I also feel like it's kind of
accentuating my wrinkles a little bit
more like my fine lines a little more on
this side than it is on this side this
is the primary side this is the no
problem but overall I'm really happy
with the way this look today I don't
know what happened it's definitely a
nice drugstore palette I don't feel like
that this how it holds up to the the
pigmentation and the blend ability and
all of that of my high-end shadows if
you notice in the application I when I
put colors into the crease over top of
the lid color the lid color blended away
so you kind of have to go back and forth
you do have to work with this palette to
make it work but overall it's not a bad
palette it's really not and I do have
the other one the number one palette i'm
going to go ahead and insert some
swatches here for you that I took of
these pallets and they swatch very
nicely I have had some lasting power
issues with these where they have faded
through like a tough work day but
overall I mean they're pretty good for
drugstore pallets um but I definitely
don't think that they would be Dukes for
any kind of quality of some of my more
expensive eyeshadow next up for mascara
is actually one that I've really been
enjoying lately the Maybelline falsies
push-up drama mascara really been loving
this this does give that clumpy lash
look long thick clumps is what happens
to me when I use this mascara but it
actually is kind of nice I mean it's it
doesn't bother me that much of this
Clemson I don't know why I guess because
it adds so much volume in length that
the clumps aren't as big of a deal for
me it's not a deal breaker and I've
really actually been enjoying this and
I'm surprised as you can see there's no
flaking i have not wiped under my eyes
or anything there's been no flaking no
smudging i haven't done anything to mess
with my eyes at all I don't touch my
eyes during the day typically so I don't
touch my eyes during where tests and
yeah I feel like it still looks the same
as it did at 145 the smooth this
afternoon off this morning but this
afternoon and I'm very happy with this
mascara I've used this a ton of times
and I'm really really liking it a lot I
blush and contour today I had to pick
which contour palette I wanted to show
you because I did get quite a few
drugstore palettes
recently for contouring and I this time
I chose the Loreal infallible Pro
contour this is in the shade light I did
also purchase the one in medium this was
the 1i got first and you can see the
difference in color I got the medium one
I was like what it was L'Oreal thinking
it's so stinkin warm and everybody's
like um Jen you got the wrong one you
should have gotten the one in light it's
much cooler and almost like all man so I
went out and I got the one in light as
well this is more of a bronzer tone for
me then a contour this is more of a good
contour but as you may have seen in the
video and this is what I've been
experiencing hopefully it's represented
in the video the same that I'm
experiencing because you guys see things
everything really close up where I don't
see things with my eyes as close up as
you do but what I'm experiencing is that
this goes on as one kind of pigmentation
and they can't really build so here are
swatches I mean and that is like me
rubbing my hands these two are the light
and then these two are the medium it's
like there really isn't much there to it
there isn't much there to it but if
you're a new beginner to contouring I
think these are this one especially is
nice just to start off with because you
can't really make it too dark there
really isn't much you can do to mess it
up with this one the problem is is just
too warm I wish it was the same amount
of deepness but in a cooler tone and
then I think this one would been much
much better as far as blush today of
course I couldn't use this as my whole
contour because i was using the l'oreal
but i'll just give a quick review on
this one this is the Maybelline master
contour by face studio actually really
really like these products a lot I like
this not for a contour but for a bronzer
the blush and the highlight is stinking
gorgeous I don't think much of my blush
is left from today I don't know usually
it lasts pretty well I don't know why
today it didn't seem to last very well
but I'm gonna go ahead and swatch these
for you as well so you can compare them
to the L'Oreal I just watched I'm kind
of over here oh my gosh terrible okay so
really Jen okay so there is the contour
blush and highlight from the Maybelline
palette I actually really like the
highlight from the Maybelline palette a
lot let me do a second swatch there it's
just really not doing it justice it's a
gorgeous highlight it's really gorgeous
this is a nice bronzers not a nice
contour it's way too warm but overall I
really do like this palette a lot this
brush is stupid like I don't even know
what they were thinking like who in the
world is going to put their blush on
with this teeny tiny like am i a Cabbage
Patch doll what what is that like really
I mean I guess it can work but it's so
tiny I mean they could have made it a
little bit bigger come on give people a
chance here you know all right anyway
IRA freedom a blush a little bit oh it's
even contour with this see how it's like
bronzy looking suddenly not a good
contour this is like turning into a
whole nother mess of something minute
all right sometimes I improvised let's
put a little highlight action on I just
want to give you guys as much
information as possible so of course
this is over top after a long day but
just kind of give you an idea of what's
happening here what is that is that
something on my face what is that this
freckles all right but anyway that's
just a little crash course in this one
overall I do really like this one a lot
and if I had to recommend any of these
you're very light i would recommend this
one but anything else i would probably
recommend this one because the contours
not gonna work for you no matter what
and this is a better highlight than
these so that's my review of all this
new drug store stuff i have a bunch of
other stuff that i want to review for
