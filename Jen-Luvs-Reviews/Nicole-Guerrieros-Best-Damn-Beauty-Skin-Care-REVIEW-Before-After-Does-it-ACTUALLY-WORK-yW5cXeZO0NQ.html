long-awaited review of Nicole Guerrero's
best damned beauty skincare line I have
a lot that I want to share with you
about this and hopefully I'll be able to
give you enough information so that you
will be able to decide whether this
skincare regimen is a good for you or
not before I get going in the video just
a little bit about what's on my face
because I keep getting asked that a lot
and I want to make sure everybody knows
the website shop hush sent me a bunch of
stuff to try out and I'm actually quite
excited this is the first time I've used
this stuff so look for a review on the
channel soon on my eyes I'm wearing just
the Royals palette it's by a brand
called bad habit and this is what it
looks like on the inside mm-hmm and then
the Oasis highlighter is the other thing
that I'm wearing today this is the shade
that I'm wearing on my cheeks I believe
yes this one right here nude beach and
then I did use a little bit of tan lines
popped on my lips they are lip safe as
far as the pigments go but underneath
that I did where the ofra liquid
lipstick shade in Duchess I believe this
is the nikkietutorials one and then the
fancy beauty gloss balm and then the
highlighter just popped on top but that
is not what this videos about this video
is about skincare so basically there's
gonna be two major parts of this video
the first part we're gonna talk about
ingredients it's gonna be a very
ingredient heavy video because we are
talking about skincare and I find this
stuff fascinating and also I know a lot
of the people that watch my videos are
also very interested in ingredients some
people have sensitivities allergies some
people are vegan cruelty free things
like that so we're gonna talk about all
of that first and then we're going to
get into my experience with the products
and my full review time stamps are going
to be down below in case you would like
to skip ahead to the review section a
little bit about my skin I do have
normal skin I don't have breakouts I
don't have dry patches I don't have an
oily t-zone
I don't have any of that which is kind
of a blessing and a curse it has a
makeup and skincare reviewer because I
can't speak to those specific needs but
I do have some anti-aging concerns and
that I have some relatively deeper set
wrinkles on my forehead or at least I
we're gonna get into that and then I've
got some fine lines around my eyes some
fine lines starting to form here and
then some fine lines under my eyes even
though we are not going to be talking
about those because I was using a
different eye cream also just so you
know I am 39 years old I do have some
genetic benefits in that both of my
parents look pretty young so that is not
due to the skincare but I will show you
some before and after pictures in a
little while to show you the before I
started using it and the after so you
can see if you see any differences so
let's go ahead and get started with best
damn beauty as a line it looks like
Nicole started at this line back in 2014
and then slowly released two products at
a time until the end of 2016 where she
released her ninth product I watched a
video by Nicole and she did say that her
line is cruelty free but I couldn't find
that information anywhere on the website
she thought was really weird because
usually when a company's cruelty free
they kind of plaster it everywhere so
thought that was odd so I sent in an
email to the company just to make sure I
haven't heard back quite yet I also
asked about their suppliers and whether
they were cruelty free or not so I will
put that information down below and I'll
also annotate it if I know anything
before the video goes live these
products are very very very much not
vegan I have found animal based products
in a lot of these products including
carmine beeswax and lanolin but we're
gonna talk about which ones in which in
just a minute I have been using these
products for about three and a half
months so I feel like I have a good
solid opinion about these products
ideally I would like to try skincare
products for longer but I really do
think I have a good opinion on these
based on that trial period not perfect
but I've got a good opinion as of the
day I'm filming this video if you sign
up for their emails you will get 40% off
I got all of my products on HauteLook
for very inexpensive so don't worry
about buying these at full price unless
you're in an emergency situation you
will probably be able to find them for
less expensive I will leave my whole
look referral link down below it's just
a customer referral link and then
definitely sign up for best damn
beauty's emails and they will let you
know when they have sales on their
actual site so let me tell you what I
got and the order that I put them on so
the first thing that I do is I cleanse
my face I've used various cleansers
during this three and a half month
period
I do use the Peter Thomas Roth toner I
have been using that one for quite a
while
and actually dipped a little bit into my
ordinary review so I was using that the
end of when I was using the ordinary
products which was my last skin care
review a few months ago and then after
my toner I very quickly put on the best
damn Beauty best damn firming serum
firms tightens and smooths skin is this
job here after that enough I kind of let
that seep in for a few minutes before I
apply one or the other of these we have
the best damn Beauty oil and also the
best damn moisturizer I'm gonna be
saying damn a lot in this video so if
that bothers you I'm really sorry it's
the name of the product I can't help it
I started off using the moisturizer at
night and the beauty oil during the day
but then I realized the beauty oil
wasn't really meshing with a lot of my
foundations it was making my foundations
break up so I switched them and started
using the moisturizer during the day but
as you'll see an ingredient analysis you
definitely want to use this with a
sunscreen I really feel like these are
interchangeable and a routine unless you
use a foundation then you probably want
to stick with the moisturizer because it
does seep into the skin better than the
beauty oil I've also been using the best
damn beauty lip mask which was the only
product I had heard of before I started
preparing for this video before I bought
the products I heard wonderful things
about this you can see it's been through
a lot the label is definitely cracking
and is a hot mess so that has been my
skincare routine for the past three and
a half month now let's get into the
nitty-gritty of each product one by one
we're gonna start with a firming serum
this is $36 for one ounce of product I
did pay $18 for this on a whole look I
did compare it with some Sephora brand
products these are some of the most
popular similar-looking products I
didn't go so deep into ingredients
because that would have taken me forever
to find ingredients similar products and
I just didn't have another three hours
to find that but I just wanted to
compare to some of the more popular
products at Sephora so the Estee Lauder
perfectionist CP + our wrinkle lifting
serum is $68 for the same size the
Korres black pine 3d sculpting firming
and lifting face serum is $75 for almost
the same size and the philosophy when
hope is not enough is $45 for the same
size so this is less expensive than
those it did come with a cap on it and I
prompt
lost it just so you know the moisturizer
is also $36 you get 1.7 ounces in here
which is 21 dollars and 18 cents per
ounce some popular things that looked
kind of similar at sephora are the
Kiehl's ultra facial cream is 2754 the
exact same size so that is cheaper the
fresh Lotus youth preserved face cream
with super 7 complex is $45 for a little
bit less product and the belief a true
cream aqua balm is $38 for about the
same size so compare this in price to
like the belief aqua balm that's very
very popular I did get this together
with the lip mask and I paid $29 for the
combination of both so let's go into the
lip mask this is $26 on its own it's the
same price as the bite Beauty agave lip
mask and that is one that a lot of
people have been preparing this too and
we'll talk more about them we get two
ingredients this is $26 you do get point
5 ounces which is $52 per ounce some
similar products at Sephora are the
lineage lips sleeping mask is $20 for
0.7 ounces but it is less expensive and
the Clinique pep start pout restoring
night math that's 1754 0.34 ounces it
actually turns out to be about the exact
same amount per ounce as this as the
cleaning and then finally the beauty oil
I paid $19 for this the retail price for
this is $42 for 1 ounce comparing this
to the RMS beauty beauty oil is $78 for
the same size the BIOS on squalene plus
vitamin C rose oil is $72 for the same
size and the core organics Nonnie glow
face oil is $68 for about the same size
so if you were gonna compare these two
products at Sephora kind of think about
it and makeup wise do you like to face
tart they're not the luxury products but
they're the ones that are expensive
compared to drugstore but they're not
like the super expensive we're not
talking like tatcha drunk elephant here
we're talking about like those you know
expensive but not luxury brand pricing
alright now we're gonna get into the
nitty-gritty of the ingredients so let's
go ahead and go in the same order we're
gonna start with the firming serum so
water is the number one ingredient in
this number five is glycerin and we've
talked about glycerin a lot on the
channel there's some research to say
that if you live in a dry environment
that glycerin being a human
it will pull we'll try to pull moisture
out of the air but when it can't find
the moisture in the air it will pull
from the lower layers of your skin there
are other websites that say that has
been debunked and it's not true so it's
up to you what you want to believe I
haven't found conclusive evidence from
any site that I 100% trust about
glycerin so if you have that 100%
evidence let me know because I'm still
kind of on the fence about it the job of
bliss rain is to attract water to the
skin and help skin feel smoother and
softer it's also supposed to help skin
cells mature properly the next
ingredient want to talk about is jojoba
seed oil and that comes back a lot in
these products so jojoba seed oil is
good for dry skin and has soothing
benefits it's actually a liquid wax
rather than an oil number ten is
hydrogenated coco clyde glycerides --is
coconut wheel-drive if you are allergic
to coconut oil or if you don't like
coconut stuff in your product for
whatever reason you want to stay away
from pretty much this entire line
because a lot of it does have coconut
derived products in it the next one is
number 12 which is shea butter I know
some people don't like shea butter in
their products but I know a lot of
people do so it is supposed to help
retain moisture and lessen dry patches
some people swear by it some people
don't like it the next one is an
ingredient that shows up a couple of
times it's called obsidian
seed oil it's listed as something else
on the package but when you break it
down that's what it is it's similar to
two jojoba seed oil it's for skin
regeneration and it's an
anti-inflammatory and it's also skin
conditioning next at number 14 we have
ethics all palmitate some people don't
like to buy things with palm oil
derivatives for environmental read
reasons too just so you know it is in
there then we have number 15 as
niacinamide niacinamide is one of those
tried-and-true tested ingredients that
people rave about and look for in
skincare what I've seen it most in is
products that even out the skin tone
that help to reduce dark spots and
discoloration things like that it's all
supposed to help the appearance of large
pores which is super cool if that's
something that you're looking for it's
also supposed to reduce fine lines and
strengthen your skin's surface so that's
a really good woman I always happen to
see that in there we're starting to get
a little further down in the ingredient
list though so you know
tetra hexade echo ascorbate is another
penetration enhancer it's supposed to
increase your collagen levels it's
supposed to reduce melanin production
brighten skin and repair the effects of
UV exposure and other environmental
damage it's the same thing with the
niacinamide it's supposed to help even
out the skin tone vitamin E is another
ingredient that shows up a lot in these
products in here is the tocopherol
acetate that some people are sensitive
to it so I'm just throwing that out
there and number 18 is yogurt powder
which that's always really interesting
but I know some people you know some
people are vegans another reason not to
get this if so if you don't like dairy
products in your skincare ingredient for
whatever reason you don't want to get
this and I only went up to 20
ingredients because beyond that I'm
thinking you know there's probably an
insignificant amount I don't have
evidence of that but I really want to
focus on the top 20 ingredients so this
one is called snow mushroom extract
which shows up a couple of times it's a
natural alternative to sodium hi Lauren
eight it's a jelly-like fungus
okay and it's traditionally found in
Asian skincare supposedly it draws
moisture into the skin and penetrates
easier than hyaluronic acids I thought
that was kind of interesting other
ingredients of note alcohol
phenoxyethanol and fragrance so if you
don't like those ingredients you're
gonna want to stay with it but stay away
from this one moving on to the moisture
again water is the number one ingredient
number two is glycerin which we just
talked about a minute ago then we have
cetyl alcohol which is a texture
ingredient but it also helps of
ingredients that penetrate into the skin
then we have Caprican capric
triglyceride also helps ingredients to
absorb into the skin next we have
safflower seed oil which is a fatty acid
that helps with dry skin specifically
number seven is dimethicone
I know some people don't like to see
dimethicone in their skincare if that's
you then you don't want to get this but
if you have never had any problems with
dimethicone then you won't you shouldn't
have a problem with this fxo palmitate
is number eight which we just talked
about numbers 9 and 10 are said Tirol
Olive 8 and sorbitan olive age so these
are made from olives and their
moisturizers that give the lux texture
to the cream it gives it that nice
smooth luxury kind of feel number 11 is
shea butter which we already talked
about and number 12 is avocado oil and
I've heard a lot about good
things about avocado oil in skincare the
websites that I read said that its skin
replenishing antioxidant it can help
with eczema and may help prevent acne in
that it unclogs pores and it's also an
anti-aging ingredient I've read that in
multiple sources thirteen is that
obsidian seed oil again and then we have
number 14 which is squalene and that is
an ingredient another one that a lot of
people look for some people believe that
it's only from shark liver but that's
not true actually they get a lot of
squalene and squalene from olives so
just so you know it is moisturizing and
also really good for eczema this is
supposed to be like a miracle ingredient
for people with dry skin if you have dry
skin in them you've probably used you've
used products with squalene or squalene
definitely leave that in the comments
below they're basically the same thing
squalene and squalene
there's just slight differences I don't
want to get into too much but there's
very slight differences but they're
supposed to basically do the same thing
number fifteen is organic aloe leaf
juice it's an anti-inflammatory now this
is one that's really really important
this next one number eighteen is retinol
palmitate and then number twenty-five is
retinol so this is definitely something
you want to use with a sunscreen because
retinol palmitate and retinol both can
increase sun sensitivity so just be
really careful if you're going to be
using this during the day make sure you
apply your sunscreen first number
nineteen is another really highly
respected ingredient it's called Alan
Cohen
it's skin soothing it's healing it's
supposed to help shed the outer layer of
your skin it's supposed to promote
formation of healthy tissue and also
help your skin to absorb moisture and
then finally we have that mushroom
extract at number 20 moving on to the
lip mask now the lip mask is very
similar to the bite Beauty agave lip
mask so if you don't like that lip mask
you are not going to like this one it's
very very similar the number one
ingredient is lanolin and lanolin
basically what they do is they shear the
sheep make sure the wool off the Sheep
and then there's this gooey stuff that's
kind of where their skin was before they
sheared it off it's like this dewy
you know sebum oily stuff and they take
that off and that's your lanolin a lot
of nursing women use products with a
lanolin to help their their nipples
there's no other way to say it and
it's a body part so we're gonna call
them nipples because that's what they
are and when your nipples get cracked
from nursing because it does happen if
you're nursing for most women it's very
soothing and healing it's also it's
supposedly not harmful for the baby but
if you think about where it comes from
it's kind of gross for some people so if
that person's you out and putting that
on your lips then you definitely don't
want to get this product cuz that's the
number one ingredient also if you are
allergic to sheep's wool you want to
stay far away from this number three is
beeswax again not vegan it is a texture
ingredient they do say that it can
soften skin but I couldn't find a lot of
evidence to back that up
something called inulin which is it from
chicory root that is a humectant and
then going on to some certified organic
products we have the jojoba seed oil
olive fruit oil and the shea butter
those are all certified organic
ingredients and I believe we've talked
about all of those they all have claims
of various skin benefits mostly in
hydration and then tocopherol that's
their the vitamin E that's in this of
your sensitive vitamin E again stay away
number ten is fragrance and then we have
some colorants including carmine carmine
is made from bugs that they boil and
then squeeze the juice out of it's a red
pigment yes you're putting this on your
lips it's in a lot of eyeshadow and lip
products just so you know and blush
products any a lot of products that are
red that are not vegan will have carmine
in them just so you know but it's gross
I know and then finally we have the
beauty oil a number one ingredient in
this is the safflower oil it's a fatty
acid that can help with dry skin then
number three is that capper licking
capric triglyceride it helps with the
absorption then we have the olive fruit
oil and then the squalene the squalene
is very high up in this one which I
thought was super cool
jojoba seed oil is number six and then
number eight is that obsidian seed oil
and then number nine is rose hip extract
that's an antioxidant and number 11 is
marula oil which is another one that is
getting a lot of positive marula oil is
supposed to deeply penetrate into the
skin and it is an antioxidant lots of
lots of positive hype around that one
then we have our tocopherol which is the
vitamin E that's
here and the last ingredient in here is
something called a little ool and there
is some mixed information about this ewg
says that it's skin sensitizing possibly
cancer-causing but every other website
that I find to be legitimate says that
that's crazy it's not it's actually just
a fragrance and that the only way that
it's cancer-causing all of that is if
it's in a super high concentration the
fact that it is the last ingredient in
this gives me absolutely no concern
based on the research that I've done ok
so now we're done with ingredients let's
go into my full review of all these
products we're gonna go in the same
order I think it's really important for
you to know that I did use these as a
regimen so I can't speak to them and the
effects of them individually all I can
speak to them is all of them together as
a whole so first let's start with the
firming serum it is let me show you the
texture of it it is like a creamy yellow
color it is quite quite liquidy it has a
very light floral scent it absorbs into
the skin very quickly it does have a
little bit of an oily feeling to it but
again that absorbs very quickly into the
skin within a few minutes you can't feel
it at all from the research that I've
done with serums you definitely want to
let this seat fully into your skin
before you apply any other products to
make sure that you get all of those good
skin benefits without it mixing with
other products and now that I've mixed
it into my hands I can now barely feel
it and you can see how long that's been
it really does seep in very very quickly
the moisturizer exact same thing where
it does seep into the skin very nicely
very easily it has a little bit creamier
of a scent but the scent is very similar
to the serum just very lightly floral
it's not offensive in any way but it
definitely has a scent again like I said
in the ingredients very important if
you're going to use this make sure you
use a sunscreen first because it does
have retinol and retinyl palmitate in it
the beauty oil this is a bit heavier as
you would expect a beauty oil to be it
definitely has the lightest scent of
anything that I tried in the line but it
definitely still does have a scent this
is one that you're going to feel for a
while on your skin it is going to feel
really it's a
it's a it's an oil and it's oil-based
and there's lots of oil in it and it's
gonna feel oily so expect that and like
I mentioned before you want to make sure
you might want to be careful mixing that
with foundation like putting that on
then putting foundation on top of it
just because it might break it up that
was my personal experience anyway
alright and then the last thing is the
lip whew the last thing is the lip Maps
now the lip mask is very rose-scented
that is my least favorite scent to put
on my lips I don't enjoy the smell of
rose it is a little bit hard to get out
of the pot I kind of have to dip back in
two or three times to get enough product
but at the same time my finger isn't
sinking in so much that I'm putting way
too much product on you know any mean
but it is kind of hard it is a little
bit sticky and put it right by my
microphone so you can hear the tackiness
we're doing ASMR here so so yeah so it's
got a little bit of tackiness to it it
is quite thick but it isn't sticky on
the lips it just feels very heavy and
thick this is a really nice product to
use if you're prepping your lips for lip
product this is something that I like to
do it if I remember is when I first sit
down to do my makeup I put on the bite
Beauty got a lit mask or this leave it
on my lips while I do my face and then
before I put on my lip product wipe it
off just to give my lips a little bit of
hydration while I'm waiting to apply
makeup so that's worked very well for
this but honestly this is probably my
least favorite product in the line I
don't find it to be especially effective
in long-term healing of dryness I don't
know why I feel like UV I don't know
what it is in the bite that I feel like
is just a little bit better than this I
have recently been kind of abandoning
that though as well I don't feel like I
feel like it does good in the initial
and then I feel like after a while it
doesn't it doesn't have any long-term
effects now contrary to that I did see a
significant difference in my skin using
the rest of the products
one way that I gauge how my skincare is
working is actually the reaction of my
subscribers so for a while I was using
Paula's Choice skincare I love my polish
choice I love the stuff that I've been
using from them
and people autumn you know within the
few months of me using a couple months
of me using it people were saying oh my
gosh your skin looks amazing
then I started using products by the
ordinary and the compliments completely
stopped it was very odd and then as soon
as I started using this one maybe not as
soon as but within a month or two of
using the best damn beauty products the
complements started coming back now this
is not counting the videos that I did
use a filter on I do occasionally or I
have in the past occasionally use a
filter over my videos to smooth my skin
out for like what's up and makeup or
things where I'm just giving commentary
where I'm not reviewing anything on my
face but this is not counting those this
is the ones that were unfiltered just
like this video is and just like every
video I'm going to make from here on out
at least that's my plan I will make sure
I let you know if ever there's a filter
on my video again but as of now I'm not
going to be using them anymore but you
know I that was when I was getting the
compliments and that's when I took it
seriously I have also been noticing a
big difference in my wrinkles on my
forehead especially they have definitely
gone down some I definitely solve
wrinkles there but they're less and less
and less and I am so impressed with that
I also noticed I was starting to get
some fine lines here those have also
gotten to be less I have some fine lines
on the sides of my eyes those have
gotten to be less I have been using a
separate eye cream by Juice Beauty so
I'm not counting my eye area
I haven't noticed much difference on my
neck I do extend my beauty products to
my neck I haven't noticed any
significant improvements there but
overall as a whole I have seen a
difference I'm gonna go ahead and show
you a before and after picture one of
these is my after picture from using the
ordinary and then the other one I took a
few days ago before I left for San
Francisco for my collaboration with
Stephanie Nicole I didn't bring my
skincare with me on the trip so I didn't
want to take it after I took it before
so these are the pictures so you can see
the difference in my skin I know that I
can see a significant difference I would
love to know whether you think you can
see a significant the significant
difference Nicole actually recommends
using the Beauty oil after the
moisturizer I find that to be extremely
extremely heavy I don't like to use it
that way I think
it's too much I like to use one or the
other but you can use both if that's
your personal preference personally I
don't think you need eat both of these
products I would pick whichever one you
feel like you're going to enjoy more the
ingredients are relatively similar so go
back to the ingredients and see which
one you think is better for you or which
texture you think is better for you but
I definitely personally don't think that
you need both so final thoughts who is
this good for and who is it not good for
it's definitely not for people who are
vegan if you're vegan stay far away
another person this is not going to be
good for are people that don't like
fragrance in their skincare because all
of these products are fragrance the one
with the least amount of fragrance for
me is the beauty oil so if you are
sensitive that may be one you'll be able
to tolerate but I would definitely skip
out on the rest of them I mean really if
you look at these three products here
the ingredients are quite similar in the
three so if you only were going to get
one I would say just pick whichever one
of these calls to you the most if you
were going to get two I would say get
the serum and then get one or the other
of these at this point I'm not really
recommending this I feel like it's quite
overpriced and I know that the lam Ilyn
really freaks some people out also
carmine really freaks people out so that
might be something in here that would
knock this out for you but if you are in
love with the bite Beauty agave lip mask
and you're just kind of tired of it or
if you've always wanted to try it and
you see this for sale then you may want
to pick it up I definitely recommend
keeping an eye on this stuff being on
sale it has been out now the entire line
for quite a while so it is starting to
show up in discount situations I don't
think she's released a product since
2016 I feel like that they've really
tried to incorporate skincare benefits
for lots of different people
we've got anti-aging ingredients we've
got anti dryness ingredients we've got
anti acne ingredients which i think is
great because when you're formulating
something you can formulate it for one
person you can deform elate it for a lot
of different people and I feel like
they've really taken a lot of different
skin types into account when when
putting this formula together and like I
said I saw result so I have no
affiliation with Nicole Guerrero I've
been in the room with her once but did
not speak to her not for any other
reason other than that she was a huge
youtuber and I had like 2,000
subscribers so I didn't go up and talk
to her
it was way early in my youtube career
that I was in the same room with her but
I'm not affiliated with her I did
purchase these products if you've ever
tried best damn Beauty I have got to
