video i was tagged by erica from brains
to beauty who i absolutely adore i love
her to death she makes fantastic videos
if you don't know her channel i'll put a
link down below and maybe i'll put a
link i don't know i'll put a link over
there to Erica's channel in case you
want to go check it out i'll also put a
link down below in case you missed that
little opportunity right there okay so
um this tag is called the no makeup tag
and there are a bunch of questions that
I'm going to answer that ergo gave me so
here we go all right scouts honor you're
not wearing makeup I don't remember any
of the girl scout stuff but scouts honor
I'm not wearing any makeup what is one
makeup product that I cannot live
without and that would be my Revlon
age-defying concealer around my eyes it
just seems to brighten my entire face um
I don't know what it is about it but it
just seems to make me look like I am
awake and alert and ready to go for the
day so if I have to choose one thing
that I cannot live without it would be
this if I had got a chance to pick two
things I couldn't live without second
thing would be my Urban Decay 24-7 liner
in zero um I feel like eyeliner really
makes a huge difference in the way that
I look the way my eyes are like the
shape of my eyes I feel like it really
makes my eyes stand out when I wear
especially black eyeliner so I love this
and I don't want to live without this
either so we'll say both these what's
one thing I feel confident living
without and one thing that I definitely
feel confident living without is
highlighter I kind of feel like I don't
know if you feel this way but I kind of
feel like highlighter is a bit for me
rather than for other people it makes me
feel like a movie star but just for fun
because I do like to do reviews I wanted
to show you my three favorite
highlighters this is my benefit high
beam especially in the winter time when
I
more pale if you have lighter skin this
one's a really nice one I don't know how
it would look on darker skin but this
one is really nice on my pelo lighter
skin I haven't ever tried it in the
summertime I'm curious to see whether
will work as well my skin gets a little
bit darker the other two this one here
is my bare minerals and pure radiance
and I really really like this one
because it is closer to my natural skin
tone and it really gives a nice shine I
feel like it's less noticeable then this
one and this one actually looking at the
swatch it's very similar and I'm
surprised this is my favorite summertime
highlighter on on Tanner skin this just
looks absolutely gorgeous and this is
the Laura Mercier illuminator and it's
I've had this for two years and I use it
almost every day in the summer time and
you can see I've barely made a dent in
it and it is just the most beautiful
color on medium skin tone just
absolutely gorgeous but completely and
totally unnecessary do I feel confident
with no makeup on I do i do feel
confident with no makeup on there were
times in my life when I didn't feel
confident with no makeup on but I think
I've come to a place where I'm a mom
I've been through pregnancy you know
where I got quite Haggard at times know
you moms out there you may be able to
relate to this but I feel like you lose
all your pride through the process of
pregnancy I mean the horrible things
that happened your body and all the
doctors that look at you and all this I
mean it you just can't lose it all
between everything that happens through
having a baby and all I mean it just you
know make up come on make it having no
makeup on is like nothing compared to
going through the whole process of
pregnancy that's just my opinion which
part of your face do you like the most
is the next question and this is
honestly really hard for me to answer
like it's something that I honestly
don't think about like ever I've been
getting a lot of compliments on youtube
on my skin lately and I haven't ever
really thought about that um what I was
younger and I had a acne you know break
outs here in there like I used to hate
skin and now that I don't have breakouts
anymore like I think I just take it for
granted where's one place you can never
go without makeup on and to me that's
work I feel like it's part of my
professionalism to wear some makeup for
me personally I think people expect me
to be all done up at work I feel like my
students I'm a teacher expect me to be
all done up at work it's kind of my mo
oh it's kind of my little my little
thang thing I got going on there it's
kind of you know if I don't have makeup
on or if I'm not done up then people
think there's something wrong and I get
asked all day like are you sick like it
what what's wrong you know you look so
pale today and it's like oh do I really
look that bad so I try really hard to
wear makeup everyday to work because
people just basically bash me all day
long for looking awful and I don't I
don't mean it in a bad way they're just
concerned because I look like hell you
know so work I've always wear makeup to
work always i don't care if i'm dying
i'm still wearing makeup to work what's
one place you can go without makeup on
and I feel like just daily shopping like
grocery store running running errands
and stuff I can definitely wear no
makeup and be completely fine with them
so I'll go out like just feel fleet hot
mess and go out shopping and I just
don't care at all maybe it's is the area
I live in you know most people look like
a hot mess to be completely honest so I
just blend right in all right would you
rather go an entire week without makeup
or have your boyfriend do your makeup
now I have a husband not a boyfriend so
I'm assuming this is husband too and I
asked my husband this question he's like
that's an easy one you'd rather have me
do your makeup and that is a gazillion
he's a hundred percent right I would
absolutely rather have my husband do my
makeup because my husband is actually an
artist my husband is a tattoo artist we
own a tattoo shop and um he would
definitely rock my makeup I think I
don't know if he'd do it as well as I do
it just because he's not used to doing
it but um I think he'd do a pretty good
job so I would definitely have him do my
makeup / not wearing makeup for a week I
should do that tag to baby you want to
do that tag where the husband does the
makeup can you handle this I think I
could handle it if you do my makeup
I think I can handle your makeup you get
to decide what I do no I don't get to
say what you do you get to do whatever
you want and it's open to interpretation
it is open to interpretation it's just
makeup you do my make as my husband does
my makeup tag oh gosh so look forward to
that in the future alright so that's the
tag that's it that's the whole thing
nice and short and sweet I like this tag
I like the short ones good stuff I do
have other tags coming up that I've been
tagged in so look out for those in the
future Thank You Erica for tagging me
you rock girl right mad love and I'll
see you in the next video
I now that got them I don't want to give
them away and I told them I was like you
know you're gonna send me so many of
them i might as well do a giveaway with
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
