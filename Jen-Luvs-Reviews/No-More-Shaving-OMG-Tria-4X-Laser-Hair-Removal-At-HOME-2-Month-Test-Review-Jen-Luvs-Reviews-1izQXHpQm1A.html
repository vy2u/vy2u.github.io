review so excited to tell you about this
thing no I'm not not gonna say that
Boop that word gives away everything all
right I got final thoughts for you on
the tria
I got to show you pictures of whether
this thing actually worked if you're
interested in permanent hair removal at
home this is the video for you
hello my friends welcome to my final
thoughts on the tria this thing is mad
expensive so it's really important to
know before you invest your money
whether it works or not this was sent to
me for review it is a sponsored video
but I told TRAI I'm like shaking this
thing around I told them I said I'm
going to be honest is that okay with you
and they said yes so that says a lot to
Trina about their honesty and integrity
that they're okay with me being honest
and they're still willing to sponsor
this video no matter what I think about
it so let's go into the details about
the tree up tria is a laser hair removal
system I will link some information down
below giving you more specific details
about how tria Works pricing where you
can buy it all of those kinds of things
and I've been using this for two months
two months was when I did an initial
video showing the tria and talking more
about it I will link that down below I
even used it on my husband's face it was
fun making my husband go it was awesome
I'll link that down below one thing
really really important to know about
the tria is if you are of a medium to
deep skin tone you cannot use the tria
because it will burn your skin and I can
tell you I accidentally laid it on my
tattoo where I have a little bit of
black on my tattoo and I burned myself
so if you are a medium skin tone or a
deeper skin tone you can look on their
website and they'll show you the skin
tones how deep you can go before it will
start burning you it goes up to 5 levels
and I can tell you the higher you put
the level the more painful it is it
feels like they describe it as like a
rubber band flicking you and that's the
way my husband described it I feel like
it feels like electricity almost like
kind of zapping you a little bit
and it's just the laser and it's going
into your hair follicle and actually
killing the whatever it is that makes
your hair grow is what happened so what
you do is you turn this on okay and then
you put it on this red light on the
bottom you put on your skin and if it
does that that means your skin tone is
approved for treatment so I started off
on level two on my legs I just did my
right leg I did not do my left leg
because I wanted to be able to see the
difference so I started on level two on
the last treatment I was on level three
but it was kind of painful so I'm going
to go ahead and show you some progress
pictures now so you can see the the
progress of my leg hair not being there
anymore so here is the starter picture
and then this is the treatments in
succession so you can see how the hair
is as you can see I don't have thick
hair I don't have to care on my head I
don't have thick hair on my legs I don't
have thick eyelash hair I just don't
have thick hair so you have to kind of
take that into consideration when
looking at the pictures just naturally I
don't have a lot of hair so as you can
see after the last treatment you could
really really see the decrease in the
hair growth I will tell you this took a
while for me to see full results on my
legs but what I cannot show you what
because I won't is that it worked a lot
faster from worked about two weeks
faster on my bikini line than it did on
my leg so maybe thicker coarser hair
would do better with the tria I tried to
get information from them about whether
that was like a thing that your that the
thicker the hair the faster it would
work but they didn't seem to have the
answer to that question but it
definitely worked faster on my bikini
line than it did on my leg so I am going
to continue to use it a little bit
longer because I do still have some
patches of hair but I'm going to start
using it for treatment under my
underarms and also my other leg now to
get rid of all of that as well and then
I won't have to shave anymore which is
going to be pretty awesome
now on to some of the cons of the
product it does feel like something it
does feel semi painful depending on the
level that you have the higher level you
can bump it up to the faster your
results because I was on that low
and because I'm kind of a pain wimp I
definitely could not get the results of
someone would have been able to get if
they were on level 4 or 5 so keep that
in mind if you have a higher pain
tolerance you may be able to bump up it
bump up the level and get a faster
result than I did the battery life isn't
fantastic the battery life will last you
one to two uses before you need to
charge it and if it dies in the middle
of it it dies in the middle of it and
you can't use it while it's plugged in
so you kind of have to keep that in
consideration one other positive that I
really really like is that on the top
there is a number counter it counts down
how many treatments you've done I'll
just kind of treat my hand real quick
just you can see what it's like so you
just do that and then this laser comes
out of this little circle thing and it
treats the area now I can't feel it all
my hand because I don't have hair on my
hand right there so it's got this
counter up there so it tells you how
many treatments you've done in an area
and then they have a book that tells you
about how many treatment number of times
to do it for each area it does take a
significant amount of time what I do is
I put on Netflix and I just sit and I
just do it for my lower leg it takes me
about half an hour to do my entire lower
leg on one side so it is kind of
time-consuming also you can't see where
you've treated so you have to really
kind of focus on going in a pattern so
you want to go on in a line and then go
down a little bit and go across cross
cross cross that's what I do is I go
across the top and then I go across the
sides one side and then across the other
side and then I'm done and like I said
it takes about half an hour just for the
bottom of my leg on one side and think
about you know how much skin you have on
your body versus mine if you're a bigger
person than I am it may take longer
because you have more skin area than I
do
they do recommend overlapping the
circles so that takes a while to get all
of that done but if you're just sitting
watching TV or whatever it goes by time
goes by of course is going to take less
time to treat your bikini area your
underarms or whatever but overall I
really really like this thing I am happy
with the results I'm happy that I don't
I'm not going to have to shave the
summer they do say that it's not a
permanent hair removal
system the hair can grow back over time
but so far I'm loving it and I'm going
to keep it around and if I see my hair
growing back I'm just going to kind of
spot get the places where my hair is
growing back until hopefully it just
doesn't grow back at all which would be
amazing because you save money on razors
and save money on shaving cream and save
time and razor bumps and cutting
yourself and all that stuff it's all
done with this so that's really nice and
I really do like the product so you
definitely need to give it some time no
don't expect after one treatment for it
to work because it's not going to work
after one treatment it does take a while
so hopefully that was helpful if you
have any questions about the tria I
would be happy to answer as many as I
can down below or I can always contact
the company and ask them as well
so I want to thank you so much for
watching this video I hope you found it
helpful if you did definitely give it a
thumbs up because it makes me look cool
and subscribe for more content I mostly
do makeup videos so if you enjoy that
definitely hit the subscribe button and
share this with a friend who you think
may also need to know about the trio
mm-hmm cuz I don't know about you but I
hate shaving I absolutely hate it so
this is definitely been wonderful for me
so thanks Kim for watching mad love and
I'll see you soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
