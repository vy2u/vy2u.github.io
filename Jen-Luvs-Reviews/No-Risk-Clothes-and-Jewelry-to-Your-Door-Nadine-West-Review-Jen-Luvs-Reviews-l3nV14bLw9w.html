about Nadine West in quite a long time
but I got some particularly amazing
things this month so I wanted to show
you real quick this is gonna be a super
quick video just about Nadine West how
it works because I think it's an amazing
service and I think it's very unique and
I have some new subscribers and I don't
know if you've ever seen this before so
I wanted to tell you about it so Nadine
West is a clothing and jewelry
subscription service but it's very
different in that what they do is you
fill out a style profile and then they
send you two pieces of jewellery and a
shirt you can also request to just get
jewelry and no shirt I think this shirts
only go up to large size sometimes
they'll go up to extra-large but they
don't always have extra large so then
they'll send you jewelry in case you are
of those sizes so they send you one of
these pink epsy look in packages and
what you do is you open up everything
they tell you how much everything costs
and you have like really truly like five
or six days to hold on to it decide what
you want to do what if you don't like
things then what you do is you they have
sticky tape here and then they also give
you a packaging slip I'm not going to
show you the packaging so canseco my
address and everything on it but they
send you a prepaid packaging slip you
throw everything that you don't like
back into the into the mail earth you
seal it up with the tape you put the
package slip on it you stick it in your
mailbox and if you don't like anything
you pay for nothing absolutely nothing
you pay no shipping costs you pay no
restocking fee you pay nothing so it's
completely 100% risk-free I've done this
a lot I am I am a Nadine West affiliate
and that people sign up using my link
and I get three dollars if they sign up
using my link but other than that like
they don't I pay for everything that I
keep really and truly I just wanted to
show you this because it's a great
service and the people there are super
duper ooper nice so anyway so let me
show you what I got I'm actually wearing
everything that I got first thing I got
I'll show you I'll show you the jewelry
first and I'll show you the shirt let me
zoom up real quick so here is the
necklace that I got isn't that gorgeous
so it's kind of clinky clinky and then
let me show you just the back so there's
the way the clasp is in the back it's
one of those claw clasp I think that's
what it's called and you can adjust it
for size so if you want it to be longer
you can make it longer so
necklace is a little bit pricey but it's
very heavy it feels of very high quality
it's $24.99 and it's called the morning
to do a necklace and I do think I'm
going to keep this because I'm in love
with it that's my big thing when they
need a month I don't like is they send
me so much cute stuff that I feel I feel
like I have to buy everything every time
they send me stuff so it gets really
expensive for me because I can't say no
because I like the stuff so much you
know in a zone this is the necklace
$24.99 I'm totally keeping it let me
show you the earrings these are called
the falling star dangles and they're
14.99 but that's what those look like
they're they're relatively I don't know
they're their unique looking but they're
not obnoxious you know what I'm saying
like they're they're nice they're really
nice I like them a lot so if I were to
send anything back it would probably be
the earrings just because I feel like
1499 is a little bit overpriced for
something like this I think 1099 would
be a little bit more reasonable $9.99
something like that but I think with the
dangle in the middle I can see why
they're more and they are nice they are
really cute so I haven't decided on that
yet
so then the last thing is the shirt and
the shirts are typically less than $20
this one is 18 49 and it's called the
rosy cheeks top and this isn't a size
small and let me kind of show you what's
going on with this so I so I have a
white tank underneath it you have to
wear a tank under this unless you want
to show lots of skin you know I'm saying
girlfriends so let me show you so it's
got the bottom that comes down here and
then the bottom comes a little lower in
the back but it's got these crazy slits
up the side they come up very high on
the sides so you have to wear a tank
under it show you the back detailing I
saw the tag on it but there's the back
detail I haven't decided about this
shirt yet Jean really likes it I really
like it I'm probably ended up keeping
the shirts so really when it comes down
to us am I gonna keep earrings or not
I've no idea
I do have a few days to decide so I
don't know I haven't decided what do you
guys think do you think I should keep
the earrings I don't know what would you
keep I don't know but I did want to
present this subscription to you I don't
do it all the time I really just trying
to show you when I do have something
like SuperDuper amazing and I love the
