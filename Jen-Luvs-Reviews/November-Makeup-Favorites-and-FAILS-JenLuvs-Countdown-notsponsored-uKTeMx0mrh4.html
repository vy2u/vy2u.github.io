countdown this is my new version of a
monthly favorites video and I'm hoping
it will continue till the end of time
and that is what the goal is I'm
crossing my fingers I never make any
promises I'm just hoping at this point
because I really like this idea to do
this I'm hoping that it continues so
we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna
start with my least favourite product
and I tried this month and we're gonna
go all the way up to my favorite so here
we go with number 10 the least favorite
product that I have been using this
month is the NARS audacious mascara I
got this as a sample as a point perk
from Sephora this is probably one of the
worst mascaras I have ever tried I don't
know what NARS was thinking because from
the jump you can tell this is gonna be a
bad mascara check out this one what is
up with the spacing of those bristles I
don't know anybody that has eyelashes
they're gonna be able to benefit from
spacing of that the other thing is look
out gigantic this brushes it's huge it's
made for the eyes of a giant s it did
nothing it made some of my lashes darker
but I had to keep going because it
wasn't hitting my lashes because the
bristles are so far apart
it was terrible NARS if you're watching
this what is this what what's what
at number 9 this month we have morphe
eyeshadow palettes here comes the crash
of the world of makeup on YouTube
crashing down I don't like these pallets
this is the I'm gonna put the name of
these pallets here because I can't
remember them off the top of my head
this is not a bad palette it's just not
a good palette the eyeshadows in here
are mediocre and for all the hype that
these things get on YouTube
I always expecting really good quality
and I did not get that in this palette I
use these about six or seven times I
gave them a good college try they swatch
do
flame on the I they apply pretty well
the lasting power is atrocious every way
I've tried this I've tried this with
three different eyeshadow primers I've
tried them without eyeshadow primer they
do not last on my eyes that is a
personal experience if you love this
eyeshadow palette I am so happy for you
I wish I loved it I wanted to love this
that's why I bought it
I also did a build-your-own pout because
somebody told me that the ones that you
build your own the single pans are
better quality than the ones that are
not the single pan so I built this
palette and I can tell you that I like
the shimmery shades better than the
matte one which might be where this one
went wrong even like this shimmery shade
is pretty weak this one's pretty nice
this one is called bronze IV this is
probably my favorite one out of all the
morphe shadows that I got this bronzed
iv1
see if I can get that swatch there that
one is really really pretty they're
better than a typical drugstore palette
my ELF immediate new palette blows these
out of the water
my new essence palette that I got at
generation beauty blows these out of the
water my my NYX the to go palette blows
these out of the water so you can find
inexpensive eyeshadows that are better
than these I have heard that the three
3501 but one that was dying over was a
different formula than these which
really makes me sad when companies do
that because I lose brand loyalty when
companies do that so I'm hoping that you
know they'll be a little more consistent
and put out quality shadows and all
their palettes not just the ones that
are you know hyped up for one reason or
another at the Jaqueline help al at the
3500 you know so that's number nine
number eight this month is the Born This
Way Foundation by - face to face is one
of my favorite brands of all time and
this is kind of one of those on the
fence kind of products I do like this
product I like it for filming I like it
for when I do YouTube videos I do not
like this for a day-to-day foundation I
feel like it is too thick I do not feel
like it makes me look like I was born
this way if I was born with cake face
then yes I would have been born that way
maybe I'm just applying too much it
could be operator air
you never know what is going on there
could be other things going on but for
me this is not a natural looking
foundation it is a wonderful foundation
for somebody that wants a more full
coverage look but it's not born this way
I just feel like it's folks advertising
at least on my skin now we've got all
things that are amazing the next two
products are only in the middle because
of their price points because they're
stupid expensive the first one is this
Charlotte Tilbury
lipstick and Hepburn honey and I'm
actually going to remove my lip product
this is a wonderful lipstick it is very
moisturizing it feels very good on the
lips it smells really good
it's got like a vanilla cream kind of
scent to it it just feels good on the
lips it's not too soft it's not hard in
any way it just feels good it feels like
a nice lipstick you know what I'm saying
it could be placebo effect I don't know
but for me it feels really good and it
makes me very happy and I'm happy that I
have one Charlotte Tilbury lipstick will
I buy more
maybe one day I'll buy another one but
I'm not rushing out to the store to get
more but the one that I have I'm pretty
happy to have at number six this month
we have the Kevin a Quon contour book
vol 2 the art of sculpting and defining
this is my new baby I love it it makes
me so happy the only reason why it's
down this low on the list is because of
the price point because it's stupid
expensive me I look that these create
like the heavens opened up and sang when
I use these eyeshadows together the
powder contour here it works like a
dream like a dream the cream contour
works very well the candlelight powder
is very very famous it is kind of I
don't know see I like my highlights to
be a little more poppy this one is a
nice highlight if you want one that's a
highlight but it's a little more subtle
the cream highlight does not do much for
me it isn't very opaque it doesn't I
don't know it's just not very good in my
opinion but the rest of the palette is
like
so yes this is definitely a favorite for
the month at number five this month I do
not have a full-size of it I just have a
sample of it and if you have been with
me on periscope you know the love that
comes out of my heart when I speak about
Eden Eden is an Urban Decay eyeshadow
primer potion Oh Eden Eden Eden I love
you
Eden came to me as a sample and Eden is
almost gone I might even gonna squeeze
any more out of it just know that it is
a matte eyeshadow primer that goes on
like a dream keeps my eyeshadows on all
day long the only reason why is this
number five is because it's not stinking
available anymore why send out a sample
urban decay of something you can't even
buy anymore it's not on the website I
was very upset to find out that they
changed this it's like why why why get
me hooked on something and it's not even
available anymore so it's amazing and
I'm mad at urban decay that's the end of
number five number four this month is a
mascara that caught me completely
off-guard
I had no idea that this was going to be
what it is and I am dying it is the
steal a huge extreme lash mascara
it says mascara SILS on it this is the
deluxe sample size I got it in my
Birchbox I believe and holy moly is this
probably the best mascara I've ever used
and that is saying a lot and I do say
that every once in a while but it's the
best mascara I've ever used until I find
something that I think is better and I
think that this is better it's got the
same kind of wand as the better than sex
mascara I was trying out some new
mascaras on periscope I know I keep
talking about it I was trying out some
new mascaras I'm ladi Dadi Dom's like
this is just not doing it for me it's
not doing it for me and I'm trying to
annoy my stare it's not doing it for me
and I was like okay I got this anyone
from still - let's try it out and I went
boom and everybody on periscope went oh
that's it it did it you've got mascara
it worked and it's like yes it worked
it's like I felt like Eureka you know I
felt like you know 88
thousand hours freaked out because this
is just an amazing mascara and then
again no flaking no nothing just amazing
ful amazing lashes the only thing is is
it is kind of a wet mascara so if you
don't like wet mascaras you may not like
this cuz it kind of clumps a little bit
so you gotta kind of wiggle wiggle
wiggle to get the clumps out a little
bit but be still my heart
be still my heart at number three is a
product that saved my lips I have the
only issue that I have on my entire face
that I hate as far as my skin stuff that
Pokemon is this dry patch I always get
in the center of my bottom lip no matter
what I do
I have tried let me show you the lip
balms this is my bag of lip balms none
of these work on my dry spot none of
them a lot of them are very nice very
very nice lip balms but they don't work
on my dry spot I can't take credit for
all this a lot of this is my husband but
still I've tried them all none of them
work I finally found something that
works and it is the bite agave lip mask
I got this one from my friend Shannon in
Canada this is the maple one this is
amazing and then this is the regular one
that I got at the bite Beauty store in
New York City this saved my lips my lips
have never been softer since I've been
any kind of recent memory since I've
been using these it is a very thick
consistency though so if you don't like
the consistency you probably won't be
able like this at all
but if you can get past the thickness it
is so amazing the number one ingredient
in this is lanolin which is the number
one in the only ingredient in the
nursing medication that women use called
lansinoh it's in a purple tube you can
get it at Target
but there's other magical miss mixed in
with this that make it even better than
that because I've used that on my lips
and even that doesn't really a hundred
percent get rid of my dry spot like it
helps but it's not like this there's
something magical in these tubes and I
don't know what it is but if I could
bottle it and sell it I would be bite
Beauty and I'll be making a lot of money
and I would have people on YouTube
saying how amazing the product is that
was a little bit circular wasn't it
number two is an oldie for most people
and a goodie but it's new for me the Too
Faced chocolate bar palette I broke down
and got this I can't even tell you how
many times I've walked by this palette
in a store going I don't need it I don't
need it I'm gonna hold my nose so that
don't smell the amazingness of this
palette as I walk by it because I don't
need another neutral palette
turns out I needed another neutral
palette it turns out I needed the
chocolate bar palette specifically I can
smell it over here okay this is not just
another neutral palette oh no it's not
the shades in here are so complex and
magical I have never in my life seen
some of the shades that are in here the
undertones the duochrome ness and also
the matte shades are amazing in here
there is something magical in this
palette and it's beyond the cocoa powder
it's beyond that their shades are just
this one alone creme brulee is like a
dream it is a dream come true shade for
me another one that I absolutely love is
hazelnut and then will swatch um
champagne truffle those are ones I've
been using quite a bit like what what
what I think it speaks for itself
and all of everybody in the world loving
this palette speaks for it it's just in
my wildest dreams I could never come up
with a better palate than this like I
compare this this is like the my husband
of eyeshadow palettes like if I saw all
people lined up and I could pick any guy
to be with them in life I would pick my
husband if I could pick any eyeshadow
palette to exist in the world it will be
the Too Faced it's magical there's
something special it's like my soulmate
of eyeshadow palettes it really is but
beyond that in the number one spot this
month because it caught me by surprise
this one I knew I was gonna like this is
what I knew I was gonna like this one
caught me by surprise in the best way
possible
it's little jar right here this is the
bare minerals concealer multitasking SPF
20 concealer in summer bisque I got this
in a bare minerals mystery bag
I wasn't expecting it and I put it on my
undereyes and I went what what is that
real did that really just happen to my
undereyes like are you kidding me it is
the best under eye correcting concealer
I have ever used I can't I can't even
believe that this is real like when I
put it on I'm thinking powder concealer
whatever like that's not gonna be able
to do anything it's just gonna blend
away whatever I'm your girlfriend mm-hmm
and everybody that I've talked to about
this concealer loves it as well I
haven't heard any negative reviews of
this it's wonderful except for though no
that was one that said there was a
little bit of creasing happening and
that was it but overall a huge huge win
for this because it caught me so off
guard and it's so amazing and I can't
stop using it I just can't there's no
other concealer that I want to use ever
again for the rest of my life this is
fine for me I'm good now so that's it
