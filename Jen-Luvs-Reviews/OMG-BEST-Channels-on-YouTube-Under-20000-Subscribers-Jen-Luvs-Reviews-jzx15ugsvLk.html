kind of video from me I've been thinking
about making this video for a really
long time but a big reason why I haven't
is I don't want to make anyone sad that
I didn't talk about them just because I
don't talk about you if I you're a
friend of mine I have a lot of friends
that make youtube videos doesn't mean
that I don't absolutely love your
channel these three channels have really
been standing out to me as being
absolutely sinking amazing and I can't
believe that they don't have a bigger
audience and also I really feel like you
need to know about that because I think
you'll really love them and I think that
you will enjoy watching their videos and
I want to bring that to you so I have
chosen them very strategically because
they have three very different styles of
channel let's go ahead and start with
the very first channel which is a
tutorial channel her name is Julia
salvia and what really impressed me with
her channel was that she did a 31 days I
believe of Halloween tutorials I
seriously have never seen a more
hard-working youtuber than Julia she's
insanely insanely dedicated she is a
full-time student yet she also dedicates
so much time and passion to her channel
and I just I'm blown away by her
dedication I had the fabulous
opportunity to meet Julia at a couple of
generation Beauty events generation
Beauty is an Ipsy event I do have a full
video about that I'll link that down
below but generation Beauty is a great
place to meet other creators and I was
so thankful to have been able to meet
Julia there she really does have a
phenomenal channel and the biggest thing
is that she just does a really good job
with her makeup she's really really
really talented and she does a variety
of things she does more wearable looks
she does more bold look she does more
artistic looks things like that so if
you were a tutorial junkie you
definitely want to check out Julia's
channel she is amazing and she is such a
sweet person to her channel just
deserves to skyrocket so I hope you love
her as much as I do the second channel
is actually I don't I don't really have
a great personal kind
connection with her I haven't really
connected on a person-to-person basis
with her but recently especially I have
just been like oh my gosh what a
phenomenal channel her name is the
dreamcatcher and the first thing you
notice about Vee is that her makeups
always on point like really on point
really really good she is a primarily a
review channel and you know how much I
love my review channels that's my thing
so in order for me to like say that a
review channel is on point and amazing
it takes a lot for me to say that the
last channel review channel that I
predicted was gonna blow up was Cassie
from thrift thick and she did her
channel is now quite a bit larger than
mine even the one before that was
Jessica from Jam Beauty 89 was the
channel that I predicted was going to
blow up so V I know she is on her way
because I know that as soon as people
find her videos today they will fall in
love with her you are going to fall in
love with her reviews are thorough
they're interesting they're well
researched she doesn't just you know say
something is good because it has a lot
hype behind you can tell she really
thinks about you know the performance of
a product before she says something she
doesn't just let anything fall out of
her face and I know I know you know
those channels that they kind of just
gotta go with what everybody else says
is good and you can tell they just
didn't really think much about it that
is the opposite of V you can tell that
she really puts a lot of heart into her
videos she also does those follow me
around where tests which are really cute
toffee from glam life guru does them
Cassie from thrift thik does them
they're super cute and I really really
love watching her go through her day she
edited edits it very well so you don't
feel like you're seeing too much of her
day but just enough to kind of get it I
feel for what her day is like and then
she does her check-ins for the product
that she's testing and it's just it's
just a really solid legit review channel
so definitely check the out I don't
think that you will be disappointed at
all and the last channel is a channel
that I have been subscribed to for a
really long time she actually doesn't
live that far from me but we've never
met in person and the channel is called
the plainest Jane she is a
she's more of a vlogger I think like a
superwoman or channels like that where
you know she's quick she's funny she's
smart and it's like every time I watch
one of her videos I'm like yes you know
when you watch a video and just
resonates with you so much and you're
like yes that that is exactly how I feel
thank you so much Jane for doing that
video because it just makes you feel
like there's someone else that
understands where you're coming from she
does these really cool videos where she
asks questions rapid-fire questions to
get people thinking about different
things which do you think is more
deceiving push-up bras or excessive
makeup are you ever truly yourself like
you're real honest genuine self on a
first date or are you sometimes nervous
and timid do you think other boots will
ever die what's one thing you cannot
cannot cannot leave the house without
and don't say your phone do you believe
in New Year's resolution so do you think
the whole year should be based on self
evolution that you brush your teeth once
or twice a day look I got a lot of me
and Siddhas questioning your head and
make some improvements yeah and it's so
interesting because she goes so fast
sometimes I just have like the pause
because I really want to take time to
think about the answer to her question
and it like she just kind of rattles
them off and it's so fun to watch
because the questions are just really
really really interesting and kind of
get you thinking about different things
the other thing I love about Jane is
that she's very positive minded she's
always says make sure you get something
good done today I can't forget forget
what her exact wording is but do
something productive today you know like
she's always trying to motivate her
viewers to do something with their lives
to go out and make their lives
meaningful and I just appreciate that so
much about her I just adore her she
always responds back to my comments to
which I really really really like she's
just sick smart I think that's the big
thing I love about Jane is she's just
really really smart and if you like
those intellectual vloggy
make you think about life kinds of
channels you will love the plane has
changed and that's it for this shutout
video I hope you enjoyed it and I hope
you check out at least one if not all of
these channels because they really are
amazing to the point where I felt like I
needed to make a video about it like
there
amazing so I hope that you enjoy them
definitely tell them I sent you when you
went over there leave comments down
below letting me know who you went to
check out and if you like them or not I
just really want them to grow and I
really want to expose them to you
because I think you will love them I
genuinely do so enough blabber I will
see you guys in a video very very soon
mad love have a great week take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
