month of glamour doll eyes now this is a
very different kind of subscription it's
not a subscription box it comes in this
bag here and it's it's an eyeshadow
subscription you get a limited edition
glamour doll eyes eyeshadow i think it's
only given away in the subscription now
you can't just sign up for it and have
it sent you every month is what i
understand i think there's a way to do
that but then you gotta like hit it at
the right time i'll have all the
information down below about how to sign
up for this it's a little tricky a
little funky but i've really enjoyed it
so far i got a gorgeous gorgeous like
rose gold pinky was him rose gold it was
like pink with gold in it I can't even
call rose gold it was gorgeous when I
got the pink one um and that a bright
blue one and then this is I believe my
third one so very excited to get this I
usually throw in something else in there
as well I got a lipstick a lip gloss
sample I got a really cool it was almost
like the lorac whether the liquid drops
that you put on your eyeshadow to make
it a little shimmery that was really
cool so they show that usually throw in
something a little extra in there as
well I know it's somewhere around six
dollars a month it just kind of depends
on how you sign up for it but I'll put
all the information down below and also
just so you know I do get this as a
promotional subscription but it does not
influence my review in any way I will be
completely honest about what my opinions
about what's inside this bag so let's go
ahead and find out so I see purple and
usually the packaging matches the
whatever the contents are so that means
we're probably getting a purple
eyeshadow and purple happens to be my
favorite color but this is the thing of
hogwash I usually purple eyeshadow is
turning grey on me they look horrible
they never stay purple except for bare
minerals bare minerals is the only one
that will stay true purple so first
thing they gave us usually it was some
kind of candy delicacy here and delicacy
it's grape eggs all right I've never had
great pegs actually I've had lemon heads
but never great head so I'm anxious to
try those let's try what let's see how
these
repense Jason because I know that's why
you really are here wha I was a sour
scrap ever tasted not quite delicious oh
I get that feeling back here Oh whoo now
it's gonna be stuck in my teeth all
right Oh a glitter tube and it's on let
me show you this picture you garcias
picture check that out so it's it's a
glitter and it's shown on lips how does
that work there's only one way to find
out how this works should i try it oh
i'm scared i'm scurred should I make the
purple lips happen should i do it you
guys know you want me to look ridiculous
of course I have no idea what I'm doing
I'm just gonna press it on my lipstick
that I got on let's see what happened
I'm skirt I'm skirt I don't know what
I'm doing what is happening here I'm
assuming you're supposed to make it
opaque cuz it's really pretty like I
don't know if you can see that it's
purple with like these pink glitters in
it I don't think I'm supposed to be
rubbing it together it's working really
well holy moly that's insane it's
sticking really well feels a little
sandy and dry I don't know if I'd be
able to tolerate this like for an
evening I look ridiculous don't I I
don't know on the right person this will
look good they're not go kissing anybody
you know do I look glamorous makes my
teeth look yellow you so this is very
interesting I look a little on the
creepy side but just bear with me bear
with me my friend I feel like I got a
little in my teeth which cannot be a
good thing i'm assuming could use this
on your eyes though too i don'ti don't
know how much I'm going to use this but
that's okay this is my glamour doll eyes
I wonder if this is the actual eye
shadow that would be weird nope there's
an actual glamour doll eyes thing here
okay there's cards in here that explain
what everything is but I just don't do
that all right this is called Foyle me
my glamour doll eyes I don't know what
that is i'm going to have to look that
up and then this is the actual eye
shadow and it is purple my lips are very
distracting haha this is a lot of stuff
to include if you think you're paying
you
six seven dollars for this and once
again no scepter feel like I'm getting
sand in my teeth by going to a purple
beach okay so here's the swatch of the
purple pretty very pretty and this is
the way that it looks in the pan let's
do a double swatch really pretty I like
the blue shifts in there very pretty it
did take those two swatches so I'm going
to have to make sure i use a dense flat
brush so really pack on the color if I
decide to use this all over my lid I
think this is going to be really pretty
in the crease though with maybe like a
like a teal or leave me my teal but like
a light blue with this in the crease
would be really really pretty or even a
gray with this in the crease would be
really pretty so we'll have to try that
okay I'm going to take out break down
and take out the cards now because it
tells me what everything is okay so it
says the eyeshadow is a medium purple
with subtle coppery pink undertone and
blue sparkle and it says my dismay
glitter tube and foil me so it says
predominantly purple with sparkles of
pink and a tiny bit of black let me say
what it is though cooter used to be a
big seller here at gde and we have been
asked a lot to bring them back we're now
introducing our glitter tubes and you
get the first look all the all glitters
will be custom blends and their official
release date will be Monday May
nineteenth we're also including a sample
of our foil me solution which will aid
in cosmetic application foil and glitter
adhesion if you choose interesting cool
and then my dismay glitter tube and
flail me so that it's predominantly
purple with sparkles of pink and a tiny
bit of black that's what I have oman
lips no wonder how it looks so weird and
creepy so and then it gives you
directions on how to use a foil me cool
okay so basically what you do is you put
the the foil me down let me show you
where did that go I lost it whoo it's
like straight liquid in here yeah this
packaging did not work so well my
friends so it's like a liquid in there
I'm not going to touch it cuz I actually
want to use it and you mix it with your
shadow and it creates like a foiled
effect very interesting so we'll have to
try
I'll let you know very interesting so
that's it for a glamour doll eyes for
this month I'm really happy about the
purple shadow love me some purple shadow
I don't know if I'm gonna use this very
much it's not really my style but you
know we'll find something to do with it
and then the foil me will try that I'm
curious to try that to make liner out of
eyeshadows I think that'll be really
cool a happy about the candy cuz it was
delicious even though it was sour and
yeah and that's it for the glamour doll
