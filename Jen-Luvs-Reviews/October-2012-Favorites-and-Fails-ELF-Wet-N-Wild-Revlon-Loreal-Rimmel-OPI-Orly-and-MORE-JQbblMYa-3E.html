October favorites video I have so much
to show you because I got a lot of drug
store stuff this month I did the
twenty-dollar makeup challenge this
month so I have products from that some
good some not so good and also a lot of
other things including some nail polish
so stay tuned and i will show you what I
got what's you know what let's let's the
edgy let's start off with all the nail
polishes that I got all right there was
a sale at Ulta buy two get one free orly
nail polishes but I don't have any orly
nail polishes and I wanted to try them
so i ended up getting three and they're
all quite different I'll show you my
least favorite one first which was this
right here it is blue really blue it's
in royal navy and i'll show you that
what that looks like right there and
this one I thought be more with a comer
maybe kind of color I thought that the
shimmer would shine through a little bit
more than it does so I don't know how
much I'm going to be using this in the
future I was disappointed in that second
one I was also a little weirded out by
this is the one in space cadet it looks
really cool in the bottle and it looked
the same on my nail but it kind of
reminds me of poison ivy was that in
Batman I think oh gosh I hope I got that
right in bad man it's this very strange
color I might wear it every once in a
while its kind of fall issue I don't
know we'll see about that that's a maybe
I'm not real sure about that maybe it
every once in a while one but this one I
really really liked and this one was
enraged and this one's just a beautiful
I don't even know what to call that like
a almost got a penny copper but really
light like a light copper you have a
better name for this let me know other
than rage because rage doesn't really
give it away but this one was just
gorgeous and I had to wear
this one a lot I love this one and I
feel like you could use this one for a
fall you could use it for a spring for
your summer about winter yeah I guess
you could use it for winter too I really
like this color this one was definitely
my favorite the nail those the orly nail
polishes that I got I also got a
seasonal nail polish I got this one by
sinful colors and it is in the color
pumpkin spice and you can kind of see I
did um an orange one and a black one to
kind of show you I don't know this is
kind of hit or miss but when I had
longer nails when my nails were
healthier when I wasn't wearing nail
polish every day I just put it on the
tip of the orange and that looked really
really really pretty I also tried it
over all red and it looked very
Christmasy so I might save that for the
holiday season as it gets closer to
Christmas the other thing that I thought
was on that sneak peek website that I
talked about in my last month's video I
finally got myself from sneak peek
ridiculous but I got to shatter OPI nail
polishes this one's in silver and I put
that over at the blue orly nail polish
that I got also i put gold over top of
black i'm not quite sure what i think of
the shadow nail polishes they're really
interesting looking they're definitely
not it going to be an everyday for me
but definitely when I'm feeling a little
edgy i might go the shadow root one
trick that I learned about the shatter
polishes which probably isn't a trick
because if you shower polishes you
realize it pretty much right away that
if you put too thick of a code on it
doesn't work it doesn't shatter so you
got to make sure you put like a
relatively thin coat on so that's it for
polishes next up I'm going to talk about
the products that I got for the
twenty-dollar makeup challenge we'll
start with foundation this was the elf
flawless finish foundation I'm not put
this on my face since the 2000 makeup
challenge and it is going in my bag of
stuff that I don't like that i have for
random reason this stuff had way too
much coverage for me I felt like it just
it just looks weird if you saw twenty on
makeup challenge to just see how weird
my face looks oh did not look nice at
all this stuff was terrible also for the
challenge I had gotten this la splash
purple I liquid eyeliner and it you see
it's in the color purple heart
I really wanted to like this I really
really really wanted to like this and I
don't I don't like the way it transfers
even over a black liner which was kind
of what my intention was to do with it
the purple doesn't show up clean and
even the glitter I'm not it just looks
messy when you put it on when it comes
down to it just looks messy okay I can't
show you this anymore because it dried
up but the elf waterproof eyeliner pen I
like the line that it drew the staying
power on this thing is horrible so I
wore this a cup one time to work and by
the end of the day it was like peeling
off in section I I don't rub my eyes
during the day I'm pretty good about
that and it was like it was coming off
also my eye the skin on my eyes isn't as
firm as it used to be so when I'm trying
to use a pen eyeliner it doesn't go on
smoothly I don't know if you have more
taut eyelids if it would work better for
you but for me it did not work for me at
all also the the marker color kind of
sinks into my fine lines which is not
good either so no on the elf waterproof
eyeliner pen either one that I was
really shocked with really shocked was
the elf mascara now I don't know what
it's called anymore because all of the
print has wiped off of his somehow I
actually have been using this and this
is in black and my only complaint is the
more I use it the more clumpy it gets
but if you're real gentle with it and
roll diligent at making it go over your
lashes it works great it really does and
this was a dollars the only other
complaint i have about this is it is
quite heavy on my lashes i can really
feel it for the first few minutes that
I'm wearing it until I get used to it
but I really liked this mascara I was
shocked it lengthens it thickens and but
like I said it does get a little puppy
so you just have to make sure you work
with it to get the clothes out so that
it um it doesn't stay that way but yeah
I like this better than a lot of the
drugstore mascara
I've been getting lately like it oh the
other thing that I was very unhappy with
in my tutorial I'm not tutorial it was
deadly not a tutorial and my 20 on
makeup challenge was the elf contouring
blush and bronzer now that I've been
using it with an actual brush I do like
it I recently got in on the NARS
foreplay which includes orgasm which is
same this is kind of like the people say
is a dupe for orgasm and laguna and the
bronzer from NARS they're similar in
color i will say that but the staying
power and the quality i'm sorry are not
the same you can't get three dollars the
same as you know thirty dollars or
whatever it just it's there's a reason
why in my opinion ours is more expensive
than this it is highly pigmented as
you'll be able to see but it doesn't
blend as easily as the NARS um and it's
AIT's the staying power isn't as good if
you're not willing to spend what NARS
costs for orgasm and laguna this is a
good alternative but don't expect the
same quality the last thing that i got
for the challenge was the wet and wild
trio of cool as a cucumber and i use
this quite often actually and more crazy
about the light green and the dark green
then i am about the purple the purple is
a little weird for me it's a little
harder to blend but the the greens i
really am enjoying if you're looking for
a drugstore eyeshadow that is
inexpensive and works well i would
definitely recommend these now other
things that I got this month like hot
foam wears it up I've got Revlon
Colorstay and I absolutely love it it's
taken me a little while to get used to
it using my brush the first few times I
used it it went on way too thick it was
too much coverage I looked very
plasticky but now I learned to dab the
foundation on my face and however much I
would use and then blend it with the
brush instead of you know pouring some
in my hand and dipping in the bus like i
was with my maybelline fit me foundation
it worked fine for that foundation not
for this because this is so high
coverage so that's my only warning on
this end
lives up to what everyone says about
Revlon Colorstay it is fabulous it stays
on it um doesn't make my face super
shiny I just I'm really enjoying this a
lot the other thing that I got that
there was a lot of hype about there has
been a lot of hype about if you watch a
lot of beauty videos on YouTube is the
Rimmel stay matte powder press powder
love this stuff it makes my face very
matte which I love I don't like my face
to be shiny it freaks me out I don't
mind a little bit of shine every once in
a while like if it's like a shimmer in a
blush or my new high beam that I got
which I'll talk about next month I don't
mind that kind of shine but when my nose
is shiny my forehead shiny it's like a
look this keeps the shine away and i
love it and it was cheap also i got a
knicks mega shine lipgloss it was on
sale at Ulta so I ended up picking it up
in baby rose because someone said that
it was I don't even know who it was I'm
starting to write down who tells me
these wonderful things that I can give
them credit in my videos but this NYX
lip gloss is very ordinary it has a
really nice smell my daughter says it
smells like watermelon I don't think
it's quite watermelon you know what it
smells like to me it smells like candy
that you get from a gumball machine it's
very sugary smelling and the smells
wonderful i love it i mean it's just a
plain gloss it's nothing amazing it's
quite shiny um if you're not don't like
a whole bunch of shine on your lips you
probably won't like this but i really do
like it a lot i got all these things
that i've heard about so much on on
youtube this one I got some Revlon
age-defying moisturizing concealer and
this was in the discount bin at Ulta I
was so excited I saw it and I scooped up
even though my half concealer have but I
have a high-end concealer it cost me
like 20 bucks and I like this just as
much as my high-end concealer I don't
know what it is I'll put a note next to
me what might one that i have is but
this Revlon angel flying concealer is
fabulous I love it
it covers up my little circles it any
kind of discoloration I have in my face
it takes care of it um yeah I love this
stuff another thing that I got was
Revlon lip butter and creme brulee and
this has become my favorite fall lip
color I love the stuff absolutely love
it it is gorgeous and what I love about
it is it's very neutral but I can put
different glosses over and it will
totally change the look of the lip color
I actually I'm looking for another one
of these because I'm currently having a
giveaway which i will put the link down
below to the giveaway video and if I can
find another one of these it's going to
be part of the giveaway along with some
urban decay eyeshadows and some biosilk
like something would smoothing stuff and
some some support cream blush which is
my absolute favorite and some china
glaze nail polishes if you want to win
that make sure you check out the link
below and put a comment so that you can
the answer to win the last thing that
I've got is um something that was rare I
know this was Emily no well if you don't
know Emily Noel she is fabulous for Meg
reviews this woman knows about every
single product I can't even imagine what
her storage system looks like four
strong old makeup this woman has she's
gorgeous she does her makeup beautifully
her tutorials are amazing and she just
has a she always has the best advice for
her makeup and she recommended this
double extends mascara i get to ulta and
i'm looking for double x mi ser Davos
and mascara I'm looking forward
everywhere finally I see it I say oh
there it is and then I look down then
that's like oh there's another one that
says double extender what's the
difference and I start looking at it and
I'm like oh there's another one that one
says double extends so there's a picture
of all the double extend mascara is that
i found that seemed to be no difference
from one from the other except for the
color of the packaging of it so i ended
up taking the red because i like Fred
I just thought it was pretty I don't
know I have learned through this that I
love lash primer I have so much trouble
making my lashes long I have the
shortest w eyelashes ever so this has
worked beautifully for me if you have
short stubby lashes I recommend that you
check this out the Prime on one side and
the mascara on the other side so it's a
step one step two deal there aren't any
fibers or anything crazy that lengthen
which is fine with me but I do love this
