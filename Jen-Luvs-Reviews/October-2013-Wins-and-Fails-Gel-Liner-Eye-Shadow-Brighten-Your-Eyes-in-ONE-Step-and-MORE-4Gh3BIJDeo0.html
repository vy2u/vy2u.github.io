favorites i'm going to jump right in
I've got some wins for you I got some
fails for you first win is the merit I
have a first win is the Mary Kay eye
makeup remover it is amazing like one
swipe and you're getting most of your
makeup off make off makeup get most of
your makeup on if you have waterproof
makeup it'll take it off in just a few
sweeps excellent excellent excellent
product next up is a product i want to
show you because sila is actually
getting them getting rid of them they're
going out of their line you can find
them for sale lots of places they've
been on hold with a couple of times I
seen them at nordstrom rack the original
price on these were 22 dollars each I
got two of them at full price because
they were so amazing and now I have this
many of them between the the sale and
the ones i had already had full price
they are the selah countless color
pigments they are amazing you're having
to get them for that much longer so jump
on them if you find them you can find
them sometimes for six dollars eight
dollars nine dollars and I think that
that's totally totally worth it and let
me show you why and I will get your
lunch in two seconds let me just finish
explaining this real quick just one
eyeshadow okay okay so with the
countless color pigments of course their
countless color they the colors kind of
blend into each other this one is my
favorite in center stage it is
absolutely beautiful you can just get
the blue just get this orange color just
get this pinkish purple let me back it
up a little bit so you can really see
and then show you how those swatch just
gorgeous or you can blend them together
and get this really cool iridescent
color I absolutely love center stage and
this one I've seen a lot places I think
it might be scary to some people but it
is beautiful
the next one I wanted to show you is in
acoustic this one's a little more of a
natural tone you get like a reddish
color that can really blend nicely onto
the brow bone with this brown and the
brown is very very warm show you what
that looks like you've got this neutral
color that's beautiful beautiful for lid
or brow bone depending on your skin tone
and then this reddish color and you can
see how those go or you can kind of
brush them all together and they really
pretty much just turn into the brown
tone when you brush them together but
those are two of the highlights one
that's kind of a neutral one that's not
but there isn't a single one of these
that I don't love so if you happen to
run into these on sale I highly suggest
you pick up whichever colors appeal to
you I got these in my Ipsy bag and I was
really upset about it I don't usually
like to get shampoo and conditioner in
the subscription boxes because I feel
like especially if it's a drugstore
shampoo conditioner is something that's
not going to be expensive for me to try
I'd rather try something that is a
little less accessible if that makes
sense the full body shampoo and
conditioner there by John Frieda and I
loved these I wouldn't say they're in
any way like a Holy Grail or anything
but they were really nice I love the way
my hair felt I felt like my hair was
nourished I definitely this is probably
the best shampoo and conditioner and i
have used in a very long time i
typically buy my shampoo and conditioner
from either marshals or TJ maxx because
i feel like i can get a discount on
something that's typically more
expensive i normally don't buy drugstore
shampoo but i was very pleasantly
surprised by these these definitely be
out any drug any higher end shampoos and
conditioners that I've gotten from those
discount stores recently uh next up I
got this in my birchbox just a few
videos ago and it was the 12 benefits
instant healthy hair treatment I gotten
the it's a 10 miracle leave-in light and
I absolutely love this this is pretty
much gone love this did not like this
one as much this one is
the one with keratin I think I got both
of these in new beauty test tube love
this didn't like this so much but I feel
like this one beats out both of them by
far I love the texture of my hair it
doesn't weigh it down it changed my
flyaways I've gotten compliments on my
hair every time I've used this highly
highly highly recommend this one okay
next up is a fail and that is the Rimmel
fix and perfect pro primer this to me
was just a moisturizer it did not feel
like it smooths or resurfaced or Britain
or modified or protected my mom maybe it
protected my skin I don't know it's not
something I can really measure just by
visuals I just fell like this was a
moisturizer I would not recommend this
even for the inexpensive price next up I
have a lipstick formula that I want to
talk to you about and that is the NYX
black label lipstick I got a couple of
these from the sale Nix had a forty
percent off sale not that long ago and I
got one and this one's in DVD ba and
this one is in socialite I really like
this formula it's moisturizing the smell
there's a kind of a little bit of a
fruity smell to it but it's not
offensive or strong in any way let me
kind of swatch those for you so this one
is in diva diva and then this one is
socialite life and you can see the rich
pigmentation and those but what I like
about these is that they're definitely
buildable you can start off with just a
pat of it see if you like it maybe throw
some gloss over it when you like
something that's more opaque these will
work as well just really enjoyed this
formula I was surprised at how much I
liked it so if you happen to see these
somewhere and you can swatch them or you
want to pick up one and just try it out
i would recommend them now next up is
the ponds BB cream now I got both of
these in an influencer box and I was
really thankful to get both the medium
and the light because what I found is I
need to mix both the medium and the
light together in order to get my skin
tone I do about half and how or what
i'll do is i have foundations if i want
a little bit more coverage i'll mix one
into a foundation that maybe is a little
too light or a little too dark these
give a really nice light coverage I
don't feel like they last as well as
some of the higher-end BB creams that
I've tried but they are nice for the
price and especially mixed with a
foundation I feel like
they really really work well I'd like to
mix them with my covergirl three-in-one
especially that one is a little bit too
late for me the color that I haven't
forget what shade it is but I'd mix the
medium into it and it's perfect oh look
has had a sale on rain cosmetic the only
things I've like so far that I've tried
by rain are the the duo eyeshadow that i
got and then this gel liner
unfortunately this gel liner did come
with this big crack in the center of it
i did contact hautelook they did give me
my money back actually for my entire
order which I was very thankful for but
even with the big crack the actual
formula of this eyeliner is wonderful it
has a very long lasting power goes on
very smooth very opaque really really
like this formula if you happen to run
into rain cosmetics and if it comes
crack but look we'll give you your money
back so that's a good thing maybe not
for your whole order I think that was a
mistake but but still I mean it's a
really really nice formula also this
month something I've been reaching for a
lot is my NYX wonder pencil I dropped it
okay so my next wonder pencil this thing
is amazing I had my first pencil that I
used like this was the scandalized by
Rimmel this one is nice you're supposed
to put it in your waterline to brighten
up your eye I feel like it's not very
natural looking at goes on a little bit
cakey this one on the other hand I don't
know if you're gonna be able to tell the
difference there but this one goes on a
lot more natural I feel like when I put
it in my waterline it just kind of
brightens everything up also kind of put
it in my tear duct to kind of brighten
up just the overall look of my shadow
I've use it as a concealer as it
recommends that I've really liked it for
it's not my favorite concealer I more
really love this product for the
brightening of the eyes and it is just a
wonderful product the lasting power is
fantastic even in my waterline and I
can't believe I never hear anybody talk
about this product I absolutely love it
I also have one of these by chela that I
got in a beauty box this one is also
kind of cakey looking I think it's got
good intentions but I just don't think
that these live up to this one if I
didn't have this one I wouldn't know any
better and think that these were pretty
good but this one just blows it away so
definitely definitely definitely
recommend the knicks wonder pencil the
last one is this lorac palette
in downtown drama now I did get this at
nordstrom rack it was i did pay the full
price of twelve dollars for it i think
this is one of their old pallets but it
mean it's just absolutely beautiful you
show you what that looks like you've got
the mirror there and then you've got
these shadows here and I will swatch
them for you there happen to be five so
I have five fingers I'm just going to do
single yes I have five fingers though so
these colors are just absolutely
beautiful me tell you swatch them for
you you this is one swipe you I mean
just absolutely gorgeous so make sure
you can see those those are like the
messy swatches I've ever made but
they're really really pretty very very
pigmented easy to blend super super
happy with every shade in here this
purple didn't swatch very well I think
it's because of the bump in my arm but
but yeah I mean just gorgeous gorgeous
gorgeous shades the packaging is just
super super cute it's very sleek very
small very nice for travel very durable
it's got the magnetic closure on the
front and a little mirror and everything
I mean just super super super cute and
for 12 bucks you just can't beat that so
