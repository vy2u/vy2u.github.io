hundred thousandth review on YouTube of
the honest Accio subculture palette I do
still have a lot I want to share with
you so hang tight we're gonna get into
it right now in case you happen to have
not been on YouTube for the past few
weeks this is the anasazi a subculture
pellet just google it real quick and
you'll know why there's a looping
controversy going on so in a nutshell
what happened was that honest Asya
reformulated their eyeshadow didn't tell
anybody and then released it and people
were like this is something's going on
here it's not the same as what we're
used to
we're gonna talk about the the places
where I feel like honest oz you don't
really messed up on this but we're also
gonna talk about this palette as a whole
as far as whether I think that this is a
good palette or not and I'm gonna give
you a lot of detail so you can decide
whether it's good for you or not my
videos are really really long I do have
skip ahead buttons down below if you
want to skip to the next section
everyone's got their preferences of
which parts of my videos they like the
best
but anyway let's just get into the
details of this palette this palette is
$42 as of the filming of this video you
can get it in many many places including
the Anasazi Beverly Hills website
Sephora
Ulta Macy's Dillard's did I get them all
om Beauty lish and beauty less you could
get this it's the same price everywhere
it just depends on where you can get the
best shipping cost
it is a cruelty free product and it is
made in the United States one of the big
questions I get asked about this is in
comparison with the modern renaissance
what's it like as far as price and value
so this is the modern renaissance it's
got the same velvet packaging it's got
the exact same amount of product it is
the exact same price the pans are
exactly the same size those are pretty
much the only things that these palettes
have in common other than that they're
made by anastasi Beverly Hills they both
come with a brush other than that they
are very very different
let's talk about value for a second so
it is $42 you get point seven grams of
eyeshadow in each pan which is not a lot
of shadow I really like to see my
eyeshadow pans with at least a gram of
if not a gram and a half of product
that's more what I feel like is a
reasonable amount of shadow lorac has
really small shadows too you get nine
point eight grams total and that leaves
us a four dollars and twenty-nine cents
per gram people always get on me about
giving too much information as far as
thick places I've messed up I realized
as I was calculating the price program
for this that I was wrong on the price
program for the mana Renaissance that
I've been saying since the beginning of
the mana it's not valid in my life I did
miss calculate on that so the real price
program for both palettes is four
dollars and twenty-nine cents per gram
which is quite expensive per gram of
product I like to see my eyeshadow
palettes under three dollars per gram of
product under two dollars is even better
that's when I consider it to be a really
good deal so this is an expensive
palette compared to a lot of similar
brands like to face even lorac Urban
Decay things like that you're getting
much less product getting a little bit
into ingredients all of these shadows do
contain talc and dimethicone so if you
don't like those ingredients you don't
want to use these another thing is the
matte shades all have the same listed
ingredients with the same may or may not
contain things including carmine carmine
is made from crushed beetles it is a red
pigment I would imagine it is in all of
the Reds here the the peaches things
like that the orange it may not be and
like the yellow but there's no way to
know unless you ask ah Nastasia directly
but if you are anti carmine you do not
want to purchase this people ask me all
the time you know how can it be cruelty
free and have crushed bugs in it it's
because of the definition of what
cruelty free is it means it's not tested
on animals it doesn't mean that it
doesn't contain animal products it does
contain an animal product that's the
crushed up beetles that makes it not
vegan but it doesn't make it not
cruelty-free isn't that weird yeah I
know I'm with you another thing you need
to know is the matte shades do contain
pigments that are not lips safe ferric
ferrocyanide and ultramarines those are
the two the other shades this adorn
electric and cube those do not contain
carmine they do not contain those not
lips safe pigments so if you want to Pat
any of these on your lips those three
you can I don't recommend it for the
others other than that I didn't see
anything that was like red flag worthy
for me that are ingredients that people
tend to complain about when I talk about
ingredients and products they say oh my
goodness this is not good one this is
not a good one for me one thing I
noticed in here that's really weird is
that there is no preservative in here
that I recognized there may be a
preservative but I don't see one that
stands out to me I would imagine all my
ingredients on keys out there or one of
you will know which one of the
ingredients is the preservative but
usually it's phenoxyethanol or some kind
of parabens this doesn't contain either
this does have a six-month shelf life so
please just make sure you're keeping an
eye on this after the six month mark
make sure that you're not you know it's
not becoming discolored doesn't have any
kind of funky smell things like that if
it does you want to throw it away if not
I tend to keep it beyond the expiration
date for powder products but that's just
me another question I get a lot about
these is the ingredient difference
between the products so I'm gonna put on
the screen the ingredients so over here
is the modern renaissance over here is
the subculture and you'll notice that
the subculture has significantly less
ingredients than the modern renaissance
we'll get into a little bit of why I
think they did that and how I feel like
it impacts the product when we get to
the full review but for now I have
swatches for you so let's go ahead and
get into my personal swatches right
about now as I show you the swatches I'm
gonna go ahead and give you my opinions
on all of the shadows how they work and
the best way I have found for them to
work now this is just my personal
opinion and my personal experience if
you have any different experiences I
would love if you would share those in
the comments below so as you can see
there are a ton of different looking
colors in here a lot of shades you don't
typically see one of them the first one
we're going to be talking about is cube
now cube is a sheer white shadow with a
pink shift dawn is more of a nudie beige
we've got kind of an army green and
destiny and then we have this foiled
goldish brown color in adorn it with
cube you want to use a brush like this
one that has
a taper to it where a lot of bristles
are going to be able to pick up on the
product you'll see with Dawn that one
has a really smooth application it's one
of the easiest shadows to work with in
this palette destiny is a little patchy
to apply it first but it can definitely
build you just have to keep playing with
it and adorn is a wonderful foiled
shadow you can definitely build it up to
full opacity overall and this group of 4
cube is my least favorite
I find it very difficult to work with I
find it best layered over top of the
Tarte shaped tape it does not work for
me over Nyx's eye pencil and milk it
doesn't work for me very well just over
a primer it works over top of some
shadows but not all and it's just very
difficult to work with Dawn is super
easy destiny needs just a little bit of
help and adorn is also an easy shadow to
work with now if you're new to my
channel you're new to the wipe test and
this is kind of to show how the shadows
may blend if you blend them and also to
the lasting power to see how much it
stains the skin when you look at the
wipe test results you'll see that Dawn
actually hangs out there really well for
a light shade as this destiny and
adorned cube is completely gone let's
move on to the last three in the top row
again a little patchy on alstory that's
the red in the front
mercury is a really nice smooth shade
but access is a little bit patchy these
are very very pigmented there is a lot
of pigment in these shadows so you do
have to kind of blend and build and
blend and build access I feel like is
the patches of these three for me I had
to practice them play with them to get
especially all-star and access to work
for me mercury was pretty easy you can
see the staining power as we do the wipe
test you could also see how they blend
back and forth these shades do really
well in the wipe test moving on to the
second row we have Roxy electric fudge
and new wave Roxy is another very easy
to use smooth shade
as is New Wave Electric took a lot for
me to get it to work as of now the only
way I can use it is over tarts shape
tape I haven't tried it with other
concealers I'm still playing with it if
I have an update I'll let you know but
you can see with the brush swatch it
does not brush swatch very well at all I
find it best packed and packed and
packed onto the lid or applied with a
fingertip you do not need any effort
with Roxy our new wave fudge needs a
little bit of help building you can see
that the swatch is patchy I find that to
be the same on the eye you just need to
just slowly build it up and it does work
really impressed here with Roxy and New
Wave and how well they hang on fudge I
expected too but those two are a little
bit later I didn't expect them to hang
on that well and electric I absolutely
expect it to fade away it does have
really nice lasting power on the eye
over the shape tape but other than that
it it's it's difficult the last three
shades are untamed edge and rowdy edges
another one of those beautiful smooth
shades as is rowdy but untamed as one of
the patchy was one of the ones that you
want to build up slowly these three I
find to be relatively easy to work with
if you pair them with the right other
shades the most difficult time I've had
with this it's finding the colors that
match together for the looks I want to
create I've paired some of these
together and it looks like a bad 1970s
rug so it's just you have to have that
eye for how the colors will go together
in order to get these to work well super
impressed with edge I can't believe how
well that hangs on with the white test
the other two hanging out there really
well as well now these are all of the
shades all together to kind of give you
an idea of what colors you've got
swatched on my skin tone it's definitely
unique I'll give it that now you have
seen the swatches I want to go ahead and
show you a demo of how I got this look
today I will tell you right now I have
struggled with this palette trying to
get it to work for me it has been like
look after look after look of me looking
at and going oh my gosh I hate this I
actually like this look this is one of
my favorites that I've done so I'm going
to go ahead and show you how I did it
right now there comes the eye look that
I created for today I'm still kind of in
shock with heflin's came out we've got
the Ulta eye primer in nude matte it's a
fabulous eye primer I definitely
recommend it very similar to the Urban
Decay primer potion I was a little
nervous to start this demo I really
didn't want to mess it up first thing
we're gonna do is very important we're
gonna take the brush and we're gonna get
rid of it because it is not good we're
gonna start off with a new wave as that
crease color to kind of start off the
look and just very gently tapping it
into the product and slowly building it
into the crease of the eye I'm winging
it out just a little bit out to the edge
because I want to give my eye a nice
lift again very gently tapping in the
shade fudge and very gently tapping and
patting it into my crease to kind of
create that deep line to make my lid pop
and it does take some work just blending
and building and blending and building
and pushing to get it to be exactly
where I want it to be I am kind of
pointing it outward to just again
accentuate that kind of a winged look on
the edge I have only once or twice ever
used shape tape on my eyes before and I
was really nervous to do this this is a
Wayne Goss eyebrow brush the reason why
I chose that is because it can give me a
lot of deep so it's a very stiff brush
it's got a hard line and I'm just kind
of making like half a moon shape on my
eye but I noticed that it's very strict
so I patted it in with my finger tip to
make it more smooth just making sure I
get it all the way out to the edge of my
eye
okay I'm crossing my fingers that it's
going to work with electric because I
had just watched a tutorial where this
had worked and I hadn't tried it yet and
I was scared and thankfully it did work
it just took a lot of building I
probably dipped my brush to get to full
opacity maybe four or five times into
electric to get it to be as bright as it
ended up being in this look it just
needed a lot of help going into the
shade
Saniya I just wanted that deeper outer
corner and then I'm just blending it in
with a clean brush into a left rec I
wanted to hit up the brow bone a little
bit it was a little too dark so I dipped
into the Anastacio modern renaissance in
the shade tempura and that worked really
well to lighten up the brow bone now
this is just me kind of trying to
perfect the look I was dipping into
fudge and just kind of really deepening
out that out of works I don't feel like
I had gotten it deep in the beginning
and now I'm just blending it out with a
fluffy brush I did want it to be more
intense so I'm building up destiny on
the outer corner and then electric again
to just make sure I've got that blend as
the electric started going over top of
destiny I realized that I really liked
it so I just kind of kept going and hope
for the best and I ended up loving it as
a top or over destiny it just gave it a
really nice shine but you could
definitely still see the deepness of
destiny underneath it now we're gonna go
down to the lower lash line and just
take this pointy brush and go along the
lower half of my eye with fudge and I
wanted to use a different shade so I
just grabbed edge and then brought that
from the inner corner to the center and
now I'm breathing because it's just
really scare this look was gonna come
out a hot mess now this is the look with
liner and lashes and the rest of my face
done I am quite proud of how this look
came out it's definitely one of my
favorite looks I've created recently I
do want to stress that this is like the
fifth or sixth time I didn't I look with
this palette and I can tell you I liked
maybe one or two of the other looks that
I did with this palette before this one
in case you're wondering what's on my
cheeks I have gala for Nia by benefit
and on my lips is the Rimmel stay matte
a liquid lip color in the shade rosette
oh so now all the factual stuff is done
now we're going to go from objective to
subjective and I'm going
be giving you my personal opinion on
this palette and and hopefully try to
guide you as to whether this palette is
going to be good for you or not so the
first thing I've got to kind of critique
anastacio and the choices that the brand
has made with this palette so they
changed the formula there's about half
as many ingredients this is what I
imagine happening I imagine noir vina or
whoever came up with this idea would
imagine or vino goes into the lab and
says I want the most pigmented eyeshadow
possible I want pigmentation give it to
me so the labs like alright I got you
we're gonna do some pigmentation so the
formula goes through and of course
everything is very very different there
is a lot of lot less ingredients so I
would imagine that this palette is
probably pretty expensive to manufacture
and that there aren't a lot of filler
ingredients in it it really is a lot of
pigment
I remember watching Wayne Goss talk
about this I think Stephanie Nicole
talked about this that this is more of a
pressed pigment formula instead of a
eyeshadow typical eyeshadow that you
would find in a pressed form in a
palette I can't speak specifically to
that because I don't have that knowledge
base but I would say that there's
probably more pigment in this than in
the modern renaissance because just
simply because there are less
ingredients by a lot and also because of
the way that they perform so I think the
first mistake they made was calling it
the sister palette to the modern
renaissance I think that was a huge
mistake
this is like second cousin twice removed
like there's there's no they're related
but like barely maybe they like met once
at a family reunion and then they never
spoke again like it's like that kind of
relationship between these two if you're
used to this one then this one may
completely confuse you I know there are
people out there that are able to use
both and don't see that much of a
difference that was not my experience
and I can only speak to my own personal
experience so because the formula is so
different and because they marketed as
being similar to this when people got it
they expected this and they didn't get
it and they were rightly confused by it
so I think that it would have been
better if noir vina had said our most
pigmented eyeshadow
ever you know what I mean like you know
somehow advertised it as being you know
very highly pigmented and a different
unique formula that she's so proud of
you know what I mean that there was a
way to do it to give people a heads up
but still make it sound you know like
something that they would want I think
if people knew what they were getting
when they got this they wouldn't have
had as much trouble with it make her
next misstep was the brush that's in
here the brush that's in here is pretty
stinking bad this this side is really
bad this side is just okay this saw bite
oh my gosh it is pokey it doesn't pick
up product very well from this palette I
found that it picks up the drugstore
eyeshadow palettes products much better
than with this something that's a lot
less pigmented I find this brush
extremely difficult to work with I tried
and tried and try it could not get it to
work this side is a little bit easier to
work with but again it's definitely not
my favorite you saw in the demo I was
using my uLTA Beauty brush which is not
my favorite because it's also kind of
scratchy but I find it easier to use
than this one and that one was rural
religion really cheap just like I had
said with the Kat Von D glamour palette
I wish this has had come with some kind
of look hearts some kind of directions
some kind of something more Vina is
amazing she could have put out a video
tutorial and then put a link you know
into the box some kind of heads up that
told us that this is gonna be a little
different it's gonna need a little bit
of different treatment I have seen
people take brushes and swirl them into
the modern Renaissance to show how
powder they are versus the subculture
yeah these are a little powdery so where
the rock shadows but I can tell you that
these to me are more pigmented and you
have to be more delicate than with the
modern renaissance and with lorac
shadows I mean I love my lorac shadows
and I love that but I feel like this one
is even more soft than that which isn't
necessarily a bad thing it's just
something we need to know the next thing
is the shade selection I gave her credit
for coming up with a unique blend of
colors I think these are very unique as
far as you don't typically see a mustard
yellow or you know this carrot colored
orange or this this brighter peach here
I mean there's there's definitely you
know it's really interesting shades in
here you got an eggplant you've got like
an army
this is so unique and one of the biggest
critiques I've heard from people lately
is oh my gosh if I have to see another
neutral palette oh my gosh if I have to
see another warm palette she did not do
that she came up with something really
unique which i think is awesome because
these are so pigmented there's so much
pigment what I'm finding with these is
when you take certain colors and you put
them together you'll notice that they
turn gray you have to be really careful
which shade you choose so that they
don't turn gray and I think that's where
this formula kind of falls short the
other thing you can do to avoid that
turning gray problem is just to dip into
other palettes that don't have as much
pigment these are like mixing paints
because there is so much pigments they
blend together into one color instead of
keeping their true colors and it's just
difficult for me personally to work with
I've seen people that can get them to
work and not turn gray that has not been
my personal experience another big piece
was that noir vina was saying that that
was their first time using an automatic
pressing machine and they feel like that
was what was it at fault and what I got
from that is they're gonna let this
batch go out and then they're gonna
press the next one's harder personally
this is my opinion and I don't have
evidence of this but this is what I
think and what I believe and I believe
that it's not necessarily a pressing
issue as much as it just is a formula
issue in that not an issue but that just
that it's different and that we just
needed to know it was different before
we got it kind of thing I don't think
there's anything wrong with this formula
I don't think there's anything wrong
with the pressing of it it's just you
have to treat them a little differently
than you treat other shadows there is
also a thing about different batches
that some batches are better than others
my batch is p7g to four I heard the
piece 7gs were not good batches they
were the bad batches I don't think this
is a batch issue I think this is an
issue of not educating well enough and
not testing well enough beforehand you
know I wish that noir vina would take
some of her most trusted influencers
some of the people she really believes
know what they're talking about make
them sign a nondisclosure send them the
product before they even manufacture it
so they can test it and you
feedback on it if she had done that she
would avoided all of this mess so now
the last thing I want to talk to you
about is who do I think this pallet is
good for definitely you've got to like
some darker looks yes you can create
some lighter looks with this but I find
it to be challenging to get lighter
looks out of this I thought I was gonna
get lighter looks because we've got a
couple of lighter shades in here but I
find that the darker shades turn it's so
dark that this is really an evening kind
of look palette for me or you know just
someone that likes darker looks so if
you like a light you know going to work
nice easy you know natural look this
probably isn't going to be the pallet
for you also you've got to have an eye
for how colors go together in order to
work with this I do not have that I I
was not blessed with an artistic brain I
it took me a long time to figure this
out
and that's just me personally if you
don't have that artistic eye you may
either want to watch a lot of tutorials
before you buy it or as you buy you know
as you work with it or just skip it all
together another option is to take some
of these really unique shades and treat
them as single eyeshadows and use them
with other singles you have or other
palettes that's another great way to
work with this the last group of people
I feel like this would be really really
good for people that love just playing
people that love just trying to figure
things out and try different things and
want to spend a lot of time with
appellant if you just want to just dip
in get the palette to work without a
whole lot of thought you really I really
don't think you're gonna want this I
think that's you did you pass on it you
know there's there's lots of things you
can spend $42 on this was probably not
one I would recommend but for me
personally am I happy to have it
absolutely I am and the reason why is
because the shades are just so unique
and I feel like I figured out how to get
it to work and it makes me happy do I
think I'm gonna pull for this all the
time no not at all
maybe in the fall because I feel like
it's got some beautiful fall shades in
it but I probably won't pull for it a
lot but if I ever want these shades I
know where I can go to get them so that
