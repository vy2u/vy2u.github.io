smackdown today we are going to be
comparing the artiste brushes with the
makeup revolution brushes there is quite
a price difference between these brushes
so I wanted to see whether we could get
these same quality and the same effect
from a less expensive brush as you can
for the insanely expensive ones so the
way this video is gonna work is I'm
gonna show you everything that I got and
then after that I'll show you a demo of
how I got this look today using the
artiste brushes and the makeup
revolution brushes and after that I'll
give you my full review of the product
so let's just talk about what I have I
will say that I bought the makeup
revolution brushes on my own myself but
my friend Nancy who is my angel of
makeup bought me three artiste brushes
and I'm so thankful Thank You Nancy for
buying me these artis brushes I think
you guys are gonna get tired of hearing
Nancy I guess Nancy as I said she's my
guardian angel she does it because she
wants to not because I'm making her or
anything I don't anybody think anything
bad about Nancy because she's thinking
amazing and she buys me things
occasionally
so she bought me three artiste brushes
please donate she bought me this one
this is the oval seven she bought me in
the oval three and then she also bought
me the linear one and then when she got
these for me I decided that I wanted to
compare them to makeup revolution so you
could know whether they are they're
worth it or not I would not have
afforded these on my own they're way too
expensive have the makeup revolution
precision contour set and this is the
second one that I've gotten makeup
revolution sent me a second one I will
get into why in just minute and this
this one here compares to the Oval seven
I also got the eye brush set so this is
that and it looks like that and then
this one compares to the Oval three and
then this one compares sort of to the
linear one I believe this matches up
with a different artiste brush but
that's the closest that I could find
from makeup revolution and then you get
this other one as well so one thing you
may notice in the demo is that I use the
artiste brushes on this side of my face
and the makeup revolution was on this
side of my face but because I only have
three artiste brushes only three reduced
brushes because I only have three
sometimes I use to make a revolution on
both sides if I don't have an artiste
brush to match it so let's go ahead and
show you that video right now to buddy
jiminy wrappers and they Phyllis cuz
they filling me I give zero then I got
zero shilling me kissing me I have the
boombox that say Tiffany coffee with the
Queen
I filmed the demo the first thing that
changed was my brows I absolutely hated
the way my brows looked after looking at
the footage so I actually scrapped the
entire rest of the video and I'm
rerecorded it because I had to spoil my
brows they were driving me insane they
looked so bad with both of the products
with both the artis and the makeup
revolution I'd like the makeup
revolution was even was worse than the
t's but still I had to spoil my brows
out I could not do it and that's
probably just operator error and lack of
practice on my part I have done my brows
a couple times with it but I always feel
like I have to spli it out I just I
can't do it I can't do it um so so
that's that the other thing is as I did
at end up adding false lashes because I
felt like with this lipstick I just
wanted to add some false lashes and I
didn't think it made any difference as
far as the artiste review so now that I
told you what changed in the demo if you
go ahead and talk about how I feel about
the brushes let's go ahead and start
with the face brushes so we're gonna
start with this comparison here with the
oval seven versus this one first thing
you'll notice right away is there are
different colors there are also
different weights this one is a bit
heavier than this one
the artis has a rubber grip here where
the makeup revolution doesn't the
feeling of the bristles is pretty much
exactly the same make a revolution did a
fantastic job with the touch of the
brush this one is a bit more rounded and
the artis is a little bit more flat but
I can also say the artis is more dense
than the makeup revolutions so you may
have noticed in the demo that the
artiste side went on more opaque and the
makeup revolution side went on more
transparent that is just the way that it
goes that's why I added a second coat
with the makeup revolution so there is a
difference in application of face
brushes do they both both work
absolutely this one does not apply it as
well as this as far as the opacity of
the product so if you have more
discoloration on your face then you may
want to splurge for the RTS if you want
to try this but this will still do the
job you can also still put concealer on
your face on any discoloration and then
blend that in as well
the way you would normally do with a
beauty blender I do feel like this does
give a beauty blender like finish but
it's a lot faster because you blender
you got a pad and you got a DAB and this
you just go remember and you're done
they're really great for use when you're
kind of rushing in the morning trying to
get ready they're great for that both of
them now as far as the rest of the
contour kit here I also really like
these for applying cheap products for
contouring for highlighting things like
that for blush I really enjoy these I
like them these just as much as I like
regular brushes this one I think I like
just a little bit more than regular
brushes these I like probably about
equal one thing I forgot to mention
about the makeup revolution one
specifically this one because I found
out with this one I was standing in my
foyer I just got in the package and I
was so excited and I read the back of
the box and it said flexes and the
depths of the contour your face and I
was like oh this looks like fun let's
see if I can flex it and I swear I
barely pushed it am i dumb idiot self
broke it here's a picture of what
happens when you break one of these so
don't flex the makeup revolution brushes
I'll do it kind of what I did this is
what I did with the makeup revolution
one and it snapped so definitely be
careful with these they are definitely
cheaper made than these which you would
expect at the price tag now with the eye
brushes we're gonna start with my least
favorite I honestly don't like either of
these for applying eyeshadow I would
much rather use a flat shader brush then
use either of these they're not fun to
use they're not convenient to use they
don't feel good to use I don't like the
way that the application looks in the
end I mean it's fine but I just don't I
don't like them they're not enjoyable
for me and that's just a personal
preference if you love them fantastic I
just don't like them I don't like the
way that they work the Artistes the
white ones also get kind of dirty so if
that bothers you you're not gonna like
it but I just don't enjoy them now going
into the linear brush versus this one
okay I really like the linear brush I
have to tell you I don't like it for
eyeliner very much I
like it's flat and my eye is round and
it just doesn't work I do like it for
applying brow pomade but it definitely
needs a spoolie along with it I do like
it for a lower lashline for eye shadow I
also like it for up in to get some color
like a nice little line a color right in
there like a deeper color it looks
really really nice but I do blend it out
with another shadow brush this one I
don't like at all this one is pretty
terrible and I'll tell you why it's
terrible it's because the bristles are
too long and they're too soft and
they're too bendy and they apply product
like a mess and you saw in the demo how
it applied to my brows I really I mean
I've tried this thing a few times in my
brows and it's just it's ginormous and
it bends too much it's just it's not
controllable it's not easily
controllable and you're a makeup expert
maybe you have more success with a brush
like this I am NOT a makeup expert
therefore I do not have success with it
and I don't like it it's not a good
brush for me at all so this one's a big
no for me this is the last brush that's
in the makeup revolution set this is
like a rounded brush you can use this
for lips I use it for concealer but I
honestly don't like it for concealer
either it applies it but it doesn't
blend it because it gets all streaky if
you try to blend it it just streaks all
over the place that's why I use one of
the other brushes from the contour kit
to blend out my concealer because this
is just it doesn't work well and I just
don't enjoy this at all and for lip
product I don't see it as being any more
efficient than using the doe foot
applicator from a liquid lipstick we're
just applying the lipstick straight to
my lips I just don't see it as being
efficient I mean I got it can kind of
fit here but it's not accurate enough
much ripped off my lipstick it's not
accurate enough to get it exactly where
I want it so it's just not an efficient
brush so for me I do not recommend the
eye brush set from makeup revolution I
don't I don't like any of these brushes
at all but I would recommend the contour
set if you want to try something new but
definitely you want to use these mostly
with cream products you don't really
want to use them with power products
because powder products it just applies
them too dense unless you're baking or
something like that you may really enjoy
these it's just too much for a powder
products but if you really like cream
products you like liquid foundations if
you like cream contours cream blushes it
really is very very nice
now as far as the RT says if you want a
splurge for a brush I really really like
this one a lot it is so easy to use it's
so fast this is definitely my favorite
and one that I would definitely
recommend purchasing like I mentioned
earlier I would not recommend this one I
don't enjoy it and this one is just more
fun I don't think that it's a necessity
in your collection I don't I wouldn't
say that yes you got to go out and get
it but it's fun it's fun to use and if
you're bored with your makeup brushes
and you want to splurge on something
yeah definitely go get it
but you know I don't think it's
necessary at all I mean are any of these
necessary not really but if it was one I
felt like I think you would really enjoy
it would be the oval 7 and the makeup
revolution contour set I think is
definitely worth the price so that is my
review of the Oval brushes that I have
