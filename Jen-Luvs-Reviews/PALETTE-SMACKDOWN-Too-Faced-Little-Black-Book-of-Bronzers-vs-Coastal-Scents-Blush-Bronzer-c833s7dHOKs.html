pellets Smackdown today we're going to
be discussing the Coastal Scents blush
and bronzer palette and the Too Faced a
little black book of bronzers now this
product was sent to me for review but of
course that does not influence my review
at all Coastal Scents loves me just the
way I am with honesty and all so you can
expect an honest review today so we're
gonna be comparing this with the Too
Faced little black book of bronzers this
is currently out of stock pretty much
everywhere I got it at Nordstrom Rack
for half off so it has been gone for a
while but when you open this up you will
see that there are some similarities
between the Coastal Scents brand new
product and the little black book of
bronzers by Too Faced of course there
are definitely shades that are very very
different but I do want to compare them
since there are some similarities and
this one is sold out and this one is not
this one was a $49 this one is 24
ingredient analysis and things like that
we're gonna focus on this product since
this product is no longer available but
just kind of talking about the quality
of the ingredients in here we're also
going to show a demo of how two of these
products applied to my cheeks we're
gonna do some swatches some swatch
comparisons and an ingredient analysis
of course we are going to do that
because we love ingredient analysis we
love all the geeky stuff it is so fun so
let's go ahead and start off with what
this palette is where you can get it all
of that so this blush of bronzer palette
is made by Coastal Scents this product
is available on the Coastal Scents
website it says 1995 it says that it's
on sale for 25% off but it will probably
never go up to full price knowing
Coastal Scents they usually have their
products shown on a discount so this of
course is discounted to 1995 and here
you get 45 grams of product which works
out to 44 cents per gram which is really
really cheap for product really cheap
usually the cheap products for
eyeshadows and things are about $1 per
gram of product a little more $1 dollar
50 so 44 cents per gram is really
inexpensive the little black book of
bronzers in comparison was a $49 and you
get seventeen point five grams of
product which equals out to 2.86
per gram of product in here one thing I
do want to mention is that the products
in here do vary slightly in formula from
the full sizes because of the what I
believe to be the packaging the
packaging here is different than the
full-sized packaging and they have to
switch up the ingredients a little bit
so that they pack properly into this
cardboard packaging so just be aware of
that these are slightly different in
formula than the full-sized versions at
this point we're going to go into
swatches and I will show you all of a
swatch of this and compare it to the
ones that look similar in here
- money can't catch - ooh baby
baby
see these factors I'm going to show you
a demo of two products being applied to
my face on this side I have the Too
Faced palette and on this side I have
the coastal scent and I use these two
shades here today this one in the Too
Faced is the Sun bunny and this one is
the snow bunny so when you're watching
the demo pay attention to see whether
you think they apply the same or
different
because I want me go I don't want to say
pretty you get up
the throw away today right I hope that
you have decided now whether you think
they go on the same or different
personally I feel like they go on quite
differently I feel like the two-faced
one is less pigmented initially but I
think that that's something that's
probably a good thing especially with
cheek products because you want to be
able to build them up however you like
and this one goes on very strong so just
be careful with the pigmentation of this
you definitely want to start with a
light application what I tried to do is
of course I use the same brush and I
also put my my brush in the product the
same amount of time so you could see the
difference in the pigmentation and as
you can see there definitely was more
pigmentation in this product so just be
careful I don't think that it was
something that's difficult to work with
you just have to be aware so you don't
apply too much product now let's talk
about the ingredients and comparing them
so the ingredients in the Coastal Scents
palette they it seems like they have the
same ingredients throughout the entire
palette but with the Too Faced one there
are different ingredients throughout so
what I did was I compared the Coastal
Scents to the different formulas that
are in here to see what percent of of
these ingredients it shares so for
example the milk chocolate Soleil only
has 19% of the same ingredients as is in
this with the chocolate Soleil it is 25%
but why is this upside down goodness
with the chocolate Soleil it is 25% but
they're also less ingredients in the
chocolate Soleil so keep that in mind
because that makes a big difference the
beach bunny there's only 9 ingredients
along with the Sun bunny only 9
ingredients so 44% are shared with this
and then with the endless summer the
endless summer actually has a lot of
ingredients and they share 29% of the
same ingredients between beach bunny and
Sun bunny let me show it don't show you
what those look like
this is beach bunny and this is Sun
bunny they're actually the exact same
formula except for the pigments that are
used they
are some differences in the pigments but
other than that they're the exact same
formula so are these formula dupes
absolutely not they're not formula dupes
at all they're not even close so one
thing that I thought was really
interesting when we're talking about
ingredients is that this one does
include tell where this one does not so
if you're sensitive to tell you
definitely do not want to buy the Too
Faced you want to buy the Coastal Scents
instead some people are very sensitive
to tell some people just don't want to
help in their products at all so
definitely go with this the other thing
is is neither of them have parabens so
you're good without parabens a lot of
people accuse Coastal Scents of using
parabens in this product there are no
parabens so now let's get down to the
down-and-dirty of whether this product
has any bad ingredients meat bad meaning
the Environmental Working Group ewg org
whether they have identified any of the
ingredients in here as being potentially
harmful to you so let's talk about the
first one with is which is esse hexyl
palmitate this does have an irritant
alert on it even though it's rated a1 on
Environmental Working Group which means
that it isn't harmful it is an organic
replacement to silicone it's used as a
skin conditioning ingredient there is
strong evidence that it's a human skin
irritant but that was when there was 40
to 50 percent of the ingredient being at
the hexyl palmitate so this is
definitely not going to have 40 to 50
percent in it so chances are it's not
going to bother you in this but if you
do have a really sensitive skin that may
be an ingredient that bothers you the
next one is called tocopherol acetate
and that is a synthetic vitamin e it's
listed as a three for environmental
working group as far as its level of
danger which is can still considered a
low danger it is listed as a skin toxin
or allergen something that you could be
sensitive to it is also expected to be
an environmental toxin and be persistent
or bio accumulative meaning that it
builds up in your system so but they
don't know how much you need to have in
your system in order for it to be
harmful to you but if that bothers you
you definitely want to stay away from
this product but just know that that is
a very common ingredient in beauty
products so you might want to go through
your stash if that would bother you know
but but yeah so that is in this one and
then the last one is vino ops the
ethanol that's listed as a four and it
is a preservative it's restricted in
cosmetics in Japan and also it's
classified as an irritant in the
European Union it's also classified as
toxic or harmful for products around the
mouth or the lips and that's also by the
European Union because this is a cheek
product you wouldn't have to worry about
that but just know this is something you
probably shouldn't be putting on your
lips it's also one of those products
where the allowed workplace exposure is
limited so people that work with it can
only handle it so much in its pure
concentration they have to be careful
with how much they're handling it so
just be aware of that as well in this
but overall nothing that stands out as
being super super like crazy horrible
bad but definitely some things if you
have sensitive skin this may be a
product that irritates you now as far as
my personal review of this product I
really really like this and that is
completely honest I have definitely
given some negative reviews to Coastal
Scents products in the past but this is
one that I just can't give a negative
review lasting power on these products
is fantastic the application is
fantastic again you just have to make
sure that you're using a fluffier brush
you don't want to use a really dense
brush and you want to just tap your
brush into the product in order to get
the right amount on your cheeks but it's
definitely not the most pigmented cheek
products that I've ever used the ones
that they have in the single pans are
super pigmented they're very difficult
to work with I don't find these
difficult to work with and I love the
shade range that they've included in
here I love that they've included the
four blushes and that they are all ones
that are very different from each other
I feel like this could be used with
people of any skin tone except for maybe
the bronzer maybe a little bit light for
some people but overall I mean I feel
like they've done an excellent job
putting these shades together the
highlight shades are really really fun
to play with they work great and I've
really been enjoying this palette a lot
it's a definite recommend I have nothing
negative to say about it except for
maybe some of the little ingredient
concerns if you have sensitive skin but
other than that I have no complaints
it's fantastic especially for $20 this
thing's gonna last you forever
it is a highly highly recommend so the
