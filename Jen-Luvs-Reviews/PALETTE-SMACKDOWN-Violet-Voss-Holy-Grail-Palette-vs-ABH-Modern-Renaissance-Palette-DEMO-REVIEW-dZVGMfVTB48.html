smackdown today we're going to be
discussing the Anasazi Beverly Hills
mana Renaissance palette and the violet
Voss holy grail palette I'm not sure
exactly when this came out but as soon
as it did everyone was dying over it
people that were sent it for review
people that had done tutorials on it and
then everybody that bought this
afterwards seemed to also rave about it
as you can see it's very warm toned very
fall you've got lots of berries and
oranges and there's some champagnes and
things in here you've never heard of
violet Voss they're an indie brand I got
this actually at believe I'm at yes I
got this at IMATS in New York City and
it has a lot of the same kinds of ideas
we've got a lot of berries a lot of warm
tones champagnes things like that when
you put them next to each other you can
see lots of similarities are they the
same no but they're very similar so I
figured hey let's go ahead and look and
see the similarities and differences
between these palettes so let me tell
you how this is going to work I'm going
to talk about packaging comparisons
availability comparisons and then we're
going to go into a little demo I
actually have the Anastacio palette on
one side and the Holy Grail palette on
the other side of my face and you will
be able to well my eyes technically and
you'll be able to see me applying both
of them to really see how the shades
compare and then after I show you the
little demo I'm going to go into all the
geeky nerdy stuff like value ingredients
the fact that one is made in China and
one is not cruelty free options things
like that let's talk about availability
and packaging first as of now everywhere
that I tried to find this palette online
it was sold out but I know that it is
available still in a lot of stores
Sephora's old us things like that
currently the Violette Voss Holy Grail
palette is sold out but it's supposed to
be coming back in stock in mid-october
which is not too far away so I figured
you know since you can still get this
and you will be able to get this again
very very soon I thought it would be a
good comparison as far as the packaging
goes the packaging of course is quite
different
the modern renaissance palette has
a very soft velvet cover and this does
get dirty it has been getting dirty for
me and I would imagine it would continue
to get dirty as I used it it is a hard
cardboard packaging underneath you do
get a mirror
with it you get 14 shades in here they
are on small square pans and you also
get a brush with this this is the brush
that it comes with it comes with a flat
side and a fluffy side for the whole
Holy Grail palette as you can see the
pans are quite a bit larger does not
come with a brush but does have a mirror
on that side the only thing about a
mirror in both of these palettes is it
doesn't really stand up so unless you
have something to prop it on its the the
mirror isn't really going to stay up so
just kind of keep that in mind the
mirror may not be useful unless you know
you have something else to help it out
to stay up this is also a cardboard
packaging but of course you don't get
the velvet on the outside but as you can
see it does have lots of smudge prints
on there so if that bothers you you may
not want to get this one either because
both of them didn't get dirty very very
quickly and this one you get 20 shadows
so you get quite a bit more as far as
shades and also the pan sizes are larger
so now that we talked a little bit about
availability and packaging let's go into
the little demo so you can see how these
shadows apply to the eyes
one thing that I thought was really
interesting about applying one palette
to one eye and the other palette to the
other eye is that the shades definitely
were not dupes that I used they were
kind of the closest I could get to
duping each other and trying to get them
to be the same but once I put on the
rest of my makeup it was very difficult
and still is very difficult to tell the
difference is between the shadows so it
just kind of goes to show that you can
get similar looks with these palettes
even though the shades are not identical
you can see some of them were closer
than others as far as the shade and
again the violet Voss has more options
as far as different shadows than the
modern Renaissance I think when
sometimes when people try to dupe
appellant you know they're so concerned
about getting the exact same shade when
really on the face you're not going to
be able to tell the difference and I
think in the end it's your end look that
I think is going to make the biggest
difference not whether you're being so
technical as far as it being the exact
same tone now let's talk a little bit
about product value so I looked up the
price per gram so when you're looking at
the violet Voss holy grail palette we're
looking at 36 grams of product
altogether which equals out to a dollar
17 per gram and then the honest Asya
palette is done seven point nine four
grams so almost eight grams which ends
up being $5.25 per gram which is about
four and a half times more product you
get in the violet Voss Holy Grail than
the modern renaissance palette which I
thought was kind of crazy so value wise
if you're talking dollars per gram the
volleyballs Holy Grail is definitely a
better value let's get really geeky here
and start talking about some of the
ingredients
these pallets now the number one
ingredient in the violet Vols palette is
talc followed by mica now the number one
ingredient in the Anastasi of Beverly
Hills palette is mica followed by
dimethicone so you've got the pigment
and then you've got a silicone and then
you've got two pigments here some people
are very sensitive to talc so if you are
sensitive to talk you are not going to
want to purchase this because that is
the number one ingredient here
one thing also is that it seems like
they have here in the ingredients for
the holy grail palette I had to get it
off the internet because I don't have
the box anymore but it seems like the
shadows have similar ingredients there's
a lot of may or may not include
clarifiers for different things as far
as like the coloring and some of the
ingredients they don't list them quite
as nicely as
anastacio does anastacio actually has 11
different formulas formula combinations
within this palette within the 14 shades
kind of crazy right but of the top 10
ingredients meaning the ingredients that
are in the highest concentration in the
shadows 7 of the 10 ingredients are
included in all eleven formulas so
essentially in the base of the product
the majority of the product you're
talking about it's the same ingredients
when they mix them up in the different
formulas of the different shadows
sometimes they're in different orders
suggesting different concentrations of
different ingredients but overall the
same ingredients but in different orders
for the different formulas of these
shadows where these seem to be at least
according to the way they've listed it
pretty much the same kind of ingredient
throughout the palette other ingredients
that you may be sensitive to in here
include ethyl hexyl palmitate which is
an organic replacement to silicone I'm
reading off my notes here it can be
irritating to sensitive skin and also it
does have parabens where this does not
have parabens so if you're sensitive to
parabens or you are anti paraben you
would want to go for this one you would
not want to purchase this one another
thing people were talking about that I
want to mention in this video is people
were saying that the formula of the
modern renaissance palette seemed to be
so different from previous honest Asya
palettes in the past now one thing
Anastacio does is when they release a
palette like this they release a stir
an amount and then it's gone they don't
keep like Urban Decay's naked palettes
that have been around forever they don't
keep the same palette and allow it to be
purchased for long a long period of time
so I went online and I looked for the
ingredients of some of their past
palettes and compared it to the modern
renaissance now I did find that the
majority of the ingredients in their
past palettes were the same as in the
mana Renaissance palette except for
really the two ingredients were very
very different one of them is called
Laurel lysine that is a conditioning
agent made from coconut oil was in their
previous palettes but not in this one
another one that they have gotten rid of
is an ingredient called PTFE which is
actually Teflon it's another name for
Teflon the stuff that you use for
non-stick pans that people have had
negative things to say about Teflon
careful with the Teflon in your pans but
unless you're heating up your eyeshadow
to 350 degrees they say according to the
research that I've read that it should
not affect shouldn't be a carcinogen in
eyeshadow so if you have the the
self-made palette or the amrezy palette
those were the two I was able to find
ingredients for it is in those palettes
but it shouldn't be a big problem like
they've said it's a problem in Teflon on
on non-stick pans but it is kind of
strange to put Teflon and eyeshadows I
thought that was kind of interesting but
again the modern renaissance palette
does not include that ingredient so that
may be a big difference in the formula
the omission of those two ingredients
they've also moved around the
ingredients as far as the amount of the
product I'll list them both here as far
as I'll put the amrezy palette and this
one next to each other so you can see
how they've changed up the ingredients
for this palette specifically and I'm
just going to take one of the formulas
of eyeshadow in here and kind of show
you the difference I can't show you I'm
not going to show you all eleven
different combinations but just so you
can get an idea of how they changed up
this eyeshadow formula versus older
honest Asya palettes now a big rub that
people say about the violet Voss holy
grail palette and viola Voss products in
general is that they are made in China I
was unable because I throw away my box I
was unable to put my eyes on the fact
it was made in China I believe people
when they have said this but I want to
let you know that I was personally
unable to find that information but that
doesn't mean that it's not true it's not
on the violet Voss website it's not on
the packaging at least that I could find
it just says on the back that it's
distributed from Oceanside California
but it does not say anything about made
in China on here but I'm going to for
the purposes of this video just assume
that it is made in China this one is
made in the United States and also comes
out of California okay so this is the
thing about a lot of people say that
products that are made in China cannot
be cruelty free and for the research
that I did that is not true
if you don't know China requires
companies to test on animals in order to
sell products in China but you can
manufacture products in China and not
sell them and not test on animals as
long as you don't sell them in that
country it seems like that is what's
happening with the violet Voss palette
that they are manufacturing it in China
but they are not selling it in China
therefore Violette Voss claims that it
is cruelty free honest Asya also claims
to me cruelty free made in the United
States so in the end what does this all
mean I'm not going to give you all the
answers in this video I trust that you
are an intelligent consumer and you'll
be able to put the information that I'm
giving you together in order to decide
whether this product is right for you it
seems the ingredients in the violet Voss
palette can irritate some people the
talc and the parabens things like that
that are here that are not here this is
made in China this is made in the United
States if you only buy products made in
the United States or if you prefer to
buy products made in the United States
you're going to go with this one if you
want a better value you're going to go
with this one this has four and a half
times more product than this one and as
far as application goes my personal
opinion I feel like they apply pretty
much the same I feel like if I had to
choose which one applies better I would
choose the honest Asya just because I
feel like the shadows blend better
together with this product you can get a
shadow onto your eye and try to blend it
with another color and because it's so
pigmented the sting
you can kind of interfere with how the
shadows blend together making it a
little bit more difficult to work with
this one has 14 shades this one has 20
you know so I mean there's lots of
different factors that may push it one
way or the other for you personally and
and for me I'm happy to have them both I
enjoy both of them I've seen some really
negative reviews on the violet Voss Holy
Grail palette people that really don't
like it say the shadows don't last I
have not had that experience from me
they both last the same I have worn
these on both eyes a couple of times
where I have one on one side one on the
other side they fade out the same for me
and I would imagine that with this look
it would be no different I don't feel
like there's a difference in where time
here those are kind of the facts do with
them what you will and I want to thank
