same look with something that is very
very very similar so some of them are
exact dupes some of them are just very
very similar so oh and the good part is
all of the dupes are drugstore which
makes it that much more amazing hello my
friends welcome to my review and doopy
goodness of the Pat McGrath lip kits
these have been all the rage everywhere
everybody's talking about these things
Pat McGrath is a legend and makeup and
I'm so excited to be able to dupe them
for you these kits are $60 apiece in
each kit you get two lipsticks a lip
gloss a gold pigment and a glitter a
little glitter pot I have lots of things
to share with you but before I give you
information on the dupes and the
ingredients and all of that good stuff
I'm gonna show you the dupes because
showing is sometimes better than just
telling you about it so what I'm gonna
do is I am going to show you the Pat
McGrath on one side of my lip and the
dupe on the other side of the lip and
then I'm going to take them put them
together and make an ombre effect with
them showing you how to do it with the
Pat McGrath lip kit and how to do it
with the dupe so you can see whether
they perform the same in that artsy kind
of way that Pat and Grethe is known for
some of them are exactly some of them
are just closed like I mentioned in my
Anastasia Beverly Hills violet Voss
palette comparison I will link that the
little eye over there and then also in
the description when you're trying to
dupe something it's not necessarily
honestly important to make it exactly
the same shade because you can create
pretty much the exact same look with
something that is very very very similar
so some of them are exact dupes some of
them are just very very similar so oh
and the good part is all of the dupes
are drugstore which makes it that much
more amazing I won't be using the
glitter or the gloss today because well
I'll tell you I'll explain all of that
later but before I get into all of that
that I'm really excited about let's go
ahead and show you the doobie goodness
yes you've gone too far
cuz you know it don't matter anyway you
can rely on the old man's money you can
rely on the old man's money it's a bitch

on the old man's money you're a rich
girl a rich girl you're a rich girl yeah
c-money but it won't get you too far so
now you have seen the dupes you have
seen that I have duped them or at least
close to dupe them with the velvet matte
lipsticks by NYX and that was the big
one that I was able to find the same if
not similar shades I was also able to
find similar definitely not the same
with the Revlon ultra matte lip colors
now let's get into all the geeky stuff
because you guys know I love this stuff
thank you so much to stephanie nicole by
the way for starting off all of this
geeky stuff i seriously took my
inspiration for looking up ingredients
and everything from her so Thank You
Stephanie for being an inspiration and
encouraging me to totally geek out over
the ingredients of makeup so let's talk
about the ingredients of the lipsticks I
usually review eyeshadow that's kind of
my thing so when I went to go look at
the ingredients of lipstick and lip
glosses I didn't realize how many
ingredients can possibly be in lipstick
and lip glosses so what I learned about
these Pat McGrath lip use is that there
at least at Ulta I could not find any
dupe formulas the other thing I learned
is that the ingredients in these are all
listed as a 1 by Environmental Working
Group which is a group that they look
into ingredients and tell whether they
are hazardous or not it's very easy to
look up ingredients on their website so
I looked up the ingredients they're all
listed as one which means none of them
have any evidence that they are harmful
to you in any way which is fantastic
the closest formula dupe that I could
find only had three of the same
ingredients and it's the Urban Decay
vice lipstick metallized - believe it or
not they had the same first ingredient
and then the third ingredient in the
urban decay and then the ninth ingredie
and the urban decay are also included in
the Pat McGrath lippies but that is in
no way close to being a dupe but that's
the closest I could find I mean really
and truly I look through so many
lipstick formulas could not find one
well let me just talk about the
packaging first I don't like that
they're just straight black there's no
way to tell what lipstick is in here
unless you squint your eyes if you have
any issues reading small print then this
is not going to be friendly for you I
know a lot of my friends that are
starting to go like trying to see little
tiny brands if
you're not gonna like this packaging
really tiny print this one says flesh
two on the outside just very difficult
to read you have to open up the each one
to find out which one you have in your
hand which I don't particularly like I
wish that they had just colored this cap
down at the bottom I think that would
have really made a huge difference also
with these the nude ones the flesh kit
was actually not bad as far as the wear
of it it didn't break down really badly
it was it was relatively nice to wear
not particularly hydrating but not
dehydrating either just kind of went on
sat there did what it was supposed to do
and then slowly faded away gracefully I
really liked the flesh kit for that now
the other one the venom kit okay the
venom one I wore for filming one day for
what's up in makeup and I guess it was
about six hours after I put it on I what
I had to go on insta snap or incest
stories wherever you want to call them
and I had to show how terrible my lips
looked it was so bad it was flaking off
and wearing down horribly it was nasty
like I think it tries to stain but then
it doesn't do a good job of it so it
ends up clumping and flaking off it was
horrible it was absolutely horrible so
deadly don't recommend the red one which
is called venom that one wore down
really bad unless you're really good at
keeping up with your lip product and
good on you but on that for me
personally now for size of these you
really don't get a lot of product in
here if you guys remember back I guess
it was like end of last year there was a
collaboration between Tati and Birchbox
and they made these like little
lipsticks and little eyeshadow things
that were supposed to be like one season
looked a little bit like this this
little tiny thing and they were
relatively inexpensive because they were
less amount of product they weren't
supposed to last forever so this little
thing has point zero two ounces of
lipstick in it the Pat McGrath lip kits
have point zero five ounces of lipstick
in them so about twice as much as
talkies and that does until you look at
the
and the Knicks has 0.14 so you're
looking at here with being point five so
about three times a little less than
three times the product in a Knicks
lipstick as you get in a Pat McGrath
lipstick twenty four dollars on its own
twenty four dollars
hmm as you can see I am NOT super
impressed by the lip products I do not
think that they are worth the price tag
the nude ones are not bad but they're
very overpriced but when we get to the
gloss things get kind of interesting now
this looks like just a regular clear
gloss and it performs like a regular
clear gloss it is a little bit thick
it's very slick on the lips it feels
very sticky on the hand like if you
swatch on your hand but on the lips it's
actually not sticky at all so I thought
this would be super easy to do and it
wasn't I did find that there's three
ingredients in lip gloss that are very
common they're not in all lip glosses
but they're in this and they are in a
few others so if you want to try a lip
gloss formula that's similar to these I
actually looked at the Mac website they
have these first two ingredients are the
same and then later on they have another
ingredient the Catrice infinite shine
lip gloss has the same first two
ingredients the essence XXXL shine lip
gloss has the same first two ingredients
along with the Stila lip glaze and the
laura geller color lustre lip gloss so
if you've tried any of those formulas
they have the same base as this but the
rest of the ingredients are very very
different except for one did I find
anything magical or special about this
gloss not really I do how do think that
it helped keep this pigment on a little
bit better I felt like it really made it
stick so that's a positive thing but
other than that I didn't find anything
special about the gloss now the pigment
okay I've heard a lot of people kind of
saying talking trash about the pigment
and I could see why alright first let me
tell you that the thing is gorgeous it
is this gorgeous pure gold pigment it is
beautiful
I do not own anything in my collection
that looks like this it is gorgeous I
couldn't do it with anything Ulta I
couldn't do it with anything in
collection I have Gold's like this but
they're not such a fine powder they're
more of a glitter so I just I couldn't
do it I couldn't do it but does it mean
a dupe doesn't exist no it does not mean
that but I do want to say this is very
very interesting the ingredient the way
that's listed it says the only
ingredient is may contain + / - copper
powder CI 7 7400 that's the only
ingredient so if it may contain that
then what else could it contain it's
like that's all that could possibly be
in here it's the only thing that's
listed it just makes no sense to me why
they would say may contain when it
obviously has to contain it because
there's no other options so I think
that's really strange but I will tell
you I do really like the pigment I do
like it it is very finely milled it is
very gorgeous
I would and there's anything I would say
I would really really want from this kit
it's this this right here this I think
is super fat but there's gotta be a way
to find this somewhere else some indie
company has to have something exactly
like this okay moving on to the glitter
so when you get the glitters the red one
comes with a red glitter and the nude
one comes with a light peach glitter I
tried to dupe them I didn't do very well
but I got the NYX glitters this one is
in the shade red even though it's more
of a deep pink and then this one is in a
rose I find them very very difficult to
work with I have no idea how in the
world in the pictures from these lip
kits that they got that pigment to stick
on the lipgloss that opaque and like I
don't even know how like I I could not
get it on to stay on my finger like when
I stick my finger in it I'm gonna tap a
bunch out like I do with all pigments
that I get and glitters I can get any to
come out it's like stuck in there so I'm
gonna have to take off the sifter oh I'm
scared I'm scared I just want to show
you what this glitter is compared to the
NYX one so this one right here is the
Pat McGrath this is the next obviously
it is not a
OOP the shades are completely different
but you can see that the glitter is
exactly the same shape exactly the same
size it ends up being the exact same
opacity I do have trouble packing it on
to my lips it's difficult to work with
I just I I don't know I don't it's just
not my thing I don't like it I have
trouble getting the glitter out of the
pot I had to actually take the sifter
off because it was jammed in there so
tight and the glitter just wasn't coming
out so the only way I could get it out
was by taking the sifter out and it's
just a pain it's just a pain it's not
enjoyable and I definitely I'm not a fan
and the same thing happened with the one
from the new kit it's not any difference
now this one is only if you're extremely
aware of what ingredients are in your
makeup products because if you're I'm
talking about the very last ingredient
in the glitter and it's the same last
ingredient that's in the NYX it is
aluminum aluminum powder is very very
very harmful especially if inhaled if
you remember buddy Ebsen he was a guy
that was on Beverly Hillbillies he
played Jake Clampett he was supposed to
be in the Wizard of Oz is the Tin Man
and they put this aluminum makeup on him
and he ended up getting respiratory
problems and having to leave the cast
and all of that so aluminum has been
known for a very long time to be
extremely dangerous in cosmetics now it
is the very last ingredient in these but
if you go to the Environmental Working
Group I'm just gonna read off to you
some of the things that it says it says
known human nervous system toxins it
says that it's a violation of government
restrictions it's restricted in
cosmetics use depending on what the
concentration is you can only use so
much and it says specifically for
products on the lips that that is the
most dangerous place to use aluminum
it's a lip kit it's a suspected
nanoscale ingredients with potential to
absorb into the skin but I really think
that that's more for more finely milled
aluminum and also in a higher
concentration but still if you're one of
those people that's very conscious of
what goes into your products and onto
your lips you may want to skip the
glitter you may want to skip this
glitter to this glitter is actually
worse this one also contains something
called CI
77266 it's almost pure carbon is what
the ingredient is and it says that it's
restricted in cosmetics use it's a color
additive that's not approved by the FDA
for cosmetics around the eyes and it's a
lot of people use this kind of glitter
for their eyes and your the FDA says
don't do that and I listened to the FDA
because the FDA is not very particular
about what they restrict so if they're
restricting something there's got to be
a really darn good reason for doing it
there's a lot of things they just let
slip by so overall final thoughts on
these products I personally think $60 is
insanely overpriced for what you get I
feel like the nude lipsticks are pretty
good the red lipsticks and not so good I
feel like the the pigment is fantastic I
really like it but definitely probably
you can find it somewhere else the lip
gloss is very ordinary you can
definitely find something even though
it's not the exact formula you can find
something very similar it's a clear
gloss and then the glitters are
difficult to work with I did not enjoy
personally if it's your thing you may
like them but for me it was too no so
for me these Pat McGrath lip kits are
kind of all wha-wha-wha and I don't
recommend them unfortunately I wanted to
recommend them but I can't so I won't so
