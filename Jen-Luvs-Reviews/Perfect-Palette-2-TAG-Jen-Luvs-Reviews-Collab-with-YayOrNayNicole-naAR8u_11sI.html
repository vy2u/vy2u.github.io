but it's the truth I'm not gonna lie
hello my friends welcome to the perfect
palette tag or perfect palette to tag I
did do the original perfect palette tag
I will leave that link down below but
this is actually in collaboration with
my friend Nicole over yea or nay Nicole
we are celebrating her one-year
anniversary as a reporter for what's up
and makeup she is our sales and deals
reporters so whenever you hear near the
end of the show all those sales and
deals Nicole is the one that's gathered
those for you nicole has a fantastic
youtube channel she's so so informative
knows exactly what she's talking about
when it comes to makeup she's absolutely
stinking gorgeous I mean look at her
look at her she's gorgeous and she's so
good with makeup so good with makeup and
she knows so much and she most
importantly is one of the sweetest
people I've ever had the pleasure to
meet on youtube I mean just the nicest
kindest person so if you are not
familiar with Nicole's channel i will
link it there i will also link it down
below for you to check out she's also
doing the perfect toilet to tag so
definitely check out her video as well
so now this tag has been out for a
little while it's been out I guess it's
been out since early spring so we run a
little late to the game on this one but
I did have a lot of requests to do this
when this tag was super popular so when
nicole says she want to do with me I was
like yes definitely so let's go ahead
into the first question which is
eyeliner brush or nothing included
personally unless it's a liquid eyeliner
included I really don't want anything
like if Kat Von D put in a tattoo liner
and trooper in her eye shadow palette I
would not complain but a regular pencil
liner hmm brush I mean they're okay I
think it just depends on how big of a
makeup junkie you are and how many
brushes and eyeliners you've already own
because I do own a lot I don't need any
more I'd rather have extra shadow space
that's just me personally number to name
a palette you've hit pan on this one's
really sad sad question and I was a
little sad to even see this on here I've
never hit pan on a pallet never never
because I'm constantly buying new
pallets and trying new ballots she
never done hit pan on anything this is
people ask must have dragged to a
project pan it's like no you don't
understand it would take me years isn't
it and on anything like I just I just
not it's not the way I operate I like to
try lots of different things and then I
pass along things that I am you know not
using anymore to people who want them
like I use it i'm here to review things
for you not to hit pan that's just kind
of where I'm at I don't know what that
makes me but i I just I like to review
products and I like to try lots of
different things so I never hit pan ever
oh I feel I sound ridiculous right now
but it's the truth I'm not gonna lie
alright favorite Naked palette so this
is really they mean like a neutral
palette so my favorite neutral palette
is the Too Faced chocolate bar palette I
love this thing I love this ballot it is
so fab and lately ever especially ever
since i did my my review of all of the
two-faced smelly pallets i'm hearing
more people and more mixed reviews of
this i feel like this is it's pretty
positive reviews on the original
chocolate bar palette if you don't know
anything about the chocolate bar palette
if you're curious about more about these
two faced palettes i will link my video
down below that talks about all of the
all the smelly pallets i review i think
four or five of these two face palettes
but this one's my favorite I love the
color of ride in it I love the color
payoff on the shadows overall they make
me super super super happy I'm not going
to go into too much because you know I
have a full review but just know that
this palette makes me happy in my heart
I've said this before and I will say it
again if I were to be made into an
eyeshadow palette I would want to be
made into this this this would be me in
an eyeshadow palette it is me it smells
like chocolate and it's it does what
it's supposed to do which is what I hope
to do in life and to what I'm supposed
to do does that even make sense I don't
think that makes any sense hey favorite
holiday or limited edition palette
definitely going to go with the kat von
d maybe two loca palette oh my gosh how
i love this thing and let me tell you
why i love this ok with this palette the
reason why i love this palette is
because of the inner wheel the inner
wheel makes everything possible it
really helps the looks all fall together
and the thing is is this how it looks
really scary it's got lots of scary
colors but I'm telling you I wore this
yellow to work okay you can make colors
work and make them wearable I've worn a
lot of these colors to work these bright
colors because what you can do is you
can tone them down with some of these
lighter shades that are in here you use
these as your transition shades and then
you can tone them down to a point where
they're wearable and I've so much fun
with this palette I really love it a lot
I use it all the time I haven't been
using it quite as much lately because
i've been playing with my alison
wonderland palette more but i know i
will be going back to using this very
very soon because a little bit number
five is another fail question for me it
says name a palette you would repurchase
or wish you had a back of a back above
it was no longer available besides maybe
the chocolate bar I honestly feel like
most eyeshadows at this point are due
pible to an extent where you can get a
very similar look with another eyeshadow
palette and honestly I don't I used to
say my naked 2 was one that I would
repurchase desert island all of that but
I don't feel that way anymore because I
feel like you know with with all of the
companies out there that are making
eyeshadow palettes and how often people
are coming out with new palettes and
brands are come out with new pals I mean
it's like it's never-ending so I don't
feel like any product is irreplaceable
anymore you know just because it's just
the market is so saturated with new
products especially having what's up and
make up my makeup news show it's like I
hear about all these eyeshadow palettes
that come out all the time and it's like
how many eyeshadow palettes do we really
need in life like you know so I don't
know I feel like I have no I shadow
palettes at this point where I feel like
I just could not live without them
number six is named a shade you wish
were sold individually and there is one
and it is the shade creme brulee that is
in the chocolate bar palette this shade
is gorgeous it is a gold with like a
pink undertone like a pink like shift to
it oh my gosh I've never seen a shade
like this it is so so gorgeous number
seven is to pick a question from the
original perfect palette tag
and my one that I'm going to be picking
is best color names and this is by far
my favorite palette for color names this
is the bombs balm Jovi palette this is
the rockstar face palette oh my gosh the
names in here look it says rock and roll
in here and it just brings me back to my
childhood in the 80s and 90s so we have
Metallica Iron Maiden Led Zeppelin and
Alice copper and then in the middle as a
bunch of classical music so over here is
the heavy metals these are the classical
so you have Adagio allegro moderato I
don't know if I sell it right and presto
and then over here is the alternative
rock and roll section so you have blank
1982 the stroke REM and third eye
blinded now it gets better my favorite
ones are down here so this is disco
disco solid gold which is AG older
version of mary lou manizer and then pop
hop don't you want me which is a really
nice blush down here milli and vanilli
yes and the best part about milli and
vanilli is there the lip sync playback
duo if you don't know Milli Vanilli
google it google it another thing i
really like is it says top for smoke and
hot looks like a it's like a top for how
we used to have the top 40 so you've got
different i shadow combinations down
here on the flap which i think is pretty
genius so the bomb is really good at
being creative so definitely wins for
the most creative names and the last one
is named the palette you would recommend
to a friend and that would definitely be
the wet and wild comfort zone palette I
feel like this palette is one that
everybody should own regardless of skin
color regardless of price point I mean
like this is a five dollar palette I
believe and it is so stinking awesome
and I really believe that anybody can
use this palette and get great looks out
of it the other thing is stamped inside
is what you can use it for I mean of
course you don't have to stick to that
but it says brow bone eyelid crease into
finer and you can go down there and
anybody can use this palette I'm really
and truly I don't know anybody that
doesn't love wet and wild comfort zone
if you don't love wet wild comfort zone
I would love to hear about it why in the
world you don't like this because I
can't imagine any reason why they
wouldn't like this it's thinking amazing
and the quality is amazing the
price is amazing there's nothing wrong
with this palette nothing lasting power
is amazing blend ability everything and
it's five dollars five dollars when
while could do this all the time they
would always have my money unfortunately
they don't but yes on wet and wild
comforts them so that is my perfect
palette to tag I hope you enjoyed this
