the K where we test out Korean beauty
products to decide whether worth your
hard earned money today we're going to
be talking about the skin food pineapple
peeling gel as well as it's supposed to
peel my face off so we'll see whether it
kills the face off or not this product
was given to me by my friend Lynn so
thank you Lynn for giving this to me I
really appreciate it
my relationship with skin food products
has been kind of hit and miss I tend to
like the product but I find some strange
things happening with the ingredients
sometimes I will list my other what the
K videos down below including some other
skin food products but before we get
into ingredients and all of that I will
tell you how much this cost so you can
get this for $12 at the skin food
website and also at Ulta but you can
also get this on Amazon for eight eight
dollars and seventeen cents if you have
Amazon Prime it's free shipping I might
even be free shipping for everybody's
you can check that out for yourself with
your own Amazon account the description
for this says that this is a deep
peeling gel it contains cellulose
particles in AHEA found in apples it
effectively exfoliates dry skin and
eliminates sebum in pores pineapple aloe
and purslane extracts cultivate skin
that is clear and blemish free now my
skin type is normal I do have a little
friend that popped up right here but
he's going away but overall as you have
a relatively blemish free skin so this
may work better for someone with acne
prone skin
there's also reasonably this may work
well for people with dry skin but me
with normal skin we're just going to
test it for the skin that I got because
I'll have a choice that's good that so
now talking about ingredients Korean
skincare they talked a lot about their
ingredients and they kind of hyped them
up now just so you know if you look on
the Ulta website the ingredients are
listed differently than the skin 2
website I did wait to film this so that
I could hear back from skin-food and
they did confirm that the Ulta website
does not have the correct ingredients
I believe those might be the ingredients
for the strawberry scrub I did not that
long ago because it says it has
strawberry seed in it which this clearly
does not so we're going to go off the
skin food ingredient list when we look
there we have some texture ingredients
and then the fourth ingredient is
denatured alcohol which is known to dry
the skin so if you have a sensitivity to
ending the alcohol denatured or
denatured alcohol you probably want to
pass on this but there are also a lot of
hydrating ingredients in this as well
that may cancel out some of that effect
of the alcohol there are some good
alcohols denatured alcohol is not one of
them let's talk about some of the other
negative ingredients and then we'll go
into the positive so we have glycolic
acid in here which can be a positive or
a negative for some people usually it's
a positive it's just kind of the percent
that's in here doesn't seem to be a high
percent so I'm not concerned about it as
a negative I think of it more as a
positive in this product your real which
is a very strange name it can be an
irritant to some people then we have
malic acid which also has irritation
concerns it is an exfoliant
there's fragrance in here and also
there's two types of paraben in here so
if you like paraben free products you do
not want to get us now let's talk about
some of the positives the fifth
ingredient in this is the pineapple
extract I did do some research on
pineapple extract the information I did
find about this talked mostly about it
being a moisturizer and not only adding
moisture to the skin but also preventing
moisture loss in the skin there's also a
little bit of evidence suggest that it
could give good acne treatment we have
panthenol which is a moisturizer and
then the apple extract now the benefits
possible benefits of apple apple extract
apple extract elbow extract our that it
is skin conditioning it can also be an
astringent which I thought was kind of
interesting to have a skin conditioner
and an astringent and one I don't know
it can exfoliate and it also has
antioxidants in it a great ingredient
that's pretty high up is aloe aloe is a
wonderful ingredient for most people for
the skin so it was excited to see that
in here further down we have the Alan
Cohen and the purslane and then glycerin
so those are some of the good ones that
are in here so now let's go ahead and
try this stuff out so the directions are
to apply an ample amount to a cleanse
you dry face that's what I have now
massage can gently until clumps of
impurities start forming wash off with
lukewarm water so what I'm wondering
so a couple of demos of this and what
I'm wondering is if it's not the
impurities coming off its maybe it's
just the product balling up so I'm
curious of what I think when I try it so
let's go ahead and open it up and it
smells like alcohol it's got a very
strong put up right up to my nose a very
strong alcohol set with a little bit of
pineapple scent which does not smell
great to me I'm going to go ahead and
put my bear ears on I keep forgetting to
put my bear ears on I feel like they're
necessary for what the cake all right
there we go
bear ears are on and let's put some
alcohol on my face hopefully it won't
smell so strong when it's less
concentrated it doesn't say how much to
use it says an ample amount so we'll
start with about that much which is a
little bit but I'm scared to use too
much so let's go ahead see I can feel it
right away look I go like this it's
already starting to ball up I don't know
maybe it's my skin I don't know what
that is what is that what are you I'm
scared to put this on my face what is
that what is it I don't know it's
freaking me out okay well we're going to
get rid of that so I guess I'm not going
to rub the product between my fingers
before I put it on my face so I'm just
going to kind of blob this over my face
and said Lin gave this to me she said I
think she said it was her daughter that
really likes this product a lot I don't
know I'm scared
see I was feeling I just think it's just
the product it's blowing up I don't know
all right I think that's plenty okay let
us rub it in it feels very cold yeah I
think it's the product pulling up I
don't think that it's my skin or
impurities that's just my feeling that's
my gut feeling one thing that I read
about this is important not to get it in
the eye so I'm going to try to stay far
away from my eyes whoo I just like a
piece just fell in my eye that's not
good
ooh doesn't seem to be balling up as
much on my forehead maybe I need more I
don't know that's really gross looking
it does look like skin doesn't it ooh
that's gross looking ooh
and it's falling all over my lab ooh
okay I'm going to do a little bit more I
feel like maybe I didn't use enough I
don't know I'm just going to use a
little bit more on my forehead
especially I feel like it didn't really
ball up on my forehead oh the smell is
very strongly of alcohol so if you don't
like fragrance you're probably really
not gonna like this it's just falling
everywhere I'm assuming you're supposed
to do this in a bathroom I think that's
part of my problem is I'm not doing in a
bathroom so I'm going to go ahead and
wash this off and I'll be right back all
right I'm all washed off so let me say
it was very easy to wash the pieces down
the sink that was super easy to do it
came off very easily I do feel like my
skin is exfoliated like it feels
smoother it definitely feels a little
bit dry but I do feel like it did some
exfoliating it was that pieces of my
skin coming off I highly doubt it was it
dirt coming off my face maybe but I did
just cleanse my face so I don't really
know about that I think I don't know
maybe maybe it got in deeper into my
pores it's kind of hard to tell exactly
what it's doing it definitely feels like
it did something good except for that my
face does feel a little bit dry it
doesn't feel overly dry some products
really make my face feel like super
super tight so that's a good thing that
it doesn't feel extremely dry but I
don't know I just got a brainstorm of an
idea I have to know whether it's my skin
or if it's just the product so I just
ran downstairs and I got a couple of
plastic bags out looking for rubber
gloves but I couldn't find any rubber
gloves so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take this bag and I'm going to
pour some of the product on it so that
it never touches my skin then I'm going
to rub it together with another plastic
bag and see if it balls up on its own so
I'm just going to squirt some product
here I got a lot of product those
probably little too much oh
and then we're going to go back at these
and we're just going to rub it and see
if I can get it to fall up on its own
anybody listed ASMR is that a creaky
sound some people hate ASMR so I won't
see that anymore this the case you ate
it but I love the sound of crinkly bags
I don't know okay so let me zoom in
here's a bag with the goop on it and you
can see that there is some product there
that looks a little goofy but it's hard
to tell so I'm trying to think what do I
have that's black that I can oh okay
alright
sleek makeup alright let's scrape it on
and now let's tap with the bag I can't
get the same effect as I did when it was
on my face but it's definitely clumping
some on its own I just can't get it to
ball up the way that it does there we go
it's getting a little close there we go
look at that do you see the clump ease
so clumpy ZAR forming there's no human
contact my conclusion of that is that
the gritty stuff that appears is not
skin coming off but the actual product
falling up I don't know how they got it
to look like exfoliated skin but I've
actually quite impressed because if I
didn't know any better I would think
that was my actual skin flaking off but
it's not it was kind of a fun product to
you I do recommend if you do use this
that you do it with your eyes closed to
make sure none of those flakes fall into
your eyes because it's just a little bit
uncomfortable when it happens from
personal experience it bums me out that
there isn't a lot of research about
pineapple extract and Apple extract that
I found from credible sources now when I
talk about incredible stores I'm talking
about a medical source a source that
specializes in cosmetic ingredients
there are some articles in different
like web magazines and things like that
talking about the benefits but I find
that those aren't necessarily 100%
reliable I wish that I had found some
more reliable information about those
ingredients I do like that it has aloe
in it I personally like aloe and rice
skincare so that's a good thing kind of
on this
is on this one I wish the alcohol was in
there if the alcohol wasn't in there
this would definitely be very highly
rated but that alcohol is killing me so
I don't know I guess I'm going to have
to give this like a 3 heart rating
because I feel like it definitely did
something good for my skin but I don't
know the alcohols really making me like
and the smell is very strong of alcohol
which I don't like that kind of knocks
it down a couple of pegs but overall I
don't feel like it's a bad product I
think I will continue to use it but I
don't think I would repurchase it at
this point but if anything changes I
will add that to the description below
if nothing changes then I will keep
description just as it is so I want to
