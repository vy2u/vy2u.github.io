scary hello my friends welcome to
Pinterest Busters where I test Pinterest
pins to see if they are worth your time
and effort today we are going to be
testing something that's more of an
Instagram hack than a Pinterest pin but
it's starting to show up on Pinterest so
I'm counting it as a Pinterest Buster's
we are going to be applying false lashes
to the lower under part of our lashes
and I can tell you that I am absolutely
terrified of this I am more scared of
this than any other Pinterest Busters
I've ever done I am terrified I'm going
to lose an eye but I've seen enough
people on YouTube and on Instagram doing
this and loving it but now I feel like I
need to try it because who knows I may
love it my biggest concern is getting
the lash glue in my eye now I know that
this glue has been specifically made for
eyes but at the same time it's like you
know it says use only as directed and
they kind of say to put it on the
outside of your lash not inside your eye
so I'm a little scarred but we're gonna
try it anyway for the sake of science
and saving you your eyeballs oh you know
take one for the team on this one so
today we're going to be playing with the
Ardell 109 Naturals I love our Dell
lashes I love our Dell lash glue I am
NOT sponsored by our Dell I just really
love them I've seen this done two
different ways one way is to apply apply
the entire lash band the other way is to
cut it in half and then apply it we're
gonna start off by applying just the
entire lash band and see how that goes I
specifically chose these because they
have a very thin lash band I am scared
to put someone with a thick lash band
underneath inside my eyeball so I'm
gonna go ahead and I've already trimmed
this just a tiny bit and I'm gonna apply
the glue to the outside of the lash line
instead of the inside like I normally do
we're gonna start by applying this to
the left eye I'm very scared right now
alright here we go
oh I could feel it oh it's scary oh it's
scary it's not burning oh it's burning
oh oh oh this is not good I'm scared I'm
scared
I'm shaking right now oh my gosh my
vision is blurry I'm scared I'm scared
my vision is totally blurry out of
contacts and this was a terrible idea
I'm gonna glue my context to my eyeball
oh this was a terrible idea why did I do
this oh my gosh oh my gosh I'm so stupid
why did I just realize this like oh my
gosh of context and I totally gluing my
lash to my eyeball I mean my lash my
contact lens to my eyeball oh my gosh
okay this is this is not going to work
with the full lash band
I don't think okay maybe it is I'm gonna
run out of glue on this outer corner
just gonna try to hold it
nope I'm out of glue okay so now what do
I do
oh my gosh I'm so scared right now okay
I'm gonna try to put just a little bit
of glue just right on the outer corner
I'm gonna let it dry just for a second
oh my gosh
okay spread it up in there it actually
does look really pretty though off to
tell you that I don't know right now
whether it's sticking to my waterline or
my lashes and I'm hoping it's sticking
to my lashes and not my waterline okay
maybe we're sticking now and it looks
really pretty
it doesn't really really pretty yeah oh
my gosh I hate that I like this like
another thing I was concerned about it
was that it was gonna feel weird like it
was gonna feel like I'm wearing a lash
underneath and it was gonna be
uncomfortable and actually it's not
super uncomfortable I can definitely
tell that there's something there that's
not supposed to be there but it's not
uncomfortable and it definitely looks
more natural than than putting it on top
because I feel like it looks more like a
tight line rather than I have a lash
band over top okay so I'm gonna have to
put a little bit more glue on the inner
corner Eagles whoo let's do it down here
so that I'll be cool I end up just
sticking it to my lid like putting a
little tiny bit of glue on my lid and
now I'm gonna Pat the lash in on the
inner corner
okay all right we've done it so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna put the lash on
regular on the other side so you guys
can see the difference between them and
see which one you think looks nicer and
then I'm gonna try to remove my contact
lens and see if I've glued my contact
lens to my eyeball because that will be
horrible going to the doctor so how did
you do this well I was gluing fake
lashes inside my eyeball
so let's get a good close up of both
eyes so this one has it over top this
one has it underneath and honestly like
I can't even feel this one anymore
like I thought I would be able to feel
it for longer but I can't even feel that
I'm wearing a fake lash well maybe the
tiniest bit if I really really focus but
for the most part I can't even feel it
okay so let's look up so you can see how
it looks on the underside and then let's
look down I think I like this one better
but it scares me that I like this one
better
all right so final thoughts is this a
Pinterest Buster's win or fail and
unfortunately it is a win but why did
the view win I wanted it to be a fail
and if you're having trouble with this
technique this is something you can do
as you can do cut the lash in half and I
think it depends on the lash you're
using - I think some lashes you'll
probably have to cut in half some of
them you may have a better luck doing
the full band I would suggest trying the
full band first and seeing how that goes
and then moving to the the cut if you
feel like you need to cut it so I mean I
just I really like the way that it looks
I did go to the bathroom and try to
remove my contact lens and everything
was fine but I would recommend taking
not wearing contact lenses while you're
doing this and then when you're done
with putting it on then pop your contact
lens in your eye I know that can
sometimes mess up I make up in things
but I mean I'd rather do it that way
then have contact lenses in and have
them get ruined by putting glue on them
you know so I mean I guess it's just a
personal choice but I personally from
from now on I'm not going to have my
contact lenses and when I do this
technique but overall I mean I think it
looks great it feels great I like the
way it feels better than the way that
this one feels I you know I don't know I
like can't believe I like it Oh
definitely let me know whether you've
tried this technique in the comments
down below and if you have I'd love to
know what your thoughts are trying to
like get it to do weird things in it
just not it's not it's not feeling bad
at all I want it to feel bad but it does
it I can't make it suck I just can't
make it suck it's great if you enjoyed
