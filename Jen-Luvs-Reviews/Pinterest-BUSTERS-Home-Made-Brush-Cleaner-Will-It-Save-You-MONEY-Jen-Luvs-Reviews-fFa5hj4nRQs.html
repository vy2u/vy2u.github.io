Buster's this was a concept that I
created years ago and ended up dropping
because it was a lot of work to keep up
with so I stopped doing it because I
just didn't have time to commit to it
but now it's back it's a twist on
Mythbusters where we test Pinterest pins
and see if they actually work or not so
today we're focusing on cleaning our
makeup brushes because I've just fell in
love with this Benja balm this is a
brush cleaning balm it is $15 for this
balm and it looks like this and what you
do is you wet your brush you rub it in
there and then you rub it in your hand
and it works amazingly it is so amazing
super fab this is an all natural product
but it's very expensive so I checked on
Pinterest and I found quite a few
recipes for brush cleaner so I thought
we would try one today so the
ingredients you will need for this are
water dish soap and vinegar we are going
to be using just regular store brand
Wegmans brand white distilled vinegar
and a little bit of palm all live and I
want to see why there can keep up with
my been jebel we're gonna find out right
now okay so I've got my 1 cup of water
here I'm going to do 2 tablespoons of
vinegar
and one tablespoon of dish soap hey it's
pretty right alright so there should be
our brush cleaner solution definitely
smells like vinegar I can tell you that
okay let's go ahead and move our
concoction into the bathroom okay so one
of the most disturbing things about this
pin is that it shows dunking the brush
actually in the soap I'm not going to do
that because I'm scared I'm going to
ruin my brush by getting the ferrule and
inside the ferrule - what this is called
the ferrule if you weren't aware I don't
want to get inside that ferrule wet
because it can make my brush brush hairs
fall out so I'm just gonna kind of dab
this in here this is a flat kabuki brush
by beauty junkies this is my favorite
brand of brushes I'm really hoping I
don't ruin my brush and then I'm just
gonna kind of go like that Wow all the
makeup is definitely coming off I try to
define two brushes that were very
similar they're by the same brand
they're just different styles well it's
definitely coming off
I'm just gonna gently just gently
dipping so then it doesn't get all the
way into the ferrule so I did three dips
and at the end I'll rinse it off let me
see if I rinse it with some water at
this point how would you in here of
course I can't clean the exact same
brush twice so I just tried to get as
close as I could so that is actually
looking quite clean let's give it one
more dunk
I picked a dense brush on purpose
because they're notoriously harder to
clean it definitely still has some
foundation in there so we're going to
give it one last dunk and then we'll be
done with this brush and then we'll try
the Benja Bell on the other brush
alright that looks super incredibly
clean that looks amazing I don't know
man I don't know this this is working
way better than I thought it would
that's fantastic so I'm just gonna set
this here because I don't have my brush
tree in there I'm gonna set it here and
let's go with the Benja Bell so with the
Benja Bell don't like this with the
brush a swirl
and then we make a cup
their hand
I don't see how we're doing still quite
dirty
having trouble getting that spot right
there so let's look and compare the two
and it looks like they are pretty much
identical as far as how clean they are
scare to keep them zipped up too long I
don't want to ruin my Farrell's but they
look pretty identical look at that
that's awesome so I guess that's a
Pinterest Buster's win overall I mean
there is still a little bit of
foundation on both brushes brushes which
surprised me because I have really been
liking this and for whatever reason it's
not getting the little tiny bit in the
very center of the brush out so I don't
know if there would even be a better
cleanser than this that would even get
that little stain out I don't know there
are some questions that are left to be
had whether certain things would make a
difference I question whether the
vinegar would end up being harsh on the
brushes over time it is quite diluted so
it may not also I don't really know what
kind of foundation I used on either
brush whether it was the same foundation
different foundation so that could have
interfere they are a different shaped
brush which could have interfere so
there are definitely some things that
are left up to question as to whether
they truly are comparable or not but as
far as I'm concerned I would say that
this is just as good except for the fact
that you do need to make it every time
and that it is a liquid versus a solid
but if saving you know 15 bucks I mean
if you think about the cost of this
versus this I mean it's not even a
question I mean this is pennies versus
$15 so if you're on a budget for at this
point I have to recommend it to you that
you try this out so I want to thank you
so much for watching the first episode
