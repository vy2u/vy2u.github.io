online and then seen like on pinterest
or I just on a blog or whatever like
some advice on how to create a beauty
product or a makeup tip and like wow I
wonder if that actually works well I'm
wondering the exact same thing but I
figured instead of just doing it on my
own I would do it in front of you so we
can decide together whether it actually
works you're not and this one is a
lengthening eyelash technique that i
found on Pinterest and this is what it
says it says apply one coat of mascara
dip a q-tip in a little baby powder and
run it across the lashes focusing on the
tips the second coat will attach to the
powder for a longer fuller look awesome
pin do it yourself DIY ok so we will see
whether this works or not ok so I'm
going to be using my Neutrogena Healthy
links which is my new favorite mascara
for some reason the AL may get up and
grow is clumping on me after a month I
don't know you guys have the same
problem of the L may get up and grow I
don't know but yeah so I'm going to be
using this one because this is my
favorite right now and we are going to
see whether this works so it said to
apply one coat of mascara so we'll do
that
so that is one coat of the neutrogena
healthy lengths mascara so now we are
going to follow the directions and I'm
going to just put this on my right eye
whoa what everywhere it's focusing on
the tips they said I'm gettin powder oh
my goodness um this is not bright who
thought it is I'm getting powder in my
eyeball this was not a good idea this is
most kind of good now we shall apply the
second coat see if it lengthens the more
on the right then on the left we'll see
some clump in this happening
clash is starting to stick together a
little bit
well
I don't know about you but I can't tell
the difference between my two eyes can
you tell a difference if there is a
difference is not significant enough for
me to get powder all up in my eyeball in
order to do this technique I don't see
it noop noop noop noop so at least from
my first impressions this is a total
pinterest busters fail baby powder does
not lengthen your eyelashes in my
opinion with this particular mascara I
don't know maybe if with another mascara
it may work better I think i mighta
might see like some like crazy off to
the side stuff happening like maybe some
fibers from the actual q-tip got all my
lashes and now there's someone key stuff
happening over here but either way there
is not a big enough difference for me to
be putting baby powder on my eyelashes
in order to make them longer hope you
enjoyed that video mad love and I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
