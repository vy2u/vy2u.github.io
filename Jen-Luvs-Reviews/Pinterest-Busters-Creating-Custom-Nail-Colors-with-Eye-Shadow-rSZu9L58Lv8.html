bring you another pinterest buster is
now the last one was so successful
everybody seemed to really enjoy it when
I busted the myth of lengthening your
eyelashes with baby powder and I got
some really interesting comments on that
people telling me about you know that I
probably should have closed my eye yes
you're right that I probably shouldn't
have put baby powder next to my eye in
the first place again you're right but
it was a lot of fun to bust that myth so
I have another one for you and we will
see whether it works or not and here it
is my friends it is creating your own
nail polish shade using eyeshadow yes
you heard it right using eyeshadow
taking a clear nail polish stick at some
eye shadow in it spin it all around and
seeing if you can make your own custom
color so we are gonna see if that
actually works today okay so here's what
we're doing alright I have this Z
palette that I keep random eyeshadows
that I don't use for whatever random
reason I guess for Pinterest busters so
there is my deep potted covergirl
eyeshadow it's old I don't like it I
will never use it so I'm going to turn
it into a nail polish then i have this
sally hansen and nail growth clear nail
polish this is not a topcoat this is a
clear nail polish we're gonna mix those
two bad boys together and see if we can
make some magic happen yeah okay so
let's go ahead and follow these
instructions here all right it says to
take out the eyeshadow you want to use
and scrape it out of the container it
says use multiple colors i'm just going
to use the one and let's get this
eyeshadow out of here oh whoa holy moly
that wasn't hard that's right now super
green coming out didn't it all right
little lighting change there so you
cannot really see that color all right
crush it up in a powder form
okay I said empty a small amount of the
clear nail polish so you have room for
the eyeshadow powder okay I already did
that place your phone on the top and add
the color into the bottle all right so I
don't see how this color is going to get
into this little bottle here so I
figured what i would do is this works
for cakes maybe it'll work for eyeshadow
so i have a nice and icing tip in the
bag and then i'm going to cut this and
see if i can get it into the to let me
pull this up a little bit so you can see
this process here okay i'm going to take
the one shot at this so hopefully i do
okay here we go make sure this is
recording because i don't got another
shot if this doesn't work all right make
sure that it's out of the way okay and
let's see if we can get this eyeshadow
in here a little bit soon it's very hard
to get out this is definitely messy oh
it's getting everywhere simile mostly
falling on the plate though as you can
see a lot fell on the plate but let's
work let's see what we've got to work
with and let's let's just keep going and
we'll see what happens so let's take
this funnel out okay next step is to use
a toothpick to mix the color up into the
bottle here's the progress I don't know
it's looking pretty good over here ok
and now put the top on that's how it's
looking so far okay let's give it a
shake no no looking kind of cool there
shake it up some more wow I might
actually be working okay so that's how
it's looking so far okay i'm going to
remove some nail polish and see if we
can see what this stuff looks like all
right so i cleaned the polish off two
nails see how this stuff works mmm very
sheer very very sheer but the colors
there
alright so that's definitely not going
to work for opacity we're going to have
to get some of this some more the shadow
in here looks cool but it's way too
sheer alright i'm just going to do my
best to get the rest of them going to
repeat this baggie process and try to
get more of that shadow in there okay so
I've pretty much got as much eyeshadow
in there as I could and this is what
I've got as far as color goes as you can
see I've made a huge mess all over my
hands and my desk everything is a hot
mess shake it up real good and let's try
the final test oh that's not bad that's
not bad at all so that's the first code
this might actually work well I have the
the very very sheer code I'm not
counting that one well let that dry and
we'll come back for the second coat a
for sanity's sake I've washed my hands
it's been about 5-7 minutes I like to
wait a while between my coat let's go
ahead and do coat number two well that's
too thick hold on a minute wait a minute
here that is some serious pigmentation
that isn't that some decent opacity if I
have been able to get all of this shadow
in then it would be even better i'm sure
but I mean I spilled a ton of it so
that's looking really good let's let it
dry one more time and let's do a third
coat alright so we're back for coat
number three okay this will be the final
coat because I don't ever put more than
three coats on Oh still too much I mean
it looks gorgeous on the brush I think
this is going to work look at that that
is crazy and I didn't even get all the
eyeshadow into the bottle so if i had
been able to get more eyeshadow into the
bottle it would have been even more
pigmented than that that is cool so this
is very exciting this is a pinterest
busters win
it is not a fail it is a total win this
actually worked when you can create your
own custom nail colors with eyeshadow
and clear nail polish how cool is that
now is this cost effective no because
you're still going to have to pay the
same price for a clear nail polish that
you would have to pay for a color nail
polish it plus you're paying for the
eyeshadow unless it's something you
would thrown away anyway um is it fun
maybe for me it kind of was um is it
messy yes um and but it's really cool to
be able to make your own color if you
happen to have an eyeshadow you really
like or if you see at the dollar store
some eyeshadow and maybe even some nail
polish you might be able to make a
really cool color um just at whatever
color you like I mean how awesome is
that so um yeah definitely try it out
let me know if you do let me know what
color you make I've always wanted to
name a nail polish so this is my own
custom Sally Hansen nail color and I'm
going to dedicate this to my students
