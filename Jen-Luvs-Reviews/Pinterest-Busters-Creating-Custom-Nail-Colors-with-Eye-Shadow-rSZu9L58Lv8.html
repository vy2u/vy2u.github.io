bring you another Pinterest Buster is
now the last one was so successful
everybody seemed to really enjoy it when
I busted the myth of lengthening your
eyelashes with baby powder and I got
some really interesting comments on that
people telling me about you know that I
probably should have closed my eye yes
you're right
that I probably shouldn't have put baby
powder next to my eye in the first place
again you're right but it was a lot of
fun to bust that mess
so I have another one for you and we
will see whether it works or not and
here it is my friends it is creating
your own nail polish shade using
eyeshadow yes you heard it right using
eyeshadow taking a clear nail polish
stick it some eyeshadow in it spin it
all around and seeing if you can make
your own custom color so we're gonna see
if that actually works today okay so
here's what we're doing all right I have
this Z palette that I keep random
eyeshadows that I don't use for whatever
random reason I guess for Pinterest
Buster's so there is my deep potted
covergirl eyeshadow it's old I don't
like it I will never use it so I'm gonna
turn it into a nail polish then I have
this Sally Hansen and nail growth clear
nail polish this is not a topcoat this
is a clear nail polish we're gonna mix
those two bad boys together and see if
we can make some magic happen yeah okay
so let's go ahead and follow these
instructions here all right it says to
take out the eye shadow you want to use
and scrape it out of the container it
says use multiple colors I'm just gonna
use the one and let's get this eyeshadow
out of here
oh whoa holy moly that wasn't hard
that's right now super green coming out
didn't it alright little lighting change
there so you can really see that color
alright crush it up in a powder form
okay I said empty a small amount of the
clear nail polish so you have room for
the eyeshadow powder okay I already did
that place your phone on the top and add
the color into the bottle all right so I
don't see how this color is going to get
into this little bottle here so I
figured what I would do is this works
for cakes maybe it'll work for eyeshadow
so I have a nice and icing tip in the
bag and then I'm going to cut this and
see if I can get it into the - let me
pull this up a little bit so you can see
this process here okay I'm gonna take
the one shot at this so hopefully I do
okay here we go make sure this is
recording because I don't got another
shot if this doesn't work alright make
sure that it's out of the way okay and
let's see if we can get this eyeshadow
in here okay a little bits in it's very
hard to get out this is definitely messy
everywhere Emily mostly falling on the
plate though as you can see a lot fell
on the plate but let's work let's see
what we've got to work with and let's
let's just keep going and we'll see what
happened so let's take this funnel out
okay next step is to use a toothpick to
mix the color up into the bottle here's
the progress no it's looking pretty good
over here
okay and now for the top on that's how
it's looking so far okay let's give it a
shake no no looking kind of cool there
shake it up some more
wow I might actually be working okay so
that's how it's looking so far okay I'm
gonna remove some nail polish and see if
we can see what this stuff looks like
alright so I cleaned the polish off two
nails let's see how this stuff works
mm very sheer very very sheer but the
colors there
all right so that's definitely not going
to work for opacity we're gonna have to
get some of this some more of this
shadow in here looks cool but it's duay
to sheer all right I'm just gonna do my
best to get the rest of them gonna
repeat this baggy process and try to get
more of that shadow in there
okay so I've pretty much got as much eye
shadow in there as I could and this is
what I've got as far as color goes as
you can see I've made a huge mess all
over my hands and my desk everything is
a hot mess let's shake it up real good
and let's try the final test oh that's
not bad that's not bad at all
so that's the first code this might
actually work well I have the the very
very sheer code I'm not counting that
one well let that dry and we'll come
back for the second code okay for
sanity's sake I've washed my hands it's
been about five seven minutes I like to
wait a while between my coats let's go
ahead and do coat number two whoa that's
too thick hold on a minute wait a minute
here that is some serious pigmentation
that isn't that's some decent opacity if
I have been able to get all of this
shadow in then it would be even better
I'm sure but I mean I spilled a ton of
it so that's looking really good let's
let it dry one more time and let's do a
third coat all right so we're back for
coat number three okay this will be the
final coat because I don't ever put more
than three coats on don't too much I
mean it looks gorgeous on the brush I
think this is going to work look at that
that is crazy and I didn't even get all
the eyeshadow into the bottle so if I
have been able to get more eyeshadow
into the bottle it would have been even
more pigmented than that that is cool so
this is very exciting this is
a Pinterest Buster's win it is not a
fail it is a total win this actually
worked when you can create your own
custom nail colors with eye shadow and
clear nail polish how cool is that now
is this cost effective no because you're
still gonna have to pay the same price
for a clear nail polish that you would
have to pay for a colored nail polish it
plus you're paying for the eye shadow
unless it's something you would've
thrown away anyway is it fun maybe for
me it kinda was um is it messy yes um
and but it's really cool to be able to
make your own color if you happen to
have an eye shadow you really like or if
you see at the dollar store some eye
shadow and maybe even some nail polish
you might be able to make a really cool
color um and just whatever color you
like I mean how awesome is that
so um yeah definitely try it out let me
know if you do let me know what color
you make I've always wanted to name a
nail polish so this is my own custom
Sally Hansen nail color and I'm going to
dedicate this to my students and I'm
going to call this tell me a story I
