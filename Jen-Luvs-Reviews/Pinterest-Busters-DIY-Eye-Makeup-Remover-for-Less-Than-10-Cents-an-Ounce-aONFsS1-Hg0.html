Petrus Buster's I'm so excited you
pictures buzzers I love Pinterest
busters it is so much fun and I don't
know why I don't do them more often they
really really are fun now I did get a
request to a bus this app in by this
person down here thank you so much for
requesting it if you have a request for
a pin you'd like busted go ahead and
leave it in a comment down below and I
will try my best to get to it basically
what I love to do is I love to find
wonderful things on pinterest and then
see if it actually works now I've tried
quite a few things i will put a link
down below to all of the Pinterest
Buster's I've done in the past such as
making your own custom nail color I did
does pam cooking spray dry your nail
polish faster the kool-aid lip balm is
the other one I did was a kool-aid
vaseline lip balm was the last one that
I did and they're just so much fun to
see whether they work and you get to see
on camera what is happening as you as I
do it to see whether something you would
like to try or not so this pin is all
about making I makeup remover this is
the pin I'm going to put a picture of it
right there and basically you use water
baby shampoo and a little bit of oil now
they recommended using baby oil at first
but then the woman who created the pin
said people were giving her a bunch of
flack about using baby oil on at all
that it's just bad for you especially
around the eye area so she then
recommended change it to either using
olive oil or coconut oil I chose to use
extra virgin olive oil because that's
what I happen to have in my house and
also I've cut the amount of makeup
remover in half just so that it's more
manageable to do I'm going to go ahead
and show you the mixture right now okay
so basically what it says in the pin is
just to add these ingredients together
and mix them up so I've got everything
pre-measured here for us and we're going
to see how it goes so I'm just going to
take this this is the baby shampoo I'm
just going to pour that in
it's not going in very easily just going
to kind of scoop that out my hands are
clean up promise if you have a small
little spatula that might be a good idea
in hindsight try to get all this shampoo
out and then our little tiny bit of
olive oil okay I did put a little bit of
extra a little I mean it was a sixteenth
of a teaspoon so I put probably a little
more than that there is a little bit
left in here so I think it'll end up
being pretty accurate and this is a half
a cup of water so i'm going to go ahead
and put that together and then i'm going
to shake it and see what happens I'm
getting very soupy soupy okay so there
is our product okay and we'll see what
looks like inside probably not going to
be too surprising what it looks like it
looks like bubbles it looks like shaking
up shampoo and water is what it looks
like so we'll see how this works so I've
sumed in I put my hair back so nothing
interferes and I have transferred my
solution to a spray bottle because I
noticed there was a lot of foam on top
and I wanted to be able to shake this
and not worry about the foam interfering
with the application process now I'm
going to compare this to my Holy Grail I
makeup remover which is the Mary Kay
oil-free eye makeup remover this stuff
is amazing and you as you can see it
does have its own little oil in there
but the ratio of oil to whatever this
stuff is is definitely more than what i
put in here so we will see how this
works so we're going to go ahead and I'm
going to start off with the new stuff so
I'm going to shake it up real good and
I'm just going to spray it on to this
cotton swab here we'll make sure it's
nice and saturated the spray is really
crazy okay feels good ok so I'm going to
do let's do three swipes on the right I
ready here we go
oh it definitely feels wet enough
how we looking
how's that how's it looking ok so now
let's try the Mary Kay shake it up here
the Furby in the background mm-hmm my
husband woke up the Furby total total
video shooting fail waking up the Furby
jumped out of the closet at me all right
let's continue okay so here comes the
Mary Kay let's do three swipes one two
three okay how are we looking
okay I gotta look at a mirror for the
initial thought here um yup so far Mary
Kay's looking better let's go ahead and
do another one all right here we go
ready three more sweats 23 okay and then
back on Mary Kay
two
Mary Kay definitely feels oily or I'll
tell you that I just cleaned up too good
let me clean up a little more over here
and make it fair and you know i'm
testing here not just for speed but also
efficiency so it looks like mary kay is
definitely performing better the eye
makeup on this side is almost completely
removed with this one I definitely still
have eyeliner I definitely still have
all my mascaras doing pretty good i was
wearing um the bad gal lash is it
benefit benefits bad gal lash which is
not a waterproof mascara at this point
I'm drawing the conclusion that the Mary
Kay does work more efficiently now I'm
going to work with my concoction and see
if it I can get it to work I mean with
with you know relatively minimal effort
so you know so let's just try to make
sure that this is just see if it'll work
so I'm just gonna rub until I feel like
my cotton swab cotton swab oh so my
cotton ball is clean well it seems like
it's not removing any more
all right I know I'm so tough on my eyes
I'm gonna pay for it later i know i will
i still feel like I have a shadow of
eyeliner on but I feel like overall it
has removed my makeup it's gone people
it's gone so yeah it works it definitely
works so overall i would consider this a
pinterest busters win i think it is a
wonderful product for so stinkin cheap
if you're looking for some eye makeup
remover i highly recommend trying this
what i would a question for next time
would be if i added just a little more
oil whether that would improve the
performance of the product so we can't
we can't argue against the fact that it
actually works is it as efficient as my
mary kay no it's not but it is
ridiculously cheaper so if you are
looking for some makeup remover and
you're on a budget big old thumbs up i
hope you enjoyed this pinterest busters
