pinterest busters this is my favorite
series right now other than Vesta Beauty
I'm absolutely loving doing Pinterest
Busters it is so fun it's kind of like a
Mythbusters but for Pinterest you know
to tsiyon the pin that I've been asked
to bust by two different people
those two people ask me if cooking spray
could dry your nail polish faster so we
are going to try that today but first we
need some nail polish so I wanted to
show you I figured I'd work this in you
know I'm saying I work in my Ipsy bag
into this since I did get two nail
polishes on my Ipsy that cute little bag
vinyl like rising a jelly sandals from
back in the day ladies that are in their
30s and maybe late 20s might know what
I'm talking about but they remind me of
my old jelly sandals so very very cute
almost an iridescent purpley kind of
pink there and we got this big sexy hair
weatherproof humidity resistant sprite
if you don't care about this stuff click
here and we'll go straight to the
pictures busters okay but here I'm
interested in trying this because my
hair gets extremely frizzy when I don't
take care of it after watched on my
previous videos when I didn't just do my
hair you'll see the frizz happened so
I'm really excited to try this I've had
good and bad things happening with big
sexy hair products so we shall see about
that pop of beauty
now pixie products I've had a horrible
time with pixie products but I have not
tried anything by pop u t it's the same
company this is their high-end line and
this is a pouty pop crayon in the color
coral crush and I will swatch that for
you okay there's the swatch there for
you there and you can see it's just a
bright bright I don't really see a lot
coral in this but I see a lot of pink
but but anyway either way it is really
really pretty on it's very smooth it
kind of reminds me of the witch call it
the covergirl moisture smooth color
sticks but I think I might and this one
looks a little chunkier in formulation
like it might seep into the lines in
your lips or any kind of dryness a
little bit more than that one but I mean
if when it wants a
lenz it looks really nice so we will see
we then got this on cool a mineral
sunscreen this is a very small sample so
this is probably only going to work
maybe once or twice but I am happy to
have it and it is unscented and it's an
organic Sun care and then we got this I
love this and I'm just starting to see
more about BH Cosmetics all around the
Internet's they have it on a little
black bag right now they have some BH
Cosmetics stuff I'm seeing more people
reviewing it but this is really cute
this little California collection
eyeshadow sample and it's got one of
those little cody codes the skin on your
phone and you open that up and that's
what's inside okay so those are the
three colors we got Hollywood San
Francisco and Malibu and here are two
the three swatches so those are those
there whoa that yellow is crazy so that
was just one quick swatch that Malibu
yellow looks amazing the other two look
kind of ant let's do another swatch just
to see wholly visually okay so on the
second swatch San Francisco got a little
better but Hollywood still looks pretty
stinky so I will try those and let you
know that gold is gorgeous I'm really
looking forward to using that Malibu Oh
beautiful and then the last things I got
were the two polishes I got this Nicole
by OPI polish from the Selena Gomez
collection I got this because I had two
people sign up using my Ipsy link so I
thank those two people so I will be
using this for Pinterest Busters and I
will also be using this nail teenie nail
polish that we got I don't see the name
of the color anywhere but it's like a
coral orange it's really pretty so now
into the Pinterest Buster's portion of
this video so if you are an interested
to seeing whether Pam will dry these
nail polishes faster keep on watching
alright so for my nails today I haven't
done any of you I just put my hand on
the ground that's gross
I haven't done anything tomatoes I
didn't even put a base coat on them
because I don't want anything
influencing the result and we are going
to test it using handy-dandy okay
because I realized that I probably don't
want to get that cloth that was actually
my pillowcase get oil all over it I'm
just gonna do it straight on this box
please excuse the ugly box let's start
with the Nicole by OPI Selena Gomez nail
polish and imma start the timer ready
set go it's such a pretty color oh my
goodness I'm being real messy so trying
to go fast okay spray it right here I
feel it's still wet EW gross okay I'll
shake it off a little bit okay
it's very oily okay it has been 24
seconds since I started the timer okay
it's now been 30 seconds so let's go
ahead and scratch these okay they both
scratch you can see there's bubbles on
the nail I wonder if that's going to
affect the color in the end it has now
been one minute on scratch them still
scratches this lip this one's definitely
you know they both scratch it pretty bad
alright it's now been two minutes a
little less scratchy they're a little
bit less scratchy but still scratching
is really ugly the way that spraying
that polish you know it's been three
minutes
still scratching they're still
scratching there okay it has now been
four minutes this one looks pretty dry
this one's still scratching let me try
that one again and see if this is truly
dry this one is dry okay
it has now been five minutes let's try
this this one this nail is dry this nail
is almost dry I still see a little
scratch hey has now been six minutes and
it's still scratching okay has now been
seven minutes seven minutes yup seven
minutes and this nail is now dry so
that's the results for the Selena Gomez
pop next you're going to try the nail
teeny and see what happens with that but
I'm going to go wash my hands first my
hands are washed you can see the final
finish on these nail polishes I mean of
course it's messy because I did it as
quickly as I could to make sure that
they didn't dry it all before I sprayed
the polish but look at all that clumping
yuck
okay let's try the nail teenie we're
going to do nail teenie on these two
nails and we'll spray this one and not
that one ready set go
right
in 15 seconds that one doesn't seem to
have made I don't know as much of a mess
on the polish we'll see okay it's now
been 30 seconds Tati scratch big scratch
sure this stuff sure does feel gross
I'll tell you that okay it has now been
one minute since I started the timer
still a small scratch still a big
scratch ouch
just sat on the toothpick that really
hurt let's delve in two minutes let's
scratch switch sides here that one is
dry this one is drying well now we know
nail teenie dries faster than Nicole by
OPI okay it has now been three minutes I
switch toothpicks here
this one is completely dry and that one
is completely dry so it only took one
extra minute for this nail to dry over
the Pam spray nail but it did dry the
Pam did dry the nails faster so why is
that a pincers Buster's when I don't
really know did it technically work yeah
it technically dried the nails faster
okay but it ruined the finish of the
polish so let me show you a close-up so
there is a close-up of the nails so you
can see that these two nails over here
were the ones that were sprayed with Pam
the finish is gotten kind of matte and
clumpy these are just scratched because
of course I scratched them with the
toothpick but I didn't scratch them
these would still look clumping so final
result does it dry nails faster yes but
will I do it absolutely not I hope you
