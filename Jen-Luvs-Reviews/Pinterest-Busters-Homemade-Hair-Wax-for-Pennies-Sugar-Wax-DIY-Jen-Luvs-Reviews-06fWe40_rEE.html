where I test Pinterest pins for you to
see if they actually work and whether or
not they are worth your time and effort
because sometimes Pinterest pins can be
kind of fun but it's a long process and
it's not any fun if it's not any fun you
know what I'm saying so today we're
gonna test the pin about making a hair
removal wax out of sugar I'm just gonna
go ahead and take you right into my
kitchen and show you how I made this
alright so I found a few different
recipes for this with different
proportions they're all the same
ingredients just different proportions
and since this is the very first time
that I'm doing this I'm going to wing it
if you have a different way that you've
done this before I would love to know
what proportions you use but for this
particular video we're gonna use two
cups of sugar a quarter cup of lemon
juice one of the recipes call for a
quarter cup of water but a lot of them
were like two tablespoons so I'm gonna
use like an eighth of a cup of water I'm
gonna pour in about half of this and
just kind of hope that the proportions
are good so I'm gonna put this on medium
heat some of them said low heat to
simmer but to be honest with you I don't
want to take that long to do this so I'm
just gonna put it on medium heat and it
for the best and then hopefully it won't
burn I will keep a good eye on it and
you can see it's already kind of turning
into a thick paste honey so we are going
to let this simmer until it turns a
golden brown it is 12:53 so we'll see
how long that takes as you can see it's
bubbling and it starting to change
colors a little bit it's almost like a
left yellowy
any kind of color at this point we're
about five minutes into the cooking
process but it just started to simmer I
could tell it was simmering a little too
much so I turned the heat down to low it
was on medium and now it's on well for
now ten minutes into the cooking process
it's definitely gotten a little more
clear in color but it's definitely not
brown yet so I'm stirring this about
every minute or so I'm giving it a good
stir the other thing is it's a little
bit spilled from the spatula so I ate a
little bit of it and it tastes delicious
so if you ever want to eat your wax like
it's really yummy now they don't touch
it right now though because you will
burn your finger and you will have to go
to the hospital because I'm sure that
this is insanely hot this looks pretty
golden-brown it looks really nice I'm
not trying to overcook it so I think I'm
gonna take it off the heat now because
it seems like it is the right color I
might be undercooking it a little bit
because some of the recipes did look
darker than this but then some of them
looked about a little lighter than this
it smells really good it's definitely
gotten aroma like that lemony sugar
aroma so I'm thinking it's done because
from cooking what I learned is when it
starts smelling good it's probably done
so we just turn off the heat we're gonna
pour this into a few mason jars if you
have anything glass I'm sure that would
be fine before I do that though I do
want to heat these a little bit so I'm
gonna put them in my toaster oven for a
minute and let them heat up for just a
minute I don't want any glass breaking
I'm nervous about that so I've got to
prepare just in case you don't spill
don't spill I'm gonna clean it up
oh maybe we'll just fit it in one we
might not need to almost almost
so now we're gonna let these cool I let
them cool for about ten minutes and then
we'll try it out all right timers done
so they've been just sitting here on the
oven for ten minutes and I'll show you
the consistency of it it's still thin I
did test a tiny bit on my hand and it's
definitely still too hot so I'm going to
cheat and I'm going to put this in the
refrigerator I don't know I'm scared of
cheat I don't want to cheat it away
maybe
I don't know John Little John movie
thing II think I should put in the
refrigerator to make it go faster yes
okay all right okay so this jar has now
been sitting in the refrigerator for ten
minutes
this one's just been sitting on the
counter this one is from really hot
still I'm gonna try just to get the
tiniest little bit I'm so scared I'm
gonna burn myself mmm doesn't feel so
bad it's still really hot though it
looks like it's a good consistency
though if you look at it see it doesn't
feel so hot now I don't know maybe this
might work just kind of blow on it like
they do with the salon I don't know I
think we might be ready I think we might
be good to go this is really sticky
scared we'll say we're gonna use the
refrigerated jar this one's just gonna
stay here I'm gonna put a lid on it all
right so I got my wax and I got my knife
and finally gonna get to shave my legs
it is the middle of August and I not
shaved my legs in like a week at least
so my hair is nice and long I wanted to
grow it out because I knew I was gonna
do this video so yeah you're gonna see
my pasty hairy i'm moisturized legs
because you can't have any moisturizer
on when you do this it's got to be like
clean dry legs so I'm gonna show you
I've got bring this down lone bit so we
got my pasty hairy a she lay and we're
gonna try this out and see how it goes
hopefully I do not burn myself so you're
supposed to put this on the opposite
direction of hair growth and then you're
supposed to pull it off along with the
hair growth
so having trouble getting it not to make
a mess so please don't burn me please
don't burn me oh it's not bad it feels
like regular wax all right pasting it on
just like basting it based on a turkey
all right how's it looking good all
right and then we roll it up a little
bit and on a minute and we pull oh well
got some of the hairs off oh no can't
imagine doing my whole leg like this all
right so now that's too cool to use so
that's done I cannot imagine doing my
whole leg all right let's do it again
did I not do it right I don't know okay
so you know go over here this time paint
it on it's a little bit warm but it's
not too terrible we're supposed to pull
it this way I pulled it the wrong way
you got to wait for it to dry a little
bit and there's recipes where you can do
this with actual strips like they use at
the salons but ain't nobody got time to
go get this all right here we go just
making a mess okay now it's coming up
okay
ready set go
oh that worked that worked really well
that one worked great see if I can get
this to do it again just
it definitely works better go in the
other direction
yeah no way I'm doing a whole leg like
this tell you that let's do one more one
more patch let's do some I hate shaving
my knees so let's do mani that's my
least favorite thing because I always
get scared I'm gonna cut myself and
that's all string is making a huge mess
but once it dries it's not like it just
becomes like a ball so it's not bad once
it dries ready set go
I mean it got it but it's still not like
I would have to shave again to get all
the hairs it's not getting all the hairs
so that's how it's looking it just it
didn't get all the hairs it is
definitely less painful than other times
that I've used traditional wax I go get
my eyebrows done a couple of times a
month I've gotten my legs waxed before
and it's really painful this is really
not hardly there's hardly any pain at
all I mean you can definitely feel it
but it's definitely the least painful
hair removal I have ever tried I've
never gotten my eyebrows threaded so I
can't compare it to that but it's
definitely very mild in comparison with
with plucking hairs out typically now
the question is is this a Pinterest
Buster's win or is it a fail well I
think it just depends there's a lot of
factors here number one may be something
could be better with my ingredients and
how I used it number two maybe it's just
me not having practiced with it I'm
trying to do these Pinterest Buster's as
a first impression you want to know from
first experience whether it's gonna be
easy or difficult so I feel like
practice is almost you know deceiving
because I want to give you what it's
really going to be like for someone to
do this pin and I felt like that the
process of making it was a bit
time-consuming but I can see where that
would be fun for some people to make
that and it'd be a little time-consuming
the actual removal process for me was a
little inefficient maybe it was the way
that I was removing the wax maybe it was
the temperature of the wax but I found
it to be not something that I would want
to spend a ton of time waxing my legs
like that
it also will depend on how long my legs
stay not needing to be shaved I mean
maybe this will help my hair not to grow
back for a longer period of time than
actual shaving the other thing that's
really good about this is that it is
good for the environment
there's no harmful chemicals if you have
sensitive skin this would be a great way
to use wax for sensitive skin maybe this
would be great for facial hair like if
you go a little stache going on this
might be fantastic because it will be
super fast just to get small areas but
my legs have a lot of space on them and
they got lots of hair so I just don't
feel like I want to take half an hour 45
minutes to get every little part
especially to the point where it removes
every single hair now the other thing is
the hair growth on my legs I had quite a
long growth on my legs I also don't have
super thick hair I don't know how it
would work on coarse hair I don't know
where how it work on super fine hair so
there's lots of different factors going
in I have I guess medium coarseness but
I feel like my hair or my legs are it's
pretty thin compared to some people I
don't have a big bushy hair I mean this
is pretty much fully grown out as like
how long my leg hair gets doesn't get
much longer than this so I mean I don't
know I mean I think this at this point
you're gonna have to decide for you
whether this is something you want to
try whether it's worth the time you're
putting into it whether it's worth you
know thus if you have really sensitive
skin for me personally this was a fail
this is something I'm never gonna do I'm
never going to use again I'll probably
use up the wax that I mean I do have
this huge jar left and then I've got
about a quarter of a jar in the other
one so I'll probably use this up and
worst case I'll use it as like a yogurt
topping because it's really delicious it
tastes amazing I mean all it is is sugar
and lemon juice in water so you know
stress a little wrong a little bit of
Greek yogurt it'll probably be amazing I
let my son taste a little bit my
five-year-old he loved it so it'll get
used one way or another whether it be
consumed or use of my legs I haven't
decided yet but it was a fun project I'm
glad I did it but I don't think I'm
gonna be doing it again so that's it for
