of all random places and it's a little
echoey in here echo so I'm excited to
bring you another pinterest busters I
have no one to shoot this for like two
months I'm not even kidding this video
was requested by this person right there
thank you so much and I have one lined
up for next Pinterest busters hopefully
this one won't take two months to make
but I wanted to make sure that I had the
right products to do this someone told
me that I needed to use a petroleum free
Vaseline so I was looking for it looking
for and look for that I was like well
you know maybe I need to look on the
Vaseline website to see if it exists and
it doesn't now we are going to use the
regular Vaseline in order to see whether
we can make our own lip balm from
kool-aid I'll put the picture right
there of what the pin looked like and it
linked to a blog I'm looking at it down
here we are going to be using the cocoa
butter Vaseline this was the one that I
had in my house and I feel like it's got
a really nice little smell to it I think
it would make I think it would make a
really nice lip balm I know that that
Trillium is not the best thing for your
lips I understand this I don't need the
comments that you got with Julie Manya
lips but most chapstick products do have
petroleum in them or petrolatum whatever
you want to call it so we've got our
Vaseline the cocoa butter and we've got
our cherry flavored kool-aid it says to
put a cup of Vaseline in a microwave
microscope we're gonna put a cup of
Vaseline and a microwave safe Bowl now I
personally do not own a microwave
our microwave broke my husband has this
you know crazy theory that microwaves
will kill us and then it's
good for our food so I haven't bought
one yet I will probably break down a by
one eventually but we do not own a
microwave so I'm going to put this on
the stovetop and heat it up
just a quarter-cup feel I seriously do
not need 1/2 a cup of lip balm if you're
joining microwave it says do it at
30-second increments and she said it
took her three to four minutes to do it
this took me about a minute to melt it
in here maybe a minute and a half was
super fast to melt it in my pot okay now
it says to stir in the cool a crystal
something to show you what that looks
like
put the melted vaseline into a clear
bowl so we can see what's happening and
I'm just gonna add some of this kool-aid
and let's add a little bit and see what
happens here mmm looks very clunky right
now
I'm expected to turn like a bright pink
or you know about this stuff well you
know what I'll do is I'm just gonna put
this whole pack of kool-aid in here even
though it's a quarter cup let's just
dump it in man let's just let's just go
with it
I like flavor here let's see one hands
Oh My lordy now we got some color going
on here there's some pigmentation home
the wrong crazy I tell you
let's taste a little bit that's just oh
why did I do that to finds out why Oh
terrible I don't know why I did that I
totally just ate it like it was a speck
off using my face I just totally tasted
it that was stupid
Oh what did I do that for oh that was
Darwin it was awful
okay I am going to have to put some
sugar in this baby because that that was
disgusting okay so I'm gonna grab some
of this sugar I'm just gonna grab a
spoonful sugar
Wow can you guys see that
let's add that in there for you it
doesn't not melt then maybe it'll turn
into an exfoliator seems like it's
starting to cool on me a little bit okay
all right now I'm gonna put it in my jar
so this is a container that I got in a
sample box I hid which one but I just
cleaned it out after I was done with the
cleanser and just saved the container I
have let this sit for about an hour okay
so that's how it came out it's very hard
okay and let's swatch not pigmented
I definitely feel some grit so if you do
decide to do this make sure that you
reheat it until all of the crystals are
melted I could not do that I'm not going
to take the time to go back and do it
but I know that if I were going to do
this in the future that I would
definitely reheat it and make sure
everything is melted because those
definitely some grit there that I would
not enjoy putting on my lips smells
pretty good it smells a little and I can
really smell the cocoa butter that's
another thing I like you differently as
I wouldn't use the cocoa butter Wood is
a pretty much only smoked cocoa butter I
don't know if that's gonna work out well
so let's go ahead and taste it let's put
on my lips it's kind of stinging my lips
a little bit
I definitely feel the grid oh my gosh oh
that's terrible
oh that's awful it's like super super
sour oh it feels slimy it's definitely
the wrong texture like for a lip balm
it's very very greasy feeling I mean it
feels like Vaseline it's very greasy and
I'm not used to that I'm just not used
to a Vaseline lip balm and it's ace of
it it's like it's extremely sour I mean
I can kind of taste the cherry a little
bit but it's super super sour I am not
enjoy this at all
no it's kind of interesting look now
that I'm looking at it it's staining my
lips I had this whole ending about how
this was a fail and now I'm thinking
that might actually kind of like this as
a lip stain rather than a lip balm I'm
like looking in the monitor I'm kind of
like the way that that looks
I might actually keep this up the flavor
is not good I think that the ratio of
kool-aid to Vaseline was definitely
often that was on me I chose to do that
but the actual steam effect of that is
actually kind of
oh no I'm gonna let y'all decide whether
this is a win or a fail taste this
terrible texture is not very good I
definitely need to heat it more to get
the crystals out so it's not gritty but
this actually looks kind of pretty so
let me know whether you think this was a
winner no is this something that you
might try to do and see whether you like
it or not I don't know I'm on the fence
