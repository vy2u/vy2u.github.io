you a one product review so in case
you're interested in this particular
product then that is all this video is
going to be about and nothing else
nothing more nothing less
so one of the reviewing today is the
pixie soft focus fresh pallet this is
the only pixie product that I own so I
don't know if this applies to other
pixie products or just this one but this
is kind of what I thought so what I
decided to do was I did all of my makeup
is only pick only comes from this pallet
except for I did use my foundation and
my press my powder and I used some Urban
Decay primer potion and I used some
mascara but other than that everything
else is directly from the palette okay
so let me show you what you get oh by
the way I got this off of hautelook this
was the second palette that I got that
came broken so this one this is what you
get this is the one that came broken I
ended up getting this for free which is
really nice that they did that they gave
this to me for free and they gave me a
$10 credit because it came broken so I
was really nice them thanks out luck
comes with a big mirror and it's a
little dusty because it had the freaking
product and I never really like sprayed
and cleaned it like super good but it's
got a nice mirror look you can see the
whole set look it's me looking at me
looking at me so you get one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve eyes shadow 's and you get
a nice blush and then this is another
blush you've got a little and some
contouring stuff so you've got kind of a
couple of bronzy looking things and some
highlighters you also get three lip
glosses okay so when I saw this I was
super excited about it because I really
want to get into trying to start
contouring because I've never really
done that before so this was kind of
gonna be my intro to contouring
now this shades let me tell you the
shades are absolutely gorgeous they are
beautiful beautiful shades i swatched
them for you though so this is the this
side right here my left side you can see
the swatches there one two three four
five six okay I just watched these
before I came over to the keep it to the
camera okay and then these over here or
swatched here one two three four five
six okay so you can already see the
problem that they aren't they're very
light light light colors for the
eyeshadows very light the other problem
is I'm going to show you this watch okay
bye-bye eye shadows gone okay
so blend carefully especially with this
side they pretty much disappear when you
blend them which sucks because they're
beautiful when you apply the most of
them this side isn't as bad watch this
one go okay see there's still a little
bit left on those except for the the
very beginning one which is a beautiful
like purpley kind of color the rest
stayed a little better so I use those on
my eyes today I use those on my eyes
today I try to use them some of them as
like a liner didn't really work they're
not really dark enough to be liners so I
mean these shadows on he over here
aren't mad these are nice if you are
going to wear them for about 15 minutes
they're beautiful but then they go away
eventually if you do any kind of swipe
of anything you get in some strong wind
they're gonna be carved which is sad
they show you the swatches for the brow
it blushes contour stuff so you can kind
of see this is one two three four five
six I turn the light down a bit because
you couldn't even see them at all one
two three four five six let's see the
blending of it the only ones that are
left are the blush and the bronzer the
highlighters were gone completely so I'm
very disappointed in those
the blush upside down so this blush kind
of stays on a little bit and the Browns
are a little bit but the rest are gone
completely you can't even see them
they're completely gone let me show you
the lip glosses here the lip glosses one
two three and four I am wearing the
third one I just stuck my finger in this
one real good I'm wearing this one you
tell they're not very pigmented at all
if you only like a time the tiniest bit
of color there they're fine they're good
they're fine this one has no color at
all this one's basically just a straight
gloss with no pigment at all this one's
got a very very little tiny bit of
pinkish pigment this one has again just
a little tiny bit this one's obviously
it's the darkest it's got the most
pigment but it's still very very minimum
and I'm an I'm a minimal lip kind of
girl so these are fine for me I'm sorry
it helps if I hold them up so you can
see them these are fine for me because I
don't really like a lot of pigment but
if you were what you were expecting this
to look like the lipstick more it's not
it doesn't look anything like that so
anyway I think this is a a whole look
exclusive so you probably won't be able
to find this in drugstore anyway but if
you don't know
pixie products if you've never gotten a
pixie product this might be what you're
getting when you buy it they're not
really that expensive yeah believe it
was twenty dollars and this to me
personally is not worth twenty dollars
I'm glad that look paid for this for me
because it came broken I'm very thankful
again broken because I would have been
disappointed if I had paid twenty
dollars for this so hopefully that helps
you thank you so much for watching and I
will see you in my next video which will
hopefully be my August favorites so I
will see
mad love we'll see soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
