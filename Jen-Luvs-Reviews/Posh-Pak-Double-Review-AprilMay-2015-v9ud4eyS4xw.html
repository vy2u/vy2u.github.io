blank I love my friends welcome to posh
Pak times two we have two months of posh
Pak to show you posh Pak is a girl's
subscription for girls ages 5 all the
way through teenage years we get the
five year old 28 year old box sent us
for promotion but that does not
influence our review at all right little
girl ye yes okay are you ready to show
my friends our friends what was in your
April box alright this is in case we
haven't met before that I'm Jen this is
Lila and this is john john wants to sit
with us while we discuss what is in
Lila's box and she's going to tell you
what she thought of everything so what
was our theme this month Lila my theme
was spring into fashion so this is the
first sight amis are called unravels and
they're just like crammed except one
year so when they get low you could
unravel the them and then a message
comes out it's pretty neat see the
flower I tested it on there and what did
you think of it hey it works prick it
works really well awesome so Lila do you
think these are worth six dollars yeah I
think so too I mean there's six crayons
in there they're good size are gonna
last a long time and you get the fun of
unwrapping the secret message which is
really cool so all right moving on to
the next item he's on key quitter
erasers hmmm and what are they there
erasers that have little critters on
them and there are different colors and
they it look like crayons but they're
actually erasers well I tried him out
last month and they work really well
even if you use and really like me nice
so they're effective okay nice and the
retail price on those is four dollars do
you feel like they're worth four dollars
I would say more you think more how much
would you say they're worth Layla for
all these erasers six dollars she soon
for these very nice all right so so far
a good posh Pak mm-hmm
I'm crystal hair flowers ok and the
retail price on those are well do you
want to show them that ok go ahead and
show them this is the thing I got from
from from malayan I very like it
much ok are you go No so these flowers
here they're kind of a cloth here and
there's lots of layers of cloth and then
there's two rhinestones and two little
pearls in the middle of them there the
clip in the back looks like that and do
you feel like these are worth twelve
dollars know what would you guys like
six six fair enough fair enough ok
moving on yeah lace boot cuffs or
legging cups so what do you how do you
use these things so you put them on your
leg who are your arm well you probably
put them on your leg but mom is just
showing on the arm and what do they're
just decorative I guess yeah okay and
how much are they worth well thick would
you pay 1254 these know what would you
pay for them I like pain like five yeah
yeah I feel like these are a weird
inclusion for a young girl I just kind
of feel like they're just pieces of lace
um you ever seen anybody wear cuffs on
their leggings like this like is it a
fashion we're not aware of or something
I don't know I'm just I'm just not
really sure about these just in general
um so I don't know she'll use these but
maybe we can find another use for them
this is a silver heart necklace ok and
I'm gonna go ahead and pull that out and
what do you think about this silver
heart necklace Lila liked it yeah the
retail price is twelve dollars in 1997
how did you think this is worth twelve
dollars and ninety-nine cents no I would
say like maybe like nine so this is the
necklace it's very very pretty it's got
very intricate designs on it there and
it is kind of like a hollow shape this
does not open or anything but I think
it's very very pretty it has a lobster
clasp
in the back and it seems to be very well
made it's just a really nice necklace
and then we have the lollipop mmm and
it's by yummy earth organics and we used
to feed this you when you were tiny you
probably don't even remember getting
those cuz we used to get those for you
when you were really little so what was
your favorite thing inside Lila you Ray
CIL's the erasers and the unravels
mm-hmm and these are really functional
things for you because you're always
drawing and coloring and using pencils
and needing to erase and things like
that so these are very very useful and
they're cute too so very nice are you
right what's what's up with their face
getting a little grumpy but are you
ready to move on to the mailbox yeah it
was fun to make here is the mail on the
theme is May flowers are you want that
first thing we happen here is the
camellia bag and it retails for 1919
okay and it's got a zipper top here and
you open it up and you can just put
little things in here you can put a
little money in there get cards or just
little notes or whatever she wants to
put in and it's got the strap handle
here and this is removable what do you
think about this do you think it's worth
twenty dollars know what do you think
it's worth i would think like eight
dollars eight dollars mm-hmm with you
I'm with you it's cute I think it may be
because it's got that faux leather and
it's kind of intricate the way that it's
designed maybe that's why it has a
little bit more of a price to it but but
it's a very nice little wallet here I
don't want sure if twenty dollars but
it's a nice little quality thing I next
we have the bubble style bracelet okay
let's pull that out so missing you want
to hold it you're already happy there's
the bubble starburst you're gonna put it
on John well it looks so handsome on you
know
does and matches your outfit don't pull
it it matches your outfit look yellow
yellow white white it matches your
outfit look see matches the outfit all
right so while what do you think about
that like it retails for it have you not
a time okay and would you pay 799 for
this yeah why would pay like seven okay
so you feel like it's like just barely
over price yeah the floral headband okay
so this is from an etsy shop and it's
beautiful it's got the the flower
detailing with the little leaves and the
band here but it's not adjustable and
you can see how large this is I think
that this would even be big on me so I
just I just wish that they had made it
adjustable or made it for a child's head
if they're going to include it in the
child's box especially if it's a Nazi
shop because they can probably adjust
that kind of thing it retailed for four
dollars and seventy-five cents okay
would you pay five dollars for this
mm-hmm I think especially if it was the
right size we've tried it on her it does
not fit her I can try it on myself and
it the thing is it's got elastic on the
back so it can stretch but it's even
large on me you can see it sticks out
it's even large on me so this is kind of
a bust in that what we'll have to do is
probably pin it or head back here so it
doesn't mmhmm yeah okay you showing your
shoe that's a nice shoe maybe tonight is
the floral fabric womp and how does that
work does it just tirade your wrist
highs around the wrist so it's so it's
kind of so it's pretty much adjustable
needs are different people okay can I
tie it around you so we can see how it
looks mmm does that feel comfortable
mmhmm yeah very nice it's a little
there's Oh some flowers very very
flowery mm-hmm on the inside you can see
that Prem one thing i don't like about
this for a child is that there's no
numbers on it so it's pretty much
impossible for her breed not impossible
but not very easy to read oh yeah yeah
there's no lines there's no indicator of
the time so it's more of a fashion piece
for her than it
is for actual functional reading of time
because I don't even see any a single
line yeah it's this too difficult for a
young child thank you so it's no sleep
so for me would be like posting for
fashion more than tell Kiki time mm-hmm
that's right yeah I know when I like
when you give me kisses okay so oh how
much would you pay for this Lyla the
retail is 10 ranking ring and I would
probably pay late by is very key doing
tonight yeah just because it's not as
functional yeah and oh yeah because it's
not like super late Colonel cuz cuz
there's no noise at all and there's no
numbers so it's so it's very very hard
to read I this mmhmm yeah okay well
let's go ahead and move on to the next
item it's me hospital nail polish and
what's Lawson okay and it's by laura
ashley and every time is thirteen
dollars okay I wouldn't paper no no well
let me see let me open it up cuz I
didn't test these polishes to seem to
nice polishes we haven't really opened
this one really nice and i like piÃ±a
like what city do you think about a
Polish is gonna be at least five dollars
for an inexpensive power so in this time
with two polishes and a lip gloss so now
if they're good that actually looks very
thick like almost too thick
so John decided that he was not into
filming so he is back entertaining
himself in his room and we're going to
continue with the review of the nail
polish and the lip gloss so while we
were waiting for Johnny gets settled we
painted her nails with the nail polish
and it's it's a very odd polish so if
you look at the Polish it's kind of a
baby blue and then her nail it turned
into like a dark blue and the same thing
happened with the pay look and see how
it's a baby pink and then it turns into
like almost like a corally pink it's
very ah and when it goes on it's not
creamy like this it's almost like a gel
kind of looking finish it's very weird
polish but but do you like it even
though it's weird yeah okay did you want
to try the lip gloss okay I know your
nails are still a little bit wet but
here I'll put on you it's got kind of
like a silvery kind of finish to it mama
mama did you get an offer you more and
then got enough and it's very let me
swatch it on my hand I have another
previous swatch here but i'll show you
okay see how it's like almost metallic e
but then when you rub it in it just
almost looks like a highlighter and then
it just as it dries down the highlight
kind of goes away it's very weird okay
so they said the retail price on this
lie low for the nail polish and lip
gloss was $13 do you feel like the two
nail polishes on the lip gloss together
were thirteen dollars awesome you think
it's about about fair okay awesome and
then there's one more thing in here it
looks like it's a bonus gift it this is
it says prep cosmetics go to beauty
brand exciting educational on the
importance of skincare while providing
opportunities to make positive change
around the world prep your skin dot-com
and it is a face and body lotion is also
sunscreen uh-huh and that of course we
know is very very important so that your
skin doesn't get burned you don't end up
with skin cancer all those things never
too young to start on these skin care so
very excited about that she does have
sensitive skin so we'll have to make
sure we test it on a little part of her
before we put it all over her face we
don't want her to have the reaction so
we
not try that yet but we will so that's
just a bonus gift so in this posh Pak we
got the bag the bubble bracelet the
floral headband that doesn't fit the
watch with no numbers and the weird nail
polish and lip gloss but did you like it
alright awesome which one do you think
you looked better out of April and May
well you think April was better it had
the art supplies in it which i think is
always a a win for you yeah did you have
a favorite thing out of the mailbox that
you liked I really like the bracelet the
bracelet is your favorite awesome yeah
yeah cuz it because it cuz I can wear
with like any outfit mm-hmm especially a
lot of the colors you wear you wear a
