excited Wow okay we are probably more
excited about this box than any box
we've opened recently this is called
posh Pak and who is posh Pak for me for
Lila it's for girls um let me get the
website it says they have three
different options of three different age
groups depending on how old your little
girl is okay so they've got ages 5 to 8
and then 9 to 12 and then 13 and up for
the different options for boxes so oh
and as far as price it is $29 a month
for one month and then six month is 169
and then 12 months is 329 but I'll put
the whole breakdown of everything down
in the description of how much it costs
per month of for the different options
I also I'll let you know whether that
includes shipping or not now Lila is way
too excited for us to not continue so
let's go ahead and open up and find out
what's in her posh pack this is what it
looks like on the outside hold on that's
how it looks on the inside and she's
gonna rip it open rip open that cute
paper okay and just like other boxes
there's a card inside and all the
products are on the back it looks like
she got one two three four five six
seven eight different products in her
posh pack this month it says it's red
carpet time we hope you enjoy your
star-studded posh posh pop we filled it
with our favourite must-haves a little
glitter and a lot of sparkle this August
August pack is on its way to Hollywood
to be featured in a celebrity
gift-giving suite at the 2014 primetime
and the awards show this is huge this is
great and it's the very very first posh
pack so let's go ahead go ahead and pull
something out and see what you see Oh
what is it Lila it's a lollipop
it's a star-shaped lollipop bye twinkle
candy yay so that's cool yums let's say
this is blam tastic luscious lip balm
for girls in a clip and go sleeve so
it's got a little sleeve there and she
can clip it on to like her shorts and
she'll have her lip balm with her that's
really cute and it's strong
very shake blam it's got SPF 15 its pret
related it's packed
mm-hmm its petroleum free and paraben
free which is awesome because a lot of
the stuff that is for little kids is not
not so good it's got a lot of that stuff
in it so that's very exciting all right
next thing Lila it's a sticker and it
says get your blame on WWMT ENCOM that's
cute
hey looks like a headband and adjust the
business adjustable I don't know we just
got off the kayaks that's where we're
all like scrub early ee alright and this
one should fit you if it doesn't Mama's
steel in it it doesn't fit you but it
should fit you

band oh I think I've seen these before
and it's got a $20 price tag on the back
and says have fun okay aha we'll have to
see tutorials on YouTube of how to use
this thing it's a twist scarf with a
quick twist this weird scarf can be worn
tied in a bow wrapped in a rosette in
your hair or around your neck or as a
bracelet interesting as seen on Katy
Perry Taylor Swift and Nina Dobrev seen
in Justine and in style magazines and
then their website has a how-to video on
how to put it on pretty neat I would
love to see I think while is gonna be
more excited what she sees it on someone
