posh pack unboxing posh back is a girl's
subscription it is twenty nine dollars a
month and it's less if you get more
boxes so there's a deal if you get six
months and yell if you get 12 months so
LYLAS be getting posh Pak for quite a
while now what is your general opinion
of posh back I see you really like it
why do you like posh back there's just a
lot of fun and paintings ended yeah have
you ever got a posh Pak that you didn't
like you and she's honest just like her
mama so we do receive this as a
promotional box but that does not
influence our review of the girl could
care less whether I get this for
promotion or not she just cares what's
in the box so speaking of that it can
that's right so speaking of that lets
see what is in the January box while is
going to kind of run the show from here
on in so the theme is 2015 a bright new
year first is the knit the knitted
braided headband ear warmer bye-bye
three bird nests it retails $16 so nice
way to keep the ears warm and be
fashionable at the same time you can let
the hair peek out or leave it so that
the hair doesn't peak out what do you
think of that cool yeah you like it next
is the food sit sack I live in the
retails for twenty-two ninety-five okay
so I have a lot of my fourth graders I
teach fourth grade and I have a lot of
them using these bags right now to put
their stuff in it's just a kind of like
a backpack but it's a cinch sack and you
carry it on your back and they like
these because they can't put them on the
backs of their chairs or not like
straight up backpack so they can like
keep them with them and keep their stuff
in them and the pattern is so cute what
do you think of this I think why do you
like it it's just a lot of great colors
on it and then like the colors and I
like it because I can make Fillmore's
I don't get like a lot of stuff in it
mm-hmm so definite went on this one
mm-hmm do you think that this is worth
twenty three dollars yeah I don't think
so i agree Lila how much would you pay
for this like 10 nose and 50 cent yeah i
agree i'm totally with you i'm totally
on the same wavelength same wavelength i
was thinking about ten dollars or so i
pay for this I think $23 is a little bit
overpriced but it is very very cute and
it will definitely be used and I do feel
like though I didn't mention that I do
you feel like this is worth 16 no
Kendall 10 again yeah I mean I can see
this being sold at like Claire's or
something for sixteen dollars but you
know at target you probably find it
closer to 10 it really I mean it does
seem like very nice quality it's it's a
knitted knitted hair head warmer ear
warmer thingy it's nice yeah okay all
right let's move on x is bright and
colorful flap watch mmm what do you
think about this one this is i think is
their favorite thing in the box right
kind of well yeah there's something else
in here she really loves but this is
really cool so it keeps pretty good time
and it's a slap watch and if you're my
age you remember slap bracelets you want
to show him how it works all right yeah
and i love that because it fits to any
childs wrist a lot of stuff that she
gets sometimes is meant for bigger kids
her wrists are very very tiny but this
will fit her and it's also cool because
if you need to wash the band then the
actual clock part pops out and then this
is just the silicone so so big win on
this what's the retail price on this
kiddo 899 would you pay 99 fost watch
yes I would too we're like we're like in
sync today me and you I would totally I
totally think this is worth a 99 I can
see this being sold for even a little
bit more but definitely a nine I think
is it definitely a fair price for this
lyrics yes them in body gudalur crayons
is that your favorite thing in the box
and the two of these
kind of my favorites okay and tell us
about the body jeweler crayons one of
the main are basically crayons that you
can draw on your selfless and you
brought those over to your friend's
house right and y'all drew all over each
other yes fisherlady mojo or if he's
like me but like for like Fred crying
all over her face with the little dots
and antennas on and you drew want her
little sisters too didn't you yeah yeah
how fun I did let the mom know that she
brought these and the mom was okay with
it so for the record but these are fun
let's show them how they work yeah you
want to swatch them okay she wants she
sees mommy swatch so she's gonna swatch
duh and they wash off their yearly kill
yes that's a good thing that they don't
stain well so this one right here is the
red one is the yellow this is the crane
blue white in the black even the even
the white shows up really good the white
even shows up really good yeah which is
surprising ya later skin the waitress up
pretty good and I found darker skin the
black will probably show up pretty good
mmhmm yeah now it doesn't say on here
the ingredients but the website i will
put a link down below it's int LA or our
IV ALS pants lera volts.com in case
you're interested in these i will put
the link down below to this company but
really what i love about them is how
fast they wash off unlike regular
markers and a lot of kid art things they
typically it says washable but
girlfriend you know it ain't washing off
anytime soon so I really like that about
these and then what's the retail price
on these sweetheart Ethan your v-tail
for nine dollars and ninety-five cents
would you pay 995 for them why you pay
more for them I think 995 is fair um
just because of the quality of them i
would pay what make twelve dollars and
ninety-nine cents you would so it's
almost thirteen dollars you would pay
for those yeah they are productive out
there key yeah sounds good all right
what do we have next sweetheart I think
it's the last official thing in the book
here called bright hair ties
i Sparkle boutique retails for 699 and
they're just the hair ties that don't
leave a mark in your hair she tried them
yet though mm-hmm no but I've tried I've
used these before and I think you've
used these before haven't you like that
style yeah yeah they're all kind of this
let's hold them up so they can see
they're all kind of the same but what I
like about these is all the different
colors that there are and then she's
really big I don't know if your
daughters or little girls in your life
or like this but she has to match
everything so this gives us lots of
options for matching I love that you can
bring these will be able to bring these
into different seasons as well not just
for winter I me a couple of them you can
wear in winter but then we can bring
them into other seasons too so spring
yeah birthdays I know you're gonna be 70
this is the five to eight year old box i
believe yes yeah it goes all the way up
to teenagers but i don't see a whole lot
of variation in the boxes but you can
look up different boxes box openings for
other age ranges as well so 699 i think
that's pretty much what these things
cost worms down worms down um it's okay
we'll clean them up let's let's clean up
the worms watching no only the worms or
a minute let's leave the worms and let's
just talk about the last thing the bonus
which is always a lollipop mm-hmm and in
sometimes a stickers are magnets but
this time we just got a lollipop that's
true and they used to give like the
little clearer ones it seems like
they're lollipop quality has been going
up oh no you gotta go like this we can't
see our faces now they can save one
right here so everything kind of fits in
with it yeah that's true you know I
hadn't even thought about that it's
bright new year and everything is a
bright colored theme it's play the
lollipop is only mode watches remove the
bag
all these bright colors oh right potty
so Lila how do you feel about this
overall awesome awesome do you think
this compares to your other posh packs
you better about the same not as good
nothing is seen about the same way
you're generally happy with your posh
back so I think part of what makes it
nice too is it's like getting a present
every month so she gets really really
excited to open it and i think that's
that's part of it about it's like your
birthdays every single month yeah I
getting like a little present and we did
order a citrus lane for John I don't
know if we're gonna film it or not if
you'd be interested in the citrus lane
