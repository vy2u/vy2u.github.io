hello my friends welcome to a very late
but very awesome posh Pak review /
unboxing but it's mostly a review
because we've already unboxed it and
we've had this thing forever right yeah
we got this back in June before we moved
and yes in June and then we promptly
lost it after we had tried some of the
products and did not find it again until
after we had begun unpacking so this is
an extremely late posh Pak this is the
June box but this is really really
important because there's going to be a
giveaway of this exact box coming up at
the end of this video I will tell you
how to enter the giveaway so are you
ready to tell everybody what's in the
posh back but they'll be winning mmm
fantastic now you may notice that LYLAS
hair is unbrushed but that is on purpose
because we're gonna show you one of the
products that she got see you don't know
what you want to say I'm gonna stuff
them yes first what is this a card and
what's the purpose of this card good
know what what the different products
are called them what their places are
all right so what is this John what is
this it's a blast lat already died
uh-huh it's a brush will be been using
it for a while mm-hmm did we use this on
your hair John no he hears it on this
ever here we did but if he doesn't
really need it this is the knot genie
detangling brush and we have been using
this thing like crazy while awaiting
this well until we lost it but then we
found it again well what do you think of
this brush awesome why because it pulls
out your knots faster and doesn't pull
as hard on your hair so we're gonna do a
little demonstration on how to brush
Lila's hair and also Oliveri okay so I'm
gonna put this thing in her hair pretty
hard see I'm like pulling her head in
her hair she's been playing outside yes
it's a cool hurts a teeny bit i'm like
yanking on her head like no joke pulling
and you can see how quickly it just gets
really really pretty i was getting a
little bit bored so he had to go and do
something
cuz he was just getting bored so he's in
the other room playing with toys and you
see how she's not yelling at me to stop
mommy that hurts like I'm not I'm being
rough on her see how beautiful it makes
your hair and I promise not Jeannie is
not paying me for this video we just
really really like this brush she went
over to her grandmother's house and her
grandmother said that she could totally
tell a difference when she used this
brush versus other brushes that are made
her hair look really silky so I mean you
can see how fast that was an easy that
was to brush the side of her hair and
she loves it because it doesn't pull and
we getting Gus and he gets that a lot
faster yeah it does get faster every
would Fournier if her hair is super
naughty I find that it doesn't work as
well as if it's just regular naughty
super naughty we need to use a different
brush because these bends and I don't
think it can handle super not but not
like this it works very well yeah
alright already all right it's already
all brush this brush for the same
purpose from Birchbox some from the
birch bark shop and this is the no
tangle by macadamia hair this one does
not work nearly as well as the knot
genie I don't know what it is about the
the bristles but this one definitely
there's a huge difference so I mean
really and truly without my influence do
you think this is worth twenty bucks
yeah cool colors foreign one magnetic
bracelet cool and what do you think
about this I like why do you like it cuz
it as a bunch of pretty colors on mm-hmm
I can you show how it works just gonna
be folded uh-huh and then you pull it
right hey it's okay do you want me to do
it mm-hmm okay so it's a very strong
magnet so you fold it a little bit and
then just pull it apart it's got like
almost like puzzle pieces okay so it's
really cute I mean you can wear it
casual you can wear it a little bit
rusty I guess with the with the bling
there but I mean it's just a really cute
bracelet and is it comfortable to wear
mm-hmm okay fantastic ah wonderful and
it doesn't slip off when you wear it
right but i can see that also being able
to fit someone with slightly larger
wrists as well and what's the retail
price on that item Lyla $13 fantastic
alright what's next whoo remember this
is june so it's beginning of summer I
let's see horseback by the Sun well and
it's remember this was beginning a
summer so it's got the cute little
seahorses on there and it's actually a
pretty spacious bag um unzip it and kind
of show you the inside its got a
plasticky kind of inside and we think
about this kid okay yeah what do you
think you'll use the store any idea mmm
you don't use it yet maybe you'll like
maybe if I late I run out of space and
my bag and I could put some of my stuff
in there mm-hmm that's not a good place
the small stuff in there yeah you know
what this I'd be good for socks yup you
can put socks in there um or you can put
let your toothbrush and your toiletries
and things in here this might be a nice
bag for that all right good foot like my
makeup in yeah and just like mommy right
very nice okay would you let's talk
about next my loaf it's a face cleansing
lotion is called work in progress by
fashion eagle and we have not used this
on her face um she's very sensitive skin
so I get nervous about using this on her
face like try it like out unlike my tiny
patch on my kike we could we could if we
want to but I'm scared you want to smell
it though it smells pretty good it says
there's Santoni pink grapefruit this is
a smell like pink grapefruit Hey yeah it
smells pretty good right mm-hmm it
reminds me of the 80s like these colors
eighties ladies does this look like the
80s geo totally looks like 80 to me like
like maybe Debbie Gibson what a promoted
this like it's just very 80s so we
haven't tried this yet so we can't speak
to it but its a giant bottle of
cleansing lotion the ricoh price is ten
dollars ten dollars Wow okay well there
you go you think this is worth ten bucks
maybe maybe it works well if it works
it'll works well would be like all right
they doesn't work well what is right
there you go that's a really good point
how much for the bracelet what would you
was what was the retail price the
bracelet it was gay Derek teen gallery
hmm you think this is where $13 what
would you pay for this okay
and yeah so slightly overpriced and then
what was the retail price on this yeah
114 dollars and ninety and ninety-five
cents what do you think about that 12 so
again slightly overpriced so so far
we're it slightly overpriced for each
item so let's see as we keep going
alright what's next getaway to grow
shampoo and conditioner by not your
mother's is that funny in a way not your
mother's now this is just straight-up we
lost the box so we didn't get a chance
to use this and I feel really bad that
we get a chance to you this but if we
use it before the this video goes live
we will put LYLAS opinion of it down in
the description below which we will try
to use this before this video goes live
these are just sample size conditioner
and shampoo there one ounce each and
what does it say the retail prices says
there are three dollars each for the
small one so what do you think about
that okay yeah yeah okay buried them and
let's just for furnace a fuller maybe
four maybe even a little more let's
smell does it snow goods that's
important is shampoo anything it smells
good it smells kind of fruity it reminds
me of like God you know like a typical
drug store or shampoo yummy smell kind
of thing going on there is the gold
starfish ponytail holder so there is
what that looks like a close what's the
resale price on this baby six dollars 50
cent do you think this is worth six
dollars and fifty cents yeah she's
looking like now and I agree with her I
don't know where they got six dollars
and fifty cents on this one what would
you pay for it golly yeah I'm totally
with you you are really good at this kid
I mean it is nice and it's on there very
well if you see here like it's it's
really on there very nicely so I don't
see this breaking off anytime soon even
though you know you're gonna be twisting
and tugging on this I don't see this
breaking off so um but still yeah I
think it's a little overpriced layup lip
gloss style ad by fashion angels haha
light up lip gloss watch out Gerard
cosmetics you've got some competition
it's got a little switch
get that and it's multi-colored mm-hmm
are you think about this I kinda doubt
it look now let's put out to me put on
you mmmmmm and I like it because it's
not super opaque I mean it adds a little
tiny bit of a tense but nothing that
anybody would notice oh my mom how's it
feel it feels really susie's does it
feel sticky at all mm mm-hmm it doesn't
feel sticky and it doesn't smell bad
smells like grapes to me the small
grapes to you mm-hmm and it also like
lights up here and when you flip the
switch up it turns off when you put it
down it turns on nice and what's the
retail price on the sweetheart eight
dollars hey Josh what do you thing about
the press eight dollars of us okay don't
eight dollars even maybe seven dollars
and fifty cents yeah but yeah I mean if
it's a novelty thing and it's cute and
it's it's you know perfect for a
teenager or a little girl you know all
these colors and everything burn alert
wristbands by sunburn alert mm-hmm and
what's the retail price on these two
dollars two dollars uh and yes I used
one and then you put it back yeah cool
okay so which one did you use well did
it work because I wasn't a part of it I
don't say it work okay so the concept
behind this it says before putting on
the band you apply sunscreen to the skin
following exact directions on the
sunscreen label then you put the band on
the wrist you activate the band by
exposing it to direct sunlight and the
band will turn a dark color in three
minutes then you apply a sunscreen to
the band and allow 15 minutes for the
sunscreen to dry before letting the band
get wet and then when the band turns to
a lighter color like oh it's like a
light purple color that's your reminder
to reapply the sunscreen
the water and not the beach yes about
time I wore it yes it turned on it
turned the light purple says when when
it turns the baiji kind of color you
reach your match maximum sun exposure
for the day so it's just a really nice
little alone room of four kids and
parents about sun exposure and you know
we all need to be very aware of that so
this is a really neat little product and
then what what would you think as far as
paying two dollars for these you think
that's fair yeah yeah okay sounds good
so this is a win for you it worked well
all right r and then the last thing away
lollipop that we filmed the video she
can actually eat it I won't let her eat
it until we film the video and that is a
Jupiter chuckle Chuck jumping chops you
guys ever have these when you were a kid
I know I had these when I was a kid that
choppa chups I think that's what they're
called I don't know I just remember
eating them i don't remember trying to
pronounce them so get the cat chopper
chaves you want try it now no when i try
to read chocolate shops yeah there's
chocolate cups mm-hmm also I'm not sure
if this is still available because this

dollars at style lab girl calm using
code jun 20 a check out and that's the
fashion angels which is the magnetic
