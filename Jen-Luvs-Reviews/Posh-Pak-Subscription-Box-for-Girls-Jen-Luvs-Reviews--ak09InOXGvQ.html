pack unboxing now this is actually the
februari box things got a little crazy
and februari and I didn't get to film a
lot of the videos that I wanted to patch
pack is what do we say twenty nine
dollars a month yeah twenty nine dollars
a month and then you get a break if you
get more months so Lila do you like posh
back yes it do you look forward to it
every month yeah yes yes and she we
haven't got the shipping confirmation
she the chance we might not get the
March one because we do get this as a
promotional subscription but that does
not influence our review because Lila
doesn't care whether I get it for promo
or whether I paid for it she doesn't
care all she cares about is what's in
the box right alright sweet right let's
go ahead and open this up and go ahead
and take out the card first okay and
what was the theme this month
valentine's Day mmm-hmm very nice
writeup card what is that this is a pink
polka dot infinity scarf by viv and Lou
the retail price is twenty dollars
mm-hmm and ninety-five cents so
basically $21 and what do you think
about that anything y que cosa it is
very soft you've worn that a lot since
you got it haven't you I'm surprised now
yell over dirty I am lost it was you did
he freaked out we went to panera bread
and she thought she left it in panera
and she was really upset about I just
watch you didn't bring it in but when we
were right so thankfully we didn't lose
it so there we go very nice um do you
feel like this is worth $21 what do you
think it's worth I agree I agree i'm
with you about ten dollars ten to twelve
dollars the most i do feel like it's a
bit of a price but it is a very nice
scarf okay let's move it on local
bracelet and though quote velcro charms
by squirrels retail the local bracelet
retails for two dollars and ninety-five
cents in the velcro triumph retail or
six dollars and ninety-five cents aha so
what's the idea behind these how do they
work so these are velcro bracelets and
these have milkers on
okay so with these there's you can take
the bracelets off and they undo and then
you can put the charms you can stick fit
so they're both velcro you're gonna
stick the charms on to the bracelet and
you don't and it doesn't come with the
charms permanently on there so you can
split them out any time you want and
what are your thoughts about these need
you like them yeah mm-hmm I personally I
don't know I mean it's a piece of velcro
with these the charms that have a piece
of velcro on the back I I feel like I
mean if they catch on as a trend i think
that the kids will really like them but
i mean really it's just a strip of
velcro um that's colored and i give them
credit and props for coming up with this
idea and i do hope for them that it does
take off but i think it's a little bit i
don't know it's just a piece of velcro
so I'm not that impressed with this
personally but I can see where kids
would really really like it and it's not
for me it's for kids so there you go hey
Valentine's men x cento and it retails
for 200 I'm so three dollars and the
scent is passion fruit mmm can I smell
it and it writes in pink glitter gel oh
my goodness that smells really good all
right it's Hmong box box yeah it smells
in the box um yeah it's got a pink pink
ink and it is a little bit glittery a
little bit of silver glitter in there
that's really cool and how much was this
now the three doll totally worth three
dollars in my opinion yeah I would say
like five dollars you pay five dollars
for this very cool awesome these are a
sort of valentine Valentine's hair
flowers by Sparkle boutique retails for
1250 mm-hmm so their hair clips and you
can see the back the way that those
clip-on and I think it goes like that
but that's okay and they just start just
basic hair clips they look almost like
an Etsy and put one on
how does it look good should we put one
on you yeah which color is the light
pink one you a phone si si mamacita can
we get away with this we should we wear
these with us the video should we take
it out that's I want to change my color
to the night you oh you want to match so
these are retailed for 1250 do you think
there were 12 50 I'll see you like a
little bit less okay no like ten dollars
I'm with you I'm with you kiddo and I
also feel like these would be better for
a younger kid I think while is kind of
the top of the age range for these but I
think while it can still rock them at
six years old but I think if she was
like eight or nine these would be a
little bit young but this is the five to
eight year old box so this is kind of
reaching for that but I do think it
looks cute on her looks super cute but I
mostly see things like this on younger
kids but but they're still cute
conversation heart nail tattoos and
heart file my lucky star style retails
for 250 okay I'm to 15 2015 cents okay
let me I just want to bring these up
close so you can see these look how cute
these are ok so those are the nail
stickers i know my nails need to be done
but those are the nail stickers their
little conversation hearts and these are
actually tattoo design they're not like
stickers so you put them on the same way
you put on a temporary tattoo and they
are super cute we should totally put
those on your nails totally and then the
nail file is heart-shaped unless sure if
you can see that through the bag but its
heart shaped alright you think that's
worth you dogs in fifteen cents I would
say like three dollars and eighty cents
okay so you would pay from war Feliz
yeah very cool very cool is a silver
heart necklace by baby bug loft retails
for twelve dollars okay so I'm gonna go
ahead take this out to this cute little
bag they sent it in it's adorable and
I'll bring this up so you can see has a
worksheet and on the bottom okay so
there's the heart charm just super cute
and trying to find a nail but doesn't
look destroyed but there's the little
heart charm that dangles and it's got a
lobster claw clasp their fits this is a
good size for her so that makes me happy
see that it's a good size um what do you
think about the retail price for this do
you think it's worth that twelve dollars
oh yeah I'm with you kiddo we are on the
same page with job I am standing on the
last ipad 2 I know you're getting good
at this kiddo or we're just both growing
in the wrong direction together however
you want to look at it I feel like we're
doing pretty good yeah so um so overall
how happy are you with the februari posh
back I'm takie pretty happy you have a
preference of something that your
favorite not really personal yeah
personally I like the cement a lot i
think the cement super cool i like the
tide nail touches you know it's hard the
damn good yep and the tattoos i like the
necklace the necklace was pretty nice um
but it's nothing that's like blowing me
away and the hair bows they're cute this
I wasn't super impressed with especially
for the price but I think it was a good
posh bag I don't think it's been your
favorite one of all yeah but oh and then
the score if you really love the scarf I
forgot about the scarf yeah you love do
you think this was your favorite the
scarf or no time it's time to clean
those two between this and the tattoos
