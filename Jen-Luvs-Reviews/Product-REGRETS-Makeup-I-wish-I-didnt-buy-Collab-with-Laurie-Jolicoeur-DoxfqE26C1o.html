that may be a little controversial let's
start off with a lot of controversy
let's just go for the jugular right now
hello my friends welcome to my video on
products I regret buying I you know I
bought a lot of products girlfriend of
what friend I buy lots and lots of
products but sometimes doesn't quite
work out the way I expected it to so
I've got a whole table full of stuff
that I purchased with my dollars that I
don't like
there is one thing here that was said to
me sort of kind of I'll explain that one
in a bit but everything except for one
thing on this table are things that I
purchased we're gonna get into that in a
second but first I want to introduce the
person that I am collaborating on this
video with her name is Laurie Jolicoeur
she is fantastic we've been kind of
growing our channels together we've been
subscribed to each other for a really
long time she is such a sweetheart
and oh my goodness she has a wonderful
channel just very informative very
knowledgeable straight to the point you
know great quality videos I mean really
truly I really think you're gonna enjoy
her if you've never met Laurie before
I'm gonna put her cute little picture up
there she's just so stinking cute and
amazing so I will put a link to Laurie's
video down below so you can check it out
if you want to see some more products
you should definitely not buy according
to us so let's go ahead and get started
with a well there's quite a few things
in here that may be a little
controversial let's start off with a lot
of controversy let's just go for the
jugular right now
I really regret buying these morphe
eyeshadow palettes and I know that that
is going to cause a little bit of an
uproar these were in my one of my
favorites and fails videos and I think
they were like number nine yeah I don't
like these palettes and it's not because
they're bad palettes because they're not
bad pals there's definitely a market for
palettes like this if you're looking for
a palette that's not super expensive
that'll give you a decent look and you
don't care about it lasting a really
long time
these pallets are fine this is one that
I built myself because I had heard that
if you build one yourself that the
quality is a bit different I did not
find that to be true at least for the
shades that I picked I did find that the
shimmery shades were a little bit more
workable then in the matte shades and I
did purchase a lot more matte shades
than shimmer shades which I'm kind of
sad about I don't know what I was
thinking in this color combination the
big thing that I don't like about these
shadows is that they do not last all day
for me I've tried them with many
different primers and they just don't
last all day for me and for something
that's so hyped up on YouTube as being
the ultimate and amazing and just as
good as high-end no not so much not so
much there I do like this one comes with
a mirror which is pretty cool this one
does not come with a mirror this is the
35n palette and it's just it's just an
OK palette I mean it's definitely not
bad don't get me wrong it's not bad it's
just ok for all the hype these get
that's what gets me for all the hype
these get they just I regret buying them
I I don't reach for them I don't enjoy
using them it's just not they're not fun
to use for me some palettes you know
when you get a really good eye shadow
pout and you're like yes this is really
fun you know because it makes your look
just comes together you know not so much
with these alright moving on to the next
one is from a brand that I absolutely
love from colour-pop now I love color
pop I'm not affiliated with morphe or
color pop in any way they I don't even
think they know I exist so these were
not sent to me just like the morphe
palette were not sent to me these are
color pop eyeliners and it's not that
they're bad Islanders they're actually
very nice eyeliners I love the way they
go on they're beautiful my problem is is
that I think it's just a personal
preference thing a personal choice thing
I don't really feel like I'm gravitating
toward the colors I just don't use them
as much as I should considering how many
I bought I did try to use this one in
dirty talk as a Oliver eyeshadow base it
did not work well it creased up on me I
also found that these kind of flake off
if you rub your eyes like if you make a
wing and you rub your eyes they kind of
flake off and
just not my favorites just so you know I
did get the shades timber which is a
gray and then this one is called work
out which is a green this one is called
dirty talk which is the gold bee sting
is the bright blue and then no shame is
the deep purple and I think it's also
because they're in pots which is another
step to get a brush and then apply them
or whatever and I just kind of like now
this is one that I feel absolutely duped
kind of like the morphe eyeshadow post
no one told me those color pop eyeliners
were good but I did hear that these
Milani lip glosses were good so I bought
a lot of them I got five of them online
and they dry my lips out sold bad when I
talked about them in chat I posed a
question they said are these really bad
or is it just me and everybody's like
not girlfriend they're really bad pump
like oh man oh well so I did get the
shades precious allure Fling loved and
adorable I've worn adorable the most one
thing that I do feel like makes these
workable is if I put a lip balm over top
I can wear them but they just they're so
incredibly dry so overall I mean they're
just a huge fail and I spent a lot of
money on them and it's like no but at
least I got to review them for you so
that I don't regret that I get to review
them for you but I do forget purchasing
them another drugstore product that I
totally regretted buying it's like the
first time put it on I was like no why
did I spend $10 on this this is the
covergirl plumpify blast Pro mascara
that red one oh my goodness so pretty so
pretty
such a bad mascara it's so bad it's so
bad it does absolutely nothing and I
would be shocked if this works for
anybody and it's like your covergirl man
how long you in make it mascara you
can't you can't release something like
this and expect people to take you
seriously like this is terrible like I
don't I don't get it I don't get it
it's just bad all around the wand is
extremely pokey it's extremely large
it's just not a good mascara and I've
talked about this one before too and a
favorites and fails but I just have to
mention it again before I throw it in
the trash all right the next one is one
I don't think I've talked about much
this is the Maybelline brow drama this
is getting a lot of hype when there were
like the
benefit brow whatever gel stuff what is
it called this was getting a lot of hype
when the benefit gimme brow came out but
I definitely don't think this is as good
as the Gimme brow I don't feel like it
blends into my into my brows as well but
the big fail with with the brow drama is
this goofy wand like what what is that
like how in the world is that gonna be
functional and the big problem is is
that when you use this there's no way to
avoid getting it on your skin unless you
have ginormous brows did they measure it
against the person's brows before they
made so many of these things I don't
know I don't think that it's logical it
just makes absolutely no sense so this
is a big note for me did not enjoy it
another product that is similar in brand
to Morpheus Coastal Scents there there's
different drama about where these
products come from and what they're all
made in China or whatever they're all
really the same company just repackaged
with different names I don't know all I
know is it overall I really like Coastal
Scents products I absolutely love their
eyeshadow primer their face primer is
really nice I like their eyeshadows a
lot are they the best eyeshadows ever
now but they're really good I like a
better than the morphe and I can tell
you this is probably one of the most
pigmented blushes I've ever seen in my
entire life but pigmented for blush is
not necessarily a good thing because
pigmented for a blush means clown face
and we don't want a clown face
clown face is not attractive clown
contouring okay I know that was a thing
but the whole idea is that supposed to
blend into your skin eventually to give
you this beautiful look this just
doesn't blend it just doesn't blend it
just it's unless you use like a very
extremely fluffy brush this is really
hard to work with because it's just so
stinking pigmented so this was
definitely uh no for me not because it
has no color but it has way too much
color
furro blush we're gonna kick it with one
more drugstore product this is the
Physicians Formula mineral we're talk
free a beast what let me do that again
this is the mineral where it's helped
free all-in-one ABC cushion foundation
SPF 50 broad-spectrum sunscreen
light/medium
I need to breathe because I have the
longest names Physicians Formula don't
they just absolutely insane and look how
gorgeous this packaging is it is so
stinking cute this is one of those
cushion foundations that they took off
of the Korean beauty market the cushion
foundations you can have as much product
it's twice the price as a typical
foundation and it when I first got it I
kind of liked it in that it lasted a
really long time my big problem with it
is that it sets on sits on top of the
skin rather than blending into the skin
and I just don't like the finish of it
when it comes down to it and I've tried
this also not only with the sponge that
comes with it but I've also used it with
my Real Techniques sponge and also with
my brand new beauty junkie sponge and I
just don't care for it
it just doesn't look nice on my skin I
will say it lasts longer than the
L'Oreal one so if you like if you want
it if you want to try it feel free but I
just feel like it's just super
overpriced for what it is and just a
regular foundation I feel like applies
much better than this and it's just not
worth it then you're paying for the
packaging is what it comes down to and
it is beautiful so if you want to use it
as a display piece go for it but I just
formula wise just wasn't good for me and
the last product is another product that
I've mentioned in the past this is the
Too Faced melted chocolate liquefied
metallic lipstick in chocolate diamonds
I actually really like the melted
chocolate lips lip whatever melted
lipsticks from Too Faced overall I
really like the chocolate ones the
original ones were a little flaky a
little weird but I really like chocolate
ones except for this one and the big
reason why I don't like this one is
because all of the glitter that it
leaves behind on your lips because
eventually the color wears off and when
it does all you're left is with silver
glitter all over your lips and it looks
terrible and he try to wipe it off ends
up all over your face and it's just it's
just not good it's just not good this
Coastal Scents blush is the one that I
was talking about that was kind of sent
to me in that I did a review for Coastal
Scents and they gave me a gift card to
purchase things on their website and
this was one of the things I purchased
with the gift card from the review that
I did I always like to be transparent
about what's what I pay for and what I
didn't pay for that's it for my products
