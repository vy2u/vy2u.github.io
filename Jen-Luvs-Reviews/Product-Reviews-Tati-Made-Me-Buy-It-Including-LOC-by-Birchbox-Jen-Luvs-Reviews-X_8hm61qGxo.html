buy it now there's a little bit of a
backstory to this video if you don't
already know Tati Westbrook on YouTube
also known as glam Life guru is having a
little bit of a contest sorta Tati is
going to pick one lucky person for now
there probably will be other people in
the future to fly out to California to
film with her and hang out with her and
do collaborations together and things
like that and I really really want to do
that I think that would be amazing
I've been subscribed to Tottie's channel
forever and there are quite a few things
that Tati has made me buy and I'm going
to be reviewing those for you today but
before we do that I just want to do a
little introduction to my channel in
case Tati watches this which I'm hoping
that she will
hello Tati it is very nice to officially
meet you through a camera lens my name
is Jan I have a channel called jealous
reviews we do a lot of really fun things
here and do a lot of reviews on
different new products that come out I
do subscription box reviews things like
that I also have a weekly news show
called what's up and make up I have a
crew of reporters that are always on the
lookout for new products that are coming
out and we do a weekly news show and
it's a lot of fun along with that I do
have an app it is for Apple or Android
products and it's basically what I like
to call it it's kind of like Instagram
for nice people it's just like Instagram
except for it's a very safe community
atmosphere it's a very small community
it's people just putting up their lips
getting advice some up from others doing
product reviews subscription box
openings things like that and sharing
our families sharing our lives and it's
just a really wonderful place I also
have a quite a wonderful group of people
on periscope if you're not I don't think
you're on periscope yet but if you are
not on periscope you need to get on
periscope it is a wonderful way to
connect with people I do getting ready
with me five days a week as I'm getting
ready for work in the morning I also
cook dinner with my peril of four nights
a week typically four nights a week and
we just have great conversation then
they helped me and they actually helped
me put this look together today for you
I shout out to the parallel shout-out to
everybody on the width up and makeup app
and everybody on the whatsapp at makeup
comm which is our website Tabitha be a
good friend of mine runs my website for
me and she puts up all of the products
there on the what's the makeup show she
puts them on the website for me we have
a wonderful calendar run by iron a
Nicole on YouTube she's the one who
takes care of our calendar make sure all
the release dates are up to date things
like that on there we also have a forum
on there for people to share their
makeup ideas and expertise my my idea of
building community on YouTube and really
becoming my catchphrases the collective
brain of makeup awesomeness where we all
help each other to spend less money on
things that are terrible and spend
joyful money on things that are awesome
so speaking of that that's a great segue
into me showing you the things that you
made me buy Tati and everybody else
showing you the things that taht he made
me buy to see whether she did a good job
recommending these products or not
because girlfriend you know I'm gonna be
honest because I always the first thing
I want to show you is this japonesque
brush this is like an angled we used it
for contouring and I saw and I was like
ooh I wanted a good contour brush
because this thing is cool-looking now
this thing is honestly it's really
really good I really like I use it for
contouring today with my Kevyn Aucoin
contour book really really liked it a
lot it's perfect for adding that sculpt
they are very very soft the taper goes
down quite a bit so it does pick up a
lot of product but not so much that you
end up with clown face but it really
does shape the cheekbones very nicely
I've also used this for blush I use it
for a little bit of blush today I use a
very very light dusting of blush and it
works for that as well it's just fun to
have that contour shape and I hold it
way down low and it just feels nice to
use I really enjoy this brush a lot the
next thing that Todd's he made me buy it
was the Urban Decay vice palette now she
got this as a promotional palette from
Urban Decay she tried it on for one day
she did that whole wear test thing that
she does if you don't know takis channel
and you're not subscribed you need to go
over there and check it out and see if
she's a channel that you would enjoy
because I personally love her channel
but anyway she does these like
long all-day product reviews which are
really really helpful because she'll put
on the product on camera then she'll
wear the product through the day and
you'll see how it's wearing you'll see
what she's doing through her day and
then she'll show you at night how at war
now this were very very well on her and
I was very excited about it so I bought
it and I can say that the wear time on
these shadows is overall very very good
my only issue with the vice four is that
there can be a lot of glitter on your
face
for some of the shades for example this
one right here Arctic this one right
here and that is a typical Urban Decay
glitter shadow that leaves glitter all
over your face but like this one here
like I've got this one is in robbery
this one is a very metallic sheen
pennilyn does not leave fallout this one
here is called fastball this one is
absolutely gorgeous so there are some
really beautiful workable shades in here
the only other complaint about have
about this is it's kind of a I call it a
supplemental palette in that I feel like
it's hard to get a complete look out of
this palette for me because of the
choices that I choose to use I like to
use a champagne on my lid I like to use
a neutral crease color and then I like
to add a lot to that so if there's no
champagne color that I like if there's
no you know good neutral like taupey
color then I feel like it's not really a
complete palette to use on its own
that's me personally so this really
doesn't do that for me the other thing
is in the color selection it's kind of
difficult to find colors that kind of
work together and a look that's wearable
you got to be pretty eccentric and
pretty wild to be able to make looks out
of a lot of these so I find it a bit the
color choice to be a little bit
difficult to work with quality of
shadows overall is very good but you do
have some that glitter issue and then
the color selection is a little bit mad
for me so overall it is a good palette
but I don't know if I could would go
back if I would have purchased this but
taught to mainly by it and I decided to
keep it so that says something I did
decide to keep it I could have returned
it and I didn't the next thing that
Taichi made me buy is another eyeshadow
palette because y'all know him an
eyeshadow junkie
lorac pro to the lo the lorac pro 2 is
very different from the vice 4 in that
it is much calmer it's a very relaxed
palette like it's what in the world
look I imagine this being like a seaside
by the beach kind of palette we've got a
lot of this kinds of color here we've
got sandy colors we've got cool tone
purples
we've got bronze II kinds of colors like
it just got this golden color over here
that reminds me of like a sandy golden
beach the quality of these shadows is
amazing there are wonderful quality
they're very easy little blend just like
Todd you said in her video they're very
easy to blend very very easy to work
with another thing I appreciate about
this palette is that it has shades in it
that I don't have anywhere else like
this forest color this is like the
creamiest matte like forest green it is
just absolutely gorgeous and is you with
the lorac pro 2 is the same issue I have
with the vice for the color selection I
don't understand why we need these four
shades why do we need all four of those
I have no idea they're all very similar
they're too similar instead of this give
me a taupe I want a taupe I can't live
without it open a palette so I have to
always reach for another palette or a
single shadow or something to give me
that transition color I feel like these
here are too warm for transition colors
for me if you have a warm skin tone
maybe those will work for you if you
have a deeper warm skin tone maybe this
one will work for you here but for me
look I have trouble getting that good
transition to make it so that my colors
all work well together so is it a win
palette absolutely I like this better
than the vice for if I had to choose
between the two I feel like this one's
easier to work with in the Vice 4 but as
far as a shade range I still feel like
it's not quite where I want it to be the
original mega Pro palette that one had
everything in it that one was amazing
I've got that
up there but that one is too perfect
perfect perfect perfect I feel like this
one is just missing a couple of shades I
wish they had but I'm kind of nitpicking
because this really is a wonderful
palette right the last things that I
want to show you that Tati made me buy
are these babies these are the LOC and
Tati collaboration products with
Birchbox okay so what I ended up doing
is I I saw that these were coming out
and it was huge Birchbox fan first box
and I are pretty tight
you know I love the people over Birchbox
they're also okay I've done
collaboration stuff with Birchbox and
Tati is amazing so I was like Birchbox
plus Tati yes this is gonna be amazing
so what I got was I got the the set that
had it was like the ultimate collection
so it had all five eyeshadows and all
three lip products in the collection and
I'll tell you that when I first used the
eye products I used them with the Mac
Paint Pot in painterly
and they did not last on my eyes and I
was really really sad about it because I
was rooting for these products but then
I used them with the Urban Decay primer
potion and they lasted beautifully
absolutely beautifully so if you are
going to get these just be warned if for
whatever reason they don't seem to be
lasting for the day switch your eye
primer and it may help so let me just go
ahead and swatch these for you at first
let me say toddy did an amazing job
picking the shape so you can see there's
something for everybody in here you've
got a matte gray you have a champagne
you have like an orange e metallic you
have a bronzy metallic then you have
like up this purple leave metallic e
kind of do you have a critique
about the purple one the purple one when
you apply it to the eye the purple
looses its purple enos it turns more
into a grey I think that's a formula
issue so Birchbox if you happen to be
watching this I definitely recommend you
look at reformulating this one to try to
include more purple pigment so the
purple pigment stays that's just a
suggestion but the other ones definitely
stay true to color when you apply them
to the eye I am wearing this one on my
lid today this one is called day trip I
do have a powdered champagne color
underneath it it does blend well with
powdered eyeshadows which I always come
lately shock I expected the powdered
eyeshadows the kind of cake up but they
don't they actually blend very well with
powdered eyeshadows so overall the
formula I am very impressed with that I
really really enjoy these again like I
said I think the colors that trotty
chose are just absolutely stunning and
I'm very very happy these products
overall the only one I'm really
critiquing is this one this one is
called night out and the last thing in
that kit were the three lip colors they
are called glam life wildest dreams and
first kiss I am wearing wildest dreams
on my lips right now you can see that
they are very very very opaque like
really opaque they're very creamy to go
on they don't have a strong scent they
have a very very well if you put them
right up to your nose you can smell like
a very very sweet creamy vanilla kind of
scent and it's like a cake like a cake
frosting vanilla kind of scent but once
you put on the lips you can't smell it
at all when I use this without a lip
liner and this is what happened I used
it on Halloween with my sock monkey
costume if you've been around you saw my
sock monkey costume and I had issues
with where time on this ended it broke
down on my lips very patchy so if you
are going to use this as an all day
lipstick carry it in your pocket so you
can use it to reapply or bring a lip
balm with you and apply it with the lip
balm so that it wears a little more
evenly out but don't just throw this on
your lips and then just leave like
you've got to bring something with you
to help with the fave of it but they are
extremely creamy very moisturizing
really really nice product it's just
that whole fading so this one I did not
wear it on its own because I kind of
gave me dead lip for me it was just a
little bit too nude for me so I mixed it
with something else so I can't really
speak to the wear time of it so we're
both oh it one let me swatch the red one
even though it's already on my lips and
but I mean it goes on the same way it's
the same formula and then this one is
the the glam life one I haven't worn
this one yet either but that one is
gorgeous as well the only other critique
I have of the LOC is just the size in
general I know that they're only
supposed to last one season there but
they are really really real
they break down to a little over $5 per
product they are considered a more
high-end quality so I guess they're kind
of pushing that high ends mark on it as
far as the price per ounce
you only get point zero two ounces in
the lip products and point zero five
ounces in the eyeshadows so it's really
not a lot of product but if you're one
of those people that have a lot of eye
shadows or a lot of lipsticks or go
through products slowly you're probably
not going to notice but if you're
somebody that you just want these and
you want these to be your go-to everyday
you're probably going to run through
them pretty quickly so just kind of keep
that in mind when you're buying them
that they really are pretty small
compared to regular full-size products
so to compare it to some of the deluxe
sized samples that I have I have this
one here this is a makeup forever
lipstick this one right here this is
point zero five ounces so this is very
similar to the size of the eyeshadow
it's actually I've been you're gonna get
in the lip products from ello so those
are the things that Tati made me buy and
