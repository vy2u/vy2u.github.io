I changed my mind about video I've got
quite a few products that I no longer
like that I once liked and then I've got
one product that I like a little more
than the last time I talk to you about
it so if you're interested in what those
products are stay tuned this is me
trying to come on and kind of give you
an update on some of these products that
I use that I want to give you additional
information about the first one is the
positive one this is benefits blowing
airbrush concealer I gave this an awful
review when I first got it it did
absolutely nothing and I feel like the
reason why it did absolutely nothing was
because I was using a brush I found that
with this concealer because it is so so
light weight I really need to just Pat
it in with my fingertips and once I've
done that I feel like it works much
better this is still not for covering in
my opinion any kind of heavy
discoloration blemishes things like that
this is for people that just want to
brighten up and lighten up just very you
know slightly discolored areas for my
under eyes that works out pretty well I
haven't had any creasing with this once
I started patting it in also you have to
be careful not to use too much because
if you use too much it does crease at
least it does on me so just be careful
with this it is a tricky product to work
with you have to figure out how it works
best for you but the end result is I
don't hate it as much as I once did so
that's pretty good next up is the tree
hut bear moisturizing shave gel I raved
about this in a favorites video and I
really loved it at the time what I
didn't realize was that after having
this in my shower and having the hot
water come in contact with the bottle it
ended up melting it was like a little
Wei Li gel kind of consistency and it
melted into a water and was completely
unusable almost if you are going to buy
this I would recommend keeping it out of
your shower or at least very far out of
the water I actually had this on the
floor of my shower for a while and that
was not a good thing so it's more of a
buyer beware on this product it worked
really really well but just just don't
let it melt on
and you'll be fine because it once it
melts it never comes back this product
is one that I used to call me and an
eyeshadow palette I used to say if I was
gonna be made into an eyeshadow palette
this is what I'd be made into I used to
say this was my desert island eyeshadow
palette it's the Too Faced chocolate bar
palette I used to love this thing I
loved it I loved it it doesn't even look
like I've hardly used it does it but I
swear I promise you I have this does
does not float my boat anymore I think
it's maybe because I have a lot more
experience using products now than I did
when I first reviewed this in the first
few years I had my channel two three
years I had my channel this was my
favorite eyeshadow palette but over the
past two years or so I feel like I've
fallen completely out of love with this
palette except for the shades marzipan
and creme brulee I am still in love with
those I still like champagne truffle but
the rest of the palette I could
completely do without
I don't enjoy using it anymore the smell
is almost completely gone I mean this
thing is well past expiration date here
it doesn't smell bad it just doesn't
smell good anymore I mean I've had this
palette for a really long time it is a
12 month expiration so maybe it just is
expired and not working as well anymore
which is totally possible but this
palette right here not in love with it
anymore next up is another product that
I was raving about this is the Roxanne
Rizzo bronze glow bronzing mist for face
and body it's basically a spray tan that
you can do at home I bought this for $40
at IMATS and I loved it when I first
used it and I think I talked about it
later on but I want to make sure that
I'm very clear that I definitely do not
recommend this product anymore and the
reason why is that once you layer it on
as it starts to come off it looks and
makes your skin look like it's
straight-up dirty like dirt I think I
remember talking about this in a chat
once where I was talked about how I was
sitting on the couch and my husband came
over to me and he was like why do your
feet look so dirty it was because of
this also it makes a huge mess
everywhere when you spray it you have to
spray it while you're in the shower or
else it'll make a mess all over your
bathroom
it just it was not ended up not being a
product that I enjoyed if if I could
deal with the mess the smell is amazing
I think I'll of that but as far as the
long-term use of it it's just not
if you're only gonna use it once or
twice and let it fade it's not so bad
but definitely don't layer this up it's
not it's not good the next two are ones
that I did sponsored videos on and this
is the problem that I'm realizing with
sponsored videos that have a time limit
I don't think I'm going to do them
anymore because of these two products
and and the reason why is because I
don't feel like I got enough time to
fully test the products to give a
thorough review I still stand by
everything I said in those videos
because that was my current experience
and I was as honest as I possibly could
be based on my current experience but
because I couldn't use them for a long
length of time I could only give you
that information that I had up to then
and I did say that in the video that I
had only used it for a short period of
time and these were based on that amount
of time so I was very upfront and honest
in the video about that the first one is
the high mirror and the high mirror this
is a crazy device I will link this video
down below in case you want to check it
out basically the idea behind the high
mirror is it's the skin analysis mirror
when you turn it on it analyzes your
problems in your face like your your
wrinkles and your dark spots and your
brightness and all that analyzes
everything and then as you use a
skincare routine it tells you whether
those areas have improved now I'm gonna
put this down because it's heavy this is
the thing they've made it even more
specific now where it can even drill
things down even more than when I showed
you in the video it updates through the
internet so whenever they do an update
it automatically updates without having
to plug it in anywhere the updates just
go to it
I feel like this just was not made for
me I think it's made for people that
have a lot of skin difficulties you know
where you're really having some problems
and you want to see the results of your
skincare but honestly I feel like any
results that are gonna be tracked on
that are going to be visible to you
anyway what I wanted it for was for
review like when I was doing skincare
reviews I wanted to be able it tell me
whether it saw a difference when I used
a new skincare routine one thing that
really irritated me was I had all of my
skincare loaded up into it you can take
a picture of your
products load them in it'll tell you
when you first started using them so you
can keep track of your progress with
that skincare routine well they didn't
update and all my stuff got erased and
that made me really upset because all of
that data that I was collecting was now
gone like in an instant that was really
annoying um and and I really don't feel
like it detects accurately the changes
in my skin because I just don't have a
lot of issues and the issues that I do
have like my anti-aging stuff the
changes that happen because of skincare
are so subtle that I don't think that it
can pick them up I feel like you all can
tell better than that thing oh well my
skincare is working because you have
told me this I was using the scale for a
while I actually like the scale that
came with it better because I can track
my weight on a graph I did find that the
other ways it measures like it measures
your body fat and your bone density and
your your water intake and all that
stuff I found that stuff doesn't seem to
be very accurate sometimes it's just all
over the place but it's a nice way to
track my weight on a graph because it
actually graphs your weight for you and
I did recently lose 10 pounds so that
was really nice to see that weight going
down and watch the you know the 30 day
tracker track my weight up but that was
really cool but I don't think that it's
worth it for the skincare option for the
weight thing kind of yeah I mean if only
if you're gonna track the actual weight
and you want to put it on a graph but
you can buy an app for that probably you
probably don't need a mirror like that
to do it for you and then the last thing
I want to share with you is the tria
hair removal laser I've had a lot of
requests that update on this I will tell
you that the results that you see in the
video when I originally did this are
100% accurate I lost about 75 to 80% of
the hair on my right leg and it was gone
for a good three months and then it
started slowly coming back I've gained
back since then quite a bit of hair
there's still a lot of my hair that has
not grown back but there's definitely a
lot that has especially in my bikini
line my bikini line has completely grown
back totally my right leg it's grown
back by about 50% more since I did the
review but I haven't
use this but one time since I did the
review what was that about a year ago do
you have to keep using it you have to
understand this is not going to be
something that you can use like
permanent laser removal at a treatment
center that you can use and your hairs
just go on forever this is something
you're gonna have to maintain wear every
couple of months you're gonna have to
keep giving yourself treatments on it or
else your hair most likely will come
back if you didn't see the full review
on this as far as pain level and all of
that I will link that down below again I
stand by a hundred percent what I said
in that video for that moment in time I
just wanted to add on the information
for the long-term results that's it for
my products that I changed my mind about
video I hope that you enjoyed it if you
