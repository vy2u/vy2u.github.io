video that I promised you I asked you
guys about a month ago to give me some
questions that you would like for me to
answer and I was absolutely shocked by
the number of questions that you guys
had it was insane like I was thinking
well maybe like I'll get like 10 or 15
questions I got like a ridiculous amount
of questions so thank you all so much
for all of your questions I wish I could
answer all my was playing on answering
all of them but there were so many of
them I just can't in this video and be
like an hour long I'll let you know
again if I'm gonna do another one and I
might even do some of those little live
chats if you guys would be interested in
those I don't know our evenings better
for you guys or a morning I'm a stern
Standard Time so which is negative 5
hours from wherever in London or
whatever it's zero so you know let me
know whether you guys be interested in
the live chat maybe we can hope that
what I did was I I started compiling all
of the questions so that it would be
easy for me to answer because a lot of
them were repeat questions eventually I
just kind of gave up because there were
so many of them so if you were early to
comment I have it in here and if you
were later I might not have it in here
so without further ado let's go ahead
and get going just start with some
general stats age I'm 36 years old I was
born on June 8 1978 which seems like a
very long time ago where do you live
where are you from I live in the
Baltimore Maryland area and I grew up in
the Washington DC area somebody asked me
if I was from Pennsylvania because the
way I say my OS my husband is from
Pennsylvania and I had gotten those O's
from being around him so much siblings I
have an older brother named Chris and
Chris is five years older than me so
that makes him just turning 41 can't
believe it we're getting old Chris we're
getting old somebody asked us up from
the Baltimore area skins or Ravens O's
or NAT skins
I grew up luck my parents loved the
Redskins so if I said anything else I
would be just owned even though I am n
Ray
nation where I'm at ozone ATS I don't
really watch baseball at all we're not
big sports people and the last question
was this John no hallo who's a very
famous tattoo artist this from our area
yes you know his halo halo is amazing
and you google halo tattoos huh yes John
knows them they're not great friends
though favorite TV show orange is the
new black we really enjoy that show
Pretty Little Liars love that show
favorite movie of all time is probably
either a labyrinth or a neverending
story those I love those kinds of movies
we'll get into a little bit more about
that well lighter pets I have two cats
I have star who's the black cat and
Brooklyn who is the orange cat and then
I have a turtle named when avea the
princess turtle all right any other pets
oh and then we have a dog named Sam
who's on vacation right now can we just
come back on vacation so he's still on
his vacation all right favorite food my
favorite food of all time in the council
food is chocolate death-row meal would
be cha probably chocolate-covered bacon
one of my favorite foods of all time um
let's see either that or Alaskan king
crab legs or no it's really good fried
chicken favorite dessert choc
favorite bands don't have one I don't
pay enough attention to music to know
which bands are my favorite John
probably knows my favorite bands better
than I do because he knows the names of
the bands I just know what songs sound
good first job my first job was at
Boston Market which is a like rotisserie
chicken fast-food joint all right family
stuff favorite memory with my kids so
many I mean I just love playing like
going out to parks and stuff with my
kids and watching them just play and
have fun and slide and I don't know um
we take our annual beach trip let's see
we went to if we go to Outer Banks we go
to GBH we go to Chincoteague Island and
then we go to Ocean City and that is
always an awesome vacation so my
memories of those trips are amazing how
many kids do I have which would be a
good question that I should've put
before that I have two kids Lyla is six
and John just turned three on July 26th
how long have I been married this was a
really popular question John and I have
been married we just hit our nine-year
wedding anniversary and we were
together for two and a half years before
that so we met on New Year's Eve at a
New Year's party he is his stepsister
was one of my co-workers and very good
friends and she invited me to a New
Year's party and that is where John and
I met he was 20 I was 24 and did not
have any intention of dating him because
he was so young but he was awesome
and we clicked right away and it was one
of those things where you we just knew
we we clicked so quickly and we just we
don't know it was just one of those
magical things and it was something
about the way that he smelled like he
just smelled right you know he was like
that that natural like pheromone thing
like caveman you Tarzan me Jane I want
to marry you you know it was very
animalistic like that like where we just
knew it was like love connection like
soulmate ness amazingness that was a
very very popular question how long they
married how did we meet
we plan on having more kids no no more
kids two is plenty no no no no no plenty
with two how do you like to spend time
with my family
uh really honestly like just going to
parks and stuff and just playing board
games with them I was playing my little
squirrel game with John earlier where
you colors and then why whatever playing
guess who and you know we play iPad
games together and I don't know it's
doing things that they like that I can
get involved in expectations for my kids
I expect them to be kind I expect them
to be kind if they're being kind then
that is then that kind of covers
everything
I expect me to be kind to everybody
unless someone punches them in the face
then they need to not be kind to them
so there you go tattoos questions about
tattoos I have lots of tattoos I have
liked nine tattoos and they're all on my
back except for I have one on my ankle I
will be doing a tattoo video eventually
the thing about my tattoos is I haven't
gotten them touched up in a while my
husband is a tattoo artist we own a
tattoo studio called tattooed heart
studios and it's Inc when Burnie
Maryland you can google it and find all
of his work and everything but yeah so
he does most of my tattoos there's only
one that he did not do that I got before
I met him he's done all the rest the
tattoos on my back are all fairy tale
themes and movies and different things
like I have
Falkor from the neverending story on my
shoulder kind of show you a little bit
of Falkor I don't know as much as I can
show you and then this little guy this
is the owl from the movie labyrinth so
that's where those movies come in I'm
getting a big Cinderella Castle in the
middle I've got a big giant mermaid on
my side I've got a little tattoo uh it
was a cartoon that I used to love called
the seed prints in the fire child so
I've got C prints down like all my hip
kind of under the mermaid but I'll do a
whole like tattoo video at some point
one of my old friends from keek says can
John tattoo me and I was like uh if you
if you make an appoint with John John
will tattoo you most likely he's very
close I know this woman will come up
will I start speaking of pets will John
show his tattoos I don't know honestly
he's he's he's got so many tattoos it
will be like an hour-long video he's got
both of his full sleeves he's got stuff
on his arms he's got a huge back piece
he's got his chest all done and huge
long long video maybe we'll do it one
day teaching questions how long have I
been a teacher this I'm going into my
tenth year as a an elementary school
teacher I am a fourth grade teacher I
used to be a special education resource
teacher until last year when they
switched me to fourth grade there was an
issue where the staffing changed and my
friend Mary Lynn was actually going to
be cut from her position and I told and
she couldn't go full-time so I told them
she could have my job and I switched to
fourth grade because I did not want her
to be transferred so that's how I ended
up and I was not a resource teacher
anymore
so next year with my second year as a
fourth-grade teacher do I students know
about my channel one of them does one
and if she's watching this hi sweetie
one of them found my channel at the very
end of the school year last year and I
asked her very kindly not to tell
anybody about it because I just I want
to make a big deal out of it if they
find it that's okay because my channel
is clean but no I try to keep that part
of my life away from my students advice
for someone going in to treat teaching
don't know I'm just kidding
just being prepared for it the
unexpected especially for elementary
school don't do what I did and thinking
oh I think I'll be an elementary school
teacher because it sounds like it's easy
it's not easy it's not easy it is really
hard like you don't realize as a child
how much work your teacher does in order
to prepare for you to learn you don't
realize how much your teacher does
outside of school to make sure that you
are ready to learn I mean it's just
insane
the amount of work that goes into
teaching so just be prepared for that
and know that you are going to be
working off of school hours know that
you will be dealing with a customer
service aspect meaning you're dealing
with parents who may or may not be happy
with you for logical and or illogical
reasons make sure that you are prepared
for students not necessarily to
appreciate the fact that you want to
teach them something and and just go in
with that mindset also you've got to be
flexible you've got to be flexible with
kids you've got be flexible parents
you've got to be flexible with your
coworkers you've got to be flexible with
yourself and your teaching style you
cannot be rich and you can't go in and
say this is what I'm going to do this is
the way I'm going to teach it in the way
it's gonna be done it's not gonna work
you're constantly in a state of flux as
a teacher so just be prepared for that
appropriate makeup I do a lot of nude
looks for makeup for work I don't wear a
lot of blush like this ain't happen and
this ain't happening for work I wear a
lot of new lipsticks I wear just a lot
of glosses Margaret asked about hi
Margaret Margaret I think I trade Jen I
trade with you want a tip I totally
tried it with Margaret on Edom hi
Margaret
Margaret asked about nail polish as a
teacher my nails are always a top
conversation with my students and not in
a distracting way like they absolutely
especially the girls really love my
nails everyone so I'll do something
crazy for the boys I'll make it all a
little more masculine for them but uh
but yeah they love my nails I might and
really honestly it depends on your
principle it depends on what your boss
says and if your boss doesn't say
anything I say go for it you know make
your nails all funky why did I want to
be a teacher I didn't actually I
originally wanted to this was another
question I got asked somewhere what did
I always want to be I wanted to be an
actress for a really long time big
shocker right and then you know I didn't
I couldn't handle the audition process I
couldn't handle being the whole
rejection thing well I was in Community
College ended up in the mental health
field I got an associate's degree in
mental health and then I decided I
wanted to be in our occasional therapist
I quit that after a month and when I
realized that a nagging physiology was
too hard for me so I couldn't memorize
anything for to save my life so I
switched to special education and that
is kind of where I started and I figured
you know I just I love kids I love
helping kids
I love figuring things out like when
there's like a puzzle and like figuring
out how things work and the kids that
have learning difficulties or like
little puzzles and figuring out what
they need so that was really attractive
for me I didn't have any idea how hard
it was gonna be but it's totally worth
it because of the little people that
I've met I met such wonderful people the
kids and parents and everything it's
just it's amazing and I'm very thankful
to have been a teacher but I didn't want
to be a teacher for a really long time
until I got into I'm gonna like okay the
things about it kind of like it
hobbies uh YouTube is pretty much all I
have time for YouTube my kids my job
that's pretty much all I have time for
paint my nails
I mean honestly that's all I do I know
that side but that's all pretty much all
I do I used to have more hobbies than
that but not so much anymore
I just started reading now that I don't
have a job right now since it's summer I
just started reading I'm in almost done
with divergent I finished divergent I
finished insurgent and now I'm about
half a little more than halfway through
Allegiant
I love it let's see what's something
geeky that you love Julia Julia's got me
stumped in this with something geeky
that I love
Amy's movies is that geeky because I'm
not into like anime or like typical
geeky stuff
it used to be computers like I remember
when computers first started like home
computers start really blowing out my
ex-boyfriend used to tease me for really
loving being on computer saying I was
geek because I love being on computer
but it's not really geeky anymore
how do you balance everything I neglect
some things some things just don't get
done that's how I do it and my husband
helps me a lot when I start falling
behind on house stuff he totally hooks
me on if I didn't have him I wouldn't be
able to do YouTube there's no way if
you're ever in Louisiana Mississippi
Alabama will you let me know if he can
hang out
yes yes for you yes absolutely it's the
best place I've ever traveled to Jamaica
we've been to Jamaica twice for a
honeymoon and then for a five-year
anniversary and yeah Jamaica love
Jamaica jump back into this now that I
got a fresh and fresh that battery would
you do a draw my life I had planned to
do a draw my life and then I realized
that I couldn't draw it's really hard to
do a draw my life I didn't realize how
difficult it was but if I ever get the
guts up to do it I will but I don't know
if that's gonna happen just because I
it's really hard to do favorite memory
from my childhood lots of good memories
my childhood I actually got a really
nice childhood it was slightly boring
I watched way too much television as a
child she's going to the beach with my
family my brother used to play Cabbage
