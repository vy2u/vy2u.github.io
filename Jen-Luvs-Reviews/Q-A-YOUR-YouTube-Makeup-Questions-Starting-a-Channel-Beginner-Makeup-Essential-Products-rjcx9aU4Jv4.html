YouTube stuff and makeup stuff so let's
go into the YouTube stuff and then we'll
go into the makeup stuff and then this
video is gonna be done okay how has
YouTube impacted my life I have no life
maritza that's how it's impacted my life
is that I have no life now now that I
have YouTube but I love YouTube I wanted
to be an actress but I didn't really
want it audition and I didn't really
want to learn any lines so now I had to
do that and just be myself if you could
change one thing about the YouTube
community what would it be and it would
be the hierarchy of you know someone
with more subscribers is better that
bugs me or some with more views is
better that people feel that way
subscribers and people who make videos
everybody seems to believe that and it's
just not true you know we're all people
who are all human beings whether you
have a YouTube channel or not we're just
people we all cou have you ever feel
like you're intimidated by somebody just
imagine them pooping you know that's
what I do and you know they'll go back
to being at square one just like
everybody else
that's worst thing about having YouTube
channel worst thing is it takes a lot of
time honestly that's the that's the
worst thing is that I just don't have
time to do a lot of other things that I
would like to do like watch television
or read books
I'm just making YouTube videos and then
the best thing is meeting people the
best thing definitely is meeting that my
subscribers and meeting friends and just
keep in touch with people and getting
opinions from people and learning people
and laughing with people and it's just
fun do you get grief from other known
youtubers no known youtubers like no one
like meeting people with lots and lots
of scrubbers they don't know who I am
and no I don't get any grief from
anybody that I know unless they talk
about me behind my back and if they do
y'all let me know right my first video
are you ready for this I'm gonna show
you a clip of my first video it was on
my old channel you said a channel 4
channel of 37 and I started that in 2006
in the baby stage of YouTube and I'm
gonna show you a clip of my first video
right now oh my name is Amanda coming it
demand able and I have something
I was walking down the street the other
night and they saw a man who had a
bandaid on his nose but it wasn't on his
nose and was on his face lying flat on
his face where his nose should be and I
thought that man doesn't have a nose how
much must it suck to not have a nose I
mean besides that you wouldn't be able
to smell nice things light of a pie and
cinnamon and and Christmas trees and and
and and parsley and and and and
rutabagas besides you wouldn't be able
to smell those things do you you have
well everybody you know they'd be people
blow their nose and things and well when
he still makes the stuff that you blow
out your nose or would it oh I don't
even want to think about that that's so
gross
and then and then and then people would
see you on the street and they would
look at you and they would say wow
that's me it doesn't the girl or that
mean it doesn't have a nose and then you
would think oh if I only had a nose my
life would be wonderful and Jax would
didn't mean well boys ways would like
but you can't just go by a nose I mean
Walmart they sell lots of things but
they don't sell noses no they don't
so yes that was my first video are you
shocked I hope so because that was a
really long time ago and that was a very
very fun video to shoot and I hope you
enjoyed watching that because it's
really ridiculous but that's me some
technical stuff program for recording I
don't use a program for recording I just
used my Canon t3i that's my camera that
I use lighting for recording I use box
like softbox light right above it's
right here and I don't have any natural
lighting in my house or else I would use
that but I don't have it either they're
a very small house best camera the
scammer I found is this Canon t3i but I
found the iPhones really take nice nice
videos except for you got to make sure
they're not this way they've got to be
this way because people will click off
your video because you're this way if
you're this way you know people will
automatically think that the video is
not going to be any good because most
video shot that way aren't even if yours
is awesome
people assume it's not so turn cameras
oddly as my friends and people will get
at least give me more of a shot best
camera and the 200 to $300 range look
for a good solid video camera not a
photo camera I don't know any specific
sorry Leslie what inspires you other
youtubers inspire me my friends inspire
me products inspiring I make videos my
kid I mean in life my kids inspire me my
students inspire me my parents are
amazing people my husband of course
inspires me makes me laugh every day
favorite YouTube favorites so many
channels that I love that's why I'm
featuring them the end of all my videos
now favorite YouTube channels though
role models beauty icons people that
look up to an YouTube Emily Noelle 8-3
is my number one Tati over agley my glam
life guru I love graveyard girl is one
of my absolute favorites I adore her
like if I could just give her a hug I
would just die I would probably
I like to say I love her those are the
big ones those are those the big ones
that I like really look up to there is
that suena that's a plain enough mrs.
little Elana I love her
there's a bunch there's a lot honestly
but those are the ones sit Kristin game
I love Kristin game any tubers you'd
like to meet all of those all of you I
would like to meet all of you what
YouTube opportunities are you hoping to
get I would love to would be to design
my own eyeshadow palette that will be
amazing I would love that
that would that would be incredible or
to work with a company in order to
design something that would be awesome I
started YouTube because I like being in
front of the camera I enjoy it I like
talking to people I like meeting people
and this puts all of that fabulous in
this together in one package deciding my
theme well I I had had Jenn left 37 and
that was a vlog Channel and vlog was
kind of died as YouTube got bigger than
he really cared anymore so I had to find
something else and I was watching a lot
of marlane Omega P TV use another person
I really look up to and she she was
doing beauty videos I was like I I love
makeup I want to do Beauty videos too so
that's kind of how that came about and
the subscription box thing kind of came
about by accident I actually wasn't
gonna do subscription box videos for you
know at all but companies started
contacting me asking me to send me stuff
starting with boxycharm and I was like
ah sure and then work subscription box
companies are asking me to open I'm
solid like sure and then now all of a
sudden I'm a subscription box opening
channel I don't know how that happen
this channel has been around since like
what like a year and a half year and a
half ish I didn't making videos almost
two years and we cheers in October and
then my Jen loves Jenna left 37 channel
was around from 2006 to 2009 so for
three years so that's kind of my youtube
life their advice for starting a new
channel just decide what you want to
talk about and talk about make sure you
know what you're talking about before
you start filming have fun don't take it
too seriously I think that's a big
problem a lot of people they take too
seriously they're like if their table is
not growing they're like I'm gonna tell
it right it's not because you're stuck
it's because YouTube's huge that's why
so just don't take it too seriously have
fun when you get a few subscribers that
are watching your videos enjoy having
conversations with them
just enjoy that part of it because that
part will always be there whether you
know your channel grows or whatever just
enjoy where you're at in the moment and
as your channel grows you enjoy where
you're at that and enjoy where you're
out then and just have fun with it you
know and do what you love talk about
what you want to talk about do I get
recognized in the community new the only
time I've ever been recognized was that
I'm ats and that was by two people at
IMATS so I'm not the point where people
recognize you on the street yet that'd
be pretty funny though what do family
coworkers husband children think of my
videos my parents my mom watches my
videos occasionally hi mom my dad does
not watch my videos my brother and his
wife don't watch my videos my co-workers
are super supportive my coworkers are
like cheering me on like my team my
fourth-grade team they're just like and
my husband of course cheers me on my
kids cheer me on my kids the only thing
they don't like about it is that it
takes away time from them especially
when after film during the day like now
a lot I try to shoot at night after
they're asleep but sometimes that's just
not possible or I'm just exhausted so I
have to film during the day but that's
the one thing they don't like about it
is it takes time away from them which I
don't like either that's why I try to
film at night more family videos yes
I've been trying to incorporate Lila in
a little bit more you know trying to get
the kids in a little more Guilin Jean
we're both in a video and of course my
husband John is in a lot of videos
lately so yes more family videos how do
you handle rude comments mostly I just I
delete them you don't see them mostly
the time because I delete them for you
can see him I I don't I don't I block
and then I delete and that's the end you
know and honestly if I if I said my
feelings weren't hurt by comment I would
be lying my feelings to get hurt
I totally found the whip when it comes
to comments I like it's like a punch in
the stomach when someone says something
you know really mean and it's just you
know even if it's completely just out
there I still take a personal I'm
terrible at it can you the lipstick tag
I don't know if you guys would be
interested in my lipstick collection my
lipstick collection is pretty lame I
don't know maybe maybe crystal how much
does my face cost tag I've never seen
that one off check that one out thanks
for the request work requests miss
crystal I will I'll look into those
possibly I so my especially since I went
on vacation I have so much backed up
it's just stupid how many videos I need
a shoot is stupid so I'm gonna try to
fit them in you know I'll look at them
and then I'm gonna try to fit him in if
I feel like y'all like him enough all
doing but I gotta leave boxes and the
boxes are like time limits on I want to
I don't know if I can but I try okay
make up stuff okay have I always been
into makeup yes for as long as I can
remember my mom sold Avon and I loved
looking through her makeup she had like
a little case with a bunch of lipstick
samples in it and I love playing with
that I started actually wearing makeup
when I was 12 maybe 13 somewhere in
there
sixth seventh grade my mom let me pretty
much do whatever I want when it came to
makeup mostly did you know lip gloss
eyeliner lip gloss and eyeliner
that's pretty much all I wore for a long
time then I throw in some mascara I was
pretty much up for a while
beauty icons Jennifer Lopez is a big
icon of mine that's pretty much it
Jennifer Lopez she's amazing love jumper
Lopez favorite perfume when do I change
it what do I wear for date night I'll
get it for you awesome these roller
balls I love these roller balls I have
Clara bomb by Viktor and Rolf
I have Daisy by Marc Jacobs I have a
couple of Juicy Couture ones Viva La
Juicy and Viva La Juicy left blue these
are kind of my daytime want and honestly
for a nighttime date night I love this
one this is midnight fantasy by britney
spears I love it I can tell but it's I
know it's very young but I love it new
favorites I just got these on Groupon so
excited these are the Rihanna perfumes
these are amazing
I forget what each one is called but
they're her little perfuse now I doesn't
say what they are but I love these these
smell these
okay and also this is one my husband
really likes his Katy Perry's / likes
that one a lot I try to go for the
smaller versions of perfumes if I can
help it because I never go through a
whole perfume so and they're easier to
store we have a little tiny house like I
said earlier so small perfumes are good
for me only one beauty product for a
month would probably be some type of
eyeliner I've been using a lot of the
Schwing eyeliner by the balm it's a
liquid liner and a pen liner had a baby
it would be the swing by the balm and I
really like it a lot it's a little bit
more of a liquid liner than it is a pen
liner but it's got a point like a pen
liner and you know I mean like you stop
to dip it like a liquid but it's got a
point like a pen I really like it a lot
so maybe that some kind of eyeliner
would be my choice beauty products I
can't live without top three beauty
products in general eyeliner mascara
maybe blush lip gloss I don't know but
let me show you I just went on vacation
I'll show you some essentials that I
would not have been able to live without
this is what I brought on vacation with
all my makeup in it and I filled this
David through the brown let me tell you
through the brim with makeup this was
essential for me on vacation that Kat
Von D Esperanza palette as laura geller
blush this is a big plus blush in
ethereal robes was essential this cargo
palette and warm neutral was essential
for me mary lou manizer by the balm
essential Kat Von D blushes are my
favorite formula this concealer by Yves
pearl this is the duo and Fairlight love
this thing
this was gosh way Nancy that's pretty
much it I think was essential like
essential like I needed it couldn't live
without it
so my Mac Paint Pot parently I love that
too those were some of the essentials in
her life as far as makeup goes
Munem this video is solo are you still
here
favorite nail polish color in general is
like a light pink probably I switch it
up so much I went into a store and got
some nail polish and they're like I was
trying to slide what color one they're
like well what's your favorite color and
it's like girl
it doesn't matter what my favorite color
is like it's nail polish it doesn't
matter what my favorite photos because
because that's not what I'm wearing on
my nails chances are you know like I had
every single color like see that that's
that's that's my nail polish collection
I have everything it's not about my
favorite color is I'm kind of diggin on
this one though this dark blue with the
daisies on it from my scratch
subscription but I like white with
design lately digging on that favorite
make a brand overall is probably either
Kat Von D or the balm overhyped brand no
doubt about it NARS NARS is to me and my
personal opinion the most overhyped
brand NARS and Stila not to say there
aren't good products from NARS and Cielo
because definitely are some fantastic
products menorahs and cielo but people
some people act like every single
product they make is just boy it's norms
it's gonna be amazing it's not okay NARS
eyeshadows are not that fantastic and
steal a steal a have some fantastic
eyeshadows but they also have some crap
eye shadows I don't know what the deal
is with that what advice would you give
people starting out in makeup start with
one thing start with one thing that you
feel like accentuates a part of your
face so if you like your lips start out
with some clear gloss if you start like
your eyes start out with some mascara if
you want to accentuate your cheekbones
start out with a little bit of blush I
mean start with one thing then figure
out add on one more thing you know don't
go all crazy you know don't start with
foundation okay maybe a little bit
concealer don't start with foundation
because foundation can make you look
weird okay if you don't do it right so
let's start with that start with some
lip gloss you know I'm saying don't
start out contouring and winging your
eyeliner and all that start off simple
work your way up but if you could only
have one subscription box what would it
be box a charm
no doubt about it it would be boxycharm
box a charm is ridiculous how awesome
boxycharm has become boxy charm didn't
start out that way boxy charm started
out a little they did a lot of drugstore
products some of them were discontinued
a lot of them were overstock like it was
like it was okay but it's not what it is
today
today it's insane how awesome boxycharm
is so definitely box a charm
you know I really want to do more like
this Delilah Delilah was like a million
views I have one question for you what
if you what would you do if you had a
million dollars like the Barenaked
Ladies song if I had a million dollars I
would buy a house I would buy a house I
would because this house is tiny and I
need a bigger house and I have I will
tell you I have one closet in this house
one closet and it's in my daughter's
room and it's packed full of clothes I
don't even wear like I have one bathroom
and the bathroom is the size of a closet
and I will tell you there isn't a single
outlet in that bathroom don't ask me how
that happened actually you can't ask me
it's because this house was built by a
man that's why there's no outlets in the
back room if I quit YouTube tomorrow
what's one memory that would stick with
me forever talking to my subscribers I'm
gonna edit on that thank you so much for
watching I really appreciate it thank
you for being here for me thank you for
being interested
thank you for your sweet words thank you
for encouraging me and thank you for
being my friends I I genuinely mean that
from the bottom of my heart thank you
mad love and I'll see you in the next
video I'm reading through some of the
questions I didn't get to and I have to
I have to answer this if you're are you
afraid of anything I'm terrified of
zombies like I know that's an irrational
fear but I'm terrified of zombies like
anything zombie related like honestly
like I watched was that Shaun of the
Dead which is a comedy movie I had
nightmares for weeks after watching that
movie like something about when people
like that are ugly people turn into
zombies like they're not themselves
anymore and now they're a zombie and
trying to kill me like that just
terrifies me zombies I'm not you're
kidding it's horrible do I remember how
long it took me to get a hundred
subscribers
like six months maybe anything you'll
ever stop making videos I don't know
whenever I feel like I need to stop I
don't know I don't see myself stopping
anytime soon my most viewed video is
Prancer sized for now soon it'll be trip
out making money on YouTube and being a
beauty guru for my prancercise parody
stupid you don't watch it as stupid I
can't stop I can't stop this video
what's up my mom told me all right I
gotta go talk to my mom about how long
have I been married this was a really
popular question a caveman you Tarzan me
Jane I want to marry you are we planning
on having more kids tattoos questions
about tattoos unless someone punches
them in the face then they need to not
be kind to them oh I think I'll be an
elementary school teacher because it

embarrassing moment in my life thus far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
