subscription service for you to show you
it's one that I've never showed you
before I haven't seen a lot about it on
youtube so I'm really excited to show it
to you I'm always really excited but I
can't help it I don't know what's a good
synonym for excited I'm ecstatic I'm you
know i just realized i left the box over
there ok so anyway i'm happy about this
because i'm always excited to show you
something new to give you an idea of
whether you would like to subscribe to
it or not and there's only one way to
know and that's to hear an honest review
from somebody that it's already gotten
it so this one is one called q box and a
little like this q box is 2495 a month
it's five to seven beauty / jewelry /
home and cute stuff and all that and it
is all primarily from Japan and South
Korea so I've never gotten a in the
international beauty subscription before
what's guess my beauties description
I've never gotten an international
subscription before so I'm excited to
try this so let's just go ahead and jump
in and see what is in this Q box oh and
they guarantee that it will be at least
sixty dollars worth of stuff so let me
go ahead and open this I have not opened
this yet and just to remember they did
send us to me for review it comes with a
little thank-you card refer friends and
get a free q box it's get cubox com not
just Q box that takes you to something
totally different you get a little
magnet here and then there's a picture
with all of the items on it and I'm not
going to look because I want it to be a
surprise so it comes really beautifully
packaged it's got this little Gordon
boat here if you know like a paper
instead of like a ribbon which is kind
of cute and then this little sticker and
it's got little birds on it this is very
interesting I've never gotten a
subscription quite like this before okay
so the first thing they gave us are some
tea and I am NOT a big fan of tea but
they got me on something it says
chocolate hazelnut I might have to try
this even though I'm not a big fan of
TIA I am a huge fan of chocolate so I
will be trying this one I don't know if
i'll try this mango passionfruit one
this one will probably go to my mom it's
a caffeine-free herbal tea yep and this
one is decaf as well so very interesting
there we got some brookside dark
chocolate goji and I think they sell
this at costco and I do like these I
don't think there's actual goji berry if
i remember right in these I think it's
more of like a gelatinous like goji
berry flavor in there I don't know let's
try them let's just jump right in and
try them so we can sink so it's just
like a little ball of chocolate almost
looks like a malted milk ball or
something but I know that sound what's
in here mm-hmm it's like on the chewy
Center they're good though it's got a
tartness to it with the dark chocolate
which I really like that combination hmm
chocolate my lips sorry about that but
these will definitely be gone very
quickly another little snack buzz fudge
drizzled caramel popcorn by thin
stations christy is the name of the
brand let's see oh it's a Canadian brand
from Ontario and this one is hershey
that's why I've seen it before let's go
ahead and try that you know now see what
it's like and it's fudge get the little
popcorn pieces here know if you can see
that meaning you like it looks like it
looks like a piece of popcorn a caramel
piece of popcorn with fudge on it and
that's exactly what it tastes like next
up i see this is cute it says sparrow
key ring you got a little birdie in
there so that's kind of interesting it's
a little birdie in a box and I guess you
you put your key on here ok ok so the
birdie came out and it's a little bird
whistle so I guess it's like you're in
danger you can like grab your keys and
blow on your little cutesy
pink birdie whistle and then you hook it
into the little box and there you go and
it's got little stickies on the back so
that you don't lose your kids you stick
this to the wall that's cute I will
totally use this claim for ever losing
my keys and that is just adorable oh my
goodness I love that is this I don't
know what that is let's say ribbon cup
cap cap cap cap free cup so it's like a
set silicone a silicone little topper
magic bow magic leak-proof silicone mug
cup lid so you put this over oh I'm a
huge coffee drinker and I always drink
out of coffee mugs you put this over
your coffee mug and it keeps the heat in
mm-hmm that is cute this is going to
work with me so because I sometimes will
bring an actual mug to work and I'll put
this over top and then I go off and i
teach and then my coffees like frozen
cold so maybe this will help keep some
of the heat in that is really exciting
so singing cute all right I got a
necklace I think a little baggie bag is
in this velvet pouch whoa that's long
holy goalie Olli okay this is not really
my style I don't know about this one
Hank not really my style it's a bug no
it's a bird it's a bird on a branch and
it looks like it's like looking at some
eggs in a basket and it's very very long
I'm not the biggest fan of long
necklaces yeah um you know you guys
wouldn't when I do subscription boxes
and sometimes i give things away this I
think is going to be for one of you so
if you're interested in this bird
necklace if this is more your style then
go ahead and leave a comment down below
that you're interested in it and then
anybody commenting within the first 24
hours of the upload of this video will
be entered into the giveaway for this
and you could win it so I will let you
know you just have to tell me in your
comment with whatever else you want to
say that you are interested in the bird
necklace and you can have it because
this really isn't my style i prize
where this main rudder is the name of
the brand and then it's got like a
little a little wheel on the back like
for the clasp that just says main rudder
it's like a steering little thing like
you see on a boat so yeah I mean that
that part's cute if that was the main
bar the necklace I would probably wear
now I'm just gonna set it back in this
little bag and I'll send it to you just
like that I see this little Percy thingy
this is cute it's like a little metal /
so I wonder what it does it is a mini
Birkin bag coin case okay um I would
probably give this to my daughter this
isn't something that I would probably
keep it's just not something that I
would probably use but I know my
daughter would love this to play with
use it with her little dolls and then
then Oh another thing she's gonna freak
out she's gonna freak out it's hello
kitty ok so these cute little hello
kitty I don't know what they are they're
called bud clicks not sure what a bud
click is a bud click hello kitty cable
cord holder clip and they have it
attached a headphone so I guess when
you're moving around or whatever if
you're got too much cord too much slack
on your headphones you can clip them up
so she does have headphones that she
uses so I will be passing those to her
as one more things looks like a lot of
stuff ok this is a lucky bookmark very
cute let me show that to you ok so
that's a cute little feather design it
seems very very thin but I like that for
books this is so stinking cute it's very
thin so it have to be very careful with
it but it's adorable and then one more
thing it's a black box so like this Oh
cute it's a pen very cute it's a bit oh
I think it's a stylist look at the end I
think it's a stylist look at these
kisses cute let me look it is crystal
touch screen stylus ballpoint pen to the
pen rolls up yep works very nicely its
Blacky ok so there is the pen it's got
little beads in it and then there's the
stylus it's very squishy though most
styluses that i see and don't squish in
like that so I'll have to try that and
see if it works I'll put a note and then
it's just a cute little pet ok so that
is very cute that will be put to good
use i have an eye
pan and an iphone so I'll probably
attach this to my iPad I don't have a
stylist for it right now so very excited
to get that so we definitely got more
than twenty-five dollars worth of stuff
i will put the full price of what came
in here there and you can decide for
yourself whether these items would be
something you'd be interested in there
weren't any makeup or beauty items in
here so that's not something that i can
speak to as far as what kind of makeup
and beauty items they said because they
didn't send any this time i think this
is one of those that i think will be up
to your personal preference of whether
you would use these types of things or
not whether it will be worth it to you
so i hope you enjoyed that box opening
of q box if you did make sure you give
