box opening i will link my first down
below in case you're curious first
impression of the cubox was there was a
lot of birds in the last box we got like
a bird necklace we got a bird whistle we
got like bird everything everything was
like birds so I'm really curious to see
whether they all have Birds or that was
just the theme for the box q box is a
very interesting subscription everything
in it comes from i believe japan and
korea so it's like little trinkets and
makeup items sometimes and like little
like useful little household things like
i use i got these like little hello
kitty like they're supposed to like clip
your earbuds or whatever so that your
cord stays untangle i use them for my
softbox lights and they work amazing i
use them all like they're like that's
what i used and oh and they gave me like
this cup cat thing was like this little
like silicone thing that you put on top
of your coffee mug and it keeps your
coffee hot and helps you coffee not from
spilling to stop from spilling and I
seriously got compliments on that thing
at work every time I had on my coffee I
people like oh my gosh that's so cute
where'd you get that leg I got it from Q
Boggs actually okay before I get into
this let's take a moment to appreciate
the shirt do you get it do you get it
buffy and the Scoobies I don't know do
you get it if you get it put a comment
down below if you get my shirt because I
was obsessed for a long period of time
and had you buy the shirt ok so anyway q
box is twenty-five dollars a month and
it's kind of like a meanie box and that
you can order it every month like you
have to order it every month or you can
buy three months ahead of time or six
months ahead of time it does say that
the sep tember box is already sold out
so if you want the october box you would
need to log in now and try to purchase
that okay so let's just go in to see
what's in the queue box and whether it's
just a bunch of stuff i'll never use or
some useful stuff that I'm excited about
whether it's worth $26 cute little
pamphlet in here very nice and it's gots
a little rib the little bow here which i
think is super cute because you know
somebody hand tied that that's just
adorable and then the pamphlet has all
of the products inside
and I'm not going to look we're just
gonna oh no oh and see what is imagined
oh I can't open the Bo it's not opening
these are going straight to my little
girl it's this little cute little bag
with these cute little tassels and then
inside we have a necklace and earring
set and it's a little strawberry with
little bunnies so I can't really see
myself wearing these but i can see Lila
wearing them so she'll get those those
are cute and then there's the back of it
I think this would be really cute for
teenager or someone it may be in their
early 20s but probably not beyond that I
don't know what y'all wear some little
bunny earrings and a little strawberry
necklace I don't know maybe I'm all face
on that sometimes my age things you guys
say go you're not too old to wear that
so what y'all think next thing I see see
this is something I might be too old to
use but I'm going to use it anyway these
are decent earbuds and they have little
bears on them look at the little birds
oh I so cute oh let's admire dig a
minute to admire the bacon nails yes
might one of my eggs chipped but eggs
and bacon yes I did that so that's
really cute I definitely need some
earbuds and I will totally rock these at
the gym I don't care alright next thing
I see looks like some food oh I don't
know what it is should we just open it
and eat it not knowing what it is they
just look like little like little
pockets with some brown stuff inside
hopefully that brown sellers chocolate
because you don't know how much I love
Chopin just let's just open and eat it I
don't even know what it is that's not
being a good role model don't ever just
open some and eat it I just I trust key
box all right so there are these little
like pockety things mm-hmm chocolate on
a whitish like it tastes like cereal
like um like a very plain cereal let's
chop up bud inside that's good I mean
another one I just read something else
is in here I need to stop I need to just
keep going I don't know what it is but
it was yummy ok the next thing I'm
seeing is the contact the concept eyes
lip pigment
and if it's orange we are going to might
be in some trouble here whoa what is
that is that like a little lip brush
maybe whoo interesting a little scared
of this because it just looks so bright
we'll try it anyway really into the lip
and cheek tints lately because i've been
getting so many in subscription boxes
okay so that's how that's the look in
and then it feels very um whoa that's
some serious pigmentation holy moly
blends out pretty nicely though it feels
it has kind of almost like a look of the
lip gloss kind of feeling not super
sticky but a little bit sticky so it's
definitely thicker than the stains that
I've seen recently in my subscription
boxes it does look like it's buildable
it's a little loud but we'll play with
it it'll be nice for fall though I've
been known to wear an orange blush or
two and even a red blush of a Knicks red
blush that I love in the fall so I will
definitely try that and then this here
this is what I saw this is cool this is
a toilet seat handle by happy wing and
having a boy who is potty training my
son is three and he's still potty
training this actually makes me super
happy it looks like what you do is you
put it on your toilet seat and instead
of touching the toilet seat to pull it
off you use this instead which I am
super excited about yes I stole that
from graveyard girl uh this I don't
really get how it attaches though okay
there's a little yep there's this little
thing I guess that's what you attach it
with and then there's some directions I
hope down at the bottom oh they're
folded in you use its double-sided tape
you clean the surface and you use the
double-sided tape and you attach it
there and then you put that under your
toilet seat and then you can lift this I
am super excited about this whether
y'all be super excited about this
probably not unless you got a boy if
it's potty training or a little boy in
your house or even at you know what any
boy because they have to touch that see
all this thing in time that's one of the
most exciting things I've gotten a
description box in a long time just
because it's something I never probably
would have bought but I will definitely
use I don't know this okay choo-choo cat
postcard angel so their little angel cat
postcards help which are pretty cute
here's all the different designs so I go
through adorable little god they're so
cute there is a one on the front so cute
so i don't know i will I use postcards I
don't know if I'd use postcards i mean i
just i don't really send people letters
maybe i'll send my mom a letter and
maybe my grandma too cuz i think they
would like these little postcards not
very excited about these but you know
it's all good i'll be excited about
everything you know they're cute okay
and the last thing in here looks like a
little lunch bag and it's got a snap has
kind of a funky smell but that's okay
and that's really cute i'm gonna be
walking into work this year instead of a
cup cap being my leg thing everybody's
like that's so cute it's gonna be my
cutie little lunch bag the cubox gave me
and it's by cath kidston and I'm sure
the snow will wash out but it got like a
plasticky like uh I don't know strange
smell to it but that's okay I don't
really care about that stuff when it
comes to bags my makeup products I care
about it but not my bags so excited
about that so let's see about the value
of this August q box let's see the lunch
bag is twenty-eight dollars holy moly
$92 of what I'm calculating very quickly
so that is a huge value for twenty-five
dollars and really cool unique stuff
that I never would have thought to buy I
mean this is a super cute little lunch
bag got a reddish orange cheek stain
which I probably wouldn't have purchased
but we'll definitely try and use got
some earbuds that I needed uh and will
totally rock got some postcards that I
don't need but i'll send a letter to my
grandma and sho preciate is so you know
i got some yummy delicious chocolate
candy thingies I got some cute earrings
and a necklace for my daughter and the
best thing of all the toilet seat handle
mm-hmm that's my favorite thing in the
box I'm not even kidding so I am very
excited about Cuba it's all like these
boxes i will review them more often and
this was a really interesting cool box
to be completely honest I really like
the socks a lot and if y'all like it too
i'll do more reviews of it if y'all
think you just want to see it every few
months i'll just do it every few months
