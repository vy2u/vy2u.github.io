things I wanted to talk to you about
really quickly first thing is well the
reason for this video is that I was
picked by my son's teacher to go on a
field trip with him today so I had to
cancel a doctor's appointment and
reschedule that for September because I
could not miss this field trip so
Tabitha and I were talking about doing a
makeup minute last night but we're so
big into this hallo beauty research that
we forgot to do the makeup minute
because she's helping me she'd she said
you know what's going on and I said you
feel like looking up some ingredients
for me she was like sure so she's been
helping me with with the ingredients a
little bit so I haven't had a chance to
look over all of that yet it looks like
my mic volume is blowing out hopefully
it sounds ok turn it down just a little
bit okay but anyway so anybody here or
there are people here oh yeah it is
working so yeah so this morning because
I forgot there isn't going to be a
makeup minute this morning I just want
to let you know that also I usually
upload my videos on Tuesdays and
Thursdays I worked really hard to get
that lock seat on video up to you
yesterday if you went up really late
hopefully you watch it it's actually
really really good if you love
ingredient analysis there are skip ahead
buttons if you want to just get to the
nitty-gritty of my review there skip
ahead buttons in the video description
but if you like ingredient alysus if you
want to learn about skincare ingredients
it's a fantastic video I researched my
face off for that but I'm actually
researching the halo beauty stuff if
possible even more actually a lot more
than I have with the lock seat on and a
big reason why is well there's a couple
of reasons why one that's it's been a
little bit harder to find information
for the halo Beauty stuff just because
it supplements and supplements are kind
of hard to find you know really good
sources on so I've been digging and
digging doing it and I want to make sure
they do a really good job with this
video and I want to do it you know half
I want to go all the way in on it and I
want to make sure this video is legit
and on point and balanced and awesome so
because of that the video may not go up
on Thursday it may go up on Friday
instead just because I want it just
depends on the the quality of what I
think I can put out by Thursday I may
push it you know as far as the filming
of it I may have I may want to look
through the research just a little bit
more and if it takes me longer because I
want to put out a better quality video
then I'm willing to sacrifice my upload
schedule this week to make sure that I
get the the best video out to you
possible because the last thing I want
is to spread any kind of misinformation
there's so much misinformation about the
ingredients out there and I want to make
sure that I have the good stuff for you
so I just want to let you know so if no
video comes out tomorrow just to know
that the halo Beauty video should be
coming out on Friday and then also know
no makeup minute today because of the
field trip I'm going on with my son I
think that everybody should be pretty
cool with me hanging out with my kid
instead of doing the makeup minute this
morning I think we good with that but
yeah that was all I wanted to tell you
and yeah I hope you're having a great
day wherever you are I'm gonna just say
hello one a minute wait I think oh there
we go good morning to Alexis and hashtag
love animals and embrace embrace
curiosity and Lindsay and raychel and
manda and Laura and Karina and Carla and
Adina thank you so much for being here
thank you for watching this on the
replay I appreciate you and mad love to
you and I will see you in a video very
very soon hopefully Thursday if not
while halo beauty on Friday talk to you
soon I'd love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
