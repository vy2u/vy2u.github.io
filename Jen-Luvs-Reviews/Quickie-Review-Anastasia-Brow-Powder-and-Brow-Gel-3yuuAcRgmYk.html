for today and this is a good one my
friends and it is on my Anastasia brow
products these things are ridiculously
expensive it's $30 or something stupid
on these things I can justify it by
saying you know what I'm doing it for
the good of my subscribers this is the
brunette dark brown brow powder and I'll
show you what this looks like and you
may notice these little swipes here
there are a different color and the
reason why that is is because I use this
and this is the Anastasia clear brow gel
it's like a $10 smaller size of it but
when you put this on first and then dip
your brush into the brow powder and then
go back and forth it ruins your brow
powder it doesn't ruin it I can't see it
ruins it but it just dis colors it it's
definitely not a good idea don't do that
like I did basically I do really like
this I don't see how it's any different
than eyeshadow to be completely honest
it does have really nice lasting power
I've had it on since about 7 o'clock
this morning 7:30 this morning and it is
now 935 at night and it still looks
perfect and amazing umm the brow gel it
is very very very wet very wet and I'll
show you I'm gonna put it on I don't
have a monitor so I'm gonna miss my
eyebrow probably but I don't know if you
can see like I'm doing this seriously no
mirror but I don't know if you can see
how shiny that is but it feels very very
wet so overall I really like these two
products I do think that this is
extremely overpriced I think if you get
a long wear eyeshadow it works just as
good and with this I haven't found
anything as good as this but I haven't
tried that many things either there's
gotta be a product that's just as good
at this
that's not as expensive as it is I am
glad that I got the $10 version and not
the $22 version but I have very unruly
brows and this definitely keeps my brows
in place all day long so there you go um
they out mad love I hope you enjoyed
