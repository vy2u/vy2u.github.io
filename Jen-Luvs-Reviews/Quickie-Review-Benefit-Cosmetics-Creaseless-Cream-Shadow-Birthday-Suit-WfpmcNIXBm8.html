for today and this one is on birthday
suit this is a creaseless cream
eyeshadow by Benefit now I had heard
wonderful things about this and I was so
happy to get it now I actually got this
with a gift card from a company called
Expo TV if you have ever heard of
Influenster or buzz agent they send you
free stuff and then ask you to review it
on your social media how Expo TV is
different as if everything is in video
so you watch video reviews such as like
this quickie review that you're watching
they sent me a $20 gift card to Sephora
in order to buy something and then
review it and video so this is what I
chose to get it's a cream shadow and you
can use this as a base or you can use
this just as an all-over lip color I
will swatch that for you it is just a
beautiful champagne it is a very very
very creamy my only complaint about this
is this will not in my opinion be good
for aging lids I felt like it
accentuated any lines or wrinkles that I
have in my eyelids I am starting to get
some wrinkles my eyes definitely do not
look tutorial worthy as far as the
tautness of my eyelids and I would
definitely not recommend this for aging
lids if you seriously my dog is just
peeing on the floor
I gotta go clean that up excuse me sorry
about that we have a new puppy he's 19
weeks old I'll put a picture of him
there he totally just peed on my floor
it happens okay so where was I oak creek
Riesling scream shadow yeah I would not
recommend this for aging lids but that
is my only complaint about it one thing
I love about this that you don't really
get with a lot of cream shadows as it
blends very very nicely in with other
shadows it also does not crease
throughout the day the longevity of this
cream shadow is amazing and again I just
have that one complaint about it but if
you've got younger lids I say rocket go
for girlfriend thank you again to Expo
TV I will put all of their information
down below even if you don't make videos
you can search and watch videos on
products that you are thinking about
buying from real people so that's always
nice they also have
programs kind of like influencer that
you can try to sign up for and then they
send you a product and then you review
it on a video so they have that as well
so if you're interested in any piece of
that click on the links down below and
sign up for Expo TV I hope you enjoyed
that quickie for today if you enjoyed
this video make sure you give it a
thumbs up so that it can get more
exposure here on YouTube make sure you
hit the subscribe button if you would
like to see more reviews by me I try to
put up at least two to three reviews a
week so if you are interested in that
hit the subscribe button and you'll be
notified when I have a new video if that
is the way you have your settings set up
for you too alright thank you for
watching mad love and I will see you in
a video very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
