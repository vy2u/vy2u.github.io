because I feel like I've been such a
negative Nancy in these quickie videos
but I feel the need to warn you so that
you don't buy these terrible products
that I wasted my money on I don't want
you to waste your money and I have
another one for you today yes for you
and it is the benefit sugar bomb first
of all I came with this cute little near
cute little packaging and this
craptastic brush that is so fluffy it
does nothing like it blends like right
into my skin I might as well just be
like a shimmery powder like it's not
even shimmery really I mean it's like a
sheen sheeny sheeny not Charlie Sheen II
but just shiny kind of powder there's
four colors in here but if you swatch
each one individually they all look the
stinking same what's the point of
including four colors at their
alchemists watch the same and then when
you rub them together it does I mean
it's got like a little bit of a coral
tone but not enough to really make you
look like anything
so another craptastic product by benefit
which I love benefit products I love my
hibm I love my they're real mascara this
is not our product I would recommend you
buy if you want a nice blush from
benefit get the coralista I think that
the for my experience the solid color
blushes are better than the ones that
come with the 3 cut with 3 can i count
today with the 4 color so just a
suggestion for you alright I hope you
enjoyed that and make sure you rate
comment and sub and check out my
facebook page at facebook.com slash Jen
Lowe's reviews and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
