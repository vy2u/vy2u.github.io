together to do another taste test and
what do we taste testing today it's made
by fiber one and it's a pro quinoa yay
ok you ready taste it yeah ok and while
she's throwing that away I'll tell you
that the ingredients are roasted peanuts
chicory root extract soy protein isolate
sugar vegetable oil but not hydrogenated
vegetable oil whey protein concentrate
corn syrup rice flour cocoa powder water
vegetable glycerin rice starch on the
glow from toasts oh really go fructose
skim milk toast smell addiction it is
very very very very processed but at
least doesn't have hydrogenated oil and
number one ingredient is roasted peanuts
which is a good thing so you know it
could be worse it could definitely a lot
better for it okay all right right no
cheers it cheers Cheers hmm we think
Thank You camera on the top we're up
here definitely has that protein bar
flavor Mary peanutty chocolate on the
outside is pretty good not as um sweeter
chocolate it's like a chocolate bar
chocolate which is fine with me I act
like the whole thing show you what looks
like on the inside so that's a little
rice krispies in there um it seems like
it to me it tastes like halfway between
a candy bar on a protein bar not sure
seven grams of sugar that's really good
for a candy bar did you find the caramel
no it's this stuff up here so what do
you think about the caramel is there
enough caramel in it kind of yeah I
think I could use more caramel yeah its
overall what you think of this fiber one
chewy protein bar was good if you are
trying to lose
wait or if you were trying to cut down
on your unhealthy foods in your
chocolate addict like me this is a
really nice alternative to that it is
processed this is definitely not the
best food for you but if it's going to
be an evil this is a better evil than
like a Snickers bar which it this
doesn't taste that mean like a Snickers
bar but it's the same kind of idea thank
you for watching bad love and okay my
love I will hear in the next video bye
