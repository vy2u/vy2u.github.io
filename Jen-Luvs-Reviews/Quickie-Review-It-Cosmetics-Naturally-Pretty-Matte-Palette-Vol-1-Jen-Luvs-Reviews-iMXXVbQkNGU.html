for today and today I am doing it on the
it cosmetics naturally pretty palette I
do love this palette for not necessarily
the reason it was intended the idea
behind this palette if you haven't seen
it before is that you have all of these
shades that are matte and this here is
called transforming pearl and what
you're supposed to do is you're supposed
to create your matte look and then put
the transforming pearl wherever you see
fit now with with this for me the
transforming pearl didn't really work
okay I didn't feel like it truly
transformed the shadows into shimmery
shades the way that I feel like the
shimmery shade on its own does it's
almost there but it's not quite but I do
enjoy this as a matte palette sometimes
I'll use this as a highlight and I think
that most people looking at my eyeshadow
would not know the difference between my
shimmery eyeshadows and this on top of
these matte shadows but I notice so
that's enough for me again really really
enjoy this palette love the way that it
they could they apply to my lids I love
the way that they blend I love the way
they blend with my other shadows that I
own you are a matte shadow lover I
definitely would recommend this palette
if you are in the market for some new
neutral matte colors this is just a
gorgeous gorgeous palette and again it
is called the naturally pretty palette
by it cosmetics you can get this at Ulta
online or in store you can also get it
cosmetics calm so thank you so much for
watching I hope you enjoyed this quick
video if you did make sure you give it a
thumbs up and if you want to see more

and I will see you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
