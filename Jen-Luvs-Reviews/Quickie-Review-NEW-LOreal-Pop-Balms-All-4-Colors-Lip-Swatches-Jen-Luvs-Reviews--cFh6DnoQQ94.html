for today and today I'm talking about to
be l'oreal pop all news and these I
found in the Ulta website I have not
seen these in stores yet but I wanted to
mention them because they aren't bring
in a stinking new what I've done for you
as I've done some lip swatches I'm going
to go ahead and show those to you right
now
so the biggest downfall of these is I
found and if my lips are chapped or if I
have like a cut on my lips or like dry
or whatever these things stick to the
thing like crazy like it like sometimes
I let guys dry like right here and it
like made that area stand out like
insanely but if your lips are generally
pretty healthy these things are pretty
amazing the other thing is these are not
for people that like super pigmented lip
products these are for color wimps like
me like people that aren't like really
you know you don't need a ton of color
like I'm wearing a number or a 440
electric pink right now and I really
really like the way that it looks it's
it's enough color that I feel like I'm
wearing a color that's nice and bright
but it's not painted on my lips like you
can still see the texture of my lips
it's not so super bowl that I don't feel
like it's too bright to wear to work I'm
a fourth grade teacher I feel like I can
wear it there when school goes but at
conception and I'm just I'm overall
really really happy with these they're
very moisturizing they don't have a
strong smell they've got like a very
mild
like a vanilla scent but it's very mild
and they feel straight-up like lip balms
bring it up like a lip balm once you eat
something after a couple of hours aware
you are going to need to reapply they do
start wearing where you see you know
that it's wearing in the middle and it's
still there on the outside so this isn't
one you can just let go for the rest of
the day and your lips you're going to
you know fade evenly so keep it in your
pocket or your purse or whatever and or
reapply when necessary or just wipe it
off and you know or put some balm over
it I've done that to put a little bit of
lip balm over and it kind of blends the
color in instead of worrying about
having this just putting lip balm on
will fade it more evenly so just a
suggestion
definitely a positive review thank you
