quickie video for you in forever but
these just came out not too long ago and
I wanted to tell you what I thought of
them and they are the NYX new butter lip
balms I got three of them because I just
wanted to try them out and I want to
just kind of show you some hand swatches
some lip swatches and give you a quick
opinion of them so I got one in panna
cotta that's this one this one is in
ladyfingers and this one is in red
velvet and I'll go ahead and swatch
those for you this is the red velvet
this is the ladyfingers and this is the
panna cotta okay so I want to go ahead
and show you some lip swatches this is
the way my lips look without make sure
it's all off okay yeah yeah yeah so here
is the panna cotta here is ladyfingers
moi and here is red velvet
and I'm going fast because I've had to
shoot this video I'm not even kidding
five tracks these are a lot like a lip
smackers they smell like a lip smackers
they taste like a lip smackers they're
moisturizing with like I'm lip smackers
but they are brine Nicks so I wouldn't
run out and buy these because they're
very exciting but if you're looking for
just a regular ol lip balm with a little
bit of color to it you will probably
like these especially if you are not
used to wearing color on your lips and
you want to try something new to kind of
transition you into wearing a little bit
of lip color these are a good way to
