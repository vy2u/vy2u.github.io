for today and today we will be talking
about the origins a perfect world for
eyes eye cream and this is a firming
moisture treatment with white tea and I
am starting to believe that face creams
do nothing until I found this one
because this one actually does work
would you believe it but there it only
works for my upper lids my upper lids
are definitely more taut it took a few
days for for me to really see the
effects took about a week those days in
between and my eyelids were a little bit
puffy it was kind of strange but not
noticeable to anybody but me but after
about a week I could definitely see less
wrinkles in my upper lids unfortunately
my lower lids like with the little
wrinkly wrinkly sphere and the little
baggy bag is there didn't do anything
for those so I'm still looking for
something that does both if you have any
suggestions put them in the comments
below but overall I am happy with this
eye cream and I would recommend it if
you've got um Rinka wrinkly like light
wrinkles on your eyelids I'm in my mid
30s so and you've got mid 30s looking
eyelids hopefully this will work for you
as good as it did for me alright I hope
you enjoyed that quickie for today mad
love and I'll see you in the next video
I have a product a review down and dirty
review for you of Michael Todd's new you
anti-aging facelift</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
