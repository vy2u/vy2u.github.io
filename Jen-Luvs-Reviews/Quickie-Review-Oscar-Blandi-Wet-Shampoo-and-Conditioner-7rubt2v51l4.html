hello everyone this is a quick demo
ninera view of Oscar Blondie's wet
shampoo and wet conditioner as opposed
to their dry shampoo um alright so
here's the deal with this stuff and they
cost twenty four dollars a piece they
are ridiculously stupid expensive but I
got some of the sample of my from my
sample society box that I got I got some
of this one the shampoo and it was
magical the only complaint about this is
that it smells like lemon pledge not
necessarily the best snow but not
terrible um just household cleaning kind
of smell so I love this so I searched
for it everywhere could not find it
finally found it at Ulta they now have
this so I'm love it volumizing
smoothening smoothening word smoothening
it smoothens my hair very beautifully so
I bought this then at marshalls I found
this for eight dollars a bottle so I
bought three of them so excited to try
the cognition are super excited I go in
the shower and I wash my hair and I put
my conditioner on and then I smell the
snow I'm telling you this stuff is the
worst smelling conditioner i have ever
smelled in my life or two 25-dollar $24
retail price this stuff should smell
beautiful it smells I'm not even kidding
you it's hello cats are you worried
about the smell too they're worried
about stuff because you know what
happened it smells like wet dog I'm not
even joking you put on your hair and
you're like oh oh this is nasty oh
there's a dog in here with me like it's
your smells like dog shampoo it's
disgusting the way it smells but I
sacrifice my nostrils my smelling of the
stuff for the beautifulness that happens
when I use it so I definitely if you can
stand the smell of it I recommend trying
these if you want to pay the obnoxious
price and smell them um smell the awful
awful the little smell of them I hope
you enjoyed your quickie for today mad
love and I will see
