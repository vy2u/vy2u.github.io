your down and dirty review today of
Physicians Formula gel eyeliners and
these are for hazel eyes and just a
little heads up if you ever see products
in the store that are advertised for
certain I types I colors or what it
would be more appropriate please do not
take that to heart if you like the color
buy it I'm a general rule of thumb is if
you have green eyes you don't want green
stuff the blue eyes don't want blue
stuff brown eyes is the only one we get
to get away with pretty much anything
which is kind of cool it's the only
thing about having boring poop color
brown eyes is that we get to wear any
color eyeshadow and pretty much be able
to rock it the hazel I one comes with
black brown and purple and the only
thing about this is you want to make
sure that you have some kind of brush if
you are going to buy these because it
does not come with a brush this one this
brush is enough and gold eyeliner brush
and this is like dollar I think this is
very low quality but it gets the job
done this one is from Sephora and it is
an angled eyeliner brush I think it's a
classic angled eyeliner brush I don't
know it the neighbor of dolphins number
15 this is more of what you're going to
really want to use on at least in my
experience this one's a lot easier to
use now a little bit more about the
product because that's what we're here
to talk about is the product rat rat
okay so this actually was very nice it's
very creamy to go on I haven't used a
whole lot especially the black because I
have better blacks than this but um very
creamy easy to go on I a nice gel liner
does not have good staying power though
you will need to reapply this after a
few hours unfortunately um but it is
very compact so if you do want a less
expensive gel eyeliner and this is very
nice the colors are beautiful they're
very creamy easy to use but the staying
power is not the best I hope you enjoyed
that quick and easy down the dirty
review of Physicians Formula gel
eyeliners mad love and I will see you in
the next video
