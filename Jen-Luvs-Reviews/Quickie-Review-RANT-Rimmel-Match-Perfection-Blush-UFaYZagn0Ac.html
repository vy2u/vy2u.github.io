for today and today I'm going to review
the new Rimmel London remove the the the
new Rimmel London match perfection blush
this is not a good one my friends this
is not a good one if you know my videos
you know how much I love my Rimmel stay
matte it is my holy grail powder and I
was like that is a powder this is a
powder powder powder we will have
success with this and we did not have
success my friends let me show you how
much of a crap product this is okay so
you get the three different colors you
get the bronzing color the blush color
and the lighter guessed powdery color
and I guess you could kind of blend them
together to make your perfect match of
what you're trying to go for but there's
no pigmentation and it is super super
duper powdery I mean just powder City
over here see if I can even show you
these swatches I mean can't you even see
those let me zoom these in okay all
right seriously seriously Rimmel
seriously what is that did you even try
this product before you put it on the
shows really this is a double swatch
okay I don't know how they do it in
London but in the u.s. we like to have
some color when we say something's a
blush we like to make it have color and
my friends in the UK I bet you you can
confirm that people in London do not
like blush like this either
so Rimmel I highly suggest you try your
products and make sure they work before
you do people and trick people into
buying your products that suck it's all
I got to say about that if you enjoyed
this quick video make sure you give it a
big thumbs up make sure you the
subscribe button if you'd like to see
more quickie videos in the future
mad love and I'll see you in a video
very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
