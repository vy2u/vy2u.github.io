down and dirty review of Urban Decay's
and D slick I heard so many good things
about be slick on youtube from all the
beauty gurus oh this looks amazing it
makes your face so mad blah blah blah
yeah for thirty dollars I don't think it
does anything we completely honest at
least for me I don't have super oily
skin at combination skin but it really
doesn't do that much me which makes me
sad because I love Urban Decay like I'm
in love with Urban Decay like it Urban
Decay was a man I would let the in love
with him but but I would not be in love
with his d slick guy is that appropriate
I don't know that's up to you but I you
know whatever so yeah I I wanted to love
this and I don't and it makes him sad i
do use it every day because i spent 30
some dollars on it and I'm gonna use it
gosh darn it because I'm not gonna waste
it and it doesn't do anything bad it
just doesn't do anything good and that's
my issue I hope you enjoyed your quick
fair today mad love and I will see you
in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
