hello my friends welcome to your quickie
review for Tuesday and this is on to
craptastic products from wet and wild
now let me tell you how much I love wet
wild eyeshadows absolutely love them
something like you know what wet and
wild rocks I love their eyeshadows I
love their nail polish so let's try a
couple other things from wet and wild
and it was an ultimate fail and let me
tell you what I got I got first of all
this wet and wild I makeup remover that
burned the crap out of my eyelids I am
NOT even kidding my eyelids felt like
they were on fire I put this stuff on my
eyes and I could not see because i could
not open mustang cat eyes i could not
open them because they were burning so
bad do not buy this it hurts okay i
don't know what did they put this on
their eyes before they put on the show I
don't think they did or else they would
not have done that this stuff hurts it's
painful it's going back to the store
tomorrow but I want to show it to you
first before I returned it the other
thing that was also horribly painful and
totally craptastic was the wet wild mega
eyelet ice cream eyeliner I love cream
eyeliner it is my favorite thing and
this one is in the color eggplant and my
idiot self lost my eyeliner brush after
my 2012 favorites video when I was
showing you stuff my angled eyeliner
brush from Sephora it's gone so I needed
a new eyeliner brush so this one came
with one and I was like oh it's an
angled eyeliner brush it's from wet
mouth so I like wet and wild stuff so it
must be really good and this hurt my
eyeballs okay I put it right here and
it's Scratchy I don't know if you can
hear it can you hear that it's very soft
and when you dig into it let me show you
what happens but look how thick that is
you cannot do this with a thin line and
I try to do it lightly and it just
doesn't work you have to push down on it
to make it work it draws a really thick
line the stuff does not stay on it ends
up really streaky it's horrible okay do
not buy this stuff it's terrible love
wet and wild do not love these two
products all right I hope you enjoyed
your quickie for today mad love and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
