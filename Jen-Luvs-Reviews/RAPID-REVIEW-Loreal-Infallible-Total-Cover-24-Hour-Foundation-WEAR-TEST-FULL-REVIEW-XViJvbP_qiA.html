first rapid review this is going to be a
detailed review in five minutes or less
today we're gonna be talking about the
L'Oreal infallible total cover 24 hour I
have the shade 302 creamy natural this
does come in twelve shades first thing
you need to know about this is it is not
a cruelty free product they do say that
it is made in the United States but some
of the ingredients may have come from
other countries the claims are that it
is a natural finish it wears up to 24
hours high coverage and air lights they
say it's best applied with their Beauty
sponge called the infallible blend
artist it is $12.99 for one ounce that's
the same price as their L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte and the pro glow
24-hour foundations it is a little more
expensive than the Maybelline fit me
foundations and then it's the same price
as the Revlon Colorstay makeup so it's
at the higher end of the drugstore
foundation range as far as price goes at
this point I'm going to show you footage
from my 12-hour wear test so the
application of this foundation it is an
extremely thick foundation the way that
I like to apply it is in two layers
because I feel like it blends better
with one layer and then another layer
over top I did use a flat top kabuki
brush to blend half of my face I wanted
to show you how it looked compared to a
naked one side of my face you can see
that it does have significant coverage
but on the second coat it does build up
a little bit but it never ever ever gets
to full coverage and that's just
something I have not been able to
achieve going onto the second side I am
using the pure minerals blending sponge
I just got this from pure minerals and I
wanted to try it out I do not feel like
this blended the foundation better than
the brush you may notice that I did not
use foundation primer with this because
I have found mixed results with
foundation primers some of them have
allowed the makeup to last a little
longer but most of the foundation
primers I have tried with this have
actually decreased the blend ability of
the foundation so I chose not to use
foundation primer for this look and you
can see
definitely that the side that was
blended with the brush is much better so
this is the look of my foundation with a
full face of makeup so you can see how
the blush and highlighter laid on top of
it oh the other thing is is I did not
use concealer because I didn't want you
thinking that the concealer was
something that the foundation was doing
so I purposely didn't use concealer you
can see it is not seeping into the
wrinkles on my forehead it's not
breaking up on my chin looking pretty
good this is check-in number one this is
after four hours of where I would sit
ripley's believe it or not with my kids
and friends and this is a Nicki Minaj
painting made out of lipsticks that I
thought was cool so so far where is
pretty good except for in-between my
eyes it is definitely breaking up now
this is the eight hour wear test you can
see that it is a fading down still the
brush side looks much better than the
not brush side but you can see that it's
fading significantly on the side that I
used the pure minerals sponge on now all
the way to our 12-hour wear time the
foundation where I blend it with the
Beauty sponge is pretty much completely
gone it's still hanging in there a
little bit with the brush side but still
this is not a 24-hour wear foundation
one thing that I noticed is that the
foundation does not settle into my
wrinkles which I really really like but
definitely definitely not a 24 hour wear
time on this foundation very quickly
we're gonna do a little ingredient
analysis peg cross polymer is an
emollient it's silicone base it is not
safe for injured or damaged skin so if
you have fresh acne that may be open or
any kind of cuts on your face please do
not use this foundation phenoxyethanol
which is a preservative that can be a
skin irritant there's also one that I
cannot pronounce its pH adjusting it is
an allergen and it can be acne causing
for some people the next want to sell a
silic acid it's an acne treatment
typically it's also used as a
preservative it can increase your sun
sensitivity so make sure that you are
wearing a sunscreen if you go out into
the Sun using this foundation also that
ingredient should not be applied to the
eyes or lips so be very careful not to
put it on your lips I did put it on my
lips during the demo because I didn't
realize that when
I did the demo but I will not be putting
it on my lips ever again my final
thoughts on this as it is a very
mediocre foundation it's very thick but
it does not go on full coverage the
lasting time on it is not great and I
honestly wouldn't recommend this for
thirteen dollars if this was a six
dollar foundation I'd say yeah sure go
for it go ahead nice lighter coverage it
doesn't live up to the claims and it's
honestly very disappointing to me it's
not a bad foundation it just doesn't
love to live up to the claims and it's
not a good foundation I want to thank
you so much for watching this video I
