working okay right now I already see my
lips lagging a little bit we just had a
very short live stream of just a quick
yet my lips are already lagging so I'm
gonna go ahead and sign off again one
more time and we're just gonna go to the
regular webcam until I can figure this
out so let me sign off and then I'll be
back in a second hold on okay so we're
just gonna go back to old school let me
wipe off my lens here it's all foggy
looking it doesn't look nearly as good
as it did a minute ago if you are
watching this on the replay I know this
is like really confusing I'm trying to
get the audio to sync up with the video
and the problem was in the stream I did
a moment ago the audio wasn't syncing up
I have a webcam and I think that the
streaming is a little too intense for
live-streaming like it's for whatever
reason something isn't keeping up the
quality being transferred out isn't as
good a quality like it's it's just
enough that it can't keep up with my
webcam so the audio was out of sync so
and I want you to be able to hear me
like the quality of the video is just
gonna have to go down a little bit till
I can figure this out
so I even see my lips are still not
quite where they should be so I
apologize but I do want to keep going
with this video because it's it's a
topic I want to talk about and it's
making me sad that this is taking me so
long to to get started so thank you guys
so much for being here if you're here
watching live thank you for your
patience I really appreciate it now
let's go ahead and get into the topic so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna talk
about the YouTube beauty space things we
love things we hate things we wish would
change things that we want to stay the
same all of that and again I apologize
that the quality went back down to
normal poop cuz I'm back to being yellow
and fuzzy and I you know I'll work on it
work on it so if you're watching this on
the replay you're probably pretty
confused hopefully you've figured out at
this point what's going on and we can
just chat now so what I wanted to start
talking about
is you know the things that I feel like
are going right on YouTube I feel like
there's a lot of things that are going
well and there's a lot of channels right
now that I feel like are kind of
changing the game and are you know are
really bringing a new fresh outlook to
YouTube beauty and I think that that's
really important some of the larger
channels I feel like we're getting
really comfortable in doing the same
thing because it's working for them and
and that's great for them I think it's
great that it's working for them but as
far as the the channels that aren't the
biggest channels I feel like we need to
start getting a little bit more creative
as far as the content that we're putting
up so that it's not excuse me it's not
the same thing over and over and over
and over again and seeing the same
things and I think that's why a lot of
channels people are unsubscribing people
aren't watching anymore it's you know
how many times can I see you know the
same thing over and over again so real
quick I just want to give Angelica
another quick shout-out just because
this video was inspired by her video of
I'll spell her name it's a &amp;amp; GTL I see a
NY q vis T is her channel I've just been
absolutely loving it but she did a video
recently on reasons why she unsubscribe
from YouTube channels and I found it to
be very insightful and I really enjoyed
it and I just enjoy Angelica's
perspective on pretty much everything
and she's incredible with tutorials
she's an excellent review where I
definitely recommend you check out her
channel so oh is Angelica here ah is she
actually heard that would be so cool if
Angelica's here she shows up sometimes
so but anyway yeah so so I feel like you
know there's like someone's mentioning
right now fbh oh by the way I heard that
you're gonna be able to you're gonna be
able to see the chat on the side but I'm
still gonna do this the way I normally
do tell you you know who I'm talking to
fe h 16 says what's finally going right
is raw beauty christy is finally getting
the recognition she deserves lots of
small youtubers are growing and it makes
me so happy yes and I feel like Christy
is one of those examples of somebody
that's trying to do something different
and that was the game-changer for
Christy and when she just embraced her
her she's so funny she's so funny and
she's so smart and she's she's an
excellent review where she cares about
giving good information and I think that
that's that's something that's really
good on YouTube right now is there are a
lot of youtubers coming up like that you
know we've got Georgia Harris and makeup
struggles and you know who else I mean
just so many really really good channels
that are coming out right now you know
that are starting to come up and it's
just it's wonderful to see that tail up
Taylor that Tayla she does a lot of
really good foundation reviews that's
kind of her thing but she does a lot of
other reviews as well she's amazing
but but yeah I mean I think that there's
definitely you know a group of people
that are trying to do something a little
bit different and it's so nice to see
it's so nice to see Nadine says I think
what Taylor is doing with Project Beauty
sharing or 15 days of foundation series
is incredible I agree I mean she's just
such a nice nice person I just I love
her absolutely adore her
Samantha March absolutely hot mess mama
absolutely these are all really great
channels lúcia temper beauty I just
recently discovered her in my suggested
feed and I was very impressed with her
perspectives actually it's funny because
I watched her video and I was like this
is kind of what I said in my Jacqueline
Hill video just not as articulately new
Jacqueline home video they got so much
crap for it was pretty much what I was
saying was what she said she just said
it in a lot better way than I did in a
better format but I agreed with her so
much and I was so excited to see her and
that she's doing so well Allyson said
for me it's that the genuine channels
that I can connect with people being
real exactly exactly
totally agree Liv loves her makeup yep
another great channel a lot of honesty
they're very thorough definitely Mimi
says do creators want feedback why some
my subscribers are unsubscribing there
is someone I watch but I can't anymore
because everything is her favorite
enemies
I don't know if she is brand pleasing
she might be and you know I think you're
just going to term brand pleasing and I
think that's one of the big problems on
YouTube is bread pleasing and you know
you can I give you credit Mimi Mimi has
coined a term unless she heard it from
someone else I think that's a big
problem you know like for example you
know perfusion sent me this stuff and
you know I want perfusion this is me
brand pleasing I want perfusion to
continue to send me things so that I can
review them and get lots of views so I'm
going to tell you how amazing this is
even though it's I'm there may be things
I don't like about it but I'm going to
conveniently omit the things I don't
like about it and I'm just gonna focus
on the things that I do like about it I
feel like you know that there isn't
necessarily a lie there but there's a
lot of omission there's a lot of
omission because you can't love
everything and there's no way there's no
way you love everything it drives me
bonkers I mean and this is let me just
disclaimer this real quick this is my
personal opinion and I said this in the
other video before the livestream messed
up with the the you know the sinking I'm
a human being that has a right to an
opinion and for some reason there's a
select group of people that believe that
once you get at a YouTube audience that
you no longer have a right to have an
opinion and then you got it you know
just keep your mouth shut about things
and you can't talk about things that you
feel and believe anymore and that drives
me insane I have I have a right to an
opinion I'm a human being so this is all
about my opinion I'm not telling you if
you disagree with me that you're wrong
we are it's okay to disagree but this is
my opinion and I have a right to have it
so there okay so anyway the brand
pleasing thing really drives me bonkers
and it's very easy to spot okay so what
you're gonna do is you're gonna watch
the video and then you're gonna see if
they say anything negative okay if it's
a 100 percent glowing review fine and
watch their next video another hundred
percent glowing review okay red flag
third video 100% glowing review okay at
that point I unsubscribe that's
something I can't even I cannot even
drives me insane I lost Angelica's
comment I was going to read it where did
it go no I lost it it was marked as spam
there it is and then it disappeared
again are you kidding me
it was marked as spam and I unmarked it
as spam and then it disappeared I lost
it darn
okay so but anyway Steph says just tell
us what you're being paid that's all I
ask
yeah I mean if people are being paid for
a review I feel like there's a lot of
people that are there still aren't
disclosing sponsored content you know
like I know that how much money I can
get for a video which I don't want to
disclose it's just I'm not comfortable
telling you exactly how much money I get
paid from a brand just because I don't
want other brands to know what I get
paid from certain brands and like I just
feel like that's kind of tacky for me to
disclose that because I feel like that's
private between me and the brand brand
chalica says I'm spam you're not though
you're fabulous
but at my size knowing what I get
there's no way some of these bigger
youtubers are not getting paid for some
of this content I mean there's there's
no way their hats I have no evidence I
have no receipts I have no proof all I
have is my gut feeling on that but just
drives me bonkers that they don't
disclose it it's like if you're getting
paid fine just just say you're getting
paid for it and say you know this is
this is a sponsored video but I'm still
gonna give my honest review they just
get so much crap for it so I can see why
they you know want to hide it because
they don't want people to think that
they're not being genuine but then
you're shooting yourself in the foot
drives me crazy um another mention of
Risa does make up our is a oh my gosh
such a great channel totally agree she
also she's also honest and does a lot of
mature skin yes Claire says I'm
patiently waiting for Emily Noel to
reach 1 million subs I don't know why
Emily hasn't gotten a million it doesn't
make any sense to me why Emily Noel
eighty-three isn't at a million
subscribers I don't get it
I really don't I mean there's some sub
channels I just shake my head and I go I
don't get it I just don't get why she
doesn't have a million subscribers I
don't it makes no sense to me
makes no sense
lisa says when you anti anything is the
truth the only thing about okay so
there's the flip side of this that i
wanted to talk about is that sometimes
people will in authentically bash a
product as well because of the shock
value for views so be careful of that as
well that someone is telling you they've
got you know this blush palette and
they're putting it on and they put on
like this and they go oh my gosh it's so
horrible oh my gosh I can't even get it
to blend but they've barely touched
their face oh my gosh this is terrible
let's try different color oh my gosh
it's horrible this is terrible oh my
gosh I can't even use this thing
how are they even charging money for
this blah blah blah I mean I'm just
using it as an example it's just that
you got to be careful of that too and
then let me make sure I'm clear on this
this is not just with big big people
with lots of followers this is people
with small followings too because people
that have small followings want a brand
please because they want to continue
it's really important for them to
continue getting PR I mean can you
imagine if you're at you know 5,000
followers and you get a package from Too
Faced oh my gosh you're gonna freak out
you don't want to face to take you off
the pr list this is your oh my gosh like
yeah so be careful smaller channels too
it's not just big channels it's small
channels too
absolutely I mean the brand pleasing in
the brand bashing both are just equally
as bad what we really want as a
community what I want not we because I
can only speak for myself
it's just honesty just just try it try
the product for a decent length of time
meaning at least twice before you say
it's approved before you say that it's
amazing try it at least twice you wear
it all day at least once at least and
then tell us your opinion but don't slap
it on your face and then say this is
amazing you need to go buy this you need
to purchase it it drives me absolutely
insane in say I can't even stand it
joyful beauty channel says I have a very
I'm a very small channel and I was zero
desire to put a brand please it's really
I mean I
to tell you it was really hard for me in
the beginning not to brand please and I
do feel like sometimes back when I first
started getting PR I did brand please
some where I was a little more gentle
than I think I probably should have been
because I was you know I don't know I
guess it's like when you invite someone
into your house and then you rip them to
shreds thing you know like that's just
rude like I was trying not to be rude
but it's not rude it's not and I had to
beat that into my own head and Emily was
a big and Emily Noel I III was a big
inspiration for that I've told the story
like a million times where she I watched
a video of hers and she had gotten some
to face brushes and she said they
weren't very good and I was like if she
can do this I can do this you know but
this was like way back at the beginning
on my channel but I am definitely guilty
of brand pleasing when I first started
getting PR and and it was more of it
wasn't that I lied about it it was just
that I only said the positives and
omitted the negatives which is
definitely a big no-no for me big no-no
but I was guilty of it myself so I have
no right to judge anybody else there we
go um doll face says every youtuber said
the subculture palette was trashed but
the colors were so beautiful so I bought
it in the palette is amazing and I think
the subculture was one of those things
where I don't think people gave it
enough of a chance before they did their
reviews I really don't I think that you
know there was a lot of bandwagoning for
that product specifically I feel like
the k'kaw Beauty launch was another one
where it was the opposite where I feel
like people just slapped it on their
face and no Fenty the fancy Beauty
launch not k'kaw the fenty Beauty launch
k'kaw to a little bit but the Fendi
Beauty launch I feel like people slapped
it on their face and approved it in
about five seconds and it was like I was
so irritated by a lot of those begetting
Fenty Beauty reviews I mean Rihanna can
take it I'm sure she can you know it's
like I don't know it just drove me
insane and then the subculture with the
bashing of it and just oh my gosh I just
can't even I just be honest just think
about it and realize that you as an
influencer have a responsibility to your
audience to give accurate information
it's not about giving positive negative
it's about giving accurate information
to your own personal experience and the
only way to do that is to really think
about what you're doing while you're
doing it and those youtubers that are
doing that I think are going to do very
very well you know the Angelico's of the
world are going to do very very well as
long as the audience shows channels like
Angelica's and Christie's and all of
these other channels as long as they
show those those videos loved by
watching good they're here's the problem
is that that you know the viewers are
the ones you know you say you shop with
your dollar like you support with your
dollar on YouTube you're supporting with
your views so what we need to do as a
community is if we value something if
you value something no matter what it is
whatever it is you value you need to
watch videos that also have those same
values and support that way if you're
watching channels that you know are
shady
then that's just helping those channels
to succeed so finding those channels
that you personally identify with and
appreciate and making sure to watch
their content I think that's the best
way we as a community can increase the
positivity and the the good quality
content you know and it's not just in
beauty it's everywhere I mean the Logan
Paul's of the world you know people are
watching it that's why it keeps doing it
you know what I mean
more questions about Tottie's vitamins
we will I will do an entire in-depth
video on Tati's vitamins I don't want to
go into it right now because I'm not
done with my video and I want to be
thorough I am NOT just going to slap up
some crap googling of like for like 15
minutes I'm not I'm not throwing it up
there I'm not I'm gonna I'm gonna do my
due diligence and the video is gonna be
up not this coming week but the
following week is where my goal is to
put that video up as I want to make sure
that that I put in the time and the
energy to make sure I have the most
accurate information possible I have a
lot of followers on Twitter that are in
the professional field that I'm going to
kind of tap into but I don't know them
personally so I'm also going to talk to
medical
doctors that I know and get some
information from them that have nothing
to do with the beauty community so yeah
I mean I'm gonna I'm gonna make sure
that I give the best information
possible on that Jacqueline says Jackie
Anna does a beautiful halo eye using
subculture I watched her and Stephanie
Nicole's reviews and I think it also
comes down to talent and knowledge I
think that's part of it too and I think
that it's also playing with it you know
when you have a product making sure that
you don't just do one look and then
approve or disapprove because in one
look how many shades can you use in one
look out of a 14 shade palette you know
you're gonna use maybe five six seven
half the palette that's not enough for a
full review in my opinion I'm at least a
thorough review I mean first impression
reviews if you say it's a first
impression review I have no problem with
that I do first impression reviews every
once a while especially on livestream
but you know I think it's important to
try things so anyway let's move on to a
different topic so let's talk about I
don't know what should we talk about
what else bugs us and what else do we
love about YouTube Beauty I personally
love to be able to get information and
be able to Google search and search and
find a product that I'm interested in
ahead of time before I buy something I
think it's great I think YouTube is a
great resource it's just making sure to
know who you trust
Oh Terry Lee is here hi Terri Lee how
are you Steph says the box of crayons
palette has me scared straight if you
don't know I did do a full review of the
color the item said Colerain the crayon
case is box of crayons palette and one
thing I think that's really important to
understand about my knowledge of that is
I just have a lot of questions and my
questions are kind of freaky that I
don't know the answers to these and
they're not responding to me as far as
giving the answers as far as you know
the them not being on pitas website but
having the PETA Bunny and I was recently
educated by a subscriber that to get
PETA certification all you need to do is
log I was wrong on this all you need you
to get PETA certification is to log on
to their you know approval process or
whatever and say and promise basically
that you're gonna be cruelty-free off to
prove anything so Peter certification
actually isn't that difficult to get
it's the logical harmony and what's the
other one that leaping bunny is the one
that's very difficult to get that you
have to work really hard and that was
what I was thinking of that I referenced
in the video review was that but just
the fact that they have the peanut bunny
on them and they're not listed on PETA
kind of sketches me out but I don't know
maybe they went through the process of
it I don't know they won't answer me
and then you know the thing about the
eye shadow with the eye that maybe
that's not I safe I did have a
subscriber that they did respond to that
person and they sign oh we're off topic
now I just realized that sorry but I was
dipped through this real quick somebody
said that they did respond to them on
Instagram I saw their response and they
said if they were just trying to be
creative that the eye shadow thing was
just a creativity thing and has nothing
to do with the eye shadows being I safe
or not and I wish they had responded
that to me because I still haven't heard
a single thing from them you know and
then the misspellings on the eyeshadow
primer ingredients I mean it's just
questions I have no evidence there's
anything wrong with this brand I have no
evidence that there's anything that's
bad about this brand I just have
questions and they're not answering me
so you know Mia says is there a way to
find youtubers on specific areas ie
there are products on the west coast
they're not available in the East Coast
I would just imagine that you would want
to just find creators that are on
whatever coasts you live on it's the
same thing with you know products in
Australia and the UK you're just gonna
have to fund I mean I don't think
there's any resource that points out
where people live unfortunately I mean
as far unfortunately it not where they
actually live we're not talking at
daxing here but we're you know which
coast they live on or which area they
live in to you know find that out let's
see
shann says I'm tired of creators doing
sponsor videos for companies that have
well-documented issues of treating their
customers like crap and having bad
policies do you have a specific example
of that chan because I'm trying to think
of a brand like that I can't think of
any off the top of my head I mean like
Lime Crime has had issues but I don't
really see a lot of sponsored content
what Shauna says but I love accents
Jenny I know right
Karen says is a connector and endorsed
by the actual Crayola brand no Karen
that eyeshadow palette is not endorsed
by that brand by Crayola but they don't
have to be because crayon is not
copyrighted Oh fan of a-- okay
everybody's talking about fashion Emma
yeah I mean I think that that's
something that people need to keep in
you know keep in mind fashion Nova has
never reached out to me I have purchased
sand things from fashion OVA personally
before it blew up on YouTube I do have
some fashion ova stuff and I didn't have
a problem with my particular order
julius places another brand i haven't
had any personal problems with but i've
heard other people have had problems
with it so i think it's one of those
things that's really hard as a creator
to you know when you haven't had a
negative experience but other people
have i think leaving that disclaimer i
think is important but i don't know
about not doing sponsored content if
you've never had a bad experience but i
think maybe that should be mentioned at
least in the video description i know
christie had some bad experiences with
them Robbie to Christie had some bad
experiences with with fashion nova
joyful beauty channel says okay i'm
going back to work alright bye Robin
says oops I meant the first up wait a
minute well Steph says fashion OVA is
the worst they take your money for out
of stock items and then only give you
credit forcing you to spend the money on
items you don't even want um just for
fun my money yeah that's what I learned
from Christie's video but um and
stephanie says I heard Kylie has
terrible customer service I heard that
as well I heard that as well Erica says
smoulder cosmetics I've never heard of
them have you ever she wants to just
wants to know more about them Marilyn
says it annoys me how much PR company
can send one youtuber who whole sets
colors even personalize massive
packaging also taking them to exotic
places etc and this is the way I kind of
feel about PR trips I have no problem
with PR trips as long as the youtuber or
Instagram or whoever kind of you know
understanding that it's it's almost like
you know am I on the dentist door how
it's got that no soliciting little thing
on there you know I mean everybody
anybody that has a business gets
solicited for free products you know
doctor
and dentists and you know computer
companies and you know everybody my
husband gets it at his tattoo studio
people trying to give free product in
order to you know promote their stuff
and try to get that business to use it
and I think that PR is the same thing I
mean I think PR has been happening way
before YouTube you know they would send
PR to magazines and to you know
television shows and things like that
you know Good Morning America you know
you get a goodie bag from whatever
company you know to try to get people to
use it and enjoy it so PR is nothing new
it's just how you let it influence your
reviews and and it kind of reminds me of
teaching and I'll you'll hear me say
this again at some point or another but
when I was teaching my students let's
say they had a bad morning and they got
in an argument with their mom or let's
say it's their birthday today and
they're going to be celebrating their
birthday later you know and they're so
exciting they can't even focus in school
I would say you know Johnny I know what
your birthday today I don't know you're
really excited but I want you to take
that out of your head just imagine you
know everything you're excited about
take it out of your brain for a minute
put it on a shelf save it for later and
then let's let's focus on what we're
supposed to be focusing on now and I
think that's what YouTube beauty
creators you do that's what I personally
do when I receive PR is yes I know I got
this for free yes I know this brand is
doing a sponsored video yes I've never
been on PR trip but yes I I know this
brand is taking me on you know to Bali
or whatever but I'm gonna take that out
of my head I'm gonna put on a shelf I'm
gonna save it for later and I'm gonna
focus on what this product is all about
and that's just the way that I think of
things and I think that's what we need
to do was reviewers with PR and trips
and all that but are people actually
doing that are people you know being
influenced by all of this that's the
question what grades did I teach I
mostly taught fourth in fifth grade but
I taught at some point I taught K
through five at some point or another
Nash law says I hate watching PR trips I
kind of like it just because I like
seeing you know people having fun and
enjoying themselves I think it just
depends Nancy says but PR trips cost
money for someone I bet the end of the
it is the customer the consumer and
that's possible but they they have a
budget you know the every every company
has a budget and a budget for PR meaning
commercials magazine ads it used to be
spending all this money in magazine ads
and television commercials and things
like that so instead of doing a magazine
ad or television commercial they're now
doing brand trips and things like that
with influencers it's just the movement
of money so like for brands that have
been around since before YouTube it's I
believe in my heart I have no no
receipts for this but I believe that
they've always had a budget for
advertising and that's all it is that's
really all it is
lash love says I unsubscribe from money
because of PR trips I don't unsubscribe
because of PR trips I don't unsubscribe
because of sponsored video content I
unsubscribe when when the content is
different when the content changes when
when I see that someone is being solved
in that that's when I unsubscribe and
it's not just from one video it's from
multiple videos I usually try to give
the benefit of the doubt
off of you know there's been creators
that I'm still subscribed to that I
still really like that I've watched a
video and kind of went this isn't really
a very good video this isn't a good
review I I don't like this but I don't
unsubscribe immediately I wait and I
watch one or two more videos and if they
can win me back like I'm like alright
cool but I always have it in the back of
my head like you know what I mean Sammy
says I unsubscribe button becomes fake
yeah absolutely
Jane says I heard that YouTube is cheap
advertising to their market audience
absolutely I mean I don't have the
numbers but if you think about how much
an ad in a magazine is gonna cost versus
you know sending out PR to an influencer
I mean if you're just sending the
package without it being a sponsored
video you know what's that gonna cost
you I mean in product and in you know in
shipping 50 bucks 100 bucks something
like that but if you were going to put
an ad in a magazine that's thousands and
thousands and thousands dollars and
people are starting to take notice of
smaller influencers too you should see
soon that
smaller influencers are getting more PR
and the reason why is because it's
cheaper if you send let's say I send
someone with three million subscribers I
do a sponsored video that's gonna cost
me probably thousands of dollars to do a
sponsored video on a large channel but
the purchase rate on larger channels is
actually smaller than it is on smaller
channels because the Trust isn't there
as much in the larger channels they
don't have they don't typically have as
much engagement and Trust typically this
is from an article that I read I'll have
to see if I can find it and link it
below but the the turnover rate on
purchases doesn't seem to be according
to this article that I read as high on
larger channels as it does on smaller
channels so let's say you have a group
of channels that are between 50 and a
hundred thousand subscribers and you
send out you you can either spend
thousands of dollars just to send it to
one person or you can spend thousands of
dollars to send it to a hundred people
and these people are going to be so
excited to get PR to get that there
they're more likely to give a positive
review without trying to brand please
and you didn't have to pay they're gonna
make the video because they don't get PR
so they're more likely to make an actual
video and put their love in a heart and
soul into this video and their audience
because they're smaller they're gonna be
more trusting and they're gonna be more
likely to purchase so that's why there's
gonna you're gonna start seeing I think
we're already seeing a little bit of a
shift with sending PR to smaller
influencers versus the larger influence
I mean the larger influencers are still
getting a ton of PR but you're starting
to see smaller influencers getting more
which i think is great we just need to
make sure that we're still keeping our
integrity in that yeah I will try Devin
to find that article and put it down
below I can't remember if I retweeted it
or not if I retweeted it it's gonna be
really easy to find but I have to can't
remember how I got it's something about
micro influencers the rise of micro
influencers Emily says the bigger the
company the less impact one person has
if someone complains about say covergirl
then they'll ignore you unless you have
some giant influence it you don't matter
and I think that there's part of it
unless you are actually selling the
product for them if you have an audience
of you know 50,000 people and you've now
sold 6,000 units
I mean and they own they didn't have to
pay you anything versus they had to pay
thousands of dollars to sell you know
ten thousand units you know what I mean
oh wait where'd you Shan go because I -
Shan a question and I don't know whether
we answered that she says I've been
watching a certain youtuber since she
had a Bible subscride bible scriptures
in her outro but it's just not the same
anymore she is entertaining but I don't
trust 50 percent of what she says got it
makeup junkie says I saw someone with
less than six hundred subscribers get
Anasazi PR honest Asya gives out PR to
people the really small channels
sometimes I am NOT Anasazi see our list
and that's okay with me it's totally
cool I've said it before and I'll say it
again I do not mind buying products the
only thing that it hurts me not getting
PR is because I am so thorough it takes
me a really long time to get videos out
so like my Dominique Cosmetics palette
I've worn it four times I think but I
haven't started filming the video yet so
I'm filming the video this coming
weekend and hopefully it'll be out the
following week after that but it gives
people a jump start a head start and
especially if you're gonna do a first
impression review like you can slap that
stuff on your face and have it up the
next day as a review if you get it in PR
it's not about getting the free product
at that point it's about getting the
exposure but I like I don't have any
problem not being on a PR list if
because I feel like my my audience
doesn't mind waiting for a review
because they know that I'm going to be
giving them good solid information I
feel like the majority of my audience is
cool with that which is fine with me
Katie says anyone remember in the big
youtuber who was whining because she
didn't get free on Stasi OPR
I don't know that example but I wouldn't
be surprised if that did happen Stef
says whining isn't cute I agree I think
you know I feel like sometimes people
are really harsh on influencers and blow
things up I think sometimes someone just
has a complaint and then it's blown up
into this huge thing that they're
whining and crying and all this stuff I
think that one thing we need to do as an
audience is not blow things out of
proportion when it comes to what an
influencer says and I've had this happen
to me where I'll say you know what I
don't really like this and the next
thing I know everybody's jen is whining
and complaining you know Zevon it's like
all I said was I don't really like it
like let's let's bring it down a notch
okay let's bring it down a notch and
actually talk about you know what what
is actually happening you know and not
blowing things out of proportion I'm not
gonna say me it's y'all can say names
all you want but I'm not gonna say names
cuz that's just bad form it's bad form
Tara says I don't think PR is a problem
but I get sick of seeing these huge
unboxing and youtubers seem so
ungrateful
I think the ungratefulness really
bothers me there was a youtuber that I
watched awhile back that had gotten a
boxycharm and oh my gosh like boxycharm
has been sending you back to trim for a
long long time I know the CEO I can
email him at any time and you know I've
had concerns and I've emailed him and
he's gotten back to me within I'm not
even kidding you within 30 minutes he's
back to me so you know it when I saw
this person unbox this box eat ramen
opened it up and like what is that so
that's a subscription box oblong mm-hmm
throwing stuff and through the box I was
like that was not nice no like that
really bothered me so much like at least
take the time and show it and say thank
you like when I did the perfusion a
minute ago like even though I know that
I have so much perfusion right now that
I need to try what they've already sent
me I know this stuff is gonna go and
forgive away I'm still very appreciative
because I know that when I do give this
away somebody is going to be very very
thankful for it and I am excited about
the mixed metal
peach palate thing because I've never
tried their metallic formula I showed
this in the other video but I've never
tried the metallic formula and actually
quite it's pretty excited to try that
but yeah that just that bothers me too
when when people are just very
dismissive of the P R it's like oh I got
this I'll throw it it almost reminds me
of like a six year old at Christmas when
they get socks you know and they're like
oh it's socks oh it's a t-shirt
yeah it's underwear but instead it's
like a lemare cream oh my gosh another
person that I watched they had gotten
this was before Vizio art was really big
they got in a busy art palate and they
were like what is this oh and they just
like threw it on their bed I was like
that's baby I shadow Belen you just
threw it on your bed like it didn't even
matter like what you know it bothered me
so much oh my gosh Michelle said Todd oh
I'm talking about Tati
okay I'm not I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
do it I'm not gonna do it Emily says but
the difference is a grown adult who
knows better yeah absolutely totally
agree if by the way if I'm not seeing
your comment and I'm not commenting back
it's not because I don't care it's just
because there's so much coming through
Katie says I just watched my smaller
youtube channel with only fourteen
thousand subs get her first PR package
and she reviewed it honestly and my view
nice what was the channel Katie it was
great to see and she was um she was
grateful and wait she was grateful
instead of a huge PR hole unboxing yeah
absolutely Mimi says I want socks for
Christmas
I don't want socks for Christmas but if
I get socks I'll send them to you Mimi a
Vaughn says drama channels are just
waiting for a comment so they have
something to talk about absolutely
absolutely and there are like I will
tell you I do watch a few drama channels
i watch t spill I watch here for the tea
I watch Peterman and I watch rich Lux
those are the ones that I watch I don't
watch any other ones because I feel like
yes they're spilling tea but I feel like
they're at least in my view so far as of
up to here they at least try oh and
Beauty truth sleuth
that's the other one at least they're
trying to give valid information instead
of just trying to stir things up I think
some some drama channels their whole
purpose is just to make people upset and
they'll blow everything out of
proportion just to make people upset and
I don't like that
and I do not watch those exposed expose
expose expose p'tee school has the best
editing I need like editing classes from
T spill really good as far as the
editing yeah and they cover all the
angles and one thing I appreciate from
here from with here for the T is she
doesn't seem to be biased for or against
the influencers you know it's not like
she's always anti influencer like a lot
of drama channels or sometimes she'll
actually stand up for the influencer and
say you know what even though blah blah
blah I think that they're right in this
situation you know I appreciate that a
lot
Tara babies oh my gosh I love Tara mover
I love Tara I wish that she did more
reviews and less halls though she does
so many halls so many halls tani
michelle has a good drama channel I
don't know tawny Michelle rich Lux is
the only one worth watching here for the
tea is pretty vile to people on Twitter
and you know really is she I haven't
seen that I follow her on Twitter but I
haven't seen that good to know but
anyway I feel like the most important
thing in anything as far as YouTube
getting back to the topic as far as you
know YouTube any kind of video on
YouTube is just being honest about what
you're presenting you know and not not
spreading lies not spreading rumors that
aren't true I feel like that's a lot
what's happening right now with Tottie's
supplements is that people are doing
quick google searches and this is what I
learned and this will be in my video
when I do the full video on takis
vitamins is that I learned early on I
want to start researching ingredients
this is really important I learned that
there's a website called ewg
environmental working group and I used
to use that as a major source for my my
videos for ingredient analysis and then
I learned that what what ewg does is
they will like let's say it's talc
they'll look at
this might not be the best example but
they'll look at studies that were
straight talc in a high concentration
put on your nether regions and then
though report on it but the interaction
between talc and your nether regions is
quite different and then talc
on your eyes there are some people that
have an allergic reaction to tell on
their eyes but for the majority of
people tell there isn't a lot of
evidence that says talc is bad for your
eyes in any way except for if you
specifically have an allergic reaction
to it but ewg will tell you that it's
like the worst thing ever because it's
basing on a study that has nothing to do
with cosmetics it's really important
when we research any kind of ingredients
that we dig a little bit deeper other
than there was a study once that said
that this does this you have to look at
the dosage you have to look at who it
was given - you have to give it a look
at how many people it was given - what
were the conditions under which it was
given was it given to humans was it
given to animals there's a lot of
factors so just you know seeing
somewhere that this ingredient does this
is not enough there you have to find out
more about that particular study to find
out you know oh and also the
interactions especially in like the
vitamin the interactions between the
things that are in the vitamin because
you know one thing plus this thing may
cause something different it's like you
know you got a red and a yellow there
there one thing separate but when you
put them together they make orange it's
it's the same thing from what I'm
learning with vitamins sometimes
separately they do something but when
you put them together it does something
a little bit different so that could be
a good thing or a bad thing but that
needs to be considered you know what I
mean and I think there's a lot of people
just throwing information up without
considering any of that and that's what
drives me insane about it Alise says ewg
is all risk assessment your 100% of the
money with this yeah absolutely and I
think that it's really really important
to take into consideration a lot of
factors so with with with like the
vitamins with any kind of ingredient
research you've got to make sure that
you're using legitimate sources PopSugar
is not a legitimate source and you need
if the pot if you're reading a pop sugar
article about something you know looking
to see
where did they get their information do
they get it from a study and if they did
get from a study what was that study
about people are don't have time to
research all that so they'll read a
PopSugar article and they'll just go
with it okay
also if the company sells that
particular product you've got to take it
with a grain of salt so if you have a
vitamin company that's telling you that
this particular vitamin ingredient does
X Y &amp;amp; Z well they're probably trying to
sell you vitamins you know what do you
mean you can't really trust that from a
vitamin company because they're they've
got an angle you know I mean it's the
same thing with cosmetics so I think
it's really really important to dig
deeper than that so that's what I'm
that's what I'm doing is digging deeper
I think that's very important
so sabi says I totally agree how do you
feel about her statement about the video
in the video about ceramide rx being the
most expensive and that is made by the
company of James is a part owner from
we're gonna dig all the way into that I
actually talked to talked to you about
that
so I do have information about that but
I want I know Tottie's coming out with a
video on Monday so so she's probably
going to explain that in that video but
it is it's it's I don't want to tell her
story for her but I am gonna that is
going to be part of my video when I
release it in about a week ish but
definitely talk to your doctor before
ingesting any kind of vitamins
absolutely manifest mu says I think I
did not care for the gossip one so I cut
them out
I like connecting with people it feels
more real like a disconnect I'm not sure
oh you tell me like the gossip channels
yeah I hear you I know that it's 11:04
but I did come on late so we're gonna
stay for the full hour Emily says Jen
how do I contact you with research for
information if Twitter is a really good
place or you can send me an email at Jen
loves reviews at gmail.com spelled the
same way as my channel je + lu vs
reviews at gmail.com
oh my gosh is Sam here from here for the
team that'd be really funny it's just
talking about Sam let's see what else
people talking about but anyway so what
else do I love and hate about YouTube
videos
I think the inauthenticity and the lack
of research drives me insane yeah I
think that that's the big thing like
when Angelica did her video about you
know what she what she lund subscribe
from I think when I when I realized that
the channel is either being lazy with
their content in that they are not
they're just slapping it on their face
and recommending something it's like
that bugs me so yes Sam is here cool hi
Sam
but I thought God I think is my big
unsubscribe and also wet like Angelica
said I feel like when when the come and
the content gets stale when they're just
doing the same thing over and over again
and I realize oh and I realize that that
they're just not gonna put out anything
that I'm interested in
then I'll unsubscribe I have a really
hard time unsubscribing from channels
with smaller smaller followings I always
feel really bad so sometimes I'll just
stay subscribed even though I don't
really watch the videos as much because
I just feel bad but larger people that I
don't eat that I know have no idea that
I'm subscribed to them I'll just
unsubscribe anybody that's like 100,000
or more Monica says Cassie from terrific
I love her we haven't talked about hurry
yeah I do love Cassie I adore Cassie
from thrift tech she is another channel
that I feel like is very thorough very
honest and I definitely enjoy her
channel Claire says I really love the
trend of following another youtubers
makeup tutorial I think at laughing to
discovery of other great channels I'm
would you consider doing when these
videos I actually did I did well sort of
I did rich looks because I wanted to do
something fun and that has been one of
my favorite videos I've ever filmed was
my doing rich Lux's YouTube his look I
had so much fun and you get to see my
family
I brought around and showed my family my
face but Lauren may beauty yes
absolutely if you have a
all channel and you have no idea what
you want to film and you don't have a
lot of money to make a bunch of you know
review videos Lauren may beauty comes up
with the most creative videos that cost
absolutely no money to make and they're
good they're really good sabi says I
loved here for the tea she pointed out
the biggest issue with these false
people who make opportunities Harder's
for others yes she put out a really good
video is very interesting I thought I
was it yesterday they she had to watch
it in like five pieces because I had my
kids yesterday and I was editing but it
was a video about an instagramer that I
had never heard of before but she broke
down why she believes this Instagrammer
has been buying followers and kind of
shows the evidence behind it and I
thought that was very interesting I get
emails all the time about buying
followers all the time and I actually
thought about doing a video with like
one of my other channels that I don't
use like I have an ASMR channel that I
it's cringy just so you know it's a
little bit like I can't even watch it
because it's a little I don't know it's
a little creepy but anyway so like doing
it on that channel that I don't upload
to anymore and like buying followers on
it just to see how many followers I get
and like how it works but Sam did that
work for me on that one I won't do that
now because it's just I get so many
emails and I'm so curious about what it
actually does when you buy followers
like how it actually works but she
already um she already did the work for
me so I don't have to wonder anymore
Shana says I know the bigger ones just
can't interact and I just don't like
that I wash meet Orioles cuz I'm
learning and I have questions so how can
you learn without being able to ask
questions you know yeah and I feel like
like I have to buddy which is a plug-in
and one thing I really like about to
Buddy is it allows me to filter my
comments by questions so anybody that
uses a question mark it'll actually
filter it so that I see it to make sure
that I get to answer the questions I
don't always use it all the time but I
need to use it more it is really hard
for larger influencers to answer
questions but but it is possible to at
least answer a few you know I feel like
every influencer should spend at least
15-20 minutes after an upload just
responding to people I actually
adopt harding as many comments because i
was getting people that were getting
upset that this was back when I was
reading the the like the gossip forums
and stuff I don't read them anymore but
someone had actually I I can't lie to
you I did peek I did peek the other day
but I try really hard not to look at
them okay I try really hard but I can't
lie to you I peeked I looked at reddit a
couple days ago and I feel guilty about
it
forgive me YouTube for I have broken my
own role but anyway point was is that
what was my point that oh they were
upset because they said that I had
harder to comment before theirs and
after theirs or they were in live chat
and I hadn't I hadn't acknowledged them
even though I acknowledged a comment
before and after them and they thought
that I was purposely not acknowledging
them which is so not true so so I
stopped Harding as many comments like
the love feature because I don't want
anybody's feelings get hurt if I don't
hit that love on them so what I'm doing
is I'm loving the comments that add to
the video instead like things that add
information like maybe I you know they
said they added on information that I
didn't know or they clarified something
something like that so I'm Harding those
instead because I don't want to hurt
anybody's feelings by not giving a heart
I know isn't that weird but I don't I
don't like hurting people's feelings it
upsets me that someone's upset because I
didn't you know do something like that
but I do think that youtubers on the
whole need to interact more with their
audience absolutely 100% especially
larger channels and I think they don't
do it because they don't need to they're
gonna get views no matter what and if
you look at some of these social blades
if you don't know social blade social
blade calm you can look up any
influencer and see you know how much
money approximately they make and what
their view count is and all that I mean
some of these people are making you know
fifty seventy five thousand dollars a
month just in Google Adsense according
to their social blades so a month can
you imagine getting fifty thousand
dollars a month seventy-five thousand
dollars a month that's a lot of money
they don't and they're not interacting
with their audience so why do they why
should they it's not going to audience
obviously doesn't
CAIR you know at least on the viewing
standpoint they're still gonna get views
no matter what Firefly says in case you
missed it you see Steph nicole was
working on a skincare brand I actually
knew that I knew that from when I went
to visit her but I didn't know she had
announced it so hopefully I didn't blow
up or spotting well I mean you guys
wouldn't have known about it if she
didn't announce it but yeah she had
mentioned that to me when I went to go
visit her but I didn't say anything
because it's not my secret to tell but
she that's exciting that she announced
it though it's really exciting I'm very
happy for her very very happy for her
because you know it's gonna be legit if
Steph is doing it cuz she's it's gonna
be legit I'm really excited about it
Michelle says you will never be able to
please everyone just be yourself oh
absolutely I know but I just want to
make sure that you know I'm not doing
things that make people upset
consciously you know Yvonne says is the
number of followers not secondary I
thought viewcount get paid yes view
counts do get paid doc that's what gets
paid is if you count not the number of
followers that's true did I say that it
was the number of followers if I did
that I misspoke I didn't mean that
men manifested muses dropping a bunch of
hearts thank you
angelic Angela says now I would buy a
Stephanie Nicole product she knows her
stuff
yes she does but counting that stuff I
have not spoken to her about this I do
not know the price point but it's
probably gonna be expensive if what
Stephanie Stephanie likes her expensive
skincare I'm sure she will do her best
to get the price down but the stuff she
loves is very expensive
hi latina Kathleen as a matter oh she
says Kathleen as a medical professional
not all indeed bite what onion vitamins
have a chance to be excreted by the body
a person can overdose on water it
depends on your body and what state
you're in yes and and that's one thing
we're gonna talk about when I do the
vitamin video is water soluble vitamins
versus fat soluble vitamins which ones
are in the formula which ones are from
water solvent which ones are fat soluble
like for example vitamin C is water
water soluble so if you get an access of
see in your system you like you get that
you see those vitamin C pills if you
have an excess of vitamin C in your
system it just gets flushed out like
it's just your body takes what it needs
and the rest just goes out as long as
you are a typically healthy person you
know if you don't have any medical
conditions
let's see Martha says do view counts
count if you don't watch the whole thing
yes they do or if you go back to the
video and see a reply to your comment
I've always wondered yes that counts as
an additional view every time you click
on the video it does count as a view
now what helps it have what helps in the
YouTube algorithm as far as view count
is if you do watch more than their watch
time goes up which makes them look like
they have a better channel which YouTube
really likes so it'll be more suggested
if they have a longer watch amount of
time it's not the percentage of it's not
the percentage of the watch time of the
video like for example to make up minute
if you watch the whole minute that
doesn't look any better than if you
watched a minute of a live chat it's the
total number of minutes watched on the
channel not the percentage of the video
watched if that makes sense
Julie says Jen you do a great job making
us to a part of Channel I'm so glad I
hope so because I do feel like this is
about us it's not just about me it's
about us and I feel like a lot of
YouTube channels it's all about that
person here it has nothing to do with
the audience it's not it but I feel like
that's the only way I can have a channel
is because I don't feel like you know
I'm not a trained makeup artist I'm not
an esthetician I just had a makeup
enthusiast who really cares about doing
things in a thorough way that's just who
I am
I love researching I love all of that so
I bring a lot to the table but I don't
bring the complete picture and that's
where the audience that's where the
collective brain comes in is that we all
work together to put the whole picture
together I've got a puzzle piece she's
got a puzzle piece he's got a puzzle
piece they've got a puzzle piece over
there and it's all you know we all work
together to get that complete picture
and I think that's really important to
what I want my channel to be I don't
expect every channel to be like mine
this is just a personal preference but
you know I think that's important too
my total what I'm trying to do here
Jordi wants to I have always wonder if
we make a difference if you watch the
whole ad versus clicking clicking a skip
ad it does make a difference youtuber
makes more money if you watch the whole
ad and if you click on the ID youtuber
it makes more money but they still make
money with you skip it's just not as
much Allison says it's such a great
point you do a great job of building a
community feel thank you I don't just
feel like someone's sitting in the
audience I hope you I can do that with
my channel awesome her name is Alison
Jacobs áall is o N Jacobs J AC OBS in
case you want to check out her channel
so yeah let's see what else what else
drives us crazy or what do we want to
talk about as far as YouTube channels
cuz we've got my son's asking me for
approval for downloading an app not
right now sir not right now Jenny says
what size is that freaking flawless
shirt this is Taylor's merchandise from
that Tayla I wear this in live chat all
the time because I think it's just so
cute it I think it's a small yeah it's a
small and it does kind of go off the
shoulder if I want it to I really like
this shirt it's very comfortable Firefly
says I feel like Jen would be great in a
beauty news segment in the news show you
have like a broadcaster voice oh thank
you I feel like this channel is more
about Beauty consumerism the make of
itself this channel here is more about
Beauty consumerism well I mean kind of
in a way I mean it's a review channel so
I think my my job I feel like as a
review channel is to purchase things or
get things and analyze it so you can
decide and make an educated decision
about what you want to purchase so in a
way I think you know makeup it's I mean
I think that's part of makeup itself you
know I get what you're saying but yeah I
mean I guess it is about consumerism in
that you know I'm trying to educate you
so that you can make a decision on
whether a product is right for you or
not
I don't think that I push consumerism on
my channel I mean I guess you can say
like whatsapp and make up the product
report is kind of pushing consumerism in
a way
but it's just giving information I'm not
like saying buy this buy this buy this
buy this like I feel like a lot of
channels well you know they'll get
things in PR and they'll try it for 30
seconds and then they'll say buy this
buy this buy this buy this I feel like
that's pushing consumerism where I'm
just trying to give you information so
you can decide whether you want to
purchase it or not at least that's my
perspective I don't feel feel like I
push consumerism more than you know
maybe it encourages it in some people
and for that I apologize
but I'm just trying to give you
information I don't know about makeup
itself I mean I guess a video channel
about makeup itself would be more of
like a tutorial channel which I'm not
because I can't be I can't be a tutorial
channel because I don't I don't do
makeup that well I do okay but I don't
do well enough to do a tutorial channel
not there I'll keep trying but I'm not
there Lully says what about the
youtubers who are always neutral like do
you like it or not just tell me you
don't have to bash them to give me an
opinion yeah definitely I mean I think I
definitely do that on my channel
sometimes do though where I'm like okay
this is what it is this is what it is
and you have to decide for yourself but
I also always try to give my personal
opinion I don't always but I try to give
my personal opinion on it as well but I
think I mean just to like I think that's
kind of like a haul is what I like I
don't like hauls I don't watch hauls
because it's like oh I got this and I
don't even know what it is but here it
is and that's what it looks like and you
know that's it I mean there are a lot of
people that do like hauls and I think
that's why the product report and what's
up in makeup people seem to really like
that it's cuz it's kind of like haul but
without the whole stuff going it's a lot
of stuff so you can kind of keep up on
what's coming out but I try to give in
in an opinion I do
I do try but staying neutral I don't
know is how do you even stay neutral in
a review that's not the point
yeah it's not the point of the review
all right it has been it has been one
hour let's just answer a couple more
questions what about the ones who review
a drugstore a product and say it's
really good for drugstore what does that
mean is it good or not I'm guilty of
saying that
I think that it means that it's not as
good as some of the higher-end products
that they own but if you're in a pinch
and you don't want to spend the money on
the higher end stuff it works but not
great that's the way I interpret that
Dian cecht era but our baby says the
best halls I know I want you to do more
reviews though because the reviews are
so good but she does do a lot of halls a
woman house house has to have a lot of
makeup I love her
Yvonne says every video which is
reasonably good gets a thumbs up for me
because I want to reward people for
taking the time to do a video I can tell
you I have thumbs down less than five
videos in my entire life probably at
least less than ten and it was because
they were downright offensive
I don't bums down video some people
thumbs down videos like candy they're
like you get a thumbs down and you get a
thumbs down you get a thumbs down I
don't do that I mean it's still
engagement it doesn't really matter but
but anyway I got to go I got to pop off
here because it's my family day but
thank you so much for being here I'm
hoping I can get my my nicer camera to
work I'm really upset that it was
lagging so bad it might just be a
YouTube thing but we'll try it again at
some point maybe we'll do like a smaller
livestream or maybe I can just kind of
test it in the meantime I think that I
can test it on private and kind of play
with it this week before shott next
weekend hopefully I can get it working
because the camera quality is so much
better on that camera than this one but
thank you again for being here and if
you have any additional things you want
to add to the conversation definitely
leave those in the comments below I just
realized that I should have used my dry
shampoo this morning by the way thank
you to everybody on my favorites video
for telling me that they're with me on
not washing their hair but once or twice
a week cuz I thought I was the only one
until everybody is like yeah I do it too
is the same thing with like the crystals

but apparently I'm not apparently
there's a lot of people that are into
crystals too so you know it's kind of
