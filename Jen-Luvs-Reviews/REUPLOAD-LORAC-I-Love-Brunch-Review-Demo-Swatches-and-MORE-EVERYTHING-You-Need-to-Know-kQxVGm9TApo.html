the lorac I love brunch palette so sit
back relax grab your mimosa and let's
get to talking about some makeup if
you've never been to one of my reviews
before they are quite long and involved
so if you would like to skip ahead to a
specific portion of the video there will
be timestamps little clickable links
down below for you to find exactly what
you're looking for we're gonna start
with the fact that this is right now to
my knowledge only available at Ulta I
believe it is available in Ultra stores
as well as Ulta calm this is made in the
united states but some of the
ingredients are made outside of the
united states so as far as this being
cruelty free lorac does have a statement
on their website saying that they are
cruelty free but then they also make the
statement that they do not apply for
cruelty free status with like leaping
bunny and places like that because they
cannot guarantee that the suppliers of
their suppliers are not cruelty free so
they feel a moral obligation not to
apply for those programs so depending on
your level of cruelty furriness you may
say lorac is cruelty free you may say
that you don't know if lorac is cruelty
free and decide not to purchase from
them I will link an article down below
by cruelty free kitty about her opinion
on this issue this is however not a
vegan product because some of the
shadows may or may not include an
ingredient called carmine which is made
from beetles so this would not be for
the vegans out there by the way the
eyeshadow primer that does come with
this is also not vegan it does have
beeswax in it along with the eyeshadow
palette you do get a dual sided brush
one is a little bit shorter a little
more dense and one is quite fluffy I
would imagine this would be for packing
color on the lid even though I do feel
like it's a bit round for packing on the
lid and I don't I wish that the taper
went down a little bit more but I do
like this as a fluffy blending brush
it's a little bit long but it's dense
enough and it's a it's stiff enough that
you can really work the shadow and
actually enjoy using it this lorac
behind the scenes eye primer deluxe
sample eye this isn't my favorite primer
I don't find that it works
better than my urban decay better than
my Ulta brand I do happen to like those
better than this I don't feel like this
is quite as effective it's not a bad
primer it's just not my favorite within
this palette you do get 16 eyeshadows
eight of them are shimmer and eight of
them are matte but unlike some lorac
palettes they aren't mixed through some
lorac palettes or you know they've got
all the shimmer all together and then
all the mattes all together they have
chosen not to do that they're kind of
mixed through there's no shadows in here
that I feel like they call a shimmer but
aren't really shimmer except for this
one here that's called eggs Benny this
one has some glitter in it some actual
silver glitter in it this one has some
very very maybe some fine glitter in it
but not me it's really fine if we're
gonna call that glitter that one's
called pancakes it's more of a satiny
shimmery shade same thing with Bloody
Mary just very very fine fine sparkle in
there but eggs benny has some
significant sparkle in it the rest are
more of like a satiny kind of finish
they're definitely not foiled in any way
they just have kind of a shine a sheen
to them this palette is $44 it contains
thirteen point six grams of product
making it three dollars and twenty four
cents per gram of product that's if you
don't count the brush and the primer as
part of the value if you're just saying
that those are bonus those don't count
this eyeshadow palette isn't the best
value it's not a terrible value it's
kind of like in the middle to a little
more expensive when you carry compared
to brands like two-faced Urban Decay
palettes like that that I see as being
kind of similar price point brands it's
really not the best value but again it's
not terrible now I did buy one of the
blushes as well that's kind of a little
bonus review we're throwing in Florio
there are two blushes in this line this
one is called luma this was the one that
stood out to me is one that I wanted to
try this blush is $23 it contains 5.1
grams of product equaling out to $4 and
51 cents per gram again kind of
middle-of-the-road - a little bit
expensive but better some other blushes
that are in kind of the same price range
we have the Amazonian 12-hour clay
blushes those are four dollars and
ninety four cents per gram the NARS
blushes are six dollars and 61 cents per
gram
the two-faced Papa don't peach is $3.31
their eyeshadow palettes are less per
gram as well and the it cosmetics
radiance ombre blush is two dollars and
23 cents per gram so that is the least
expensive so this one's kind of in the
middle too a little expensive just like
the palette so now my very favorite part
of the review these swatches I'm gonna
go ahead and show those to you now so
let's go ahead and look at those now
right here is the I love brunch palette
we're gonna start with the first row
lavender eggs Benny gluten-free and hot
sauce so lavender was probably the
lamest choice to put first because it's
definitely by far the weakest shade in
the palette
it doesn't swatch well it doesn't work
well it's not good eggs Benny is just
okay gluten-free is my favorite in this
row and hot sauce is actually also a
really good shade it doesn't swatch
great but it's a good shade so you can
see in the brush wash how weak lavender
is it's pretty terrible eggs Benny could
it be good but there just isn't enough
pigment in there there's a little bit of
sparkle but it kind of falls away when
you actually use it now here's just
evidence of the awesomeness of gluten
free and then hot sauce is a good shade
it's not a great shade but it's a good
shade it does what it's supposed to do
in a very light easy way and then this
is the entire first row it's my least
favorite row overall but gluten free is
definitely the star here now moving on
to the white test the reason for the
white test is to show you what happens
when you kind of over blend the shadows
what may happen if you try to wear them
all day which shadows are going to last
the longest and as you can see hot sauce
is the only one that really truly sticks
around so just be careful when you're
blending these shadows on this road
because if you ever blend they are going
to disappear next moving on to the
second row jelly doughnut pancakes
sorbet and valet again another row that
isn't fantastic but it's definitely
better than the first row jelly doughnut
is very nice as a brow bone shade it's
got a lot of
paucity to it for packing on the lid it
is a nice color you can see what the
brush swatch that jelly doughnut really
is a nice shade you'd be able to see it
even better on a deeper skin tone
pancakes on the other hand is a little
bit weak it's okay it's just a little
powdery and I don't know it's not my
favorite sorbet I actually really really
like even though it's not swatching the
best here it's a very nice transition
shade on me believe it or not and I do
enjoy it ballet is another really weak
powdery shade it just doesn't show up
anywhere and it fades really fast so
this is row two all together and as you
can see there really isn't a lot of
color happening here sorbet is the only
one you can even really see that much on
my skin tone but I would say the winners
from this row are jelly doughnut and
sorbet and I'm wiping very lightly here
and you can see that sorbet is the only
one that really sticks around you have a
little bit of Val a surprisingly but I
had a really hard time working with Val
a on the lid now this third row is my
favorite row in the palette they're all
good if not great shadows first we have
Bloody Mary
then blueberry scone then moonlight and
then avocado toast which is my absolute
favorite shade in this palette it is
really fun to play with Bloody Mary kind
of blends out it's not a great shade
it's not bad but it just it's kind of
hard to work within that that sparkle
that's there doesn't really stay around
blueberry scone is a very nice shade
it's very mild soft blue so if you want
a little bit of blue without it being
too loud blueberry scones a nice shade
moonlight is a nice brightening shade
but I wish it was just a little bit
brighter I wish it had the intensity of
gluten-free but in that yellow kind of
buttery Buttercup kind of color and of
course avocado toast oh it's just so
pretty
it'll give you a nice pop of color
without being so incredibly overpowering
so again this row is my absolute
favorite
we really like it a lot and for the
white test you can see that these all
hang around pretty well except for
moonlight that fades away one thing I
appreciate about these shadows is they
do stay true to their color when they
start fading away
they don't change to brown or gray as
you wipe them which is great moving into
that bottom row we have mimosa smoothie
french toast and sundae Funday mimosa is
my absolute favorite shade in this row I
really like it it's very opaque very
bright smoothie they nailed it on the
shimmery purple I wish that they have
been able to do that with the matte
purple but the shimmery purple at least
it definitely holds true to that color
really nice and pigmented french toast
ends up not performing well on the lid
it ends up being almost like a wash of
color rather than an opaque color so it
definitely is one of my least favorite
shades in the palette and then Sunday
Funday swatch is really bad but it
actually can perform very nicely on the
eye especially if you pair it with hot
sauce or Bloody Mary it'll kind of beef
up those shades on its own it does look
pretty weak so overall with this row the
only big win is mimosa followed very
closely by smoothie french toast and
sundae Funday just kind of
now with the wife test you'll see that
these hang out pretty well considering
that they're not super deep shades I'm
actually quite impressed but mosa hangs
out the best and all the rest just kind
of fade a little bit but not completely
now you have seen the swatches of the
palette let's go ahead and go into the
demo of how I got this look today a deal
with the death
I won't leave a trace
I'm gonna sleep with one eye open the
trust we made and broke jokes and I got
a witness
you'll never suspect
you
you better sleep with one eye open
analysis is when I go to ewg or
environmental working group org and
other websites that I trust to tell you
about ingredients that are in these
products and whether you need to be
careful of anything with the ingredients
so we're gonna start with the eye shadow
palette and then we're going to talk
about the blush the first thing I want
to let you know is that 15 out of the 16
shades do have the same ingredients in
the same order the one that is different
is the shade moonlight that one it does
not have carmine listed as a possible
ingredient and then there's this
ingredient but I cannot pronounce I'm
not even gonna dry that is also in the
moonlight but is not in the other 15
shades now one has no ingredient
concerns it's just different
it's a silicon-based binding agent so
maybe they just had more trouble with
that one kind of sticking together and
being a solid pressed shadow maybe
that's why they used that that's my
speculation so big shocker first
ingredient and then this palette is talc
talc can be irritating to some people
there's also some data gaps for talc
people things that we just don't know
about talc the next one is at the XO
palmitate which is another one that's
not a big chakra it's pretty much in
every single eyeshadow palette it's a
derivative of palm oil and basically
it's an allergen to some people next one
is something called propylene glycol
it's a skin conditioning agent there's
conflicting statements about some
irritation concerns but polished choice
says there's no concern when it comes to
cosmetics potassium sorbate is a
preservative also irritation concerns
and then with the pigments the yellow
colorant is the same one we see in a lot
of eyeshadow palettes it is lip safe
according to the FDA but there's mixed
data as to whether or not this agreed
yet is bio cumulative meaning it can
build up in your system by scientists in
Canada the amount used in a product is
regulated in the European Union and then
the last one is another colorant which
is called ultramarines and the
ultramarines are not lips safe so make
sure you're not putting these shadows on
your lips I don't know
which ones absolutely contain
ultramarines there's no real way to know
according to the ingredient list it
looks like they could all possibly and
contain ultramarine so just be safe and
don't put them on your lips
now with the blush a lot of the
ingredients that we're in the eye shadow
are also in the blush so you can
cross-reference that I'll also put that
down
the description below but there is an
ingredient in this that is not in the
eyeshadow palette and that is the
retinol palmitate and is listed as a
nine on Environmental Working Group
which is a really really high score very
rarely do I see anything above a five in
an ingredient it is a skin condition
agent and it's a form of vitamin A so
the big concern about this ingredient is
that it sometimes contained in
sunscreens and there is some evidence to
support that it actually causes skin
sensitivity to sunlight so I'm not sure
how big of a deal it would be in a blush
I'm just gonna read what the website
I'll link it down below says it says may
speed the development of skin tumors and
lesions when applied to the skin and the
presence of sunlight it is a known human
or reproductive toxins it's banned or
found unsafe in cosmetics in Germany one
or more animal studies showed tumor
formation in low doses because it does
absorb into the skin now polish choice
says that this is absolutely not true
that what they did was they tested this
particular ingredient on rats and they
tested it in full concentration and the
rats had tumors so the amount of that
ingredient that is in a powder blush is
probably insignificant compared to what
it was on the rats that made it seem
like this was something that was really
really bad and shouldn't be in any
cosmetics so they say they're based on a
study for nearly from nearly 20 years
ago that has never been reproduced or
tested under real-life conditions such
as how people use sunscreens that
contain this ingredient also a polished
choice website it says that the Skin
Cancer Foundation's a Fido
photo biology committee stated that
there's no scientific evidence that
retinol palmitate causes cancer in
humans so but I do want to put it out
there just in case that freaks you out
this is definitely not something you
want to purchase so now on to my full
review so let's start with the eyeshadow
palette there's some bright spots
there's some here that aren't a bit
aren't but I think what it comes down to
is that about half this palette is not
good at all
like this shade right here lavender I
don't know what they were thinking
making this the very first shade because
it's the worst shade in the palette you
can see in the swatches it doesn't show
up
at all but then you have some gems like
avocado toast which is my absolute
favorite in here I also really love
mimosa I really love sorbet I really
love gluten-free there are some
fantastic shades in here
I bought this knowing it was going to be
a supplemental palate meaning that I was
going to have to pull from other palates
in order to make this work because there
really are no mid-tone or deep shades I
wish that they had gotten rid of either
hot sauce Bloody Mary or sundae Funday
and done a deep dark chocolate color to
at least give us something to deepen the
look to give some kind of dimension
there's just nothing there a shade that
I absolutely love though I have to tell
you about is guilt free guilt free is
one where if you do a matte look with
this and you want to just shimmer it up
you can layer guilt-free overtop and it
will give them all this beautiful
shimmer and shine I really really love
that shade I wish eggs benny i wish that
the glitter that shows up in eggs benny
and the swatches actually stayed on the
eyes unfortunately a lot of these
shadows will fade away if you over blend
them if you're trying to work with
multiple shadows you have to keep going
back and forth back and forth and back
and forth between the shadows to get
them to show up and and be true to color
but that being said i can see some
people really enjoying this palette
especially people that like nice a calm
color unfortunately there's so many
shades in here that are duds that i
really can't recommend it to you as a
palette i just can't
it's not good some people have been
asking me to compare this to the pastel
goth i do have a live swatch session
that I did impromptu when i unbox this
that i will link down below but i'll
show you just very quickly the pastel
goth by Kat Von D was another pastel
palette that came out recently and you
can see right away the difference in the
brightness of the shadows I mean there's
just no comparison and these will give
you this kind of color payoff these they
look pastel these are not true pastels
in my opinion they're more just very
bright neon lighter tone two shades
if you don't like this because it's too
bright you might like some of the shades
in here but it does break my heart yet
it's so many of them are just not good
shadows I do feel like that they are
improving on their their pastel green
they did have some the mint Edition
palette they came out a while back and
this avocado toast is so much better
than the mint shade that was in that
palette so I'm really happy that they
improved it I think that that because of
avocado toast and because of mimosa and
a couple of other shades in here I'm
probably going to keep this palette but
kind of reluctantly because I don't
think it's worth $44 at all I do want to
show this to you this is the lorac
California Dreaming palette this is
actually not my palette this belongs to
my friend Meredith she's a tattoo artist
at our tattoo studio she loves makeup
just as much as I do which is a
fantastic to have conversations with her
she's also a wonderful artist I will
link her Instagram down below in case
you want to check her tattoos out but
this palette I from swatching it I I did
swatch it but I have not put it on my
eyes because it doesn't belong to me but
I really find the shade selection in
here to be a lot more interesting as far
as the amount of looks you can get the
pigmentation of it it just seems like a
better overall palette as far as the
shade range again I haven't used it
personally Meredith seems to really like
it reviews seem to be really gone on it
so just from my limited experience with
this if you're gonna pick one of the two
to try lorac eyeshadows I would
recommend the California Dreaming over
this the price program is a little
cheaper with this but you're also not
getting the brush in the primer so that
may make a difference to you so final
thoughts on the palette I feel like it's
good intended I feel like they missed
the mark and lastly just a quick review
on the blush I would be very hesitant to
put this on someone of a medium to
deeper skin tone because it is extremely
pastel and I did put this on my friend
that is a Filipino descent she has a
medium all of these skin tone and I put
it on her hand like it was like give me
your hand Jenny and I grabbed your hand
and kind of put it on her hand and she
was like wow she's amazing though she
laughs you thought was funny cuz I could
use her hand anytime but anyway so when
I blended it out on her it kind of
blended into her skin tone and it really
wasn't flattering on her it looked very
powdery where with me I feel like it
goes on my cheeks you can see it but
it's a very subtle color so if you like
a really subtle blush with a little bit
of a glow you'll probably really love
this lasting power is pretty good on it
it lasts me good good through a good six
to eight hours which is wonderful for a
blush oh I forgot to mention lasting car
with this it's okay it just really
depends on what shadows you use whether
you use the good ones or the bad ones if
you use the good ones it's gonna last a
lot longer than if you use the bad ones
it's not gonna lose a lot you know last
very long if you look at the swatches
the ones that tend to wipe away those
don't last as long as the ones that have
more pigmentation that seem to last more
on my arm it's very true to the wipe
test so we use that as reference but it
does give a little bit of a glow so if
you have textured skin you may like it
you may not it may accentuate your pores
I didn't find it accentuated my pores on
my face but I don't have large pores so
I can't really speak to that so if you
like a lot of pop a lot of pigment in
your blush you won't like this if you
want something more natural that you
really can't mess up you might actually
really like this blush even though it's
getting terrible reviews online that's
