the new Coastal Scents revealed palette
I'm going to tell you right away that
this was sent to me for promotional
purposes but it will not influence my
review at all I tote told Coastal Scents
when they send me the email they said
they want to send me some me I said as
long as you're okay with me having given
you an honest review I will definitely
review it in there well like yeah that's
fine so that's how I ended up with this
one unfortunately you will not get in
this video as a comparison with naked 3
which is something that a lot of people
are looking for with this so if that was
what you're looking for I'm sorry I
don't have that but I can speak to the
quality of these shadows whether I feel
it's worth purchasing I am gonna show
you some up-close swatches I am also
going to show you a look it is a look
that I'm wearing today and how I created
this look using this palette it is a
very natural daytime wear kind of look
so I'm going to show you that in just a
minute I do want to show you the
swatches first you know what they look
like before I go into the that you torn
up tutorial but the little demo version
of how I use this palette so let's just
talk about the shadows first and the oh
and then the end of the video I'm gonna
give you just an overall of my opinion
of the palette so far now this palette I
when I first went on their website it
looked like it was 999 and now I'm
looking at it and it looks like it's
1999 so I either I misread it at first
or they've upped the price doubling it
so it is a very popular palette right
now there's a lot of buzz about it so
maybe that's why it is now $19.99 or
maybe it was just on sale when it first
came out I'm not quite sure but what you
really need to know is right now it is
$19.99 so what I'm going to do right now
is I'm going to show you the up-close
swatches you can see how they go on and
how they look
Oh
so overall as you can see the color
payoff on these is really really good I
mean just really nice color payoff
there was only one shade that I felt
like did not have a good color payoff
and that was this one down here my only
other complaint about the shades is that
the ones down here are very very similar
I'm not sure if you notice that in the
big arm a swatch but a lot of them there
isn't a whole lot of variation up here I
felt like there were two they were very
similar and that's these two so I don't
know I mean I was a little disappointed
in that but overall I felt like the
quality these somebody put a lot of love
into this palette and trying to make it
really awesome if you're not familiar
with the original revealed palette that
one have a lot of dupes for the Urban
Decay Naked 1 and Naked not naked one
but it was called the Naked palette and
then the Naked 2 palette and and people
really like that because they're those
palettes are very very very popular and
very famous for being amazing this one
is I believe I don't know if Coastal
Scents meant to on purpose but this one
supposedly has a lot of dupes for the
Naked 3 in the revealed 2 palette I feel
like overall with the quality of these
shadows I really really liked them now I
do want to show you the look that I put
on today and how they actually apply to
the eye so I'm gonna go ahead and show
you that right now
walking with the perma-grin heads so hi
I'm back with you and all this right
shaking on the apple tree picking off
the honeybees watch them fly it's just
like we never said goodbye and you're
like the wall
burnout shirt that soiled with dirt but
fits me like a glove I will not let you
let me die I will not let you let me
down this time this is my final climb
again father and son either
my
head is dizzy from the spinner breaking
up and breaking down making up making
out Brown
I've learned to get up
I can feel it we are
let me down
but you let me
this time this is my
why
propel me
right back in
I'm all this
Oh chiz
you just scratch
this time
so that I look I was really really happy
with the application of the shadows I
did apply it one other day to other days
this past week one day I was really
happy with the other day I was not happy
with I did not like the way that the
colors blended on my I thought they were
like they were very difficult to blend
one down here that I felt was difficult
to blend was this one I did not enjoy
that also I use this kind of yellowy
champagne color it was super super
glittery I had to use some of the matte
shades that kind of calm it down just
because it was just too much it there
was too much going on I was going to
work and I was like oh my god knows I
just put all this glitter all over my
eye like glitter but like an intense
amount of shimmer if you enjoy an
intense amount of shimmer you will like
this there's a couple of other shades
that have an intense amount of shimmer
but you can see those in the schwanz
watches in the swatches that show it a
little while ago um but overall do I
feel like this is worth twenty dollars
depending on whether you already had on
these colors or not if you do already
have these colors then no it's not worth
twenty dollars if you feel like this has
enough variation if you enjoy these
pinky tones here then yes I do feel like
this is worth twenty dollars
the colors are overall very very creamy
very easy to apply very easy to blend
overall like I said there were a couple
bumps in the road with a few of the
shades but overall very happy with them
I like how they included some matte
selections along with their shimmer
selections I feel like this would be a
really nice on any skin tone they've got
some colors that would really show up
beautifully on some deeper skin tones I
mean can you imagine this red shade on a
deep skin tone oh he's so beautiful so
not just on lighter skin tones like mine
but also on the deeper and the only
other criticism I have of this is I feel
like a lot of these shades are very
randomly placed it would be really nice
if they set them off kind of the way I
have been this is the naked naked to
power the way they set these up as they
put kind of you're blending your your
lid shades over here and then they've
moved to the darker crease shades over
here and then your um you know accent
you know really darkening your outer V
kind of shades over here I wish that
this palette was set up in a similar
fashion so that it was a little more
user friendly for people that aren't
used to putting on shadow and aren't
quite sure where to put the colors
that I would give as a critique for
people who it's just not very user
friendly in the setup of it also I would
have loved to have seen a mirror here I
think that would have been nice to have
and I guess that would have raised the
price of it so maybe that's why they did
not include that but that would have
been nice for travel purposes to have a
mirror there especially if this is a
major pallet that you're going to be
using often so overall I think the
reveal 2 is a win and if you know but
again it's going to be one of those
personal preference things of whether
you feel like this is something that
would be worth it to you
so one thing I wanted to tell you about
the reveal palette that I'm really
excited about is Coastal Scents decided
they were going to give me a gift card
they said they would give me $100 worth
of gift over the products off of the
Coastal Scents websites now I have a
stupid amount of makeup like a really
stupid amount of makeup so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna split that up into
two pieces that I'm going to give it to
