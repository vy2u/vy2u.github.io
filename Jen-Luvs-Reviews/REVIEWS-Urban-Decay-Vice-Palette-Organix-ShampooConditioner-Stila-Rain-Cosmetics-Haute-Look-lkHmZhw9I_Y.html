hello everyone I completely failed on
making September favorites videos so
count this as my sep tember favorites
video first thing i got for i actually
bought this in the ends of august i
bought these were products from stila um
i had had a damaged I don't come from
hautelook so when steal it came on I
used my credit end up paying like a
dollar and change for these things
because of the credit that I got plus
the discounts from hautelook so I'll
tell you about the good one first the
one that I liked out of the two but it's
a prime pot and this is in the color
caramel so here's that swatch see how
it's a little bit dark for me so I can
really only use this when i'm doing a
little bit darker of a look from doing
something really light I can't use this
but it has worked very well for me it
does not crease on my lid I do enjoy the
color it's just something I have to be
conscious of when I choose my colors
that something really light is might not
transfer the way I want it to using this
color as the base as the primers I would
recommend this if you're in the market
for a primer especially if you see this
on hautelook for discounted price
alright the second thing I got I was not
absolutely not happy with which was the
Cielo convertible eye color I mean any
idea this is pretty genius unen thought
this whoever thought this did a great
job but it did not work for me you get a
pencil so let me show you that and you
can see it's kind of smushed on the top
and the reason why it's mush is if
you're in a rush and you forget to roll
it down then put the cap on and it just
smushes so maybe it's just not
idiot-proof the other thing about it is
that it does kind of shake in there so
I'm worried when it gets low it will
start falling out of the of the casing
of it or web you call it liked the
little pin thing it is really creamy to
put on and it's not a bad liner I have
had some trouble with the staying power
of it and I don't like that
stay on very well but but let me show
you what's what's really smart about
this what they did was along with the
liner they have a matching shadow in
here and this is how that works I guess
the shadow is in here I was free which
way to put it but the shadow is in here
and then you get this little domed foamy
brush to put it on with this eyeshadow
had no staying power it was like gone
very quickly whoo and that's the other
problem is did you see that watch watch
Wow but if you don't push it in all the
way and you don't screw it in it does
fly out and then also built in which is
smart is this like a smudge little
brushy thing you show you how that
smudge is it but look watch this has
been sitting on my hand for a while and
like it really smudges it like that
eyeliner you can see how it goes away
and then watch when I smudge the
eyeshadow bye bye see you later
eyeshadow excellent idea not very well
executed and I forgot to tell you this
is the color ID so I've been looking for
a dark green liner and this is not going
to be it for me this is going to go into
my random cosmetics that I don't use bag
okay so this was your things I got from
stila now on to rain cosmetics now rain
cosmetics is a company I had never heard
of before I saw it on hautelook and when
I before i bought the stuff I did a
couple of watch a couple of videos on
youtube to see what people thought I
went on makeup ally to see what people
thought there and overall was pretty
positive reviews and I have to agree
with that I'll show you my favorite
thing that I got first which was this I
show duo and the colors in this our
Buddha and agave and it's a silky duel
eyeshadow is what it's called by rain
cosmetics
this cute packaging super cute and then
when you open it up you can see the
little pressed print of those some of
the logo for ring there it didn't come
with any kind of brush which I'm fine
with I'm okay with that when the colors
are gorgeous it's like a dark a dark
green like a look again it's similar to
what i was looking for with this and
didn't get it and then the the color
here is like a the muted Beijing yellow
but it goes on very very bright it's a
really nice lid blendable color and I
put these quality of these shadows
straight up with my Urban Decay colors
that i love i really really love these
shadows and right now I've decided I'm
not buying any more eyeshadows for a
really long time we'll see how long last
but I don't plan on buying the
eyeshadows for long talks I've way too
many but when I'm in the market for more
eyeshadows whenever that may be because
I never hit pan on my shadows I don't
know if I'll ever buy another eye shadow
again if I follow that um I would love
to check out more of these i highly
recommend the rain eyeshadows also from
rain i am wearing the lipstick and
lipgloss that i bought now this lipstick
is called stretch limo the color is very
deceiving what if you could see it on my
lips but look how pink that is it's like
super pink i still really love it it's
very smooth it has a typical lipstick
kind of smell does not smell great but
it's not offensive this is a lip gloss
um this is one of their lip glosses and
it's in a praline Dion which I thought
was kind of pretty sounding because i
love pralines it's not sticky at all it
has a really nice smell it is kind of
thick so it does stay on a little bit
longer which is nice I don't really care
for the packaging of this as much as I
like the other packaging for their other
products but I don't really care
isn't that big of a deal the product is
really what means a lot to me but I
really like this lip gloss I like the
quality of it and I would definitely be
purchasing more of these and i highly
recommend her he wins for rain husbands
the next thing I bought was a huge mess
huge fail huge fit and it was these I
don't know if you've seen these in other
videos but a friend of mine recommended
that I get these and I have been staying
away from them because they look to me
like a philosophy um like like
philosophy packaging like they're trying
to copy a philosophy like a like a like
a designer imposters I don't know if you
guys even though I'm talking about but
there used to be a perfume called
designer imposters and and it was dupes
for high-end fragrances right there ever
straight brazilian keratin therapy
shampoo and conditioner an exclusive
blends antioxidant rich coconut oil
along with lush keratin proteins to
strengthen and soften the hair while
avocado oil and cocoa butter smooth the
cuticle four straight strong tresses
adding a brilliant glow and luminescent
shine okay the shampoo I don't like
shampoos that don't whether it bothers
me like I feel like my hair is not
getting clean and it takes me like three
times my hair is like super dirty or
something but or super oily I don't know
what's going on but it takes like three
times washing my hair with this stuff
for me to feel like my hair is clean now
the conditioner it says that you're
supposed to leave this on for three to
five minutes and i will tell you that my
L'Oreal sulfate free shampoo I'll put a
picture here that one when I put that on
my hair and then I rinse it right off it
makes my hair or reidiculous in that
softer silkier stronger all that than
this
on for three to five minutes I am sat i
don't know i'm going to try to pass this
on to somebody say if somebody else
wants it but i am not i don't even want
to use it anymore if it doesn't work I
mean I hate not using something that I
bought but I don't think I even told you
this is by a company called organics you
need pure and simple I've heard negative
things about the other um the other
products in this I was going to get the
argan oil one because I just gotten the
pure argan oil and I want an argan oil
shampoo to go and conditioner to go with
my regular argan oil but they were out
of conditioner so I didn't get that one
but I don't think because I so did not
like these i will not be buying the
argan oil in trying that that version of
this so let me know if you've had a more
positive experience with these or if
you've had a negative experience with
these maybe it's just me maybe I'm just
not good at testing shampoos and I don't
know okay the last thing that I got um I
told you about in my addiction video was
not a vice palette oh how i love the
lice palette now you know or at least
you know that other people like The
Naked 2 palette you know you might know
how much I love my naked 2 palette this
I wouldn't say this rivals it but there
are colors in here that of course are
not in The Naked palette there's some
colors that are not natural so they
wouldn't be in The Naked palette but
there are colors in here now I use just
as much as the ones i've used in my
naked 2 palette so that's one of the
reasons why i'm on an eyeshadow know by
right now because there are so many good
colors in here that i absolutely love i
can go into a full review of this if you
want but i i'm not going to do that
right now just because i don't want this
video to be ridiculously long i will
tell you that my favorite color in here
right now is news which is this very
dark right there it's this very dark
brown color and it's got some shimmer in
it i absolutely love this color because
it
really nice darkening outer corner color
and if I'm going for a really a smokier
look I put it I've been putting it like
just hair gently in my crease absolutely
love it I love the way it blends it's
really smooth it stays on I mean is just
a gorgeous deep brown and it's a
different shade of dark brown than I
have in other palettes and other shadows
oh you know which one is weird that's my
second favorite it's this one which look
it's this one it's called blitz and
never in a million years but I've ever
bought the shadow alone there's no way
it is like a Gibran like a gold it's a
gold coin I don't like go I'm not a gold
kind of girl but this color is gorgeous
it is so silky beautiful and one of the
reasons why i love this is it's kind of
like a gold version of birth you have
the Naked 2 palette verb is like a
silvery metallic and this is like a gold
metallic um and it's just beautiful I
could go on or about the vice palette
and if you want me to do more about the
vice palette I'll do a video just in the
vice palette but there's so much out
there about the vice palette so I wasn't
sure if you guys would be interested in
