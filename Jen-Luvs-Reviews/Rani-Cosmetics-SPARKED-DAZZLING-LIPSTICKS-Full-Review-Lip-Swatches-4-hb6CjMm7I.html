review of the Ronnie Cosmetics lipstick
line I cannot wait to tell you about all
of these colors this week on the channel
I have two brands that I'm going to be
spotlighting for you that are created by
youtubers so the first one where we're
going to start is with irani cosmetics
by E Shani from total makeup junkie 101
the next video is going to be about the
spray line from KL polished by Kathleen
light we're going to start off with
Ronnie cosmetics now Shani from total
makeup junkie 101 if you do not know she
is a youtuber that focuses mostly on
reviews I have looked up to her ever
since I found her channel I fangirled
like crazy when I met her at generation
Beauty in Los Angeles and we actually
ended up spending quite a bit of time
together and now we have each other so
numbers and we don't talk all that often
but I do want to disclose that these
were sent to me by ishani but as you
know that does not influence my review
at all just as she is 100% completely
honest in her reviews so am I and I
don't think she would expect any less
from me than what she gives to her
audience so I'm going to be 100% honest
with you I absolutely promise so let's
talk a little bit about the brand in
general so first Ronnie a means Queen in
the traditional Indian language Ronnie
cosmetics was born from the idea that
each and every person should feel like
royalty that is off of their website
everything is made in the United States
products are cruelty free and completely
vegan and also paraben free I add that
part because I didn't see any parabens
in the ingredients these are called
sparked dazzling lipsticks and this is
the outer packaging it's kind of a henna
looking print and then you got the Rani
cosmetics feather on the top that is
like a purple shiny thing there and then
we've got the holographic here on the
bottom you have the shade name and then
inside the packaging it looks like this
and it says Rani cosmetics it's got the
little feather and then the henna print
on the bottom it is white plastic
packaging and then you open it up and
you've got this pretty rose gold
underneath
and the lipstick rolls up just like that
traditional lipstick way these are $18
each or they are $99 for the bundle of
six a little bit about the ingredients
that are in these they are castor oil
base that is the number one ingredient
number two is something called
Catholic or Caprica triglyceride it is
derived from coconut oil and glycerine
glycerine ZAR really nice like skin
balancing ingredient so it kind of helps
to bring your your moisture level to the
right level so that's really nice to see
that that in there and then I'm not
going to try to pronounce this one but
that's also a skin conditioning agent
that is in the lipstick that's number
five on the ingredient decks
there's something called Austrade which
is a type of paraffin wax there's silica
coconut oil and mango seed butter in all
of the lipsticks now there are some
irritation concerns for a couple of the
ingredients if you've never had an
allergic reaction to lipsticks before
then this may not bother you but if you
have listen up
so it has propylene glycol tocopherol
acetate which is a form of vitamin E and
BHT two of the pigments have
bioaccumulation concerns on them
ci one nine one 400 which is a yellow
pigment and then red 30 Lake so if any
of that bothers you you definitely don't
want to get these you can probably
contact Ronnie cosmetics on the pigments
to see which lipsticks have which
pigments in them it just says may or may
not on the ingredient list it's not
specific the way that they listed on the
website which pigments are in which one
these are very common pigments found in
cosmetics but if you personally have a
problem with them I'm sure Ronnie
cosmetics could help you out to let you
know which ones have it so let's go
ahead into my soul review now the first
thing when I heard from me Shawny that
these all had glitter in it I was
thinking oh my gosh what are you
thinking what are you doing this is a
horrible idea why would you do that
because I have had lip products with
glitter in them before and one of the
big problems I have with them is that
the glitter hangs around longer than the
lipstick and you end up with a film of
glitter on your lips and no lipstick
left and it looks really weird what I
will tell you though is when they wear
down naturally the glitter seems to wear
down with the lipstick which I was
really excited to see one thing that's
advertised on the website about all the
lipstick is that they are a sheer wash
of color and once
life and then you can build them up to
full opacity I personally don't like the
way they look in the more sheer version
because of the glitter it just looks
kind of weird to me like it just doesn't
I don't know I like them at full opacity
there would be no way that any of them I
would wear with just one swipe I just
don't like the way that it looks all the
swatches that you're going to see in a
minute they are all up to full opacity
another thing you need to know about all
of these lipsticks is they are
advertised to have a subtle scent each
lipstick shade has its own unique scent
now I know that so many of you are
sensitive to fragrances and sensitive to
scent but I found that some of them are
stronger than others so the ones that I
found that were less strong were tattoo
lassie Eclipse and bindi and then the
stronger ones are syrup and latte now
syrup I feel like is the strongest one
as far as scent that's the rose scented
one which makes me really sad because
that's really my favorite shade out of
the line and I really don't like rose
scents on my lips biologically I feel
like in my gut I want it to be something
that I can eat so like my nose is like
no get that away from your face it's not
edible even though I know some roses are
edible my mind is telling me no I don't
want that on my lips so I'm kind of sad
that that's my favorite shade it's got
the road something that I don't like and
it's the strongest scent but I deal with
it I'm wearing it today actually I have
a mixture of syrup and Eclipse on my
lips right now
syrup looked weird with this shirt so I
put a little clips on top to balance it
out and I like the way it looks so let's
go through each one one by one and show
you the swatches so first we have tattoo
it's advertised as a universal pinky
nude base laced with pink shimmer
infused with a subtle caramel cream
scent this one I don't really see the
pink in it I see more of a kind of a
peachy bronze kind of shade it really is
more of a bronze I don't see a pink in
it at all just so you know this is
that's just my experience with it it's
very warm toned and the scent is very
very subtle on this that caramel cream
scent I do really like tattoo with the
right look I've worn tattoo quite often
and I do enjoy it on my skintone one I
forgot to mention before we do the next
is that these were specifically designed
for medium to deep skin tones me having
a light to medium skin tone more on the
light side I realize that these shades
were not developed specifically for me
and I'm not crying about it there are
plenty of lipstick lines that were
designed more for lighter skinned people
so I'm not crying about it but I'll tell
you that some of these I don't prefer my
skin tone just like the next one this
one is called Lassie
and they really don't like this one on
me it is not me at all it's not my
favorite it's a vibrant red orange base
laced with gold and pink shimmer and
fused with a subtle mango scent and you
know there are a lot of people that like
this kind of shade but it's just not for
me the mango scent is you can smell it
but it's not very strong at all it's a
little bit stronger than the caramel
scent next up I'll show you the swatch
of syrup which again is my personal
favorite I really love this shade syrup
is described as a true fuchsia pink base
laced with gold and pink shimmer and if
used with a subtle rose scent and like I
mentioned this does have a stronger rose
scent which makes me a little bit so but
that's the way it ended up coming out
but it's not a deal-breaker for me it
may be a deal-breaker for you it's not
for me I'm still going to wear it a lot
just because I love the shade Eclipse is
the next one and I kind of have a
love-hate relationship with this
particular shade range this color of
this deep purpley blue kind of shade I
really want to love it I really want to
wear it I like it when I wear it but I
get scared to wear it because I am so
fair compared to the shade I feel like
it makes me look very pale and I just I
don't know I kind of like it and then I
kind of don't on me just as a personal
opinion it is a vampy dark purple base
laced with pink shimmer it's infused
with a subtle coconut scent and this one
is also very subtle it's similar to the
caramel as far as the subtlety of it
next up we have latte and latte is a
sultry chocolate brown base laced with
subtle violet and blue reflex and to use
with a subtle chai latte scent this one
I would never have thought to put purple
and blue with this kind of shade of
brown but I personally feel like it
works I think it's very interesting and
unique I've never
anything close to something like this
and I think it's really interesting and
that's what I really love about the
shade I've worn la say quite a bit as
well that's probably my second most worn
shade after syrup and I enjoy it a lot I
really like it and the last one is bindi
now don't be fooled by the bottom of
bindi the bottom label is totally
different than what the lipstick looks
like in the swatch and on the whip it is
a classic medium red base laced with
gold and pink shimmer it's infused with
subtle strawberries and cream scent I
feel like this has a lot of pink in it
it's more of a medium pink to me than a
medium red the scent is a little bit
stronger it's kind of medium in the
strength of it it's less than the Rose
but more than some of the others and it
does smell very very nice I do like this
one with the right look I like it is a
nice bright summer color I don't think
I'll be wearing this in the fall in
winter but this one will definitely be
one that I wear as it warms up because I
do really like these brighter pinks in
the summertime so now I'm going to show
you the swatch of all of these all
together now if you look at them there
really isn't a ton of difference between
syrup and bindhi syrup is a little bit
more purple tone where bindi is a little
bit more red toad they're very similar I
thought they're different enough on the
lips that you won't feel like you've got
two of the same thing but just you know
they're very similar the rest are very
very different so now the question is
who are these lipsticks good for these
lipsticks are good for people that like
bright bold colors overall there's a lot
of color in this line it's not a new
line it also has glitter in it so if you
do not like glitter on your lips this
lipstick line is not going to be for you
whoo this is going to be for people that
like those bold unique looks that let
their lips to have some shine on it
maybe girls go into the club want their
lips to be a little glittery you know
things like that without having at a
topical glitter to it that may may end
up eating I mean the glitter in this is
very very fine so it's a way for your
lips to have that glitter without
feeling like you're just covered in
glitter another thing people have asked
me about this line is if you can feel
the glitter as you're applying it on
your lips and you can just the time
that you can feel the grit of the
lipstick it's not super smooth in the
way it feels when you apply it but when
I go like this with my lips I can't feel
any glitter at all it's only in that
initial application process another
thing I wanted to mention is that some
of these lipsticks do stain the lip so
you
hey I'm going to take my towel and just
kind of show you
how they we're all so as you can see
there is some left behind so especially
the reddish shades so we're talking
about syrup eclipse and bindi those are
the ones that stain the most the rest of
them don't really stain a lot but just
keep in mind that after you the lipstick
and after it comes off completely your
lips probably will still be pink I do
want to give ishani props for creating a
lipstick formula that I don't feel like
is anywhere else it's very difficult in
the makeup world today to do something
that's unique and I truly feel like she
has done that and I am so incredibly
proud of her and her efforts toward this
I'm really looking forward to seeing
what she does next with the line I to
nose and one thing that's really great
about having a makeup reviewer creating
makeup is that she knows what she likes
because she's tried so many products she
also reads your comments on her video so
she knows what you like if you watch her
channel I definitely recommend checking
it out if you've never seen her channel
before she is definitely one of my
youtube inspirations and I absolutely
adore her is a lipstick line perfect no
absolutely not I don't think that it's
going to be for everybody but there is
definitely an audience that I think will
absolutely love them so I want to thank
you so much for watching this video I
hope you enjoyed it if you did
