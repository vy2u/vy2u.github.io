the brand new Ronnie Cosmetics sparks
dazzling liquid lipsticks I have so much
to share with you these are so fun and
unique and I cannot wait to show them to
you if you watch my channel I really
hope that you are also subscribed to in
shawnee over at total makeup junkie 101
if you like my reviews you will like
hers as well she did send these to me
for review purposes this is not a
sponsor video in any way and just as a
Shaunie is very honest in her videos I
know she would expect no less from me
than complete 100% honesty so that is
what I'm going to be giving you today
she does already have some regular
lipsticks out I did do a full review on
those I will link that down below and
now she has come out with the liquid
lipstick version of her sparked dazzling
lipsticks there are six shades they are
$20 each they will be available on
Saturday July 22nd there's also going to
be a bundle price but that hasn't been
announced at the time that I'm filming
this video if it is available I will put
it in the description down below
Ronni Cosmetics is a cruelty free brand
the products are paraben free I noticed
when I was looking at the ingredients
that they are free of carmine which is a
common ingredient used to pigments red
makeup so red lipstick red blushes red
eyeshadows I noticed that there's no
carmine carmine is made from crushed
idols so I think these may be vegan but
I'm waiting to hear back a shot from
ishani on that but when I find out I
will make sure that it is added to this
video they are also made in the United
States which I know is important to a
lot of people talk a little bit about
the packaging in the Box if they come in
is the same as the sparked dazzling
lipstick box it is the holographic
packaging with the henna print says
Ronnie cosmetics here and you have the
shade name on the bottom there just a
little bit longer than the regular
lipsticks and then the liquid lipstick
packaging has this the white cap that
does have kind of a coating on it so
like I've gotten liquid lipstick on this
and then all you have to do is just wipe
it and it comes right off which is
really nice you have to worry about it
getting all gross and nasty and having
lipstick scenes on the top of you
lipstick and then also it has the Rani
cosmetics logo here the little Rani
feather here and then the shade name on
the bottom and the rose gold henna print
around where you can see the shade
through it which I really really like
that touch it's a little bit frosted in
a tube but it's you can definitely still
see prominently the shade through the
tube which i think is really nice as far
as value and there are six point eight
milliliters of product in these liquid
lipsticks that comes out to two dollars
and ninety four cents per milliliter at
that twenty dollar price point so that
put the pussy's like if they were sold
at Sephora this put seeds a little more
expensive than the Sephora brand but
less expensive than most of the liquid
lipsticks sold at Sephora for example
it's less expensive per milliliter than
the Kat Von D Tarte hood a beauty on
salvia and Cielo it is however a bit
more expensive per milliliter than the
Oprah and the Too Faced and the Sephora
brand liquid lipstick so these are a
fair price for a liquid lipstick of this
quality one thing I definitely want to
mention is that each one of these just
like the lipsticks has its individual
fragrance it has each individual scent
so if you do not like scented lip
products then you may want to stay away
from these I do want to let you know
though that they only have the cents at
least to me while they're wet so like
when you smell it out of the tube you
can smell it when you initially apply to
the lips you can smell it but right now
I've been wearing this for about 45
minutes I can't smell it at all
now that we've talked a little bit about
the products I'm going to go ahead and
show you some lip swatches with the
shade names and also their accompanying
scent right now hello my friends welcome
to your lip swatches so I watch these
Shaunie's video introducing her liquid
lipsticks I know it's a big part of it
was watching the liquid lipsticks and
lipsticks together so we're going to go
ahead and do that you'll also see the
scent and the shade description on the
screen to help you get more information
so let's go ahead and start with henna
and henna is a beautiful nude kind of
shade this one I feel like has a little
less prominent glitter but as you wear
it the glitter kind of pops out more the
scent for henna and tattoo is very mild
so if your senses a sense this may be
one you might be able to tolerate
and then when you put tattoo over top of
it it definitely gives even more glitter
over top so if you want the most subtle
look I would definitely recommend
getting the liquid lipstick in henna and
tattoo if you want a little bit more
glitter pairing them together will give
you kind of a happy medium between
moving on to rose and syrup this one
does have a very strong rose scent so if
you're sensitive to that you may want to
skip rose but it does go away after it
dries down now I really really really
love rose I like rose even better than
syrup I thought I liked syrup but man
they're just both really beautiful I
find it goes on super evenly and I
really like this one this one the
glitter does pop out a lot more than
with henna and when you layer syrup over
top it definitely has a straight-up glow
to it I'm not sure if it's coming off
across on camera how glittery this is
but it really is beautiful but it's so
fine of glitter it doesn't look like
something too crazy and wild but it is
really beautiful
moving on to Hindi and bindi and this is
one where I wove nd I really liked bindi
but I love Hindi and it's just such a
beautiful deep red and I don't know what
it is about the liquid lipstick formula
it just knocks my socks off it's just
really really nice Hindi and bindi there
another one with the scent where it's
very mild strawberries and cream really
really mild especially in the liquid
lipstick this one you can get it even
more opaque than what you're seeing here
if you layer on a second layer of the
liquid lipstick I find that they do
layer up to three layers before they
start getting a little chunky you really
shouldn't layer too many liquid
lipsticks more than three times but you
can layer this one a couple times and it
will be alright now layer with bindi
over top it just kind of adds a whole
new dimension to it I feel like this is
one if you're going to get a pair this
is one where I feel like the pair is
definitely worth it I think she's doing
a deal with you get both of the paired
shades together next up we have mango
and Luffy and it is pronounced Luffy not
lassie I keep messing that one up this
one is probably my least favorite shade
on me I'm just not a big fan of the
orange II Reds on me I've got a lot of
compliments on the way lusty looked on
me in the other video I'm still just not
a fan of the shade on me and that's just
a personal preference the glitter here
is very nice it's a little more subtle
than the last one but you can definitely
see the glitter in it you shani did a
great job with the mango scent on these
it definitely smells like mango but it's
not super strong when we chopped mango
with Luffy it does add a little bit more
glitter to it kind of like the first set
with henna and tattoo it kind of is the
best of both worlds when you have both
where if you have just Luffy by itself
it's pretty pretty glittery but then if
you pair that with the liquid lipstick
it just kind of softens it a bit another
one and that I really loved Eclipse I
actually liked lunar a bit less than I
like Eclipse lunar doesn't come off
completely opaque on one pass for me it
does on E Shaunie and I think that part
of the reason why is because my lips are
a lighter color than her lips so maybe
she just can't tell as big of a
difference then I can but I feel like
Luna really does need two coats in order
to be completely opaque this is one coat
though that I'm showing you right now
the glitter in this one is also very
very prominent the coconut scent in
lunar it reminds me of that typical
Beach coconut scent
and layering Eclipse on top I feel like
it definitely intensifies the glitter
and the shift in this one I feel like
there's just a really beautiful shift in
this combination this is another one
that I think would be great to get the
pair I don't know if you can see that
but you can really see that pink shift
in there it's beautiful I don't own
anything like this next up we've got
chai and latte this is one I've worn
quite a few times and get a lot of
compliments it really reminds me of the
first one in henna and tattoo in that
the glitter isn't as prominent in this
one until it wears down just a little
bit and as it wears down as some of that
moisture kind of evaporates the glitter
really comes through so what you're
seeing here is freshly applied you
really can't see the glitter that much
but I promise you as it wears down you
will see that glitter popping out more
the smell of chai has to be my absolute
favorite she nailed it if you put a cup
of chai and this liquid lipstick next to
each other you blindfolded me I'm
telling you I would not be able to tell
the difference it smells amazing
layering latte on top will definitely
add a little bit more of that glitter
punch there but again it's really not a
super sparkly one at least for me
two more parts left to this review we're
going to do a little ingredient analysis
and then we'll go into my personal
opinion so ingredient wise they look
fantastic there's absolutely no concerns
except for the fragrance and one other
ingredient which may be a deal-breaker
for some people and that ingredient is
called retinol palmitate it is a palm
oil derivative and some people I know do
not do palm oil because of environmental
reasons so if that's you these are out
unfortunately I do want to mention that
the retinol palmitate is listed or right
before fragrance so there isn't a lot of
retinol palmitate in this and I don't
know how much retinol palmitate you need
in order to have these negative effects
but I do feel like I have to tell you
about it because one of the things that
I found in my research is that there is
some research that suggests that retinol
palmitate is bad for pregnant women and
also it can increase your sun
sensitivity so that's a big Wawa
on these retinol palmitate is used in a
ton of products the big red flags in the
research that I did was retinol
palmitate in sunscreens so I don't know
how much it's going to be a bad thing in
a liquid lipstick but if it freaks you
out unfortunately these are going to be
a no for you now on to my full and very
honest review these are really really
good let me just say that first there
are some things that may be
deal-breakers for you but let's just get
into it so one thing I definitely want
you to know is that the formula is
consistent throughout all six liquid
lipsticks so when I say this this is
true for all of them where I've had some
liquid lipstick formulas at different
shades kind of act differently the
formula is very consistent here let's
start with initial application so when
you put them on they're very whippy they
kind of remind me of the bareMinerals
Gen nudes when you put them on you can
immediately smell the smell they feel
very smooth they feel very comfortable
good to go on I haven't seen any
bleeding they're relatively easy to
apply they do have a paddle applicator
it's instead of a regular doe foot which
I personally like because I feel like I
can get
up into my Cupid's bow really easily
that way I do find that they are a
little bit a formulas a little bit
chunky to apply it first like it doesn't
go on smooth but as soon as I kind of
mush my lips together then I feel like
it evens out very nicely I think that
you if you're having trouble with the
application of it with the applicator
you can always use a lip brush as well
one thing that is going to make some
people very very happy is in my personal
opinion they drive down completely and
are completely kiss proof ishani is not
claiming that they are kiss proof but
watch I'm wearing this for 45 minutes
and not even on the rim I can see like a
tiny tiny bit okay anything not even on
the rim but like a tiny tiny tiny little
bit on my hand there but I kissed my
husband multiple times I didn't make out
with them but I was like none one Lun
Lun Lun Lun la and like nothing came off
on him absolutely nothing so that's a
really good thing hey John John come
here for a second I need you come here I
may kiss your cheek
Mary yes okay come you ready are you
ready we're going to do the kiss test
right now turn in and okay you can see a
little bit
all right let's do I can kiss Lila's
cheek Lila come here okay so I'm sitting
here all right ready kissed mmm okay so
not on her cheek I guess it just comes
off on the one cheek and now this gives
Griff I guess at this point because he
definitely has lipstick on his cheek she
doesn't though so that's good so maybe
just one kiss and then the XS or
whatever comes off all right thank you I
appreciate your help
I love you okay Tony anyone John hey you
know it's your sister
what you can see my lipstick hasn't gone
anywhere even after I kissed my children
so that's a really good thing and as you
can see in the swatches the glitter on
these are absolutely gorgeous I don't
know how she got them in there to where
if you remove the lipstick the glitter
comes off with the lipstick I've done a
few glitter liquid lipstick lip gloss
kind of products and what usually
happens is when the color wipes away
you're stuck with this random glitter
all over your lips that you kind of have
to scrape off in order to get rid of it
that is not so with these it does remove
with the lipstick now this is the one
that it's going to be up to your own
personal preference because I think
liquid lipstick is one of those things
that's very personal I feel like when
you look at these liquid lipsticks up
close they can look a bit dry on the
lips so what I've done to kind of combat
that is I grab a creamy lip gloss not an
oily lip gloss but a creamy one kind of
like the bare minerals Gen nude lip
glosses that aren't they don't feel
super oily on the lips put that over top
and that will get you that hydrated look
but it does take away the kiss person s
to transfer proof Ness they do have a
really long lasting power like that I
did it yesterday with the shade rose
with this shade right here and I worked
really really well the last thing I was
still good it's just it didn't have that
kiss proof Ness when I ate dinner it
kind of ended up being kind of a mess
and I had to remove it so it wasn't like
all over the place it might just be that
my lips are always dry all the time I
did exfoliate my lips before I did any
of this so I know that it's not that
there's like random dry lip parts on my
lips it's just that my lips always are
just naturally like that a note that he
Shaunie sent me about these if you do
purchase E she says due to the unique
shimmer pigments in the sparkling liquid
lipstick formula the ingredients may
settle over time so if that happens to
happen for optimal color payoff you're
supposed to shake them and also take the
wand and kind of stir it inside in order
to get that original spark dazzling look
but even with all of that I really love
these liquid lipsticks the formula to me
is pretty stinkin amazing I personally
prefer a little more of a whippy formula
that kind of stays more hydrated that
isn't as transfer proof because that's
my personal preference but I think that
this is going to meet the needs of more
people than what I like if you're living
people tend to really like that kiss
proof transfer proof long-wearing
liquid lipstick formula and that's what
this is so I think that I'm in the
minority and that I prefer the ones that
are a little
it more hydrating and a little less
staying power you know what I mean are
they perfect in my opinion no they're
not perfect but depending on you and
your personal preferences they may be
perfect for you so you just have to
decide what you like based on the
information I've given you and also I
will link Shaunie's video introducing
liquid lipsticks down below that will be
great especially if you have a deeper
skin tone to you she is a medium skin
tone so you'll be able to feel a little
bit better on someone that's deeper than
