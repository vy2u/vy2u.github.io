the new Coastal Scents revealed smoky
palette alright I am so excited to
review this for you I am so thankful to
Coastal Scents for sending this to me
for review I was a little nervous after
the revealed 3 review um I kind of
didn't like the reveal 3 so I thought
Coastal Scents had given up on me but it
turns out they didn't because they sent
me the revealed smokey palette this is
the outer packaging this is the way that
it looks on the back and then this is
the revealed smoky palette this is the
fourth in the revealed series from a
coastal sense it is 1995 is how much it
will cost on December 11th which is the
release date this is the revealed one
with the original revealed palette and
you can see let me put the shades up
here here are the shades you can see
there are some similar tones in there to
the Urban Decay Naked one and this was
actually my favorite of the revealed
palettes of the one two and three this
is the Naked 2 so there are some shades
similarities in the this is still the
revealed original and then this is the
Naked 2 by Urban Decay this is the
revealed and the Urban Decay Naked 3
there are a lot of differences between
the revealed 2 and the Naked 3 palette
maybe a couple of similarities but not a
whole lot now then the revealed 3 came
out and there really wasn't a comparable
naked release right around that and you
can see this was my definitely my least
favorite of the 3 there were some chalky
shades in here the color scheme was
really weird for me I'll link all of my
reveal wood reviews down below this one
was also sent to me for review as was
they revealed to the original reveal
palette I think I got in a boxy charm
but yes so this was my least favorite
one now let's check out the revealed
smoky palette now I will tell you before
I show you the revealed smoky palette
that I have the
milt smoky palette on one eye and the
urban decay naked smoky palette on the
other eye so check that out see what you
think okay I'll show you the swatches of
both palettes let me put you up close
one side is revealed smoky one is Urban
Decay smoky okay here is a shade that's
very similar to my skin tone so that is
that I'm not gonna tell you which ones
which yet
alright so revealed smokey looks like
this okay and I didn't swatch all of the
shades on my arm I just watched the ones
that looked similar because there's only
there's only 12 shadows in the Urban
Decay Naked smoky so I only swatch 12 of
these shades on my arm and you can see
about the swatches there are some
there's some dupes going on there's some
new penis but there's also some extra
colors in the reveal that you don't get
in the urban decay smokey you can see my
camera hello camera look it's me
watching you watching me watching you so
I will tell you that the swatches on my
right are from the revealed smokey
palette these over here are from the
Urban Decay smoky palette on this side I
have from the revealed smoky palette on
this side is from the Urban Decay smoky
palette and I can tell you as I was
placing the shadows on my eyes I saw
absolutely no difference in the
application of the shadows and I would
tell you if there was a difference in
application you know I am honest with
you there was no difference in
application there's also no difference
as far as wear time either I have tried
this I use this four times before this
review
I've used this twice before the review
or haven't used this quite as much but I
can tell you that the wear time is
excellent on these shadows are you
blowing away yet I I don't know I'm
blown away I can tell you this is my
absolute favorite of the Coastal Scents
revealed palettes as far as the quality
of the shadows the quality of these
shadows somebody put a lot of love into
palate I think if you are a smokey lover
and you don't want to spend this even if
you do want to spend this honestly like
if you're not like this packaging is
incredibly gorgeous incredibly gorgeous
but if you are not hooked on that and
also the fact that this has a brush and
a mirror like you're getting that with
this you're not getting that with this
this has 20 shadows this has 12 shadows
in it this is 20 dollars this is 52
I believe the packaging is gorgeous for
a cardboard packaging it's gorgeous but
it ain't this like this is a whole
nother level but that's what you're
paying for with $52 is you're paying for
this packaging the quantity of shadows
just I can't even I can't even when i
swatched though I thought I was gonna
get like fallout and craziness with some
of these but I don't I really don't and
when you look at the dupes let's just
start at the top this one's called high
and you can see the one in the reveal it
is a little bit more champagne just a
tad bit more this one here is called
dirty sweet and that is pretty close
this one is called radar and you can see
this is the closest to a dupe that there
is in the reveal the smokey palette it's
not a dupe but it's kind of close you
could probably get the same kind of look
but this one's definitely deeper in the
revealed smokey this is called armor and
that is pretty much an exact dupe from
the revealed this is called slanted and
I feel like the one from the revealed is
actually more pigmented than the one
from Urban Decay and that crazy this one
is a dagger and I feel like this one
again is more pigmented from the
revealed and this one is definitely more
pigmented this is black market and
that's from the revealed I swatch this
and I was like that is like coal like
straight coal but it blends on the eye
it's crazy it actually blends very well
its smolder this is actually kind of a
purpley shade and I do feel like that
the colors are dupes but I do like the
revealed better this one is called
password over here now this is the only
one where I feel like urban decay beats
the revealed
feel like it's slightly more pigmented
but overall I mean there really isn't a
whole lot of difference it's not a deal
breaker for me and then down here this
is called whiskey now whisky is
definitely deeper than this shade but
that's the closest to a dupe that we
could get there this one that's close to
my skin tone is called combust and I do
feel like those are pretty close to
dupes and then down here is called 13 I
use these to blend out my brow bone
today and I really really like both of
them they're both awesome like they're
really are they're both fabulous shades
so I can't even I don't even have
anything else to say other than that
this is a huge win Coastal Scents you
knocked it out of the park this time I
haven't said that about any of the
reveal pallets that they are knocked out
of the park but this one is an exception
someone put a lot of love into this
palette trying to make it really
high-quality and again you also get 20
shadows versus the 12 with this so I
mean is it an exact dupe no there are
some shades that are not exact dupes but
I don't feel like it's enough of a
difference to be worth it to get this
over this unless you're dying over this
packaging and you really want this
security rather than the cardboard
packaging and this comes with a brush
and this does not this comes with a
mirror and this does not but if you're
just looking for eyeshadows BAM this one
is your baby right here very big
surprise at the end of this video since
