this beautiful box oh my goodness and
sunflowers and daisies are like my
favorite flowers so it makes me happy
and there's these little snacky-snack
ease in here okay let's see what we got

snack you and this one says the sneck is
on 95 calories Apple

nothing spectacular go something very
sweet and crunchy very fig newtons
Nidalee tasty and berries i'm feeling
these aren't going to be anything we
don't track for you too very soft though
creatively trying before i know but i
think they're better than phrases maybe
a steep softer than cravings pressure
crazy you know definitely I mean I saw
the next one I'll be good this this is
kylie jenner 21 gorge or George I think
it's gross whatever and cashews ish
there's cheese Cashin saw support next

a little dry oh good it's a nice little
snacky preference very flavorful salsa

stuck in my teeth that one okay and then
here's a cashew yes honey cheese cheese
cash on and just to try this that's good
I could get like a whole bag of the she
stashes it's like cheddar cheese has not
done that the same salsa flavor as the
other two cheddar cheese okay it really

cherry on some of these seeds and eat
them at the same time it'll be different
don't joke though
that's it for the graze box first box is
free after that it's five dollars a week
um I don't know the deal about canceling
it how all that works I have to look on
the website you could probably look on
the website by not yourself to how all
that works so what you go on the website
and you tell them like if there's things
you absolutely do not want you just mark
it as trash and they will never send it
to you and then you can put on either
you like it or love it or you would like
to try it on you know the different
snacks i think there's no neither put
snacks to choose from but yeah I think
it's I'm gonna get another box and see
what the next box is letting me if you
think about you get a bag of you know
whatever mix nuts or whenever at the
grocery store is gonna cost you five
dollars should this way you get to try
things that you can't really get in the
grocery store which is kind of nice it
comes with this thing here it says hello
I'm your free box stick around your
fifth box will be free too and then I
have four codes I'm gonna put those on
my facebook now and see if anybody grabs
them if nobody grabs him on my facebook
that i would put them in the downbar
below if you don't see them down there
down bar in the description box below if
you don't see them down there and then
that's because people on my facebook
scooped him up so go join my facebook so
you can find out about stuff like this
