share with you something that I was
mailed by a company called hip see the
thing about hip see had dances that
they're adjustable so when I wear
headbands especially the ones that are
just like the plastic that go across the
top I always hurt me behind my ears so
these kind do not do that because
they're adjustable and if you go on
their website you look at the pictures
honestly the pictures do not do them
justice so I got they sent me five of
them and I am going to do a giveaway see
I now that I got them I don't want to
give them away and I told them I was
like you know you're gonna send me so
many of them i might as well do a
giveaway with them so they sent me five
and i'm going to give away how many do I
have to give you all right I'm gonna
give away too I was gonna give away
three but I want to keep them them
give away till okay so let me show you
these these aren't so pretty and I'm
going to put on this black one because I
adjusted it now I've never worn these um
except for to try it on oh I probably
shouldn't pick the black one to show you
but let me show you how that looks super
cute right this one is um I forget the
names I'm up with the names right here
the names of the different designs but
i'll show you look how cute that is so
cute and sober so I mean this black when
you can wear with anything pretty much
now this is I promise you I'll just wash
my hair I'm not gross and I'm not
wearing them all day I'm not sweating in
them or anything show you this one I
thought this won't be really cute for
spring since spring will be here before
we know it so that's the way that one
looks okay and this one is gold love
that loving this one this one is pink
and has little rhinestones on it as my
hair gets more and more beat up the more
I take put on takeoff headbands but
there's that one with the rhinestones so
cute and it is a light pink I don't know
if that's transferring on camera but
it's a light pink and then
is the last one and this one I really
love because it's got the leg
multicolored so you can wear it with
lots of different things and there's
that one um actually let me show you a
close kind of weight the way that clasp
looks just like that that way and then
this way I've never worn one of these
all day because I don't know which ones
are going to be going for the giveaway
um but my only complaint so far about
the hep-c headbands as I do feel like
they are a little on the expensive side
I think they're anywhere from fifteen
dollars to $22 for one headband and they
do seem like they are very good quality
they are definitely stuck together very
very well and they all have kind of a
soft backing here which is nice so thank
you so much hip see for sending me these
I really appreciate it I'm going to be
giving away two of these and this is the
thing I will let you pick which ones you
want okay I'll keep the ones you don't
want I like them all so I don't care
which ones I get put a comment down
below telling me which headband do you
would like and just pick one because I'm
going to have two winners of this
giveaway mad love and I'll see you in
the next video I'm son no not 16 shadows
but 32 tart I shadows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
