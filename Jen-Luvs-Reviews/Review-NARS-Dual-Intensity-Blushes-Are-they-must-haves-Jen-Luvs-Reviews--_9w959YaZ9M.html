you
hell on my friends welcome to my review
of the new NARS dual intensity blushes
now they do already have dual intensity
I shadows now they've come out with dual
intensity blushes and the whole thing
about dual intensity is that you can get
one intensity when they're dry and
another intensity when they are wet so
let's go ahead and start with this one
this is called abdur raishin and let me
show you okay so that's the way that
looks up close you can see that i have
been using it so there is that shade and
that one their hands watch Zoop and
that's how those low okay so just a
review on this one in particular this
shade is too crazy for me it's it's too
much it's it's it's pigmented dry it's
really pigmented wet like if you want to
audition to be a clown and this one is
going to be great for you go for it or
if you just can rock it somehow I
haven't figured out a way to do this one
and have it look good on me so this one
was a no for me this one however is a
gorgeous highlight it is absolutely
beautiful as a highlight so this one is
definitely a win for me I do use this
one dry I've used it wet but I feel like
there isn't a whole lot of difference to
be completely honest when this one's wet
versus dry and let me tell you about how
I use it wet um I watched a video by
Manny anyway who has blown up recently
on youtube at least I just recently
heard about him and now I hear about him
everywhere and he was saying to spray on
the the water on the actual palette and
I did not like doing that I liked better
to spray my brush so I'll grab a blush
brush or like this angle brush this is
from this is an angled kabuki from outer
beauty which is a brand that i
absolutely love where i'll spray it with
water you can just get a regular water
spray bottle or like I use this right
here this is the VNA thermal spring
water which is really great for some
people for their skin it didn't do much
for my skin so I just use it to spring
my brushes down and I didn't see much
difference with this one wet as far as
the intensity of it so this one I just
used dry very simple and it is a
gorgeous gorgeous highlight now this one
here this
I like a little bit better if I had to
pick between these two I would pick this
one just because I like both shades in
this this one is called fervor so that's
what that looks like up close and will
swatch those right next to the other two
I know I need to redo my nails I didn't
have time to redo them before filming so
you know it is what it is so there you
go those are those dry now I'm going to
just spray my fingers you know a little
bit wet again like I don't like spraying
it actually on the product plus I feel
like it's like compromising the product
even though I know it's not I feel like
it compromises the product so there's
the finger swatches wet and let me show
you the difference wet you see the
difference in intensity it's almost like
they're their cheek stains or cream
blushes when you use them wet I mean you
can totally tell the difference and
that's the difference that they are on
the cheeks as well as far as the
difference in intensity so I have
absolutely been loving loving loving
loving this especially as it gets
towards spring this is a really nice
transition from winter into spring it's
just deep enough to give you that like
you know that that deeper you know
winter kind of look where then you've
got the spring color to really brighten
it up so I really really like this a lot
and I think this one is a total win for
me I have tried both of these layered on
top of each other I still don't really
like this one because then it ends up
just shimmering up the brightness making
it that much more obnoxious but this one
I like them Laird as well where I can
see moving into spring maybe I'll use
this one a little bit more with this one
may be as kind of like on the bottom not
as a contour but just to kind of contour
a little bit you know just to have that
different shade there another thing i
want to mention this that i really
really like is the magnetic closure i
love that it's got a magnetic closure
and that's really nice for people that
travel a lot the packaging is very very
hard which is wonderful and I love the
mirror the mirror is fantastic so
packaging why is there a win now are
these a must-have I don't think they're
a must-have I think they're good I don't
think there must have what you have to
do really with these and see which
colors really speak to you go on some
look at some swatches see which ones are
calling to you and and yet which one
calls to you the most and and for me
it's this one right here I would
definitely recommend the one in fervor
