this with you and one of the reasons why
I want to share with you now is because
it is still on sale so if you want it
you can get it for like 40 or fifteen
dollars cheaper which is always a good
thing it is the tart I couture palette
it is fabulous and let me tell you why
it is fabulous first of all this
gorgeous packaging it's like this soft
um like squishy like quilty kind of
pattern and to get this cute little lock
and keys you get your 10 shadows you
also get an eyeliner pencil and it is
dual ended you get a black on one side
of brown on the other which I will show
you in a moment you also get an
eyeshadow brush that I gave to my mother
hi mom and as you can see they are very
large sized shadows compared to let's
say like an urban decay the first shadow
is a shimmery brown like light tan it's
a really nice brow bone color really
nice lid color if you go and light to
dark very nice and actually that kind of
applies for all four of these colors
they're all really nice light colors for
your lid this one is not quite as
pigmented as some of the other colors
that i have that are similar at the only
time i tend to use this one is if I'm
just pretty much using this palette
because I do i do like the one that is
similar it is cold your booty call and
the Naked 2 palette which I love this
here is a pink you can't really see the
pink in it unfortunately um unless you
are really looking super super close
that makes me a little bit set over here
it is a brown color with a gold glitter
the glitter is a very very tiny so you
don't get a lot of fallout which is nice
if you are gentle with these shadows all
of them you don't get a lot of Fallout
and it's not a very powdery shadow
they're very creamy and wonderful this
one here I personally don't use
not because I don't wear a lot of gold
don't think it looks great on me I think
if I had blue eyes it would look a lot
nicer but it is a beautiful highly
pigmented shadow and I do like it just
not necessarily on me this brown is also
very nice for an outer corner brown and
I'm actually wearing that today alright
so that's the top line there um you know
warmer kinds of colors then you get your
cooler colors down here you have a light
blue action going on it is has a little
bit of a green tinge but it's mostly a
light blue again not a really bright
colors if you blend it with other colors
are not be able to see it that well but
it is a nice nice lid color this one is
similar to this one but it is a little
peachy er this one probably has about
the same pigmentation as the other three
in this palette you're going to get a
nice lid color but you're not really
going to see a lot of the you're just
going to see a light color you're not
really going to see the peach very much
in that at least on my skin tone I don't
really see it moving over to this one
this one is a blue gray it is really has
a nice almost like a duochrome of blue
and gray which I really enjoy like that
one a lot this one here on the purple is
actually my least favorite and I love
purple shadows makes me sad this one
isn't quite as pigmented as the others
it goes on a little more powdery not
quite as solid of a color just not as
strong of a punch this black here does
have some glitter in it some silver
glitter it isn't the blackest black that
ever was I have a lot of blacks that are
much better than this kat von d's the
even that the wet and wild black the
Urban Decay blacks that I have are much
more black than this one there are times
when soft black works really nicely a
little bit about the pencil that it
comes with the pencil
is dual sided you get a black on one
side a brown on the other they are nice
pencils unfortunately I feel like I
really have to push to get it on my lid
when I did the swatch on my hand I felt
like it applied a lot easier than what I
tried to put it on my lid the staying
power on this is good it does last all
day which I like I it does not last
however in the water line I can't even
really get it to apply to my waterline
so what I decided to do is I want to see
if they compared to the Urban Decay
liners that i have so i did a swatch of
the black and i also to swatch up a
brown on the black urban decay is zero
the brown Urban Decay 24-7 liner is the
demolition one and those just apply so
much easier and so much nicer that I
would definitely purchase the Urban
Decay over the tart liners at this point
not a bad liner just not a WoW liner so
right now these this palette is on sale
at the tart website for thirty dollars
which is an amazing price for ten
shadows heading foot size shadows good
quality shutters and the dual liner and
the brush for thirty dollars i mean
that's just amazing they have a lot of
other good stuff in their sales section
two if this tile is particularly appeal
to you there are a lot of other really
good palettes and products on sale there
you might want to check it out how much
longer it's going to be going on so
overall good palette not my favorite
palette if i were to create this palette
for them i would say less of the very
light colors because they are all
relatively similar when they're actually
on your lid and some more mid shade
colors i would have appreciated a little
bit more anything else i want to say I
wish I were more witty in this video I
don't feel like I'm very witty of funny
funny looking maybe I'm not very funny
no I want to be funny to say today
what's up with that what's up with my
lack of wit today these are all shimmer
shimmery shiny kind of shadows so if you
don't day on that then visiting
is not going to be for you you might
want to find something else if you like
the shimmery shadows you will probably
like this they are very creamy most of
them are very pigmented i think it is
definitely worth thirty dollars if you
are in the market for shadow such as
these alright i hope you enjoyed this
