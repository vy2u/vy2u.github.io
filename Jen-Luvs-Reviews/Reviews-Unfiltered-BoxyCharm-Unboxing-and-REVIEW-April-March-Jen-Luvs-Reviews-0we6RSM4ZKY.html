it's one of those things where you
either love to enjoy that surprise every
month you like getting a lot of cosmetic
products for a less expensive price or
you're somebody that doesn't like slot
machines here's somebody that doesn't
like to spend your money not knowing
what you're gonna get stuff you actually
use or not so this month we are going to
go into dig deep into the April
boxycharm box I'm gonna give you my full
review on almost all of the products
inside and we'll be talking about the
May box of what we're going to be
reviewing in June so if that sounds good
to you hang tight we're getting into it
right now if you are not familiar with
boxycharm it is a $21 a month
subscription service you get makeup and
skincare items it's always over $100 in
retail value of products but like I
mentioned in the intro it's really
whether it's worth that $21 to use so
we're gonna be talking about whether
it's worth it to me or not this is
always sent to me for review a from
boxycharm I am obligated to review it
but I am not being paid for this video
some months or hits summer misses
boxycharm loves me no matter what I say
as long as I am fair and honest and that
is why I have loved boxycharm for many
years they love me just the way I am so
we're gonna go ahead and start with the
product that I did not try this is the
Porsche no more a vacuum cleaner pore
purifying mask I did not feel that I
should use this product I decided I
wanted to do it for a giveaway because I
don't really need a pore purifying mask
but when I first opened it my instinct
was just to give it away
so Cheyenne who I have already contacted
and has contacted me is going to be the
winner of this I'm going to be mailing
this out to her ASAP thank you to
everybody that entered the giveaway many
more giveaways to come I don't usually
announce them ahead of time very rarely
do I announce them big are usually just
randomly pop up in my videos so that was
one of them so Cheyenne you're getting
this one thing I did notice in the
ingredients is that there is denatured
alcohol in this so I would not recommend
using
as a daily product hello editing Jen
here so as I was watching this in
editing I realized I really didn't do a
good job explaining this product yes it
does have denatured alcohol in it which
messes with your skin's ability to turn
over skin cells but what I didn't
mention is it does include a a chaise
and be a chaise so it does have glycolic
acid and that really does help to shed
the dead skin to renew the skin surface
and it also helps to reduce the
appearance of fine lines it stimulates
collagen and elastin production in your
skin and it really is especially good
for dry skin but there's also salicylic
acid in there which is a DHA and this
not only helps with the surface of your
skin but also within your pores so it's
especially good for oily skin and it can
help reduce breakouts
there's also O linoleic acid in here
which is an antioxidant so even though
it does have that denatured alcohol in
there which is bad for the skin it has a
lot of really good cell turnover
ingredients in there that may help
counteract that denatured alcohol
there's two other ingredients that I
wanted to mention one is lavender oil it
is kind of high up on the ingredient
list some people say that it is a skin
sensitizer based on research but then
others say the research showing that as
a skin sensitizer was misinterpreted so
it's up to you the last time I mentioned
this I did have a couple of people in
the comments say that they are sensitive
to lavender oil so just want to let you
know that that's in there also there's
something in here called a meth own
glycerin acetal and that's a menthol
derivative so it may give you that
cooling effect on your skin I couldn't
find any skin benefits to this
ingredient it's more of that cooling
feeling on your skin I know some people
don't like that so I wanted to mention
it so now I feel like I've done my due
diligence in explaining this skincare
product let's go ahead and get to the
rest of the video and that actually is
the recommendation by dr. Brandt as well
it says you use no more than two to
three times a week for maximum results
and I definitely agree with that so
let's go ahead and move on to the
products that I can tell you about and
we're gonna talk about what I have on my
eyes today and if the you had me at
hello by colour-pop pallets I was
pleasantly surprised by this palette I
have tried a lot of products from
colour-pop I did try they're pressed
shadows when they first came out in the
little wrecked
angular boxes I kind of like them some
of some of the shadows I liked more than
others but I wasn't SuperDuper impressed
this one actually I really really really
liked a lot it reminds me a lot of
morphe shadows it reminds me a lot of
that formula where they're really good
are they amazing are they blowing my
mind
no but the lasting power is really good
blend ability ease of use is good I
think for the price point it is very
good and that's in comparison with other
eyeshadow palettes at the same price
point in the drugstore you've got lots
of warm naturally looking shades in here
nothing that stands out as me going wow
it's amazing no dual Chrome's nothing
super unique but I am wearing it on my
eyes today and you can see that it does
give a beautiful look there's lots you
can do with this palette you can make it
a little deeper with this brown here you
can lighten it up it's not
overwhelmingly light so I do feel like
people of many skin tones will be able
to use this and again ease-of-use was
very good and lasting power was good and
I have no complaints about this I do
want to do the thing that I said I was
going to do if you don't know there's a
little controversy surrounding this
palette in that they reused the
packaging originally this was going to
be the kathleenlights lumina palette and
they changed it to the you had me at
hello palette they've reused the
packaging and then kathleenlights came
out with the dream street palette
instead but I wanted to peel off the
sticker here just to like because I just
liked the idea of having the
kathleenlights Lumina palette and it's
not oh oh oh what look it just says you
had me at hello there let's see is it
deeper do I need to dig deeper I think
that that it just sheared off I can't
get the sticker off oh oh it's coming
hold on
there's definitely something gold under
there there's something gold this is not
going to be easy to take off this is
something I feel like I'm gonna need
like an exacto knife or something to get
this off it is definitely not coming off
easily but there's something under there
I do you know what I'm not gonna waste
your time with it but chances are it
does say Lumina underneath this but I
think I might just leave it for now
anti-climactic
all right let's move on with our lives
it's really not that important the
shadows are what's important and I did
really like this palette another thing I
really liked that was a nice surprise
for me is the a des New York High
Definition liquid liquid lipstick this I
believe is in the shade Haute cocoa
which is or hot cocoa however you want
to say it but I had to look up on their
website to find the shade it looks like
they only have two shades this one and a
red one at least in my minimal research
that I did I really like this but this
is not a liquid lipstick in the
traditional form of liquid lipstick this
is a highly pigmented lip gloss the
sense of it is mildly sweet almost like
a vanilla ice creamy kind of scent it
smells very nice but it's not
overpoweringly sweet the texture of it
is thick but not heavy and it's
definitely not sticky this is probably
one of my favorite lip products that
I've gotten in a boxycharm like ever
I really like the over liquid lipsticks
we've gotten a few of those in the past
but other than that I can't remember
another lip product from boxycharm that
I really really like as much as this so
this was a huge win for me very
surprised one that I did not like as
much was the Tarte Pro glow liquid
highlighter I am wearing that on my
cheek today and I really think this
might be me it might be operator error I
just feel like it's very difficult to
work with it dries relatively quickly so
you have to work quickly I made the
mistake of tapping it onto my cheek and
then looking for my stippling brush and
by the time I got back it was like dried
onto my skin so just keep that in mind
it dries very quickly but my my
complaint about this is just the way
that it blends into the skin I just feel
like it more sits on top of the skin
rather than blends in it does have a
little bit of a sparkle to it just a tad
bit which I also don't like because I
feel like it accentuates the texture on
my skin which I don't have a lot of
textures so if you do have a lot of
texture
I wouldn't recommend this for you I'm
not I don't think that you would like it
I mean that's just my opinion from my
personal experience with it and and I
just didn't I didn't really like this
it's in the shade sparkler by the way
and it's just not my style so I will
probably pass this on to a friend that I
think could use this more than me and
the last thing in this box was the brow
by Tonya crooks the instant tinted brow
gel with microfibers and this is in the
shade brown hair number two I was really
nervous about this because when I pulled
it out it looked awfully light from my
hair color but I am wearing it today and
I really like this product I like that
the bristles are very short and I like
that it's not very thick because it
makes it easier to target where your
brows are the only thing is you
definitely need to have some brow hair
in order for this to work it needs
something to latch onto this is not
something that I think anyone could use
to physically make brows on the skin
you're gonna need some brow hairs but it
does fill in my brows very nicely it
reminds me of the Gimme brow by benefit
but I actually think I like this one a
little bit better because I do find that
the gel inside is a little bit more
opaque than the the benefit one I have
really liked it a lot I'm very much
enjoying it I was surprised because I've
tried products by the brow gal before
and I haven't really liked them very
much so the fact that this one was
impressive to me was a shock
so overall do I think this box was worth
$21 absolutely I definitely do the only
product in here that I didn't care for
which was one I thought I was going to
like was the tarte pro glow highlighter
i really liked everything else of course
I wouldn't have purchased the vacuum
cleaner I do feel like this one is quite
a bit over priced at $24 is the retail I
would Paige $18 for this I feel like it
would have its place on a shelf in
Sephora for a reasonable price but they
don't think it's up there with the
luxury lip products the brow gal at $22
mmm order line it's kind of borderline
hmm $22 would be a stretch I'd have to
be in a mood to buy this at $22 but
again very happy to get it in boxycharm
and then the you had me at hello palette
the retail price on this is $18 yeah
definitely I would definitely pay $18
for this if you go to the drugstore and
you look and see the eyeshadow palettes
that are available at the $12 $15 price
Frank they're not nearly as high-quality
as this and yeah definitely okay with
$18 here with this one so now that we've
talked about the
Apryl boxycharm let's go ahead and go
into the may boxycharm which is what i
will be reviewing before I leave at the
end of June more info on me leaving at
the end of June in a future video
Dondon thun thun bittersweet bittersweet
alright so this is how it came this is
interesting this is the cover effects
blurring primer I do like cover effects
primers I do find them to be overpriced
for what they are because they are
really expensive retail price
yeah thirty-eight dollars I think is
insane for a primer unless it really
really works for you but very thankful
to see this in box II trauma I've had
great luck with cover effects primers in
the past this is interesting it's a
collaboration with boxy trauma with the
brand Beauty creations I've had bad luck
with beauty creations in the past so I'm
really hoping that this one comes
through for me it's a long wear matte
lip gloss which is kind of weird I'm
gonna swatch this on my hand and see
what happens here because a gloss by
nature is not matte it's like the
opposite of matte so I'm curious to see
if this is a liquid lipstick where the
other one said that it was a liquid
lipstick and it was more of a gloss I'm
thinking this one's going to be more of
a liquid lipstick we will see it has a
fruity scent hope they get on my nose it
is a color that I would definitely
consider wearing I think that it would
look nice on me so I'm looking forward
to trying this out we've got a lot of
brushes by Aesthetica I'm going to try
to block out the fact that this looks
exactly like the first morphe brush that
I bought that I hated it's very weird
that I think that it would the way that
it was packed it has now made it a
little crooked which is a little bit
weird but we will weave again we will
try it we will try it and there's also
this little eye brush set there's three
brushes in here this one is a brow brush
they feel this one feels very synthetic
there's also a liner brush in here just
a little skinny liner brush that's also
very well it was crooked I just fixed it
I just kind of released the eye released
the Kraken and you know made it a little
bit straighter because it was very stiff
but now it seems softer now that I went
to it and then a browse pulley I can
imagine the conversation with boxycharm
in Aesthetica okay we've got an eye
brush set for you well what what's your
eye brush set look like it's a spoolie a
brow brush and a liner brush I think
we're gonna have to give people
something else because that's that's not
gonna fly
okay how about if we give them a face
brush sounds great like I can just
imagine that conversation happening
because I definitely think people would
have been disappointed just with this
but I think with this in there it makes
it more boxycharm light meaning that it
seems like it's a better value for what
you're getting so we will see ah I can
see the logic and it's all coming
together now it's all coming together I
can see why they wanted to include this
because they've also included this
pretty vulgar gel eyeliner I remember
when this came out it reminded me a lot
of the Tarte one that had come out where
they have like a feather brush that went
with it and it just it was reminiscent
of that and also of the one by storybook
cosmetics so let me kind of dig in here
I don't like that I have to dig so far
in here that's kind of weird I'm glad
they included the brush because not
everybody's gonna have a brush to apply
this it is going on very patchy but I
might just not have enough product on it
this is not I really don't like how deep
it is in there I mean I have to dig all
the way down inside to get to the
product and I I don't like that at all
but I'm gonna have to try different
brushes as well because this one is kind
of flopping around on my skin so it's
making it a little harder to draw a
straight line so I'll have to play with
this and I'll let you know there is one
more thing in here and this is by pure
and this is the sculptor palette I'm a
little nervous to see what's inside here
because they had given us like us face
sculpting palette before it had like a
neon orange blush and a highlighter and
like a like a reddish brown bronzer
thing in there so I'm nervous I'm hoping
that this is good this was that product
I actually have it right here
this is what it looked like see it's got
like the same kind of an old ripoli
business going on there but I was not a
fan of this product at all correct that
I did like the highlighter but that was
all I liked in it I can't get it open
what is happening alright the tape kind
of ripped the packaging a little bit
that might have been me being impatient
oh my gosh there's tape on the other
side too real
is that necessary it's not necessary
it's not all I'm doing is damaging the
packaging let us see you've probably
already seen it but let's see oh it
looks nice
that looks nice that might work and I
would imagine that would work for a lot
of skin tones of course not every skin
tone but a lot of skin tones oh it feels
very soft - I'm surprised because
usually pure products they don't have
they're not usually very soft usually
feel kind of powdery to me there's the
eye liner by the way it's already
smudging a little bit and there's the
liquid the matte lip gloss it's
definitely a liquid lipstick but yeah I
mean that looks nice we'll have to try
it we'll try it so final thoughts on the
May box am i excited about this box no I
am NOT excited about it
am i completely disappointed no I'm
excited about the cover effects primer
but other than that that's kind of the
only thing that I'm really interested in
in this box
overall maybe the liquid lipstick this
seems like it's gonna be difficult to
use I don't have super high hopes for
the brushes but we'll try and the
palettes i I'm interested am i excited
no am i interested yes that's that's
where I'm falling with this so we will
see in June we will see if you do get
boxycharm or if you don't get bhakti
trauma I'd love to know your thoughts
about these products in the comments
down below so we can all learn from you
in the collective brain of makeup
awesomeness where we help each other not
to buy crap and to buy things that are
totally worth it thank you again so much
for spending time with me mad love to
you and I will see you in a video very
very soon
