Barbie doll because I didn't really like
my Barbies that much I remember trying
to put makeup on my Barbie doll with my
crayon and it totally didn't work so I
tried my marker that works but not in a
good way
so I think for some of us that grew up
using Crayola crayons and markers seeing
Crayola makeup was quite exciting of
course some of us probably were like
that it showed you've now why is all
makeup juvenile but you know what it
comes down to is is this actual good
quality makeup that's worth purchasing
or is it a complete gimmick well
hopefully today we're going to find out
and we're gonna get started right now
hello my friend welcome to my Crayola
makeup first impression review if you
don't know this about me I'm gonna tell
you I don't like first impression
reviews but at this point if I wanted to
try this makeup and present any
information to you I needed to do a
first impression because if you didn't
see my announcement video we are going
to be leaving on a two-month road trip
as a family so it's either first
impression or nothing I went on a Sosa's
website I ordered a bunch of stuff I
added things to my cart thing you know
it's not gonna be that much and the next
thing I knew I had a hundred and
twenty-seven dollars worth of stuff I
was like okay I'll just do it whatever
and then I realized I accidentally
double ordered one item so there's
actually gonna be a giveaway for that
item when we get to it I'll let you know
stay tuned one thing that makes up for
is that it is free shipping
internationally and what I found out
when I got the stuff is it's also free
returns inside the package you do get a
free return label so all you need to do
is put your fill out the little form put
your returns back in the box seal it
back up tape the return label to the top
and you're done that's it you're good
just a little bit about this brand new
makeup brand it is sold exclusively at
ASOS you can't get it on any other
website or in any other stores the
products are made in France and they are
cruelty free vegan and talc free also
from looking at the packaging it looks
like there's no phenoxy at the
or parabens in here there's also no
bismuth oxychloride in any of these
products from glancing at it a lot of
the common allergens that I see in
makeup are not in these products which
was great to see so let me show you what
I got you show you got I can't wait
anymore okay so I everything looks like
crayons this is the highlighter stick I
haven't opened it yet I got it in the
shade shimmering blush oh that's not
really blush is it I was expecting it to
be pink I thought it was going to be a
blush i legit did but it's an iridescent
peachy pink highlight hmm very
interesting I don't know about that that
that it was not what I was expecting but
it's not super thick but it's got a
really neat shine on it I also got three
lip colors I got one in mahvelous and
fuzzy-wuzzy and then desert pink and
they do look like legit sharpened
crayons that is so cute they don't look
like they're that different colors
though let me swatch these babies real
quick and it looks like they're roll up
so that's good so desert pink mahvelous
and fuzzy wuzzy those are the shades
there and then I got one of the crayon
trios these are supposed to be suitable
for eyes or lips or face or wherever I
do want to let you know that there is
red 7 in here so these would not be FDA
approved for I use on the eyes in the
United States but since they are not
bound by those laws because they're a
product from EU regulations they don't
have to put that on here now one thing I
do want to mention about these is these
come down to $8 for each crayons $24 for
the set and NYX jumbo pencil czar 4
dollars and 49 cents if you're using
this as an eyeshadow base the NYX pencil
is going to be a much better deal
especially considering the size in here
you're getting point zero 7 ounces of
product or 2 grams and the NYX pencils
are 0.18 ounces so you're getting twice
as much product over twice as much
product in a NYX pencil as you are in
one of these and they're half the price
so these better outperform the NYX by a
lot if they would get my repurchase now
is the product accidentally got to of it
so this one is going to be for giveaway
I can't remember the website that I use
last time for the giveaway but because
that went so well and so many people
really really liked it I'm gonna go
ahead and do that kind of giveaway again
so the link will be in the video
description to enter the giveaway and
giveaway will end one week from today
you've got to let me know right away
once I contact you you have to let me
know right away or else I have to pick
somebody else we'll say within two days
because I've got to get you the prize
because I'm leaving so waiting way back
to these let's go ahead and swatch these
they're just black gray and white those
are the names of the shades so I'm just
gonna swatch them here so there's black
that's rule of look very creamy here's
the gray they have a little bit of a
sweet set which is kind of interesting
grey and then the white
well pigmentation is definitely there
creaminess is definitely there we'll
have to see how it performs on the face
we're gonna do a wear test today and
then finally of course you don't have to
get an eyeshadow palette so I decided to
get the mermaid one I wanted one that
was more colorful none of the pigments
in here would be considered not eye safe
in the FDA regulations but there are
some pigments in here that would not be
considered lip safe so keep that in mind
that's the outer packaging it's just
plastic it has a clip closure and then
inside you have a mirror that fills the
whole top and then all of these shadows
here it's hard to say how much product
is in each pan since all the pans are
different sizes okay so it's glued in
there but it's coming it's popping out
on the side yikes
so not very well made on the palette
though okay I'll go ahead and just
insert some swatches here I haven't
swatched it yet but I'll insert them for
you so you can see the finger and brush
swatches just very quickly
none of the shadows have any names or
numbers or anything on them so when we
do the demo is just gonna be willy-nilly
we're just gonna go crazy alright I'm
ready to put these things on my face I
cannot wait any longer so I'm gonna go
ahead and do my base and I'll be right
back alright base is done I've been
getting questions about what else is on
my face so very quickly primer is the
Too Faced hangover primer I use the
Revlon true blend and
that made in the shade m15 I did do a
full review on this I really like that
foundation where I will stain Matt this
is in the shade creamy natural and then
the revolution makeup conceal and define
full coverage concealer this is in the
shade at c5 and I do really like this as
well alright let's go ahead and zoom in
and let's see what we can do with these
products I really want to be able to
test this palette but there's no matte
shades in here and I would like to have
some matte shades I'm actually going out
on a date with my husband for my
birthday tonight we're going to go see a
play so I have to look kind of decent so
we'll set down a base with the Urban
Decay Naked basics too and that way if I
don't use any other colors then I'll
know anything happening with the colors
is directly related to the Crayola
product then after that we will do a
liner with the black I want to try to do
some black eyeliner with this we'll see
how it goes
maybe we'll smoke out a little bit with
this maybe I don't know I'm not sure if
we'll use the grey or not then I will do
some blush and then we'll do some
highlighter I'll probably leave off the
contour for tonight I don't know I
haven't decided yet and then we'll go
ahead and pop in with the lips and we'll
be done
let's do it alright you because I still
love you this way i'ma just keep my
buddies tie the girl to the nose come
I couldn't bring myself to say good good
yeah there's no good way
No
do
yeah
okay We Need to Talk because this this
black eye shadow I face cry top thingy
is not working as liner it's too soft
it's not I don't think it's meant for
that I think it's more of like a smudgy
kind of thing it is not good for what I
was trying to get it to do so I'm gonna
have to use another liner over top of it
she's gonna use this em cosmetics liner
it decent I don't think it's worth the
price but it's decent this is the brush
tip one the illustrative eyeliner
I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye
even
all right it's currently 407 I gotta go
I will see you at the end of the night
after my date with my husband I'll give
you a full review after we see how it
wears I don't want to repeat myself so
we'll talk all about that in just a
minute at the end of the night all right
it is now 11:09 in the p.m. we went to
our local dinner theater and we went to
go see Newsies and it was awesome
and the dancing made me tired like watch
and these men just clicking their heels
and all that stuff and it was just like
whoa I'm about to go to bed so I wanted
to show you the wear test on this stuff
and it's I'm sad to say it's not great I
can't say that I'm surprised but I'm sad
to say let's zoom it in okay let's start
with the positives so the positives are
that I don't have glitter fallout down
here which is very good because I didn't
use any glitter glue or anything so
that's good no glitter fallout here the
negatives well it's still kind of there
a little bit a little bit it looks like
a mushy mushy mushy goo on my eyes I
have no separation of color left
highlight is gone it's not there it's
not existent let me just make sure yep
no highlight left lipstick lipstick wore
down like a regular lipstick it wasn't
bad but definitely more regular lipstick
II rather than like liquid lipstick II
but very hydrating while it was on the
lips it was very nice
I had tapped a little bit of the lip
product onto my cheeks over top of a
powder blush that's gone as well with
the eye shadow I definitely have
creasing here hopefully that's
translating to the camera but definitely
some creasing happening that maybe the
the white base that I put down I don't
know but yeah definitely seen happening
as well let me go ahead and zoom out and
just give you my full review of all of
this application where time all of that
let's go ahead and just start with order
of applications so as far as these
crayons when I lay down the black as
eyeliner it didn't work because it was
too moist to lay down with powder I
think it's one of those where you're
gonna have to use just the crayons
or and without powder they don't really
mix with powders well the other thing is
because they are so moist I don't think
people with oily lids are going to like
these very much but if you have dry lids
you'll probably have a better shot I
have normal lids they were just okay for
me they're definitely not my favorite so
I know that this is part of the giveaway
it's free so if you win you still get to
try them and you can use them for
something probably I don't know but
they're really not great the eyeshadow
palette I feel like this reminds me of
like a drugstore eyeshadow palette I'm
not trying to insult the drugstore but
drugstore eyeshadows for the most part
the majority of them don't have good
lasting power and unfortunately this is
similar there are some good eyeshadows
you can get at the drugstore these are
not them and this is more expensive than
drugstore prices so if you're looking
for a 6-hour wear then you might enjoy
this I really really like this blue
shade down here I haven't of course
played with every shade in the palette
so there may be some other hits in here
but there's definitely some big messes
as far as lasting power goes I was very
disappointed in this shape because this
it's beautiful in the pan it's got this
really cool mermaidy shift to it and
it's just really disappointing on the
eye so this I am not happy with this
purchase and this isn't going to be a
recommend either unfortunately the
highlighter is absolutely gorgeous when
it first goes on I really like it but
it's gonna be one of those things you're
gonna need to reapply at least from this
first impression so throwing this in
your bag or your purse or whatever and
reapplying if necessary but if that's
too much for you this is gonna be an O
as well even though it really is
beautiful on the cheeks when you first
apply it just doesn't last long and
again it's got more of an oily texture
to it
so this is gonna be this is this one I
like better than the eye shadow crayons
but it's definitely not going to be like
a yes but you have to try this
okay the lip product of course I only
tried one of the lip products it's it's
probably my favorite thing out of all of
these things because it is creamy it is
comfortable but it is a typical kind of
lipstick it does
a mild sweet scent these also the eye
shadow crayons have a mild sweet scent I
did not exactly actually look at the
ingredients guess what I just noticed
below crayons the eye shadow crayons are
the exact same formula how funny is that
so these are that that's why there this
is a lip and cheek Ram and this is a
face crayon but they're the same formula
so that's why it feels so moist on the
eyes is because their lip sticks a weird
I don't know that was a really weird
choice like real if you're watching this
Crayola that was a weird choice I do not
think that was a good one because it's
gonna crease on the eyes and I would
imagine it would continue to crease on
the eyes because you're using a moist
lip product it's all coming together now
it all makes sense
oh my god so back to the lip products
this is probably my favorite thing just
because I do enjoy a little bit of this
scent there and it was a very pretty
color and it's comfortable it didn't
seem to dry out my lips lasting power is
just okay $12 I do find to be quite
expensive for it you're really paying
for the Crayola name but if there was
anything from this collection that I
could recommend it would be the lip
product oh my gosh just looked at the
highlighter stick it's almost the exact
same formula as the crayons
that's crazy that they did not get
creative with these formulas at all the
difference he the only big difference
between the highlighter stick and the
crayons is that they used something
called synthetic floor phlogopite I
think I pronounced that right it's
synthetic mica so it's gonna that's
what's gonna give it that extra
highlighting shimmer mica is also
slightly higher up there in the list
which again is gonna give more sparkle
but other than that it's basically the
same base in here yeah Crayola you might
want to go back to the drawing board on
that one it works for the lips but you
might want to tweak it a little bit for
the other products just a suggestion
this is really sad I'm sorry Crayola but
you can you can do better I know you can
I'm rooting for you and launch number
two I know it's a brand new brand but
yeah these are this is this stuff's not
good
it's really not I'd be a hundred
anything oh well you know I made the
review and I got the information to you
so therefore it was worth it because I
got you information if you end up
deciding to pick these up and trying
that try them definitely leave your
thoughts down in the comments below
