unboxings I asked you if you were sick
and tired of seeing these pop fun
Ponce's everywhere from YouTube to
Facebook to everywhere did you want me
to continue making them because the
Internet is saturated with fabfitfun
unboxings and I gave you permission I
said please if you never want to see
another fabfitfun unboxing on my channel
again thumbs down this video and
overwhelmingly I got way more thumbs up
than thumbs downs so as you can see
we're gonna be doing the summer fun fun
fit fab yes that's what it's called the
fabfitfun unboxing we're getting into it
right now before I tell you what is in
the summer fabfitfun box assuming you
haven't watched any other reviews
anywhere else on YouTube little
disclaimers this was sent to me by
fabfitfun and this is a sponsored video
because some companies are totally cool
with me being me and they still sponsor
my videos even though I'm honest
fabfitfun is one of those awesome
companies that loves me for me and we're
gonna dig into this to see whether it's
worth it for you to spend the money on
this let me tell you what this is though
this is a subscription box that come
seasonally so this is the summer box it
is available now for your purchase I do
have a discount code that will get you
$10 off of your first a box it is JG 10
and you were going to use this to get
$10 off of your first box I do not
profit off their use of the code my
payment with fabfitfun has been
completed at this point so whether you
buy or don't buy it does not affect me
at all and it is fashion Fitness
lifestyle kinds of products you'll
always get a makeup product in there and
the makeup product this month oh my
goodness or this season oh my goodness
wait till you see it I do have a
surprise though that was a surprise to
me this one came to my business address
and then this one came to my home
address and they are different because
fabfitfun changed things and they'll
now you now not me but they allow you to
pick items in your box instead of having
like the items where you could get this
or you could get that you can actually
pick which one you want now which i
think is awesome to be able to go on and
do that but I'll get to show you more of
those items live in in person one thing
they always include is a magazine
usually its newspaper and now they've
kind of upped their game to this glossy
paper which is very very nice and then
inside they talked about all of the
products the total value of this box for
your either $40 or $50 is between three
hundred twenty two dollars and three
hundred sixty eight dollars oh my gosh
but is it worth it to you and that's
what we're gonna figure out so the first
product choice is you can choose from
one of these makeup train cases or a
beach towel and I got two beach towels
so I got both colors we're gonna open up
this one and show you I will put the
images up so you can see what they look
like but I'm also going to kind of
unfold it and show you
it's got like a typical towel feeling
here but it's very very soft on the
other side that might be due to it being
brand new and I haven't bought a brand
new towel in a long time but it's so
cute it's got these little pineapples on
it and I really really like it a lot I
feel like with beach towels in the
summertime at least where I live
I could never have too many beach towels
because my kids are constantly going
outside playing with squirt guns and
hoses and all of that in the summer so
this is definitely a win and I'm very
thankful to have it or have them rather
thank-you fabfitfun I know it was a
mistake but thank you now the makeup
choice products are actually two
products from Tarte now one of them I
already owned so this one I'm going to
show you is the one that I already own
I'm actually going to save the other one
for a future giveaway in the fall I
should be hitting 20 million YouTube
views I did a big giveaway at 10 million
I'm gonna do another one at 20 million
so I'm gonna be saving this one for that
but I do want to tell you how I feel
about mine I've had this for quite a
while the highlighters in here are
wonderful I'm actually wearing on my
cheeks today this one called
if you can see that one I feel like
Tarts highlighters are very very
underrated I think they're fantastic I
do not like the cream contour product in
here I don't like that it's open so the
powder falls into it I don't like the
consistency of it I don't like the blend
ability I'm not a fan of that but I do
like the sculpt shade here for me for
contour I am enjoying that so out of the
six products in here I love five of them
I really think that you are going to
love this no matter what your skin tone
is because there are deeper colors in
here for people with deeper skin tones
there's lighter colors in here for
people with lighter skin tones and no
matter what your skin tone is whatever
shade doesn't match you you can use it
for eyeshadow you can use it to top over
your lips for a really cool like
shimmery effect on your lips if you like
that and I do love the little mirrors
here I think they're super cute and this
is a definite yes yes yes I love this
product I've loved it for a long time
oh my god love me a long time the other
choice products you have a choice
between that or this pair I tried this
for the first time today this pair this
is the sex kitten liner by Tarte I do
like they're so fine liner a little bit
better than this it seems to be the same
liquid inside it seemed to perform the
same but the pen part is thicker than
the so fine it's a little bit more
difficult to work with I personally am a
fan of thinner liners so this one I
don't like as much but it seems to be
really good so far I can't speak to the
lasting power of it because again this
is the first time I've used it I just
got this box in the mail I think two
days ago where the other one I've had
for a little bit longer the eyeshadow
palette I'm wearing the matte shades on
my eyes today I'm also wearing the new
fenty liquid on the lid part of my eye
but all of the matte shades that you see
are all from this palette first time
I've used it today so far so good there
is a lot of kick up when you tap your
brush in it there's a lot of powder that
comes out but that's not a no-go for me
and it is the pro to go and this is a
really nice little travel palette for
weekend trips and things I love that
there's the little pop of color in there
and it's just a really nice little
palette with the liner and every
I really feel like that one's gonna come
down to personal preference the next one
you have a choice between the LMS papaya
enzyme peel or the Orlando PITA play
Atmos Shield hair protectant treatment
spray I've got two of the elements
papaya peels so of course I had to do a
little ingredient analysis and find out
what was going on with this and whether
it actually had good ingredients in it
this is what I found out and I
immediately tweeted it because it was
like are you kidding me
remember this is called a papaya enzyme
peel there's no papaya in here there's
no Lube I own your own like hey LMS
where you put paya at papaya fly on here
papaya over here fly in here
apparently papaya can't come to the
ingredients right now but what can come
to the ingredients is pineapple there is
pineapple extract in here which has a
very similar enzyme to an enzyme in
papaya Brahma Lane is the enzyme that is
in here and that is in pineapple extract
but the enzyme in papaya extract is
called papain they are listed often
together because they are extremely
similar they both have skin soothing and
antioxidant properties and it's a gentle
option for exfoliation no papaya similar
to papaya but not papaya
hello editing Jen here I have good news
the papaya has been found my friends on
Twitter were like Jen papain is the
papaya extract and I was like yeah I
know but there's no papain and I was
insisting there was no papain and then I
went back and looked at the ingredient
list and what did I find
papain just so you know papaya enzyme
has been found no need to panic all is
well
let's move on with the rest of the video
other things of note very important
there's an ingredient in here called
propylene glycol that some people are
allergic to or are sensitive to so if
that's you you want to stay far away
from this because it is the second
ingredient if you have eczema you want
to make sure you
hatch test this first because it is most
likely to be irritating to people with
eczema and this should never be applied
to damaged or burned skin sunflower seed
oil is also prominent in this and
sunflower seed oil has been shown to
decrease water loss and enhance your
skin's barrier and the last thing in
here which is a great ingredient is
niacinamide it's been shown to reduce
the appearance of large pores even your
skintone reduce fine lines brighten
strengthen the skin's surface it's also
sometimes used in acne treatments
because of anti-inflammatory properties
now the next ingredient is the
phenoxyethanol which is the preservative
if you don't know cosmetic ingredients
must be listed in order of highest
concentration all the way down to lowest
concentration until it hits 1% once it
is at or below 1% of the entire product
they can list them in any order they
want so usually once I hit the
preservative I'm kind of like they're
probably we've probably hit that 1% line
so the things underneath that are the
milk protein fragrance the pineapple
extract are all probably below that 1%
line so what you're really dealing with
in here in this peel are the ingredients
that I just talked to you about the
propylene glycol the sunflower seed oil
and the niacinamide nice and white is a
fantastic ingredient sunflower seed oil
is also a really good ingredient so this
could be really good for the right
person for the wrong person this may not
be good so think about you take a second
and decide whether this one would be
good for you or not now I will speak
very quickly to my experience with this
I did use this one time it actually does
have a little bit of a pineapple scent
so I don't know maybe maybe I guess I
can kind of see where it might have a
papaya scent it's very low shinee in the
feeling of it when it's on your face it
definitely feels like a mask it feels
kind of slimy it's got a thickness to
the texture so you're supposed to leave
it on for i believe 10 minutes yes 10
minutes then you rinse it off I did
enjoy using this I don't like a lot of
textures on my face so the texture was a
little bit thick for me but it wasn't
unusual for a mask overall I do like
this product I think it's a good product
for me personally and I will continue to
use it next we have a choice between
three things we have the
sontee brighten up enzymatic face
rejuvenator or the magic loop resistance
band or the minor history post script
wallet I got the wallet and I also got
the Vasanti brighten up so let's talk
about the wallet first it is it's cute
it's very thin it feels very nice but
it's so thin I know me and I know I'm
going to rip this it's got a little ball
here and I am not patient enough I know
this thing is going to get ripped really
really quickly what this is going to be
nice for is if I go out with my husband
on a date and I just need my ID I can
throw this around my wrist maybe an ID
on a credit card
but this is definitely not something I
would use all the time just because of I
know I'm gonna ruin this that's just me
personally but it is really cute and it
seems to be well-made it's very soft and
I do like it but I I know I'm probably
not gonna use it that often
the Vasanti brighten up is a product
that I had gotten multiple times in
subscription boxes years ago if you
don't know I used to have a subscription
box channel mm-hmm and I used to open up
tons of subscription boxes and we got a
lot of these Vasanti brighten ups I
haven't used it in years it's been
awhile but I remembered really really
liking this and when I looked at the
ingredients I figured out why it is a
physical exfoliating cleanser meaning
that it has a little bit of grit to it
but it's very very fine it's not harsh
at all it does come out white and then
you can feel that very very slight sandy
grit as you rub it in a lot of these
ingredients they don't have a lot of
time to sit and seep into your skin but
something that's really gonna help with
that is the capital lick and capric type
glyceride it's very very high up in the
ingredient list and its whole job is to
help everything you seep into your skin
so along with that you have pomegranate
sterols and I looked at pomegranate
sterols and I just want to bathe in them
they sound amazing and I looked up some
really great research studies on it they
talked about how because it has those
high levels of vitamin C it helps to
repair sun damaged an aging skin it also
helps to extend the life of your cells
that produce collagen and elastin that's
what the studies say there's also jojoba
seed oil and jojoba seed oil is very
very similar to human sebum or human
whales that come out of our skin so if
you have really dry skin it helps to
replenish that and balance out your skin
through that jojoba oil this is
especially good for dry skin we also
have castor seed oil and the Hoba seed
oil and the castor seed oil can work as
gentle cleansers so based on looking at
the ingredients and my personal
experience with this product I really
really like this one a lot too and if I
had to choose between those three I
probably would have picked this one I'm
not sure if I'm pronouncing this right
but you have the choice between the
earth to y-yo ring the Javan era
marinella hawaiian black lava body
caviar or the aromatherapy Associates
distress muscle gel all right I got the
ring and I got the body lava so let's
talk about the ring first I haven't
opened this yet this says earth jewelry
calm so that's a little bit different
than what was on the thing there I don't
know if they're like sister companies or
something I'll know what's going on so
I'm just gonna go ahead and try this on
and see if it fits on any of my fingers
I got to take off my Gemini ring no so
that is how it looks on it's very cute
this is totally not my style though it
looks like two little eggs and that's
just not my thing I don't know I think
this is cute for the right person it's
just not my personal style I think it
looks weird like little boobs I don't
know it's weird so I probably wouldn't
have picked this one it looks like the
little balls are glued on there I can
see the glue down here this is just not
AI this one just isn't me but this one
oh oh my goodness this one was really
really fun I use this in the shower for
the first time this morning and I really
enjoyed it
I did a little research on this company
of course it is a mother and son team
and they make bath products so it is
leaping bunny certified they seem to be
really into the fact that they are
cruelty free and as natural as possible
there weren't a lot of chemically
looking ingredients ones that I couldn't
pronounce pretty much everything in here
was something that I could identify just
by reading it so we've got the sea salt
soybean oil honey coconut oil olive oil
charcoal powder fragrance and coffee
beans
flower oil castor seed oil green tea
extract aloe leaf juice and it's just a
packed with all kinds of really good
stuff the only thing in here that is
kind of like a it is the olive oil there
is a study that people were putting six
drops of olive oil onto one forearm two
twice daily for five weeks and the olive
oil damaged their skin barrier when used
that often so I definitely wouldn't
recommend using this daily once a week
maybe just because that olive oil
ingredient is a little bit weird I'm
personally a big fan of honey in my
skincare products I've read a lot of
great things about honey coconut oil you
have to decide whether that's a good
thing for you or not some people don't
like coconut oil in their products
soybean oil some people are allergic so
be careful if you are but there are skin
firming and skin conditioning studies
that have been done on soybean oil so
the ingredients look pretty legit my big
complain about this it's not really a
complaint it's more of a inconvenience
there's like a ball of this caviar stuff
it looks really cool it's like black
sand in here in the middle of a bunch of
the oil and every time you go to use it
you have to stir it it doesn't stay
stirred kind of like you know natural
peanut butter how once you stir it it
pretty much stays stirred this one you
have to stir it every single time so you
want to either keep some kind of
stirring device in your bathroom or just
stir it with your finger like I'm doing
so this is kind of this is what it looks
like hopefully you can see that and it's
just this gritty and it looks like
caviar it's so cool-looking the scent of
it is very I would say unisex in that it
doesn't smell too masculine or too
feminine as far as my traditional
understandings of masculine and feminine
sense I would say if anything it smells
a little bit nutty with a little bit of
sweetness thrown in but mostly kind of a
nutty woodsy kind of set but not
patchouli II cuz I'm not a big fan of
patchouli so I did enjoy the scent very
much and I enjoy the experience of using
it and when I got out of the shower and
I felt my skin I was like my skin feels
nice my skin just felt really soft and I
don't usually put things on in the
shower like that or after the shower I'm
not a big moisturizing after the shower
kind of person so
was an unusual experience for me and I
really enjoyed it I feel like the price
point is a little high for something
that I would personally purchase because
they don't feel like it's something that
I need it's more of a luxury product for
me so I don't think I would purchase it
afterward but I'm really excited to have
it because it really was a fun
experience enjoying the scent and the
ingredients and the way my skin felt and
everything big thumbs up by the way just
a tiny bit about the aromatherapy
de-stress muscle gel there's a lot of
fragrance ingredients in there including
lavender oil there's some mixed research
on lavender oil specifically about it
being skin sensitizing some people are
very against that some people say that
those studies that's not what those
studies meant so you just kind of have
to decide for yourself but that is not
something that I would have chosen I
would definitely choose the scrub that's
me so now here are the products that
everybody gets no matter what this one I
freaked out when I saw it I was so
excited this is the new foreo fofo this
is the way that it comes in the box
again saving this for giveaway for the
fall you're supposed to hold it on your
skin and then it communicates with the
app and it tells you your skin's age
based on your hydration levels of your
skin they were measured by these little
dots which sounds so cool and then you
push the button and I'll let you hear it
if you've ever never sent a for you
before that's the vibrating business and
it's supposed to help you to cleanse and
exfoliate physically exfoliate your skin
so what you do is you and I have used it
what you do is you pop your cleanser on
here and then you rub it on your face if
you have an electric toothbrush that
tells you when to move it to a different
side of your mouth it's the same concept
so you rub it here until it goes boop
boop and then you rub it on your
forehead boo-boo and you rub it on your
other cheek boob and then you're
supposed to rub it on your nose and chin
and then you're done and I think the
whole process is either one or two
minutes the big bummer onei on this is
that the app hasn't been available for
me to use and give the fabfitfun ladies
such a hard time I think she's mad at me
I was like seriously foreo is not gonna
let us use the app before we tell people
about this like what why why did they do
that that is such a missed opportunity
because I could have explained to you
how the app works and all of that
but hopefully I'll be able to use this
with the app at some point and be able
to report back on it maybe in a monthly
favourites or something but as of now
all I can use it for is the typical
foreo thing which is just the cleansing
I haven't been able to test the skin age
thing at all because it's just not
functional yet it's a brand new product
and because it isn't being sold on their
website yet it's the app isn't available
for you if you're watching this that was
a major major fail major fail I wouldn't
not happy with you next up coolest
sunscreen I have not used this yet so
I'm gonna go ahead and put it on and see
how it looks as far as leaving a white
cast and it looks like it's just lotion
II yeah and my daughter needs sunscreen
so I'm gonna go run this to her and I'll
be right back lyla sunscreen so it's
technically a sport SPF white tea
moisturizer and again I looked up the
ingredients and there's actually some
really good ingredients in here the
scent doesn't smell like a strong
sunscreen it more smells like a fruity
floral so the first ingredient in here
is something called acacia extract
there's very little research in this and
it's used to assist the fragrance in the
product um now I guess is probably to
try to mask the sunscreen scent then
amaranthus seed extract also called wait
for this the nickname for this is the
love lies bleeding expert I couldn't
find a lot of information on this one
either but it's supposedly it's very
popular in Europe for anti-aging and for
dry skin the next ingredient is one that
I love to see in skincare and it's green
tea it does say white tea moisturizer
but Camilla census leaf extract is green
tea I guess it you know semantics green
tea as you might know drinking green tea
is amazing for your body it has anti
carcinogenic effects there is less
research for topical application than
drinking it but there is some good
research on topical application in that
it is
is an antioxidant for the skin so
because of that they think it probably
will help with the signs of aging but it
also may have anti-carcinogenic
properties for the skin as well so if
you're concerned about skin cancer or if
you do have skin cancer this may be
something you want to talk to your
doctor about look more into I personally
think that it is a fantastic skin
ingredient based on my research and I
love to see this in skin care products
so based on those top ingredients alone
this seems like it's gonna be a great
product I haven't tried it out in the
Sun to see whether it actually works as
a sunscreen it is an SPF 50 so I would
imagine that it does but it really felt
feels very nice on the skin it doesn't
fear it will feel overly oily or greasy
it might feel greasy on my face than it
does on my hand I can still feel that
slip a little bit but it's not bad at
all the only thing is there is a very
strong fragrance to it so keep that in
mind but I really like that product so
far and the last product I did get two
of these so if anybody wants it and give
away I'll might give this one away I
might give it to my mom it's this cute
little pure one dish and it's just to
put little things on top of I don't
really have use for something like this
something like this is clutter around my
house because I'm not organized enough
to have something that has a place in
something like this so I'll probably
give this away as a gift or something an
add-on gift or I don't know I don't
really have used for something like this
but you may have something used for it
and you may think it's super cute I do
think it's cute I just don't I don't use
stuff like this so now the big question
is is this worth the 50 or $40 for the
box and for me absolutely I think the
Tarte product alone is definitely going
to give it a lot of value because they
both like know the the cons the contour
highlight palette is really good the
eyeshadow palette and the liner seemed
to be good as well so that would make it
almost worth the whole box for me just
that that she has to try the foreo and
give it a chance I think is a huge win
for me the beach towels I love really
excited to have the Vasanti in my life
again really love that scrub oh my gosh
I'm very excited to have the coolest
sunscreen after looking up the
ingredients makes me super excited about
it the enzyme peel I could probably do
with or without but I am thankful to
have it and
the dish is really the only thing that
I'm kind of like meh everything else
there was at least a choice that I was
excited about this box is probably my
favorite fabfitfun box of all time and
I'm if you've watched my previous
fabfitfun unboxings you know I don't say
that ever so yeah I'm really excited
about the summer box and if you're
excited about it too definitely make
sure you jump on it now I don't know if
this is a marketing thing or not but
they told me that this one is selling
out faster than typical ones so if you
want to get one jump on it but I'm just
saying I have not seen the evidence that
it's selling out faster but you can
trust that information or not but
they've told me that it is selling out
faster than typical so keep that in mind
and if you do get the fabfitfun box what
do you think of it or if you don't get
it are you interested in it what are you
thinking about these products have you
used any of them what are your thoughts
