that I know a lot of people that grew up
in the 80s and probably 70s and maybe
90s watched when they were kids and then
you realize as you get older what
greased lightning is really about so
when I heard that isola look was that
coming out with a greased even pellet I
was so so excited if you want to see
what this greased pellet is all about
we're gonna slice open this packaging
together and and let's find out whether
it's worth your purchase or not hang
tight we're getting into it right now I
always wondered if sandy and Danny
actually ended up like getting married
and staying together I would imagine on
the premise that you know she he only
really liked her when she changed who
she was I would doubt that that
relationship would last but that's just
my speculation I could go on with grease
stories all day long but that's not what
this video is about this video is about
this eyeshadow palette so this says who
me yeah you so low look and it says
we're mega excited for you to try it our
product and it talks about the release
date get a really cool Rizzo sticker in
here that says okay girls let's go get
him I love this this like makes my
nostalgic heart just go oh I love it
pitter patter pitter patter I love it
you know maybe she feels a little sad
for the way that she's judged but she
never compromises who she is and I love
that about Rizzo I'm really happy that
they decided to put her on the sticker
because she's pretty awesome alright so
here is the Pink Ladies palette oh my
gosh this is going to be a first
impression review because as you may
know I am leaving for a long summer trip
so all I can do for this week and next
week is do first impressions for you or
else it just won't happen at all so let
me just give you some quick information
about this palette and the brand the
palette is going to be $40 it is made in
the PRC
and it is distributed in Massachusetts
of the United States this is in
collaboration with Paramount so this is
an officially licensed product it is a
cruelty free product
and it does say that they are FDA
compliant it's paraben free a gluten
free and there is some confusion about
whether something can be made in the
People's Republic of China and be
cruelty free yes it can the only way
that products are not cruelty free as
far as China is concerned is if they're
being sold to Chinese consumers the
Chinese government doesn't care about
exports they only care about their
Chinese consumers so if this product
were to be sold in Chinese stores it
would have to be tested on animals but
since it's directly exported it does not
need to be tested on animals that's
something that is very commonly
misunderstood one thing that is really
cool about this palette and I do want to
let you know I'm still going to be very
honest about this palette but if you
flip it over to the back it's a soul
look would like to thank the following
people for making this palette possible
and they actually put Jen Lowe's reviews
on the back here which was really really
nice of them we talked about them all
the time in the makeup news show and
I've been in contact back and forth with
the owner of solar look for a really
long time but that does not mean we are
giving them a break though we are still
going to definitely talk about the pros
and cons of this palette either way and
the owners a solo look know that so
let's go ahead and open this baby up
you've got the Pink Ladies eyeshadow
palette and you've got this a beautiful
picture and then on the back you have
all their names Frenchy Rizzo Jan and
Marty and there they are I'm kind of sad
Sandy's not on here I mean I guess there
are kind of the real pink ladies and
Sandy kind of joined them so if it's
pink ladies probably sandy really
shouldn't be on here for talking about
really and truly now we open this up and
we've got a picture of Rizzo here and
she's singing there are worse things I
could do and I love that song I love
that song and then we peel this off and
we have a mirror here and it lets see
nope not a wonky mirror and that's
really good
and we've got 10 shades here 140 Kai
already have already is that they are
all shimmer shades I wish that they had
included some mess in here that makes me
a little bit sad but we're gonna try to
work with it anyway another critique I
see right away is that I wish that there
was a true pink like this like their
jackets I wish they had like actually
matched up the pink from the jackets and
made
shade that color I can also would have
loved to have seen a cha-cha red that
would have been amazing because I love
to cha-cha back in the day but overall I
do like the color scheme of it this
electrifying color is really cool I
don't think I own anything quite like
that just from glancing at it and I
think that I'm gonna be able to create
some really neat looks with this I'm
just gonna need some matte shadows to
kind of anchor it down I don't
personally like to create looks with
just shimmers so now I have to decide
what colors I'm gonna play with mm maybe
we'll do like a peachy lid with like a
blue pop on the lower lash line we'll
play with it well see it will do but
overall this is my favorite design from
solo look that they've come out with I'm
gonna go ahead and put a picture of the
dirty dancing palette there I was not a
fan of a color design there the liquid
lipstick in there oh it was amazing
though just so you know and then here is
the Flashdance palette love the colors
in there but wish that the pan sizes
were smaller and that they included more
shades in the Flashdance palette for the
quality of the Flashdance palette was
amazing it was so good my next video
that I'm gonna be filming is the life's
to drag first impression so I'm gonna be
setting it up with the matte shades from
here but I'm not gonna use any of the
colors from this palette I'm just gonna
use the matte so let's go ahead and zoom
in and we'll get started on the demo
we made our way to the shoreline
we got away from the worst okay don't
you know
I'm never gonna give up
okay so I made an executive decision to
take that I look off and start over I
I am absolutely heartbroken right now
because I love the people over at Sola
look and my name is on the back of the
palette like it's breaking my heart that
these shadows are not working well for
me that when I try to put them onto the
lid they don't adhere to the lid there
they're not sticking to the lid and I
don't know what I'm gonna do I think I'm
gonna do is let's start again and let's
try to use a glitter glue and see if
that helps the shadows to adhere to the
lid to see if we can work with this so
I'm gonna do my best to try to make this
work and it takes an extra step of
glitter glue and that's not a
deal-breaker for you then maybe that'll
help maybe there's too much silica in
here that's there's really really really
soft so that's what I'm thinking is
there's just too much silica but we're
gonna try it again I'm gonna set down
the same base with mani shades from the
lifes to drive palette and then we'll go
in again with some glitter glue and
let's let's try it again
well that did not go as expected and
even though I'm a huge fan of the people
over at Sola look these are reviews
unfiltered and even if I love a brand it
doesn't mean that I'm going to love
every product that they put out and the
eye I'm really really sad that it didn't
work out without the glitter glue but it
seems to be working with the glitter
glue but the true test is going to be
whether this lasts throughout the day
with the glitter glue because maybe
that's not a deal breaker for you that
you need a glitter glue with it for it
to adhere to the eye but it was much
harder to work with than any other solo
look palette I've ever worked with
before and I don't know I don't know
what's going on there
I just realized there were some things I
did not mention about the palette it is
a cardboard packaging with a magnetic
closure and also I didn't mention that
it's got these cute little owls embossed
in each of the shadows that I think is
adorable and then with ingredients just
very quickly it is mica and talc base
the third ingredient is bismuth
oxychloride so if you're sensitive to
that ingredient you definitely do not
want to purchase this there is
dimethicone in this as well as a
phenoxyethanol as the preservative there
are two pigments in here that are not
ellipse safe but all of these are FDA
approved for I use and then there is
carmine in here so if you are not a fan
of using carmine then you definitely
don't want to use this if you're vegan
things like that it's currently 319 in
the afternoon so we'll be back after the
day and we're gonna see how this wears
oh I forgot to mention I did use the one
shade on as a highlight I use this shade
too pure as a highlight to see how that
works and I think it looked really looks
really pretty as a highlight I hope it
stays on I don't have any foundation on
so it's really just hanging out on its
own so I don't have high hopes for it
hanging in as a highlighter but we shall
see before we come back I will show you
some swatches just to show you how they
do swatch on the arm and yeah we'll be
back at the end of the evening see them
alright ladies and gentlemen are you
ready for swatches of the silver look
pink ladies palette I do really love the
names of this path by the way we're
gonna go ahead and start with a blonde
pineapple so pink peachy keen and beauty
school
and as you can see they finger swatch
pretty well the lighter ones are similar
to my skin tone so they're not going to
show up as much on me as they may show
up on someone of a deeper at skin tone
and you can see they brush swatch okay
I think peachy-keen breasts watches the
worst and you saw in the demo that that
was a shade that I really had trouble
building up and keeping looking good I
do see a little bit of repetition in the
shades blonde pineapple in beauty school
they are different and that blonde
pineapple definitely does have more of a
yellow undertone to it where Beauty
school is a little bit more Brown but
they're so close I wish that they had
done a different shade instead of one or
the other and if you are new to my
channel you are new to the wipe test and
the purpose of this is to show how the
shadows stain the skin and this really
is an indication of lasting power and as
you can see they do all wipe away except
for you can still see just a little bit
of beauty school left over it's not a
good sign
jelly bean - pure summer lovin and
electrifying our next electrifying I was
really excited about and then when I put
jelly bean on my lower lash line it was
like yes really really excited about
those two shades in particular I did
bring that electrifying down one more
time just the kind of blend it downward
you can see jelly bean it definitely
isn't as pigmented when swatched on so
that one may be better packed on to the
skin with a fingertip these light shades
really aren't super bright in the
swatches I do find them to be a little
bit brighter on the eye when they're
packed on but it really definitely could
be brighter in my opinion and then
electrifyin is again just a little less
pigmented in the brush swatch
and then getting into the white test I
do know that we don't wipe our eyes like
this throughout the day but I've found
that it really is quite true to lasting
power and this is over no primer it's
just straight onto my arm it's a jelly
bean and Electrify are the only ones
left finally we have heartbreak and
frosty palace these two are probably my
favorite shades just watching them I
haven't tried heartbreak on the eyes yet
but the swatches and their colors are
really really beautiful
frosty palace really does brush swatch
beautifully that's probably the
strongest shade in the palette I just
love the shine on that one as well
heartbreak does leave a little to be
desired in the brush swatch huh so again
this one is probably gonna be one you
want to tap on with your fingertip and
then as we wipe them away we can see
that frosty palace really does stay in
the skin pretty well so if the swatches
are any indication that's definitely
gonna be the strongest shade in the
palette as far as lasting power look at
me I'm Sandra Dee you know that song I
actually thought when they were like my
voice is cracking I'm tired and I'm
still sick with that song I honestly
thought I thought she just didn't want
to sleep until she was married like
honestly that's what I thought I would
love to know any other misconceptions
that you had about that movie when you
were younger like what did you think it
meant and then what did you find out
later on that it really meant I'm just
super curious alright let's check on
this I look I looked at a little while
ago and I was actually pleasantly
surprised because you all know I fought
with this in the beginning let me zoom
you in alright so let's look at the eyes
and as you can see I do have some
transfer of the glitter up onto the brow
bone I've been having that problem with
so many shadows lately and I'm honestly
thinking that part of it might be the
glitter glue itself that it's
transferring up because it's tacky and
when I open my eyes some of the
tackiness might be getting a little bit
onto my brow bone but if you've seen any
of my recent videos a Laura Lee palette
what was the other one that I did there
was another one or the kat von d palette
both of those did the exact same thing
so I'm thinking it might be a glitter
glue thing but just mental note that it
did transfer up on my brow bone but
overall I feel like this lasted really
really well also honorable mention on
the assist you the life's a drag palette
because those brown shades are
definitely still there as well I forgot
to tell you what time it is it is
currently 1141 I've my night shift on so
it's like all dark looking but it's 1141
so it's been a solid eight and a half
hours and I really do think it looks
good let me go ahead and zoom you out I
apologize for the dark space over here
we'll fix the lighting one day one day
one Wednesday we'll get a light for this
side when the Sun isn't shining but
final thoughts on this I honestly think
the biggest market for this is going to
be people who want it for the nostalgia
factor personally I know I am in that
category for a nostalgia for Greece I
just it's got a special place in my
heart so I would probably purchase this
for that part of it and knowing that
there is a way to work with it there is
a way to get these shadows here to work
it just takes that glitter glue and if
that's a deal-breaker for you like I
totally get that and I think with most
palettes that would be a deal-breaker
for me but for this one it's not a deal
breaker and and it really does have to
do with the nostalgia it also has to do
with my personal you know feelings about
solo look in general and then I just
really love the brand I love the people
that work there so that also would make
me personally purchase now if I stripped
away the grease and I stripped away the
brands I probably wouldn't purchase this
palette and the reason why is just
because of that I knew I needed to use
that glitter glue and for $40 I feel
like that's kind of crazy like to have
to use the glitter glue but I mean I
definitely think there's a market for
this palette I think it's a lot of fun I
love the colors that are in here it's
just that blending killed me man
absolutely killed me and I did talk to
the people over at solo look at I did
let them know and I was like dude like
this is this it's breaking my heart and
they did say that they did send this to
a couple of other influences I think
they're on Instagram
No and they did say that those people
did not have the same issues that I had
but I'm not gonna omit it I'm not gonna
leave it out I'm gonna show you this is
reviews unfiltered so I'm not filtering
anything out I'm gonna break it down to
you that I did have significant double
culty with these shades here on my lid I
do want to thank solo look for setting
this to me I hope you know that I love
you dearly and I appreciate you and I
appreciate that you took a chance and
sent this to me it means a lot to me and
thank you of course so much for watching
