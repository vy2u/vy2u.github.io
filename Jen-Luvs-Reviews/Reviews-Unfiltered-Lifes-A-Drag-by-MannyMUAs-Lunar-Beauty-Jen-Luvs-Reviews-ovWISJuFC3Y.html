highly requested videos that I have ever
filmed I've had a few requested about as
much as this but this was definitely a
big one this is Manny mu A's lunar
Beauty life's to drag palettes Manny's
audience is huge and I think because he
has such a wide exposure people have
very strong opinions about how they feel
about him and therefore even without
trying the palette kind of having an
opinion about whether they want to
purchase it based on what they know
about Manny now for me personally I'm
gonna try to strip away all of that and
we're just gonna talk about the product
as is pretending like everything is
stripped away from it except for the
shadows and the shadow quality we're
gonna do a ware test we're gonna do
swatches we're gonna do some comparisons
with other pilots and if that sounds
good to you hang tight we're getting
into it right now without Gavin on let's
just go ahead and talk about this
palette we're gonna start with brand
details so this is the first launch of a
lunar beauty it is $45 but with shipping
for me it was fifty one dollars and
fifty cents this brand is cruelty free
and made in the US now as far as the
vegan thing if you look at the
ingredient list all of the ingredients
seem to be vegan mani did mention in his
video that he did not because of time I
believe he said I'd get this as
certified vegan so he could not put it
on the packaging what my thought is is
he probably didn't realize that he had
to go through a process in order to get
it to be certified vegan and that's
probably why it doesn't say it I do want
to quickly read the return policy in
case you're curious returns will be
accepted only for items damaged during
transit so if you don't like it then you
cannot return it only if it is damaged
may you return it if you happen to
receive a damaged pallet we will gladly
accept your return if received within 30
days from the original purchase date
returned must be received it back to the
address listed below in the original
packaging and must contain photos of the
issue what it says must contain photos
of the issue and include the packing
slip I'm not quite sure what photos of
the issue means I don't know maybe like
a screen capture of your purchase order
or something I don't know I'm a little
confused by that but
put any clarifying information down
below I'll DM Manny and see if I could
get information on that because I just
reread that now I'm confused in their
FAQ there's another interesting thing
here it says well lunar beauty be
available at any other retailers yes we
will soon be announcing our partnership
with US and overseas retailers stay
tuned and then also about international
customs and duty charges duty fees
customs taxes are not covered by lunar
beauty you do have to pay those if you
purchase this outside of the US now
let's go ahead and talk about what you
get in this palette so as you can see it
is a very thick I'm gonna show you some
other palettes kind of show you the size
this is dominique cosmetics a lot a
palette I'm gonna show you the thickness
there and then this is Laura Lee's cat's
pajamas next to it this is the bonbon
palette by Too Faced kind of see what
that looks like and then the Urban Decay
Naked palette as far as the the size of
the palette so you can see this one is
very very large I also wanted of course
to compare it to his friend Laura Lee's
nudie patootie palette Laura Lee's is
just a slight bit longer but Manny's is
thicker now let's look at the inside and
look at the pan sizes they look like
they are the same size as Laura's pants
okay definitely bigger than the Too
Faced bonbons pants here is next to the
Urban Decay Naked palette the original
definitely larger than those I think
these are about a gram each and they are
definitely significantly smaller in
diameter than the kristen dominique
palette they are 1 and 1/2 gram pans so
that leads us to two dollars and
fourteen cents per gram if you're
planning on hitting pan and going
through this palette that's actually a
less expensive than most Sephora brands
as far as price per gram but then when
we go to per pan it's three dollars and
21 cents per pan which is also on the
less expensive side so the reason why it
seems this palette is so thick is
because there is a brush included I have
been using this brush with this palette
and with other palettes and I will tell
you that I do like it I don't love it
but I do think that it does have its
function my complaint about my complaint
but just my personal preference with the
fluffier side of the brush is that I
wish that the tapers went down just a
little bit further I
like a more pointed blending brush I
think that would have been my personal
choice the other side the color packing
side actually really like it's not
really large which is good for people
with smaller eyes and people that want
to get more detail and also it's got a
lot of bristles so it does pick up quite
a bit of project product so I do like it
and it's not scratchy at all I love that
it says lunar Beauty on it I know this
must have cost him some money so you're
definitely getting a decent brush in
here is it the best brush I've ever used
no but it is good I also noticed that
the Farrell's are not Wiggly on here
which is nice which is an indication of
a better quality brush as far as
traveling it is quite a large thick
pallet so I don't know if this is
something you would want to travel with
the men it is pretty strong like I have
to pull on it pretty good to get it to
open but I would definitely pack this in
something else just to make sure it
doesn't open by getting flicked open
also just about the mirror I'm
personally not a fan of an obstructed
mirror I personally prefer it to be
bigger because I have trouble seeing
what's happening there I mean I can see
my eyes but I'm having trouble seeing
the rest of my face in this mirror and
he's got so much space up here I wish
that this had been stretched all the way
out I do think that it's pretty with the
whole filigree kind of thing and the BIA
Queen here I think it's very cute but I
don't think it's very functional my
personal opinion of the packaging is I'm
not a big fan of eyes on packaging just
personally I find them to be creepy like
this creeps me out I think that that's
just weird I know it's very popular it's
been in lots of different cosmetic
things and it's not my palette but this
is definitely not something that I would
choose I do think it's cool with the
hollow on there but it's just I don't
know I like this side this side is
really really pretty and sleek and I
kind of wish this was on the front and
this white just wrapped around the back
I don't know it's just it's just a
personal preference thing I also really
like the outer carton it's beautiful I
love the the raised and pulled with life
to drag with the crown and everything
it's this is super cute this side is
super cute this one just isn't my
personal taste but I can see why other
people would really love this it's just
not for me I don't know I just kind of
feel like the palettes looking into my
soul and it's it creeps me out a little
bit just a little bit about the
ingredients in this it is a mica and
talc based product there is dimethicone
in here the preservatives is
phenoxyethanol which some people are
sensitive to as far as pigments go there
are a few ingredient
in here there are not approved for the
lips I know some people like to tap
powder products on to their lips I would
not recommend that for this because it
does have chromium hydroxide greens also
ferric ferrocyanide I found out recently
that ultramarines is kind of iffy as far
as whether the FDA approves it for lips
use it's very weird the FDA is very odd
as far as pigments and what they approve
and what they don't approve I have a
whole video on that in relation to manis
palette if you want to watch that I'll
put that down below but I'll give you
the quick sum up of what was in that
video in an effort to be vegan and not
use carmine which is a red pigment made
from crushed bugs they like squeeze the
juice out of the bugs which is totally
gross but it's used in it's been used
for a long long long long long time as
far as cosmetic cosmetic purposes but he
didn't want to use that so he used some
red pigments including red 6/7 and red
28 those are not FDA approved for I use
but they are approved in the European
Union by Co Singh so I personally I like
I've mentioned the end of that video I
feel like there are going to be some
people that are going to have allergic
reactions to this for use on the eyes
that red pigment but there are a lot of
things that cause allergic reaction that
are FDA approved for the eyes like
bismuth oxychloride phenoxyethanol
things like that talc you just have to
decide what is best for you personally
and because they are approved in the
European Union and they are so much
better at this stuff than we are I
personally don't have a problem using
these pigments on my eyes it's something
that an opinion that I'd changed based
on the research that I did for that
video again it'll be linked below if you
want to watch the whole thing but I
personally I've used all of these shades
on my eyes I haven't had any kind of
allergic reaction in that video I talked
about I probably wouldn't use it on the
lower lash line I broke that and one of
my tests and I decided to use on the
lower lash line I had no problems with
it will it be something I choose to do
all the time probably not but I had just
so you know I had no problem with it
on the lower lash line anywhere on my
eyes I don't have any problems but I do
know that some of my subscribers cannot
use those red pigments on their eyes so
I definitely want to make sure you know
that that's in here so you are aware so
you do not purchase it if you know that
you are sensitive so now that we've done
all the details let's go ahead and
in to the demo again I am NOT a makeup
artist I am a makeup enthusiast I'm
having fun here so let's go ahead and
have some fun with this crazy
don't lose my patience
don't keep you waiting noise
my change
like super feel like I know no I don't
know
all right I might deserve to shoot that
you don't really do many things but
you're just looking for reason
my patients don't keep you waiting no
this is definitely not my favorite I
look I've ever created and it's because
I'm rushing it's actually 2:16 and I let
me show you 2:16 I was supposed to pick
up my daughter from her friend's house
at 2:15 he just lives right down the
street but I was supposed to pick her up
because we're headed over my mom's house
and I really want to get you this video
so we're gonna be speaking on not just
today's application but on the
application of the last few days I'm
gonna go ahead and put the look up that
I really really like that I did I know
it's still not professional because I'm
not a professional but this was my
favorite I look that I created I'm being
defensive right now because I know this
I look did not come out as good as I
hoped just because I was rushing but
anyway without me giving any more
excuses we're still gonna do a wear test
today I'll give you as much information
as I possibly can now I just want to
mention as far as my use of beat all
over the one lid that I had to remove
and put back on this is very peachy in
the swatch but on my lid it actually
comes out more champagne when I use it
by itself and I've used a jus vyas place
eye shadows before where I've popped
them over matte colorful shades and it
looks absolutely gorgeous it completely
failed with this so now I just know that
I can't do that but that's not work well
with these shadows because that look
ruin or really bad so that was just more
of a trial and error moment these are
reviews unfiltered I wanted to show you
just so you know how that looks if you
try it doesn't work well all right I got
a stopgap and I gotta go pick up my kid
I will see you all at the end of the day
after the cookout while you're waiting
for me to go to the cookout and all of
that we're gonna do swatches and some
comparisons and stuff because I think
that would be really really interesting
so go ahead and watch those and then
we'll be back for the wear test all
right ladies and gentlemen we have the
life's a drag pallets first we're gonna
show you the more natural shades these
are finger swatches and brush swatches
the finger swatch is going to be on the
left followed by its accompanying brush
swatch and as you can see they
definitely finger swatch more pigmented
than they do brush swatch I find it to
be a lot easier when shadows build up
rather than when they go on super
pigmented
now if you
new to my channel you are new to the
wipe test and the purpose of this is to
show the staining on the skin and I have
found this and people who watch my
videos have found this to be quite
accurate to lasting power so when we
look at these wipes away we can still
see the lighter shade but we definitely
definitely definitely have those deeper
shades hanging on there which is a
really great sign that the deeper shades
are going to have great lasting power
moving on to the two shimmer shades I
actually really don't like the shimmer
formula in this I find it to be kind of
messy to work with and also messy
through the day I did a look with both
of these shadows all over my lid and I
found they mushed together through the
day it was just kind of a glittery mess
all over my lid without much color
separation by the end of the day they're
beautiful in a swatch but as far as the
performance they're just not my favorite
and as you can see when you wipe them
away the undertone is pretty much
exactly the same and that was the
problem I was having with these lasting
throughout the day there was however
Sparkle on my lid throughout the day it
was just kind of flopped messy all over
up on my brow bone and everywhere not
under my eye but definitely all over my
entire upper lid space now let's go
ahead and move on to the brighter shades
again we've got that same thing with the
mattes where they are much brighter with
that finger swatch on the left then the
brush swatch on the right and I am not
hating on that I find that to be much
easier to work with now the one shade
that man even mentioned that is a little
bit weaker is Kiki and I have found that
to be the same on the lid it just
doesn't have that punch and when we get
to the dupe shades I'll show you one
that I like a lot better than Kiki I
just wish that it was just a little bit
more comfy but the rest of them I really
really like a lot now we're gonna go
ahead and talk about the dupe and semi
dupe shades that I found in my
collection some of these are going to be
closer than others some of them I just
included because I thought that you
would find them interesting if I did
include them I don't find this in the
swatch to really come through as a true
white the balms nude tude sassy comes
off more white on my skin it's got oh
the tiny tiny hint of peach underneath
it this is definitely not my favorite
white shade that I've ever used it's
nice it's fine but it's definitely could
have a little bit of improvement there
as far as how bright the white is there
are tons of duplex shades for sickening
I feel like those last two really aren't
great dupes for this but I want to
include them anyway because I found
interesting that they were somewhat
close I actually think that the a BH
mono Renaissance burnt-orange is really
really close on this one also very
surprised about that L'Oreal paradise
enchanted number 8 shade and of course
Jacqueline Hills butter wiping them away
you'll notice they all have very good
lasting power the ones that were a
little bit brighter definitely seem to
have more lasting power but I'm
definitely not concerned about any of
these shades lasting a long time on the
eye now let's talk about hunty I
actually found that the Laura Lee nudie
patooty reveal shade was really really
close to this it's got a very similar
undertone the other ones here are just a
little bit grayer but they are all
pretty similar
moving on to Shady which is lunar
beauty's black shade of course a lot of
brands make black so I just picked a
handful of them for you to see they're
all quite similar as far as how they
look they're all true blacks the lunar
Beauty one actually looks really creamy
compared to all of these I know mani
said that it wasn't really a super
pigmented black but in this swatch it
really is a pretty pigmented black
wiping them away you'll notice that the
lunar Beauty one really is still very
much there especially compared to some
of the other ones that are there it's a
very very nice black I really like it a
lot now trade I thought I would have an
easier time duping that I did and I
really couldn't find a dupe for trade I
was shocked that I couldn't find a dupe
for it because it's got this like maroon
undertone to it I thought I'd be able to
find something in the a BH modern
Renaissance
nothing really quite matched it was
either a little bit too light a little
bit too dark or a little too Brown so
these are the closest ones that I had
and wiping them away the lunar Beauty
one definitely has the most
staining power out of all of the ones
that I have that are close now mug is a
very doable shade you'll be able to find
this most likely and a pellet that you
own somewhere it's just a warm brown
it's a beautiful shade it's a very
useful shade and I think that's why a
lot of pilots use it but it's definitely
not unique now when we do the white test
you'll notice that the lunar Beauty one
does hang out there really really well
in comparison with some of the other
ones it's definitely a really nice shade
B is a frosty peachy pink and it is
really pretty in a swatch but I cannot
get this one to look peachy pink on my
eye for some reason on my eye it looks
more champagne looking I don't know but
in the white test you see that it does
hang off there pretty well even the
shimmer is still there and that's what I
noticed on the eye as well that the
shimmer does hang on it just seems too
muddy into the other shades for me with
legendary I actually didn't have a
yellow gold as yellow as the one from
lunar Beauty I had one that was a little
bit brighter of a yellow but it was much
lighter so I didn't include that one but
these are the closest dupes that I could
find for legendary and wiping them away
you'll notice that legendary really
doesn't hang in there very well at all
now for campy I want to have a little
fun I knew I didn't have very many
yellow so I threw in some of these
shimmery yellows just for fun just so
you could see the color comparison with
some other palettes you'll notice that
can't be swatched actually is a little
bit more mustard and a little less
bright than some of the other yellows
which was a little surprising to me but
when we wipe it away it really does
stain really really well and I was very
impressed with the lasting power on
campy when I used it on the eyes
pendulum was another one it was really
difficult for me to dupe that's why I
included that one really shimmery shade
just to show it next one just to shake
what it looked like purples are really
difficult to do without some kind of
gray undertone and this one is
definitely beautiful and you can see it
in the white test that there is no gray
tone undertone it does stay like this
beautiful pinky purple
Kikki again like Manny said it really
doesn't swatch well I really don't feel
like it performs great on the eye either
and you can see the shade next to it
which is the supa Beauty one that is
more what I was looking for from Kiki
and it just doesn't perform that great
yes you can use it as a transition color
but now I want to I want to be able to
have that choice of on the lid or a
transition and you can see that it
doesn't hang out well in the white test
either Manny pronounces this next one
Chi Chi so I'm gonna pronounce it the
same way as you can see how all that
trouble duping this one as well but the
closest dupe again was from Suva Beauty
it's just this really vibrant blue-based
pink and it's really really a beautiful
shade and through the white test it
hangs out there really really well it
definitely kicks the Suva Beauty ones
but I'll tell you that
snatched is one that really surprised me
because in the pan it is a deep burgundy
red but on the eyes it actually is more
of a deep deep pink which really
surprised me so I had a lot of trouble
duping this one as well the other ones
you see her are definitely more red to
brown but yeah really hard to dupe
really unique shade but it definitely
doesn't look the same in the pan as it
does on the eye or in the swatch and
white being away you can see the last
color on this is most likely gonna be
really really good the result for me
when I use it on my eyes was fantastic
and it's a really great shade it just
looks really different in the pan fishy
is probably my favorite shade in this
palette I just love the bright blue it
makes me so happy it brings joy to my
art it's not shimmery it's not matte
it's just somewhere in between so I've
got some different examples of ones that
are similar I feel like the shade is
spot-on on these but just the level of
shine is just a little bit different Jiu
vias place Dahlia is my favorite blue
shade of all time so it definitely
doesn't hold a candle to Dahlia Dahlia
is ridiculous but it gets kind of close
sort of kind of next what I decided to
do was if there was a palette that there
were more than four dupes in the palette
I wanted to show you them next to each
other so on the top row here we have the
aloo
Beauty palette on the bottom row is
going to be the other palette so in this
case it's nudie patootie by Laura Lee
and you can see that they are quite
similar but they're definitely not the
same the white in Laura's palette is a
little bit shimmery er and the gold is a
little bit deeper moving on to the
modern renaissance palette by Anastasia
Beverly Hills you can see these are
pretty close dupes as well at least
until we get to that last one it's
really not a dupe but I did show it in
the swatches earlier so I wanted to show
it now and just give you that visual
comparison so you can know what you're
dealing with here
next up the jacqueline hell morphe
palette I was surprised there weren't
more dupes in here than there actually
are there really are very few I do think
the first four are pretty close but that
gold is definitely different it's deeper
in the Jacqueline Hill palette I do like
the Jacqueline Hill pool party much
better than I like Kiki it's got more
shine to it it's got more impact it's
just an all around better shadow but
other than that I feel like they're very
comparable this is another one the jus
vias place master a palette that I
thought there would be a lot more dupes
than there were jus vyas place is one of
my favorite brands and I do think I do
like Julia's place shadow is just a
little bit more than the lunar Beauty
ones but you aren't going to be able to
get all of the life's to drag shade in
any of the Julia's Place palettes
altogether you're gonna have to mix and
match to get all of those shades
next up the supa Beauty one lots and
lots of dupes in this palette I was
actually surprised that there were so
many dudes in this tile I knew there
will be some but we've got a lot of
Dukes and they're very very close the
Suva Beauty ones I find to be just a tad
bit brighter but the lasting power isn't
as good on the Suva Beauty ones overall
than the lunar Beauty ones except for
Kiki Kiki's the only one where I feel
like super beauty the lasting power is
better than lunar Beauty and finally for
fun we threw in the Kat Von D maybe
it'll loca palette which is a classic a
bright colored palette just the four
shades there that are similar really
just the three - the pink are probably
would be considered dupes but I did want
to show you the
Pink's next to each other as well just
so that you could see I hope you found
all of these swatches helpful and now on
to the wear test results and my full
review oh my gosh I looked at this I
look I hate this I look I think this is
my least favorite I look I've ever done
on camera at least in a really really
long time so I apologize the look sucks
but that's that's what we got to go with
tomorrow's my husband's birthday and I
can't refilm tomorrow because I want to
spend time with my husband on his
birthday so we're just gonna have to go
with it as is I promise you if I wasn't
going away on Sunday then I would I
would refill this but I just can't so
let's go ahead and zoom in and I'm still
gonna give you final thoughts on this
even though I hate this outlook so there
is how it looks now
there's definitely muddying up in the
crease between the purple and the Browns
but I honestly think that was operator
error
the other times I've used this palette I
have not had that problem but also the
colors were quite different from one
another so it's kind of a question mark
maybe probably my fault
you can still see the brighter colors on
the lid they're still very vibrant but
they're not of course as vibrant as they
were nine hours ago by the way it is
after midnight it's about 12:30 I just
uploaded that elf primer video really
quickly you haven't seen that about the
elf primer scam it's just a little quick
fun extra video that I threw up but not
threw up but oh my gosh I'm getting
tired let me go ahead and zoom you out
for final thoughts so let me just tell
you what I think based on all of my uses
of this now the brush I think is good
it's probably one of the better brushes
that I've seen in a palette definitely
not my favorite brush of all the time
but it is functional you can use it it
is a decent brush the Matteson here are
awesome the mattes are super fast
I did use the black and a look yesterday
and it worked really well I don't think
this is the best white that I've ever
used even though he thinks is the best
quick he never he's ever used I've
definitely used whites that I like
better but it's still really good with
the standout stars are these shades over
here and then the brown shades here the
matte shades really having a lot of fun
with these and I find them to be very
easy to blend together
I like the colors all you need to do is
layer them over top of each other like
back and forth a little bit and they
just blend themselves
so they're really really good I'm not
personally a fan of the shimmers at all
I find them to be there they're very
sloppy you know they kind of go all over
the place all over the lid not a lot of
glitter fall out through the day but
they just kind of go all over the lid
through the day kind of fly around
everywhere and I'm just not a fan of the
shimmer formula at all but the mats are
super awesome so that makes me really
happy this is mostly a matte palette if
you have a large makeup collection you
probably have this side you may have
this side and I would say these aren't
worth buying it for in my opinion so if
you really kind of have to look at your
collection and decide whether you would
use it or not I feel like it was a huge
good idea for Manny to do something
different and they'd be scholarly
brights in here but at the same time
there's a reason why companies continue
to release neutral pellets everybody
complains everybody says it's the same
old neutral boring palette you know and
it was it was smart of him in that way
to release something that had something
different in it when as soon as I saw
this revealed I was like me that was
really smart because you can take these
neutrals and you just pull one of these
pops of color in but I think the pops of
color do scare some people and will
scare some people away from purchasing
this product so money making wise he
would have done better to release a more
boring palette I believe but as far as
trying to keep his audience happy
keeping YouTube viewers happy I think he
was smart to release a palette with more
colors I am very happy with this
purchase I am going to be using these
and I am going to continue to enjoy them
