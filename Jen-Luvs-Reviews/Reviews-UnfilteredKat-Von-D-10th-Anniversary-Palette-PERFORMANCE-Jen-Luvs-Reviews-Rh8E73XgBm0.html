to do with you Kat Von D ah I you doh
we're gonna see how this goes
I'm oh yeah hello my friends welcome to
one of the parts of my Kat Von D 10th
anniversary palette review by popular
request I am cutting down the length of
my review videos because not everybody's
got time for a forty minute video so we
are going to break up this kat von d
palette review into two sections this
section is going to be how does the
product perform it's gonna be all about
performance we're going to be doing two
looks with two we're tests as well as
swatches and the other video we're going
to go into the details about the product
all of the ingredients that I always do
and there will be the full review of
everything I think based on all of the
information will be in the other video
today we are going to do look number one
which is me trying to use my skills and
trying to figure out how I would use
this based on my current skill level and
then the second wear test is going to be
an inspired look by either something on
Instagram or something on YouTube and
I'm gonna try some new techniques out
and we can kind of play around and learn
together not just with the eyeshadow
palette but also with some more advanced
interesting makeup techniques I will
tell you that my experience so far with
this palette has not been very positive
I've had a lot of trouble working with
this palette I've had a lot of trouble
getting eyes shadows to blend the way I
want them to I don't know what is going
on with this palette I am usually a huge
cap on the eyeshadow fan and this
palette has just not been it has not
been making me happy so we're gonna try
it we're gonna keep trying it and that's
why I'm filming this one before the full
review because I want to make sure that
nothing changes during this process as
we're seeing this perform together I do
want to tell you that this palette is
$52 it's available at Sephora and also
at Kat Von D beauty.com it is vegan and
cruelty free so without further ado this
is Vee
we're doing this already but we're gonna
go ahead and zoom in and start with the
look oh my gosh let's get going
I can't pretend it
I can't pretend it don't go I don't feel
right
I
my
that I'm paranoid and full of jealousy
oh you're lying your behavior change
Oh
no you ain't gonna
and I'm holding
don't feel
and I've been down this road who's
leaving here before I'd be a fool
you ain't try and I don't want this
anymore
believe me I will be fine no I don't
need to buy a lens way too strong so if
I certainly Oh
see
I can't breathe
Oh
I can't pretend it don't feel right not
a damn pretend day I can't
I can't pretend
that was much more successful than I
expected that's officially the best that
I've ever gotten this to look I'm really
excited about this look I think fumble
the shades that I had played with before
had been mostly like the green shades
and the blue shades so for the second
look I'll try to find looks that use
more of this part over here rather than
the orange yellow side so we can try
some other colors in the palette just a
little bit about what's on the rest of
my face my blush today is tipsy by tarte
my highlight today is sin by urban decay
i use the tarte original clay play
palette to contour in the shade desert I
also used a little bit of the shade as a
lighter shade to kind of blend my
contour and lips today our Afra where
are you there you are Oprah's Solano is
on my lips today I felt like going a
little shimmery today with my lips so
right now it is currently 351 p.m. so
we'll be back at the end of the night
for a wear test to see how these wore
through the day mental note of the
glitter fallout on my face I definitely
needed to do my foundation and concealer
afterward because there was a lot of
glitter on my face from the palette but
it may have been due to me just not
tapping off my brush enough maybe a
glitter glue would have helped but the
foundation and concealer afterward has
done very well I see very little glitter
on my face now maybe a couple of specks
here and there but not bad at all so
yeah so we're gonna take about eight
hours and we'll be back to see how this
looks alright my friends it is 1207 in
the morning I was planning on coming
back about a half an hour ago but I was
finishing up editing something and now
I'm done but that's not why you're here
you're here to see how this eye shadow
lasted and my sleepy eyes are gonna show
you let me check it out first real quick
let's do this business whoa that
actually looks pretty good
very interesting let's zoom in so you
can see better all right so let's check
it out and see how things look I think
it looks pretty stinkin good I do have a
some glitter transfer going on up into
my crease maybe it's just the colors
that I use but I feel like
it doesn't look bad at all even
transferred into my crease I don't have
any glitter fallout on my cheeks that's
amazing because of this shadow this gold
shadow is really stinking chunky like
it's probably the chunky asjuan in the
palette this one right here what do you
think I think it looks really good let
me know me zoom you back out for final
thoughts for the day one thing I noticed
is the separation of color still looks
really good like you can definitely see
the difference between like the orange
II shades and yellowy shades both eye
primers performed equally the urban
decay and the covergirl that's why I put
on two different eye primers because I
want to see whether the palette works
better with one primer versus another so
I'm really curious to see what's gonna
happen tomorrow for a wear test number
two but before we get to wear test
number two I am gonna break this up with
some a little bit of swatching action so
if you're curious about swatches of this
palette we're gonna do finger and brush
swatches right now and when I see you
again it's gonna be tomorrow it's gonna
be a fresh new day it's a new dawn it's
a new day it's a new eyeshadow look
happening I'm sleepy I'm going to bed
good night see you tomorrow all right
here's the palette let's go over the
swatches just a little bit and I'll let
you know kind of if Eastwatch is a
representative of what we see on the eye
as you can see there is a mix of these
metallic shimmer shades and matte shades
I actually really like the shimmer
shades much better than I do the mattes
in this palette we're gonna start off
with Adele Malus Ashley and Gina you can
see Adele does not finger swatch very
well
malleus and Ashley and Gina are much
better adele is very difficult to work
with it does come out patchy even with a
blending brush the only way to really
use adele is to pack it on here's a
third swatch just to show you I mean
it's just very difficult to get it to
move where I wanted to move going in
with the brush swatches again you can
see that it does come out patchy with
the brush swatch and it's just difficult
to get rid of that patchiness Ashley is
just a little bit better than
Melisande Adele and Gina is pretty good
that one is probably one of my more
favorite shadows in this palette and
that's the first four altogether of
course this quad is a very very warm if
you're new to my channel you are new to
the white test the idea behind this is
we were looking to see if the shadows
are staining the skin and this gives a
hand to lasting power and I've noticed
that shadows that do stain the skin tend
to last longer on the eye this is not a
permanent staining or a long time
staining it's just a temporary standing
it removes very easily with makeup
remover moving on to the second set of
for Egypt Sylvia Lala and Lee far I'm
gonna pronounce it that way I'm not
quite sure if I said that right or not
Egypt is gorgeous it's definitely one of
my favorites
it doesn't brush swatch very well you
definitely need to pack this one on
Sylvia is quite close to my skin tone so
it's really hard to see but this one's
actually quite a beautiful sheet it
works very well la la I have so much
trouble with this is my least favorite
shade in the palette it is so difficult
to blend I've tried with that shade so
many times and it's really difficult but
I think a leaf leaf are it I hope is my
favorite shade in the palette it is
incredibly gorgeous but again it doesn't
swatch that well you do definitely need
to pack this one on and with the white
test even Sylvia is still there which is
incredible for a lighter shade Egypt
went away but I've noticed the lasting
power of Egypt on the eye is very good
and the third set of four is Melanie
Alexandra Nancy and Katherine squared
which I thought was a really interesting
name for a shadow
Catherine I did a second swatch of
because I really wanted you to be able
to see the shift in here it's absolutely
beautiful Melanie does brush watch
pretty well it's a typical cream shade
it works very well
alexandra has a really nice shift to it
too it's like this peachy pink shift
orangie goodness it's really nice Nancy
is a little bit tricky to work with it's
not my favorite shade Catherine is
gorgeous and fun but again needs to be
packed onto the lid there is no brushing
this anywhere this this needs to be
packed in seed packing definitely help
us build it up but a fingertip
definitely works best with this
and as we do the white test we can still
see Melanie which is insane the other
shades definitely are still there as
well and I love that with Katherine in
the finger swatch you can still see that
purple there as Purple's tend to really
turn gray when you look at the undertone
of them so it's nice that it's still
purple and for the final quad we have
Kelly Sarah Carolyn and Chad this is the
blue corner Kelly is really really fun
it's like a baby blue shifts brown it's
really neat Sarah I find to be very
difficult to work with and Carolyn is
very very similar to Lala in that it is
insanely difficult to blend without
patchiness it's one of those go big or
go home shades just like the rest of the
shimmers in this palette Kelly needs to
be packed on absolutely Sarah
fingers watched pretty well but it's
very difficult to work with and you can
kind of see that with the brush swatch
and again just Carolyn is just Pachi
Pachi Pachi Pachi Chad same thing I
don't know what is going on with these
mats in this palette but they're very
difficult to work with unless again you
are going to just pack them on hard once
you pack them on you can blend them but
I'm one that likes to start off light
and work my way up and it's just really
difficult to do that with this palette
and finally the last wipe test again
just the the pigmentation and the
staining of the skin is wonderful and
that just backs up the lasting power of
this palette and you can really see that
with the wipe test and that is very true
to real life hello my friends welcome
today to which is going to be the
challenge look I hope you enjoyed the
swatches I hope that you found them
helpful let's go ahead and get into day
two I chose a video for my inspo and the
video creators name is Bailey serÃ­an she
has about a hundred and twenty six
thousand subscribers on YouTube her
visuals are amazing she's sick talented
and I'd never seen her channel before I
just found her through YouTube searching
and found her and she came up with this
gorgeous eye shadow look which is
extremely out of my
comfort zone so I threw on a black tank
top and we're ready to go full dark
green glam with this look I'm gonna try
at least because it looks really hard by
the way I did want to let you know all
the brushes that I'm using are from a
brand called Stella Z I've been really
digging on these lately they did send me
a bunch of their brushes and I'm pretty
impressed so far I will link their
website down below in case you want to
check out their brushes but that's all I
used yesterday and that's all I'm gonna
use today as well I always get nervous
on challenge day but I'm just gonna stop
we're gonna do it we're gonna jump in
and we're going to test this right now
see there's only
maybe I'll keep on punching myself back
into their clothes on me
I need all
Robin
nobody's getting baby I was
baby because I need to know he
cousin
Oh
you
you
I know that you see it so tell me this
isn't true
you ain't so big I never do
so just watch anything come
if I
there's no
I feel like a leprechaun came and
punched me in the eye
well maybe liner and lashes will bring
it all together because right now this
is just I'm just not used to this I'm
just not used to this I think that I did
okay but I'm just not used to this let's
do the whole face thing because I want
you to think I'm magical so I'm gonna
put my hands over my face and then
magically I'm gonna flash as a liner on
see it's magic and I have a hair in my
face so give me that magic I don't know
I don't know about this lip either I
feel like I should have toned down the
lip a little bit I don't know it was
feeling a little funky because Bailey
she uses this like midnight like deep
red vampire real looking lipstick and I
couldn't bring it bad deem so I ended up
using the OCC lip tar in the shade
artifact on my lips I want to go full-on
Elphaba over here and I ended up using
from the Kat Von D Alchemist palette I
used the green emerald shade as my
highlight and I also did it to highlight
the brow bone just a little bit because
I thought that that would be fun and
today is play day this is when we just
kick back and try something new so let's
go ahead and zoom in on my eyes you can
see how it came out
biggest critique is that I found some of
the matte green shades very difficult to
build and blend right so it is currently
212 and we are going to come back in
about eight hours to check on this look
and see how it lasted I honestly don't
feel like this is going to be a good
test for the glitter glue because I
didn't put it all over the lid this
isn't a straight-up shimmery look and it
just it isn't gonna be valid it was
something I was trying it didn't work
out we might be able to get a little bit
of information but it's definitely not
an ideal way to test the glitter glue
just so you know on my cheeks very
quickly I have the essence silky touch
blush in the shade adorable and then for
my contour I actually use the take home
the bronze shade by the balm and this I
believe is the lightest shade so we're
gonna go ahead and go for now and we'll
be back in just a second eight hours
from now and we'll see how this worked
for the day and I'll give you
some final thoughts all right oh I left
my phone downstairs okay you're just
gonna have to believe me it's like 10:30
at night my kids finally fell asleep oh
my gosh we are here to do the final look
at the kat von d palette and how it
looks you know we've got some serious
transferring and what's crazy is the
side that I use the NYX glitter glue on
it actually transferred more so what I'm
thinking I might have done is I may have
put the glitter glue on and then the
glitter glue was still tacky when I
opened my eye making glitter glue
transfer up to my brow bone making the
glitter stick to my brow bone more let
me show you what I'm talking about all
right let me close see what I'm saying
see how the glitter transferred on my
brow bone is so much brighter on the NYX
glitter glue side then on this side
isn't that crazy
so I really think that was operator
error on my part but it does seem that
as far as fallout on the face we've got
a little bit more on the non glitter
glue side but this is definitely not a
deal-breaker amount of glitter on my
cheeks but I'm surprised that the Mac
Paint Pot was able to hold on to these
glitters so well because like I said
that gold is super chunky my still my
biggest complaint about the wear of this
is the green shades I feel like they're
just not great I think that if you're
really good with eyeshadow you'll
probably be better at it than I am will
probably get better wear time out of
them less patchiness more blend ability
but for me and my skill level it just it
was it's not working for me but if you
look at like the lower lash line it
still looks really really good I mean
overall it looks great again if you'd
like to know more information about this
palette I do have my full review and my
full thoughts on all of this along with
ingredient analysis and value and
packaging and all of that in a separate
video I'm working on this format trying
to figure out how to make the videos
shorter it's so easy easier to digest
into two pieces
you have suggestions for that I'm
totally open for it and if you have
experiences with the Kat Von D 10th
anniversary palette I would love to know
your thoughts in the comments below in
the collective brain of makeup
awesomeness where we help each other not
