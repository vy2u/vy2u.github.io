crazy I just did this look with this
palette and I can't believe I did that
that's dumb ok if you are not aware Kat
Von D came out with her 10 year
anniversary palette it is extremely
colorful and fun but the question is is
this going to be a good palette for you
and hopefully that'll be a question that
we can answer right now let's go ahead
and get started
her request of lots and lots and lots of
people I am going to try something new
with my reviews I'm going to be
splitting them up into two parts and
this is the first time that I've done
this and I would love to get your
feedback down in the comments below this
video is going to be all about Kat Von D
beauty as a brand the ingredients that's
what you get for your value what this is
all about and my full review of the
product in a separate video you'll see
the two demos and wear tests and also
the swatches so we're dealing we're
splitting it into information and then
performance so this is the information
video I will link the performance video
down below I'm hoping I can get them to
go live on the same day that's the goal
so this look that I'm wearing right now
is the second look it was my challenge
look and it was really fun to create I
don't know how well I pull it off but I
feel like I did okay so just a little
bit first about the brand Kat Von D
beauty is a kendo brand which is the
same brand that owns Fenty by Rihanna
and they are sold at Kat Von D beauty
calm as well as Sephora calm hello
editing Jen here so my friend Georgia
just informed me that this palette is
currently sold out both at Sephora and
Kat Von D's website however Kat Von D
does have a little button that says
notify me when available on her website
so I'm hoping that it will come back
either way I hope you still enjoy this
video even though it currently seems
like it is sold out they are a vegan and
cruelty-free brand and this product is
made in the US in this palette you do
get 16 shades and most of these are
matte you're only getting one two three
four five shimmer slash metallic shades
the rest are matte these are 1.7 gram
pans which is quite nice it's not
generous but it's not cheap either and
that breaks down to three dollars and
twenty-five cents per shadow if you're
breaking this down to price per gram
we've got twenty seven point two grams
of product total which will give you a
dollar ninety one per gram and that is
really good for a product sold at
Sephora Too Faced products will usually
run you a little over two dollars like
225 a gram Urban Decay run you around
three dollars a gram on a stocky or on
you around four seventy five to five
dollars a gram so this is actually a
really good deal if you're planning on
hitting pan on it I mean I love about
this is how hardcore this packaging is
it is so insane it is very heavy it
reminds me a lot of the Pat McGrath
weight of a palette but at a fraction of
the price if you don't know Pat McGrath
eyeshadows are considered luxury
eyeshadows and the packaging is insanely
beautiful and it is very heavy and
they're about a hundred and twenty-five
dollars I want to say for Less shadows
than this it is not really authentic
gold looking but that's okay it's got
this beautiful art design on the front
and you may know that Kat Von D does do
the art for her product she's got a
little signature there it's beautiful
the shade names are listed on the back
which I don't prefer I would much rather
than be printed on the inside also this
does fit up finger prints as well so
keep that in mind it does have a click
closure which is really nice for travel
because I feel like magnetic closures
are more likely to hit into something
and open up and travel but it is a click
closure which is great and the color
scheme is very rainbow like but it's not
a bright rainbow let me go ahead and get
something for you so this is the me vida
loca palette that was super super
popular when it came out this is what it
looks like and you'll be able to see
that this one is quite a bit brighter
than the anniversary palette it's very
different very very different and
honestly I like the color scheme of the
me vida loca better but I can see some
people liking this one better I think
that one's going to come up to personal
preference as far as ingredients go just
some things to be aware of this does
have talc and mica in it some people are
sensitive to talc and some people do not
buy mica prod
for human rights reasons the
preservative in here is phenoxyethanol
there are no parabens in here but some
people are sensitive as a phenoxyethanol
so if that's you this is not going to be
a product for you most makeup products
at this point do have phenoxyethanol as
the preservative it also has silica in
it which some people can be sensitive to
and dimethicone which also some people
can be sensitive to one big one is
something that can be used kind of a
long width out but it's considered a
pigment it's called bismuth oxychloride
each one of these eyeshadows does have a
different formula but bismuth
oxychloride is in a lot of them so if
you are sensitive to it then this is
definitely not going to be something
that will probably be worth your
investment bismuth oxychloride has a
micro crystalline structure so it can
for people with sensitive skin it can
kind of poke in the pores and it can
scratch very very tiny make these little
tiny scratches in the skin but if you
are not super sensitive you probably
won't notice I have never had a problem
with businees muth oxychloride but i
know that a lot of my subscribers have
so that's why i am mentioning it one
thing that is brand new that i am so
excited about is on Sephora's website
they actually have the ingredients
listed I have never seen a cat Von D
product ever have ingredients listed
online in fact I took the time to look
at the box and type up all of the
ingredients for this product only to go
over to Sephora and realize they were
already all there so one thing also to
keep in mind is if you do want to tap
these on onto the lips some of these
pigments are not lips safe such as
ferric ferrocyanide chromium oxide
greens and what's the other one there's
one more got it
ultramarine ultramarines is the other
one so you can check and see which ones
are not lips safe on the Sephora website
now as far as my personal opinion of
this palette I like it I don't love it
and let me tell you why I don't love it
I find this palette to be very difficult
to work with especially in comparison
with other Kat Von D eyeshadow palettes
that I've bought in the past and
especially when it comes to these shades
over on this side these two shades in
particular they are really hard to work
with they come out very patchy on the
eye when you use a lighter fluffier
brush to kind of get those into the
crease they
just our really really really patchy
it's horrible so you really have to use
these at full strength in order to get
them to look good on your I there's no
halfway in between it's either go or
don't go these over here are a little
bit easier to work with they're a little
bit more fun to work with as far as the
glitter fallout throughout the day
I haven't had and that much difficulty
with that for the most part no matter
what I use the glitter fallout is not
happening on the cheeks throughout the
day you definitely want to use a primer
with them but other than that it's it's
really glitter fallout has not been a
problem I have had some transfer onto my
brow bone throughout the day which isn't
a huge deal breaker for me when it looks
like I've just been farted on by a fairy
like that is when I know that I've got
something I just can't even deal with
but I don't have that problem with this
so we're good there I do find as someone
that is not very good at selecting
colors for eyeshadows I do find it very
difficult to figure out which shadows I
want to use from this and make a
cohesive look when I go with this all on
my own without having looked at anybody
else's idea I have a lot of trouble
figuring out what I want to do how I
want to work with it I have to look for
in SPO in order to do something with
this you will see one that I created all
on my own though in the other video so
if you are a beginner with eyeshadows
you may want to start using this as kind
of a supplemental palette - maybe some
other palettes that you own just pop one
of these shades in there and you still
might be able to get some good use out
of it but for me when I've just kind of
gone off and tried to use this palette
has turned into a hot mess for the most
part I do feel like this would be great
for many skin tones I feel like the
pigmentation is definitely there for
deeper skin tones so am I happy that I
bought this not really to be honest with
you I'm not really happy that I bought
it it because the fun factor isn't there
for me it's too complicated for me the
fact that I have to look up an in spot
in order to know what to do with this to
realize there are some of these shades
that I can't just put on my eyes and
enjoy and have fun using that I'm gonna
struggle trying to get them to look nice
on my eyes without it being patchy is
not fun for me I don't enjoy that so no
I'm not happy with this purchase I will
I keep it because I do have a Kat Von D
eyeshadow collection it's nice for
duping purposes I know that this has
been very popular that a lot of people
are buying it so it's gonna be great for
me to have for my collection but overall
I don't see myself reaching for this
very often and I'm honestly not happy
with the purchase at all so that's it
for this video I feel like I need to
keep talking that the video is too short
but we're gonna go ahead and cut it off
here because there is a second part to
this video again we'll be linked down
below and that is the to wear tests and
the swatches if you're interested in
that you can definitely head over there
the two of these videos together should
combine to make a full-length Jen Lowe's
reviews review video if you have tried
this palette I would love to know your
thoughts what are some of your favorite
shades to work with what are some of the
shades you're having difficulty working
with definitely let us know in the
collective brain of mega awesomeness

and divide things that are totally worth
it definitely leave your thoughts down
below and if you're new here welcome
