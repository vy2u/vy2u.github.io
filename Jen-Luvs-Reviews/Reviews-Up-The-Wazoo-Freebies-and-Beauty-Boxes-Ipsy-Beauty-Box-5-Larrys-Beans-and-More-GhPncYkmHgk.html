watching a gazillion beauty box opening
videos so i decided that i'm not going
to do them anymore i am going to put all
of my freebies and beauty boxes all
together in this glorious package is
just for use you can see everything at
once so there's going to be a nice mix
of food and beauty products and all
kinds of good things but not together
because we don't want to eat our beauty
products and the most exciting thing
that I got I have to show you I got an
insane amount of coffee and i'm so
excited about this it would be wired for
the rest of my life thank you to Larry's
beans for sending me this amazing coffee
I am they're out of North Carolina and I
entered a contest of theirs um I don't
even know when a long time ago I
undergone does the Bears and I won and
it was like a and sending like a text
message or send an email and you can win
a year's worth of coffee I got eight
bags um 8 12 ounce bags of coffee and
this is only half of what I'm gonna be
getting which is craziness this coffee
is like true real coffee like we're not
like talking about starbucks flavored
you know girly coffee this is like
coffee like no joke this one is the bean
Martin roast and it's slow roasted
elegant darkness buzzing with dark cocoa
and Barry I don't really taste the very
in this one but that definitely tastes a
little bit of dark cocoa which is yummy
yummy yummy we also tried the cowboy
blend which is a bold smoky widebody and
burrows Java for the prairie and this
one actually really really like I didn't
think I would like it I thought it was
going to be too strong for me but it's
not um it's very very very yummy and
delicious um just real rich coffee these
are the other ones that I have not tried
this one is the El Salvador Dali blend
isn't that cute I love that name it's
got hint a surprising hint of s'mores so
I think this is going to be the next one
that I opened so I'm looking forward to
that one also got this mountain Sumatra
yum yum fair trade Farm co-op start
schools amazing that they do things like
that Larry's beans
this one is a Frenchie French rose this
one is Frankie's blends and this is a
sumatra with a secret sidekick it has
hints of toasty caramel in this one yums
and then this one is three moon Peru so
um just coffees from all over the world
and I've never tasted a lot of these
never tasted in El Salvadorian coffee
I've never tasted a Peruvian coffee so
I'm really excited to try these so thank
you so much Larry's beans for sending me
my coffee and for being so patient with
me about me getting back to you with my
flavors than you think thank you you
guys you're awesome next freebie that I
got was from buzz agent and I love buzz
agent because influenster has been
annoying lately like they've wanted you
to do photo contest so for a chance to
win a coupon and like you know watch
this television show and go to the live
chat I don't want to do any of that I
just want to just answer survey and send
me stuff and I'll tell you what you
think and I'll make a video about it you
just you know it's not being so
complicated influenster just send me
some stuff like buzz agent does and this
was the lysol touch of foam
antibacterial hand wash and this is in
creamy vanilla orchid smells really good
it's like you know regular creamy and it
smells a very um very floral it's more
floral than vanilla but really like this
and it's got a really honestly like it
kind of it doesn't dry out my hands you
know you get that squeaky clean clean
feeling from some soaps this does not do
that it's got a moisturizing kind of
feeling to it so I will definitely be
repurchasing this I would rather
purchase this then some of the
higher-end foaming um soaps that I've
gotten because it smells so good and
because it doesn't have that drying
effect ivano rinse this hand off I'll be
right back
ok I'm back ok also absolutely loving
still loving my Gray's box you can only
get a subscription of this in the United
States if you know someone that I was
already doing it and everybody only gets
one code i got mine from my girl Lizzie
josh and i gave away my code to somebody
on my facebook if you're not on the
facebook account go join that i will put
a link down below I put all coupons when
I know about them and offers and and
things that I get and things I know
about I put them on my Facebook first so
um yeah grace box is amazing you get
these little snacky snacks I got cheddar
gorge again which the cheddar cashews
are amazing banana off the pie
Scandinavian forest which is a mix of
just dried fruits this one on banana off
you pie is banana fudge almonds and
pecans and the cheddar gorge is cheese
cashew salsa corn sticks and herb
crackers if you want to know more about
the grace box I do have a video about
this that i will link right here on the
box and you click on that and learn more
about grace box if you like okay also
got my goodies box a lot of sugary
products in here this was really good
this alo comfort watermelon peach aloe
vera juice I enjoy aloe vera juice it's
got a little bit of a thickness to it
that you might not be used to it's also
got chunks of aloe floating in there but
honestly it more felt like chunks of
watermelon to me even though I'm pretty
sure it was a low and really enjoyed
this it does have 17 grams of sugar for
half of the bottle which is a lot of
sugar but for an everyone smile drink it
was very refreshing really enjoyed that
we got a few cookie type products these
are all supposed to breakfast foods
these are cookies to me i don't think i
would choose to do them for breakfast
this is the breakfast cookie sorry i
catch you fighting so this one's by
aarons Baker's it's a breakfast cookie
um and it was fine I might have this
like on the side of having a real
breakfast has this is like a light note
on the end of my real breakfast but I
would never eat this as an entire
breakfast anyways getting fig newtons
for breakfast stop now is is a cookie it
is not breakfast even if it says one
hundred percent whole grains that does
not count
at the ridiculous amount of sugar this
is a candy bar it has more sugar than a
snickers bar it has 22 grams of sugar in
this thing at 200 calories I'm sorry 22
grams of sugar is to me is just sick I
don't care how many calories are in this
like don't eat this for breakfast this
is dessert also with this Velveeta
cookies just ridiculously process we're
very very hard probably would not eat
this for breakfast probably wouldn't
even eat it for dessert because it's
just so it's just not the type of cookie
I would normally eat this instant
breakfast by flavor flavor is the name
of the brand flavor that's as good as
you could do flavor Oh Joe Vaughn's pure
nutrition out of Washington yovan's calm
this was actually pretty good and this
would be a good alternative if you
really like the UM the carnation instant
breakfast I think this was creamier but
had a similar flavor and it's all
natural I wouldn't eat this for
breakfast for breakfast because i feel
like it's just not food but um if you're
in a pension this is something that you
do I think this might be a nice
alternative just because it's more
natural than the carnation bone among on
strawberry preserves tastes like
strawberry preserves um I think they
trick you by putting this in this like
grandma-looking container making you
feel like grandma made it you know but I
mean it's just strawberries sugar for
pectin I'm a strawberry preserves I was
good but it's nothing spectacular final
thing we got was this vanilla almond una
one hundred percent natural hand bake
granola um nice to sprinkle on things I
guess maybe on some Greek plain Greek
yogurt not a ridiculous amount of sugar
really nice flavor enjoyed this so that
was the goodies box total value was
8,000 67 cents i paid seven dollars for
it um what's fun to try some of the
stuff I don't know how much longer I'm
going to keep this one up just because
it's a lot of foods that I don't
normally eat um you know I don't know
we'll see we'll see I really did like
that a low water though I was pretty
delicious now moving on to beauty boxes
beauty box five was so so this month we
know I'm just going to put the picture
there because
I just got our bathroom remodel and like
he'll find anything the tree hut lotion
was pretty good really nice um works
very well they love fresh nail polish
remover wipes really like those worked
very well for travel would repurchase
those if I felt the need to have travel
nail polish remover wipes the eyeshadow
was so so lasting power was so so
blending was so so probably would not
repurchase that the eye cream I actually
really like my only complaint was the
sample size they give you the little
teeny tiny tube and you squeeze half of
it you're still not getting in product
out or but the actual product itself
I've actually really enjoying I think it
might actually be minimizing my wrinkles
around my eyes what I haven't checked on
the full price of it but I'm going to
check on it because that could be a
possible repurchase possibly the the
body wash um made my skin really dry had
dry patches like she still have a dry
patch don't know if you can see that
it's kind of gross i guess to show you
my dry patch but um yeah gave me dry
patches on my arms and on my legs so i
will not be using that soap anymore okay
i know people were just being nice about
the MC box but I thought the Ipsy box
was a box I thought the Ipsy dad was
terrible this month I was awful it was
by far the worst beauty box bag I've
gotten since sample society I mean it
was terrible um actually might even
worse than the sample society bag boxes
that I got before um yeah the worst
thing by far to me was that juice beauty
sprite okay it's the spray and you spray
it and it smells like bug spray to me it
smells awful and you spray and then it
goes and it like get you in your face
and it's like you know and you just get
sprayed with the spray and Waymire Oh
one who's one of my amazing subscribers
love this stuff I will be sending it to
you if you want it you can have it
because I know you really liked it um
the eyeshadows were okay the one eye
shadow work pretty well the other eye
shadow was not pigmented at all I got
like the beige in the reddish kind of
color the reddish brown color not work
the little um
the little makeup is little mini Z
palette thing was cute I did try to deep
pot some of my Coastal Scents I shadows
that we had gotten from ypsi before and
you can see the disaster that that was
almost set my house on fire um the smell
from the burning plastic it was just the
disaster and that's my fault that is
nothing to do with FC that's me being an
idiot and not knowing how to deep odd
things but it went really really badly
and when I did get them out they still
didn't stick I don't even have magnets
to go on I'm like it's terrible it's a
bad situation with that little mini Z
palette um and it's so small you can't
really fit anything in it um except for
the little teeny tiny circles and I'm
not buying any more of those baby
whatever JB JB yeah behaved me
eyeshadows not buying anymore because
they were just terrible quality unlike
everybody else you seem to love the bag
I thought the bag was atrocious like I
am NOT a nautical stuff at all I thought
it was just ugly I mean somebody
mentioned that it might be good in like
a beach bag yeah sure okay um but no I
didn't enjoy the bag I thought it was
really cheap I thought it was really
ugly did not like it they look fresh uh
make up a member wife's did not work
they didn't work they got like some of
my foundation off but they did nothing
for my eye makeup didn't even make a
dent and maybe that's just credit to my
our eye makeup because I my I have good
eye makeup or something but it just did
not come off it didn't work I had to get
my Neutrogena wipe and wipe again
because the little fresh ones were so
stinking terrible and they only sent us
like four products this month they sent
us um well unless you count the 2 little
teeny tiny eyeshadows stupid but I'm
really looking for in my FC bag this
month because last month was so bad and
it can't be any worse than last month
and it makes me mad ypsi because I
recommend if C to everybody and it makes
me sad when people when I recommend
something and it ends up being terrible
that was the last month for my friend
Kenda I bought her a gift subscription
for Christmas and that was for last
month she happened to enjoy a lot of
products in it but I just thought it was
awful so I apologize to anybody that
bought the FC bag and ooh and thought
they were going to love it and then he
it was my fault because I'm sorry please
please if she do me good for April I see
that it's going to probably be pink
stuff I'm looking forward to the pink
because I love pink so come on if C do
me right for April blue so the best
things of this past month this time for
freebies and beauty boxes were Larry's
beans rocks my buzz adria a jet life's
all soapy stuff and my graze box
subscriptions are definitely tops for me
