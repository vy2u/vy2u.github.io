to the drugstore just pick one up so I'm
always looking for a good at drugstore
liquid eyeliner hello my friends welcome
to my review of these relatively new
liquid eyeliners by Revlon there are
three new ones that they all have three
different tips and I bought them because
I am a liquid eyeliner junkie you are
supposed to throw liquid eyeliners away
after three months so I'm constantly
going through them trying new formulas
just trying different things seeing if I
can get a deal instead of paying for
more expensive eyeliners like the Marc
Jacobs one that I love I also love the
Kat Von D one this the Stila one the
tattoo liner is the one that I love from
Kat Von D just there's some really great
options in Sephora but it's nice to find
a drugstore option I do also really like
the Tarte so fine one and also Jesse's
girl but that one's really hard to get
unless you order it online you know it's
just it's a nice people to go to the
drugstore just pick one off so I'm
always looking for a good a drugstore
liquid eyeliner so I bought all three of
them to see if there was a difference to
see if there was worth purchasing all of
them or any of them so let me go ahead
and get into the specifics of these as
far as cost why these are actually a
really really good value if you're going
to use a lot of the liquid product I did
a little cost breakdown a la stephanie
nicole and i found out that these are
six dollars and 25 cents per milliliter
if you break down the the milliliters
because you get one point six
milliliters of product for ten dollars
now if you break that down against the
Jessi scroll which is a seven dollar
product theirs are 14 dollars per
milliliter you go to the Kat Von D
you're talking 27 dollars a milliliter
Stila 48 at four dollars a milliliter
and the Marc Jacobs is $60 per
milliliter of fluid so it's definitely a
great deal as far as how much product
you get in these like I mentioned before
there are three different tips this one
is my least favorite this one is called
the triple edge now the idea behind this
is you are supposed to be able to get
three different looks by using the three
different edges now my problem with it
is that
all three edges were very thick and I
don't personally like very thick
eyeliner so this one was a big note for
me just because I find that it's
difficult to apply in a way that I enjoy
but if you like a one swipe very thick
look then this might be the tip for you
the next one that is a less favorite one
is the ballpoint one that is this one
and it does have a little bit of a ball
on the shape on the end but it's not an
actual ball I was thinking even more
like a ballpoint pen kind of formula I
don't know as far as the form of the the
tip goes but it's really just a straight
tip and then it's got kind of a rounded
end and this one is also kind of
difficult to use in that it can get very
thick as far as I you know I'm just
learning that I'd like a really really
fine point and that's just me personally
because I like to do a wing if you don't
like to do a wing then this one actually
might be better for you because it is
the rounded form a really is nice for on
the lid it does feel really good it goes
on very smoothly straight onto the lid
but the wing is a little bit difficult
with this one so I don't know this one
I personally would rather have the
classic which is the last one the
classic one is just your standard marker
tip nothing special about it you can get
the next one's very similar
most most pen eyeliners that are markers
style look exactly like this nothing
outstanding about it but it does get a
nice fine point for the wing which is
what I'm looking for I can get it really
close to my lash line the ballpoint
actually goes very close to the lash
line as well just both of them are very
very nice for getting close to the lash
line but there's nothing extraordinary
about it now let's talk about the
formula very very very black I am
wearing it today on my lids it's an
extremely black opaque line very easy to
go on my only complain about these is
they will smudge like crazy through the
day they never completely dry down so
what you're looking at is during the day
going like this accidentally and you
have a big smear up the side of your
face and you don't even know it
that's not okay with me because I do a
wing pretty much every day if you don't
do a wing and you don't rub your eyes
you will probably really really like
this formula a lot if you have oily lids
or if you have especially watery eyes
you may have difficulty with it just
because of the natural oils or water
that are getting on it may interfere
with the performance and may make it
smudge or smear for me these were a no
they're going to be a not recommend
because from my particular purposes they
are not good in that I need my wing to
last and these do not make my wing last
that I found no difference between the
different formulas of the individual
pens the formula seems to be exactly the
same inside and I saw no difference in
how it came out depending on the tip
that I use it came out just depending on
what how the tip was not because the
formula was different or it seemed to
come out differently because of the
different tip they're all marker based
tips there's no you know some of them
have some eyeliners have brush tips
these do not have brush tips they're all
marker tips so unfortunately they're not
a recommend specifically for my purposes
but like I said they may work for some
people and also like I said they're an
excellent value for the amount of
product that you get
but keep in mind again you're supposed
to be trading these out every three
months you may not even need that much
product so you may not go through it in
three months it just kind of depends on
your own personal usage so that's my
