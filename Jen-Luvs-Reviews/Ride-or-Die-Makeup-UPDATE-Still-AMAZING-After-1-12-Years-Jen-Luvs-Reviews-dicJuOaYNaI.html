years ago to a year and a half ago do
you remember this tag was everywhere the
riders I tagged by Jacqueline Hill
everybody and their grandmother we're
doing this tag I got a request from one
of my awesome followers on Twitter her
name is Kayla her and Kayla said Jen can
you do an updated version of your rotten
tried or died tag and I was like
actually a really good idea Kayla thank
you so much for that idea so that's what
we're gonna get into right now and I've
got an entire like TV tray full of stuff
to share with you so if you're
interested in hearing about some of my
ride-or-die products currently and
whether the video that I made a year and
a half ago whether those are still some
of my ride-or-die products then hang
tight you're in the right place it's
coming at you right now
so let's go ahead and get started with
the kind of overall arching theme of
what I've learned in the past year and a
half and the biggest thing I've learned
in the past year and a half is that I
don't have ride-or-die specific products
anymore overall there is always
something that can be replaced with
something else because I've just tried
so many products and there's just so
many really good products out there now
they're just as amazing so we're gonna
go over a lot of things the first
category is face primer and the one that
I talked about in my video was the Josie
Maran Argan daily moisture face primer I
still really like that primer at least I
liked it until I started going bad and I
had to throw it away but I have no
problems with that face primer it's
still very nice but I really don't feel
like I have a ride-or-die face primer I
feel like I kind of go to my drawer and
what am I feeling today what do I feel
like using and you know what am i trying
and and it really doesn't matter a whole
lot to me
overall I either like a primer or I hate
it it's like one or the other I don't
know but the one I've been reaching for
the most that I wouldn't call a
ride-or-die necessarily but I've been
reaching for it the most is the Too
Faced primed and peachy cooling matte
primer this is it just smells good and
it feels good and it seems to go with
all of my foundations doesn't give me a
problem so I've been using this a lot
and I can't say enough good things about
it the only thing is the scent if scents
bother you you want to
stay away from it but but yeah I've had
no problems with this and I've been
really liking it so I guess that's my
ride-or-die if I had to pick one but for
I primary this is one that I found very
interesting I have the exact same Holy
Grail eye primer as I did a year and a
half ago and that is the Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer potion in Eden it needs
out this coloration which is something
that I personally really really love but
I also have to add in the Ulta eye
primer and I did mention this in that
video that I was wondering if they were
the same and I find them to be the same
as far as they're not you know shadows
not creasing on me increasing the
lasting power things like that if I had
to pick between the two I would pick the
Urban Decay because I do feel like it's
a little more opaque in the color as it
applies to the lid where this one is
just a little bit more sheer so I mean
really I could do either one as far as
the functionality of it but I like to
eat in just a little bit better for
foundation my ride-or-die foundation
back then because I had to pick one with
the Lumine time free CC cream I did run
out of that I no longer own that and now
at this point I just kind of have some
things that are just my favorites that I
pulled for I did not pull out the elf
moisturizing foundation stick because
lately it's been kicking up on me a
little bit around my nose so I kind of I
still like it but I don't know I think
the formula might be changing a little
bit in that I don't feel like it's as
smooth as it was my first bought it I
don't know so I didn't include that
today I am wearing the ultd Emme matte
foundation this is another one that I
discovered not too long I think I might
have even discovered it right around the
same time that video went live but I
hadn't used it enough to call it any
kind of ride-or-die this foundation is
fantastic it's a little bit more full
coverage but it's beautiful it gives a
beautiful finish and lasting power is
wonderful it's not very expensive and I
definitely recommend this one I wanted
to mention is this one by a brand called
clay I've talked about this quite a few
times as well I got this with FC points
and I'm so so thankful
it is a Korean beauty product and what
shade is this this is the shade light
hello editing Jen here I just wanted to
let you know that this video was filmed
before I kind of had an awakening about
shade ranges and inclusivity and before
I realized just how many women
color watch my channel and enjoy my
reviews I think that if I had filmed
this video after all the things went
down with the brand new Tarte shape tape
foundation I would have had kind of a
different way that I explained these two
foundations I do want to let you know
that I am now committing to only
reviewing and purchasing foundations and
concealers that do have inclusive shade
ranges these two that I mentioned in
this video have mediocre shade ranges
they're not horribly awful but they're
not great I will put in the images right
now so you can see what the shade
offerings are there's definitely worse
out there but they're not good so I
definitely would have made a different
choice if I had filmed this video kind
of after my big awakenings I just wanted
to mention that and now let's go ahead
and get to the video the clay one though
it's one of those that it's like a
color-changing let me show you in case
you've never seen a BB cream or
foundation that's like this so as soon
as you squeeze it out it looks white but
then as you rub it in it does this
changing of color to a skin tone and I
just really love this I think it gives a
little bit more of a luminescence a
little bit more due eNOS that I really
really love and I'm very thankful that I
found that through epsy points it's
pretty awesome and lasting power is very
very very good now as far as pressed
powder my Holy Grail pressed powder is
one that I still really like but I
haven't reaching for it as much lately
it is the Milani multitasker powder
still really really good these are the
ones I've been reaching for it lately
though
one is from bareMinerals this is their
Bayer Pro and warm light it's a little
bit dark for me but I still really like
it a lot and it just kind of mattifies
my du eNOS a little bit it just kind of
locks down my foundation and I do really
like it even though it is a little bit
dark I think that I've got this from
bareMinerals at an Ipsy event and then
this is the it cosmetics your skin a
better CC plus airbrush perfecting
powder their names are insane this one
has also been very very good for me and
I've been I've been enjoying it it comes
with a little powder puff in the back
that I appreciate and I found that I do
really like these applied with either a
very dense brush or a powder puff like
that I guess I guess that's silicone I
don't know what this is mean of these
little foamy guys
there it's very nice because I feel like
I can really pack the powder onto my
face
it's the bareMinerals original mineral
veil I still really like that one but I
want to add two more the laura mercier
translucent powder this was sent to me
by Influenster which is a program that
anybody can sign up for and get free
product sent definitely consider joining
that especially if you have any kind of
social media presence I don't even think
you have to have a minimum number of
followers but if you have an Instagram
if you have a Twitter if you have a
youtube you can sign up any of those or
all of those you can set it for
Influenster it's really really awesome
so basically Influenster you they send
you a product and then they just ask you
to post things to your social media and
leave reviews at different specific
places and they just want you to be
honest which is great but yeah this is
very very finely milled it's very nice
let me show you the inside it's just got
just the one of those tops that's got
the holes in it nothing magical it did
come with the powder puff but I got rid
of that because I have found I had
trouble using it I'd rather use a dense
makeup brush and then also the Too Faced
peach perfect powder which is another
one that I've talked about a lot
recently I like this one a lot because
it does smell like peaches I don't know
I got a thing with sense I like what
things smell good one thing I love about
this is it does have a plastic top to
keep the product in which is really nice
and honestly I will use all three of
those interchangeably too Laura Mercier
one this one and the bare minerals one
it's one or the other
it doesn't even matter like whichever
one I happen to grab I feel like they
all kind of do the same thing so
eyeshadow palettes are kind of my thing
so thinking about my ride-or-die
eyeshadow palette I just can't pick back
then I picked the Too Faced chocolate
bar palette I would not say that that
palette is anywhere near a ride-or-die
for me anymore I feel like I've gotten
so much more experience with eyeshadow
palettes and I've really been enjoying
some of the brands that I have grown to
love over the past year in house I'm
just gonna flick through those really
quickly first of course coloured raine
love this brand love the formula just
really bold and poppy which is my
personal preference I like foiled
shadows I like metallic shadows I'm not
as much into the matte looks these these
though I will tell you have great matte
shades the coloured raine formula and
the singles are amazing as well if you
just want to try the formula I
definitely recommend getting this
Singles or like they have these smaller
pellets now that are less expensive
definitely recommend this brand it's
wonderful
also the Kat Von D formula I have to
tell you I'm sad that I don't have my
metal mat anymore I believe that it was
stolen from my house when I had people
over don't ask me how that giant palette
got stolen
I don't know but after that party it was
gone it would just wasn't here anymore
and it's a giant palette you can't lose
a giant palette so I'm thinking that it
was stolen I didn't notice anything else
it was stolen but I'm very sad but that
was an amazing palette this is the saint
and sinner palette that i wouldn't say
that this is a ride-or-die palette for
me but i did want to bring it out just
because of the Kat Von D formula is
definitely a ride-or-die formula for me
I love it
next up the lorac formula is amazing
that this was sent to me by lorac this
one I had purchased the lorac formula is
so stinkin good
I haven't used this one a whole lot but
the looks that a couple of looks like
created with this have come out
absolutely beautiful and they are
powdery they kick up a lot of powder but
the end look if you tap off your brush
and you use you know something to
protect your under-eye from any kind of
fallout and or it's just a wonderful
wonderful formula and I have no
complaints about about the lorac formula
other than that it can kick up some
powder but lasting power is incredible
with this next up the next formula is
the Julius Place formula it doesn't
matter which one they're all same
awesome formula there if you're looking
for a lower price point on some
incredible eyeshadows I definitely
recommend you vias place this is the
saharan palette I got this beginning of
last year I haven't pulled for this one
a whole lot but I think it's a color
selection it's not the quality this one
I just got this is the magic palette by
devious place I just purchased this off
of hautelook been really really loving
this she's really intense
I thought kept saying really really
really really really really really it's
so intense and beautiful and amazing and
matte formula is really good as well and
then finally I could not get through
this video I know you guys are gonna
kill me
for mentioning this video again I said I
was gonna leave it in 2017 but I can't
one more time for the people in the back
like jacqueline hill morphe palette is
another one that I just have to mention
again not the other morphe formula just
this formula has been wonderful
wonderful for me as far as lasting power
the mattes the shimmers everything has
been wonderful so those are more
ride-or-die formulas rather than actual
individual pallets if I have to pick an
individual palette like ride-or-die I
would probably have to pick the coloured
raine Queen of Hearts palette I feel
like I could just live in this palette
you know like there's just so many
things that I feel like I would want to
do and enjoy using on a daily basis it's
just a fun palette for me I really enjoy
using it I don't know I just think
they're all just so good they're so good
now in single shadows I talked about the
L'Oreal infallible and iced latte the
L'Oreal infallible single shadows are
all are very very good their new shadows
that blue metallic ones are also really
really good but I would say if I had to
pick like ride-or-die right now it would
definitely be for single shadows the the
ones from geek chic I love these these
are loose mineral powders they're not
pressed powders but man or thing amazing
oh my gosh my absolute favorite is the
one in luckdragon it was from their
neverending story collection it's now in
the single-player section because they
have like collections they just continue
them but they keep some of their best
shades and then also the over shadows by
the balm are also amazing I would say
those if we're going to liquid shadows
the steal of liquid shadows are
incredible I've talked about these a lot
as well just oh my gosh so fun for those
really bright bold glittery looks love
them I know not everybody loves them but
I do and this is about my ride-or-die so
they're my ride-or-die
they're wonderful I love them liquid
eyeliner if you've been around for a
while you know my ride-or-die a year and
a half ago was Jessie's Girl liquid
liner I fell out of love with it I feel
like something changed with the formula
my new ride-or-die that I've talked
about again so many times the NYX epic
ink liner it's amazing it's amazing for
a high end version I would say the
tattoo liner in trooper but I feel like
this is just as good I don't feel like
that I need the tattoo liner in trooper
recently I've had three different people
tell me that this one bleeds everywhere
on them
I have no idea why I've never had a
problem with it bleeding the point is
very very sharp it's very very black it
does everything I want it to do it
hasn't dried out on me I've had this for
what four or five months it's doing
amazing I actually need to purchase a
new one because we really shouldn't keep
these longer than three months kind of
like mascara but mm-hm it's just so good
it's so good at least for me for blush a
year and a half ago my ride-or-die was
Kat Von D's Essex blush this blush has
been discontinued forever I still have
it I still love it it's still wonderful
I really haven't reached for this
recently I think it just kind of got
pushed to the back of the drawer it's
not because I don't love it but I do I
still do love it and then my other rider
died that was still available where the
in stain blushes my collection has grown
I love them so much today I am wearing
pinstripe which is this purpley maulvi
kind of shade it's so pretty but I also
really really love houndstooth this is
the other one that I love but I've worn
these also I mean the last powers
amazing they're not so pigmented that
they're hard to work with and you go
straight to clown face you do still have
to kind of use a light hand but you
don't to be as careful as some other
blushes that are just insanely pigmented
they just build so beautifully and made
the color kind of melds into the skin
and it's just so pretty I love them so
that has not changed that is the same
same thing with highlighter mary-lou
manizer has been my holy Gras holy grail
/ ride-or-die highlighter for a very
very long time still is that is what I'm
wearing on my cheeks today oh it's just
so pretty it's so pretty it was amazing
but if I had to say something that I
think would tie with that it would be
the Oprah highlighters these are
fabulous this one is Rodeo Drive it's
kind of similar to mary lou manizer not
exactly the same but it's kind of
similar and I love these just as much
they're very poppy from space
highlighters which is my personal
preference for contour my ride-or-die a
year and a half ago was the elf contour
kit I still really really liked that one
a lot but I find myself reaching more
for the Anasazi a contour kit I don't
know it's something about the tone of
this shade that I really really like
that's what I'm wearing on my cheeks
today so I've got Mary Lou and then the
balm and then the honest Asya for
contour and really enjoy this and I have
no complaints about it it is a little
bit warm tone so if you prefer something
more cool tone you probably want to go
with
this one this one is the light to medium
one but I've just this is the one I
reach for you know I don't I don't
really know why sometimes your heart
just leads you in a direction you just
have to follow it and my heart leads me
to this one and I can't help it it just
does for mascara I've gone through so
many really good mascaras in the past
year and a half back then it was the
Maybelline lash sensational which I
would imagine is still amazing I haven't
had it since that video and mascaras I
just go through so quickly if I had to
pick a ride-or-die mascara right now it
would be the essence lash princess the
one with the like peach kind of writing
on it the green one's good too but the
peach ish one is my favorite one there I
think there's a purple one now too but
I've never tried that one it just gives
me so much length and so much volume and
it's amazing if I had to pick one be
more expensive I would say Urban Decay
perversion is really really good as well
I feel like they don't clump up on my
lashes I feel like they're just give
this beautiful length beautiful volume
is feel a huge mascara is also amazing
but for drugstore definitely the essence
lash princess is super fab one thing
that Jacqueline included was a setting
spray but I don't do setting sprays at
all I don't like them I don't enjoy them
they feel disgusting to me it just it's
not enjoyable so I don't use setting
sprays for lips Maybelline's touch of
spice has been my color forever along
with Too Faced the chart what is it
called pink chocolate those are both
beautiful shades I still love them very
very much but I haven't been reaching
for them as much I'm gonna kind of tell
you them my ride-or-die formulas that I
really like if I want something unique
and bold and poppy I've been going for
the Rani cosmetics lipsticks I will tell
you right now Shani is a friend of mine
I haven't talked to her in a couple of
months but I would still consider her a
friend of mine and I still very much
enjoy her spark dazzling lipsticks
whenever I want that sparkle and shine
other ones that I've tried recently that
I very much enjoy are the ones by the
brand called collab that you can get at
Sally Beauty Supply I did a whole video
on the collab line that I will link down
below that's what I'm wearing on my lips
today I think that I'm pretty sure I'm
wearing really on my lips today it's
this one right here it's a matte very
very nice also very much shocker
really
the two-faced lipsticks that came out
this year these are the peach the ones
that came out with their peach
collection I have sex on the peach and
drunk-dial
I did that video recently with my
husband where I had kind of a gray toned
lipstick that was sex on the peach that
I was wearing in that video and
drunk-dial is like a deeper purple and
they're just very comfortable they smell
good they feel good it was really good
but if you want to go less expensive I
feel like the collab ones are just as
good in my opinion
for liquid lipsticks I have a bunch of
formulas that I love the ofra liquid
lipsticks are still some of my favorites
I feel like if you like liquid lipsticks
there's things that you like about them
so there's the spectrum and a very
fluffy very moosie doesn't dry down all
the way to dries down completely and is
completely kiss proof the downside of
the whippy ones that don't dry down is
that the lasting power tends to not be
great the downside of the ones that dry
down completely are that they tend to be
uncomfortable
I find the Ofra wants to fall in the
middle of that spectrum something that
is more whippy we've got a couple of
different formulas I've got me I don't
know why I forgot to grab one of the
bare minerals once the bare minerals Gen
nude line is very whippy the M cosmetics
is almost an identical formula to those
there they're just as good they're
literally almost formula dupes the M
cosmetics and the bare minerals ones
also the ones from julep are amazing
those are the more whippy ones as far as
ones that dry down completely my
favorite version will look very very
close to completely the dose of colors
ones that I've talked about a lot this
one is in the shade truffle this one
would be my ride-or-die from this brand
a year and a half ago I wasn't wearing
lip glosses now I am the bareMinerals
one as well I really like this one is in
the shade tantalize it doesn't really
matter they're all very consistent in
formula the lip glosses from
bareMinerals
they're very very nice I also like the
fancy Beauty one that I forgot that
one's very very nice but I would say if
I had to pick a formula that is my
ride-or-die I would say the lorac
formula I got the beauty and the beast'
lip glosses from that collection and
also I got this one from the Pirates of
the Caribbean collection I want this
shade and a full-size this one right
here this one is called Sparrow I
believe and it's kind of an iridescent
purple it's what I
the fenty the glittery gloss to be this
one is it it's just oh it's so good it's
so good it's just very comfortable and
it isn't sticky there isn't a strong
strong scent to it and they're all just
really really good I really like the
lorac glosses now finally the last thing
is makeup brushes i believe i added this
I don't think Jacqueline had this in the
video but I think I added it I the Yves
pearl fan brush on there still
absolutely love that brush for highlight
and everyone small for a very light
contour I mostly use it for a highlight
though I'm gonna combine this with my
favorite brush brand because I have to
brush brands that are my favorites and I
can't pick between them because they're
equally as good and that's Moda and Luxy
i do still love the beauty junkies
brushes which was my ride-or-die
brush brand last year and a half but
these are kind of my new ones they've
kind of taken over even though I still
very much use my beauty junkies brushes
now these are the prismatic collection
by Mota they're absolutely beautiful my
favorite brushes by them are the smoky
eye brush the smudger brush the brow
brush because I use this not only for my
brows but also to smoke out my lower
lash line a bit and then the crease
brush it's really really nice to get
color into the crease without it being
super intense my favorite brushes by
Luxy are this one right here this is the
small tapered blending brush
it's the 231 I love this one also for
kind of blending out the crease and
detailing in there and then this face
brush this is the 500 for the large
angled brush I also really like their
tapered highlighter brush but I couldn't
find it I don't know where what I did
with it I couldn't find it that's
another one that I really really like
and honestly they tie for me they're
both they're amazing brushes and really
fun to use they they don't give me any
problems they don't shed they don't
change colors on me there's nothing
weird happening with them they're very
very soft and they're consistently good
from both brands so I would say they tie
they tie at this point I'm going to turn
the conversation over to you I would
love to know what your Rider dye
products are what are some of the things
that you just constantly reach for that
you love and also have those things
changed over the years was there
something that surprised you that you
used to really really love but you kind
of move
dawn from it and that's just not your
thing anymore or you found something
better to replace it let's have a big
old conversation so we can all learn
from each other in the collective brain
of makeup awesomeness which is what we
all are here working together to not buy
things that are crap and buy things that
are amazing so I want to thank you so
