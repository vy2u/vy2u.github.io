hook but it's day seven of the vlog
we've already been driving for how long
a long time half hour two and a half
hours three hours two and a half three
hours and we've got six hours left
because we had to go to the best buy
because the stupid buttheads stole my
camera out of the car with a charger and
my battery so we finally were able to
find a best buy because apparently
there's like one best buy in the entire
state of Wyoming maybe to know there's a
couple yeah there's there's a couple in
Colorado but we had passed them when it
was the best buys were closed so we
couldn't go backward we had to go
forward so now it's 238 we're gonna find
something quick to eat possibly and then
we are headed to Yellowstone I'm not
sure exactly what's going to happen at
Yellowstone because here's the deal but
when you get to Yellowstone the
everything is already booked up its like
the pre book stuff like when even when
we tried a few weeks ago to get spots we
couldn't so we have to do the first come
first serve but by the time we get there
in six hours the office is going to be
closed so and if its weight is it closed
possible possibly it might be closed and
if it's not closed chances of us getting
a campsite tonight are like zero so
we're kind of going back and forth
between sleeping in the car or sleeping
in a hotel not sure exactly we're gonna
do I don't like
yeah we've got our sleeping in the car
system at this point which is kind of
cool John where do you want to sleep
site you want to sleep in the car you
want to sleep in the hotel I personally
rather get a hotel but we'll see what
happens I don't like you well we'll see
what happens daddy what do you want to
do you don't care ok so we'll find out
later what we end up doing but we're
very excited to finally make it to
Yellowstone driving all the way from
maryland's it's been a long drive and
we're finally at our furthest west point
which is Yellowstone we're almost there
no he's talking about the little know if
you can see them to me I don't see a
little the wiggly guys and wiggle guys
yeah so we will see you in a little
while and we'll update you then ok so
we're back with the update so it looks
like we are going to get to Yellowstone
about 9 45 which is very very late we
looked at some of the hotels in the area
they're all booked up except for to the
cheapest one is 333 dollars and night so
we decided we're going to sleep in our
car tonight it's going to be a lot
easier that way we'll be able to get up
and go to the gets on the front of the
line for getting a campsite so that'll
be good and hope
we will have good luck with that is not
my favorite option but with no hotels
available anywhere near there what else
are we going to do you know the kids are
getting used to sleeping in the car
they've been sleeping in the car for a
few hours a couple of nights so it's
really just me and John kind of getting
used to sleeping in the car but we have
pillows and blankets we were sleeping
bag so we should be fine by going to be
the long
to get there late
to get up stupid early to be in the park
right so it's only going to be like at
seven hours or so we're parked
something like that so you know it's all
good it's ugly not my favorite
arrangement but you do what you got to
do
car sleep and it is but the kids are
doing good yeah okay yeah well like
sleeping in the car you need to learn
this is really cool about the Midwest
let me show you this this is really fun
when I even in the Midwest anymore we're
like in the West now why am I seeing the
Midwest but you can see the storms
coming down so you see the white part
and then the gray is the actual rain
coming down in the distance so if you
look over this way you can see that
those are the storms that we're kind of
going into and you see the bands of rain
over there it's kind of crazy cuz again
I've never seen this because there's no
open spaces like this around us so it's
kind of cool man it's pretty neat
I know what I look like
does it really is amazing all right so
we'll check in with you guys in a little
while that's for a rest stop playgrounds
it's pretty awesome to be able to stop
at this this is called know whether this
rest stop even has a name I don't know
if they have names out here the jersey
ones all have names but it's kind of
cool that they have a little spot where
they can just play for a few minutes so
we had a little minor mishap and that we
got pulled over for speeding cuz my
husband is such a speeder he was going
78 in a 70 mile per hour zone ball
breaker 78 and a 70 true nor from bread
so yeah sounds good so uh yeah so we had
we just got a warning which makes us
really happy i think that the police
officer was just trying to get us to be
safe you know like trying to warn us
about the roads like knowing we were
from out of town you seem like a nice
dude so right now we're pulling over
we're having like a snacky kind of
dinner because we need to keep going so
we're making some of our camp sandwiches
and then we might heat up some of our
rations that we got from rei our outdoor
rations when we get there as dinner we
have a camp stove so we can boil some
water and and heat up some of those for
dinner it's gonna be an interesting
night looking forward to actually
getting a campsite tomorrow cross your
fingers for us papers getting here is
absolutely
