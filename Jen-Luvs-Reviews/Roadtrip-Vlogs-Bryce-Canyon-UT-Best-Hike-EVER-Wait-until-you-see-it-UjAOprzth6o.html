way instead of Zion we did a little bit
of research instead of Siam we're gonna
go to brace Canyon because I think I
mentioned this yesterday but if you
didn't see yesterday's end of the vlog
break as I on it seems like it's more
for older kids and adults a lot of the
trails go on like you have to hold it
onto chain so that you don't fall off
and then some places don't have chains
and there's places where you have to
wade through deep water with current and
it's like you know this may not be the
best for a four year old and an eight
year old so we decided that yeah and
Lila's foot isn't feeling good from when
she jammed it at the mall in say a Salt
Lake City so we are going to Bryce
Canyon instead it seems like there are
some nice easy trails that will lead us
to some cool spots so we're going to
spend the day in Bryce Canyon and then
we're going to be driving to Lake Powell
there's some really cool stuff that we
learned about from the guy in the gift
shop in Salt Lake City he was talking
about some great places at Lake Powell
to rent boats and go on like little like
boat trips and things so we're thinking
about doing that so that'll be tomorrow
so tonight
oh yeah that's right because of when we
were in and where was that in Grand
Teton it was a Grand Teton where the one
was too strong yeah the one was too
strong so we couldn't do a canoe but I
have a feeling that probably won't be an
issue here but you never know so where
we're headed about an hour and a half to
Bryce and then we will both spend the
day there then we'll go to Lake Powell
we'll probably find a campsite at Lake
Powell because we'll have two nights
that we'll get this we'll be able to
spend there and then we'll be headed to
the Grand Canyon so that is the plan and
once we get to Bryce we'll check in with
you
go starting to look like Arizona a
little bit you know we're not going to
Arizona today you're staying in Utah we
can start see those can any looking
things as brown yeah
reddish brown thingies bitter cold from
here we're going down a dirt road
just cuz oh no it said there was a
canyon two miles from here
okay well let's drive there we're
driving on a dirt road to get there
there you go sounds good
check out this check out this little dip
Oh go off it as far as I can don't you
dare don't you dare John
thank you break our car yeah I'm going
nowhere I list you but if you guys
superfast me like fly in the air there
probably would even would broken our car
I feel that does particular
yeah yeah we are at the I don't know if
this is low C or Lucy Canyon trailhead
we're gonna kike to the top of that
thing which should be a lot of fun we've
got our sunscreen on while we've got our
hiking poles we've got water got y'all
they are my hiking poles so that's true
but what Laila's gonna use them and then
John's got his shirt on inside out and
it's all good because he's four and he
can get away with that stuff and I think
we're ready to go John's even got his
bear spray no I don't know if there's
bears around here or there's their bears
around here but I got it all rigged up
old man it does look cool so we got our
sunscreen and we got we're all ready to
go
mine's my face like totally glowing
white I think it is that's okay it's all
good I don't mind because I'm not gonna
get burned today and it's all good so
yeah so I'm excited to hike up that
thing hopefully much but makes it it's
the only I'm worried about is my foot
but we'll be alright
it's a neat little spot right here our
car is all the way out there I can't
believe I know you did all that can you
believe it it's really cool it's cool
archway yeah not a good place to go it's
super cool too dangerous right
super cool
do it again so we made it to the summit
how do you feel good you don't look at
the elevation yeah you made it you did
great
John do you feel very proud of yourself
that you made it all the way up here how
many feet yeah daddy's gonna find out so
I'm gonna give you a little 360 view
what we're looking at here just
incredible yeah we check on you back
yeah so now it's time to make our way
down you guys ready
girl tea is my destiny shut up and dance
with me all right we're gonna listen to
the beautiful music of Lila I was
playing on her new flu
as we drive through the Red Canyon it's
really cool so we are going to be going
on navajo loop which is a 1.3 miles it's
one to two hours this highlights on this
steep loop trail include Wall Street two
bridges and Thor's hammer and 550 feet
of elevation game yeah there you go
there you go that's what we're gonna be
doing are you super excited what do you
think of this view
John what do you think this view
turn there and then I'm just watching
you know you don't know if there's
animals down there buddy there could be
snakes there could be all kinds of
things down there you don't know this is
amazing it's all uphill from here yeah I
climbed all the way from down there
oh my cheeks are pink I'm breathing okay
time to keep going what do you think of
Bryce Canyon that was seriously the best
hike I've ever been on really and we
just came from Yellowstone and Grand
Teton and those are awesome like the
sights they're awesome
right as far as hikes go this is the
best hug I've ever been on
that's amazing it was like hard enough
to be challenging but it wasn't bad yeah
very good you did everybody beat mommy
mommy was definitely the slowest but I'm
okay with that I'm cool with that
I can deal with that okay so the kids
are getting a little restless because
we're in the car and we did not give
them their media so they're all like
yeah we are not sure exactly what we're
going to be doing tonight we are going
to be either we're gonna try to camp
somewhere but the chances of us getting
a campground on a what is it Friday
Friday to Friday night it's late on a
Friday night we're gonna try that's our
ideal but worst case is will we've found
some hotels that look like they have
vacancies so but we'd rather not do that
because we're talking the difference
we'd $15 and $150 so we're really hoping
that we can we can camp so we'll check
in let you know and my friend based on
the delighting here you can tell oh my
gosh that's bright it's myself only you
can tell we did get a campsite we are in
like a little rinky-dink tiny little
campground where all they the campsites
are all kind of squished together and
there's no table the fire pits like
really junky looking like it's just not
a great campsite but we're only staying
for a night but it was 35 bucks and it's
like compared to like the nicer
campgrounds I stayed in where it was
cheaper than that it's kind of like
really
but the thing good thing is though is
we're at Zion we're not that far we
decided after we talked to a bunch of
people on the hike because you know we
strike up conversations with people that
then we did want to try Zion after all
there's a hike that we want to do that I
can't think of it what it's called right
now but it goes through some water so
we're gonna go ahead and do that
tomorrow we were a little scared because
of the kids we thought that it was gonna
be too hard for them and it was gonna be
dangerous but people assured us that it
was gonna be okay there were a lot of
kids today yesterday yesterday that that
were the same size as my kids and they
were having fun and you know it's hot
out and you get to swim in the water and
everything so we decided to do Zion
so we're gonna do Sion and then we
decided we're gonna cut out Colorado
Springs which breaks my heart because I
wanted to see my friend flora really
really really really really bad but it's
gonna take us about seven extra hours to
get to Colorado Springs and we'd only
get to spend one day there so we decided
to make the executive decision to spend
an extra day in this area instead of
going to Colorado Springs but oh but a
cut it cuts out seven hours of driving
and I you know I really want to meet
Florrie but make my family drive an
extra seven hours I just couldn't do it
so but yeah so so far we had a really
really really good day today at on Bryce
Canyon we had so much fun so looking
forward to another fun day tomorrow and
this vlog is over I'll see you tomorrow
bye love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
