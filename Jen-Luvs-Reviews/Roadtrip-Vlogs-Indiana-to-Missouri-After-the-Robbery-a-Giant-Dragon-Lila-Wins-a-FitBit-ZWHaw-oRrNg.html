vlog Oh
so alright so my friend my peril of Ross
Angela and her husband have been so kind
to us and helped us find a hotel and now
we've slept in the hotel we have called
the insurance company we're still not
sure if our electronics are going to be
covered by insurance we waiting for a
call for that today as far as the window
goes we were gonna get it fixed here
excuse me kids in the background let me
go in here a little bit loud so so we're
not sure if the insurance is gonna cover
it yet we're waiting for that phone call
and then we're gonna actually drive to
st. Louis today to get the window fixed
so that we can kind of get on the road
because we couldn't get a fast
appointment here so we have a four
o'clock appointment in st. Louis so it
will drive four hours to st. Louis and
then get the window fixed there and then
we're planning on driving again so it
looks like the Kansas City meetup is
gonna not happen and it makes me really
sad because there are a lot of people
that I was looking forward to meeting in
Kansas City you know people say hey you
know I can meet either they can sitting
me up and it's like now I'm not gonna
get to meet those people and it's just
it really makes me upset you know that
I'm gonna miss out on that we have to
keep moving or else we're not going to
get to some of the destinations that we
want to get to in a time we're gonna
have to we're gonna run out of time so
so yeah so we just have to keep moving
we'll probably make this vlog be a
couple of days I don't think much
exciting is gonna happen this we're
gonna mostly be just driving today so
without any media for the children that
you're taking it back old school we're
gonna play a lot of road games today so
this this a thing that's gonna be
happening a lot Oh wish me luck
by Indiana
Vienna by person in Indiana that has all
of our electronics
and this is the thing to his that people
in the community are talking about that
it might have been a community member
who stolen because it wouldn't have been
difficult for them to find our car
considering I didn't vlog it's and I
said I was going to be in a certain
location so it's definitely possible
some of the community in it which I'm
hoping is not true cuz our community is
pretty awesome of course that would be
terrible
but there is another a few other options
there right when we got our quarry
broken into across the parking lot the
Saks Fifth Avenue was robbed at the
exact same time almost they saw thirty
five thousand dollars worth of Louis
Vuitton merchandise so it's possible
that either they did it or that somebody
saw all the police officers at the Saks
Fifth Avenue
and they knew that they wouldn't be
caught because the police officers were
all busy and sacks so maybe they took
the opportunity to steal stuff from a
car show that's possible - there's an
investigation now right now the police
department is doing an investigation I
mean we don't really know
whether they'll find anything we hope
they do we hope the persons caught so
they can have proper consequences for
being complete
yeah we hope if they're caught but you
know we're talking about how in order
for someone to be at that place in their
lives to be that cruddy they have to
have had really horrible things happen
to them to make them such a terrible
person so chances are they do not have a
happy life they're not happy people and
be happy life and we're all happy people
so I'll take my life over there's any
day you know I still feel like I have
the one up there you know
we're driving to get the window fixed
we'll be there in when
and now two and a half hours
about two and a half hours to get the
window fixed and then we'll we're
probably just gonna keep on driving get
as far as we can tonight so check it
again later
sorry
stop little fun stop off on the way we
found this guy on road trippers and it
says danger dragon breathe fire
we bought a token at the liquor store
good now buy it for $1 dragon fire
brings luck dragon fire brings good luck
make a wish we could definitely use that
so Jon's gonna drop the token in we're
all gonna stand over here take it when
they get a good spot
drop it in the top and then look whoa
there he goes
that was cool what do you think that
needs that's it
that's what he does dragon is that worth
stopping and saying hi to the dragon
yeah well I have what we could go for
some good luck thanks dragon garden much
appreciate it
all right so we are in Alton Illinois
right outside st. Louis Missouri we're
about to get the car window fixed yeah
he got that we went to a sonic which
we've never been to a sonic before and
John got a little uh a little shark toy
Lyla got some glow-in-the-dark tattoos
and John got this little shooting shark
thing so he's like super happy with a
shooting shark thing the kids have been
amazing
without devices it just goes to show
that kids are capable of surviving long
trips without iPads it's definitely
possible
they've you know yeah they've had
they've been they've been having a good
time we've been doing trivia different
trivia games we've been singing I've
been reading them books I have some
books downloaded on my phone in the
reading Junie B Jones so we're we're in
the process of moving on so yes we're
gonna get this car fixed then we're
gonna head back on the road and try to
get to Kansas City tonight
that's the goal say howdy howdy we're at
the target you know we're like we have
an hour to kill so we're at the target
that was all I wanted to show you nice
you look handsome you got that Pikachu
hat man I love my friend we're leaving
target Lyla what did you get that you're
super excited
I got some cereal
I got a cereal box and it sat on the
packaging that you could wear a Fitbit
in there and has a wedding sticker
buried and they might have a wedding
sticker buried in the cereal and there's
thousands of winners no I might get
lucky and get and get a winning sticker
and give the meal to clean my pride can
I get a Fitbit mmm-hmm so she spent
three dollars of her allowance money on
some red berries Special K with red
berries because she believes that in
this box there's a sticker that will win
her 50 anything but maybe she is one
lucky when she opened your cereal box
kind of thing when I was a kid as I told
her I had lots of disappointment so we
will see what happens whether Lyla wins
a Fitbit or not we will we will show you
in just a moment okay lift the bag out
you see any sticker think inside the box
look in the box
okay alright look carefully around there
just kind of flip it upside down it
still could be in it could be hidden in
there oh well it could be hidden should
be a sticker either where you would
think it'll be stickers either way but I
do not see any kind of sticker
she's very optimistic we're about to go
over the Mississippi River that's kind
of cool we've never been out here before
this is super neat very very very cool I
don't even know what that is even is
that it's called a bridge I know but
that's really cool-looking which that's
the bridge we're going over yes Wow and

trip let me just tell you what I
appreciate about this trip
I appreciate it we haven't paid a single
toll hey guess what our windows fixed

actually talk to each other to a
reasonable level but we haven't paid a
single tool and I sure as I'm chomping
on gum and that's not attractive on

apologize for that yeah we're about to
go over the Mississippi River and I'm
gonna show you because I'm gonna take
you with me when I predict we're in our
theory
