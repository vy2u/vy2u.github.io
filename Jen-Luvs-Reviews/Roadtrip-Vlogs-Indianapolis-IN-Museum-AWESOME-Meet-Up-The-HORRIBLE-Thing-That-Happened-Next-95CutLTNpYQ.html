are we on three I'm gonna lose track at
some point of what day we're on hi Lila
good morning Oh No thank you is that the
tea that daddy made you are you enjoying
it I guess John doesn't like tea we are
supposed to be driving to a Missouri
today but I don't know how far we're
gonna make it because we're already kind
of off to a late start I was up super
late filming and my husband was kind
enough to let me sleep in a little bit
but now like because it takes me so long
to get ready now we're running a little
bit late so what is it about 10 o'clock
a little after 10:00 what after 10 10 20
my I've got my makeup on I wanted to
show you what I put on my face today I
am so let me get into the light
I am so excited about this Laura Lee
palette that sahaja let me borrow oh my
gosh I am like loving it oh well one
thing I noticed about it is that these
shimmery shades the ones that are like
like tickled pink and hissy fit I use
this tea fit today all over my lid and
then use tickled pink in the inner
corner they worked so much better with
fingers than a brush the brush just
doesn't pick it up right so if you don't
like that he wouldn't like it but I am
so loving it and last night before I
went to bed my eyeshadow still looked
perfect
like I'm also really liking the
highlighter palette that she let me
borrow too I only used the one on the
left last night that very bright one I
don't want to take it back out because
we were trying to hurry up and out of
here but the lightest one is the one
that I used and I need to check it for
lasting power today so I'm excited about
that the eyeliner the Revlon eyeliner
that I was using smudged really bad last
night so I wanted it to stay so I used
my Marc Jacobs so that it would stay on
my lips I have Oh Fras Ares and I know
it's the lighting is really bad maybe I
can throw in the shower and it looks
better a little bit better I'm still
really yellow though see so today we're
gonna do the children's music
and Indianapolis and then we're doing
the Indianapolis meetup at the Fashion
Mall and a bunch of people said that
they're coming I don't know how many
people are gonna be there because it's
like super late notice you have to
decide whether we're gonna do a Kansas
City meetup we'll have to see as far as
the timing goes um you know because now
it's gonna be a workday more people are
gonna be able to come unless it's in the
evening so I don't know I really want to
do meetups in the evening but you know I
don't know we'll have to see what

said why are you being such slow pokes
that's not a those aren't real bones
that's a cast so they took real bones
and they made that they make well no
they made that it says it's a cast so
it's a mould almost like play-doh
they take the real thing and they make a
mold of it and then they put fake
material in so that it looks exactly the
same as the real thing
