not using the Polish joy stuff is making
a huge difference today we are headed
down to jenny lake which is in Grand
Teton and we're gonna kind of hop around
there a little bit and then after lunch
we're going to head to where we go baby
we're going to Jackson that's right
we're going to Jackson what are we doing
in Jackson Wyoming and that's like about
60 miles away and it's like the closest
town to where we're at so we're gonna go
there I heard it's really neat place
what are we doing that it's cool shops
and stores so we'll probably check that
out maybe have like a early dinner and
then fourth of July fireworks yes and
I've got my fourth of July shirts on
underneath this I'm wearing this looks
I'm wearing the same shirt two days in a
row but it's cold here I was not
expecting it to be so cold I don't think
we anticipated the crazy weather oh my
gosh it's different from back home yes
and we were expecting different but we
didn't know what to expect yeah so I
mean it gets back did it before yeah we
did we did expect it to be warmer um we
drive we packed like shorts and t-shirts
and like one warm shirt like thinking
you know it's the middle of summer duh
so so we we've been kind of recycling
our sweatshirts a lot because it's like
it gets really warm like feels like like
75 80 degrees and then it'll get like
freezing cold where it'll feel like it's
like 55-60 and we'll just kind of go
back and forth cuz it'll like rain and
then i'll be super sunny and then it'll
rain and it'll be super sunny and then
it'll be windy and it'll be rainy it's
like the weirdest weirdest weather and
it like is constantly flip flopping all
through the day it's very strange so I
have been editing vlogs I'm
the day 6 vlog right now we haven't had
internet connection for how many days
what did we come from it would have been
day sick since we got into Wyoming well
day 6 we stayed yeah yeah so we have it
so that's why there hasn't been any
what's have been makeup that's why there
hasn't been any uploads we got internet
connection for how long yesterday like
30 minutes of the long because we're
junkies so like we're updating our
instagrams and I got on periscope for
like 20 seconds something like that it
wasn't very long with definitely less
than a minute I got to say hi to people
real quick I got the text Tabitha my
production manager for what's been
makeup got to check in with her got to
check in with ami or Nina go I mean I
take 10 minutes just to set one photo to
somebody over text message yeah so if
you're wondering why there's no content
is because I cannot get any kind of
signal I really really wanted to so
you're gonna see this like way after the
date so we're driving towards the south
entrance of Yellowstone and what you see
in front of us is part of Grand Teton
National
many ranges very cool all right so we
will see you again at G anyway alright
so a little change of plans we
accidentally turn the wrong direction to
go to jenny lake so it looks like we're
going straight to jackson but i wanted
to show you there's grand teton the
biggest mountain over there is Grand
Teton and then if you look out there you
can see there's a bunch of Buffalo you
can see them hopefully it'll focus there
we go see there's a bunch of Buffalo out
there there's a buffalo behind us too
but they're even smaller looking but
yeah so grand teton lots of buffalo
super cool so I'll tell you a little
Buffalo story I used to teach the story
when I was teaching 4th grade so buffalo
or bison American bison almost became
extinct there the American settlers not
American but the the white settlers came
and they wanted to get rid of the Native
Americans they wanted to take over the
land so they decided they were going to
kill the Buffalo fed on there were these
long tall grasses they can't they they
dug up all the grasses and they killed
the Buffalo which hurt the Native
American population of course and a lot
of Native Americans died so what ended
up happening was because they they
killed all of the grasses they ended up
creating a big dust storm because
they're everything they plan to die
because it couldn't the roots couldn't
get down the white settlers had to leave
because they couldn't get their crops to
grow in the area and they thought that
all the buffalo were extinct well teddy
roosevelt became president and he made
it illegal to hunt american bison so
they he sent out scouts to find bison to
see if he could find any and eventually
a scout did find a very small herd of
bison and that every single bison the
American bison that exists is a
descendant of those bison before you can
fyodor Rosabelle yeah Teddy Roosevelt
Theodore Roosevelt's the same guy thank
you very much for clarifying just in
case anybody didn't know so so he has a
Theodore Roosevelt actually it's because
of him that these bison even exist
so it's kind of cool that they were all
descended from that one little patch of
buffalo or bison that those Native
Americans I believe they were Native
Americans saved so it was very small
group so that's kind of cool and there's
some babies out there you see they're
red and that was part of the story was
that the the babies were red feel like a
packet boat welcome to Jackson Hole
Wyoming so we're all up fourth of July
