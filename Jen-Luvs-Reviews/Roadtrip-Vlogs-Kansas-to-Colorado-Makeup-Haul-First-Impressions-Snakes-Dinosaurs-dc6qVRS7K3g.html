in Hays Kansas right now we are on our
way to Colorado we haven't decided a
hundred percent and we haven't decided
exactly where we want to go in Colorado
we've lost some time because of the
theft and having to spend a little extra
time in Indianapolis so now we're we're
not we're not 100% sure what we're going
to be doing so that's something that
we're gonna figure out in the next
couple of hours
we are going to a museum what we are
going to the Museum of Natural History
here and we're pretty excited about that
we also have a stop-off a roadside
attraction at one of the world's fastest
carousels supposedly it goes 12 miles an
hour and most carousels only go 8 so
we're going to be doing that
and then we had breakfast this morning
at a hotel we're at a Holiday Inn
Express John what happened with the
pancakes now when you push a button
there's pin pick go get that plop down
and one and it and it rolls out when it
rolls and rolls and rolls until it comes
out from machine and you put a plate on
there it went down and then it locks
onto your plate and also this morning
John snows milk on himself and he was
drinking it and you admit it anyway
don't ask why I have milk spilled all
over me so we had fun at the hotel
breakfast this morning I was sad that I
didn't have you with me at the hotel
breakfast did you want to say something
and John's doing some some work to try
to recover our stuff and with insurance
stuff so I had a chance to do my makeup
so just want to show you quickly what I
did this is how the makeup turned out
today and I use mostly products that I
bought yesterday at the Kansas City
Meetup
so let me show you what I used I know
it's yellow in here it's how
it's hotel bathroom that's what happens
so I used the Mac Mac Paint Pot in
vintage selection I put that all over my
lids I know you can't see oh my gosh I
would that all over my lids but you saw
second ago so put that all over my lids
and then the shadow that I put over top
of that is the laura mercier shadow in
african violet and Sarah that was at the
meet up she had showed me a palette by
Laura Marcia that she really really
loves and I said oh my gosh that's like
the shade I need and they happen to have
it in a single so it's really really
excited about that I hate that you guys
can't see let me bring it out here okay
so there's African violet isn't that
gorgeous
let me see if I can it's just a gorgeous
purple so I'll put that over top of the
Paint Pot there's like a brownish shade
in the middle for the blush that's what
I have up in my crease and open the
Cruze and then I have the blush over on
the left-hand side well yeah the one
over on the left that one is called Roe
spritz I believe and then the the
champagne pop on the tops of my cheeks
so and oh and Pasadena on my lips by
Oprah I use a Marc Jacobs pencil liner
on my upper lash line i always use
liquid eyeliner but i want to try
something different so I use that
remarkable I think it's remarkable the
little pencil so we'll see how that
lasted the day but this is natural light
and I feel like that looks pretty
accurate to what I'm seeing here so that
is how the makeup look came out and I
will see you guys over at the Museum so
this is the Sternberg Museum of Natural
History we're going to go ahead and go
in there and as part of the be Fort Hays
State University John
no that's cool while doing a scavenger
hunt these big turtles they're cool John
what's in this what's in this critic age
here Oh rat snake
oh he's scary at night see that he is
not happy right now
he wants this right Lila won't you
speaks in Parseltongue at him John tries
to be partial talking at the snake yeah
this is really cool so they've got
different kinds that one's really that
is this one has it has a lot of
different the other side too
they're all different cages yeah and
then it tells you how much venom each
snake has and then how much toxicity
yeah it has for each whole supernate
these are creatures from 80 million
years ago let me see if you can see them
he's super dark in here it's really dark
there you go
good job thank you lighting man you know
this body
we're important warning sign you have to
stay on the path to follow directions
this is so cool
this is really cool
senator Diplodocus over there I think
that's a Diplodocus
hey hey you're just jealous of my
dinosaur knowledge every nice thing is
huge
viola what'd you just say
so we could come and touch time in our
backyard
oh my goodness I was so scary
ah that was scary you guys have fun
John did you have fun yeah what was your
favorite part everything everything
Lila what was your favorite part like
eating a leaf yeah that that Stood Still
and then it started moving its heading
and yeah I was crazy wasn't it daddy
what was your favorite part my life I'm
gonna try like t-rex that was pretty rad
it was pretty rad I liked that I got to
see lots of dinosaur fossils cuz those
are my favorites so I got to see a
pliosaurus for the first time and I
thought that was incredible so we are on
our way on the road toward Colorado we
are going to try to make it to the
carousel there's a carousel stop off
that we're hoping to be able to make
before it closes it's getting kind of
late it's about 2 o'clock and it closes
at 6 so we're hoping we can make it
there and we're gonna grab some food out
of the trunk
part of our stock of food and try to
make it so I'll see in a minute and let
you know whether we made it or not by
Kansas welcome to Cal
so we've made a change of plans
and my battery is dying on my camera we
have to find a battery for my camera
that we no more vlogs so I'm really
nervous about that but yeah there's a
change of plans
Oh windmills those things are cool okay
anyway so instead of going to Colorado
Springs now we're gonna save Colorado
Springs until after Arizona when we're
on our way back it'll take us about
three hours out of the way but we really
really really want to get to Yellowstone
and Grand Teton earlier rather than
later so we make sure we get there
before the fourth of July rush it is
today is the 29th so that means we would
get there tomorrow afternoon on the 30th
which is much better for 4th of July
than getting there on the first or the
second so yeah so that's the new plan
you know changing things up a little bit
we got to keep things exciting so
because I only have 13 percent battery
I'm only gonna bring you back and
there's something like super excite so
we'll see it going over some weird stuff
here all right so that's the plan we're
gonna be drivin all night we'll stop
somewhere in Wyoming to get a hotel room
we really wanted a camp tonight but
there's gonna be ton of camping in our
future so we're super excited about
made it to the carousel it is the kit
County Kit Carson County carousel
national historic land mark I'll show
you what it looks like here in
Burlington Colorado Burlington Colorado
that's right so this these are all wood
horses and other animals and I'm not
sure when this was built but it was
definitely before the 1930s 1905 1905 so
really really cool
nice little stop off John's excited what
do you guys think you're gonna ride
maybe the zebra there you go
sounds good you guys excited so these
were all hand-carved animals and that
cool so neat
going really fast now whoo one of the
fastest carousels in the United States
it goes 12 miles an hour
oh my goodness they're going so fast I'm
so glad I am NOT on this ride I am such
a wimp so this is going to be the end of
the day six vlog I'm my camera battery's
about died two five four seven we have
to somehow find a battery for my
vlogging camera because my battery my
backup battery was stolen along with the
charger so this is going to be the end
