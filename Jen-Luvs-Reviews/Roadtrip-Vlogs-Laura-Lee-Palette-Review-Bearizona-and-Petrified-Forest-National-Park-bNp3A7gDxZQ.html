printed shower curtain I am at the
Highlander motel on route 66 and if you
don't know route 66 google it listen to
the song there's all these offbeat
attractions and it's just a very
interesting place to be so we decided
the kids are giggling the background we
decided we were going to stay at this
little motel it was built in nineteen
fifty and it's a cutest little place
it's a very very small room we've got a
lot of character here this is very soft
by the way just so you know but I did
just finally get to put some makeup on
so I'm gonna go ahead and show you what
I used i'm going to show you right now
what it looks like but then i have to go
in the other room hi babes oh did you
bring me some coffee as long as coffee
experience I've ever had oh my goodness
so i'm going to show you my makeup right
now so you can see it and then i'm going
to show you what i use because it's all
yellow in there and there's nowhere to
set anything down in here where there's
a little bit of natural light coming
from this window so bring you into the
yellow color over here and kind of show
you what i use so for lips because
someone commented on a video recently i
didn't show you what i put on my lips i
use charmed by oprah this part of the
man emu a collection and i really really
really love it I love Oprah liquid
lipsticks a lot love them a lot once
again browse with the brow cabrillo by
benefit still really loving that so all
over the lid I used Eden which means
that discoloration on Urban Decay's Eden
and then I use this Laura Mercier
african violet shadow I have to come
over into the light here so you can see
the shadow that's what I have all over
my lid I feel like it didn't transfer
quite as well as I had hoped all over
the lid like to the point where you can
see the duochrome pneus I guess the
duochrome is relatively subtle but I
don't know I just don't feel like it's
quite as poppin so I used a little bit
um I tapped it on with my fingers just
to make sure I had the maximum opacity
and that's how it came out and then he
use just a little bit of my violet Voss
lauralee palette now I've been hearing
I've watched a couple of videos now
since I um since I got to laura-leigh
palette when you guys saw my other
reviews of the Loire Aleppo I hadn't
watched any other videos and now I've
watched some videos from people I trust
and people complaining about this
palette and I'm honestly shocked and
even though there's people that I trust
that are saying and I quote the mats
suck I don't think the mats up I really
don't I've been using first pot and mama
bird a lot and I do really like them
I've really been enjoying those I feel
like basic that white one over the first
one in the top row is a little bit weak
compared to other Matt creams that I
have that are awesome but I do agree
that the shimmery shades are definitely
the highlight in this palette I haven't
used a lot of the lower ones I guess
maybe it's my skin tone maybe it's my
skin type but for me personally I've
really been loving this palette for
today all I used was a little bit of
basic in the inner corner and then I use
this bubs which is the third one on the
bottom row right here I use that on the
lower lash line from here to here and
then i use tickled pink to go pink yes
tickled pink which is the second one in
the second row I know I saying all these
numbers the second one in the second row
is tickled pink I used that all across
the lash line and then I brightened up
the inner corner with it and I really
like the way my eyeshadow look came out
I decided not to deepen up the outer
corner just left it alone from the
Jacqueline help out I use that Center
blush shade it's kind of like a bronzer
you can see that and then i use 04
highlight i use the the whiter highlight
so that one is called Prosecco pomp and
then the one in the middle is called
amaretto yay jump down my sleep
headphones what were they John finds
everything she loses everything and I
find everything that's true we're just
yeah that's fine oh I could totally go I
can't accept that go with that this
blonde is just popping today it's just
falling so today for our plans we are
going to a place called beres ona
and it's a kind of a controlled bear and
wildlife population and what they do is
they give them a very large free space
to roam and then you drive down the path
and you keep your windows up and you
stay safe in your car and then they do
feed the animals so it's kind of like a
zoo in that way and that they feed the
animals but they have a very large space
so it's different than a zoo in that way
so we are going to be driving through
their zona and then we have a very long
long drive to Amarillo Texas which is
supposed to be our next stop I think
it's about nine hours from here oh so we
will catch up with you at berra zona

gate yeah true story Oh sell it is
another hour if we keep going I know and
this is the thing is like I think we're
not going to make it as far as we
thought we were going to today we spent
a long time in Barrow zona so I think
that's part of the problem is we spend
too much time Arizona all right thank

make it we are all the way you think
we're gonna make it all the way to Texas
we're not going to New Orleans tonight
crazy
crazy crazy we just hit the New Mexico
line who's trying to go all the way New
Orleans Louisiana all the way across
Texas ESA's we can make it you're
driving I guess I'm sleeping in the car

New Mexico looks kind of pretty it's
very gradient looks like a wonderful
gradient nail manicure dunnet like the
kind you do with sponges that never come
out right except for four people on
Instagram can we have a moment of
silence
