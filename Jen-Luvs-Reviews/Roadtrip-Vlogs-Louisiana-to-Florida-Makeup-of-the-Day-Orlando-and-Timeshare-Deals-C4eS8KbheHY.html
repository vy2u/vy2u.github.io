to orlando I'm so excited I'm very
excited to drive to orlando I don't know
what John's call ma um but uh but you
have excited because this is kind of the
part that I've really been looking
forward to I was looking forward to a
lot of things but this is kind of like
my big thing is going to orlando so
before we go let me show you what I use
on my face today because i can put on
makeup now I used all over my lid Urban
Decay's fireball and I started putting
it away and I was like no I think I want
to swatch this for you guys it's got
this duochrome this to it it's like a
pink with an orange shift to it I don't
know if that how much that transfers to
the lids but I do really like it we'll
see how long it lasts I just don't feel
like it transfers the way that hi baby
how are you ok good your shorts look
good they're living they look fine I
can't ok good good I just don't feel
like the duochrome transfers as well as
I hope that it would but then I had to I
wanted to use the palette that my friend
Nicole from yay or nay Nicole gave me
it's a tory burch palette that she
picked up for me but I'm learning if
this is more of a supplemental palette
rather than oh that's me and you hello
there we are hello me and you it's more
of a supplemental palette because
there's no brow bone shade and it's just
you know it's one of those that you use
along with other shot of the other
palettes so I use that shape following
that brownish kind of shade it's the
first one in the second row I use that
all up in crazy and then I use a little
bit of blushing which is the bottom row
the first one I used a little bit of
that in the inner corner but it didn't
really show up too well so I had to
break into the Loreley palette cuz you
know I only brought so many things and I
used basic as my brow bone shade which
it worked pretty well today with that
shadow I was very actually very happy
with it and then I use a loo which is
the black down in the bottom right
corner I use that to deepen up the outer
corner just a
bit and then blend it very nicely I was
pretty happy with it we'll see how long
it lasts today I did use all of that
over top of my next pencil and milk that
was the base that I used it's good at
least to hear them laughing on my cheeks
I used the jaclyn hill palette i just
used for blush today i just use the one
in the top left corner which is called
rose spritz that's what i have on my
cheeks and then i use the cash box
contour palette just a little bit down
yonder for lips today i feel like i
don't know i'm not sure if i like my
lips a whole lot it's a combination of
oprah's aries along with where the other
one go along with bare minerals the new
matte formula in help because i felt
like the aries was a little too bright
for what I was going for so this that
have kind of calmed it down a little bit
and that's pretty much it for what I
have on my face hi hey are you excited
to go to orlando today as usual actually
doing everything and stuff yeah today
we're just gonna kind of walk around a
little bit so we have about a four and a
half hour drive which is not a bad drive
for us considering what we've been
driving in a day so we'll get there well
before dinner which will be great very
very excited event tomorrow we're going
to universal studios Miami yeah we're
gonna Lila and I are gonna do Harry
Potter stuff and then John and John are
gonna break off and do some superhero
stuff so um so I will see you guys in a
little bit like you married my toes in a
way of your blog for my cup there we
rest up hold on a minute daddy's coming

tickets to go to a 90 minute
presentation where they give you
breakfast and make you listen to their
spiel and I try to sell you the
timeshare they're like no thanks peace

just remember when I was a kid my
parents and I went to something like
this and they said they were going to
give us a diamond bracelet and the
diamond bracelet ended up getting all
rusty and like it was like super fake
and like they say they're gonna give us
all this stuff and all ended up being
fake I'm not going for a diamond
bracelet anyway so hopefully everything
works out okay but it seemed like a
really cool place so we'll cross our
fingers everything works out all right
