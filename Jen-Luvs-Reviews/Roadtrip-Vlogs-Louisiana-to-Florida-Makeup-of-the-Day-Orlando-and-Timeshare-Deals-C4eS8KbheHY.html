to Orlando I'm so excited I'm very
excited to drive to Orlando I don't know
what John's Gollum ah but uh but you
have excited because this is kind of the
part that I've really been looking
forward to I was looking forward to a
lot of things but this is kind of like
my big thing is going to Orlando so
before we go let me show you what I use
on my face today because I can put on
makeup no I used all over my lid Urban
Decay's fireball and I started putting
it away and I was like no I think I want
to swatch this for you guys it's got
this duochrome and this to it it's like
a pink with an orange shift to it I
don't know effect how much that
transfers to the lids but I do really
like it we'll see how long it lasts I
just don't feel like it transfers the
way that hi baby how are you okay good
your shorts look good they're lame they
look fine I can't okay good good I just
don't feel like the duochrome
transfers as well as I hoped that it
would but then I had to I wanted to use
the talent that my friend Nicole from
Rene Nicole gave me it's a Tory Burch
palette that she picked up for me but
I'm learning if this is more of a
supplemental palette rather than oh
that's me and you hello there we are
hello me and you it's more of a
supplemental palette because there's no
brow bone shade and it's just you know
it's one of those that you use along
with other shot other other palettes so
I use that shade falling that brownish
kind of shade it's the first one in the
second row I use that all up in and then
I used a little bit of blushing which is
the bottom row the first one I used a
little bit of that in the inner corner
but it didn't really show up too well so
I had to break into the Laura Lee
palette cuz you know I only brought so
many things and I used basic as my brow
bone shade which it worked pretty well
today with that shadow I was very
actually very happy with it and then I
used a loo which is the black down in
the bottom right corner I use that to
deepen up the outer corner just a
but and it blended very nicely I was
pretty happy with it we'll see how long
it lasts today I did use all of that
over top of my next pencil and milk that
was the base that I used it's good at
least to hear them laughing on my cheeks
I used the Jaclyn hill palette I just
used for blush today I just used the one
in the top left corner which is called
rose spritz that's what I have on my
cheeks and then I use the cash box
contour palette just a little bit Down
Yonder for lips today I feel like I
don't know I'm not sure if I like my
lips a whole lot it's a combination of
Oprah's Aries along with where the other
one go along with bare minerals the new
matte formula in hemp because I felt
like the Aries was a little too bright
for what I was going for so this that
have kind of calmed it down a little bit
and that's pretty much it for what I
have on my face
hi Hey are you excited to go to Orlando
today actually doing your thinking and
stuff yeah today we're just gonna kind
of walk around a little bit so we have
about a four and a half hour drive which
is not a bad drive for us considering
what we've been driving in a day so
we'll get there well before dinner which
will be great very very excited event
tomorrow we're going to Universal
Studios Miami yeah we're gonna Lyla and
I are gonna do Harry Potter stuff and
then John and John are gonna break off
and do some superhero stuff so so I will
see you guys in a leg up there we rest
up oh not a minute daddy's coming go
back up like a hammock at this official
Florida Welcome Center super official
place and we got possibly shake tickets
shady oh no miss cut the guy was really
nervous as he was checking us out did
you notice that we got a
sure we got a bouncer wasn't nervous and
he seemed really nervous because I'm
intimidating
anyway so we got these we got two
tickets - we got tickets to Chi parks we
got tickets to both of the Universal
Studios parks and a hotel at I forgot
where the hotel is but some hotel and
then we got and it was super cheap
because we have to watch like a
timeshare presentation thing this is
where it makes me nervous
I don't forward I know we've done this
three tickets to go to a 90 minute
presentation where they give you
breakfast and make you listen to their
spiel and they try to sell you the
timeshare they're like no thanks peace
out and yeah the park for that so yeah I
just remember when I was a kid my
parents and I went to something like
this and they said they were gonna give
us a diamond bracelet and the diamond
bracelet ended up getting all rusty and
like it was like super fake and like
they said they're gonna give us all this
stuff and all ended up being fake I'm
not going for a diamond bracelet anyway
so hopefully everything works out okay
but it seemed like a really cool place
so we'll cross our fingers everything
works out all right and see you in a bit
right
looks like man got a told finally got
tolls kids are listening to music in the
background so hopefully I don't get a
copyright strike on this one we are here
