vlog we are still in Yellowstone today

are headed to Mammoth Hot Springs we
don't really know what's there but we're
excited to go because we want to explore
we do want to explore that's very true
on and we wouldn't show athlete and we
wouldn't have gone there we knew what
was there yeah and it wouldn't be just
boring that's a good point yeah that's a
really good point so we have been on the
road for almost two weeks can you guys
believe it yeah yeah does it feel like
living on she weeks Lila kind of John
does it feel like a bleeping gone almost
two weeks yeah it seems like we have
been gone a while I think I missed the
most of the internet and our dog I kind
of miss our dog yeah yeah we miss our
dog yeah it's really fun we're having a
great time we've done a lot in 12 days
he does he tries to ride a dog so so
we've done a lot in 12 days if you
haven't seen the previous vlogs a lot of
things have been happening and it's been
fun we're headed to the hot springs it's
about a two-hour drive right from here
maybe hour and a half its but it's kind
of late we got off to a late start we
slept inks we were up late last night
for the fireworks oh it's about quarter
after eleven and we won't get there
until close to one o'clock
but we're excited to see what's there
and we're going to take you with us and
we're going to explore together we got
to Mammoth Hot Springs and it's very
bougie married tourists very its pack of
people and then you've got random help
just grazing on the lawn there's a hotel
like what Michaels about it's okay well
then it's cool she's just got a foot
look she's got it Wow yeah thinking that
those animals are paid actors they maybe
they're paid actors those aren't real
animals sailor it's not real so mammoth
hot springs hotel and cabins cabins are
like probably have electricity and stuff
and they won be eating grass dining room
we have the terrace grill up here like
what's so this isn't oh they can see up
here in the north end of the park
apparently oh no look at us being all
judgey judgey I know everybody knows
like French khakis on and stuff
too it's a lot of press khakis around I
mean there's nowhere to park around here
it's nowhere to park and it's like I
don't know about this place so we'll
find someplace to park we saw been eaten
lunch it's 222 we haven't eaten lunch
yet so we need to park and somehow we
lunch huh there's no kid there's no
picnic tables we saw one picnic table
that was being used by some play another
family and that's pretty much all we've
seen as far as picnic tables there's
just a restaurant I think so I think
I've you have to walk up to the top
hopefully we can find a spot one of
these little places and we go up there
yeah hopefully
no just uh it's very different from what
we've seen so it's just here we weren't
expecting it so we're gonna go ahead and
park so this is pretty cool smells like
rotten eggs though but it's cool-looking
is stinky what is that dang it says
Devil's Thumb yep creepy really cool
looking though really cool this makes
the trip worth it i think you know what
the good news is Lila can save good news
fart no be able to know the difference
because it'll smell just like this place
it's pallet spring so maybe we could
make an eyeshadow palette for pallet
spring this would be an awesome
eyeshadow palette you think about it
like thinking about these colors orange
and greens and the grays and tokes we
got some topes got some rust browns that
would be amazing eyeshadow palette see
they thought of that already yes best
warning sign for children ever because
any child will understand that he's wise
feet are you better get off that quick
Sydney you got to make sure you know you
don't step off for that could happen to
you right it's really important you
gotta written lots of languages talking
about this black ran over here that
looks like it's safe what it's not
hi

what sweetie there's a bird just walking
through it like it's no big deal just
take a little bath that's amazing pretty
crazy man is it recording up pretty
crazy man if you can see the steam like
rising over there and it feels hot over
here like really hot and it's just
really cool looking like it's amazing
that nature made this round then on this
question yeah
so we are all the way up at the top and
this is the main terrace we just climbed
about a billion steps to get up here
that's what it looks like there you go
pretty cool all right this is kind of a
crazy shot so many different landscapes
uh-huh that pole over there straight
ahead is really cool looking we'll have
to get a little closer to that one it's
like a little home for little elves or

fire tonight and we're gonna do story
time tonight so we'll see in a minute hi
advil pouch looks like it's actually
really good so this is a different brand
this is called good to go real food
really their master well done Thanks
looking good looking good yeah John's in
charge of putting the chairs out Lyle is
in charge of laying in the hammock okay
so let's put put them over here like we
did last night
every time I went to go grab a log from
the side of the road it looked like it
was perfect size and then I would get
over there and it was huge yeah so then
we started looking for wood that looked
too small from the car would make me
nervous on don't get so close to the
fire yeah sorry i was getting nervous i
don't mean to cut you off babe don't you
know the Johnny Cash fell into a burning
ring of fire he went down down down and
the flames got new life upon tyne
there's a girl named Jenny she had very
dark black hair PT and Jenny used to
walk to school every day but she had a
problem because she had no legs and he
was really mad and in upset people
because they chopped off her legs after
she couldn't walk very far anymore
because her legs were talking tough he
had to ride this stupid smelly bus to
school oh he started riding the bus and
she met a boy named Thomas Jenny and
Thomas devised a plan to get back at the
people who chopped her legs off and then
and then they played it and then and
then their play and then they're gonna
play a prank on you got to tell us what
the prank was mommy Darren plan was to
was to take was when they found them to
call the police and have them put in a
jam hmm good for them but the people
found out about their plan and found
them first the Thomas was prepared and
he had created a machine to get back at
them for what they did to Jenny and and
it was to destroy anyone and it would
call the cops right by it themselves and
it girl and by itself and it goes faster
than a speed of lightning what their
problem was that Thomas has had it had
it tested out the machine and it didn't
work so the people who had originally
chopped off Jenny's legs chopped off
both of their arms that's terrible I
just sound like the metallica video
Mitaka video what was it was it I cannot
see I get out of here I'm gonna rock I
can attack this is terrible this is a
wonderful story right can we do another
story yeah this has gotten taken a dark
turn just too much okay once upon a time
there was a grizzly bear named Frank huh
Frank oh yeah had a best friend was a
rabbit named Bob and he loved Bob
because they were best friends and every
day they would invent machines that that
would be super cool and you think good
for them and I meant in vending machine
that would that would make that would
make everybody go to jail if they were
being too crooked and they seem them
mm-hmm delish so the Machine went around
when I went all around the world every
day super fast and whenever it detected
somebody who was being very crooked it
it went it went over to them captured
them called 911 and they went to jail
except there was a glitch in the
software somewhere and for some reason
even though Frank the grizzly bear and
Bob the rabbit were both very good
people one day the Machine grab Bob the
rabbit and put him into jail so Frank
had to come with a plan to save his best
friend so he went to the police station
and he said to the police officer I our
droid accidentally put one person who
wasn't being naughty into the jail cell
he tried to prove it to the to the
police officers not taking him machine
and since the officers had the key to
the jail then they put down that then
this face so then the droid put them
into jail to prove that that the that
Frank was not lying but the problem was
is now even the police who had access to
the keys to the jail were all in jail so
there was nobody to let them out of the
jail except for Frank except for Frank
Frank was still free so Frank had to
come up with a new machine that would
unlock any jail cell not but it would
only unlock his friends because once is
Frankie out you shut the doors on
anybody else who's in there
cool Frank had to program the machine to
recognize any faces of their friends and
let them out of jail but there but they
flirt but she forgot to add the police
officers and he only added his other
friends so all of his innocent friends
got out of jail but the police were
still trapped and there was an
accidental glitch in the new machine and
it led out one of the world's most crazy
supervillains so Bob and Frank decided
to work together with their friends to
take out the supervillain moose man but
thankfully that that that that oh that
that that's super villain loose man
didn't help hours with the good guys
ding good good the reason why he didn't
have his powers was because when the
police put him in jail they took away
all his powers with his with their
powerless machine so when Frank and Bob
found out that the moose man
supervillain had lost his powers they
quickly found him and put him into the
jail but they had to figure out a fix to
get the police out because they needed
the police to make sure to keep order in
their animal town so they they went to
the cage where the Moose man had lost
his powers and they extracted the powers
from the cage in a little vial and gave
them the powers to the police officers
which made them super police officers
and because they were so good
didn't turn them evil they just had
super powers we can and that's the head
and since the the most man could fly
before when he had his superpowers it
made them so they could fly and and then
they flied up and picked the police
officers out of the jail but then the
other people took the supervillain moose
powers haha they all got the
supervillain moose powers and because
they were so good they all got flying
powers yeah oh now they all have flying
powers and now taking pic and that and
then they could pick up the police
officers mm-hmm they got the police
officers out of the jail everything in
and in their animal village was working
fine and Frank and Bob fix their
machines and they never had get jizz
again yeah then they took a vacation and
make some s'mores yeah
