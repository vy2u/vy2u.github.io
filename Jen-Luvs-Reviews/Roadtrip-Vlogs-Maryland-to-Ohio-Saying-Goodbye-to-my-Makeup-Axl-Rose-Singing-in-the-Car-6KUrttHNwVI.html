what are the people in Ohio do it one
thing that I'm really really sad about
is that I have to take my nail polish
off and I have to leave all my colors
behind cuz it's just super hard to
maintain nails on the road so I'm gonna
take my nail polish off I can't imagine
I mean my nails not painted for almost
an entire month like I'm freaking out
about that what you doing daddy yeah
how's the packing going these could be
like that much shorter they would fit
perfectly
oh that's thanks somebody don't oh man
that is a bar that's a big bar what
about these guys over here it's time to
make the last cup of coffee at home so I
have all my K Cups in here and I love
like the flavored kind so this one's
banana foster this is really great brand
crazy cups and we've got decked by
chocolate

one is called hazelnut biscotti I think
that's what we're gonna have there's a
little John John who knew you that's his
little graduation picture from pre-k
so yes and then there's only a little
bit of milk left so that makes me happy
goodbye babies I'm gonna miss you I'm
sad I can't bring my Swan queen bell and
I can't bring my two V's ballot I can't
bring my little black book of bronzers
in my Urban Decay palette I mean this is
hard it's like leaving my children
behind I'm so sad they're laughing at me
what you think it's funny what why do I
sound ridiculous if you have kids do
your kids do this or did you do this
when you were a kid my son has frozen
all of his shopkins and all of his
little toys he freezes them in cups and
takes up like half our freezers do you
think they'll have a rose and food but
like really John really get him on let's
go yeah are you ready Lila you have
everything you excited in order to
combat boredom I got the kids little
road trip presents so they just got the
first things John what you get my
evening
okay
yes what is it what's it called there
you go very good so hopefully that will
keep them busy for at least the first
few hours we have a printout of our road
trip that's our route so that's where
we're going we're starting at number at
the little flag over on the side and
then we're going to number one today
which is Ohio we're going to take about
six and a half hours to drive to Ohio
yes and that's gonna be our day are you
ready ready that's really cool
driving through it look at all the rocks
on the sides
hi babe first lunch on the road oh yes
we brought plenty of food so it's 12:30
we left the house about 10:00 about
quarter to 10:00 and it's 12:30
are we in West Virginia no we're still
in Maryland we haven't even left the
stage the kids are eating what are you
eating what kind of sandwich
PB&amp;amp;J with banana swirl bread nice and
then we've got John and I have these
sandwich and then she meets sandwiches
young so about three and a half hours
left to the destination for today
the road
did you hear about about actual roads
and the means
okay this is what happened so Axl Rose
found some memes online making find that
he was gaining weight and you know what
he did
he contacted Google and anywhere where
he saw them and demanded that they be
removed or else he was going to sue them
oh yes so you stay you stay because you
decided he was going to take this to
such an extreme level that everybody
found out about the beats and they made
even more memes more memes about the
fact that Axl was suing over this debate
offensive ain't meant enough where the
fakeness
the saving of his character deprivation
decimation of his character so it
actually had the opposite effect instead
of them coming down
he actually increased the number of meet
that'll make songs with guitar like this
anymore
not as epic
welcome to Ohio
we know Maya
so we're getting closer and closer we're
getting closer
so finally fill you in on on what in the
world we're doing what this vlog series
is going to be what what what is
happening why we're here as you know if
you are following my channel I typically
do makeup videos and this is our family
road trip makeup videos are still going
to happen they're just not going to be
as much because we're gonna be on this
road trip for the next three weeks so
this all started this idea John came up
to me one night and was like hey let's
go to Colorado this summer I was like
that sounds cool let's do that and he's
like why don't we just drive out there
I'm like drive out there oh yeah I guess
we could drive out there yeah we could
do like a road trip
yeah let's do like a road trip and then
I found a website called road trippers
calm and it's hashtag not sponsored and
found out all these really cool things
to do on our road trip and I was like
well I think we're gonna do this let's
just do it so one night when he wasn't
home I went crazy on road trippers and
just plotted this crazy circular course
to go to Colorado but then to extend it
he said he wanted to go to Yellowstone
and to Zion and to the Grand Canyon and
I was like well if we're gonna do all
that then I want to go to New Orleans
and I want to go to Orlando and take
Lyla to Harry Potter world so it turned
into this craziness of a road trip
and start drying 9,000 miles is it 9,000
no I think I think it's 66 hundred miles
where are you gonna go what are you most
excited about John superhero world we
also known as Universal Studios you guys
see spider-man and ride rides yeah we're
gonna go to Disney to eventually so yeah
I'm gonna take you guys with me I
thought that would be fun be on you know
make sure it's them so putting content
out for you all and I thought it would
be just a different change of pace and I
hope you enjoy the vlogs my road trip
goals is to finish this
this would be the first chapstick that
I've ever finished you know what I find
hilarious getting so close
not only that you've never finished the
chapstick in your life but the shape of
your chapstick there's so much money the
shape of that thing what was even his
dad's that's a crown
Pinchas at between his lips who does
that do you do that I don't do that I
press it down on my lips I go like this
hey man you're cheating that's mine to
finish you finished off a chapstick in
your lifetime I would love to hear about
it in the comments or do you lose it
before you finish it
well buy a new one and some like
find it in your pocket the next season
yep that happens meet my winter coats
yes so we are about a little less than
an hour away from Hocking Hills State
Park which is where we're hoping we camp
we're not sure if we're gonna be able to
get a campsite there if not there's lots
of campsites around then we're gonna try
out so we'll meet up with you in two
seconds which will be an hour for us
hey guys do it you hanging in there all
right so we're having an issue in that I
booked a campground for the first place
in Ohio but I I booked it for before we
were going to like we ended up switching
the date we were leaving and I forgot to
change the reservation taint so now that
place is booked and the KOA by here is
booked so now we're out of third place
trying to see if they have a spot this
one is less fancy like there's no pool
you see the lightsabre behind me John
show me your lightsaber yeah well we
didn't come to go to a pool we can't be
camp right Lyla would have preferred a
pool yes that would have been good but
yeah so John's inside trying to see if
they have a spot that will fit us you
also have another issue no internet
service
that means no periscope no research for
what's up and make up it means that
there were it's not good for the YouTube
channel right now no surface very
nervous about that that I'm not gonna be
able to get this show up for Sunday and
the other thing is is I was gonna try to
organize a an Indianapolis meetup for
tomorrow but I don't think that's gonna
be able to happen if I have no internet
what's up
we have sites they have sites okay she
said that we can go up there and just
pretty much take whatever we want
don't need internet for ski bubble yeah
so we're gonna go ahead and set up the
tent and you know I'm sitting here
thinking that oh there's poison ivy
there yeah let's not touch that hmm
you know like I could take the car and
like drive to where there's Wi-Fi but
it's like this is supposed to be a
family vacation and I really need to put
the YouTube thing like on the side and
spend time with my family and I hope
people will understand this is a perk of
the camp site this is kind of cool it's
got a little playground here for the
kids
okay eating dinner you want to come see
what reading for dinner we cooked out
all of our food on the fire and then
Facebook cooking right and this is Jon's
chicken kabob that's mamas this is manis
ticking this is daddy's chicken kabob
all right kids what are we doing
toasting marshmallows yes there's mine
how do you like your marshmallows I like
mine brown on the outside like I like to
like cook mine for a while so it gets
all gooey on the inside and then like
toasty Brown on the outside how does
your friend like them she takes so she
takes a Martian she put the in the fire
and catch it on fire she waits like six
seconds and then she dried only close it
out and then it's like completely black
there you go John how do you like your
marshmallows
buta and it wasn't that bad no we've
never made smores before you're still
missing out I found out that not
everybody has made smores like that's
not a thing everywhere look they're
turning black though that's kind of
creepy
look it's like floating like they can
put them on your head I know I don't
know why they're gray they're like smoky
so this is what I'm thinking the next
two fish palette should be
a s'mores themed palette you know you
get your chocolate colors you got your
graham cracker colors you got your
marshmallow colors it would probably
have to be like the peanut butter and
jelly palette the smaller palette yeah I
don't know if there's enough versatility
in that palette I might be taking it
back but these are really good and I
keep thinking about eyeshadow and that's
just a sign of sickness I think of
serious addiction and I keep thinking
about the community and how I can't talk
to any of you because we have no Wi-Fi
and we have no 4G or whatever like
there's no way for me to contact anybody
and it's freaking me out
and something just dripped on my face
and I hope it was not I hope it was rain
and not some kind of animal peeing on me
oh these are good though I wish I could
share them with you here you one buddy
mmm oh my gosh it's so dark oh but I'm
getting really nervous about what's up
and makeup on Sunday because at this
point typically I have the script it's
completely done and all I have to do is
film and then edit because I had no
internet I don't even have images in
order to make the script in order to
film in order to edit so I'm like really
behind schedule so I'm really nervous
that it's not gonna pull together like
I'm kind of freaking out right now so
I'm gonna try really hard to get what's
the makeup up on Sunday but if I can't
get a decent Wi-Fi not Wi-Fi single but
a decent 4G signal and be able to
capture things onto my phone email it to
my computer make a script film edit all
tomorrow
like I'm so sink and nervous that this
is just gonna just crash and burn so we
will see what happens but this is the
end of day one and it was overall a good
day it's just freaking out man it's hard
to do this stuff on the road like she's
not working out the way I expected it to
so we'll see what happens
bad laughs I must see him
