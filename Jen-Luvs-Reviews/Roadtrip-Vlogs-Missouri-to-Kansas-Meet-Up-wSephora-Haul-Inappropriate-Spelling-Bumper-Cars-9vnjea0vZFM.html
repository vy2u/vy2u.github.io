day it is John says it's a 60 even know
ok so today is the Kansas City meet up
I'm so excited to meet some very special
people like I saw the list of people
that are coming and I'm super excited to
meet everybody um but I did get ready
and I wanted to show you what I use to
get ready now the lighting in here is
terrible today say five hi can you do
stop yelling buddy okay thanks I yeah
today okay today I thought it was day
five dude anyway I keep looking up at
myself my monitors up here so I
apologize if I keep doing that because I
was like looking at this terrible
lighting and how much I'm not happy with
it so anyway let me tell you what I use
today so I used on my eyes again the
violent los laura-leigh palette I had a
little bit of trouble working with the
green called smashley it was really kind
of messy to work with and when I try to
use larlie with it which is the set of
the first one on the second row the
green really mixed into it really badly
like when I was going back and forth and
it really messed with laura-leigh a lot
so I had to do some work to clean up
Laura Lee to get the green out of it
they did not it was not good and also
blending was a bit of a challenge I
still don't feel like I'm completely
blended in the crease I used Priss pot
and mama bird and then I above the
crease I used a little bit of
ragamuffins so those um on the top row
the last three in the top row in the
outer corner I used bubs and yeah that's
pretty much it highlight I used what's
just money you could pretty thank you
honey that's annoying you I would it's a
magic make up sweetheart I use for
highlight i use the it's called unicorn
luster in the highlight palette by
violent los and i don't i see it but
it's a little more subtle the one on the
left I can't even see it because there's
so much powder hold on a minute the one
on the left is called moon glean that
was when i use before that one I feel
like I liked better as far as like how
it should
up on my skin I haven't used the middle
one yet anything else Smashbox contour
palette for the contour that's all I
brought for contour lower lash line and
use the monster eyeliner that I got in
MC think maybe boxy try my forget it to
their FC your boxy charm and then i use
the largely shade on the lower lash line
as well let's see anything else I want
to tell you browse I use the brow brow
cabrillo I'm really really liking this a
lot really liking this I like it better
than the Anasazi a brow is and it's
crazy because I wouldn't have expected
that from benefit typically benefit is a
pro brand that I don't go oh my goodness
this is great like it's goodbye uncle oh
my goodness this is great very much from
benefit so pretty excited about this
product and it's beautiful too it's
beautiful home so that's pretty much it
for my hair I use my my Beach waiver s1
this is the best curling iron of all
time I am a hair idiot I cannot do hair
to save my life this thing is amazing
look at these curls what it does I
turned it off let me turn it back on so
I can show you okay so what you do is
you clip your hair in it and then it
rolls it but something about this one I
don't know what it is but it's pretty
stinkin amazing I mean how it uh how it
curls and the curls last all day like
it's really really the best curling iron
I've ever used before this I use my new
me alot I like this way better than the
new me way better so yes so that's it
for the getting ready part um the kids
are being awfully loud so as far as the
car break-ins situation oh this is much
better lighting as far as the car
break-in situation we talked to the
insurance company today and it looks
like they're going to cover most of our
laws they do say that things are going
to depreciate a bit so we don't know
exactly what that means but there is
going to be a little bit difference for
what we paid versus what we're going to
get back but our insurance our renters
insurance is going to cover most of it
we did have a hundred-dollar deductible
of course we have to pay that we had a
five-hundred-dollar deductible on the
window so we had to pay four hundred
dollars for the
no sir we're like five hundred dollars
in the hole plus whatever they'd
appreciate the the items to be so
thankfully we are going to get a lot of
money from the insurance company for the
materials but we definitely are paying
for it which which totally stinks that
somebody did that and stole our stuff if
you don't know what I'm talking about go
back to the earlier blog i'll link it
down below that our car was broken into
and all our electronics were stolen so
so that's the progress on that I am
thankful that we had insurance to cover
most of it but it does stink that we
have to definitely still pay some out of
pocket for it but you know that's to be
expected and and this is the thing we
shouldn't have left all those with
electronics in the in our car I mean we
we just weren't even I mean we hit
everything like he did meaning there was
nothing sitting out in the open but I
guess with the cab on the topic it looks
like we're traveling it out of state
plates I don't know who knows so so yes
I'm going to go ahead and pop off here
