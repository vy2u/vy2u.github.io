still asleep and John's doing some work
and I am almost ready to go but I wanted
to show you what I put on my face today
but before I do I want to tell you where
I am I am and a New Orleans with my
family I'll show you our view down a
little creepy we're in New Orleans today
and we are headed to Florida once we get
on the road so let me show you before I
get going I think I woke the baby's up
before I get going let me show you what
I put on my face today
so yesterday I used the worldly palette
but I used it with the with a Mac's
Paint Pot I don't tell you what the Mac
Paint Pot is okay so I used this Mac
Paint Pot in the shade vintage selection
that's brand new to me so I have a lot
of experience with this but when I got
home at glitter like all over my face so
I was like okay I'm gonna take this out
and I'm gonna try some other things I've
had really good luck with the violet
boss Laura Lee palette so I was hoping
that maybe it was the Paint Pot but then
it's like a brand-new Paint Pot so now
I'm like sad that maybe my paint pot has
fall out I don't know I'd love to know
in the comments below if you have that
Paint Pot and whether it has fall out
because that was not attractive so
anyway let me show you the palette and
what I use today I used some different
shades sorry if it's so shaky so I used
ragamuffin up in the crease
instead of mama bird I've been using
mama bird a lot and I really like mama
bird I used all over my lid that she
called Yoshi let me swatch that for you
look in the pan but it actually comes
out quite light on the lid it's like a
duo chromey shade so I use that all over
the lid and then I use Laura Lee let me
show you the swatch before I pick it
back up that's another duochrome that's
the one on my middle finger
that is in the inner corner just a
little bit so I'll show you lorilee in
the pallets larlie
is the first one in the second row and
then Yoshi is the fourth one in the
third row and then on the outer corner I
used bubs which is the third one in the
bottom rule just to kind of deepen off
the outer corner a little bit and then
on my lower lash line I put the Yoshi
shade and then a little bit of bubs on
the outer corner I also touched up a
little bit of black eyeliner because I
felt like the bubs was not enough if
you've been watching this vlog do you
know that I've really been liking the
Cobra alibi benefit from my brow so what
I decided to do today is I used that as
eyeliner today because I'm curious to
see how that would work as an eyeliner
so I will let you know then for my
cheeks I use my Smashbox contour palette
this is the original one the contours
which is one of my favs and then for
blush I use I took a break from the
Jaclyn hill palette I use fresh melon by
city color which is a very pigmented
blush you have to kind of blend it out
and then for my highlight I use the
violet Voss highlighting powder in the
shade unicorn luster which is the last
one let's say it's the peachy one over
on the right side there right here this
one right there
that went well and I can't really see
that one as much as I can see the other
ones I'm not sure about this one will
sing oh one thing I want to mention as a
base under the eyeshadow a used NYX
pencil and milk because I wanted to try
something different underneath a Laura
Lee palette to see if that would help it
to last better because lasting power
yesterday with the matte Paint Pot was
really not good in comparison with other
times I've used it so moving on ago so
on my lips today I have swag by bare
minerals it's their new liquid lipsticks
and I really like this formula
it's really like it I find the lighter
shades don't last as long as the deeper
shades but really really loving it so
I'm gonna go ahead and shower my
children because it's shower day because
we have Odell and it's time for a Java I
just don't wash it out well that's my
hair is so poofy we are going to a an
Insectarium which I'm excited about and
we'll see you a little bit
there we go and that's where we're going
guys creepy oh there we are they alive
when they lure no those are cave
cockroaches oh my goodness there's a
worldwide insects out way humans 50 to
one that's crazy that's a lot of bugs or
a lot of insect a lot of insects crazy
as you think about how much one insect
way is compared to one person that's a
lot of insects
Parise

been inspired by these guys those nail
polishes that are like 80 bucks apiece
or whatever and maybe they're not that
much those things are crazy
