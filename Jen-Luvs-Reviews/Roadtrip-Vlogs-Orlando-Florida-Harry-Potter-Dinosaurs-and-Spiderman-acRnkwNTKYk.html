made it barely onto the shuttle we did
our little timeshare presentation like
flowers it did it literally took like
two hours they said it was going to be
90 minutes that was not nine minutes so
if you ever decide to do one of these
timeshare things in Orlando just budget
in two and a half hours but then when
they start talking too much tell them
it's been 90 minutes and you're going to
call the manager if you don't get us
going because that's what John did we
saved a lot of money doing we did save a
lot of money we saved about 400 bucks
doing that with the hope between the
hotel in the tickets so it was worth it
but you can only do it one time because
supposedly they communicate with all of
the other places and make sure you can
only do one timeshare presentation for
like your life so needless to say we are
not buying a timeshare
what do you think about buying a
timeshare baby no I mean it's very
pressure sales it's very by now by now
by now and they don't give you time to
think about it which is always a bad
sign anybody trying to pressure you it's
either Now or Never don't ever do it
because if their product was good enough
it wouldn't have to pressure you to buy
right now right right that's right what
are you kids are you excited Johnny you
quit yep they're they're just tired they
didn't get much sleep last night we had
to be at the presentation at eight
o'clock which was seven o'clock in our
previous time zone so they couldn't go
to sleep last night they didn't go to
sleep until about eleven o'clock this
time zone time so they got like no sleep
so I'm hoping that
Silas and that for now you are this is
crazy i don't remember walking into
universal like this

so we'll see you in important welcome to
Universal Orlando Resort there we go got
some Taylor on the screen over there

in line waiting to get the tickets to go
be in so he's got a lot of people still
in front of him it's kind of crazy like
that we're waiting an hour just to get
into the fork to get the tickets like
insane a seemed very efficient
first century

faster here

minutes for him to get the tickets
