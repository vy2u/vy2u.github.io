what we're gonna do today and one of the
attractions they have here is a zombie
thing where you get checked chased by
zombies and if you know me you know that
I'm terrified of zombies
so it's called zombie outbreak Orlando
yeah no thank you
so we uh we are gonna go get some lunch
because we got up super late because we
have not been getting good sleep for a
while - she did wake us up she woke us
up at 9:30 anyway so we are gonna go get
some lunch there's a panini spot we're
gonna check out after that we're gonna
go down International Drive and just
kind of see what we can see check out so
museums maybe something like that and
then the kids really really really want
to go to the pool and play some mini
golf I'm very excited that I finally had
a vlog upload and the first comments are
people laughing at me and making fun of
me for not knowing things and it's like
oh it's not a fun to be laughed at even
if you're not trying to be mean if
someone says you know oh you're wrong
huh silly you know it's like is that all
you got out of it was that I didn't know
what an animal was or something it's
like come on I don't see elk in
Baltimore how am I supposed to know an
elk versus a deer I you know you know I
mean like the deer and the either by
where I live don't look like that so
whatever you know what is that that's
all you gotta say is I mean like it's
like just a horrible way to start the
day so I'm hoping the day will get
better from here on it so it's like I've
been waiting for this video to upload
for two days and that's all people have
to say as negative things like
all right I will see you guys in a
little while
yes so we just had lunch at hot crust
panini kitchen and it was amazing it was
really good all the food was super fresh
and like homemade stuff and it's like
super high rated for a reason it was
really good I had like a barbecue
chicken pineapple panini
she had dessert for lunch
turkey and she is he
chocolate chips and then what did you
get buffalo chicken did you like it yes

park I can't do that because of my foot
so I started walking around this like
crazy mall this place is so neat it's
got a lot of like independent artists
and stuff have set up stores here but
they look like real storefront kind of
things like it's not like a little
boutique like a flea market II looking
like it looks so official so like
there's like this art exhibit it says by
Saint Cloud High School and it's just a
bunch of steampunk stuff like super
super cool there's like blown glass like
so swings and things that looks awesome
oh my gosh the kids would love that
you saw the earlier vlog of the kids and
the husband and the hammock like they
would love this stuff
so I like the glass stuff reminds me of
when we went to the Children's Museum
and they had all that blown glass at the
all up on the ceiling it was really cool
stuff super neat rock and bizarre kinds
of really cool stuff there I mean this
is just really neat Florida soap company

you did it so it looks like Lil Jon
might want to try one of these ones that
don't look quite as scary I'm hoping
that he'll try it
he's kind of contemplating he can go
down the steps at this point or he can
go on one of the he knew ago in that
ladder or he can go on the Rope there
and he's choosing the steps that's a
bummer I thought he might try the ladder
but he's choosing the steps
all right what he has to do what he's
comfortable with
there is Lyle up there on that top beam
Rolland right behind her breathing down
her neck
she backed off a little bit
I can watch him down here if you want to
go back up why don't you go back up and
have fun and I'll take care of him
she's up there you see her yeah she's
ziplining just about the zip line there

and it's really cool about the little
one it's amazing how these kids are
working together to try to get to where
they need to go because you can only
have one they've these little junctures
and sometimes one kid is in the way of
another kid continuing and they work
together to figure out how they're gonna
get past each other and it's really cool
watching them work together it's really
neat right now there's nobody really in
conflict but but it's definitely

yeah yeah it's good for building majora
and this place is amazing I am getting a
necklace
I don't know which one I'm gonna get I
have no idea but I'm gonna put the
website link down below in case you
think this stuff is a school if I think
it is it's just it's www Jo are tra calm
so let me show you these things they're
amazing
so she hand makes all this stuff so
you've got section that's made with
orange peels you got these like
beautiful like necklaces here and
they're like super lightweight because
this isn't metal it looks like metal but
it's not it's like straight and that
beautiful and then she's got like all
these colors and they look like little
roses they're beautiful and then like
this one is one I'm thinking about
getting this one right here is really
really pretty like I love the purple one
but I feel like I'm limiting myself if I
get the purple one so I'm thinking about
either getting this one or one of the
coffee bean ones I'm not really sure yet
so she's got like bracelets and then
she's got earrings and let me bring you
over here these are gorgeous dude so
these are the cantaloupe seed ones and
she hand dies all of these seeds aren't
they so pretty
you're just gorgeous like I love this
one and then she's got these earrings
just let me show you for size I don't
think they are but like this one right
here this is the one with the coffee
beans and she said if you put it in like
a bag with like regular coffee beans
it'll maintain the flavor so those are
like all the different ways that you can
wear it so you can even wear it as at
the belt like how awesome is that like
super cool so I wish you were here to
tell me which one I should get I'm gonna
let my family help me decide then I'll
show all right so we just had dinner
we're about to head down to the pool do
some swim is my grandma looking baby
suit we lost the goggles we're not sure
what happened to those I'm sure they're
around somewhere well we can still slash
around in the water there you go so
we're gonna go ahead and do a little bit
of swimming in the pool way back a
little bit I can't bring you with me cuz
it's too wet down there also I bring you
with me but I hello my friend so it is
the middle of the night John just
finished sort of finished doing the
laundry unfortunately the dryers here
aren't very good so they're not good so
the clothes are still wet so we're gonna
try to lay them out around the room man
we are not staying here ever again we
went down to the pool and there was like
it didn't look dirty but like as far as
like the water was clear but there was
stuff floating all in the water like
they hadn't skimmed it recently and
there was stuff all on the bottom of the
pool like the baby pool either it looked
like somebody threw up in it or there
was just a bunch of junk collected in
one spot I don't know it was just kind
of gross I mean we swam anyway because
it didn't look like it was dirty dirty
it just looked like it needed to be
skimmed you know what I mean
so it's everything that kind of had a
funky smell to but yeah so you know the
kids were excited to swim so we just
weigh them anyway you know you know that
is so yeah we're not very impressed with
this place but I mean again we got it
for very very cheap so we're finding out
why we got it for very very cheap it's
like it wants to be a resort like it
could be at like a nice resort but yet
people don't keep up with it like maybe
they're like cutting corners or like
being cheap or something with it and
they're just not doing things they
should and that the the restaurant
wasn't good the pool needs to be clean I
mean just you know it's just not a good
hotel for being a place that you would
want to buy a timeshare in if you miss
the old the other vlog it's like a we
got a deal because it's like one of
those things you buy a timeshare here
and there's no way we would ever want to
come back here let alone purchase a
place here but anyway so we will we're
going to bed now we're actually leaving
here tomorrow morning so we will see you
tomorrow and mad love to you I'll see
you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
