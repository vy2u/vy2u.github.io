Florida so I came out on my porch to do
my makeup check-in for today show you
what I use on my face before we go to
Universal Studios we went to islands of
adventure yesterday and today we're
going to the regularity Universal
Studios which I've never been to so I'm
pretty excited to go but before let me
show you what's around me so show you
why it's so loud so right outside you
can see there's like a little kiddie
pool and then there's a couple of fools
out there the hot tub and another pool
so that's why it's a little bit loud out
here but the lighting is the best out
here so you can see what I use now I use
I tried to really simplify it today
I didn't use any foundation you can see
I'm like super shiny my moisturizer is
just kicking and it's hot out here so
I'm very very shiny I don't know what
possessed me to put on highlighter today
like totally I don't know but my
eyeshadow today all I used was like
Jacqueline Hill palette frosh of the day
I'm curious to see how it's going to
where I used herbs
eaten as a base and then I just you
champagne pop all over the lid and then
I use amaretto in the crease and that's
all my eyeshadow is and then my cheeks
today I just used the the rose spritz
which is the one on my on the left there
my left for the left and then for my
lips today I used Oprah's charmed and
then I all rain that with bare minerals
what is this hemp and I'm telling you
these things if the lip glosses are half
as good as the liquid lipsticks
girlfriend the lasting power definitely
could be better but I will trade lasting
powerful formula you know for the the
comfort of it and the look of it like I
will all three if I don't mind
reapplying if it feels good it looks
good and smells good so full review on
these and the lip glosses when I get
back the lip glosses should be waiting
for me when I get home so anyway so
today we are headed out we are gonna get
some breakfast downstairs in the lobby
and then we're headed to the shuttle so
with the ice we're at Universal Studios
the original one your big old roller
coaster going down right now
and we're gonna go check out this
Terminator 2 3d ride turns out it's a
show and it starts at 12 so we probably
won't stick around for that we're gonna
keep going cuz that's about 30 minutes
from now
there's a Max Factor makeup studio
I don't think it's real I think it's
just a storefront I don't think it's
really a maxfactor
oh look at scooby-doo scooby-doo and
Shaggy see scooby-doo and Shaggy John
wait he said he's gonna be right back no
there's the Mystery Machine we should
get one of those for our next tour no we

I just want to go in the maxfactor wish

all right so we're gonna go Nikki ride
this is an intimidating-looking the
building here
50 minute wait whoa
so I love the little hesitancy go in the
waterslide so she's having John go test
it out for see what it's like so you
should be coming down pretty soon

look too good to me but I'm sweating my
face off right now

really liked it even though there is a
guru which is like my thing that I think

thing I'm not throwing up as good
yeah it'll feel better soon what else
did I want to tell you Oh like the fire

that was fun I'll miss it
I'm filming this one from a bar because
the camera could get ruined if I take
you in there it's embracing them
so this is the Curious George land so
you've got these kids up here shooting
these water cannons and there's water
cannons over on the other side and
inside this building is all kinds of
water traps and things
over the top of each building is a
bucket if it fills and then dumps over
then inside that bag thing that says the
ball Factory you basically fill up these
machines with these little softballs and
you shoot them at people able to say the
children have been in there for a long
time they are soaked to the bone
water
they want to play like 10 more minutes
and then we're gonna head to a couple
more rides but they're so soaked and
there's no more Sun out to dry them so
I'm not sure how this is going to work
them getting on the indoor rides so
they'll probably be freezing but there's
nothing we can do at this point as far
as drying them so we're just gonna kind
of roll with it and the out goes let's
check on the eye shadow I can't really
see
that was the Becca palette it looks
pretty good to me
my face is gone is that sweat or rose
spritz
I'm feeling it sweat
are you guys ready to go you guys set
you up bud
a wall of water all right we are dying
with universal it was so much fun the
Transformers ride was really good and
it's crazy because usually my stomach
can't handle things like that and I my
stomach did really well this trip which
is made me super duper happy that I've
gotten to go on some rides we're heading
out of Universal now we're gonna catch
the shuttle back to the hotel and we're
gonna have leftover pizza cuz that's we
ordered late last night was that lucky

mini golf place we're not really sure
let me show you something that's really
really frustrating this has been
uploading this vlog has been uploading
since 1 a.m. 2 nights ago the internet
here is so bad as far as like YouTube
uploading those doesn't have an error I
tried to redo it a couple of times and
it's just not working so once I realized
it was like taking a really long time I
tried to re-upload in it but it's just
so I haven't been able to put up any
vlogs because that one has been sitting
there for two days uploading so yeah not
so impressed with the internet here yeah
so you're very happy with your fluff
yeah oh and Jon's very happy with his
spider-man and he got yesterday and now
he's watching apparently he's watching
Annoying Orange so we're gonna say
goodnight and we will see you tomorrow
