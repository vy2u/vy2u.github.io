friends welcome to Salt Lake City I'm
excited to be in salt lake city I've
never been in salt lake city before we
were driving along really late last
night and then all of a sudden there was
this big black puddle I was like oh I
like on the map like we're like you
driving him and there's like all of a
sudden there's this big thing it's like
oh my goodness that's great thought wake
we're traveling by it which room do you
tall this is amazing so we just got the
kids up it's about about nine o'clock or
so so we're gonna go ahead and we're
going to head down to breakfast at the
hotel once we get up here I'm gonna get
ready with some makeup and i can't wait
to wear it to do my hair and do my
makeup and feel like me again i got to
do my skincare routine last night and it
felt so good in my skin care routine
this morning and i'm so happy i love
camping and I loved Yellowstone but it's
really nice to get back to a hotel for a
night and then to my don't know what
we're gonna do tonight I don't know if
when you stay hotel or what tonight
we'll have to wait and see so all right
so what I will check into guys after
breakfast oh I feel like I look like me
again I don't look like me in a long
time it's funny how makeup can make me
feel like I look like me even though I
looked more like me really and truly
before I put the makeup on if that makes
sense you so i got this tory burch a
shadow palette from my friend Nicole
over yay or nay Nicole I don't see any
other name on here I will show you the
shades though the shades look like these
and I had trouble making it into a
complete eyeshadow look but i'll tell
you about the shape that i did use I use
the peach one up on the top right called
little bit for all over my lid well
actually it was like the outer the outer
two thirds and then I used morning no
blushing which is the bottom one on the
left I use that one on the inner half
and then I used folly which is the first
one on the second row in my outer corner
to kind of deep in up the outer corner
and come up into the crease a little bit
I did
have to supplement a little bit with my
violet not my but my friend sahaja is
all my friends are helping me the violet
Voss laura-leigh palette which I'm
definitely going to have to figure out a
way to purchase this because I really
love it I use press pot which is the
third one on the top up in the crease
and I think that's all I used from this
no i didn't use / spot i use mama bird
which is the on the top row the fourth
one is what i used up in my crease folly
on the lower lash line just in the outer
at out of like corner of it to the
middle now for cheeks today I used the
Jacqueline hill becca jaclyn hill
palette and what I did was I did what
the guy in the store said he swatched it
and it looked amazing the top left blush
which is called rose spritz and I mixed
that with champagne pop on the on the
top of my cheeks for the highlight /
blush and then for contour I used this
the only contour that I brought the
Smashbox contour palette and I just use
the one on the Left which is the contour
shade and then for lips today I'm using
this also from sahaja the the Gwen
Stefani lip pencil the red one I think
she only had one and then oprah's Ares
which was part of the man emu a
collection so I mixed those together for
my lips today because I feel like Ares
kind of I don't know it's not my
favorite for by itself like I feel like
it's almost too peachy like it's too
painty looking so I think mixed with the
lip liner it kind of gives it a little
bit more dimension so I really like it a
lot of making look great and it makes ya
dimension and I think it came out really
really good i'm happy with my look for
today and we are about to go to the Salt
Lake City meet up and I know my friends
Mandy and Jen are going to be there and
I think another friend jen is going to
be there as well I don't know if anybody
else is coming so don't you surprise
anybody else so we will check in with
you at the meetup yeah so we are in
parking garage of the mall we're running

Sanders trying to trick people no do you

really really good by the way for those
makeup lovers out there I tried on one
of my bare minerals and new bare
minerals liquid lipsticks and I am
loving it it smells like chocolate which
one by wearing I am wearing schwag I
believe
goes on super smooth yeah and it smells
like straight-up chocolate milk smells
amazing now feels really comfortable
husband the chocolate boat yes we were
all like oh my gosh smells like
chocolate in here and it was my liquid
lipstick which makes me super happy it's
super comfortable it's not sticky at all
it doesn't feel drying like it's not
moist rising but it's not like sugar
house it's not moisturizing but it's not
drying either and I really like the way
it feels and it's made it through the
chocolate pretty well so far I think it
looks good alright so we'll bring you
back in a bit okay so these are what the
chocolates are there just call Utah
truffles it just has orange truffle
Belgian milk chocolate but there's no
other identifying information as far as
like the brand or anything I guess are
just called Utah truffles they're pretty
stinking good they're like super creamy
and amazingness they kind of remind me
of the Dove chocolate bars but creamier
amazing amazing that's like they're not
like hard truffles they're like a really
smooth creamy truffle yes yours is
really good yeah John's was the regular
milk chocolate when i'm all right i'm
cooking in the car hood so on here where
we going we are going to cedar cedar
city or cedar springs
cedar city I think dude or something
haha where were you in there Zion
National Park we're gonna we're gonna
camp no we're going to stay there for
the night in a hotel and then we're
going to head to Zion in the morning
yeah we're just going to like stand out
at all night chill out
kind of enjoy the air-conditioning
because the next few days is going to be
hot exploring
snowpark and going to Grand Canyon
there we go maybe nice town a little
prick duck out it's a skip bo whether
Rock see the rock if it's white it's
snowing it's moving it's windy it's wet
its rating there's the rough that's
awesome has a big be on it why not why
be beaver beef Bieber I guess we're in
beaver we're in beaver but there's a bee
on the mountain over there look see it
for some reason the mountains around
here have letter names and I don't
really so back to your horrible yellow
lighting hopefully I can correct it some
so we are kind of making some changes so
the first thing we want to say is John
why are you so excited you can train you
look at he really want to stay in a
motel instead of a hotel I don't know so
I told him I booked a hotel and he was
very upset because he wanted a motel and
then we came up we found out it was a
motel so he is very very excited and
then Lila hurt her foot earlier in the
day at the play place at the mall so
she's been limping all day but she's
starting to feel much better this will
migrate here but this is the issue
because Zion is mostly a very big hiking
spot my foot has not been feeling
fantastic it's fine if you've been on my
channel for a while you know I hurt my
foot back in October a generation beauty
and it still has not fully recovered I
won't go into all the details of it but
so my foot isn't great for long hikes
Lila hurt her foot today so we may
change our plans and instead of going to
Zion we might go to bryce canyon instead
bryce canyon that's what it's called
right Bryce Canyon Bryce National Park
what is that smell bryce canyon ice one
make sure senator
I know but I think color correct it like
a potato you do kind of look like a you
know but you're you're very attractive
potato if I if I were going to pick a
potato I would pick you so we might do
Bryce instead because it seems like it
might be a little more kid-friendly
whereas I on just seems like it now look
at the potato with the hat we're gonna
decide in the morning but I have a
feeling we're going to end up at Bryce
we might end up skipping Zion completely
and then just going to the Grand Canyon
so we're going to end the vlog for
tonight we're gonna get the kids ready
for bed and we're gonna get up bright
and early and I'll take you with me so
hopefully you turn it for the next vlog
like everything yeah very late so I will
see you guys tomorrow for the vlog
hopefully you will be here with me and I
will take you wherever we end up going
which is probably gonna be Bryce so i'll
talk to you guys tomorrow mad love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
