and we set up and know the night so we
had no idea we were going to be looking
at we woke up in the morning so there is
our tent and this is our view of Lake
Powell of course down there is all the
ideal spots but those were all full but
this isn't so bad a little bit of
privacy out here and then over here we
have mountains and such little hilly
kinds of things we're gonna spend the
day in Lake Powell and then we're headed
to the Grand Canyon so I'm excited to
bring you with me and we're gonna pack
up this tent and we're gonna get rolling
I am hungry I'm ready for some breakfast
yeah like stickers and our like sticker
bushes and our feet we did and went out
of the tent and I found a scorpion in my
sandal it's carrying a dead bug right
so this is a very creepy kind of spot
and that there's lots of creepy bugs but
other than that we're good Arizona State
Line higher zona my utah Grand Canyon
say goodbye say goodbye by Utah I
Arizona it's been nice yeah we have fun
in Utah this is the marina and Lee cow
and we are about to go on a boat tour I
forget exactly where we're going on the
boat tour too but some kind of caverns
or something oh no John picked it out I
don't even know I was just trying to
charge my phone a little bit I've been
on my phone all morning because we
actually have some internet service here
so updating the community and answering
comments on my videos is all that I kind
of killed my batteries only have like
twenty three percent so I was trying to
charge it a little bit before you go on
this boat tour make sure I can take some
pictures so I just let my phone it's an
airplane mode so that i can stay off the
internet and save my battery for the
important things like taking pictures of
my family in this beautiful scenery so
I'm about to go back into the gift store
that's where I know you can't see me
that's where we are going to be to be
leaving for the torso I'll catch up with
you in a minute
okay so this is antelope canyon
people over there
you
made it to horseshoe bend but there was
an issue and you look over here there's
a red sign and it says warning extreme
heat uh you know that you need water and
no sandals and wear a hat and all the
stuff and oh and my kids and well mostly
my kids yeah and my kids were
complaining about walking up from the
marina in the heat walking up from the
boat all the way up to the the gift shop
or whatever so we don't think that they
would do well on a mile little over a
mile hike to horseshoe bend in extreme
heat so John went on his own to
horseshoe bay horseshoe bend where she
bend and he's going to take pictures
from there see it'll be easier for him
just to do it on his own he can go to
his own pace isn't worried about anybody
whining around him he can just enjoy it
and it's just better I mean this just
does not look fun I'm looking at that
it's like that does not look appealing
it's just like oh let me just walk up
into the desert in 100-degree he that
that's good so kids are you good with
not going to horseshoe bend floss yeah
you're happy about that haha they're
excited not to go because they get to be
in an air-conditioned car instead and
play on their media and eat snacks which
is much more appealing and going on a
hike well if it was if it was like it
was like AG
yeah yeah that's too much too much so
yeah so John's having a good time and I
hopefully get some good pictures and
i'll insert the pictures here if i can
avenge took from his hike and kind of
tired so yeah I work
we are in like a legit desert like it's
a desert the wind is blowing like crazy
there's like broken down cars and stuff
it's like wasteland teenage wasteland
he's just crazy looking like I've never
seen a desert go real legit yeah it is
in the desert result of mirages yeah
there's too many cars going to be Mirage
that would be awesome we're hungry
there's a burger king
the only that's a mirage bosses an RV
you're welcome we're in the desert oh no
I don't think anything and live out here
there's no there's no food oh there's
some animals got some horses out there
some little poor little
emaciated horses oh my gosh they are so
I found this food looked really really
good it's called Navajo soul food had
really good reviews from April so we get
here and this is what it looks like it
says jewelry sale open yes open but
there's nothing here like it's like
there's nothing here it says open but
there's nothing so I I don't think it's
really open even though that said open
yes open i'm very disappointed looking
for my Navajo soul food and we do not
get it it might be because it's late on
a Sunday too yeah it's not really late
for 30
plan for the evening is we are stopping
by the Grand Canyon for the evening then
we are driving to a nearby town and
we're going to chop it Alaska drive into
a nearby town in that town we are going
to stay in a hotel very inexpensive
hotel I hope and then we are going
someplace called Berra zone tomorrow is
a controlled wildlife situation where
they are wild but they still it's all
Gazoo where they have you know fit in
like cages where they have to stay in
that one particular area the whole place
is kind of free-range roaming but they
do feed the animals make sure that
they're sorry no it's loud they do feed
the animals make sure they're taking
care of a natural thing so we're gonna
do that tomorrow when we wake up in the
morning and that we're headed toward
Texas so we're going to go see the Grand
Canyon children running to the restroom
because they have to go to the bathroom
you see it guys you see it right there
rapid thank that's a grand can build it
it's right behind that Watchtower and
see a little bit here it is the grandest
of canyons or so they say it's pretty
massive whoa check it out this sure is
big hole
sign looks totally different my family's
right there they're up in the tower to
the watchtower where the family is they
are they go hold no joke big hole man
just inside here is this really room
here all kinds of artifacts and stuff
goes all the way up
so I'm going to go up these steps here
to arrange it to another room
there's the next set you look down
okay go up these other staff okay now
we're pretty much at the top who just be
careful up here honey
these little windows and things yeah
that's because you're to put money and
oh I think daddy's putting money in the
other one so we're trying to get to get
it get to a good view of the Grand
Canyon for sunset but it's already so
bright light bright light bright light
on my eyeballs it is already starting to
set so we're having some trouble finding
our way around the park we got a little
turned around it's a cut oh there's some
internet service here yes so we're just
having a little trouble navigating but
we think we're on the right path now so
hopefully we can get to the a good view
of the grand canyon before it gets too
dark so cross your fingers for is I
think we're gonna be fine but it's Suns
going down I want to be here moving okay
so we made it you can see it yeah well I
don't have much reporting time left on
this memory card so I better hurry up
made it just in time for sunset here we
go that's the shot right there that's
the anxiety phone right there and it's
anxiety all right there so you can see
all the shadows of the people there on
that rock but it's a pretty cool man you
see down way down there that's pretty
amazing oh my gosh it's a long way down
who is making me dizzy this is really
awesome
so there is our home sweet home for the
night check this place out yes we are
staying at the Highlander motel on route
66 I'm super excited to the inner route
66 hotel like this is really really neat
so um it's like Super Chief and
supposedly the rooms are really small
and I don't know it just sounds really
cool to stay on route 66 hotels like an
icon you know it's like a American
awesomeness so this can be in the vlog
