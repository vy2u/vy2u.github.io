camping breakfast for a while I think so
we're making some granola with milk and
blueberries and a little bit of
breakfast skillet so that and then this
is a making some water for coffee and
our little thingy here so once we eat
our breakfast we're going to finish
packing up the tent and then we'll be on
our way
I am a good man oh are you moving on hey
no no we're almost out so everything's
packed up except for we got a couple
little odds and ends but we're almost
ready to hit the road salt lake it's
still amazing like i don't think i could
get tired of looking at this
are you crazy
do you think babe it's pretty rad
today we're going to jenny lake that's
right it's right over that Ridge
yep that's my story yep we're gonna go
there we're going to hang out and we're
going to stop by Jackson on the way
through to you
yes wow that's the plan so pretty so
we're it jenny lake there's the shuttle
boat that can take you across the lake
okay and we're not going to do the boat
we're just gonna do a little bit of
walking you okay buddy you say I'm the
king of the mountain yeah my take a
picture you guys do good shot
I just had the most amazing lunch ever
it was so good this is any Jackson we
came back to Jackson for because it's on
our way to Salt Lake and we also want to
get some postcards Lila want to send a
postcard from here to one of our friends
so we just had an amazing lunch it's
like a like all like they had like
beginning boonton free selections and
like lots of vegetables and after eating
out pouches for the last week it's
really nice to have some fresh
vegetables so good some green juice and
John got some green juice just loaded up
on so much varied amazingness so we're
like super happy now look at this week
yes finally so I had something called
what was it called him not a bonsai bowl

a bonsai bowl some start with a be bowl
when it had us yeah well I added the
chicken in but it had like a like a
lemon coconut ginger sauce on it and it
was brown rice a bunch of vegetables i
added some chicken to it so good oh my
gosh kids head cheese quesadillas which
is not an epic and then what did you
have so now we are walking through
jackson hole again to go to the toy
store and get Lyla she got an activity
book she wants to get another one she's
almost done with our activity book and
we're gonna get John a little toy and
we're gonna get some postcards and then
we are headed south just salt lake city
so we're still trying to figure out what
we want to do for the meetup Jen said
that the old toe is a good place but I
want to make sure there's like other
places to go other than altar there so I
want to check out and see like what
other shops are like right around there
are maybe we'll meet at the Sephora in
downtown Salt Lake I don't know I have
to figure that out pretty quickly though
cuz I got to start letting people know
because it's going to be tomorrow
morning so we will we'll check in with
you guys a little bit
it all tied up in it no no like the pink
one on you down what
all backward now you got to stay here in
Jackson all I need is my camera tripod
and I'll be all right home is where the
makeup mirror is you look cute in that
it's get you look cute
there you go so it's kind of cool so
when the kids walk across the street
they can hold one of these big flags so
that nobody hits them it's for adults
too but I think that's really neat so we
have officially left Jackson Hole on our
way we are driving through Bridger
National Forest bridge or natural
forests there we go so it's lots and
lots and lots of trees haven't seen any
wildlife though but they're supposed to
be heavy wild laughter here
it's a little early but I'm just see
wildlife around
sunset that's right yep kids are doing

little bit of sneaky peeky spying and
the kids are loving it and Lila what are
you doing stuff I was doing stuff and
John is stretching do you like a shirt
it says angry bears and it's from grand
teton and it's lots of bears they look
like Angry Birds and the Bears are
