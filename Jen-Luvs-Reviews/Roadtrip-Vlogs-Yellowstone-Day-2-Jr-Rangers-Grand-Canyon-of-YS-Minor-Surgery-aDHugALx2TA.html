nature made that now let's go rent a
movie here we go you that's all you baby
that's all you we can go down in a
barrel like a cartoon go super cool
doesn't it look like a bob ross painting
like got like the happy little trees on
the side and the waterfalls like all the
little trees in the background and the
sky
beautiful as we go again we have to
every now and then so we're gonna take a
little hike it's a three quarter of a
mile hike I'm not sure if that's up and
back or if that's just three quarters of
money but we're super super excited to
go on our tight what do you think while
addy got a daddy got a painful yeah so
Sean's got one
yep yep
that's right so I got my friend out my
boot has he been around he been around
for a while Harriet hey guys really
silly you've been around for a while you
know that I hurt my foot I got a stress
fracture generation beauty back in
October and my foots been doing okay but
all this walking has really been not
good for it so i got my boot back on for
the hiking portion just to kind of get
my foot a little more support I was
pretty swollen last night so hoping that
that'll help with the swelling of it and
it won't hurt so much so and it feels
pretty good right now in the boot so I'm
happy about that yeah so we're going to
take this hike and if we see anything
cool will bring deck dolls you could be
here with me right now like this is
absolutely incredible seriously
seriously
Wow
what do you think kiddo
but myself in it
here yes this is worth however many
hours drive how many hours
like 30 hours
amazing
nobody
you can tell knowledge will go on and
there's no trash like
true
fall over any second maybe move
crazy man's over there taking pictures
this thing is not good to hike in just
so you know not
how you doing kid like that baby he is
crazy
I sign but all the way down there in a
booj we're on our way back up now and
I'm doing better now that we're going
uphill I set it down because this thing
sucks going down that's hot all right we
won't back up now it was beautiful trail
I'm glad I did it but little scary a
point sort of like a mile to go that's
okay we'll gone up and it's all good I
can handle it so that one in the South
Rim Trail to chit n'ton bridge I don't
know if we actually made it to the
bridge but it was still pretty cool it's
beautiful pretty a little bit of a scary
moment Lila had gotten these earrings at
the fashion mall when we were in
Indianapolis well it turns out that it's
possible which I did not know you know
the little little circular back on there
it's possible to push these all the way
into your ear lobe which Lila just found
out she accidentally pushed the they end
of the little lumpy part i did not know
I did that because I usually pulled him
out yeah why she fiddles with them so so
she pushed them in she pushed one
completely into her ear so you could not
see the back at all and the second one
she had just pushed in so like the
circular part on the bottom was in her
ear so we just had to extract them from
her ear because the clinic is closed we
missed it by about 30 minutes because
you can't drive more than 45 miles an
hour anywhere in the park and we
realized i guess around seven or so
little before seven and we the closest
first aid station was about 45 minutes
away so we could not get to the first
day station so John used his mad skills
as a 4 feet as a piercer Houston Pierce
here and there and bactine we got some
gloves and we gonna push pulled it out
I'm pretty gross so you want to show me
your ear show me battle wound sleep see
how it's alright the night that as bad
and so they pretty much look the same
yeah so she's not wearing these for a
long time we're told my getting her some
hoops so that doesn't happen anymore and
John's feeling neglected because we've
just been paying attention to Lyla so
he's very grumpy and neglected but we're
going to give him some attention now
tragedy
over and we've got we've now been
through a tornado we've had all of our
electronics stolen and we've had a minor
surgery so we'll see what happens next
aren't you glad you tuned in to the vlog
aren't you glad all right we'll talk to
you soon bye this park is gigantic and I
think we just didn't realize how big it
is it is nine o'clock and we're still
not back we saw haven't had dinner yet
this park is so stinkin huge so if you
ever go to Yellowstone just budget in
lots of time for transitioning between
activities because park is gigantic and
we also weren't expecting 45 minutes of
surgery but even then we still would
have been home super late so yeah we got
some Wolf poop here we go things like
this and it's a it's really it's
chocolate peppermint and then John is
eating huckleberry mints there's lots of
Huckleberry stuff here supposedly
huckleberries only grow in this area I
got some huckleberry coffee they had
huckleberry honey huckleberry everything
so mints are pretty good they're decent
they're a little weird but they're
decent so yeah we're just we're still
driving oh my gosh when are we gonna get
it I'm huckleberry claws that's
right they were chocolate bear claws
with Huckleberry in them so um yeah I
was just checking in cuz we've been
sitting in the car for really long time

Sun hi babes huh I try not to shut in
job kids just went to bed I'm not sure
if they're asleep or not yeah it looks
pretty good as decent blondie bad light
um but yeah so it was a good day overall
the thing with Lila's earring was really
freaky like the kid everybody was like
after why didn't you fall get it's
because my child is screaming in pain
like I'm not gonna sit there with the
video camera in my hand I call man that
would have been awesome if you have
logged it so now I'm kind of regretting
not showing you my child screaming in
pain because now they're like all mad at
me for not doing it but no no you it's
just like there's so many weird things
all that hurts so bad weird freak
accidents like freak freak accidents
