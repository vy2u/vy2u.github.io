granola with blueberries and granola
with bananas my first casualty of my
makeup materials and stuff my 8th

sponge for complexion perfection has
grown lots and lots of mold I should
have known better than to put it in this
thing while it was wet I don't know why
I did that it was stupid and now it has
grown mold it would have been nice to
have used it more than once I'm sad
because i believe sahaja send this to me
somebody sent this to me i think it was
sahaja yeah I know a subscriber sent
this to me and it just makes me sad that
I only got to use at one time and I
stood as my fault I did it I killed it
alright so we are on our way we changed
course because we got such a late start
instead of going up to mammoth springs
we're going to go down to Grand Teton

than mammoth and we want to make sure we
have some time because we like John was
saying earlier we want to make sure we

headed and we're going to figure out
from there where we want to go and what
we want to do today so the kids just got
a new road toy so they're playing guess

kind of hard for me to hike too far so

waiting to stir so this is going to take
two cups of water and you just seal it
and let it sit for 13 minutes for every
5,000 feet of elevation you have and
then it makes you fettuccine alfredo and

sticks and then we got some wood from

a little girl and a little boy and their
parents had left them home alone for the
very first time he lived in an apartment
way up high on the top floor and they
were sitting watching a movie eating a
bowl of popcorn and the phone rang so
the older sister went over and she
answered with folks and she heard a
creepy voice another ending said i am

girl hung up the phone really quick she
told her brother she oh my goodness the
Viper said he's coming so she tried to
call her mom but her mom wasn't
answering the phone what are we gonna do
they didn't want to call 911 because
they didn't think that the police were
wouldn't believe them so they just went
back to Washington movie and they just
tried to pretend like it didn't happen
maybe it was wrong phone number then
about an hour later get another phone
call ring ring ring ring little girl
walks over to the phone and she answers
it she hears i am the Viper I am coming
up soon click uh-huh she's so scared she
goes over to her little brothers just it
was the viper again was the paper again
the little brother says you have to call
mom you have to call mom so little
brother tries to call mom and the mom
still isn't answering the phone the
visor to try to they tried to forget try
to forget about and go back to watching
TV and about 30 minutes later they hate
get another phone call ring ring ring

too scared to the little brother being
blade goes over an answer the phone
and here's the Viper say i am the Viper

time and no one's answering so they run
to the closet and may Imay hide in the
eye and then the next thing they know
