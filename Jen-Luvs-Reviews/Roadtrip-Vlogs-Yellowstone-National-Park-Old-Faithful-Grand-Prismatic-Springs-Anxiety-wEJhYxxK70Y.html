room yeah so then again and if it's an
emergency we just crawl out of bed and
go to the bathroom it's so silly my kids

not sure what we're gonna do yet we just
were just worried about getting

steam envelop kind of like when I'm
cooking on periscope open the oven and
esteem fogs up my glasses kind of what's
about to happen this is crazy it's very
wet oh wow dan crazy man can't even see

this part is really creepy because I
yeah that's not good so our front of
this crazy boiling hot springy thing and
I just about had an anxiety attack that
one of my children was going to fall
into a full of boiling water grand
prismatic spring yeah scintillating your
head off it was a great office it was
really cool but I've done I need to go I
am panic attacks oh my gosh because
people have stepped off the edge of
those things and they like boil up
instantly and they like die it's like oh
my gosh and sometimes John Little John
doesn't listen so I was like super
nervous that he was going to not listen
and go off
so I'm much better than I that that's
done I'm glad we did it but I'm glad
it's over and I never want to do that
again it was just too scary my mother
would have been flipping out I am so
glad my mother was not here for that
because she would have freaked out like
my mom didn't like me climbing high on
the jungle gym let alone walking next
spring's like that oh my gosh it was so
crazy but anyway so now we're going to
go walk on a trail toward a waterfall
