everybody doing let me show you my
scenery right now it's pretty cool kids
are playing their flutes and looking at
that makes me happy we are going to head
to Zion today we at first decided we
weren't gonna go design because we
thought it would be dangerous for the
kids but then a bunch of people told us
that there were a lot of kids their age
that were that we're doing the one hike
that we're gonna do what's the hike
called narrows the narrows so we are
going to brave the narrows today the
kids have their swimsuits on I'm gonna
get mine on - he's very excited about
having his belly out yep okay so I'm not
sure how much I'm gonna be able to bring
you with me just because of the the
water aspect but I'm gonna bring you
with me for as much as possible so we'll
check in later
welcome to Zion National Park
okay that's what it looks like look at
the sky it's guy looks really cool like
the streaks of the streaks of the clouds
are it's really cool
Springdale 13 miles effort that's really
cool town Thank You fire danger fire
dangers been high everywhere we've gone
yeah that's pretty good
sounds hotter than that it definitely
feels hotter that's right sweetheart
it's still pretty early oh wait yep 937
they stayed in that campground because
it was really close to Zion but oh my
gosh I was a crazy little campground
yeah you thought it was alright yeah
Jeff girl I don't know just a little
it's quiet
we're at a nice level spot that's true
alright I just got spoiled by the White
Yellowstone I got to do laundry last
night that's right you did John did all
the laundry last night the second time
we've done laundry so we've been on the
road two weeks so we brought like a
week's worth of laundry so we got like
another week and a half a little more
than a week and a half left where you
have to be back by the 22nd and today is
the today is the 9th July 9th there's a
bighorn sheep
it's a bighorn sheep we've never seen
one of those
position tourist rate looking at all
this cool stuff
totally totally gaping right now but
that's okay okay with that
lights required in the tunnel whoo
bicycling maybe present didn't somebody
say it's like a mile long or something
no oh it's going be dark oh no son of
mine
that was cool legit girl thrown out we
totally did
and it's a little bit different than the
other parks that we've been to in that
you take a shuttle to wherever you want
to go so we are going to the opposite
end of the park to the Narrows so we
have to wait in this line and then after
we wait in line we catch the shuttle and
it takes us there so we'll see how that
goes on roadtrippers I was reading in
that that it can be kind of gross
especially on the way back because
everybody's all sweaty and nasty so
let's open Evan
Ike it can't be that bad right right
can't be that bad BRE be good it is kind
of a long line so I don't know if we're
gonna get on the next shuttle if we'll
have to wait for the following shuttle
because it's long line we are very close
to getting on the shuttle we can
actually see the shuttles they have a
lot of them running which is pretty
awesome
and there is it's like waiting on earth
there you go
so it's like waiting in line for theme
park ride is what it comes down to you
like goes pretty long you know it's like
a long line and then it snakes through
like that so hopefully we'll be able to
get on either the next shuttle or the
shuttle afters
America seemed like bridges building
shows paintings of your way
start of the trail we're not sure how
long we're gonna be walking but we think
that it's about an hour from what we
read to get to the water so we'll see
what happens and it's gorgeous here
super super cool so it's definitely
worth the 40-minute shuttle ride the
shuttle ride actually wasn't so bad I
thought it was gonna be a little I don't
know sketchier by the National Park
shuttle ride was actually kind of nice
the narration was nice hearing all about
the different parts of the park and all
so one one thing that we totally failed
on was we forgot to bring food so we're
hoping the kids hang in there so that we
can okay we're hoping the kids hang in
there so that we can enjoy ourselves but
we'll see what happens along with us
trying to find some food
we got to stop people killed while
really high
so we're hiking in the river has a water
feel it's pretty awesome you know
looking out these big huge walls and
that's pretty cool man hey
so high up there it is it's so rad it is
John just fell in your gaze sweetie he's
good John
it's also quite busy here in case you
didn't allow two people here it's very
busy
hopefully it's not too shaky I'm walking
through all these rocks down here
and John's getting pretty deep
it's really cool
there's people up there repelling down
the waterfall where he is I found him
the red shirt they're calling down it's
crazy man all right we're leaving Zion
National Park did you have a fun time
daddy I wish that I could have done some
more hiking but I'm really glad that we
came because we were thinking about not
even coming so I'm thankful that we came
we had fun in the Narrows good time yeah
it was a fun thing good stuff and they
also swam in it it was breathing them
yeah all right John what did you want to
say on the I event yeah and was that
your favorite part yeah I can say that
I've walked in a reverb swimming River
and I slipped over their ego and hiked a
river so I am so exhausted like no joke
John wanted to hike more and I was like
and the kids are like and I feel really
bad we didn't get to do more but we are
on our way to do more fun things I don't
know what we're doing yet we are we're
leaving Zion and we are headed to go try
to find a campsite for tonight after
that tomorrow we're going to where Lake
Powell wanna Lake Powell tomorrow which
is the plan and then Grand Canyon is
after that so yes
at least the boy is honest that's what I
was saying it was hot it was a hot day
in Yellowstone man look how tight those
campers are and the type of tents are
together kind of crazy just all over and
everything's all in the open yeah
exactly
all right I'll see that but the sun's
starting to go down and they can't the
the rock the Red Rock is turning like a
purplish brownish color it's really cool
looking the way that when the sun's not
shining directly on it how cool it looks
so once again as usual we have no idea
where we're sleeping tonight no but you
know why it's kind of fun you know like
not knowing this is stressing you out
babe or is it fun you're alright okay
cuz I'm having fun with it you know just
kind of like not knowing what's gonna
happen next and that's not like me like
I'm a very like a person that really
likes to know what's happening but this
has been it's it's an adventure you know
and we know we're gonna be safe we know
everything's gonna be okay it's either
gonna be one thing or another so it's
getting really late it's 8:30 you're
done 8:35 the Sun is going down we would
really like to camp tonight the hub the
campsite that we want to go to is 51
minutes away so it's it's we should get
there a little before 9:30 which is
pushing it to set up a camp at 9:30 at
night so we're gonna see and also they
might not even have any spots
that's the other thing so we're just you
know living on a prayer take my hand oh
sorry okay so anyway that was I digress
so we're we're gonna try to stay at this
beach campsite that's 51 minutes away
and we'll see how it goes and if they
don't have sites or if we can't sleep
there we'll find a hotel we rather not
but well do do what you got to do right
so we'll see soon whether we get to
sleep on the beach tonight that'd be
really cool
so cool it's amazing there's this much
land it's just there's no people like
when you cut when you live in a big city
it seems like people are everywhere
they're like ants
you've populated everything they filled
in so much that their yards are only you
know six feet long you know and to see
this much open space it's just crazy
I mean I don't know buddy it's 9:05
right now that says we'll be there 1004
but that's not right
so we'll see hopefully okay so we found
a space to camp we went to the beach
spot and don't see those lights but
they're all over that way we're like out
here so we're probably oh there's a
rabbit
look there's a rabbit time left on my
camera so that was really fun day we had
a great time at Zion and then tomorrow
we're doing Lake Powell
