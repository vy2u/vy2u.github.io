another company called Rose wholesale
and they are a company in China that
makes fashion items and beauty items and
all kinds of stuff and I went on their
website and I was like whoa this stuff
is very inexpensive like like really
inexpensive I got everything that I'm
showing you today I think it was $30 for
everything so take that into
consideration when I show you what I got
because I did already open it because
out pays to take them in consideration
now the other thing I want to put in
here just as a little disclaimer
beforehand is that I picked these items
I did not see these in person I kind of
wish the company had sent me their
choices but I guess this is more
authentic to a true shopping experience
if you shop there so just you know keep
in mind these are things that I picked
maybe I just didn't pick the best items
so I'm going to show you and these were
sent to me for promotional purposes but
you will see that there is going to be
some honesty in this video here is the
purse that I got can I see my reflection
in this purse I might be able to this is
the most plasticky purse I have ever
seen when I looked at on the website it
looked so cute I was like oh my gosh I
need like a bigger dark brown purse this
is going to be perfect but it is like
straight like it feels like plastic it
doesn't smell like plastic it has been
out for a while they did send this to me
a few weeks ago though the texture of it
is not to my taste it does look like
like it's got kind of a leathery kind of
pattern on it but it does not feel
anywhere close to leather it feels like
plastic this is kind of some cool
detailing at the top hopefully you can
see that I do like that I do like the
hardware on it this is another problem
that there is with it I don't know where
the logic is in this like what are we
supposed to do with this I'm scared to
touch this because I
as soon as I open it I will probably not
ever be able to get it closed so I'm
just keeping it there because I'm scared
what what what is that how does that
even have so so yeah I'm not I'm not
real happy with this so far but let me
show you the other things that I got the
next thing I got is this shirt and this
again was my choice on the model it was
really cute but oh gosh I don't know
what I was thinking it reminds me of
something from Star Trek but it's got
this little button detailing on the side
um and it's just I don't I don't know I
don't know what that was um it's all
black on the back and it's just it fits
me fine it's just a very strange strange
style I don't know why I did that that
was that was my fault I don't blame them
for that next I got some jewelry pieces
and the jewelry I actually like the best
this is a headbands that I thought would
just be really cute for filming really
cute for spring so see look how cute
that is so it's it's very a stiff metal
it's got this you know little flower
here and then these leaves so I'll try
it on so you can see I think this would
be really cute on like someone even
younger than me like going out for the
night I mean I can wear it like this
I still feel even though I'm 35 I still
feel like I can wear headbands and still
rock them and it feels good if you'll
sell it on my head it's got the the
strap at the back that's like the
elastic so it's not going to hurt my
head it stays on really really well and
I think it looks really cute and if
you're one of those adventurous types if
you're like you know a little more
earthy hold on a minute and that's not
my hair let me try this again oh and
getting this thing off is kind of tricky
it kind of pulls my hair but you know
it's mostly because I'm impatient you're
going to like a show you know and you
want to rock it like this see on me I
think it looks a little ridiculous but
on the right person I think this will
look super cute like a little blond like
would look so cute like some of you
younger girls this would look adorable
happy with this happy with the quality
of it it's it's very tough metal it
seems to be put together well it doesn't
look cheap and I really really actually
like this'll oh I
have to show you the purse does have a
long shoulder strap in it yeah the last
thing that I got was a necklace and this
is also really cute and I haven't worn
it yet because I just I put the stuff in
the bag and I just waiting for it for
review but I will definitely be rocking
this but isn't that adorable the little
butterflies I will wear this all the
time in the spring it is super cute so I
mean it looks like it's pretty good
quality all of the stones are in it
doesn't look super cheap or anything it
just it looks like a cute necklace you
may get it Target or something but I
know the price is just really really
inexpensive so I definitely recommend
you check out rose wholesale for their
jewelry their fashion my personal
experience I did not find them to be
something that I would like but it might
just be the things that I chose I don't
know it but I mean the thing is is when
you when you go on a site like this
you're not investing a whole lot of
money so if you end up with stuff that
you don't like it's not like you're out
a lot of money I am interested in
getting some more jewelry from them I am
enjoying that part and they have given
me a coupon code well guess it's for
everybody but the coupon code is rose
fashion and all capital letters and you
get 9 percent off until June 30th of
2014
yeah I mean if you are interested I mean
even 9 percent more off that's going to
take more off of your order if you do
decide to order um and I definitely
recommend you check it out they have a
ridiculous amount of stuff on there
another negative that I did want to
mention is it does because it does come
from China it does take a long time to
ship it did take quite a few weeks for
it to ship to me so keep that in mind
when you are ordering that you may want
to think season appropriate you don't
want to order at the end of summer for
something you want to wear in summer you
know if you want to wear something
spring/summer order it now so that you
make sure you have it to wear for all of
spring and summer so that is my review
of my stuff that I got from rose
wholesale I hope you enjoyed this video
