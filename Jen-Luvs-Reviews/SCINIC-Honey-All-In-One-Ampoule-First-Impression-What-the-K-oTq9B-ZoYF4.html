the K where we test out Korean beauty
products to the side whether they are
worth your time and money today we are
going to be playing with some bee vomit
yup no it's not really be vomit but it
is made from 90% bee products so yeah is
it all just buzz or is it worth your
money we're going to find out right now
I was attracted to this product because
I had done some research on honey in
skincare products when I had tried a
product by skin food for what the K I
will link that video down below it was a
honey lip balm that had no honey in it
so it was like well I wonder you know
how much better would be with the honey
in it so I did some research and I found
out that honey is actually a really
great ingredient for skincare at least
that's what some research says I feel
like there really isn't enough research
in skincare in general it's like
everything I research it ends up being
well some some says this is some say
this and some say there isn't enough
research behind it I just wish that they
put more into it I really do but anyway
I saw this on HauteLook they now have a
Korean skincare section on their beauty
section occasionally through the weeks
or have a Korean skincare brand or a
makeup brand there so this is where I
found it and yet with 15 bucks for this
giant thing and this is huge it's this
big jar and then you unscrew this and
then it's just open at the top and
inside there is this like gelatinous
looking stuff it's actually not as thick
as it looks in the jar but yeah it was
very interesting it smells like it
smells like real true honey not like
that
fake stuff you get it pop eyes on your
biscuits like not that like the real
stuff that you would get in like from
like a bee vendor at a fair or something
like that you guys ever see those I know
it are like our Renaissance Fair and
stuff they have place called the bee
folk at our
Renaissance Faire and they sell all of
the beeswax products and honey products
and things like that but yeah that's
what it smells like is like real legit
honey not like that fake stuff so anyway
they also give you a little spatula to
dig in and get the product out I can
tell you right now I really don't like
this packaging I don't think it's
functional especially the more you get
into it it's going to be more difficult
to get the product out functionally I
did read a little bit about this on
reddit and a couple of other sources and
they were saying you can buy pumps for
it but it's like come on man like I
don't know I really don't like the
packaging at all I was able to find this
in that isn't available on whole look
anymore I was able to sign it on Amazon
for twenty dollars and 73 cents from
senic and then I got I also founded at
boutique for $27 and I did pay the
fifteen dollars plus the six dollars
shipping on HauteLook so I got a pretty
good deal on I mean it's a ton of
product did I even say what this is
it's the cynic honey all in one ampoule
the cynic honey all in one ampoule makes
your skin moist and soft with honey
extracting it's got a cute little bee on
there my first question was what in the
world is an ampoule because I've heard
of it before I tried some products I
think I've tried an ampoule before in a
Korean product I don't think for what
the K but otherwise but I still didn't
know what in the world it was or what it
did so I did a bunch of research and I
looked into the ten steps in a
traditional Korean skincare routine step
one is an oil cleanser that's what I
used on my face before I started filming
I'm using clinics take the day off which
of course isn't Korean but I use that I
didn't use a foam cleanser because I
didn't wear any makeup today I didn't
feel like I needed to double double
cleanse and then the next one is an
exfoliator I exfoliate my face three
days a week two to three days a week I
did not do that today next is a toner
and I didn't use a toner today because
this is supposed to be your toner your
essence and your serum all-in-one and
ampoule is kind of like I saw some
websites where they were saying an
ampoule is the same thing as a serum
it's just a different name for it some
people are saying you can use it along
with serums you can kind of wear it but
they say this brand says you don't need
a serum along with it ask
that the seventh step is a mask I don't
typically do masks except for maybe once
a week and then I cream a face cream and
then your SPF if you are going out in
the sunlight I decided I'm going to go
with what it says to do and just use
this after my cleanser so my face feels
a little bit tight and dry right now
from the take the day off it's not super
dry but it definitely has a little bit
of that just cleanse tightness to it but
before we apply it I do want to go into
some of the ingredients because the
serums and the ampoules in Korean
skincare the thing is is it's supposed
to be like everything packed together
like not a lot of fillers just
straight-up good ingredients and the
ingredients in here are kind of
ridiculous far as the amount of good
ingredients according to the research
that I've done so the number one
ingredient is honey extract honey
extract is known to be skin soothing
antioxidant add vitamins it promotes
wound healing and helps the skin retain
moisture the second ingredient is
glycerin which I love to see in skincare
it also helps retain moisture number
three is water
number four is niacinamide which is a
derivative of vitamin b3 it helps with
like age spots and discoloring it also
can protect your skin from UV damage and
it can reduce fine lines and wrinkles
redness blotchiness yellow skin things
like that it's supposed to stimulate the
circulation in your skin it can also
improve skin elasticity so nice in imide
is one of those that a lot of people
really look for in their skincare so I
was excited to see that in here as well
it's also an anti-inflammatory and can
help it treat acne now we get into more
of the B products the royal jelly
extract this is a secretion that the
worker bees have that it's like the food
for the queen bee it can help heal
wounds it's an anti-aging ingredient
it's a moisturizer it can also help skin
regrowth so if you have a blemish that
you recently like mess with and that you
know you've got any kind of scarring
then that's something that this would
help the next one is propolis extract
and I thought propolis was something
that directly came from bees but it
turned out that it not really it's
actually a resin like material that
comes from the buds of poplar and
cone-bearing trees
but humans have a lot of trouble
harvesting it so they just let the bees
harvest it and then they take it from
the bees it's an antioxidant and
anti-inflammatory it fights bacteria and
viruses and funguses they actually use
it to treat cancers there was a warning
on Web MD for this it said that if
you're allergic to be bright byproducts
including honey or conifers poplars Peru
balsam or silicates you should not use
this product if you're allergic to any
kind of beat anything you should not be
using this product and the next one is
something that I'm having a difficult
time pronouncing Centennial hazy attica
extract I'm trying and it's a perennial
herb known as GU to Kola and it can help
reduce swelling improve circulation
wound healing eczema and psoriasis so I
mean this that's the seventh ingredient
there there's no fillers in here except
for the water everything in here is like
jam-packed awesomeness then we have
polygon um cuspid a dome root extract
also known as Japanese knotweed you may
have heard that red wine is good for you
it fights cancer all of those things
Japanese knotweed is another place that
you can get resveratrol I think that's
how you pronounce it I could be
butchering it I'm sorry if I am but it
is an anti-aging ingredient and it may
protect from UV damage there's more
proof for ingestion of it in the wine
then there is topical application but
still I'm not hating minutes in here and
then something called scuttle area via
Cal insists calluses root extract it's
layman's name is Baykal skullcap it's an
acne treatment
it also can treat eczema psoriasis and
it is an antioxidant anti-inflammatory
it can protects against sun spots and
sun damage and then the 10th ingredient
is camilla census leaf extract which is
green tea extract which is one of my
favourite ingredients in skin care I've
read so much about green tea and it just
makes me really happy to see that in
here - an antioxidant anti-inflammatory
and anti-aging ingredient and the reason
why I wanted to buy this is I did do a
little bit of look into the ingredients
before I purchased it and the green tea
made me super happy to see a lot of
the other things that seem to treat
anti-aging because that's my biggest
concern
now I also notice that it could also
help a lot of other people with a lot of
other concerns including dry skin
psoriasis eczema acne things like that
so I really wanted to try this for you
and show it to you so enough with jibba
jabba let's go ahead and try this again
like I mentioned I don't like the
packaging I did use it earlier today
because I wanted to see what it was like
one thing that I read about is they say
specifically you are not supposed to use
a lot of it so I'm just going to oh my
goodness is dripping all over meetin's
oh my gosh okay that's enough that's
plenty you're not supposed to use a lot
of it and you're supposed to Pat it into
the skin and I think I used way too much
that was not smart of me okay let's just
spread it down okay we're going to try
to scrape it off
sorry bad Jen bad demo bad demo I use
way too much but when I use less this
morning I was feeling this was going to
end up drying very sticky but when I use
less this morning it felt really really
good after my skin dried down after it
absorbed it takes a good five minutes
for it to absorb into the skin but after
that my skin felt so hydrated it felt
really really good I could feel the
slightest layer of a film so my plan was
to use less of it right now but I just
totally failed on that but overall my
skin felt so good I can definitely smell
the honey in it like I could definitely
have smell that smell the last thing I
wanted to mention about the ingredients
that I forgot to mention is it does have
fragrance in it it's like the second to
last ingredient on there there's also a
ton of other ingredients I just
researched the first ten because they
were just too many ingredients I
couldn't I couldn't spend another like
hour looking at the ingredients so
overall I mean right now I can already
feel that it's seeping into the skin my
skin does feel a little bit tacky but in
the next few minutes it will totally go
away
I am absolutely loving this I'm loving
it so much that I actually think I'm
going to give this one to my mom or buy
my mom one my mom if you don't know
you've been on my periscopes and things
you might notice my mom has been
gotten some skin cancer removed from her
she spent a lot of time the Sun as a
child and also during my childhood we
spent a lot of time in the Sun lathering
up with baby oil things like that
and she has developed some skin cancer
from sun exposure so I think this would
be really really good for her I love the
ingredients in it and it makes me super
super happy it's course it's going to
take a while to see actual results from
this so this is really just the first
impression and I'm just really excited
to show this to you because I think that
this is based on the ingredients a
fantastic product and I'm definitely
going to be repurchasing this and giving
this I think I'm gonna get this one my
mom because it's so amazing I want her
to have it and then I'll buy another one
for me off of Amazon you get a giant
amount of product in here I feel like
they could be selling this thing for $60
easy instead of 20 I wouldn't be
surprised if once people start catching
on to the ingredients in this like the
reddit threads are blown up with amazing
reviews of this Amazon has amazing
reviews of it everybody seems to love it
so I think that the price may go up once
they realize and the sales go up so I'm
stocking up now I would imagine this
would last a really really long time now
I mean it's a lot of product it's a 12
month expiration it's 250 milliliters I
mean that's just in the same so right
now I'm very very happy with it I would
definitely recommend it it's one of my
favorite products that I've tried for
