hello my friends welcome to a scratch
nail wrap unboxing I haven't done one of
these in a while
scratch and I we just kind of fell apart
for a little while but now we're back
together just for this one box though
we're going out on one final date I
wanted to get scratch another chance
I was a little disenchanted with scratch
for a while because I felt like the nail
wrap selections were like come one but
lately I feel like they've really been
upping their game and I really wanted to
try it one more time just to see what I
thought now scratch is a nail wrap
company and if you don't know nail wraps
they're like real nail polish strips
that have designs on them so if you're
not used to doing your nails in designs
if you don't know how to do that if
you're not you know nail art inclined
like a lot of people are I know I'm not
super duper inclined but it's an easy
way to get a beautiful nail design on
your nails quickly and easily so you get
three nail wraps in the package and then
you also get some little extras in there
as well the information as far as cost
and all that will be down in the
description down below this box was sent
to me for promotion but I promise you it
will not influence my review as always
this is the march of box and the card is
here says strength and it says March as
a month dedicated to celebration of
women although we celebrate 24/7 we
wanted to honor the month by exploring
the theme of strength there's three
knapp nail wrap sets some tools and
accents and a surprise
you have to let's just go into what we
got first is these nail wraps here these
are okay this one I believe is called
dreamers and it is a Native American
prayer just gorgeous it's unique I can
see this not a being for everyone
but it's really cool I mean the concept
is really cool eight different sizes for
five nails there's actually two of these
strips inside so you use one set of
eight for one hand once ma for the other
hand because they're assuming that some
of these will not fit so they give you
lots of different size all right the
neck next set of wraps is called lazy
pandas and they're very very cute
they're adorable little sleepy pandas
your nails and it looks like yep it
looks like they're clear underneath so
you could put some kind of polish
underneath maybe a great polish or
something underneath to to you know make
that stand out or you can leave your
nail just clear just your regular nail
bed color and just lay these over top so
super super cute this is going to be the
tip of your nail here that's gonna have
the Panda on it last one is called laser
Tigers it's pretty crazy there there
there
Tigers with lasers shooting off of them
and this isn't one that you know there's
no way in the world you'd be able to
create this on your own nail unless you
were a crazy nail artist so I mean
that's pretty amazing to like go out and
have that kind of design on your nail my
only concern about these is I feel like
these would not fit on my nail maybe
I'll try these on let's go ahead and do
a demo and let's try these on impromptu
demo coming up in a couple of minutes
let's show you what's ripping the rest
of the box and then I will try those on
and see how they okay next up are the
tools okay
they sent a nail file which is essential
it's nice to buff your nails before you
put the nail wraps on so you can buff
and then you can file the nail off the
nail off the design off actually they
threw it and they threw in a little
panda mirror this is so super cute look
at this just adorable little mirror for
your purse very cute I think everybody
could use a little mirror here in there
and then this here this is called floss
gloss Ltd is the name of the company is
a pro nail lacquer in the color bikini
coral and what a beautiful color and one
that is so wearable for so many skin
tones and it looks like it looks very
thick this is probably going to be a one
to two coat polish based on the
thickness that I'm seeing running down
the bottle just really really cute
polish and I'm very excited to have this
very happy to have that so oh and then
here's a little orange stick this is to
help you push out the bubbles if you
have bubbles in your in your nail wrap
because you don't want the bubble cuz
the bubble is gonna make it tear so
let's go ahead and stop here
and we're gonna go ahead and try to
apply right
here are the nail wraps Ellen took off
one hand because I just did a nail
stamping tutorial and I really really
like the way that this looks so if this
doesn't look make me happy I'll probably
put this one back on but we shall see
this is all you need that's it okay
so we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna
tear off these babies and we're gonna
see which one is going to fit my pinky
nail now again not a nail artists nails
are real people nails they're yellow
they're chipped they even might even
solve a little blue on them that's just
real life my friends so you can see that
there's two sets and I accidentally
ripped through one you know it is what
it is okay
so let's go ahead and just take this one
and let's measure it up let's see looks
like this one is going to look good
right about there so it's got plastic on
both sides then I'm going to lay this
down on up my nail all right and let's
try to measure it up with my cuticle
which would be right there
press it down now you can use the orange
stick for this or you can just use your
finger I just like to use my finger and
press down now the most important thing
is to make sure there's no air bubbles
alright so now that it's pressed down
I'm gonna go ahead and file off the
excess and you can also trim this ahead
of time if you know your nail is going
to be a significantly smaller you can
trim it down a bit but since I'm not
trying to use the other half I wasn't
too worried about now I just kind of
bend it down a little bit and again this
is very soft which is a very good thing
because see how it beautifully conforms
to the size of my nail I mean it's just
beautiful it's perfect so then just
straight up 90 degree angle straight up
and down
I'm very gently just rubbing on this
super gentle and it comes right off now
people have asked me all the time if
I've tried jamberry nail's and I tried
them once I have a horrible experience
with them because I didn't do it right
but they might jamberries is you have to
set them and these you do not have to
set I guess you could tell that's a
tiger face I don't know let's just try
them all and then maybe we'll be able to
tell by the yak and good looking good I
mean that's that's pretty interesting
looking if I can tell it's a tiger
though I guess that one definitely you
can tell the tiger this one you can't
really tell I think that's one thing
scratching needs to keep in mind is that
you know people with short nails that
the patterns got to work for both short
nails and long nails it's got to be able
to work for so that's how that's looking
um honestly I don't I don't think I'm a
fan of this pattern I mean the only one
that I like is this one this one came
out really cool let's get up close okay
honestly I am really not a fan of this
pattern on my short nails the only one I
really like is this one that one I
really like a lot I think you can tell
it's a tiger it looks cool I feel like
these just look like a bunch of red
lines with an eyeball this one if I you
know it's a tiger you can tell it's a
tiger
this one still looks like an eyeball
with a bunch of lines I mean it just did
not translate well to my short nails so
what I want to do is I want to show you
on this nail the nail polish they said
alright this is so pretty I hope it
translates to the nail just as well oh
my gosh I'm in love with this look how
beautiful
Wow okay so it's definitely gonna be at
least a two foot polish and you can see
some of my blue remnants there that's
not so cool that's my fault that's not
their fault so that's one coat and I can
even leave that with this pattern I
could even leave that thumb there and it
was some wouldn't looked that bad
and like if you look at the other
patterns like I mean it matches with
that one say it goes with this one at
all but that's okay I don't think it's
supposed to go with all of them but you
know it definitely matches with that one
it matches with the tiger print very
cool all right I'm gonna go ahead oh
it's kind of drawing Matt that's neat
all right I'm gonna go ahead and put
another coat on very pretty so it's a
tad bit streaky but I think with the
third coat the streaks will go away just
gonna have to let it dry a bit before I
put the third coat on and hopefully
that'll take care of the streaks and
that actually looks kind of cool
I think this would definitely look
better on my ring finger rather than the
thumb though I had thought about it
ahead of time so it's still a little bit
streaky but that might be due to my
nails being not very nice right now like
I've got a big chip there that's not the
nail polish's fault but it's a gorgeous
color I'm really thankful to have okay
so overall review of the March scratch
box I feel like they still have a little
ways to go and this is coming from love
I appreciate scratch sending me this box
please don't get me wrong I'm very
grateful but I feel like it's helpful
for them to hear an honest review I mean
I just I feel like that the most usable
one is this one their whole theme was
empowering women I really don't see how
pandas empower women I can see how like
we could say that women are like Tigers
you know tiger mom I don't know like I
don't get the theme so they did give me
a choice of which month I wanted so
maybe that's my fault maybe I should
have picked a different box so maybe
it's just I don't know I mean I think
that the pandas are super cute I just
don't get the empowering one women thing
the other thing is the designs I think
are a little misleading in that you've
got to take into consideration when
you're
Reps how long your nails are and my nail
is only going to get the little panda
faces you're not going to really be able
to tell a lot about what they're doing
on for the entire wrap and the same
thing with the with the Tigers I mean I
I feel like only a select few people
have nails as big as these Tigers faces
I mean I guess maybe this one here this
one here I probably should have used on
my nails because its faces a little bit
smaller I mean I just I feel like they
still have a little ways to go now I'm
really really thankful for the extra I
feel like that the Polish is definitely
a way to go because I feel like
everybody can use more nail polishes I
mean everybody can use more nail polish
I don't care who you are like it's
really poppy so if you like these colors
then maybe you would totally dig this
and really love this on your nails I
don't know like I'd love to know what
you all think in the comments down below
what you think of scratch what you think
of nail wraps in general what are your
favorite brands I definitely recommend
scratch as a company I mostly recommend
going on and looking at the nail wraps
they currently have and picking some out
and buying them individually
I almost wish wish scratch had some kind
of build your own nail polish strip box
that way you could always make sure you
had ones that met your taste I think
that's where they really need to work on
is getting more designs that are more
universally appealing to a lot of people
you know but you know but I do thank
scratch so much for sentence to me I
truly appreciate it my critiques are out
of love I promise you and I thank you so
