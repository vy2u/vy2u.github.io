first scratch a subscription box opening
I am very excited about this because I
am a huge fan of nail stickers now this
is the thing about nail stickers though
is that they are really expensive
compared to nail polish you'll pay
anywhere from 10 for the cheaper ones to
1580 fifteen dollars but between ten and
fifteen dollars for a set of nail
stickers I've never tried scratches
before now the cool thing about
scratches they're designed by just
regular people they have a featured
artist that does the designs and I think
that's super cool because it's just you
know it's like relating to somebody and
somebody creates something and then you
buy it and I just think that's really
neat i will put all the information as
far as how much scratch costs and all of
that right there so that you know i'm
just going to go ahead and get into what
it is and it says joy the baker I guess
is the name of the the the Creator here
and this is the July box says thanks
goodness for summer here's how we're
going to roll splashes of water color
blue skies cucumber slices and daisy
accents that resemble the days when we
sat in from the TV and cried over my
so-called life yes gosh do you guys
watch that show with long good show you
haven't ever seen my so-called life
watch it on Netflix if you have netflix
it's amazing also get a recipe for a
drink a drink is a water watermelon
cucumber mint julep young oh I have to
try this that looks really good okay so
you open it up it looks like this and
then we'll be doing a little demo I'm
going to take off my rainbow nail them
so that I love my rainbow nails okay so
the first thing I'm seeing in here is Oh
Ruby wing I have another Ruby wing nail
polish these are they they're sensitive
to sunlight so when you go in the
sunlight they change color I have one in
pink it goes from light pink to dark
pink it's very bright actually so this
is the Ruby wing nail polish that I
already haven't got it off the Birchbox
website and i like it i don't think that
color contrast is super huge but i do
like it so I'm anxious to try this and I
don't have any bright
green polish that I like I have a
formula x 1 and I don't like it it's not
very opaque it's very weird and it looks
like it goes from a bright green to a
darker green so really excited to try
this yes let me do the drip test yep
nice and thick we're probably looking at
a one to two coat polish on this one I'm
pretty sure that this one is a 12 to
quit apologizing for full opacity really
truthful opacity you need two coats but
really under you can get away with one
especially we got nail art on it okay so
then we get a straw I guess this is a
drink you're drinking drink out of and
you get a little flamingo stirrer very
cool i live in the baltimore area and
there's a place called hamden and
they're really big into flamingos down
in hamden there was like I can't even
explain it I'll put a picture of the
giant flamingo right there that's down
in hamden so that fits in very well with
Baltimore and then you get a ama where's
this an orange stick that's that's
called book and then a nail file okay
and then now let's get into the nail
wraps oh my gosh these are so cute
daisies are my favorite flowers
specifically gerber daisies but I like
regular daisies as well I'll do
close-ups on these in a second and then
this one here oh my gosh that is so cute
and then this one is like a water
marbling so let me do those up closer
you can see okay so there are the daisy
so you put that over of plain polish so
I won't do that one to take someone's
going to be too big of a deal to do
today and then this one is the water
marbling that's really cool and then
this one I think I'm going to do this
one today because that's just really
stinking cute oh my god oh let's go
ahead I'm going to pack this up and then
I'm going to go ahead and switch to my
desk view so you can see me put on me
nail stickers
okay so I've got my hands I've got my
nail wraps I've got my file and I've got
my orange deck okay so open these bad
boys up so the concept is this comes
with one two three four five six seven
eight of them I unfortunately have five
fingers on each hand so you get to
choose based on you know how big your
nail beds are which one's work best for
you usually what i can do is i can use
these at least twice i'm going to show
you how well twice i'm going to show you
how I do that now hopefully this one
fits because I really like that one okay
so we're going to start off with this
one tear this baby off I know my nails
are yellow I paint my nails all the time
I don't have beautiful missjenfabulous
nails because i'm not you know i just
paint my nails all the time and they're
not gorgeous they're chipping all the
time and I realized that so I'll need
comments about that we're just going to
show you how to use these things cuz
that's something I feel like I do know
how to do so we're going to go ahead and
take this off I know this going to go on
my pinky finger take that plastic off
and back now I'm going to place this on
my pinky finger
just kind of gently press
like that
gently press and you can use the orange
stick to press down if you want I'm just
going to use my finger to smooth it
stretch it a little bit okay now I bend
it over my nail just a bit and I take my
nail file and I BAM cut it with the nail
file my arms will awkward cuz the tripod
but okay now that that's cut now we just
pull that off and we've got our
beautiful nail there we go that one's
done I'm going to take this edge off
here comes off come on
well that kind of stinks usually those
come off a little easier than that and
are easier to use on another nail ok so
now I'm going to try to put the same the
other side on this man
see it doesn't quite reach the edge
that's ok now I'm going to be looking
that close except for y'all
now I could take my orange stick and I
can kind of trim this year just a little
bit and there we go now what pinkies are
done okay I'm just gonna now that i know
i can use these for both sides i'm just
going to put this one aside and use this
one another time and use this one now
measuring these up to see which one I
think is going to fit me the best
see now I'm stuck because now this is
just plain white so now I need to decide
what I'm going to do here and I want to
break into that one kimball this one fit
here
maybe we're going to go for it
one thing that's good about these is you
can kind of reposition them a little bit
if you don't get it on perfectly the
first time it's kind of weird-looking
don't know if I like this particular
design the lemon and the cucumber
you
four down six to go
most nail stickers will easily separate
into a circular shape but for some
reason these don't so I'm just going to
try to cut them
you
so there we go all right for more
really flat is very important because if
you get wrinkles than they don't last as
long
don't
no making it worse
ah still going to work not the prettiest
nail in the world but it's still going
to work
yeah those are not pretty
what we'll do is we're going to put some
clear top coat on there so hopefully
that kind of doctors it up a little bit
but that one already wait because I was
freaking out I already have a chip in
that one so that's my fault that's
that's operator error and this one's all
wrinkly so hopefully I can fix those so
they don't look too terrible because
that doesn't look so good alright let's
just do the thumbs cry tears later
these are not meant for to use as a
piece so that's why they're I'm having
so much trouble with them I'm kind of
cheating the system by using them twice
my clouds are going to be upside down
well it's not going to be perfect
I'm not enough of a perfectionist to
care that much
doesn't look too terrible long it'll
look super close look too bad see how
I've got that big space right there
that's not good it fits on that side see
I don't know why it fits great there but
it doesn't think right there if so I
think I'm just gonna leave them and just
let them be that's the way they came out
and that's the way I'm just gonna let
him be and just hope nobody notices
right over there oh alright let's get
some top coat good old sesh AV seal the
ends very important on these things
silly ends and then shipping
all right that's it I think they came
out pretty cute except for my mistakes
they came out awesome all right so
that's how they came out yeah not
perfect but I mean that's just operator
error I mean and I could have been
really picky about it I could have made
sure i have a dark blue that's similar
to this color I could have painted my
nail that color and then put this on in
order to kind of hide it a little bit
and also i was being cheap by using just
the one strip of stickers instead of
both strips now i'm pretty sure and i
will double check for you but i'm pretty
sure that these will not last forever
like this i think they're sealed in this
package for a reason and i think that
eventually they do dry out so it's
important to use them relatively quickly
after you open the package i don't know
exactly how long their life is once you
open it but if i can find out
information about that i will put it in
the description below i'm also going to
put a little note here about how long
these stickers lasted on my nails so you
know about kind of you know what you're
dealing with i did a see on the website
that it is a thirty-dollar subscriptions
you get three nail wraps and then you
get the bonus extra nail polish or
whatever the bonus extra is for that
month so so that makes these ten dollars
for each nail wrap and that is extremely
reasonable if you go to the drugstore
and get nail wraps they're going to be
at least ten dollars so even though it
seems like it's a lot for nail stickers
that's how much they cost I mean that's
the going rate and you can get them for
actually up to $15 at the drugstore so I
mean what you're paying for is you're
paying for the nail art and for it being
able to just go right onto your nails
without you having to paint it yourself
so these are really nice for special
events or you know when you're when
you're going to the beach and you want
to have the extra cute nails or you know
you're going to a wedding or you're
going to you know whatever you got a
special event so they really are fun for
that if you have any other questions

below i'm going to put some information
