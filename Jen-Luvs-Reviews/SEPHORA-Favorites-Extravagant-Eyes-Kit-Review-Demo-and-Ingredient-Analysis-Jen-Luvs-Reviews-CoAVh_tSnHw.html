sephora favorites kits you get to try a
ton of high-end products at a discounted
price so today we're going to talk about
the extravagant I set and whether or not
it is right for you hello my friends it
is Jen back again for another review
today we're gonna be talking about so
for a favorite skits I love these things
I love once before it comes out with
these things they used to just come out
with the holiday time now they come out
with them a lot of times during the year
but this is the beginning of the Sephora
favorites craziness that happens at
sephora around the holiday season this
is the first one that I saw that I was
interested in now there are a lot more
available but you'll know I like to test
things for a while before i come on here
and review them for you so I have my
idea of how I feel about all this stuff
but before I tell you how I feel we're
going to go into what you get in this
kit I'm going to show you a demo of all
of these products going on my eyes you
can see how they work and then I'm going
to go into how I feel about the products
we're also going to go into product
ingredients possible dupes of these
products that you might be able to find
elsewhere and yeah I'm super excited
about this video so let's go ahead and
get started first thing is what comes in
this kit so when you open it up this is
how it looks you get some full-size and
some deluxe i sample products in here
these are the hood of beauty eyelashes
this of course is full-size you also get
an arse dual intensity on shadow in the
shade hemali ah i believe is how you
pronounce it right there that is what I
have all over my lids next you get a
caviar stick from Laura Mercier and this
one is in the shade plum this is a
full-size caviar stick you also get a
full-sized Urban Decay heavy metal
eyeliner and deluxe sized samples of the
next product so this is a deluxe sample
of the Smashbox 24 hour photo finish
shadow primer and a Sephora waterproof
eyeliner pencil and the Marc Jacobs
omegle ash and then finally from milk
makeup the eye pigment this is about
half size of what the
the regular milk makeup I pigments look
like so they say here that this is $42
United States cash or fifty dollars
Canadian it is a 134 dot us value or a
161 dollar Canadian value and the way
that they break that down is they do
take into consideration these are deluxe
I samples should they take the how much
product you get and they compare it to
the full size and that's how they
calculate your value but if you were
going to buy these in full size of
course you would be paying a lot more
it's very difficult to get a deluxe
sample of this at least that I've seen
I've never seen as well example this
anywhere maybe my Sephora play friends
have gotten one before but I've never
seen one i've definitely seen this as
it'll example places i've definitely
seen this I don't know if I've ever seen
the Smashbox as a deluxe sample so
depending on how readily available these
deluxe samples are to you and they cost
you a lot more to try these products cuz
you may have to purchase them in full
size before I get started with the demo
I do one let you know I didn't need a
transition shade so I broke into my
naked to Urban Decay basics palette and
use one of these shades for transition
this does not come in the set but I
really felt like I wanted to transition
shade so I pop this in here but this is
the only thing that I have on my eyes
today that are not in the kit so without
further ado let me show you the demo of
how the products went on my face
anyone
yo
yay
Oh
you
Oh
cuz ur now you've seen how the products
went on informs your opinions about how
they perform now I'm going to tell you
my experience from using them for a
couple of weeks how they performed for
me now the only thing I can't talk about
for long term is the hood of beauty
lashes this is the first time that I've
used them so i can't speak to how you
know they last for multiple uses
anything like that but i can say they
went on very easily they of course are
not natural lashes by any means they are
extremely dramatic so if you like
traumatic classic lashes these would be
for you the band's it looks like the
lashes are very attached to it they look
like high quality lashes they look like
they could stand multiple uses and they
were not difficult to put on the band
was flexible and I don't see any problem
with these or any reason why they
wouldn't be a good pair of lashes the
NARS dual intensity eyeshadows I've had
hit or miss with this formula some of
them I feel like are more pigmented than
others this one I feel like is a really
really really good one I feel like it
was I'm very nicely dry but it's pretty
amazing the foiled affect you get when
it's wet and it is just a fun Shane and
I feel like this is a shame that can be
used for all skin tones I mean I really
don't see anybody this wouldn't work for
if you have a very very light skin tone
you may want to kind of stick this on
the outer corners if you have eyes that
you don't want to look more deep set
other than that I mean this is an
amazing shadow lasting powers fantastic
lasted all day and I really liked it oh
speaking of that I forgot to mention the
eyeshadow primer so as you can see on my
lids I do feel like with powder shadows
I feel like that this definitely helps
with the pigmentation with the umph with
the pizzazz I've used these with this
with multiple different eyeshadows
through the past couple of weeks and I
do really like this eyeshadow primer I'm
not sure if it helps me to make it last
longer through the day I didn't really
see much difference there were days
where I put it on one I verse and not on
the other I maybe saw the slightest
little bit of difference with this as
far as longevity but nothing that's
super noticeable unless I'm like super
looking you know what I'm saying I'm
going to talk about the ingredients of
this one now
because I could not find a dupe for this
and the big reason why I couldn't find a
jeep for this is because it has done
method cone as the number one ingredient
which is an odd ingredient for an
eyeshadow primer I shadow primers
usually use other kinds of silicone
basis not dimethicone dimethicone is
usually used for face primers and it's
usually the second or third ingredient
down but it's the number one ingredient
in this so that was really really really
interesting dimethicone can cause acne
and people's skin so that's why some
people don't like silicone based primers
for the face but they use it in an eye
primer and I've never heard of anybody
having problems with acne on their lids
so I don't know I mean does it works
it's a nice primer but I just thought
that was a strange ingredient to put in
first but maybe it was a good move all
right ruin um we'll get into more fun
ingredient stuff later I've got a lot of
ingredient analysis stuff for you later
all that geeky stuff let me keep going
with the opinion a huge fan of laura
mercier caviar sticks I think that they
work fantastically they're very easy to
blend they play well with powder
eyeshadows and they're just a really
really really nice product this is one
that I've used quite a few times as you
can see it can go on very bold and you
can kind of tap it out with your fingers
if you want it to be deeper or you can
lend it out with a brush for a lighter
look and I really like this one a lot
it's so creamy so easy to use my friend
Lucinda that lives in Barbados loves
these things she's the one that turned
me on to them years ago and I absolutely
love this formula it's fantastic this
afore eyeliner support eyeliners are one
of my favorite favorite favorite
eyeliners of all time I really like them
a lot they're only ten bucks they last a
really long time on my lashline
waterline not so much they kind of
disappear but not in like a like a
seeping down your face looking like
someone punched you kind of look like it
just kind of goes away gracefully but it
does stay on the lower lash line like
you can still see it right on that lash
line giving a nice subtle look all day
long I don't really use these for the
upper lash line very often just because
i'm more of a liquid kind of person for
the upper lash line i did use it today
so you guys could see it but it's just
not my favorite kind of thing to use my
upper lash line but i really love these
for the lower lash line
alright the milk makeup eye pigment okay
I really want to love this and I think
that this would be really good as an
all-over lid color the big issue I have
with this is it doesn't play well with
powder eyeshadows it lasts forever and
it dries really fast so you have to work
quickly when you're using this and if
you want it all over your lid you're not
going to have a problem with it because
you're going to be able to just Pat it
on and go and it's just gonna be like
boo boo boo boo boo and it's going to
stay all day and it's going to be
amazing but if you want to like create
like an artsy look with this if you want
to have some wiggle room and blending
things this is this is not the product
for you I just found it really difficult
to to use with a complete look but I
will say that it lasts all stinking day
same thing with the laura mercier car
caviar stick last all all all day looks
exactly the same the end of the day as
it does the being day like these
swatches if I leave them on they will
stay on all day even through washing my
hands like I will have to take a makeup
remover to remove this it's fantastic
lasting power but just really difficult
to work with the lash mascara I did put
this on today even though I'm wearing
falsies because I wanted you to be able
to see how this performs I really like
the omegle ash by marc jacobs it is a
really nice mascara i like that it gives
me length and volume it's amazing it is
definitely one of my favorite high-end
mascara formulas but I'm one that I
stick to drugstore mascaras unless I
have to look samples like this because I
feel like my Maybelline lash sensational
is not noticeably different than this
one I would say that this one performs a
little bit better than that one but for
the price difference like I can't see a
difference unless I'm so so so looking
like it's just not worth the price
difference for me but it is a fantastic
mascara and I was really happy to get it
in the kit because i feel like it
performs fantastic it doesn't flake down
my face through the day it's easy to
remove it's easy to go on and it's just
a really really genuinely good mascara
and then finally the Urban Decay heavy
metal eyeliner if this is your thing
this is a good one I really like the way
that it goes on it goes on nice and
smooth you can build it up to more
glitter butt
you don't even really need to I mean it
really applies with a lot of glitter
just on one pass and then it doesn't
take long you know if you want to do
another pass it's going to get you even
more glitter but if you like this kind
of thing it's fantastic and it doesn't
leave any kind of fallout I don't see it
drifting through the day it just lasts
on there on your upper lash line it's
beautiful it's a really beautiful
product and I definitely enjoy it for
that day when I'm feeling low spike the
animal Oh glitter on my eyes it's just a
high quality product so do I think this
is worth it absolutely i mean and even
monetarily if you don't use the lashes
and you don't use the milk product and
you don't use the eyeliner this probably
adds up to still well over the $42 you
can pass on the other ones to more
dramatic people if you want to you can
wear them for Halloween but they have
really put a fantastic deal in this box
so now that I've told you just
straight-up opinion on performance of
product we're going to talk about all
the geeky stuff like ingredients if you
want to be blissfully ignorant about
what's in your cosmetic products or if
you don't care about other products that
are similar to these then i'm going to
say goodbye to you now and i hope you
enjoyed this part of the video but this
is where we're going to bring it down
we're gonna bring it down with the
ingredient the purpose of this section
of the video is to compare these
products with other products on the
market so if you've tried other products
on the market and you know you like them
or you don't like them you'll kind of
have an idea of whether you would like
these i'm also going to talk about the
actual ingredients of the product and
whether they are labeled as harmful for
you harmful for the environment things
like that so let's go ahead and start
with the caviar I stick by laura mercier
so the closest formula dupe that I found
for this is the Mallee ever color shadow
stick extra they have the same first two
ingredients and then they share five
other ingredients I have not tried the
extra version of the Mallee so I can't
tell you from personal experience but
formula wise they are similar the first
two ingredients are the same and that
first ingredient the cyclopentasiloxane
is the one that showed up on
environmental working group which is the
a ingredient analysis system that i use
it showed up as a 3 out of 10 for alarm
bells once you start getting into like
the six and seven range that's when they
start being banned in countries so it's
a silicon-based ingredient and research
in canada says that there are high
concerns and persistence and
bioaccumulation what that means is that
this particular ingredient seems to
bioaccumulate in wildlife an example of
this was when there was that big thing
about fish and mercury poisoning how
they realized that the mercury was
building up in the farmed fish and then
it raised all these concerns about
mercury levels in farmed fish especially
salmon so that is what bioaccumulation
is so this cyclo pencil siloxane is an
ingredient that can build up in this in
the systems and it's been shown in
wildlife to build up in their systems
the other ones are that more animal
studies showed two more firm a formation
and moderate doses and one or more
animal studies showed endocrine
disruption disruption and moderate doses
i don't know why i'm having trouble
saying that and then one more animal
studies show neurotoxic effects and
moderate doses so that is for the number
one ingredient that is in this so if you
do not like that if you do not want that
on your face you may want to skip the
laura mercier crayon e things caviar
sticks even though they work really
really well you may want to skip them
okay next up this is one of my favorites
the Marc Jacobs omegle ash okay I was
doing I was tryin to find formula dupes
for this I'm like how many mascaras out
there out there what are the chances i
may be able to find a formula do okay
i'm just going to show you this right
here right there is the omegle ash and
this right here is the new it cosmetics
superhero mascara i can't make this up
okay they share exactly in the exact
same order the same ingredients all the
way up through number 13 the exact same
ingredients the omegle ash by marc
jacobs and the new it cosmetics
superhero mascara I was like I couldn't
believe it ok and then numbers 14
through 21 are all ingredients that are
shared between them but they are in
slightly different orders then things
kind of start falling apart from there
and they become quite different but what
that tells
you is if you like the superhero you'll
probably really like this if you like
this you'll probably really like the
superhero because they're essentially
the same in the majority of the
ingredients on all the elastic stretch
stuff that the it cosmetics tent says
that it has are all in those bottom
ingredients there is a biotin ingredient
in the omegle ash but it's slightly
different and that one is included in
the cosmetics as well but like straight
biotin is only in the it cosmetics
there's some fruit extracts in the it
cosmetics there are some different kinds
of oils that are not in the Omega lash
there's collagen that's not in the Omega
lash but again they're way far down the
list I don't know how much collagen it
takes in a mascara to actually do
something but just know that there isn't
a whole lot of it compared to the rest
of the formula so now getting into the
down and dirty stuff about this mascara
and this goes with the superhero too
because all the ingredients I'm about to
talk about are also in the superhero so
that also has the slightest
cyclopentasiloxane that was in this so
the one I just talked about in this is
also in the superhero and this then we
have something called rice bran wax
corey's core zia sativa rice bran wax
and that's a number three and the reason
why that's on the list is because
there's a possible contamination can
start from pesticides in the rice so
it's wherever they harvest the rice from
and get the ingredient out of it it
could be contaminated with pesticide the
pesticides are very very bad but there's
nothing wrong with the actual rice bran
wax is just the risk of contamination
the next one is SD out alcohol for TB
this is number four for being an
irritant so on your if you put all over
your face it can cause dry skin I don't
know how much that would affect a
mascara but you can decide for yourself
how much it bothers you the next one is
try fan Allah mine it's a five it's a
strong alkaline substance used as a
surfactant and ph adjusting chemical
it's a human skin toxin or allergen
there's strong evidence to suggest that
it is a skin toxins and an allergen so
if the superhero bothers you or if the
Omega bothers you
maybe the ingredient you want to stay
away from and the last one in this that
raised red flags with the Acacia senegal
gum it's prepared from the dry sap of
the acacia tree it's a human skin toxin
or allergen there's strong evidence to
show that it was determined safe for use
in cosmetics subject to concentration
use or limitations so that may not be a
problem in the concentration that it's
in this mascara but just so you know
alright moving into some good news the
milk I pigment had nothing that raised
red flags yay and I also couldn't find
any dupes for it the NARS dual intensity
I shall also had no scary ingredients
yeah also could not find a formula tube
for that one either moving on to the
Sephora I pencil I did find a formula
dupe for this the julep I pencils are a
formula dupe for this this before I
pencils are ten dollars the juleps are
sixteen dollars so if you like the
juleps go for the Sephora instead
they're a better deal they do share the
first three ingredients in those orders
they also share every ingredient that's
in the Sephora pencil is also in the
julep I pencil but there are a couple of
ingredients in the julep that are not in
the Sephora the only ingredient that
raised concerns in this one was
something called pgp PG 18 / 18
dimethicone and it is at number three on
the scale contamination concerns are the
reason why this is here something f
called ethylene oxide which is a ten
it's a known human carcinogen and then 1
comma 4 dioxane which is an eight and a
possible human carcinogen but both are
banned for using cosmetics and it's just
something that could have possibly
gotten into some batches of this
ingredient it doesn't mean that this is
bad at all alright moving on to the
Smashbox i shadow primer everything in
here was good except for the talc that's
in here to help can be an irritant to
some people and also a contamination
concern for asbestos form fibers it's a
number three on EWG and i talked about
this how it couldn't find a formula tube
for this because of the dimethicone
that's in this and then finally the
Urban Decay glitter one thing I found
very very interesting is the ingredients
listed on this one are different than
the ingredients listed on the Sephora
website the ingredients listed on
Sephora website mentioned parabens this
one does not have parabens so I thought
that was really interesting so I guess
they reformulate it because they know
there are a lot of people that do not
like parabens in their products some
people are sensitive to them but this
one in particular does not have parabens
according to the ingredients on the box
the dupe that I found for this well it's
not really a dupe it's just kind of
similar was the NYX Cosmetics liquid
crystal eyeliner they share the same
first two ingredients and then they
share for other ingredients that are
similar so if you like the next ones
I've never tried the next ones they're
called the liquid crystal liners I've
never tried them but if you like them
you'll probably like these but if they
might be very very very similar I don't
know I've never tried them but if you
can get next ones instead of the Urban
Decay ones go for the next one's a lot
cheaper so I thought that was kind of
interesting that the formulas were
similar they're not the same they're
just similar as far as negative
ingredients for this we have propylene
glycol which is rated a 3 it's a small
organic alcohol commonly used as a skin
conditioning agent it's been associated
with it being an irritant and allergic
contact dermatitis which is a rash it's
also sometimes contributed to contact
urticaria I think is how you pronounce
that in humans and that's when someone
has an allergy to something so bad that
they have to take antihistamines or even
need an EpiPen for it like really bad
allergies so if you are if you have
contact urticaria you probably want to
stay away from this product mmm the next
one is poly ethanol it's a four on the
scale it's a preservative using
cosmetics and personal care products
it's restricted in cosmetic products in
Japan it's classified as toxic or
harmful but only in products used around
the mouth so do not use this on your
mouth if you get it and that's from the
European Union it's also classified as
an irritant from the European Union and
then the last thing in here is sodium
sodium hydroxide which is a three on the
scale it is a pH balancer it's also
restricted in the European Union and
it's classified as expected to be toxic
or harmful at a medium health priority
in
Canada so that's what's going on with
that so really and truly you know it's
it's gonna be up to you about how much
this stuff bothers you and whether you
want it on your face or not and if those
ingredients bother you of course you're
not gonna want to get this get you know
I mean it's your level of comfort with
things some people don't care about that
stuff they just kind of go on their way
about it i'm a person that I'm willing
to try anything with any ingredients
maybe that's horribly dumb of me but I
try things of all different ingredients
I try dollar store make up that has all
kinds of crazy stuff in it and it's not
something that terribly concerns me i
guess it's kind of like the smoking of
the makeup world some people smoke and
they're like ah people live 40 years and
you they smoke with their whole lives
and and they live till the be not till
they're 90 you know there's people that
believe that kind of thing and i guess
that's kind of my ignorance with makeup
as i just kind of let it be let it be
let it be let it be but if you're not
one of those people and you speak words
of wisdom you may not want to get this
so that's it for my review of the
sephora favorites extravagant eyes said
i hope you enjoyed it I hope you found
it unique and helpful and different I'm
trying to do things a little bit
differently because I am such a geek in
my heart and I find this stuff
absolutely fascinating so I'm hoping you
find it interesting too if you do deadly
