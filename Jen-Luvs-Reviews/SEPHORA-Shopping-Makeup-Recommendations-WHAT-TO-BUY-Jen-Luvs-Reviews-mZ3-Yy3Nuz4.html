sale suggestion a video I am excited to
share with you of my definite recommends
to you from the Sephora sale if you do
not know Sephora does have an annual 20%
off everything in their store sale last
year I believe it was 20% off for vib
ruses rouges which means that you had to
spend over $1000 at Sephora in the year
and then it was 15% off for VIPs which I
believe is $250 a year I'm not sure
Beauty insiders got a deal I'm not quite
sure so any details I know about the
sale as far as dates and all of that
will all be in the description down
below so what I did was I went on the
Sephora website and I just filled up a
shopping cart of all my favorite things
that are currently on sale at Sephora
and I'm just gonna read them all to you
now there are a lot of things that I am
NOT listing to recommend to you because
a lot of them I have not personally
tried there's a lot of things that I've
seen in our whatsapp and makeup facebook
group which is our community
part well part of our community there's
it's part of it but it's a big part of
it on our Facebook group there's a lot
of products that they all talk about
because I haven't personally tried it
I'm not going to recommend it to you I'm
only recommending to you products that I
have personally tried and really enjoys
down below in the description I'm going
to put different categories of products
so if you're looking for a specifically
for a concealer or an eyeshadow palette
or a lipstick I'll put timestamps down
below so you'll know where you can find
those specific suggestions so let's go
ahead and start with face primer so I've
picked out two face primers for you one
of them is silicone based and one of
them is not the first one is the benefit
Porefessional it is very well-loved in
the community it can clog pores for
people with oily skin so just be aware
of that but it's just a really nice base
for makeup I am wearing it today and I
really really enjoy it definitely makes
my makeup stay on longer
I do have normal skin so that's pretty
much all it does just gives a nice
canvas to start your makeup look off
with and then the second one is the one
that is not silicone based and it's the
Too Faced hangover RX replenishing face
primer this one is great for people who
do have oily skin or their their skin is
typically clogged by silicone based
products this does not have silicone in
it so
great for you rave reviews all over the
place on this product the only thing
about this one is it does have a coconut
scent to it so if that bothers you you
will probably not enjoy this product at
all going into foundations the
foundation I'm going to recommend to you
it to get it on sale is the hourglass
immaculate liquid powder foundation
mattifying oil-free I am wearing that
today I am not wearing a powder over top
of it I am wearing a highlight so this
shine right here is a highlight but I
don't have highlight anywhere else on my
face you can see what the finish is
without powder really like this
I love the liquid to powder look of it
it gives a nice satin finish without
having to set it with a powder and I
love things that help me save a step it
makes me super happy if I can save a
step in my routine the next one is a
powder foundation and this is the Too
Faced cocoa powder foundation I've had
this for a while really enjoy this for
just bumping up the opacity of my
foundation or BB cream or tinted
moisturizer or whatever I'm using it
just really just brings it to the next
level I do not enjoy using it on its own
I don't feel like it's enough and I feel
like it wears off very quickly when it's
by itself but layered over top of
something else it's wonderful if you're
someone who has one or two foundations
this is a great way to bump up the
coverage of those two foundations and
now you basically have four foundations
so really like that about it and then
the last one is the it cosmetics your
skin but better CC cream this is another
one that is absolutely loved universally
in the community whenever we talk about
foundations BB cream CC creams when
we're in the weekly chat that we do
every Sunday everybody talks about the
cosmetics CC cream I mean it's one that
very rarely do people have issues with
it's a less it's less coverage than the
hourglass one and it gives just a nice
evening of the skin tone without being
overpowering and it just leaves a really
nice natural looking finish to the skin
for concealer I was sad to see they
didn't have the Tarte shape tape I was
gonna recommend the Tarte shape shake to
you but they don't have it on the
website if you can find it in store I
don't know if they're selling in the
store and I definitely recommend the
Tarte shape tape for more coverage for
that intense covering of dark circles
blemishes things like that discoloration
if you want something that's a little
less intense the Sephora gel cream
concealer is really
really good but again not as much
coverage as you're gonna get with the
tart but still works very very well I
use it on my very light dark circles
works great for a minor discoloration it
works really really well right next on
the Sephora website they talk about
contours and highlighters so the contour
products I'm going to recommend to you
the first one is the Anasazi a Beverly
Hills contour kit it's amazing lasting
power is great works for lots of
different skin tones very easy to use
very easy to apply I love the tones of
these contour shades I don't really use
the highlighting shades a whole lot but
if you like a more subtle highlight
that's a great way to get a nice subtle
highlight or if you are truly just doing
a highlight just to lighten part of your
face and you're not looking for that
shimmer and shine it's a great way to
highlight the other one is the smashbox
step-by-step contour kit now this is an
exact dupe for the elf contour kit
that's like six dollars i think but the
lasting power on the smashbox is better
but it's the exact same color so if you
like the elf and you just want kind of
an upgrade as far as the longevity of it
then definitely go with the smashbox me
personally i'll just go with the elf i
don't care enough like i feel like i
wish i didn't have the smashbox
sometimes just because the elf really is
fine enough but if you want that extra
oomph of lasting power if you need that
in your life maybe you work really long
days you have really long school days
and you want it to last longer that
would be the way you might want to go
and then for highlighting palettes i was
also really sad to not be able to see
the Anastacio glow kids i couldn't
believe they weren't there they only
have the one holiday one and that one's
getting really bad reviews so i'm not
going to recommend that to you but i am
going to recommend the hourglass ambient
lighting palette the original one I've
also heard really bad things from the
community about the holiday one that it
just isn't performing like the typical
hourglass highlighter blush palette or
just in general like their products so
definitely the original one with the
three pans is where we're gonna go for
highlighting palette if you want
something that's a little more subtle
and give you a nice subtle glow but it
won't be like what I'm wearing today
like this it won't be like you know from
space shining blind and people kind of
highlight it's just a nice subtle
highlight and it's really nice for
people with textured skin mature skin
it's really really good for that because
it's not going to accentuate your pores
as much as let's say a Becca highlight
or an Anasazi aglow kit I have to face
powder recommendations for you and they
are both loose powders that's what I
prefer for a finishing powder that's
just me I don't prefer the press kind
except for the Rimmel stay matte and the
Milani one those two I really really
like but I haven't found one Sephora
that I personally prefer as far as the
press kind at Sephora I prefer the
mineral loose ones so the bare minerals
mineral veil is fantastic I thought at
last holiday season it's still one of my
staples in my collection I love it so
much if you want something that has some
fragrance has a little bit more fun to
it a little a little more interesting
effect to it you can go with the Besame
vanilla powder they do have a cute
little gift set that you get to try
three of their powders definitely
recommend trying that I have swatched
the other ones but I don't own them the
original one though is so fun it's a
great way in the morning to wake up and
just have this vanilla scent all over
your face for me personally I love that
if you're sensitive the cents go with
those bare minerals not the best maybe
but if you're not and you like that kind
of sentencing go with the Besame it's a
lot of fun they're both very very very
very very finely milled they feel really
nice on the skin leave a beautiful
finish I don't see much difference in
the finish it's really whether you want
sensit or unscented for brows I think it
just depends on what you like in your
brows if you enjoy pencil I have to go
with the Anasazi of brow Wiz but I also
have to tell you that the L'Oreal one is
pretty much exactly the same so you may
just want to get the L'Oreal it's a lot
cheaper than the Anastasio even on sale
but if you are cruelty free then you
want to go with the Anasazi because I
believe on a style use cruelty free
where the L'Oreal is not but it's pretty
much the same product the Loreal brow
definer I think is what it's called so
if you like a pencil I would recommend
that one if you like really really thick
like Instagram very defined brows the
honest ahzab dip brow pomade is
fantastic for that for that really sharp
brow now there's one that I have to
recommend above all others it is my new
holy grail and it's the benefit curb
brow I love the
bro I'm wearing it today love it love it
love it it's a it's like the dipbrow but
it's a little more subtle so it doesn't
go on as opaque so you can brush it
through you do need a spoolie with it
though so make sure you have a spoolie
but you can you know put it on like the
dip brow it comes with its own little
brush and then spoolie it through and
it's just so easy and it works really
really well and I love it that's my
favorite and packaging is super cute for
eyeshadow primer you can't go wrong with
Urban Decay primer potion but it's
really just what you want for your needs
the original primer potion is currently
on sale in the old packaging for ten
dollars so you've never tried a primer
potion that maybe some place you want to
go just because it's on sale and it's
the exact same formula it's just
different packaging the anti aging is
wonderful if you have aging lids when I
used it religiously for I guess it was
about two to three weeks I could
definitely see a difference in the
reduction of the fine lines on my
eyelids I know you don't believe me I
have fine lines on my eyelids but I do I
am I am getting closer to 40 I'm almost
there so I do have some fine lines on my
eyelids and I do feel like it does
reduce the fine lines but you have to
use it every single day to see those
effects and I do feel like as you put
your eyeshadow on the eyeshadow goes on
better because it's specifically made
for aging lids so that's a really good
one I used to recommend the one in Eden
but I found that the one from Ulta the
Ulta nude matte one is exactly pretty
much the same as the one in Eden from UT
out discolorations so I don't recommend
that one any more I recommend going to
Ulta and get that one I know this is the
for a video but I can't recommend the
Eden anymore I just can't in good
conscience
moving onto eyeshadow I am going to
recommend eyeshadow based on really what
I think are the best palettes sold at
Sephora and none of them are super new
we're going to start with the original
Urban Decay Naked palette The Naked 2
palette and the Too Faced chocolate bar
palette those three are my favorite
neutral eyeshadow palettes there's one
that's kind of a dark horse you know you
don't really see them too often
that's the Stila eyes are the window to
the spirit palette that's another really
really good one those four are all
amazing it's really just whichever color
selection is calling to you the most
I would recommend
all four of those they're all really
really good if you're looking for some
color I do have the Kat Von D one that's
out for the holidays but I haven't
tested it enough in order to recommend
it so far so good but I'm not quite
ready to say yes go out and buy it but I
would actually recommend the Urban Decay
alice-in-wonderland through the
looking-glass palette it's really fun to
play with if you have a ton of
eyeshadows and you're looking for
something unique to add your collection
that's something like you don't you
don't have it you don't have this I mean
I feel like this is just super super
unique to the world of eyeshadows as far
as the color selection I feel like it'll
be really fun to add your collection and
the packaging is really fun it looks
like a book so I keep it up on my makeup
table and it looks like I have a little
bookshelf and it's just I don't know I
love it I love the quality of the
shadows I have a full face tutorial and
it will demo and review I will link that
down below on the Alice Through the
Looking Glass palette it's a really
really good one another one if you're
feeling a bit adventurous is the buxom
build your own eyeshadow palettes if
you've never swatched these in the store
there's a shade called la la la lavish
that is the most beautiful iridescent
purple on the entire planet it's insane
it's so gorgeous there are a there are
ton of different shades to choose from
and you build your own eyeshadow palette
it ends up being the exact same price as
if you bought one of their pre-made
eyeshadow palettes you just get to pick
what colors go in so it's just a really
fun way to get new colors into your
collection that you may not have just by
choosing them you're on your own and I
have not found any quality concerns with
any of those that I own they're all
really wonderful the mats and the
shimmers there they're all fantastic so
definitely recommend if you want
something a little more creative now
getting into eyeliner the Sephora pencil
eyeliners are fantastic and they are so
underrated on YouTube nobody talks about
them they're so good especially if you
want to try a colored eyeliner maybe for
the lower lash line it's a great way to
try color they're 10 bucks which is
close to drugstore prices and they work
really really really well I like them
better than the urban decay ones I like
them better than pretty much every
eyeliner pencil I've ever tried they're
amazing they stay on my lash line really
well you don't stand my waterline
perfectly
but right on that lashline they will
stay all day and I love the colors that
I have the black works great too but the
colors are really fun to play with so if
you're looking to experiment the
eyeliner i definitely recommend those
and then for the top lash line if you've
never tried a pen liner this may be the
time to try one they're my personal
favorite for applying liner through the
top lash line I feel like it's the
easiest you don't have to worry about
dipping a brush and getting the perfect
amount of product the perfect amount of
product is already in your brush the Kat
Von D tattoo liner in trooper is a great
black also the steel out one is also
fantastic there I use them
interchangeably I bought them here and
there you do have to get rid of it after
about three to four months just like
mascara so you might just want to get
one and then you know make sure you're
you're you know being fiscally
responsible with your eyeliner purchases
unlike myself and and definitely be
careful with how many you're buying an
opening of those liquid liners but
they're really really really wonderful
if you want one that's a little more
budget not at Sephora the that you guys
know what I'm gonna say the Jessie's
Girl liquid eyeliner they sell it at
some Rite Aid's they sell it on Jessie's
girl calm you can also get it on Amazon
it's pretty much exactly the same as the
Stila and the Kat Von D but it's a lot
cheaper but you know it's whether you
want to get something from Sephora right
now cuz it's a for sale but I have to
tell you about these other things on the
side because I just can't I can't not I
have to tell you now going into mascaras
if I have I'm gonna be forcing myself to
recommend mascara sh t there's just so
many really good drugstore mascaras out
there that it's hard for me to even
recommend a mascara from Sephora for you
like the the Maybelline pink one I'll
insert a picture right here cuz I can't
think of it off the top of my head is
amazing there's a bunch of other really
really good ones if you have a
recommendation of a drugstore mascara
you can always leave it in the comments
below and then if you want to know some
read the comments below cuz the
community here is amazing they know so
much stuff so if I have to recommend a
mascara the blank mascara amplified is
really great if you have sensitive eyes
because what it does it's a tubing
mascara they do make drugstore 2d
mascaras but I've never tried one you
put it on your lashes and at the end of
the night when you're ready to take it
off you just take warm water and you
splash it on your face and it just falls
off you don't have to worry about
scrubbing or rubbing your eyes it just
fall
off and it's wonderful it's a really fun
experience if you've never tried a
chewing mascara this may be the time
with the blank it's really really good
for other mascaras the Lancome grandiose
is a really good one if you want a
luxury mascara
I love the wands it's really fun to get
it in the angles and it works really
well being all crooked like that it
works great and then the other one is
the Urban Decay perversion mascara that
one is really good both very lengthening
very volumizing I have little teeny tiny
baby lashes I got fake ones on today but
naturally I have very tiny little sparse
noting lashes my hair is just very thin
like my head hair my leg hair my eyelash
hair is very very thin so the fact that
I can recommend mascaras to you like if
I'm recommending them to you and you
have really long lashes
growph when you're gonna be set or
boyfriend you're gonna be set because
they work great on me so those three the
Blanc the Lancome and the Urban Decay
perversion one thing I forgot to mention
for eyeshadow the Urban Decay Naked 2
basics palette if you're looking for
just a go-to palette that you can use as
a supplemental palette with other
palettes it's a great way to have
transition colors and brow bone colors
to go with some of these crazy palettes
that you may be purchasing that just
don't include those the look that I'm
wearing today is with the jus vyas place
nubian palette this palette for me is
missing the cream brow bone color and so
I can always reach into my Naked 2
basics to grab that just as an example
and the same thing with the The
Masquerade it just doesn't have a
fantastic transition for me so I can
reach into the the Naked 2 if I need to
so it's just a really nice palette to
have just as like a just-in-case kind of
palette and it's a great time to get it
on the sale okay for cheek products it's
hard for me to recommend high-end cheek
products because I use most of the cheek
products I use like that I love or like
the balm they don't sell that on on at
Sephora I really love the makeup
revolution blushes they don't sell those
at Sephora so it's hard for me to
recommend but I have tried a lot of the
tart tart blushes I do really enjoy
those but I also feel like their
formulas kind of a hit or miss so you
know buyer beware some of them aren't as
good as other ones the Too Faced love
flush blush I have tried that in smaller
versions but I've never bought a
full-size of it so far so good on that
formula and I've heard great things from
the community but that's kind of what
I've got there also if you don't own
coralista by benefit that's a really
good one if you like that shade so I
mean but blushes I feel like I'm kind of
lacking on recommendations for blushes
for you I'm sorry I have a couple of
bronzer recommendations for you then
lips and then we're done so with bronzer
bronzers the Too Faced chocolate Soleil
pink which shade works for you so the
milk chocolate is for very fair the
regular chocolate is for light to medium
medium and then the dark chocolate would
be like medium to deep so they work
great though they're really nice
bronzers the other one is a benefits
hoola is also really really good I have
lots of lip recommendations if you are
new to lip products to color on your
lips definitely recommend the sugar
fresh sugar little bombs they have gift
sets around the holidays it's a great
way to try a bunch of different shades
on your lips to kind of get into wearing
color on your lips because it just gives
you that nice little wash of color
without being overpowering they're very
hydrating it's just a really nice
product so definitely recommend those
gift sets the bite Beauty formula is
really really good the amuse-bouche line
is wonderful I recommend those I also
recommend the Marc Jacobs
I've have one I only have one because
they're a little bit pricey the new
nudes sheer gel lipstick and I think
it's like eat cake something like that
something about cake I love that formula
really really nice very hydrating and
also I've really enjoyed the Too Faced
melted chocolate ones if you like the
shades there they do have a very strong
chocolate pudding kind of scent though
so if you don't like that just be aware
of that and the one that's called
something chocolate diamonds I think has
a lot of like silver glitter in it if
you don't like that don't get that one
but there's there's ones that don't have
glitter in them so it definitely stay
with the the chocolate milkshake the
chocolate honey or the chocolate
cherries I don't own the chocolate
cherries so I can't vouch for it but I
do have chocolate honey and chocolate
milkshake and I really like those a lot
I am one that really enjoys a whippy
liquid lipstick formula I do not enjoy
the drawing ones if I had to pick a more
drying one
I would definitely say the Kat Von D
ones but honestly they are not my
favorites that's just a personal
preference I know a lot of people love
them they're just not my favorites my
favorite of all time is the bareMinerals
Gen nudes that just came out I own
pretty much every shade thanks to FC
points and then I purchased a ton of
them as well for my bare minerals review
I'll link that down below as well if
you're curious about the bareMinerals
gen nude line I did a whole video on the
lipsticks the liquid lipsticks and the
lip glosses and I will link that if
you're curious about the line but the
liquid lipsticks are amazing the they
smell like chocolate pudding they go on
so easily I'm wearing the one in Xyz on
my lips today I wouldn't say they're
hydrating but they're not drying and
they have a nice lasting power not
fantastic but a really nice lasting
power to them you know they'll wear off
but they're also more comfortable than
let's say the Kat Von usually the steel
is the steel is dry my lips out so bad
like I can't even take it and the Kat
Von D's are a little bit better but not
a whole lot better and the Anastasio
ones I would say are somewhere around
the Kat Von D as far as the dryness of
them but I don't really enjoy those
either because I just cannot stand the
drying it's like there's people that can
wear super high heels I can't do that
like I can't just fight through the pain
but I feel like some people can fight
through that dryness of the liquid
lipstick I personally can't I go with my
Gen nudes so that is it for my Sephora
recommendations I hope you enjoyed it if
you did and you have a friend who's also
shopping the Sephora sale or you're
looking at somebody looking for gifts
from Sephora for a friend or for
themselves definitely share this video
with them so that they can get
suggestions and I want to thank you so
