you
hello my friends welcome my final review
and thoughts on the drug store palace
today about a month ago I purchased
six-stroke store pallets I put out some
videos with some finger swatches of them
gave you my first impressions on them
I've now used them for about a month and
have some final thoughts on them so
we're gonna go ahead and start with my
least favorite and move to my favorite
okay so don't hate me on this because I
got it i something's got to be my least
favorite and my least favorite of these
is the blush nudes by Maybelline okay
now this is not a bad palette okay I'm
not saying it's a bad palette but it is
my least favorite I find it the hardest
to work with of all of the palettes well
this one is probably tied with another
one as far as it being the hardest to
work with I feel like the shades here
look more pigmented than they actually
are so like when I swatch them they look
like they're going to be uber dark but
they're not they don't they swatch
beautifully but actually applying them
to the lid there they don't apply as
deep as they look in the pan or in the
finger swatches they blend out very
quickly very easily of course you can
make any of these shadows pop by using a
you know white cream eye pencil such as
Nyx's pencil and milk you can use some
of these wet I would not recommend using
these wet I do feel like you're going to
get hard pan on them I don't feel like
they would react well to water I can
already see hard pan kind of developing
that's when you get like kind of a film
over top of Shadows I can see that
happening already on a few of these
shades and I've only used it you know
five or six times and and honestly like
I just don't like the way these blend
together they kind of blend away they're
just kind of weak overall you can work
with them you can make them work you can
make some beautiful look with this
palette but it's work is what I'm saying
it's not easy to get the looks that
you're going for unless you're going for
something really natural so if you're
going if you're like a high school kid
and you just want to get
a nice neutral look for school that's
not going to be too much this is a great
palette for you if you are someone who's
not accustomed to wearing a lot of
makeup and just want a little bit of
color this is a great palette for you if
you are a hardcore makeup addict and you
have high-end palettes and you're going
to compare this to them mmm this one is
not going to do it for you again not a
terrible palette but not a great one
either it when I compare this to an
urban decay palette no no no no I would
not that is my personal opinion please
don't hate me all right moving on to my
next least favorite it's probably pretty
time and it's the hard candy sassy eyes
palette
you know the Sam the the hard candy
palettes the packaging is fantastic gets
that hard packaging so that you know you
can travel with it and it won't get
damaged which is really really nice but
it's the color combination that I don't
like in this I don't feel like it is a
complete look in this palette I mean
you've got a couple of darker shades but
like this one is kind of difficult to
work with it is very pigmented it's very
black very pigmented it's very hard to
blend so I have not really been enjoying
that this one is very pretty but um it's
probably my favorite in the palette it's
kind of a muted gold
it's very pretty this one here it kind
of sucks to be completely honest I don't
have a better word other than sucks for
this it's got some silver glitter in it
that does fall out it blends away when
you try to use it it's just not an
enjoyable shadow to use and just the
color selection in this palette I'm just
not personally a fan of this one isn't
bad either but this one right here this
purple comes off very chalky and powdery
this matte shade I am NOT a fan of it
just it's not the best palette I just
would I wouldn't recommend this one
either I feel like this one honestly
this is I probably like less than the
blush nudes just because it's hard even
harder to work with because of the shade
range I think you have more choices in
the blush nude then with this one now
just a little bit about the eyeshadow
primer I was not a big fan of the
eyeshadow primer I didn't feel like it
increased the longevity of my shadows I
didn't really like the way it felt on my
eyes I don't really like the primer it's
just not my thing
the
minor however I really really did enjoy
it on my lower waterline it did run down
but as far as upper lashline I felt like
it did a pretty decent job for what it
is is it comparable to high-end no but
it is a really nice drugstore
inexpensive we'll say it's a very nice
inexpensive liner so you know but this
is definitely my least favorite of those
all right moving on to my next least
favorite we're going to go into the
lapel it new to and I know a lot of
people love this and I think part of the
reason why I don't love this is because
of my skin tone I think that this was
intended for darker skin tones for a
reason this let me just say both of the
lapel it nudes the shadows are wonderful
I think they're the highest-quality
shadows of all of these palettes as far
as quality as far as blend ability as
far as usability things like that I
think they're high quality the reason
why I am pooh-poohing this palette is
because not of the color range but of
the the lack of dimension in the palette
if you kind of glanced at you can see
they're all very similar toned except
for this one this one and this one are a
little bit later but there's nothing
light enough for me to use as a
highlight I like a very light lid with a
deep crease and this just does not do it
for me when I put an even darker skin
tone ladies you'll have to tell me
whether this is the same for you when I
put like these shades together it turns
into mud you can't even tell the
difference between them because the tone
is so similar so what I have to do in
order to make this palette work is I
have to pick one or two of these shades
and then mix them with other either
single shadows or shadows from other
palettes when I do that I love this
palette but as far as a complete palette
complete look I do not like it at all
so that's the way I feel about it and it
makes me sad one thing I will say though
is this brush is really nice I was
shocked how much I love this brush oh
and the other thing about this packaging
is it gets smudges on it really really
easily fingerprints and smudges galore
on this thing
back to the brush this brush is actually
really so it looks like it's very small
and useless but it's fantastic it really
gets in the crease and it applies a
shadow beautifully it's a nice message
by far the best drugstore brush I've
ever gotten in a palette I mean I don't
even know I've gotten a brush in a pal
before but I love using this and I will
continue to use this I don't really use
punched of applicators that much of know
I know I know a lot of people love them
and have a lot of successful sponge tip
applicator
personally I'm just you to go with
makeup snob I'll admit it I'm a makeup
snob and I don't use sponge dip
allocators I'm honest all right I admit
it when I have faults I'm it it I'm not
proud of it but that's a fact I do love
this little brush though I love it if
you didn't own any other eyeshadow
brushes and you've got one of these
lapel 'its and use the brush you will be
just fine it will the bigger your lids
is going to take more to get it on there
it's gonna take a little more work but
it's a really nice these three are the
three I would recommend okay I know that
the glare is killing my camera angle
alright it's killing the lighting here
but the hard candy smokey eyes the hard
candy natural eyes and the L'Oreal lo
palette one I can't pick between these
three as far as which one is my favorite
because really it's going to come down
to personal preference now I will say
right off what I compared these to my
high-end palette and the answer is no I
don't feel like any of these are the
exact same qualities my high-end
palettes now I did compare and I know my
French asked over jammed Beauty 89
compared these two Too Faced
um palette to face shadows and I believe
I compared this one to the Kat Von D
interstellar palette now swatch wise
absolutely they swatch just like
high-end shadows but when you work with
them when you apply them the eye they
are more work can you get the exact same
look absolutely but it's going to take
more work to just be prepared for that
then if it doesn't come out exactly like
Nicole Guerrero's you know naked3 look
or make it to look or whatever just know
it may not be your fault it may be the
palette so let's just kind of go through
these very quickly and to show you
what they are so you know whether
they're right for you the smokey eyes
palette is really for just that it's for
smokey eyes I can see this being
beautiful for darker skin or for lighter
skin people that really enjoy that deep
a dramatic eye look there isn't a lot of
dimension here to work with so well it's
it's kind of got the opposite issue as
the palette to wear it's got light and
it's got really dark and there isn't a
whole lot in between so you're gonna
really get that smokey eye with that pop
of white in the corner or that you know
I mean it's just you're gonna have to
pull some neutrals from somewhere in
order to really make this come together
but the quality of them is fantastic the
four drugstore for drugstore for a
drugstore eyeshadow palette and for how
cheap this thing is I think it's $8 most
places I paid knowing most places it's
eight I would definitely recommend this
I think that it's really fun to play
with especially if you've got some
neutrals art in your collection that you
can kind of mix and match with it is a
really fun palette to play list so this
one is a good one the other one I really
like is the hard candy naturalize
palette and I'll show you what that one
looks like and this one I think is the
easiest ah I think this one is the
easiest to work with of all of the hard
candy palettes I know what the primer
fell out but you've got a nice range of
those light mid-tone and deep shades to
play with again it is everything just
going all over the place just just let
things fall just fall everywhere let
them fall out but it is really
relatively easy to work with compared to
the other ones if you are enjoying
neutral looks or even there's some
glittery kinds of shades here now be
aware that this one does have some
fallout these glitter shades do have a
bit of Fallout but you know you just
have to pack on the color make sure you
tap off your brush when you use them and
they'll be fine you just kind of have to
just accept that's part of using that
color but the rest of them are very nice
they're very fun to play with and I will
continue to enjoy using this palette but
honestly my absolute favorite of these
palettes is the L'Oreal appellate nude
one
I am in love with this palette it is by
far the best drugstore palette I have
ever purchased ever use the pans are
ginormous let me just say that the pans
are ginormous the color range is
gorgeous you've got really light tones
all the way to your mid-tones to your
deep tones and everything in between I
just love the range in here they're fun
to work with some of them are a little
harder to work with than others this one
is beautiful but it is comes off a bit
powdery these matte shades are gorgeous
though they're very well done and I am
truly enjoying this and it also comes
with that brush that I really like so if
I were to recommend any of these as the
best it would be the L'Oreal the palette
nude one yes and these are the American
releases there were there was another
release of while cutting or a couple of
releases of a couple of different
L'Oreal Allah palettes in other
countries but these are the u.s.
releases so that is that again
fingerprints are not good but you know
it is what it is quality wise this is my
favorite so in the end when we have to
wrap this up I just want to make sure
you understand that even though I am
recommending these three palettes just
making sure I'm clear I do not think
these are the same quality as high-end
shadows and I'm sad to say it I wanted
to say that the same quality but I don't
believe they are because they are harder
to work with but you can achieve a lot
of the same looks you get with high-end
palettes with these less expensive
options so dupes no so good still able
to use still be able to create some
beautiful looks absolutely and that's my
final thought on those palettes so I
