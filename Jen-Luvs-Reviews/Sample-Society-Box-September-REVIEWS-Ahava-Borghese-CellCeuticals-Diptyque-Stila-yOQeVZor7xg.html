three boxes to share with you for my
beauty boxes and my subscriptions that I
got this month so this video is going to
all about sample society now I decided
to wait to do the review for the sample
society box until I had tried everything
in the box because that way you can know
not just know what's in the box because
there's a gazillion videos about what's
in the box but what I thought of the
actual products after using them for a
few weeks so I have tried everything
that was loud I have tried everything in
this box and i'm going to show you what
came in it now it's of course destroyed
at this point i will put a picture he'll
of what it looked like when i originally
got it first thing that jumped out at me
was this big sample giant sample of this
cell suitable by a medical skin
treatment extremely gentle skin cleanser
now let me give you a little rundown
about what's going on my skin if you saw
my 40 questions for you beauty questions
video I talked a little about skincare
in there and I admitted to you on that I
don't typically wash my face because bad
things happen when I wash my face since
then I have done a little research on
that and I want two tries to start
officially washing my face with soap um
but I I needed something like this this
does not make me break out it does not
make me dry which is unusual so I
definitely might be repurchasing this
depends on how much the full size
actually I can tell you with the full
sizes the full size is at $35 I don't
know if I'm going to be spending thirty
five dollars in the cleanser that I'm
not sure
I actually need but if i decide that i
need it i think i would buy this one
because i liked it um it doesn't smell
like anything which is kind of nice and
it's like a clear i'll put some way it's
um whoo Oh whoo bubbles hey it's like a
clear enough you can see that it's very
clear instant like running down my hand
oh that looks kind of disgusting but um
but yeah it's like a clear jelly gel
like um it's not tacky or anything yeah
thumbs up favorite of the box i think
well maybe not my favorite but we're
definitely a positive review on this one
next up but i saw was this a Hava
purifying mud mask now i tried this you
can see that i tried this and this did
make me break out um right along the
sides here I got some weird things going
on and on a like a little time complete
right I'm 34 years old I don't get
pimples anymore um and this definitely
gave me some I mean it wasn't obnoxious
but I will not be using this I will be
passing this along to somebody that will
use it it's like a gray out if you can
see that but it's a gray color and put
on the hands you can kind of see kind of
health at muddys on it doesn't ever
really dry like mud masks usually sorry
like my mess usually do which is kind of
strange um doesn't has a little bit of a
muddy kind of smell a dirt mud kind of
smell but it's not obnoxious it's very
faint very light smell but yeah so I
will not be repurchasing this and I will
be passing it on maybe it'll work better
for somebody else this was the perfume
it's like a French fancy $150 full-size
perfume um this out smells kind of nice
I mean it's a little I had to describe
sense i'm not good at this it's not
usually wear perfume
I mean it's not offensive it's nice um
I've definitely I wore it but nobody
noticed it so honey come here and smell
this perfume kind of smell like bug
spray it does kind of smelling bug spray
I don't you can see it yeah it does a
little small bug spray a little bit yeah
this is a no this is enough well not we
went up here we would not be purchasing
that from fifty dollars so what happened
on the Stila smudge crayon now this
thing is so weird there's what it looks
like um I tried to use it as an all-over
lid color it did not work for me um I do
like it as like a to do like my bottom
waterline let me show you a swatch of it
so I guess you're supposed to like color
on your eye with that I think that's too
dark for me to color on my eye I did use
in my crease once it was fine it was
kind of nice but I'm not in love with it
I don't think I'll be / i will be using
this but i don't think i'll be
purchasing a full size of it that is oh
the best thing in the box oh my goodness
it's in my purse it made the purse it's
that good it made the purse alright I'll
grade back now I've heard you can get
this at costco um I haven't actually
checked that out I do have a costco
membership but it's this board Gazi
borgess well I don't know it's it looks
almost like Bologna the way that its
spell but it's like bogus be lip gloss
and the color is in fuel a love this
stuff I mean when I first put it on it
felt really sticky and I was like oh
this is gross but it smells like
cherries let me show you what it looks
like
look how pretty that is I'll get closer
yeah I love it I'm really liked it a lot
it's nice and glossy and um it is a
little sticky but I think it's worth it
it stays on a lot longer I think cuz of
the stickiness so this was my favorite
thing that I got in that box these two
things made the fifteen dollars
definitely if I got things like this all
the time self society I would be so
happy to favorites by far so that's the
review for sample society to thank you
so much for watching coming up next this
beauty box 5 mad love Zumba</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
