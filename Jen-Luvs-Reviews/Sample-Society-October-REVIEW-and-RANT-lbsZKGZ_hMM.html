month again but not that time of the
month but the time of the month when I
talk about my beauty boxes so this is
the first in my three box series for
october and this one is going to be
about simple society and it just makes
me feel very rich and rough day to say
sample society here is a beautiful black
box is that you get with your civil
society okay that's enough of that I'm
getting annoyed with myself okay um but
anyway sample society this month kind of
stunk um I will tell you that right now
I did try everything in here I believe
ya did okay there was one win in this
box and I will get to that let me tell
you about his boss all right okay first
thing is this a Roma ecology clean and
fresh scent and it smells very clean and
fresh it does not smell like anything I
would wear on my body it's mostly
something I would spray on my sheets
fortunately my friend Kenya hi Canada
wants this she enjoys the smell she
likes to smell clean and fresh um maybe
because she works for NASA and she's
around like boys all day that's no bad
or something I don't know and she likes
to feel like she can smell clean I don't
know um but yeah this is going to be for
Kenda she enjoys this it smells like
like laundry detergent she can have the
next thing in zip simple society box was
this Jane Iredale tant Asia tanning
lotion sample and this thing I don't
even know what they were thinking
putting this in the box I guess maybe
they didn't realize how little of
product was in this and when i get a
tanning sample i want to be able to do
more than just like my right cheek would
be nice um but yeah I first of all look
at this ok I use this one time on just
my face just because I I felt like I
would need
it but look look watch see how much I'm
squeezing it see how nothing is coming
out look still nothing I'm squeezing
still nothing look still nothing I use
this one time here comes here comes some
more look still nothing look still
nothing I use this one time there you go
finally we get some product coming out
okay and let's show you what that looks
like okay orange hollow orange hello to
orange and not to tan ill ill just hear
what I wasn't oh well okay this is gonna
go in the trash as soon as this video is
over because um it's orange ok but I
will tell you it did not make my face
orange it didn't it did nothing after
one application of this I was a little
irritated with a sample maybe they gave
me a little more of a simple I would
have been able to try it more than once
so I could actually see whether it was
actually worked or not but yeah no no no
on the Jane Iredale Camtasia not
thrilled with them and what what's crazy
about this is when you give a sample
like this am I gonna pick up another
Jane Iredale product no I'm not because
I was so disappointed in this another
big fail of this box was this Erno
Laszlo New York formula 39 repairable
okay now I hate to be complaining about
this but i did pay fifteen dollars this
fox so i feel the need the right to that
i can complain a little bit okay first
of all look how tiny this is and i'll
tell you why i'm so mad at the the full
price of this having help those who buy
this is two hundred and fifty dollars
like real dollars a 250 real dollars and
there's no directions on it at all it's
just like the little like use this
within 18 months not for individual sale
distributed there's no ingredients ocean
nothing this year direction so i had to
look up online to see what this thing
even was cuz on the card it didn't even
say so what i did was i looked online
and it looked like
just a face cream so when I decided you
since I had such a little of it and my
biggest areas of concern on my forehead
right here why wrinkles and my under
eyes they kind of get these like creases
here that bug me I put it on my eyes and
it made my eyes breakout like I've never
had my eyes break out with my eyelids
turned red like I'm not even kidding
they were like maroon eyelids 118 eyes
darkest I'm a room but like red they
were red and they had bumps on them and
it was creepy I should have taken a
picture what I didn't know on this I
would not recommend this maybe it's just
because my skin sensitive but definitely
not for 245 dollars maybe I just didn't
read the directions well maybe it's not
supposed to be for your eyes I would
hope that maybe I read the directions
wrong and this is all ripped apart
because i used it i used it today um i
gave my daughter a little halloween
sighs laffy taffy in the car and her
hands were all sticky so I was about
what a good time to use my urban
essentials lab and hotel let ok so I
open this up I'm driving I open this up
and I just smell the smell and I'm like
holy Lord that is like the strongest
smell and it was in my car I had to roll
down the window i was like aunt LYLAS
like my little girl she's forced I can
smell all the way back here like she's
like in her little booster seat oh my
goodness that smells crazy like we're
just both freaking out about the smell
and i don't know i don't know maybe I
just don't know what lavender smells
like maybe I haven't smelled and well
this is not smell like lavender me it
smells like I saved the hotel leden here
so that I could smell it later then I
just had a little laffy taffy on and
it's not like it had like dirt on it I
know what to call that very alcohol
smelling alcohol mixed with dirt mix
with flowers just terrible smelling
absolute terrible and it was so
incredibly strong like Arsenal so bad
and as soon as I opened up my bag that I
had this in I just smelled it mmm new
thing
you may be if it wasn't a difference not
maybe wasn't like a food smell like a
chocolate smell maybe everything good or
like us like banana mm-hmm that would
have been good but lavender now the big
win okay win but fail okay this is a win
but a fail I'm of the mind set the most
shampoos are exactly the same exactly
the same you could buy swab or you could
buy Bumble and Bumble or whatever I've
never tried that so don't put me on it
but you could do any of these high-end
shampoos you know and they're all pretty
much the same thing okay this Oscar
blondie pronto wet instant of Alma's
volumizing shampoo this stuff okay this
made my hair so amazing like I'm not
even kidding it may my hair so volume
eyes and beautiful and it was sleek and
just gorgeous absolutely I love this
stuff when I my only complaint about
this is that the smell of it howto
smells like lemon pledge yeah like lemon
pledge dipped in sugar yeah pretty much
exactly the same you can see the first
time that I used it was the video where
got the big old hoop earrings you can
see how pretty my hair was in that video
like I'm not kidding I'm not trying to
brag on my hair or anything but my hair
look good in that video my hair is not
usually look good you can tell I did not
use it today it's flat I did not use it
today because I'm trying to save it and
this is why I'm trying to save it
because um the beauty bar website can't
get it from Oscar blondie you go to
Sephora website they don't have it
nobody has this stinking shampoo anymore
I don't think I I'm that I'm gonna run
to ulta and see if I can find it but I
think they're discontinuing it why in
the world will you give a sample of
something that's gonna be discontinued
you can't buy anymore I guess they're
trying to get rid of them or something
but I'm very sound about that because I
really wanted to buy this and I can't
find it anywhere sabor doesn't sell its
for online doesn't
it um I don't know I'll figure out
something I'm sure I could be I could
find it somewhere on amazon or someplace
like that but just the fact that I've
been finding it difficult to find this
and it when I went to Sephora tonight
they said that they thought that they
were discontinuing this so I'm trying to
like savor my drops yes I'm not using it
everyday um but I loved it I absolutely
love this shampoo so I'm really sad
about that so anyway not so happy with
the sample society box on the whole this
month a lot of big huge huge huge poop
who fails in this box so maybe next
month will be better last month was
awesome maybe next month will be better
I'm hanging in tight with it I'm going
to keep going with it and hopefully
they'll impress me next month because
supposedly it ships out November first
so I'm looking forward to that mad love
and I will see you in the next video
which will be my glam bag AKA Ipsy bag
video I'll are you I'll see then
