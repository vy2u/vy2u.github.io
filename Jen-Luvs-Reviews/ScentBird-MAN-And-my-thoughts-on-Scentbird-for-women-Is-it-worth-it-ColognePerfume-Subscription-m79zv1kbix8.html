get the same bird you're gonna fall
asleep on me sure I'll just spray this a
lot and it'll wake you right up
hello my friends welcome to a joint
review of the subscription service sent
burn Sanford was kind enough to contact
us and out all for John a free month of
semper to find out what he thinks of it
I've previously received semper for
review and yeah I love it I liked it so
much that I got a subscription to what
you do is you go on to the website make
it up make an account and you take a
quick little quiz and they ask you I
think it's like five or six questions so
it's not a whole lot of time and
basically it's just to kind of get an
idea of like what sense you might kind
of like I ask you stuff like where would
you rather be and it's like a picture of
a serene beach and there's like a deep
forest and stuff like that so and then
after that what it did was it gave me a
whole recommendation of the sense that
they thought that I would like and you
know you can read through them you can
read the descriptions of them and all
the top ones in the description sounded
awesome so I went ahead and picked one
and they sent it to me this is a pretty
neat little canister here so you twist
it and it pops up and then the atomizer
pops out and then you and you can spray
it you know either onto your wrists are
onto your neck and then whenever you get
your refills it pulls out and you put
your new refill inside here so the one
that I got was from burberry and it's
burberry brit rhythm do you know how
much you get in this it's slightly less
than a rollerball so if you go to the
store and buy a rollerball you're gonna
end up spending anywhere from twenty to
twenty-five dollars for a rollerball
size but it comes to your house and you
know it's it's pretty awesome I'm a huge
set bird fan like like really and truly
it's not just because they sent it to me
for review like really and truly like I
mean I got a subscription to it even
after they sound one to me for review I
like the packaging because you know I
can throw this in my gym bag I can throw
this in a book bag in my car something
like that it's not going to fall out
it's pretty sturdy packaging and even
though our packages are very similar
it's very unisex like that doesn't to me
look you know too feminine or too
masculine so it's kind of nice in a way
I kind of wish they would distinguish
like you know this man's / cologne and
this is a woman's perfume pink ones at
one point but they were like limited
edition okay so I mean but that's just a
small critique I mean it's not really a
deal breaker by any means when you once
you subscribe you pick out your list of
perfume so it's never like you don't
know what you're getting you always get
to pick and what I did was I just picked
out like six or eight months ahead of
time to make sure that I always had one
lined up and every one small hear about
any perfume I'll get a new sample and a
subscription box or I'll go into a into
a store and I'll snow one like I had
recently got I I got they sent me this
one recently but I had smelled in the
store giorgio armani see and i really
really liked it and i wanted to try it
on my skin for a significant amount of
time because when you spray something in
a store and you just do it one time you
may not really know over time whether
you like it and they wear off by the
time you see people that may be able to
tell you whether they like that scent on
you so it's nice to have it you know for
a good amount of time and honestly I
have never gone through one of these
it's supposed to be a month's worth of
perfume but I've never gone through one
even my very first one which was
ironically burberry brit i still have
some of that left not much but i still
have a little tiny bit of that left so
they last a really really long time and
i think i'm pretty sure that when you
dude dude that's why giorgio armani see
you mean face hold up to impact it did
hold up to impact but we don't want to
do that man you scared me if you sign up
I believe you get one month for free i
will put information about that down in
the description as well as a referral
links that we may have and a link
directly to set burning case you don't
want to use a referral link now let me
ask you a question what happens if you
get a cent in your life
man I don't really like that can you
send it back yeah you're wet you stuck
with it said burn I like the idea of
having a random selection pic i think i
would sign up for that instead of like
going through and like picking a whole
queue of stuff i think it would be cool
to have it both ways to be like yes i
want this for the next six months or to
be like send me random things right like
like that and and also don't have your
real profile online so all they would
have to do is just pick a set that fits
into that profile yeah yes I mean it's
not like they would be like totally just
guessing but I don't like the idea of
like getting a variety of things because
you know you might try something that's
you know something that you would have
never picked you know like other other
products that I've gotten that I've read
the description of and I'm like wow that
must be really weird but then you get it
and you smell it on your skin you're
like oh man that's yeah that's really
awesome this month is from burberry and
it's burberry brit rhythm and i can tell
you what the description of that is it's
an iconic fragrance sexy and provocative
brit rhythm is inspired by the
xhilaration of adrenaline of live music
and electric energy of the crowd the
scent mixes electric notes of fresh
basil ver vania spicy card mom and a
shot of juniper berries with black
leather patchouli and cedarwood and you
like it the result is a nice smelling
cologne I like it no it smells very
manly like it's definitely got like a
man smell like there's there's nothing
feminine about this thing at all and
it's funny because when you pick this
one ironically burberry brit was the
very first separate perfume that I got
so I thought that was kind of funny and
burberry brit the woman's one smells
amazing like it's got the perfect mix of
fruity and floral it's a really really
nice scent so it's interesting that they
really nailed it on the masculine and
the feminine with those two sets which i
think is pretty cool um like Jennifer
was saying when she I mean she's been
raving about sent bird for months she's
had a subscription and I'm like oh yeah
that's cool you know I get a couple
other subscriptions as well but I never
really was
like I should get one of those too
because actually I don't know that I
ever realized that Sanford had a man
subscription he didn't they just came
out with it oh well really i got was one
that and it just saw on the separate
website that i had never seen before i
got Clinique's happy heart and I this
must be new at least new to separate it
was not new in general because I'd never
seen all there before and I read the
notes and I was like oh that sounds
amazing the notes on here are water
hyacinth cucumber mandarin orange
carrots and cassis um you know honestly
the only thing I can smell in here is
flowers I don't smell any orange
mandarin orange and I'll smell any
cucumber I don't smell any and carrot I
don't know what those particular flowers
smell like but it just smells like
straight up like a bouquet of flowers
and I don't know I'm more of like a
fruity floral person so this one's a
little strong for me I probably would
not buy a full-size just because it
doesn't match me but if you like really
floral scents no probably like this it
doesn't smell like an old lady gramma
floral it smells like a classy beautiful
floral but it's just not my purse so
overall semper thumbs up thumbs down I
think we know what we're talking about
yeah definite thumbs up I dig it yeah me
too i'm with you definite definite
recommend for the set burn so yeah i
mean like i said i like the fact it i
can throw this image in bag there's some
a truck um I definitely because you know
I don't always get ready here in the
morning you know I'll get ready i'll
take the kids you know i'll go to the
gym and then you know so if i have
something i can take with me something
portable and something that's not gonna
