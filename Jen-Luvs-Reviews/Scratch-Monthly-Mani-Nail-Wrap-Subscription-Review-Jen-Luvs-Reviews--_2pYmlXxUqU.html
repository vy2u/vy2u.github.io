box opening now I had no idea Scratchy
was gonna send me another box so if you
all feel like you want to see these
monthly I will continue to them if not i
will email them and be like you know my
subscribers ain't digging a they don't
really care about it so i just send them
to me every once in a while or don't
send me at all or something but y'all
let me know whether you want to see
scratch more often a scratch is a
monthly subscription for nail wraps you
usually get nail wraps you get some
other a little extra goody and then you
get like uh you know different things to
apply you get like an orange stick and
nail file stuff like that so I think
it's to get twenty dollars a month and
last month's I absolutely loved I loved
every single print in it I used almost
all of them I have not used one of them
these will be kind of fall themed ones
because I'm kind of done with summer I'm
back to work so I'm hoping to see some
fall stuff in here that's how it looks
on the inside get a little car that says
share your mannie's by tagging go
scratch it and scratch mmm be wherever
you tag people so i'm suing facebook
twitter instagram and places of the like
cool little dotty dot paper which is
what normally looks like at least i said
last month here is the card inside
there's a cute girl on there with some
very pretty lipstick and some cool
aviator sunglasses it says i spy DIY
do-it-yourself the designer for this
month is someone named jenny from i spy
DIY we got three and nail wraps actually
let me just show you instead of reading
it and it just talks about her
inspiration for the box she's super cute
isn't she adorable she looks so happy
I'd be happy to I was decide on a
scratch of hogs alright so the first
thing I see in here is it says daily
charmer and it's a little mermaid charm
with a little star let me show you so
that's what that looks like I can't
imagine that going on my nail does that
go on your nail oh look sorry about see
look at look at my bacon nails I just I
wanted to have bacon nails okay so
anyway back to the mermaid there's a
little cute little mermaid
there and oh there's more than one more
there's a mermaid and then they're stars
in shells cool ok I will definitely use
the Stars a shelf I don't know if I my
nails are big enough to use a mermaid
though ok so not super excited about the
mermaid but the shove the stars and the
shells are cool so that's that and the
next thing I see are some little
glitters here they're like hexagonal
would you stop braun at each other my
cats are hungry they want their dinner
is super late at night and I haven't fed
him yet so I'm gonna call hurry up and
excuse me I'm just gonna hurry up and
finish this video feed on hey go away go
away mmm they're like hexagon glitters
um I guess you call him glitters and
they're like a mermaid looking color
they're like purple and green you know
me zoom it I'll sumit you guys can
decide what color it is that's the color
that it is and you all could decide what
actual color that is cuz it's hard to so
I'm not quite sure really how to use
these i'll have to look online and see
if there's some tutorials on how to use
these or what to do with these sub never
use anything like this but they sure to
give you a lot of them I don't know
maybe just take tweezers and just place
them if you all know how to use them
y'all could help me with that that would
be awesome alright so we got three sets
of nail wraps so this is rap number one
and this one is looks very Mexican to me
it's very uh you know reminds me of a
tex-mex restaurant like powder they
might you might see on the walls that's
a little arrowheads there and some you
know the little stripy guys those are
super cute and then the next ones are
very very beachy we've got this be
chiefs and kind of color and then the
bright pop of blue and then these have
little seashells on them I'm not really
fan of this one it looks very plain to
me I feel like it's something that I
could do on my own except for these
little guys I would have more
appreciated something clear with designs
like this then to have these because I
feel like I could paint this on myself
and then the last one is super cute
you've got some sugar skulls Day of the
Dead something I could never paint
myself I love this pattern around the
outside this is one definitely I like to
cheat and use both sides this is what I
probably wouldn't be able to do that
with really like that one a lot I will
totally rock this way okay there's still
a couple more things left
box I see some nail glue that must be
for the little hexagonal little guys and
four or maybe they're you know what
they're probably for the mermaid and the
shells interesting i've never used nail
glue before believe it or not so any
tips would be appreciated a little nail
file to help you with the wraps and then
a little orange stick to kind of make
sure all the bubbles throughout that's
one thing with nail wraps you really
have to be careful of is there's no
bubbles and you got a bubble in it
you're gonna have a hole in it real soon
so making sure the bubbles route is very
very important and then there's this
little cute little bag not like i need
another little bag but this is super
cute just a little throw in little bag
keep the little goodies in like keep you
out whatever you want in it it's got
little kitty cats on it down here i
don't know if i will use this maybe when
i do like a giveaway i'll put people's
goodies in it and before i strip it out
this is definitely super cute it's just
not something i personally would use so
alright so let's go ahead and do a
little summary of what we got in this
month scratch for twenty dollars a month
got the mermaid and she'll little charms
there we got the hexagonal mermaid
looking glitters there we got the three
sets of nail wraps we got the little
tex-mex looking ones we got the boring
kind of sort of boring shell ones I wish
they spice these up a little bit i mean
i get i don't know i don't know why
anybody would want plain ones maybe you
guys can explain me why anybody would
want plain nail reps I guess if they let
us longer or whatever you would want
plain ones but super duper amazingly
cute sugar skull pattern this is
probably my favorite thing in the box is
this one here I don't know this one's
really cute too and then we got the nail
glue the nail file the orange stick and
the little bag so to me I feel like this
is worth twenty dollars just because the
nail wraps themselves are definitely
worth over twenty dollars but yeah I
mean you're not going to be able to find
three sets and nail wraps for twenty
bucks unless you're at big lots or a
place like that and those things
honestly they do not last very long the
patterns are way cuter than the one and
the ones I've ever found at big lots
were you know Walmart places on sale I
know you can get some fur on sale but
these patterns are so much thinking
cuter at least these two are very much
cuter than the ones I've seen it
discount so that's really what you're
paying for and I personally think it's
worth twenty bucks to you whether you
want nail wraps or not that will decide
whether you think it's worth twenty
dollars or not so I liked it well thank
you so much for watching if you enjoyed
