one thing and one thing only well one
thing with five things in it I don't
know if that counts but it is the o this
mis'able favourites bee bee buzz BB
cream sampler I was so excited to get
this because I don't know why I totally
bought into the whole BB cream thing we
got foundation which is like a full
coverage medium to full coverage can't
really see freckles and florals and all
that stuff but can look a little cakey
if you don't get the right kind if you
don't get the right kind for your skin
all of that then you've got tinted
moisturizer which is very very light
coverage only covers up a tiny tiny bit
and then you got BB cream which falls
somewhere in between there depending on
which ones you get now a lot of the
drugstore ones that I have tried are
very much closer to the tinted
moisturizer they don't really provide a
whole lot of coverage at all I have
found with these these do provide more
coverage than my drugstore ones so I
want to tell you about these that maybe
you can decide whether you want to try
this kit or maybe you just want to try
one or two or whatever you want
of these so my first big complaint about
this is that they only make it in one
skin tone and I just think that's kind
of messed up I think that about half the
population of the United States would
not be able to use this which kind of
stinks and I'm hoping that Sephora did
well with this this year with the one
skin color and maybe next holiday season
that will come up with more than one
skin tone so when you when you take it
out of the package it ends up looking
like this and you open it up and
everything's in there now of course it's
all disheveled in there now because I've
used everything in the kit okay the
first one I want to talk about is the
Stila stay all day 10 in 1 HD
illuminating beauty balm it just
basically says that it's it's
illuminating its high definition
whatever that means I mean my nose is
gonna have definition I don't see how
this hopefully do I really want any like
pimples or whatever to be high
definition is I don't know if that's um
you really want to advertise on a face
products this one does have SPF 30 in it
and of course we all know SPF is very
important to have even in the winter
time so I'm gonna go ahead and put just
the tiniest bit on here because a little
bit of this stuff really does go a long
way you can see the consistency of that
and how it is dripping just the tiniest
bit but it is quite thick I'm blending
in all the way honestly I liked it it
was fine but I don't feel like it's
anything that I would want to break the
bank over it did have that a little bit
of illuminating factor to it I don't
know if you can see the little bit of
shine on there it might just be because
it's wet as well but I did notice that
my face did have a little more do eNOS
to it when I use this even when I use
the powder and I'm one that really
prefers a more matte look on my face so
it says water-resistant eighty minutes
what does that mean does that mean you
can be underwater for 80 minutes and
it'll like still work if I'm under the
water for 80 minutes I don't think I'm
be worried about my BB cream but yeah I
mean it was fine but I definitely I
don't know I'm glad that I tried it I
will use it I enjoy it but I'm
definitely not gonna buy the full size
of this one the next one I want to talk
about is the boss CI I think I'm saying
that right BB cream broad-spectrum SPF
27 and this one is supposed to be
lustrous flawless finish hydrates firm
soothes diminishes the appearance of
pores fine lines and uneven skin tone
while providing long wearing natural
coverage and conceals imperfections and
well again I'm only going to put the
tiniest bit because I'm not trying to
waste this stuff that I'm only doing it
on my hand but you can see this one is
also very very very thick grab that one
and this one is a little bit darker on
my skin then the last one but it blended
in very nicely I was able to use it this
one I felt like was not as thick of a
consistency as the Stila but I did
really enjoy it it says self adjusting
shade maybe that's why it worked out
well for me but I didn't feel like it
had all of the claims on here that it
said I didn't feel like it minimized my
pores I did feel like it concealed
imperfections it was a light to medium
Brij bbcream I did enjoy it but again
not something that I am going to run out
and purchase now so far we're doing
pretty well okay I'm definitely able to
use those I'm not going to purchase them
but doing pretty well on this one I was
actually the most excited to try and I
liked it the least it's the dr. jart
premium BB beauty balm multi action
skincare makeup and SPF 45 you'll see
right away why I don't like this but I
don't know if you can see but it's like
gray
it's got like a gray tone to it I mean I
don't you know like it just looked
horrible on my skin it made me look like
someone that was dead that was made up
to look like they were wearing makeup I
mean it was awful
on my skin tone I mean just gray and
awful and even when I blended it in it
still gave me this like dead look and
there was nothing I could do about it's
like and I didn't have time to read you
my makeup so like that whole day I just
looked felt self-conscious that I look
like I had this horrible makeup on so no
I would not recommend this dr. jart one
at least for anyone that's my skin tone
it doesn't say a color on this at all
so I know it says it's made in Korea so
maybe people of Korean descent this may
work better on but um no not did not
work for me at all I know my two
favorites were the Too Faced tinted
beauty balm Multi multi benefit skin
care makeup I really like this one this
one's in cream glow and I'll tell you
why I like this one I'll show you kind
of what that looks like and you can see
the difference in color there I also
like the applicator tip I like the ones
that squeeze out like that rather than
the ones that have the thick opening
just because I feel like it's neither
it's cleaner and I felt like it matched
my skin tone really well it was very
it's very very very creamy I just in
really enjoyed the way it felt on my
skin I felt like it hid my imperfections
very well it was light to medium
coverage just a really really nice BB
cream I would consider purchasing this
in the future if I was in the market for
a BB cream I might reach for this or the
next one that I'm going to show you
which is the Smashbox camera-ready BB
cream and this one is in SPF 35 and I
have
the one in light is the one that came in
here now I have not opened this yet
because I haven't decided whether I'm
going to keep this one or use it for
giveaway and the reason why I wasn't
sure is because I did get one of these
in my Sephora favorites kit and I knew I
was I had just had a feeling I was gonna
love it so I took the big one out of
there and then saved the smaller one and
have not opened it yet
so I'm just gonna use this one to show
you instead since this one is open this
one was awesome
love love love love love this one and I
think the reason why I love it is
because it really is closer to a
foundation but what a lighter like a
true medium coverage foundation
there is no cakiness to it like you get
with a regular foundation I'll go ahead
and blend that in again the same
creaminess as the Too Faced just really
really nice I did like this one a little
bit better just because I really felt
like it hid my imperfections just a tad
bit more than the Too Faced but honestly
I would take either one they're both
really really good I enjoyed both of
them and I'm very very thankful to have
both of them I'm going to be very very
sad when this one runs out and when this
one runs out I do have a backup which is
super nice I'm very excited about that
so overall do I feel like this was worth
twenty-five dollars to me I feel like it
was because I feel like I found some
really good favorites and the Smashbox
camera ready and the Too Faced beauty
balm really really happy with those so
glad to have tried these I may have
tried this dr. jart one and actually
splurged and got it and that hated it so
that saved me some time the seal and the
Basia one I'm happy to have the samples
but I'm just I'm not digging on those
but these these definitely these two I
was very happy with so they they're
about on average about 0.3 4 ounces of
product in each one of these now if you
buy them individually you're going to be
spending over $30 for just one of them
and those are typically one else so you
get like an out a little over an ounce
and a half of BB cream in here for $25
and it's all high-end so I would
definitely say that this is totally
worth it if you are my skin tone or
somewhere close to my if your if your
tan skin tone or anything darker I would
not recommend this thank you so much for
