hello my friends welcome to my review of
the very loud Sephora favorites bronze
bears all kit now I showed this in
what's up and make up a few weeks ago
and I told everybody that it was sold
out and I was very sad about it and now
all of a sudden it went back on and I
got a ton of emails and tweets and
comments on my Instagram that it was
back and everybody was saying please
just review it even if it's not around
please just review it I am going to be
reviewing it for you today but I do want
to tell you there are some things that I
like better than others in this set so
we're gonna go ahead into the good the
bad and the just okay in this kit
there's also gonna be a little bit of a
giveaway going on in here so let's go
ahead and start off and we're gonna go
from left to right and then down on
these products so the first thing
pictured here is the chocolate Soleil
bronzer and I still have this in the
packaging because this is going to be
part of the giveaway I do already own
the chocolate Soleil bronzer one thing I
can say about the packaging in this is
that they have definitely gone down in
the quality of the packaging they're
giving us a cardboard package versus
this used to be the packaging they would
package the chocolate Soleil bronzer and
when they did the mini so I'm just gonna
go ahead and swatch this one for you
since the other one is going to be
forgiving well you can see it is a
little bit on the warm toned side so
maybe not the best bronzer for
contouring but it is a very nice bronzer
for warming up your face a very very
pigmented when you go ahead and do a
little bit of a brush swatch here so you
can see how it applies with a brush
which makes a huge difference there you
go so you can see it's pigmented it goes
on nicely but it's definitely not going
to be so overpowering that it's going to
you know overtake your face so as a
product I really enjoy the chocolate
Soleil bronzer it is famous for a reason
it does have that
cocoa powder sent to it that two-face is
famous for and I definitely recommend
this product if you're looking for
something to give you a glow not for
something you would want to contour with
alright moving on to the next product is
the NARS lip gloss oh my goodness I
really really like this lip gloss and
this is in the shade super vixen
go ahead and swatch that for you here so
that's what that looks like and I'm
gonna go ahead and remove my lipstick so
that you can see what it looks like on
alright that's as much as I can get that
lipstick off that's the NYX matte
lipstick and it lasts forever
it's a very smooth lipgloss it doesn't
have a lot of stickiness to it it's got
if my hair were to go into my face right
now which which I have course tied up so
that it doesn't go in my face and I had
a hair mishap earlier with my curls
secret so it's just curly in the back I
didn't feel like looking like a poodle
for the video so is any way if I have my
hair down it went into my lips it would
probably stick into my lip gloss but it
doesn't feel sticky on the lips I feels
very very smooth and it just gives a
really nice shine it does look like it's
got a little bit of a shimmer to it but
I don't really well I guess it's there a
little bit on my lips hmm a little bit I
am gonna show you this on top of the
other lip product that's in here in just
a minute when I show you that lip
product but overall NARS makes fantastic
lip glosses are they anything amazing
that I thought you just have to run out
and get no but it is a fun gloss and it
is a good quality gloss and I do enjoy
it okay next up is my well tied for my
favorite thing in here this is the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector pressed and
this one is in opal oh my goodness the
hype is real the hype is real now my
holy grail highlighter is the the bombs
mary lou manizer it blends into the skin
even better than the mary lou manizer
it's just let's take a moment as we
appreciate this just submit I need a
bath okay just breathe just breathe as
you look don't stop breathing Holly just
huh just gonna use a fluffy eyeshadow
brush just uh well it's kind of fluffy I
don't know this is what I use don't find
my highlighter I don't know what other
people use this is what I use kind of
show you how it looks with a brush
I mean just just uh I have no words for
the beauty of that no words so I am
wearing that as my highlight today and I
just there's just there's something
about a good highlighter that just makes
you just I just
mmm-hmm I love it I love it I love it I
love it I love it will I buy more
probably not because I don't need them
but if I were to buy more highlighters
just because I just ran into some money
and just wanted to buy some highlighters
I would definitely invest in more of
these this is this is just it's amazing
wipe this off because we got Morse
watching to do so moving on next on the
box we have the nail polish by formula X
and that is what I'm wearing on my nails
today it is a two coat polish it is a
nice polish it goods that does not go on
streaky goes on very very smooth where
time is typical for a Polish for me
that's about two to three days without
chipping and it's it's just a nice it's
a nice creamy nudie kind of color and I
like it I do feel like it transfers to
the nail a little bit darker than it is
in the bottle let me just kind of show
you up close okay so as you can see that
the tone on my nail is slightly
different than the tone in the bottle it
seems a little bit darker a little bit
warmer on my nail than it is in the
bottle but overall just really really
happy with this polish and you know it's
just a good polish did you run out and
get it I don't know if you really like
the shade but it's nothing magical it's
just a really good polish all right
moving on across we're gonna go with the
eye shadow next which is tied for my
favorite thing in this kit and I really
feel like between these two products
you're definitely getting your money's
worth for this kid just just these two
alone there are there's another one in
here that I really like too that I think
pushes it over the edge but this is the
Urban Decay eyeshadow duo in half-baked
and twice that is what I'm wearing on my
eyes today I've got the I got half baked
in the middle to the outer corner and
I've got twice baked in the crease got
something from the lorac mega Pro in the
corner and then my brow bone just to
kind of blend everything out but the
main colors on my lid are the half baked
and the twice baked so I'm just gonna go
ahead and
my eyes again so you can see what it
looks like really really really really
really like these eye shadows they're so
easy to blend they're so creamy I just I
don't I don't even know what else to say
other than this is totally just they're
both fabulous and so let me swatch these
babies for you okay so there's half
baked and there's twice baked you can
see that shimmer on there beautiful
shimmer I'm now gonna get out this
synthetic brush that I got in my
fabfitfun box from Oh from and just
apply those with a brush one time I got
criticized for using too fluffy of a
brush so we're gonna use a nice flat one
maybe people like flat brushes better I
personally don't but you know I'll go
with what the masses say all right here
we go so there is apply with a brush and
this is no primer for half-baked okay
and then this is twice baked with a
brush no primer there we go again I
can't even praise this enough just a
gorgeous gorgeous eyeshadow duo they go
together very very well and I am in love
with us moving on the next lip product
is the bite lip product what is this
thing called this is the bite Beauty
high pigment pencil in Madeira Mandara I
believe this is very very very very very
very nude so I wish that they had given
one that was more of like a maulvi nude
or a pinky nude like so I just feel like
that would have fit more people I feel
like I'm less you're extremely fair this
is might look a little bit weird I have
but there is a way to work with it
actually let me take off my lip product
I'm gonna take off the lip gloss yeah
wrap alright alright we're gonna apply
this and then I'll show you what the
NARS looks like on top of it all right
here we go
what's going on here there's a buzz drop
their food
so there's that I I don't know it just
it's too it's too nude for me it's too
flat let me back it up so you can see it
at normal view I don't know I just feel
like it's like that dead lip look and
it's just not flattering on me I don't
like the way it looks so let me show you
what it looks like with the nurse will
also on top and hopefully that freshens
it up up enough Norah's gloss on top can
you see my face scan using my bangs zoom
it in on my eyeballs I'm over here
camera I'm over here come on over here I
know thank you alright
see how it kind of brightens it up a bit
and makes it a little less dead face
looking so I feel like the gloss makes
it wearable another thing you can do is
like let's say you have a really deep
shade of lipstick and you feel like it's
just too intense for that day that's a
really nice lipstick to mix in with a
darker shade to kind of just ease up the
intensity a little bit you know what I'm
saying so I definitely think it's a
usable lip product if you're gonna use
it for that purpose I think that it's
wonderful I love the creaminess of the
product the staying power is pretty
typical I don't feel like it stains my
lips but again I mean who's to know when
it like is so light you know it's kind
of hard to tell but I mean where time is
about you know until you eat or until
you wipe your lips you know anything
it's nothing magical or fantastic but as
a standalone I don't like this product
but mixed with other products I do
really enjoy it okay
so next up moving down here is the other
product that I do I actually already
have a sample of this I got it as a
hundred point perk I believe from
Sephora where I got it as you know one
of those add-ons that you get when you
checkout at Sephora so this is the tarte
the sculptor i'm going to show you mine
this one is mine and then the other one
is going to be forgiven and hopefully
you like it better than I do so this is
the one for giveaway this one's mine you
know put the one for you in there okay
I really wanted to love this and I don't
love it and let me show you why
so let's swatch ooh do I have any place
to swatch let's swatch up here okay
so there you go looks gorgeous and looks
beautiful as soon as you apply it I mean
just when you initially apply it it
looks fantastic but then watch what
happens as you blends it's like gone it
leaves just a small trace of a color so
if you are just getting into contouring
and you want something that you can get
a slight slight contour you know
something that's very everyday wearable
and you have a very light skin tone this
may be a good product for you light to
medium is pushing it a little bit I
think for this being a functional
product unless you really just want a
super super light contour that only
really you're gonna notice
you know what I'm saying I I don't like
this product if they had different
shades of this then I think this would
be a winner but I just feel like the
shade is not doesn't have enough oh you
know what I'm saying doesn't have enough
pizzazz so you know yeah yeah dang last
thing here is another product that I
really really loved and it's this
Sephora I pencil in cocoa I am wearing
it on my lower lash line today and I
love this eye pencil and I just really
like Sephora's eye pencils in general
I've never had a bad experience with one
it does not run down my eyes I do have
normal skin I don't have particularly
watery eyes I just kind of have normal
everything so if you have particularly
watery watery eyes maybe this won't work
for you but I feel like it stays in my
waterline for quite a while stays on my
lash line for the entire day really
enjoy this product I again will swatch a
and this one we can just do rampe see
how dark and beautiful okay let's give
it a second to set and then we'll smudge
it a bit so it smudge is really nice but
then doesn't blend away this product
does have a little bit of a bronzey
shine to it so if you don't like that
you won't like this but I think it makes
it absolutely gorgeous to have just that
hint of bronze in it so that is the
Sephora favorites bronze bears all set I
over all love love love this kit I think
is definitely worth it I mean if you
think about if you're paying $40 you get
one two three four five six seven you
get eight products in here for $40 so
that means you're paying five bucks
apiece for them especially for the Urban
Decay eyeshadow and the Becca highlights
a lot of people in the reviews are
absolutely loving this NARS lip gloss
even more than I do chocolate Soleil
bronzer is of course fantastic the bite
is just the shade that's kind of rare
the sculptor is a note for me but maybe
good for later skin tones the formula X
polish is nice not a must-have but nice
and the liner to me is phenomenal so
definitely to me worth the $39 forty
seven dollars in Canada they say that's
a hundred and nine dollar value but but
overall this is definitely a win for a
kid if you can still get it I
recommend that should do so that is my
Oh whoever wins this giveaway is also
