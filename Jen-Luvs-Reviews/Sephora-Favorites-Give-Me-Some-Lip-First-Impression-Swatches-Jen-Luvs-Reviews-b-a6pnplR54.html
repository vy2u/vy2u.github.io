hello my friends welcome to my first
impression at / unboxing of the Sephora
favorites give me some lip set now they
support comes out with these things all
the time the biggest ones come out at
the holiday season but this is the one
that just came out I guess it was about
a week ago as of the filming of this
video and I was really excited when i
just opened my mail and found this
inside so I figured I would just go
ahead and open it up and just give you
kind of a first impression review like
I'm just taking the tape off now I
haven't swatched anything I don't know
anything like that's in here except for
what's picture here and what was
pictured on the website when I ordered
it so that is how it comes and you get
up just let me tell you what it is it is
a sampler set for a sephora sold lip
product so this is twenty-five dollars
and you get one two three four five six
different lip products in here so the
first one here is the tart this looks
like a full-size this a full-sized look
at that I think that's full size chart
and coral blossom hold on a minute here
look at that and I already have this
shade look BAM it's a full size are you
kidding me oh that's so exciting okay so
what I'm going to do is I am NOT going
to swatch this one I'm gonna swatch
milena because this one's brand new and
I don't need two of them so I'm gonna
end up giving this away for giveaway at
some point um should we do it today
let's do it today okay all of a sudden
we're doing a giveaway oh my goodness
out of nowhere if you are interested in
winning this tart full-size coral
blossom lipstick and you're going to
comment down below that you're
interested in the lipstick and you were
entered and I will cut off the giveaway
within 24 inch hours after it goes live
so yes very cool so I'm going to put
that one to the side and I'm going to go
ahead and pull out mine and you can see
I have used it a bit and that's how that
look these are very very moisturizing
lip sticks they are not long wearing
they're not super long wearing their
typical to maybe it's had bit longer
than a typical lipstick at the end of
this video I'm going to go ahead and
swatch everything but I just want to go
through what's in here first so I'm
going to go ahead and set this
over here so that i know that i'm going
to put that one of my lips and not that
one and oh and here's another thing that
i already own this is the sugar fresh
rose up lip balm thingy and i have this
one as well and if you never tried a
sugar lip balm this is a great
opportunity to try one they are so
moisturizing and amazing i can't
remember if this one has pigmentation
i'm going to have to find mine because i
know i have not unpacked these yet and i
will show this to you on my lips in a
little bit but this is a really really
nice lip balm now it doesn't come with a
whole lot in it this is about a half
size of the the regular one but it is
definitely worth trying if you can find
a sample set or if you want to get this
set these things are fab so we'll put
that over there as well this one is
definitely a mini this is a mark eject
Jake majak hopes this is the Marc Jacobs
lipstick in Taeyang Taeyang I think it
stay on it means i love you in french
and this is a teeny tiny baby one is so
cute and this one I know I don't have
wait let me double check see I should've
check this out before I board i'm pretty
sure i don't have this one so i'm going
to go ahead and swatch this and that is
gorgeous is actually kind of similar to
what i'm wearing I think maybe a little
bit now I'm wearing on my lips right now
the LA girl flat finished pigment gloss
in bizarre it's really sticky I don't
like this formula that's my opinion but
that's that's a different video all
right so anyway this one looks gorgeous
and I cannot wait to try that one on for
you very excited about that one and then
this here is the Rouge infusion and
neutrals by Sephora open this baby I
don't know anything about this formula
let's sing looks very similar in shape
to the last one it feels like a liquid
lipstick it feels very wet so excited to
try that we'll see how that dries
whether it dries matte I haven't tried
any of this formula yet so we shall see
right i just looked it up Emma saying
says it's Sam you should Tim
because that's what Emma saying says so
that's what this one is called but I
really like the shade a lot on that one
I had to go back and make
that I said that one right okay moving
on so we'll put that line were there
with us a 401 this one is the makeup of
our Plexiglas that obviously is not
going to stay up is it yes you are yay
ok this is to make up forever Plexiglas
and for reals but I did get one of these
and I found it to be quite sticky if you
don't like sticky glosses you won't like
the plexi glasses and it is a true gloss
it's very very sheer but again I will
try that on for you in just a day and
then Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada ok this is
the one the reason what sold me on this
this is the kat von d liquid lipstick in
Lolita this one is very difficult to get
it's always sold out everywhere so it's
really cool that they put this in there
in their sampler kit and that is going
to be gorgeous for fall oh my goodness
so excited about this one I actually
just got a few more of those yesterday I
went shopping with one of my what's up
and makeup appt friends and she's in
chat sometimes Sandra we met up at our
local Sephora just to go shopping and
have some fun and i bought some she
convinced me to get a couple well she
laughed at me because i wanted to get
this one this one is in love sick this
is like a me color but she convinced me
to get this bright purple one in love lu
v so I'm excited to to rock that at one
point no Sandra I didn't want to wear it
for this video it doesn't match my
outfit but I am gonna wear it eventually
so now I have three different shades so
far i do like these I there I don't know
I haven't no verdict yet but I will be
trying this one on for you in just a
moment actually that's it that's all
that's in my kit so let's go ahead and
y'all middle lip swatches now yeah
absolutely lip swatches but before I
take this off you have got to see how
sticky this stuff is yuck are you
kidding me now will not be buying any
more bees well okay so my lips are never
in great condition i exfoliate i do all
kinds of things i put on lip balm
constantly and my lips are never in
great condition so you know i got real
people it so we're gonna have real
people swatches going on right now i'm
going to
and start with the ones that seem less
intense and then move up to most intense
so we're going to go ahead and start
with the fresh sugar rose okay i am not
going to swatch this one because i can't
find mine and i want to give this
forgive away i don't i don't think it's
worth it not to put this in the giveaway
just to swatch at one time you know what
I'm saying just know that it is very
it's got a little bit of a gloss to it
it's practically sheer you know if you
have very very not very pigmented lips
it may show up a little bit but for me
this barely shows up at all it's mostly
a moisturizing lip balm not really too
much color in this all right so let's
just do the artist plexiglass first
instead the make up for ever plexiglass
you can see like the stickiness yes
okay so now i squashed everything I can
kind of give you some first impressions
like cats lolita on let's start with
Lolita and then we'll go down the other
way so Lolita all right let me get my
other mirror out Lolita I like Lolita I
think it's a beautiful shade the it is
does have a drying pneus to me I can
definitely feel like I want a lip balm
like my lips are screaming for a lip
balm right now but that's part of the
deal when you get something that is
going to dry matte like this I think I
haven't personally found a liquid
lipstick that dries matte like this that
doesn't feel like it needs a lip balm to
me so I'll usually pop a lip balm over
top of these these the colour-pop ones
and and then I feel moisturize but don't
feel like it takes with too much of the
matte finish so i love the shade i put a
lip balm over it and then i'm happy but
if you don't like drying you are not
gonna like this for Mom alright going to
anyone's I do next oh the Sephora this
is the Sephora Rouge infusion neutrals
this I owe its in peony there we go
there's the shade this one's in PNE I
like the way this looks see like where
this I feel like there's no way in the
world this could be a natural lip color
you know I mean like it looks like it's
kind of it looks like a lipstick where I
feel like this looked more like a lip
stain on my lips I really left the way
the formula look unfortunately like I do
have like I feel like it's stained like
right here a little bit more than the
rest of my lips so I feel like this
would be better for people that have
more perfect lips than me but i will
probably rock this and wear this and
enjoy it it did not feel drying it all
it just kind of felt wet and then it
just didn't feel like anything so this I
I definitely want to try this more and
remember this is just the first
impression I wore this for about 30
seconds so you know don't take this as a
hundred percent review it's a first
impression but I am anxious to try this
more I did enjoy the formula for the 30
seconds then I had it on I felt like it
was easy to apply it's just I felt like
it really stuck to that one spot right
there you know I'm Sam alright next was
the more Jacobs this formula I
personally really really like I feel
like it's very very moisturizing I liked
shade a lot don't expect long lasting
power for this when i use my makeup wipe
to wipe it off it came off instantly
like no staining power at all but i love
the way the marc jacobs lipsticks feel i
like the way that they look this is just
one that you're going to have to reapply
like any typical lipstick I don't expect
extra staying power on that now the tart
I was really really surprised by the
tour I was wondering why I don't use
this very often sometimes I put things
on and I just forget you know like why I
don't use them very often did you see
how terrible that looked on my lips it
looked horrible oh my gosh it stuck to
all my dry patches it was a patchy
lipstick it looked terrible I just
couldn't believe it now this is the one
I was gonna do for giveaway and now I
feel like should I give you a lipstick
that's like I don't like you know what I
mean well I mean this is the thing I've
never told you all this but whenever I
do a good way I always include extra
stuff in there we work it out and I've
includes some extra stuff so if you want
to enter the giveaway I'll send you this
I'll send you this and i'll send you a
couple other things she will work out
whatever you like you want to try some
eyeshadows up there are some eyeshadows
and then you want some try some mascaras
i'll throw some mascaras in there we'll
work something out okay even if you're
not that crazy about the lipstick or if
you are crazy about the lipstick I don't
know we'll work something out whoever
wins they give away but yeah I don't
like it maybe you have perfect lips
maybe you don't have dry patches maybe
it'll work better for you oh no I don't
like it alright and then moving on to
the plexiglass the plexiglass is a
sticky gloss that's all I have to say
about it if the sticky gloss doesn't
have a lot of pigmentation it's not very
impressive I didn't talk about the scent
for these this has a very very mild
fishy sent it smells like fish to me it
does but it's very very very mild if I
had to say something it smells a little
fishy if you have an artist plexi gloss
I want you to smell it and I want you to
tell me if it smells like fish my does
marc jacob has a very very mild sweet
set but very very very mild I couldn't
smell on my lips at all
I could smell on my lips the Sephora
chemical berries chemical berries on
that one on the kat von d lips icky not
not super offensive lip sticky but a
little lipstick e the tart I'll smell
yours minty minty did feel minty smells
a little minty and then the roast smells
like rose hopefully this review was
helpful for you to decide whether you
want to get this kit or not do I think
this is worth twenty-five dollars I
don't know I guess it depends on how
much you want Lolita and whether you
like sticky glosses and whether you want
to try this lip stain and whether you
like a lipstick that's moisturizing
doesn't last whether your lips are
perfect or whether you like a really
nice rose tinted lip balm I I think it's
gonna be individual to each person I
don't think this is one that I could see
I recommend for everybody that I think
is a must-have I really don't um
personally for me I don't think this is
worth twenty-five dollars for me I'm
happy about these three and these three
I don't think is worth twenty-five
dollars to me I say this is worth 20
maybe 17 to 24 these three to me so I'm
not as impressed as I thought it would
be I'm sad but maybe maybe you know
everybody's different everyone has
different needs everyone has different
lips so maybe for you it'll be different
so but I hope you found this review of
the Sephora give me some lip sect
helpful if you did and then please
