i'm also going to show you the
application of these on my face hello my
friends welcome to my review of these
sephora favorites painted pink set forty
dollars u.s. $48 canadian it's a 122
dollar us value if you break it down to
dollars per ounce of product that you
get compared to the full-size so what i
do whenever i see one of these kits on
sephora i always go ooh is it worth the
forty dollars to try these products if i
bought the products i really wanted out
of this in full size would it add up to
forty dollars or more and the answer is
yes i always buy it oh I love these kits
because as a reviewer it's a great way
for me to test a lot of different
products that are very expensive for a
much cheaper price it's an also another
way for people that don't make videos to
try very expensive products for a
cheaper price so let me show you what
comes in the kids I have one product
missing out of here because once you
blow it up it doesn't fit back in the
box and that is these look see look it
doesn't fit back oh I could squish it I
could squish it all right I squished it
it does fit you just gotta squish it
real good alright so it does it back in
the mug let me go through these products
1 by 1 i'm also going to show you the
application of these on my face
everything that is in this kit is on my
face somewhere so we'll start off with
the Beauty Blender the Beauty Blender is
one of those products that people say
there's a do people say there isn't a
Duke that it's not really a Duke I don't
know I mean I guess for me there's no
exact duped or the Beauty Blender
there's some close ones but no exactly
do I do there's different ways did about
for applying this some people say you
should bounce it some people should say
you should roll it I don't know all i
know is i really like the way it makes
my face look want to put foundation on
using this thing are you really going to
tell that big of a difference between
the Real Techniques version of this and
that one for me there isn't a huge
difference also one from beauty junkies
i will be reviewing that on thursday of
this week so definitely keep your eye
out for that that one is a very
close dupe as well but we'll talk about
that on Thursday for right now
beautyblender is a huge plus for me is
it worth twenty bucks it depends on how
picky you're going to be about finding
the dupe you don't say next up is the
Urban Decay eyeshadow in scratch I
really really like this eyeshadow a lot
this eyeshadow is a really good lid
color for me I really love pink all over
the lid so it's really about whether you
like pink all over your lid or not this
is what it looks like on my lids on my
right side i'm using no primer and on
the left i am using a primer so i'll
show you now what they look like with
the primer without the primer so you can
see whether you think there's a
difference or not i personally don't see
too much of a difference at least with
my eye maybe when i zoom it in really
close for you you might be able to find
difference but for me I don't see that
much difference with a primer where time
is a little bit extended with a primer
but not so much that it's that big of a
deal overall huge win on this full-size
Urban Decay eyeshadow this full-size
Urban Decay eyeshadow will run you $19
just between this and the Beauty Blender
you've almost covered the entire cost of
everything in there which is kind of
crazy next product that I use was the
roller lash by benefit now I didn't use
a small one because I've already tried
the benefit roller lash and I'm totally
cool with not having another one so I'm
actually putting this away for future
giveaway so I'm not going to use this
one I did use my old one I pulled it out
of my mascara graveyard it's got
bacteria and I'm sorry to my eyes but I
wanted to use it so that I could show
you and I didn't want to purchase
another one I didn't want to open this
one but you know that's how the story
goes so basically this is my thoughts on
the benefit roller lash what I did was I
compared it to a master that I just
bought today that I wanted to try out
and that is that is the Kardashian
beauty the quickie mascara I just I
don't know it was just like a random
choice i just saw it and I said I've
never tried anything micronation beauty
so I tried it on my right eye and then
I'm comparing that right now with the
roller lash from benefit now I do feel
like the benefit Burwash is an excellent
mascara when it comes to length and
volume and awesomeness do I think that
you can get something just as good or
nearly as good at the drugstore
absolutely I honestly do I mean I know
people swear by the royal ash they say
it's the best mascara they've ever tried
I do think it's a very good mascara very
very good but I don't feel like it's
such a big difference that you have to
spend the money for the roller lash I
actually think this Kardashian mascara
actually kept up with it pretty well for
10 bucks the only my biggest complaint
about the roller lash that feels very
heavy all my lashes every time I put it
on I can feel it i can tell i have
mascara one like it's almost like i have
false lashes on there that heavy at
least for me maybe I sensitive eyelids I
don't know but for me it bothers me that
I can feel it on my eyelids oh so I'm
not gonna I'm probably not going to
repurchase this and I'm going to pass it
along because I know a lot of people
absolutely love it so if you're
interested in trying the roller lash
maybe that's something that's going to
call you to this kit there's two lip
products in this kit this one is the
Make Up For Ever lipgloss girlfriend
this is just a regular ordinary lip
gloss there is nothing fabulous about
this lip gloss it is glossy and it's
thick it's not sticky but it doesn't
it's nothing fantastic it smells
terrible it tastes terrible and I don't
know why make up for ever release such
an ordinary product and make up forever
is known for amazing products and this
is so less than amazing it's just that
it's a very ordinary formula and I'm
very sad to say that these plexi glosses
are just not impressive this is in the
shade 202 and it's just a very plain
gloss and this is a deluxe sample size
you are getting in here for the
plexiglass you're getting three
milliliters of product oh and for the
mascara you're getting of three grams of
product in the full-size you get eight
point five grams so it's quite
considerably less than a full size but
you got throw away my scare in three
months anyway so it's like next thing on
my lips is what you see prominently
displayed on my lips this is the Laura
Mercier lip color and this is in the
shade French kiss and that's really what
you're seeing I did put the gloss on
over top just so you can see what that
looks like but all man is this stuff
also i really love Laura Mercier
lipsticks yeah they call it a velour
lovers lip color this is a full-size and
it will run you twenty eight dollars on
its own whoa dude okay let's just talk
about opacity opacity
great I did take two passes on my lips
but I think it's because my lips are
always so damaged all the time if you
have healthy lips you probably won't
need two passes of it it's not a makeup
you smell but it's not a bad smell it's
like a little bit plasticky but it's not
strong it's very very mild where time on
this is wonderful I did wear this around
my house one day and where time is very
very good wears down very evenly it's
just a nice lipstick 28 bucks man comes
in the kit comes in the kit so this
color calls to you mm-hmm that's a good
one that's a good we're cheeks there's
two cheek products and they are smaller
versions of a full-size I guess they
call them the look so I've samples
apparently I don't know they always seem
bigger than deluxe samples to me the
first one is the tart blush and this is
in the shade blissful and i will show
you this one this is the one that comes
in the kit this is a full-size tart
blush in tipsy so you can see the size
difference of a full size versus a
sample size these sample size is 1.5
grams the full size is 5.6 grams so it's
a pretty big difference as far as the
amount of product remember this whole
kits only 40 bucks the this blush goes
on so nicely it's just the way tart
blushes always are for me they're very
very buildable very long wearing I do
have normal skin so I can't really speak
to how it's on other skin types but for
me it lasts through most of a workday
and be able to see just a little bit of
color at the end of the day so it's
definitely a win for me very excited
about that one and then I think the most
exciting thing in this kit for me and
what really pushed over the edge for me
was the back of highlight and this
vector highlight is in rose gold it's a
2.4 gram product a full size is eight
grams so you can see the difference
there again big big big difference in
the full size versus the the sample size
that you get in the kit this is
champagne pop next to it and then there
is the rose gold and just for fun most
watch them next to each other so
champagne pop is here rose gold is there
you're going to get the same quality as
you expect from a becca highlight it
goes on absolutely beautifully my big
problem better highlights as they just
don't last on me just that and straight
up don't last on me they definitely need
reapplication if I care
through the day they'll need
reapplication most the time I just don't
care I just let it go I can't say I
bring these with me because I'm just not
high-maintenance like that but they
don't last all day I would say they last
three or four hours before they're
completely gone so the very last thing
in this kit is this Deborah Lippmann
nail polish now this is an extremely
sheer pink nail harsh this is in the
shade baby love you get in this eight
milliliters of product and this is this
is one of those things that you may want
to use in like a French manicure
something like that I can't even
remember the last time i did a French
manicure like it's just not even my
style I like my nail polish to be
completely opaque I love using them for
nail art I like one coat polishes like
this is not me at all but I understand
that it is some people some people
really enjoy these kinds of nail
polishes so you know maybe it's for you
it's definitely not filming whether this
kid is for you or not is going to be
totally up to your personal preferences
and what you like for me personally it
was totally worth it Beauty Blender big
plus tart blush big plus eyeshadow from
urban decay big plus Laura Mercier
lipstick and a hair no hair hair did not
come in it Laura Mercier lipstick big
plus mega forever lip gloss terrible
roller lash I can do without it but I'm
you know if I didn't if I was gonna try
it again I would say yes Becca highlight
huge plus Deborah Lippmann nail polish
total fail for me personally in my case
so for me that pushes this well over
forty dollars in value so for me this is
a win I would love to know whether you
think this is a win for you whether
you're interested in it it is available
