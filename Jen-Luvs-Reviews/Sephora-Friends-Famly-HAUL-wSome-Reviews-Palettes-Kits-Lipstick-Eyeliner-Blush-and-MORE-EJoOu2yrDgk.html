friends and family hall i am so excited
to share with you the products that i
got for sephora friends and family a lot
of you know i did get a lot of people
codes for so for friends and family
thanks to my friend mike he is amazing
he's actually an old friend of mine that
I met on YouTube of all random places
but we stayed in touch through facebook
and he's just a really great guy and he
shared a code with me and these are the
persons that purchases that I made as a
result of having a code and let's get
rolling okay let's go yeah that's very
exciting that's very exciting i'm
shooting a video your pencil yeah i
don't know what happened to your pencil
look oh it's right there on the on the
on the green tray right there see it so
the first thing that I got that I'm
actually really excited about are these
nail stickers these are so so so pretty
and they were only five books I mean
it's cheap even for regular nail
stickers i haven't tried us a for brand
nail sticker yet but i will let you know
how these things go once i do use a
couple of good things from kat von d and
one fail from kat von d this is
something that I got that I absolutely
love and it's her blush in Essex I
already have the one in bellissima and I
adore it the formula is very it's very
very pigmented and if you push a brush
into it too hard it will create fall out
so you have to be very gentle with these
but oh my gosh ladies they are just so
beautiful this one is hassocks like I
was saying it's like a deep mavi pink I
love love love this and I am wearing it
said I don't know if you'll be able to
see it I don't like to load on my blush
so that is what that looks like here is
that swatch put it there for you
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous if I could
have every single kat von d blush and
bronzer in existence I would totally buy
them my fail from kat von d which
totally bummed me out was her tattoo
liner is in biker it is a gray i have
the one in trooper and that's the black
and I love it I don't know what's up
with this one it is so weird let me show
you what is that I don't even know what
that is what am I supposed to do with
that I don't even know I was hoping for
maybe I guess more of like an opaque
like silver
grey but this is just junk I'm returning
it I will probably trade it for the
Stila waterproof liquid liners it's the
same pen formula but I really like the
black one and that's I'm hoping that the
gray will be just as good as the black
one of back he's oh and spaghetti oh and
over there Urban Decay Anarchy face case
I wanted to love this that's why I
bought it as I wanted to love it and I
don't love it if I had known that this
shade was in it when i bought it i would
not have probably not have gotten it
because you can even tell right now how
powdery that shadow is i mean it is just
a junk shadow this is called provocateur
it was in the original vice palette
which i own and this was one that i did
not like this one is very similar it's a
little bit creamier in formula this
one's leaving a little creamier than
that this one is kind of pigmented but I
have a million shades that look like
that i also have a million shades that
look like that so i guess this is not
what i was looking for it was a little
hard to open at first but now that I've
worked on it it's a little bit better
this blush is gorgeous I really really
enjoy that it's a little pinky ER than
the kat von d but in that same family I
don't know what's up with a bright pink
blush I've never tried a bright pink
blush and don't plan on trying a bright
pink blush because this one's going back
to the highlighter is very very pretty
the lip product that comes in here is a
Urban Decay's of obviously super
saturated high-gloss lip color and
scandal I think I could get away with it
it's like a magenta pink but it's just
not my style you know what I mean it's
just too it's too much it's too loud
it's not like a buildable kind of thing
it's like either on there or it's not i
guess i could probably share it out with
a lighter color but i don't want to have
to work for it if i'm going to pay 40
some dollars for something i don't want
to have to work with the products in
there to make them go for me you know
what I'm saying the only thing I am
truly going to miss out of this palette
is this liner in perversion now I have a
gazillion zeros or the Urban Decay black
liners in 0 but perversion is just
blacker so let me show you what that
looks like i know i've got my cat bunny
swatches look at that
I mean just creamy and all get up on
this if I have zero the top ones
perversion the bottom one is zero i
don't know you can tell a difference but
I totally can especially in my lower
waterline totally can tell the
difference I'm going to miss this
hopefully I will see you again one day
so that's it I'm returning this it's not
worth the money to me I got my very very
first luxury high-end craziness lipstick
this is a 30 some dollar lipstick
because I'm that big of an addict I
don't know how people buy like three and
four and five these things and then have
yours and all those i fer the dr formula
is even better than this one but this is
the YSL and this is in rouge poor
couture and i am wearing that today i do
like this one because it is build a ball
do like a lighter swatch over here and
then you can do it darker it is so
creamy and i'm not even kidding i will
put this on in the morning before my
family leaves my husband drives my kids
to school i will kiss all of them and my
lips look exactly the same I wouldn't
say it's drying on the lips but I do
feel like I like a gloss on top of it
just to make my lips feel a little less
I guess it is kind of a little drawing i
could say because it is so mad but i do
enjoy it i just really like a glossary
top I don't have a gloss on state it's
my only complaint about it as it wears
it kind of um where's in the middle and
doesn't wear on the outside it's not
very even but I am going to keep it I am
enjoying it I don't know how many more
of these I am Wonder bikes i don't think
it's like over the top oh my goodness
totally worth it i want every single
color it's worth you know having a
collection of them but i am really
enjoying this one don't me i'm gonna buy
any more of them hey the first kit that
i want to show you is the BB buzz kit
this kit was $25 and you get to try five
different BB creams and i love that
because this gives me an opportunity to
review five different BB cream of course
it doesn't look exactly the same as it
did when i opened it because i have
tried and used all these i am going to
make an individual video just on the
reviews for these products this video
will be way too long if I review
everything and every single kit so I'll
just kind of give you a quick overview
we got the Smashbox cam ready BB cream
it's SPF 35 we got the two-phase tinted
beauty balm and this one is in
20 this is the dr jart baby um is
multi-action skincare makeup in SPF 45
the Stila stay all day 10 and 1 HD
illuminati illuminating beauty balm and
SPF 30 and then the i think i'm saying
this right basia BB cream and this one
SPF 27 now my biggest complaint about
this is i believe it only comes in one
shade which is white people color my
color light colored which i think is
kind of messed up because i'm sure that
there are many people that would love to
try something like this but this is way
too light for them so sephora for me to
you i love you but you really need to
put this in more than once coco i think
i'm on and on but i'm just gonna leave
it there you get my point i again i will
be reviewing each one of these in a
video coming up very soon to make sure
you subscribe so that you don't miss
that the next kit that i got was the
glitz and glam and this was $45 and it's
called a party sampler I don't feel like
no like there wasn't a martini in here
or anything and you get one two three
four five six seven eight different
products in here and there's all
different kinds of things in here which
is really nice this bag is super super
cute it's got this cool lacy doily like
floral floral print zipper is super nice
it's very soft very luxurious feeling
it's like leathery kind of feel it's
beautiful beautiful cosmetic bag inside
I got another one of those sila BB
creams I got some Sephora lashes these
are softer feeling lashes for a more
comfortable wear and it does come with a
very small lash glue which is very nice
it came with this Urban Decay space
cowboy eyeshadow and this one is there I
think it's called moon dust very very
very glittery this is I wouldn't say as
a shadow it's more of a glitter let me
swatch that for you it's just straight
glitter but I did want to try this so i
am happy to have this but this is
definitely not everyday wear for me it
is very chunky glitter next I said I
wasn't going to do reviews of this stuff
but anyway I am happy to have this this
is ignores lip gloss this is in the
shade gold digger it is very
very very sticky super super super
sticky not sure if I like this one yet
or not oh yeah I said I was going to do
a keep reviewing things I can't stop
reviewing we got the two phase three
wait lash lining tool that's what that
looks like a very unique product there
we got the Lancome Hypnose star this is
the way the brush looks on that one so
you can kind of get an idea almost looks
like a Christmas tree shape of a pine
tree shape and then we got this little
st. gel effect plumping topcoat and then
finally this Josie Maran pink escape is
the name of the shade this is a coconut
water color chic Joe and I was really
really really wanting to try this so
very happy to have that and again we got
all of that for $45 these kids really
are very nice to have especially for
someone does reviews like me so that i
can give you guys feedback on lots of
different products without totally
breaking my wallet if this one I have to
try really hard not to review the
products in here but this is the Sephora
favorite superstars beauty must-haves
and you can tell I mean these are things
that have been talked about and talked
about and talked about on YouTube they
specially chose the things in here
because they are very popular at sephora
I'll just quickly show you what's in
here again I'm not reviewing everything
i'm just going to just show you ah stop
falling out okay oh my Deborah had this
stuff get upside down so i'll just show
you really quickly this is a victor rolf
flowerbomb rollerball this is the
origins ginseng refreshing eye cream
Urban Decay eyeshadow in sin and
mushroom cool to have those together the
bumble and bumble surf spray ignores
lipstick and that is the color in that
very nudie nudie this one is in dolce
vita this is orgasm and laguna from NARS
these of course the most popular blush
and bronzer combo from NARS this is the
josie maran argan oil oh come on out
come out I tell you let me had a battery
come on this is the Anastasia brow gel
we got a full size better than false
lashes this is the duo
when with the fibers you put the best
gear on you put the fibers on you put
more mascara on I'm definitely we cannot
wait to tell you about what I think
about this we got a deborah lippmann
nail polish and this one is in cleopatra
crazy crazy we got this smashbox camera
ready BB cream in SPF 35 and I did get a
smaller one of those in the BB cream kit
but I was happy to get a larger size
this is the full size I can't get out
get out of here okay I can't get it out
there's the steel of eyeliner it's a
full size of course all not all of these
are full full full size but most of them
are really really good side they're not
full side they're huge I think this is
my favorite thing that i got from
sephora friends and family it is the kat
von d spellbinding i shadow book this
thing has stickin amazing and if you
just watched my palette video that I
collab with mrs. Lowell in Laura hi this
was the my favorite palette that i'm
currently using and i love this thing
these shadows are amazing
Suns going down on me goodness gracious
take me all day to shoot this video so
my favorite thing that I got was this
kat von d spellbinding i shadow book and
again i'm not going to swatch all this i
want to do a full video just on this
product ways this thing is amazing look
how stinkin beautiful now my biggest
complaints about this palette before i'm
not going to do a full review but I
don't like the plastic on the front I
think it's annoying and I don't like
that there isn't a mirror but I can live
without it I'm not stressed about it
it's not it's not a deal breaker for me
oh it's kill me not just watch these for
you but just trust me they are gorgeous
actually I'm gonna swatch 1 i'm gonna
swatch one alright which one should I
swatch I don't even know because I can't
even choose it's like choosing between
my children ok this one looks like hell
ok it looks like that's gonna have all
kinds of fallout Oh butter Oh butter oh
I love this ballot oh go get this for
yourself if you like colors if you don't
if you're not going to use the colors
don't bother with it but if you do like
the colors um now on to the little
sample e things the but the point perks
that I got so for 200 point park I got
this little tiny mr. your perfume let me
show you how tiny this baby is if I had
known that it was this tiny I probably
wouldn't spent 250 points on it but it
is so so tiny it does smell very nice it
is so cute it is it is a more mature
sent it's got a sweetness to it i'll put
the notes and everything right here for
you but i do like this a lot it smells
fancy to me like i know that it's you or
so i'm kind of maybe i'm just thinking
it's fancy but it does it smells like a
very formal sent to me like something
you would wear out on like a nice dinner
date okay for 100 points i got this
deborah lippmann happy birthday nail
polish the nail polish i'm wearing today
are my boho glam nail polishes that i
got from jewel of a couple days ago this
is actually November's and I just put
this over top of this one here I know
this isn't a julep review but this one
on the cream one it's called a blonde
cream it's in Alexandra and then this
one is in Asia Asia and if
blood like deep deep burgundy and I just
put the birthday a happy birthday over
top I don't see it as being any special
more special than any other glitter that
I own I mean I don't know why this is so
amazing maybe it's the true colors and
not the glitters that are amazing from
deborah lippmann i don't know all i know
is he's ridiculously expensive all know
seems bit overpriced to make and just
quickly a couple more little sample e
things of Smashbox liquid halo HD
foundation I did use the shade too and I
really enjoyed it nice matte finish and
I got a lovey a lovey s Bell I wish I
said that in French correctly i hope i
did i have loved this perfume since I
smelled it in a magazine and I'm so
happy that I have it now now smelling it
smells mildly like play-doh I don't know
it's a little alcohol Lee it's like
sugar and alcohol and play doh I don't
know but strangely I like it I don't get
it I don't know and then the last thing
that I got was this um YSL different
glossy stains I haven't tried any of
these yet but I've heard they're amazing
and I'm really looking forward to trying
them it's just they just had their not
really appropriate work colors so I
haven't dug into them yet but i will let
you know if they're amazing so that is
