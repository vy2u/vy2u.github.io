to show you the ridiculous amount of
stuff that I have gotten recently thanks
to my friend Mike hi Mike well you're
awesome my friend life that I met on
YouTube many moons ago who I actually
met at a youtube gathering when they
used to have that all of YouTube used to
gather believe it or not back five or so
years ago all the vloggers used to all
get together at random locations and we
were in Georgia one year and this is
where I actually got to meet Mike in
person I used i did a competition back
then called battle of the YouTube non
stars look it up if you want it was
really fun American Idol style
competition for loggers and I hosted it
and everybody got on trophies at the
ends and medals and different things and
it was really fun it was a great way to
involve the YouTube community and Mike
was one of the contestants embattled the
YouTube non stars part 2 so that's how I
met Mike and we've kept in touch through
facebook now hopefully you guys got a
chance to jump in on his discount I had
a video up it's now taken down of the

music for a news program
how do you know buh buh buh buh buh buh
buh buh buh ah we interrupt this
regularly scheduled hall for an update
on the Sephora code thingy that I did a
couple days ago so I talked to Mike and
he said that I could let some more
people in on discount code if you put

will be awesome for your twenty percent
off for Sephora but guess what it's only

your email you don't feel comfortable
putting your email down below send it to
me in a private message and I will still
get to it yeah have fun shopping if you
decide to do it back to our regularly
scheduled whole already in progress
first we'll go with the online purchases
these are things that I saw online that
automatically stood out to me is
something that I would want first thing
I thought was give me some lip and this
is support Phaedra slips sampler already
gone into this but I haven't tried
allowed the I don't usually do
house usually do reviews but I will get
to reviews on this once and actually try
to stuff but I was too excited and I
just had to show you we read on the back
what you get you get a company called
bite their lip shine in vintage company
called fresh their sugar rose tinted lip
treatment company called hourglass their
extreme sheen high shine lipgloss in
child Laura Mercier lip glaze and baby
doll which I love Laura Mercier lip
glosses I think that was what sold me on
this totally because I love my Laura
Mercier lip gloss that I have it's my
absolute favorite the Sephora collection
glossy gloss in precious pink and the
tarte lipsurgence it's a natural matte
lip tint in hope so you get all of that
I'll show you it again
next thing I got online was the upgrade
to gorgeous benefits um sample package
I'll tell you what comes in that which
I'm so excited about this is what it
looks like inside and it comes with a
high beam which I have been dying to try
benefits hiding for so long and I'm so
excited to have this this is going to be
a must put on my face tomorrow thing um
it's a luminescent complexion enhancer
so you're supposed to put it under your
eyebrows as a highlight or on the tops
of your cheekbones or wherever you want
to highlight a sugar bomb blush and this
is the color Oh comes with a little
brush and then there's the color I guess
the color is sugar bomb I've got a mini
version of their real mascara and it's
supposed to be I need lengthening
mascara so looking forward to trying
that this one I'm not as excited about
but I'm curious to see whether it works
the Porefessional benefit it's a face
primer I believe pro bomb to minimize
the appearance of pores so we'll see how
that goes i'm not going to concern about
my pores i don't think anybody noticed
is my pores maybe it's one of those
things where like I don't notice
people's shoes like some people really
notice people's shoes I don't notice
anybody shoes cuz I'm always looking at
people's faces but some people might
might notice pores I don't let me know
if you notice people's pores because I
never noticed if people have pores or
not but we all seem to be these beauty
people we seem to be concerned about the
pores Oh No got a little tiny sample of
the perfume laugh with me and that was
it for that and it comes in this cute
little case that i will be using again
I'm not this is not going in the trash
this will get reuse I mean it's not
really well made on the clasp is really
cheap but it's cute so I will definitely
be reusing that the other thing that I
got online was nice for play and they
packaged this
saying like it's a vault um I've opened
it many times but they wrap it in this
and then you open the box and then it's
wrapped again in cardboard and then you
get sure what color cheek palette now
with a little disappointed in the size
of these four because this thing is
forty nine dollars which I would never
pay for dinos for blush whatever this
has orgasm in at which I've never owned
anything by NARS before and I figured
this would be a good way to start off my
venture into nars cosmetics in store
tonight I got the Urban Decay d slick by
skinned anemia I've heard nothing but
good things about this I always have
trouble with my face getting shiny so
I'm really curious to see if this is
going to help me with my shiny face Oh
next thing I got was recommended by the
people at sephora and I asked for a brow
some brow products because i've been
using a cheap pencil and I just feel
like it doesn't work the way that I
wanted to I wanted some help a little
upgrade from that I've tried using
shadows they never quite work right so
I've got this brown brunette dark brown
Anastasia Beverly Hills brow powder duo
the only thing I didn't like about this
is it didn't come with any kind of wax
they did have some a wax stick that they
recommend it but it was $21 for the wax
sick and I could not justify spending
twenty one dollars on a piece of wax I
just some ridiculous to me so I think I
want to go to the drugstore and find
some wax if you use eyebrow wax to keep
your brows in place let me know what you
use especially if it's drugstore ok this
was also recommended by the people at
sephora and this is a Lancome lash
primer I learned through buying my
L'Oreal double extend mascara that lash
primers are good for me so I figured I
would try just a plain old lash primer
so this is the sills booster XL other
thing I'm so excited about I broke into
I know I said I was an eye on him I was
on an eyeshadow know by but i have no
mineral
except for the one that I got as a
sample in one of my sample boxes so I
got to bare minerals loose powder
shadows the two shades that I got our a
muted beach and in drama this is nude
beach and this is drama I'm super
excited about this colors I'm you can
use the nude beach all over and then the
drama is going to be like an outer
corner kind of situation so I am so
excited to use those those will be on my
eyes tomorrow oh so I'm talking to the
lady and sephora I'm over in like the
like skin cream section and the lady was
like can I help you of course because
they're so nice and I was like look I
don't know if I'm there yet I don't know
if I'm ready but i think i may need an
eye cream I may meet one because I'm
starting to think I need one and she
said oh it's okay don't worry about it
it's okay and I said my thing is I need
something farming but I'm not trying to
spend a hundred dollars on a firming
cream that does absolutely nothing like
I don't care about the price I just want
something that works if its cost a lot
and it works that's cool if it's cheap
and it works that's cool I just want
something that works so this is what she
recommended which is the origins a
perfect world for eyes firming moisture
treatment with white tea so we shall see
what happens with that I will let you
know and hopefully it works in if it
doesn't it's going back
so that's what it looks like outside of
the box and it is quick five fluid
ounces origins visionary formula
instantly makes skin under eyes look and
feel smoother relaxed and we need
vitamin A firms and tones and Micah
brightens dark circles lighten and
nature's avant-garde Ian silver tip
white teen blocks oxidation while white
birch extract helps lessen the
appearance of new creases crinkles lines
and wrinkles yeah that's what I need
because now that I'm in my mid-30s I'm
noticing that i am not in my 20s anymore
and those beauty bloggers out there that
are in their 20s enjoy while you can
haha now quickly onto the samples that I
got I got some Bumble and Bumble hair
grooming cream in a little little cup
here I got this men's cologne it's
called lap let Paul stay essential and
my husband put this on and it smelled
like a hot sexy man so I really like
this and then this is a photo Paris folk
vital vital doba shampooing ho thi
duration like hood look intense
hydrating shampoo so we'll see about
that okay I'm not sure what's gonna
happen with that because I don't really
need I had intense hydration my hair is
already a little bit lately so I might
pass this on to my mom she has dry hair
and I don't I also got some urad
hydrodynamic ultra moisture age reform
cream for cleansing and toning face neck
and chest chest torn my chest that's
weird I don't want to turn my chest I
think that's cool a lot more pre image
in our total people's chests with the
stuff we a dad we did we'd add we'd add
moisture lock leave-in conditioner so
there's that and I got this was
interesting this was I got online it's
called 21 drops and it is an
aromatherapy
like little scent like almost like a
perfume sample and it's called stressed
and it's supposed to reduce stress
through the smell of it so I don't
really have a lot of stress in my life
I'm very lucky but whenever I feel
stressed i'll put this in my little
personal dab it on a little bit i got a
little bit of stressful time coming up
at work so this might come in handy if
it actually works and i got a sample of
the Murad clarifying cleanser another
little baggie sample of that one more
thing one more sample that I got I got
um somebody was it was it Marisa lace I
think was Marissa lace was yes it was it
was Marissa late was talking about that
she always get samples of Taylor Swift's
wonderstruck and I had actually already
ordered this one so for and it kind of
made me giggle because I got this online
and its exact it's a sample of Enchanted
i chanted wonderstruck by Taylor Swift
and I actually really enjoy the scent so
um even though we're slices apparently
swimming in it from her beauty box
samples or whatever wherever she's
getting these things I'm really enjoying
it and i think i'm gonna i'm gonna use
this sample and if I got another sample
I think I'd be pretty happy with it but
I guess when you get the same sample in
a room and gets a little frustrating so
I understand that too it's all good
Marissa it's okay it's all good thank
