welcome to the weekly what's of an make
of chat we are going to talk today about
the upcoming vib Rouge vib and beauty
insider sale at Sephora and my idiot
self my a itself was rushing to get I
have my phone is loaded up with products
that I'm very interested in that I
probably won't purchase but if I was if
I did have a wish list if I was going to
purchase things those were the things
that I would probably be interested in
purchasing I'm not really on a no buy
but I'm one low buy and I'm trying to
really love the things that I have right
now I don't really need any products
right now for review for the channel so
I'm kind of trying to chill on the
purchases a little bit I just bought the
k'kaw Mario palette the reviews had me
intrigued so I wanted to try that for
myself and I do have some other products
that I'm interested in talking you guys
about I've got a couple other videos in
mind this week is gonna be a really fun
week for videos and you know I've got a
lot going on so I didn't want to
overload myself with purchases but I do
have kind of a wish list of things that
I find interesting and then I have some
products that I in my phone that I'm
gonna show you of things that I don't
recommend that I did not enjoy that I
tried or that I've heard a lot of
negative things about and then I have a
table full of products here that I
pulled out of things that I really
really really liked and that I feel like
if you're in the market for something
that this is something that I think that
you at least something that I can't say
I mean you will enjoy it because
everybody's different but these are
things that I personally really enjoy
and I'm very thankful to have I mean I
could have had twice as many products to
show you but we only have an hour so I
just kind of picked some of my favorites
but coffee is essential but the other
thing I wanted to say was that wait hold
on oh so I forgot to look up the dates
and and the sales I unlike the things
I've mics in here like soon
ohmygosh tab says that it's very very
loud okay story guys I am blowing out
sorry let me see if I can get that we
had the problem last week - how is that
is that better
so are you guys thank you tab I
appreciate you
hopefully that's better tab let me know
if that sounds better
but anyway so what else that I'm saying
oh that thing before we get started I
forgot to put this in the end of what's
the make up there will be no show next

Monday and Tuesday of next week so you

I'm going and who I'm gonna be with I'm
so excited it's gonna be a great great
great time and it's gonna be great
videos oh I'm so bad at keeping my own
secrets like this has been so hard for
me to keep a secret and I cannot wait
for you guys to hear about it and see
who it is I'm like it's fun it's fun for
it to be a surprise so but follow make
sure following me on Twitter or
Instagram or yeah I'll because I'll put
on Instagram stories Twitter I haven't
been on snapchat a whole lot lately but
but anyway let's get into the topic but
before we do I'm gonna go ahead and say
hello to the collective brain of makeup
awesomeness
also known as the people that are here
in live chat it looks like we might have
missed the very first people that were
in here possibly looks like AJ is the
first one that I see hello to you and
your butch liz is here Lola's Megan are
fabulous jack-of-all-trades Megan thank
you for being here Mimi good morning
Banshee news Jennifer kinda new here is
here and away
good morning to you Consuelo is here
amber and Sanjaya hello good to see you
and Alicia and Caitlyn and Abby and of
course Tabitha's here and Sarah good to
see you and we're gonna go ahead and
scroll all the way down if I didn't say
good morning to you good morning to you
and thank you for being here okay so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna start
off with the products and we go to my
Sephora shopping cart and this thing
better still be here it's for it's
pretty good at keeping my shopping cart
though I think they they want you to buy
things they keep that tracking on there
for a long time and we're gonna start
with things that are on my wish list
sort of things that I don't personally
own but that I think look cool the first
one is something that I do I own some of
it and actually one of the things is
here this is the bait bomb baby mini lip
and face set by fenty beauty and let me
see if I can show you that here and it
is I have the glass bomb here and I
really like this gloss mom and I'm gonna
talk about this now this was gonna be
one of the things I was going to show
you as far as my recommendations when I
first got this I was like it's a gloss I
can't remember front-running Hanukkah
off but I feel like with this face set I
think that I wish that I had gotten that
instead because I don't use all of my
products all the way through most of the
time because I just you know being a
makeup review I have a lot of things
that I'm constantly testing the mini
size would have been better for me and
also it comes with a highlighter and for
$23 I feel like to have both of those in
many sizes is great and it's it's let me
tell you a little bit about the gloss
it's not like a cherry kind of sense
there's no oh that's too much that's
very much oh it got with a cherry scent
it's a little bit heavy but it just
feels really good it's a little bit
thick and heavy though so if you don't
like that you won't like it but I just
love the way that it looks it's so so so
pretty and I really like it and the one
thing I really love is the applicator
it's so incredibly soft it's huge and
very very soft and it's just
very nice gloss is that anything that
you must run out and get today no but
it's you know very very nice I really
like that a lot so that's one thing that
I think is a great deal for that 23
dollars I think that's a great deal okay
they're your Megan's got the information
Megan let me tell you have I told you
lately that I love you I'm not going to
continue but I love you okay Megan says
so for sale dates are Friday for 22
Monday for 23 rouge gets presale also on
Friday the 13th through Monday for 16
and I believe that it was what was the
percentage off was because I think it's
different I want to say it's 15% for
Beauty insiders and I think it's might
be 20 percent for Rouge and maybe 15%
for vib I can't remember Nancy says 15
hi nan say it's all 15 everybody gets 15
Jenny says 25 is the way it's 25
everybody sang 15 15 percent for Rouge
and vib sarah says thank you so much
Sarah oh okay
15% for Rouge in VIP insiders get 10%
thank you everybody you see the
community's amazing amazing alright
let's go to the next thing so this is um
oh wait it mixed up my stuff okay
the give me lip sets and the the sampler
sets are so good they're so good to get
they give me lip sets there's one that
is on sale for 19 dollars and it just
look I mean these things are so great so
the only thing is is you have to look at
the shades and decide whether it's
something that you are interested in so
this is the $19 one it's on sale and it
looks really really nice I mean they've
got some good stuff in here I personally
really like the Urban Decay lip products
I know some people don't like them but I
do I really like that hourglass crayon
the TARDIS lip paints are very dry NORs
lipsticks are nice I've never tried that
smash
the buxom lip products a lot of them
have a cooling thing where it kind of
cools your lips I'm not sure if that's a
gloss I think it might be let's see yeah
for one lip polish and sugar which is a
very nice shade but it does have that
cooling feeling but yeah I mean for 19
bucks to get all of that it says that it
is a this is a weekly well so you
definitely want to jump on that this one
what is it said what was the value on it
the value on it is ridiculous it was
like 80 bucks or something for the value
where did it go I know I read it
somewhere it must have been on my
computer that I read it but it's got a
ridiculous value for it so that's
definitely something that I would
recommend if it's still available they
do have another give me give me some lip
let me show you that one this one's 28
it's the regular price these are really
really good really like these there's
also a new mascara sampler out the mass
air samplers are really nice because you
actually basically you're getting this
the the the deluxe samples for almost
free because you get you get to pick
whichever one you like the best of the
deluxe samples you get a full-size
voucher to trade in for for you know
full-size and mascaras are suppose to be
thrown away in three months anyway so
you could literally have your entire
years worth of mascara just from that
one sampler kit I love those things
there are such a good deal okay I'm
looking at the chat make sure missing Oh
kind of new here it's 83 dollars value
thank you so much for that
I appreciate you okay so oh hi Steph
happy to have you here
tart tard the tart via mermaid and make
waves eyes shadow palette I had no
interest in getting this absolutely none
no interest in getting this until I did
a collaboration if you follow me on
social media I did a collab on Friday
with a special guest should I tell you
who it is because most people that
follow me on social media already know
Samantha I don't think the voucher ever
expires I don't think it ever does but
anyway I did a collab
with with Lindsay Schoolcraft of Cradle
of Filth who it's uh like what this were
are are like music bands or whatever she
plays the keyboard she sings she's
amazing her voice is very Evanescence II
she's amazing so she came over and did
my goth makeup that's the video that's
coming out on Thursday of this week but
she really likes this palette she had
one of her fans brought it to wear at a
show and she loves it she said this blue
at the bottom the blue at the bottom she
said is amazing but um but yeah so I
didn't have any interest in this until
she said how amazing it was and now I
kind of like but yeah that video is so
good she is such a sweetheart you're
going to love her you wouldn't know
she's in this like crazy goth you know
like the music stay it's not my style of
music and I told Lindsay that it's like
it's not really my personal day she's
like I understand like she's so cool but
you know she you think that people that
are in you know such a you know that
they'd be edgy and like she's so nice
she's so nice you're gonna love that
video it's so good in anyway so I didn't
have interest in that until she came
over and now I'm interested all right so
now those are kind of it for my wishlist
items I believe let me just kind of
scroll down and make sure I'm not
missing anything so now I'm gonna get
into some things that I have tried that
I don't enjoy that doesn't mean you
won't enjoy them so I'm gonna try to
give you as good of a recommendation as
I can but I'm sorry I got distracted by
a notification I'm gonna try to give you
wait hold on a minute something says
somebody says something's a scam hold on
what is happening I'm missing things oh
that's not the Cradle of Filth fans in
here that's so awesome
grace says my husband loves them my
husband loves them too yeah I'm missing
some things I don't know what's
happening here okay
okay I don't know what's happened is
something okay I don't want to keep you
though okay so these are some things
that I personally don't think are worth
it but I'm gonna try to describe it for
you so that you can decide whether it's
worth it for you or not just just if I
didn't like it doesn't mean you won't
like it so this was the first saw a
unicorn essence I talked about this in a
favorites and fails at video if you like
face oils you may like this I do feel
that it is very overpriced for what it
is you can get some really nice face
oils for similar prices I think it was a
unicorn asset no I didn't ride the
unicorn essence I tried the gold one and
it was just I just didn't think that oh
she sent my vitamin C okay awesome thank
you but it just didn't it didn't do
anything that was worth $54 for me it
just seemed a little bit too much but it
may just because of me because of my
normal skin type that I just don't
appreciate it where someone made me with
a dry skin type may enjoy it more you
know you see all the Instagram videos of
people dripping it down their face and
they make it look old magic what
everything it wasn't for me that's just
me personally okay and then we go to
this is kind of old it's kind of an
older product but I do want to let you
know this was a terrible product the
sweet peach glow a peach infused
highlighting palette by Too Faced I mean
this was a product that I thought I had
to dig into in order to get any kind of
pigmentation stinking awesome I'm seeing
not awesome as I was reading a comment
awful awful awful product I mean it just
the color payoff was terrible for me
unless you're extremely fair and you
really want very very light pigmentation
you may you may enjoy it but honestly
what I they show this almost this woman
of a deeper skin tone and I don't I
don't think that that's like really I
don't think that that would I mean I
don't have a deeper skin tone but it did
not show up on me I mean look at this
beautiful woman I just don't
almost it almost feels like that can't
be real that can't be real based on the
pigmentation of it I just I don't know
I'm very skeptical of those photos that
those are real if you have a deeper skin
toning you tried this product networks
for you please let me know because I
couldn't get it to show up on my skin
tone like hardly at all and I'm like a
light shade I can't even
imagine but well yes that one did not
work for me at all
mama bear says I'm tan and that does not
show up on me at all thank you so much
for that I appreciate it
thank you okay Megan says I tried that
too face palette since I'm palest you
know what I hope that it would show up
on you I do have another product for the
pale princesses out there that we'll
show you in a minute
okay another thing that I don't I don't
recommend and I did do a full review on
the glam glow glitter mask this is a
variation of it I don't know for a fact
that these are the exact same
ingredients but because it says glam
glow my little pony hashtag glitter mass
gravity mud firming treatment which was
the same thing as the glitter mask it
said the same thing except it was a
glitter mask I'm thinking they're just
changing the colors but I don't know
100% for sure
all I know is I did research the
ingredients of the glitter mask and they
were not good at all I mean there was
some there was some good stuff kind of
hiding in there but it was so there's so
much alcohol and these peel-off masks
because they need it needs to be able to
dry down so the alcohol is going to dry
the skin it's gonna pull the moisturizer
skin to dry the skin so this it's gonna
basically counteract a lot of the good
things that are in if there are good
things in the glam globe the gravity mud
so I personally would not recommend the
My Little Pony glitters unless you are
you know I guess if you're like very
young and you're doing like a sleepover
or something and you like have plenty of
plumpness left in your skin so you can
you know afford to sacrifice some no but
it's just like you know I mean it's fun
it's one of the thing is it's fun it's
it's a fun product but they're really
you're not you're not doing your skin
any favors with this product if it's the
same as the gravity mud you're not doing
yourself any favors Michelle says glam
glow is way overpriced to me yes and I
really liked I still have the one
product I have it right where is it hold
on it's right here here it is this was
one of the ones that this I really liked
I still have this year I haven't used
since I did the review because I've been
trying a bunch of other skincare and I
was doing the halo beauty stuff but this
was one that I really liked the galactic
cleanse but that was kind of the from
the pure stuff I got from glam glow that
was kind of the standout again full
video I do have on a bunch of glam glow
stuff but this the gravity the My Little
Pony stuff just its novelty its novelty
and it may especially if you have oily
skin dry skin if your skin is out of
balance in any way it may throw it off
even more so this one I have not tried
but I've heard really bad things about
it the Too Faced white peach eyeshadow
palette I've heard really bad things
about this I've heard the pigmentation
is lacking and yeah so this is this is
gonna be something that I just won't try
but because I've just heard terrible
things about it I think about I can't
speak from my own you know from my
personal from my personal experience on
that one
VI beware sale is this week I think that
it said the 13th floor if I remember
before Megan post in the 13th firuze and
then the 20th for VIP and insiders
actually I guess that's next week
because the 20th is a little ways away
yeah so the 20th is actually not this
coming Friday but the following Friday
and the 13th is this Friday so it starts
this weekend this coming weekend for
rouges and then the 20th for insiders
and VIPs my friend oh are you I was so
good to see you she says she's only 21
subscribers away from a thousand oh my
gosh that's so exciting
her name is T erri le e Neff T and
thrifty we've done collabs and stuff in
the past she was a reporter for a very
very long time and she's been dealing
with a lot of health stuff going on you
can catch up with that on her channel as
far as that but I'm so happy to see you
Terry Lee Terry leaves a longtime friend
of the channel
okay so let's see okay so okay oh
there's more wish list all right no
before we get back to the thing the wish
list of let's finish this stuff cuz I
realize I've missed something from the
wish list okay this is something that I
don't recommend unless you love love
love love love glitter Stoppers if you
love glitter Stoppers this is definitely
for you if you don't like glitter
Stoppers you know as far as when I say
glitter top or if you don't know it's
like a wash of glitter that doesn't have
a ton of color pigmentation it's just
kind of a wash that you would put on
your eyes this is the Fenty beauty
galaxy eyeshadow palette I did return
that it just did the fallout was insane
the color pigmentation was not there it
was not enjoyable to use I did not like
that product at all mm-hmm okay this is
another one that I have not tried but
I've tried other products in this line
the Smashbox cover shot eyes shadow
palette this is the new one I tried a
couple of them I had a review I think of
three of them that I had purchased and
they were not good
Smashbox eyeshadows overall I don't
enjoy I find the colors too muddy
together some of the colors have grey at
least the ones that I did in a review
they would like be a green but then
there'd be like a black undertone so
when you blended it the green
disappeared and all you were left with
was gray it was a mess so just overall
Smashbox eyeshadows don't do it for me
I've heard some people really liked a
couple of them that I didn't purchase
but as far as the ones that I purchased
I didn't enjoy so that would be a not
recommend but I haven't had any personal
experience with this particular product
iris says don't like Smashbox eyeshadow
at all Hailey's never bought Smashbox
Meghan says smash buck doesn't appeal to
me I've tried too many products don't
work for me yeah and I've had kind of a
similar experience with Smashbox where I
got a few hits from Smashbox some of
their mascaras are very nice and what
else
but the primers I find to be very nice
but other than Oh No hello is a
Elisabetta that's about that's a
beautiful name okay so let me see any
other not recommends that I miss
anything in here because there was one
more thing that was kind of wishlist e
and you guys are gonna laugh at me
you're gonna laugh at oh no here we go
one more thing this is also kind of old
any two-faced cream cheap products these
are not good they're not good at all
pigmentation is lacking really really
bad the highlighter is it's so bad it's
definitely one of my least favorite
products from from Too Faced that I've
ever tried I was really upset about that
pie I looking cheek product - that one
was really bad
I think they sacrifice quality for
pretty on that one in order to get it to
look like that they might have had to
pack it really hard she couldn't get a
lot of color off of it but but yeah so
no I mean my opinion on the two face
cream cheap products not good all right
okay wish list
you guys are gonna laugh at me okay Too
Faced likes the festival eyeshadow
palette I know just just just okay block
out the unicorn's just pretending
unicorns aren't there and just look at
that and just look at the colors I heard
this is really glad that I heard it's
very good yes I couldn't bring myself
with the unicorns I couldn't bring
myself to get it I couldn't do it I just
couldn't do it
you know what I just realized
this check that I was showing it's the
same face and the same pose every single
time they're digitally putting that
stuff on her that's messed up right it's
it's their try on advertisement it's
digitally put on a girlfriend or
boyfriend the digital try on stuff is
you've got to take it with a grain of
salt because you don't know if it's
really gonna look like that if it's that
good pigmentation it's gonna look like
that but that's not real it's not real
these are cool though look at these
looks
I've heard of beautiful things trying to
tell me the same model but yeah these
looks are gorgeous so that that's
something that kind of calls to me that
I would get if I was getting something
but I'm not
all right so now moving on where we as
far 724 minutes it's a great time to
move on let's move on to some things
that I do recommend it was really hard
for me to pick things because this is
kind of my price point this is where I
feel comfortable buying in my personal
life I mean I think everybody's got
their price point where most of their
products kind of fall within a specific
range you know with you know whether
it's drugstore high-end or luxury you
know where you have like kind of your
comfort zone this is my comfort zone so
this is where I have the most products
it was really difficult for me to choose
things but these are kind of the
products that I felt like stand out to
me so this is the Too Faced priming and
matte skin primer I've talked about this
a million times if you've heard me talk
about this a million times I apologize
repetition it does have a very strong
scent so if you don't like that you will
not like this but I love this because of
the way it seeps into the skin it just
has it does have a little bit of a
cooling feeling when you put it on and
it just it seeps into the skin and it's
almost like water like it just it seeps
in it's not silicone II at all it
doesn't give you that that slip that
sometimes will make your makeup slide
around everywhere it just feels good and
I feel like it does make my makeup last
longer it's really really nice and I
love this I don't wanna spend too much
time I talked about it like a million
times
another classics for primers I've got
three of them for you Urban Decay and to
face for the primers and these both work
very well for me I don't I know they
don't work well for everybody these do
have silicone in them so if you have
oily lids I've heard these don't
necessarily work that great the formulas
for these are almost identical at least
the last time I checked a year or so ago
they were very very very similar Joe
says I've gone out of sync hold on a
second in my view it looks like it's in
sync so hopefully it's just your um your
buffering hopefully it's not for
everybody uh but yes so these these are
silicone based if you Orly lids these
may not be good ones I don't know the
ingredients on this one but I've really
been enjoying this one this is the
Smashbox photo-finish
lid primer and this is in the shade
light I really like this one a lot
okay Melissa says I have oily lids an
urban decay primer works great for her
okay
fantastic well maybe I'm wrong on that
one Jenny says I'm in sync okay great
okay everybody says I look like I'm good
okay awesome
I might we just spend that one person's
personal buffering so nothing
everybody's saying in sync like the band
I can't even think of an instinct song
off the top of my head I'm a bad bad 90s
child okay so anyway okay so we got
primers now I didn't pull out any
foundations or concealers because I had
made that commitment to only promoting
primers and concealers on my channel
that have a good shade range because I
know if a lot of my audience can't use
it there's no point in me presenting it
so I did leave those out I am on the
hunt today for my correct shade of the
NARS foundation in NARS concealer I have
some of those in store gift cards that I
need to use that I want to use and every
time I go home does the poor thing never
have my shade so I'm actually going
today to try to get those because they
do have a really nice shade range and I
might pick up some other complexion
products that have good shade ranges so
I can I can talk about some more of that
stuff on the channel and give you more
recommendations on things like that so I
don't have any of those it's a day but
I've got a stupid amount of eye shadow
and highlighter products so so yeah so
let's let's talk about Natasha to know
enough for a second I really like that
tropical palette is tempting the
tropical palette is tempting I really
like Natasha - no no I shadows that is
my personal thoughts I think that they
are very good but I do feel like there
is a little bit of variation in the
palettes for example I really really
love the green brown one this is the
green brown one this was actually gifted
to me by someone my friend Nancy that
she had got she already owned it and she
got it in her beauty lush lucky bag and
then she sent this one to me because she
didn't need two of them which was so
kind of her and I really really love
this palette I love the mats and
the shimmers I find that some of the
glitters will fall during the day so if
I'm gonna use any of the ones that have
a lot of glitter I will use a glitter
glue but they are just the most
blendable beautiful eyeshadows really
really really love these Jennie is here
Jenny actually bought this for me I know
this is I'm not trying to brag I promise
I'm just trying to say thank you and I
feel like it would be extremely rude of
me to show you this stuff
and not to say thank you to the people
that purchased it especially if they're
in the room and Nancy and Jenny I think
are both here so Jenny purchased this
for me this is the Natasha - Nona Lila
palette and this is something I
personally really wanted because it is
my daughter's name my daughter's name is
Lila and it's my favorite color
are these close to my favorite color
purple is my favorite color which is one
of the reasons why we named her Lila but
that's a whole another story and this
one is good but I don't like it quite as
much as the green Brown I feel like this
one seems to be a little more flat so I
I do like it but I feel like the color
selection I feel like I'd like to reach
into other palettes I thought there's a
lot of mid-tone in here where I need
something else to bring in with this
stuff and like this shade right here is
money it is so beautiful I find on the
lower lashline I don't enjoy it because
it looks a little bloody but on the
upper lashline it is so pretty I'm not
laughing about the eyelid it looks
really really pretty and cuz it's got
like a little bit of a purple shift to
it it's so pretty I don't know if it's
coming across on camera but it's
gorgeous that one's my favorite shade in
here and I just really enjoy Natasha -
Nona's formula a lot so thank you to
Nancy and Jennie for for sending me
these I appreciate you so much and you
know I know people get upset about that
stuff I would never ask anybody to
purchase anything for me I just want to
make sure that that's clear I do not
need people to purchase things for me I
don't want people to be sending you know
lots of things I Jenni and Nancy have
been subscribers for a really long time
they're very awesome people but I would
never ask my subscribers to send me
anything I want to make sure that's
clear because that people like to twist
that okay so moving on to things that I
personally purchased
this I bought at the vib Rouge sale this
is the natasha Pat McGrath this is the
mother ship palette this is sublime and
I have to tell you this is very unique
the shades in here are very unique as
far as like the shimmers here these over
here you could probably find dupes
somewhere but Nicky says who sends you
what is your big bro Thank You Nicky
Marnie I love you but I find these to be
also just like the Natasha to Nona
extremely easy to work with very
blendable one thing I find about super
high-end eyeshadows like Natasha to Nona
Pat McGrath visi art is that they kind
of don't go on quite as pigmented as
let's say like I don't know like on
honest Asya eyeshadow palette where it
just punches you in the face with color
like what I am here's a color this
doesn't punch you as hard it just kind
of slowly gives you that gradient so I
find these super high-end eyeshadow
palettes much easier to build a pretty
look then it like an honest Asya palette
where I feel like I have to just be
careful about how much products are on
my brush wear with these it just slowly
builds on its own and I love that and
these guys over here are super super
super fun Aaron says I'm miss Kimberly
Clark I haven't talked to her in forever
I should email her and see how she's
doing she I should probably won't even
email me back because she's on tour but
wait till you see these babies oh my
gosh
I mean it's very hard to be unique in
the eyeshadow world this is what I want
this is what I want in life from all
makeup brands are shades like this can
you see those like the shift I don't
think the shift is coming off look at
this guy right here I'm looking at it on
the camera you can't you it's not the
camera is not doing these things justice
if you have a Sephora near you and this
is something that you're considering
getting I would definitely recommend
going in and swatching them now this guy
right here this one right here doesn't
show up quite as pigmented but you can
pack it
one and give a really pretty like inner
corner highlight thing like that
things like thing like that but yeah
these are just so much fun to play with
and I really really like it a lot I have
to admit if you are looking for
something that is amazing that is at a
lesser price point than these I am
seriously in love with this eyeshadow
palette I did not expect to be in love
with it I used to be in love with a lot
of Too Faced eyeshadows I just have the
sublime Rebecca I used to love like the
the chocolate bar and the bonbons and
all that stuff I used to love those
palettes and then I tried a bunch of
other things I tried G vias place and
color drain and I started really falling
in love with the very pigmented
eyeshadows and Too Faced kind of fell by
the wayside so did Urban Decay as far as
the pigmentation of you know what the
naked palettes and things like that that
I used to love well when I tried this I
honestly didn't have super high hopes
but oh my I really wish I had done a
full review on this it is so stinking
good I like telling this story because
Nicky Murphy's here I'll tell the story
so when I was going to the glam masters
premiere in New York City if you aren't
watching glam masters I've been really
enjoying it with candy Johnson and
Laverne Cox and oh it's so I enjoy it I
don't know if anybody else is enjoying
it but I'm enjoying it so when I was
going to the premiere party that I don't
know how I got invited to I was
following the Nicky Murphy tutorial it's
her New Year's Eve tutorial and I used
this palette that's a palette that she
used and my look looked so good I was so
proud of it I was so excited about it
and I used this palette and she totally
guided me in the right direction for for
my look for that night but these shadows
are so pigmented when talking about like
the Anasazi a punch you in the face kind
of thing lisa says Mallory is on it yes
she was and I cried when Valerie cried I
cried I love that girl I love her so
much she's such a sweetheart
but let me swatch a few of these for you
I'm just gonna go just kind of randomly
and grab a couple but it's just it's a
beautiful beautiful palette let me see
if I can bring these but this is one
that you have to kind of go in with a
light hand if you want to
Marie says do you have do your thing
the hourglass free pan palette is it
worth it I actually have those here I'm
gonna show you this you the highlighter
palette I'm going to show those to you
but yes these are to finish this up this
is a huge win for me it's one of my
favorite eyeshadow palettes right now
along with right now I've been using the
Julia's place magic palette that's
that's the other one that I keep
reaching for over and over again is this
and the magic palette but the magic
palette isn't available at um isn't
available at Sephora the last eyeshadow
palette I wanted to mention is the Just
Peachy palette by Too Faced I'm two
phases so hit mess it's like when they
when they hit they hit for me when they
miss they miss so bad it's like complete
opposite ends of the spectrum I either
love it or I absolutely despise it so
this is the Just Peachy mattes palette
if you're looking for a matte palette I
find this to be really easy to use
really fun to work with
I do find this to be I've watched a
bunch of women of color using this
palette and seeing that they've created
some beautiful looks with this so you
know no matter what your skin tone you
should be able to come up with some
beautiful looks and it's just very easy
to work with very um you know just very
very buildable blendable you see if I
can get with a more space here they're
just so smooth and not patchy and I feel
like with with matte shadows the
patchiness is really hard to avoid and
just really love that just really really
love them and they are buildable which I
just enjoy so much so that was the last
i shadow reco in the comments so people
can learn from you of things that you
personally enjoy and recommend okay so
it looks like I was skipping for a
second hopefully it didn't miss too much
Gracie says anyone tried the julius
place brushes how do they compare to the
Mac I really enjoy the genius place
brushes I don't find them two of them
the the blend the way that they work
they just seem a little bit more
the map brushes to me let's go back into
this stuff um now what happened okay it
looks like we're having some issues with
the streaming hold on a minute it says
YouTube is not receiving enough video to
maintain smooth streaming such as
viewers as such viewers will experience
buffering hopefully everything's okay it
looks like it's back okay so hopefully
it's back hopefully we're good sorry
guys it looks like there's um okay
the stream health is back to normal I
don't know what happened there sorry
about that you guys okay so anyway let's
move on the benefit 24-hour browser I've
talked about this a million times really
really really good sorry for that I'm
freaking out I have no control over it
it's YouTube man or it's my connection I
don't know but but this is really good
in the reason why I like this particular
product this was set in PR but there's
like I mentioned all the time that
doesn't influence my review at all if
it's good it's good if it's not it's not
just like I was saying with the glam
glow stuff that was set in PR it was
terrible this is really good okay this
is it's not crunchy and when you put it
in the brows it does hold them in place
but without being crunchy there's no
obnoxious smell I like the wand I've
talked about it a bunch of times really
really like this as far as actual brow
products honestly I'm starting to feel
that a lot of drugstore brow products
like the pencils and all of that are
just as good as a high-end so I really
don't think in my opinion at this point
that that brow products at Sephora are
necessarily worth it unless you need a
specific shade that you can't find at
the drugstore but if I had to recommend
some brow oh no is my mic is having
issues again apparently I don't know
Rachel wants to know if I'm going to
iMac to New York yes I will be there on
Saturday hopefully I don't know
hopefully everything's okay it looks
good on my end oh but if I had to
recommend brow products these are very
very similar it's like you know one or
the other it doesn't really matter this
is the Too Faced chocolate brownie and
then this is the goof proof proof brow
pencil both of these are equally as good
for me
I don't think I am brow products are
really necessary I feel kind of the same
about mascara I feel like a lot of
drugstore mascaras are just as good as I
am not really necessary to buy that the
high-end stuff this one does smell like
chocolate so if you like that go for it
but I really like this kind of slanted
edge that this one has really really
liked it a lot this one's very similar
and they both have spoole ease too it's
got like this one's more of like a
teardrop
but but yeah really like both of these
are both very good I don't know I don't
really think high-end brow products are
100% worth it at this point if you did
not know if you did not see on social
media if you've seen that cover girl a
huge box of PR stuff I did get that I'm
still testing it but I've got some
really great information for you there's
some big hits in there that I was
completely shocked of course there's
definitely misses but there are some
good hits in there if you just as a
preview the brow products are actually
really really really good Monica wants
to know how many colors they come in I
don't know off the top of my head I'm
sorry tab says Jen gets all excited and
her personal volume goes up that that
does definitely does happen this is true
this is definitely true okay so let's go
into Oh before we move off from
eyeshadow I did want to mention briefly
give honorable you know definitely
mention to the Stila
these are are the Magnificent metals
thing image once's this is magnificent
medals at glitter and glow I think
they're all glitter and glow glitter and
glow glitter and glow yeah these things
are phenomenal if you've never seen
these let me swatch them real quick for
you because they are like magic in a
tube I would really like to try some
like milania's coming out with something
similar I would love to do like a
smackdown of products like this I'm just
gonna swatch a bunch of them on my thumb
area over here so the first one here let
me tell you the shades of this one is
ballet baby the next one is called
diamond dust and then the third one is
called sea siren I remember I was with
my friend Nicole
her channel is yay or nay Nicole I was
with her in San Francisco and we
swatched see siren and I was like girls
I need this in my life and they were out
of it so I ended up buying it online
hopefully you can see that this angle is
way off but these things are gorgeous
all over the lid like this guy is money
all over the lid you can use this for
eyeliner as well you can use this for
cut crease I've used that for cut crease
but oh my gosh they're so pretty
they're so pretty they are amazing the
only thing is is you want to make sure
when you put them on your lid and you
kind of keep your eyes open for a while
until they feel like they're dry because
they will transfer especially if you
have hooded lids they'll transfer like
really really bad so be careful with
that but these things are stinking
amazing and I honestly like if you will
wear something like this I do think
they're worth the price point especially
on sale all right let's go into cheek
products I've got a stupid amount of
highlighter stuff here oh gosh man I am
so I should have organized this stuff on
my table there was one more eye product
that I wanted to show you this was an
impulse purchase and I'm so glad I
bought it if you like shimmer and shine
on your eyes the mid oh
Karen wants to know the middle one the
middle one was diamond dust diamond dust
is the silver this is the foil finger
paint shadow palette by Tarte you don't
get nearly enough shades for the price
not nearly enough shades these two are
kind of junky I don't really like these
these are kind of black but these three
here are money good
they are like they're moist and insanely
pigmented and foiled just do I have any
space on that side see I'm an idiot I
should have put on the other side okay
let's see if we can put it on very you
know try to put them over here okay we
made it it's so overpriced so I think
it's like 30-some dollars but you hardly
get anything in it I mean it's really
you're buying these three shadows right
here these guys your unique glitter glue
they're fine they're just not they're
fine
the chunky glitter Atari kinds of things
but these guys are sick like I don't
know what is going on with this formula
but they need to keep using it they are
like yeah there's a
and as student people like moist yeah
they're moist they got a whole pool
they're so good
I just I think that it's the the the
packaging is beautiful I feel like the
setup of this is kind of stupid like
they need to give us smaller pans six of
these you know like then I think it
would be amazing but love that love it
especially on sale at full price I feel
like it's a little bit overpriced okay
so now let's go into the cheap products
I think I'm finally actually done okay
so we were talking about our glass three
pants okay so you have to think about
who you are okay are you the person
likes to glow to the gods or you the
personally just like some nice subtle
highlight that just you know gives you
this beautiful lit-from-within well if
you like to lit from within glow the
original one the ambient one where it's
got dim light incandescent light and
radiant light perfect for people that
just want a nice light glow it's
gorgeous
really really pretty you like to grow
from the God to the God so they can see
you all the way down here the ambient
one is with absolute strobe light pure
strobe light and Lucent strobe light
this one is beautiful and I love these
because they set into the skin very
nicely I don't know what it is maybe
it's the way that the powder is milled
or something I don't know but it's it
really blends into the skin instead of
sitting on top of the skin where you
know you just see it kind of striped out
like they just blend beautifully into
the skin they're so beautiful and you
know you just have to decide which
person you are but I definitely
recommend both of them especially on
sale they're very very very nice other
highlighters I got to bring up card
again because I feel like tarts
highlighters are very very underrated I
do I feel like they're very underrated
there's some things that art does really
bad but I think highlighters is not one
of them this I've talked about recently
this is the twinkle skin volume - these
guys are beautiful these two here
especially I really really enjoy if you
have a medium to deeper skin tone you'll
be it you should be able to use
this palette for as well because we do
have some deeper shades here these are
beautiful like doubling as highlighters
I mean highs oh my gosh did I sleep last
night doubling as eyeshadows they
definitely can be used as eyeshadows
they're they're beautiful absolutely
beautiful another palette that I really
love is the TARDIS Pro glow the only
thing about this is I don't like the
cream products I'm not a fan of the
cream products at all but I do like the
the powder products now this one if you
are of a deeper skin tone I feel like
some of this is gonna work and some of
it might not like some of these
highlighters might be okay as far as
like these over here but this contour is
probably gonna be too light for a lot of
women of color this you know once you
get into contour shades I feel like we
really need to do you know multiple
versions kind of like the Anastasio
which I'm going to show you right now
this one right here they do have
multiple versions of this one my package
has been through the ringer but there's
they have different variations of this
one for different skin tones
so for contoured this may be more where
you want to go if you have if you don't
think that the shades are gonna work
well for you in here they just are
really good high-quality but yeah these
are really really nice I've used this a
lot I know it doesn't look like I've
used it a ton but I have and really
enjoy that another contour product the
lorac oh no the rock is intact I got put
out the lorac lorac eva is it Ulta not
so for I the Kat Von D was the one I
meant to bring out that when I also
really really loved I'm trying to go a
little bit faster because we're starting
to run out of time and I want to make
sure I get through everything okay next
thing I noticed this is still available
this is the Kat Von D alchemist
holographic palette this is a fun toy if
you want to play with color it's a nice
fun way to play with color Lindsay when
she came over and did my makeup she used
this quite a bit for my goth makeover
and it's just really fun to play with
you can tap it onto your lips you can
put it over top of your eyeshadow as a
topper you can put it on your cheeks I
do have a full review of this as well
and I show it over top of a bunch of lip
products
it's so fun it's just a transforming a
really really fun product Mimi says a BH
amrezy is amazing I have I can't
recommend that yet I do have it
I can swatch it for you I do have it in
my drawer right there but I can't
recommend it yet because I've only used
it one time and that was for filming
what's up and makeup yesterday it was
the first time I used it so I can't
recommend it yet but it is nice
it is nice I don't know if I'm like over
the moon drying over it like most people
are but I am enjoying it from the one
time that I've used it but I definitely
can't recommend it yet but yeah this is
a really fun little toy it's enjoyable
and if you just want to play with
something new I definitely recommend
this this is fun okay so another cheap
product that I feel like people don't
talk about much remember I was talking
about the pale princesses I've got a
blush for you this is for you Megan if
you've never tried dandelion by benefit
this is a beautiful beautiful very
lightly pigmented pink blush it's so
pretty
and it's just very subtle and pretty and
gives you just a nice natural
lit-from-within kind of you know flush
you know it's just just gives you this
beautiful flush if you you're pale
princess like Megan I think you'll
really really like this I don't know if
you've ever tried this Megan but it's
it's really nice and I actually don't
hate this brush some people really hate
these little brushes that benefit puts
in their box blushes I actually really
like them but I've been really enjoying
this I've been enjoying this a lot and I
recommend it I love the lasting power of
it lasting power has been great Bonnie
says she loves dandelion Mimi says
twinkle is great to our Jessica's
leaving bye Jessica thanks so much for
being here
lisa is a pale girl here Michelle says
love moonchild since I'm pale I got it
on sale and nice but yeah this one's
really good this one's dandelion and
I've been really enjoying this this also
was sent in PR I wanted me I try to say
that every time I'm not that it matters
for me personally in my brain but people
I feel like it's it's important for
transparency sake okay
another underrated product are the nude
sticks lip products especially the ones
that are
as magnetic whatever what do they call
the magnetic ones on a minute
it says magnetic something or another
here we a magnetic matte lip color these
are so creamy and good and the lasting
power is fantastic so so good I mean
they're there pencils and they do this
set came with a sharpener this also was
PR from Jen Beauty but really really
enjoying these and I just love the
lasting power of them and the hydration
of them I feel like a lot of lipsticks I
really like the hydration of them but
they wear away very quickly where I feel
like these lasts a lot longer
the other thing was this right here this
is the Pat McGrath flesh 3 this is the
shade that I'm wearing and what's it
been makeup in today's episode it's
really the lasting power is ridiculous
this one is a lot drier though where
this one's more hydrating this one is
can be very dry on the lips I like to
use this with a little bit of gloss just
have to be careful which gloss because
some glosses will make it like slide
around and be crazy but this I
definitely do enjoy it does crumble
after a while on the lips especially if
you have any kind of oily foods or
anything this will crumble at least on
me it crumbles but a little bit of gloss
it just refreshes it or a little bit of
chapstick you know you grab a chapstick
out of your pocket put it on and it just
refreshes it beautifully so I really
enjoy these they just take a little bit
of extra love to keep them looking
beautiful but I don't but I don't feel
like I need to reapply the lipstick to
keep the color it's just adding a little
bit of hydration on them but these I
don't feel like you need that I feel
like these are just just good from the
jump the other formula is like the matte
formula there's a lip and cheek formula
I do really like but my favorite is the
magnetic is my favorite they're really
really good really good it's weird
because every time I beat the people
from nude sticks they're like oh hi like
I feel like they just don't aren't
interested in talking to me like ever
like they've got like okay nice to meet
you see you later like I just get this
vibe and maybe it's all in my head but
it still really like the lip products
even though they haven't been like
moist it's a it's a descriptive word you
have a suggestion or something else I
could say other than moist wet juicy um
but anyway all right so wait hold on do
I have anything else okay other lip
products okay the Too Faced la cremes
have been a classic of mine that I've
really really been enjoying really
loving the la cremes I also really like
the new peach lipsticks those are very
nice as well they do have a peach scent
these these don't you've got a little
bit of a simple it's not a hydrated
there you go mom it's not necessarily
hydrated though I don't know hi Michelle
Michelle is one of our fabulous
reporters a facebook admin all of that I
love you Michelle Huma but yeah a little
bit of a scent but not it's almost how
do I describe that like a little bit
sweet but not like sugar sweet I don't
know like sweet with a little hint of
not floral like almost I don't know it's
not it's not some real sugary where the
peach ones smell like creamy peach and I
like both of those formulas I feel like
two faces a nice job with their their
stick lipsticks the liquid lipsticks is
a whole other issue but I like the the
solid lipsticks Valerie says Moises just
find yet I'm sorry that's my vocabulary
Selene says aren't those two-faced
lipsticks discontinued maybe it's
definitely possible but if you can get
your hands on pink chocolate it's my
favorite it's been my favorite for a
couple of years as far as the two-faced
lipsticks anyway alright we've got one
more blush product and then I think I'm
out of stuff and then I want to take
some recommendations from the community
I want to spend about five minutes doing
that I
they want to give a shout-out to the
Marc Jacobs blush this was also set to
me by a subscriber actually this one
wasn't the one that she sent became
broken so I took that back to Sephora
and they didn't have that exact one in
stock so I end up getting this one and I
really really love this I love the
two-tone and this of it this one is in
the shade nightfever and hot stuff I
love that I can go a little deeper a
little bit lighter mix them together
lasting powers fantastic again just kind
of melds on to the cheek if you have a
lighter skin tone don't be afraid to use
blushes like this and you can use a
light hand and they can be absolutely
beautiful even if you have a lighter
skin tone don't be afraid but yeah so
that was all the things I wanted to show
you that I have on my table I do want to
get some recommendations from the
community I do also want to mention that
I just started because I am almost done
with halo Beauty review of that is going
to go up on Tuesday my three-week review
I've already filmed it I just need to
edit it I started using drunk elephant
products that were sent to me in PR I've
got the whole regimen that I'm working
with and I will let you know because I
saw a lot of people talking about the C
firma from drunk elephant as something
they want to invest in I can't give you
a review on it yet I've only used it
once but I did take them before pictures
yesterday and where we're going into it
I drunk elephant yeah so expensive total
Annette says and that's why I never
bought drunk elephant is because you
know I look at this product and the
packaging is beautiful I've heard great
things about it and then I see that it's
$70 it's like nope and I put it back
because it's just out of my price range
but I know it's not out of everybody's
price range in people that I'm that
watch the channel so I do want to review
it I want to see if it actually works
and if it's worth it I'm pretty sure
that Tati doesn't like the drunk
elephant stuff and a pretty sure
stephanie Nicole does like this stuff so
it's like I've got two people that I
trust their reviews and I don't know
where I'm gonna fall on it so mr. Ashton
says yet they are less expensive than
other brands though Jenn uh this is true
this is true
I just brands that nobody really talks
about but they do have some really good
quality products absolutely Alexandre
says John what's your recommendation for
the sunset palette I don't own it so I
can't recommend it I'm sorry miss Josh
Stone says I would I would trust
Stephanie on skin care more I can see
your point on that I can definitely see
your point on that Angela says Sunday
Riley's lactic acid is worth every cent
Sydney of the silence says I'm with
Stephanie Julie says I will never be
without C firma
Lynette says it's in my price range but
it's still expensive I used the baby
facial twice a week I do have the baby
facial I was scared to use it last night
I decided to use the night serum instead
it because the baby facial freaked me
out I've read it and I was like Oh
Joanne wants to know the color of the
Marc Jacobs blush it is in silent not
sale at night night fever and hot stuff
is what it actually is not silent night
Erin says visi art changed my life Oh
Alison says off topic can you do a
review on julep that is a kind of off
topic I guess but I would love to do a
julep brand review I own so much stuff
from julep
I've been trying it for years so I
really feel like I could do a really
good solid julep brand review it's on my
list of things that I definitely want to
do thank you for this for the suggestion
else and I appreciate it
melissa says I trust Stephanie on
everything given her background
Stephanie is amazing like I seriously I
wish she didn't live all the way across
the country because she is so like she's
my people she's got this dry sense of
humor that is just she's hilarious it's
I don't think she realizes how funny she
is that's the thing is like she's she's
so fun to hang out with and I don't
think she has any idea how awesome she
that's crystal says polished choice you
recommend is awesome yeah I still love
my polished choice stuff absolutely
Ashley says Oh Hendrickson
I haven't are Heinrichs in I haven't
tried a lot of oh hi I'm Heinrichs and
stuff but I definitely would love to in
the future
Anna says I love the drunk elephant
facial oil I want to try some cheaper
ones though yeah you know they in the
baby facial they give a little vial of
it it's like this little little
tiny vial because you're supposed to you
can mix in the baby facial or the night
serum of the day serum with the oil and
it's this tiny one so I was like well
maybe I'll buy a full size of it it's
$50 but considering that I have got all
of the other stuff in PR I might want to
go to Sephora say I might invest in the
full-size of that so that I can use the
products the way that it's recommended
by drunk elephant I may purchase that
banshee news says I like Stephanie
Nicole but she has dry skin so I cannot
use a lot of the products that she likes
yeah and I think that that's one
disadvantage I think we all have as
reviewers is that we only have one skin
tone we only have one skin type so it's
hard to give general recommendations on
certain products we just have to give
recommendations on the best that we can
Alexandra says ordinary has the same oil
really interesting why should look into
that
Alexandra Oh a different Alexander we've
got Alexandra and now we've got
Alexandria the drunk elephant Sephora
stats are the best way to try it out
nice Mimi says the leaf aqua bomb I love
the belief aqua bomb I am with you a
hundred percent on that Mimi that is a
fantastic product really really
hydrating I mean it just like it soaks
into your skin and just it's so good I
am totally with you on that one
somebody says Sunday Riley blocked them
on what oh here we go Marissa Sunday
Riley blocked me from their Instagram
because I asked my silicones are in
their new foundation what did you word
it in a way that they could be offended
or something Wow
I they're a silicon is is one of those
things that it either um you know people
either really like it or they really
really really don't and I think it
depends on skin type a lot I mean
silicones the purpose of them from my
understanding is to help it with the
slip to help it to kind of give you that
soft application and the soft feeling so
I would imagine that would be why that's
the way I would answer you Marie if I
was over Sunday Riley and if that was
accurate wow I can't believe a block
oh my gosh lisa says the drunk outfit
marula is $90 cleany i know it's
ridiculous Michelle says Peter Thomas
Roth has great skincare
I tried their toner I was using it for a
while that's the bird my face like not
bad not like the Juice Beauty stuffed in
yeah the Juice Beauty stuff not like
that stuff but the but that stuff was
intense the white it's like a white
bottle
it was billion had black letters going
down the side that toner was crazy man I
use it for a while though I liked it mr.
Ashton says willing to splurge on the
marula since it's working so well
compared to anything else I used on my
eyes relieved my dryness and crepeiness
nice very cool k Shogun says I really
like it cosmetic skincare I haven't
tried any it cosmetics skincare I've
checked out the ingredients for it
Cosmetics kind of reminds me of the
philosophy skincare at least the ones
that I've looked at I haven't looked at
all of them obviously but they didn't
look like they had really great
ingredients but I could totally be wrong
on that stephanie says Peter Thomas Roth
firm ex peeling gel for the win good to
know Lori says the juice beauty stuff
burned her - oh my gosh it wasn't just
me then
alright I should probably pop off here
because my family is going to the mall
we're at an hour in 3 minutes so I
should probably get off here even though
I'm really really really enjoying this
conversation we will have to come back
next weekend again just a reminder no
chat no what's the makeup because I
won't be here I'll be in New York and
with John we're going to I'm at if you
happen to go to I match in New York and
you're there on Saturday and you see me
please come up and say hi don't be like
don't worry about like I would love to
hang out I'd let you know hang and we'll
pint I hang out can you probably got
stuff to do but you know give you a hug
take a picture something like that so I
like to collect pictures of meeting
people one so that I can remember when
people comment I can remember your face
to go along with your name because you
know it's nice to get to know people and
to see you know put the faces with the
with the comments it's it's really nice
so if you see me definitely come up and
say hi and I you know I'm enjoying going
IMATS I really really enjoy it I know
some youtubers can't go - I'm at
it's one of the downsides to having a
really huge channel is that big
youtubers just aren't allowed to go
because they grow they draw too much of
a crowd I don't think that I am at that
level so I am I think that everything is
gonna be good for IMS this year you
never know it's gonna have in the future
but you know I I feel like things are
gonna be good this year so I'm holding
on to IMAX as long as I can because I
really do love going to IMS and I'm
gonna be meeting up with Georgia Harris
if you know who she is I'm gonna be
hanging out with her some hopefully get
to hang out a little bit with royal
Beauty Christy a little bit and then
there's another person that I don't
think has announced that she's going
that I'm gonna be hanging out with as
well and I we want to do some live
streaming from I'm out so make sure you
keep an eye on the channel this coming
weekend for some livestream stuff from
IMATS
