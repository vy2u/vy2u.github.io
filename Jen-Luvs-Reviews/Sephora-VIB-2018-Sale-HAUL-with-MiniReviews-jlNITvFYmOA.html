reference but anyway I you know I got to

appropriate hi everybody oh my goodness

much for being here Serafina and
Rasheeda and Amanda and Kristin and
Amber and Lisa and Bonnie and spa Volta
and Angela's again I write Consuelo and
Whitney and Mae thank you so much for
being here I'm gonna try to chat as
little as possible because I I know that
these are kind of these are more
informational rather than discussion
based but I do want to just respect the
people here in the collective brain
thank you so much for being here and
thank you for watching us on the replay
so these are the things that I got and I
do have many review kinds of one-week
trials of these products
I've been trying them for about a week
so I've got some first impression is I'm
not ready for like full-on review
thoroughly tested but I can give you
some like impression city says I look
beautiful thank you oh this a bet by the
way just you know what's on my lips I've
got some covergirl lip products on my
lips right now that video is coming up
hopefully next week I'm gonna film
another video of lip swatches today I
have to do them on different days or
else my lips will go crazy so I already
film the first one and then now I have
to lip swatch videos left and then I
have to do like the actual review of the
products I haven't filmed yet so that's
coming my video with Emily is
on Thursday so that video will be next
week along with another video that was
similar to the one that would came out
today on the crayon case totally not
intentional that these were so close
together but I just want to get the
other one out of the way and over with
I'm just so done with that topic so on
my eyes today I actually have I'm trying
out I have my boxycharm video I stuff to
do what's the 24th I solve my monthly
favorites I have to do so this is
actually the boxycharm and pure palette
on my eyes right now and then I used one
of my Sephora products that I got on
this side and then no eyeshadow primer
on this side just so you know so I add
this I just this is very freshly applied
so I'm curious to see how this wears the
day I've worn some of the other colors I
haven't learned these colors yet so I am
I'm looking forward to seeing how this
wears but I like literally just put it
on so that's why it looks so fresh okay
so let's talk about the things that I
bought so this is the first thing that I
bought I almost didn't get this they
didn't have this out for display so I
had written it off and then the woman at
the counter was like is there anything
that you didn't find that she won and I
was like well you know I heard really
good things about the to face life's a
festival palette I didn't get it because
of the unicorns that's why I didn't buy
it initially was cousin you points I'm
just done with unicorns but then people
were telling me how amazing it was so I
picked it up so I've used this about
three times at this point I haven't used
it a whole lot and it's fun to play with
is it my favorite palette ever do I like
it as much as you the chocolate gold no
do I like it better than some other Too
Faced palettes yes I think she faces
going in a really good direction with
this formula there there's some fun duo
chromey shades in here that are really
cool and I'm very glad they included
these here are you see if you can see
the shifts in there and kind of go back
see maybe it'll focus on my hands will
it with it fit yes
so there's just like this guy right here
is really really fun this one let me put
some put it on my hand so you can see
but I mean I love that they're trying to
do something different it makes me so
happy I just wish it wasn't you in a
corner but you know I mean you can't
have everything it's just the outer
packaging the shades inside or what
really matter but like there's some
really cool shifts in there and I'm so
glad to faces going this direction and
it makes me really happy cuz
love me some dual Chrome's lasting
Howard has been pretty good again not as
good as the chocolate gold but so far so
good I do like it
I don't love it but I like it and I will
most likely keep it okay moving on to
something that I only tried once and I
don't like it so far but I want to try
it more it's not on it's not over yet
not a real lisa says it's just so bulky
I agree it is kind of bulky I am live
right now for Russia I'm gonna say I
hope I got that right you're around
everywhere and I want to say your name
right okay so this is one of the newer
it's not brand new but new with newer
Tarte chrome paints and these caught my
eye right away I had bought the palette
the smaller palette that had like the
circles inside it and had those blue
rocky things on the top if I wasn't live
I would insert a picture but I had
bought that and I really loved that and
I was hoping this was the same formula
so I got this shade this one is in froze
a Frost's a Sante it's got kind of like
a L'Oreal infallible or Giorgio Armani
kind of set up here with a little
plastic stopper and then this is the
shade this was the one that called to me
the most I think they're like 22 or 23
dollars each they're kind of expensive
so I only bought one and I swatch this
and I was like yeah see it's like I've
got a gold shift it's beautiful it
transferred so bad onto my brow bone so
I want to try this with like glitter
glue with something try to make it work
but so far I really really wished that
this didn't transfer up onto my brow
bone but if I can work with it I will
keep it but so far no oh steps I slowed
down you're talking so fast and making
me nervous I'm sorry
sorry Steph so anyway sorry today has
been a day I've been rushing around all
day so I apologize I will bring it down
bring it down a notch Thank You Steph
for saying that you're so kind to me
I love constructive criticism because it
helps me to be better I wish everyone
felt that way but anyway so this one is
a maybe so far because of the
transferring I am so sorry okay so now
let's get into sorry if I just yelled in
your ear Oh people with headphones so I
got this because I had seen somebody use
this on I don't know a tutorial
somewhere this is the Makeup Forever
aqua XL color paint and this is the
shade m-52 it's a matte cream shade and
I've been using this as kind of an
eyeshadow base but it doesn't seem to be
going on very smooth with my fingertips
so if you have any suggestions on how to
apply this whether you apply it over
primer i've been using it instead of
primer if that's wrong definitely let me
know so I can use it correctly but I do
I this one I'm still on the fence about
I'm not sure because it does seem to be
breaking up I don't know I don't know AJ
everything's going good good she says
that I'm her hearing is still good she's
wearing headphones and I'm not blowing
out her readers that's good okay so yeah
so I'm not quite sure about this slowly
challenging okay the rest are all
complexion products and let's do the one
that I don't like so far I've only used
this twice this is the NARS natural
radiant long wear foundation I'm
realizing now as I'm saying this was
this the one with alcohol in it because
this is accentuating every fine line I
have every dry spot that I have it is
just I think it might be now I'm
thinking about it this one might be let
me look real quick I have to look
natural radiant long wear foundation I
want to know the ingredients are you
there are you I'm coming for you I'm
gonna be so mad I'm definitely going to
return it if this is the one with the
denatured alcohol in it cuz I have the
box upstairs ah there's no there's no
ingredients here
there's no ingredients what
what no I have to find the ingredients
why ASL does okay it was the YSL I think
I was thinking about I think you're
right I think it was the YSL because I
like I've been noticing recently I've
been using the drunk elephant skincare
and I've been noticing recently some
like fine line texture on my cheeks no
it was like no I'm not ready for fine
lines on my cheeks yet give me another
10 years I'm just so not ready so um let
me see yeah the box is upstairs I'll
have to look I'll put it in the video
description if I can find it because I
left upstairs I'm not gonna drag you all
the way upstairs but I'll put it in the
video description cuz I do have the box
still oh my goodness mmm
but yeah this is like I don't know if
you can see the texture but it's
accentuating every bit of texture I did
use I got the Kat Von D primer and IMATS
which we'll talk about in the IMATS haul
I used that along with this and it broke
up badly so I decided today I wasn't use
any primer still breaking up really
badly so we will see we will see and
catch your breath Beauty says that
foundation is yucky and transfer all
transfers all over Oh No okay alright
two more products I also got to go along
with that this of course is raved about
all over the Internet's this is the
radiant creamy concealer by NARS this is
raved about almost as much if not the
same amount as the heart-shaped tape and
I really want to try this so far so good
on this I've really been enjoying this
this I mean I've used this maybe four
times at this point and really really
been liking this so still not a full
review yet but so far so good I like
this much better than the foundation so
far okay Lu how am I gonna a slow low
let Ford says I tried the NARS - and
didn't like it while I'm not alone then
I'm not alone that Oh Todd Tong I think
it's Tong my favorite concealer my
favorite beauty product oh good Claudia
loves it too and then Sarah says she
can't live without the NARS radiant
creamy concealer Oh Courtney is here
from fear and Nick she says I think
something the Kat Von D lock concealer
is better than the NARS radiant creamy
okay good to know
good to know thank you so much for that
all right what shade on my Yale says and
thank you beauty as science I appreciate
that she someone makeup is made and say
thank you
I got Vienna for the foundation and then
for the concealer I have vanilla and
that's why I love doing this with the
collective brain that way I don't forget
anything this however I have been really
liking this a lot this is the Sunday
Riley the influencer I've worn this I
think three times maybe four times three
times somewhere in there
really like this really really really
like this this has a nice smooth finish
this one is supposed I believe it's more
coverage where this one is more skin
like aware for me I don't need a lot of
coverage so I'm ok with that
I've really been liking us I've really
been liking the wear of it it doesn't
seem to be accentuating anything but
really enjoying this and I was surprised
that this had a reasonable price point I
was expecting with Sunday rally this was
gonna be a $70 foundation it's not and I
think part of it is that they went with
a low cost packaging with the tube here
but I still think it looks sleek and
nice even though it's a tube even though
it's a less expensive packaging and I
would rather have less expensive
packaging then to pay extra to be
completely honest and I have been really
enjoying this so far again this is not a
full review yet I don't count three
times as being enough trial I like to
try it a lot more so was that anna says
i got a sample of it i'm going to try it
tomorrow definitely come back to this
video and let me know what you thought
if you've tried any of these products
definitely leave those in the comments
because i want to know what you think as
well and then that is it for my support
haul those are all the things i got all
the things and stuff and stuff and
things
so my receipt here I ended up spending
all of that together was a hundred and
eighty-nine dole hairs that's what my
kids are saying lately I think the gamer
gamer people are saying doll hairs
lately so $189 hairs I had some return
gift cards that I use though so that
really helped me to be able to stomach
it and then I ended up yeah subtotal was
178 and
oh did she add the oh no no no no oh
yeah that was after taking all the
percentage off was 189 cuz we had we
have 6% sales tax here so yeah so so far
we'll go through a quick run-through
real quick so far really really liking
this so far really really not liking the
NARS foundation of the Sunday rally was
the thing that I'm really liking so far
leaning toward not liking the Tarte
chrome paint not really sure about the
Makeup Forever aqua XL I'm still playing
with it I think I might not be using it
right I'm not sure he's out on that
one's really liking the NARS concealer
so far and the Too Faced festival
palette I am liking I am not loving but
I am liking and I'm liking the direction
the Too Faced is going in so that is my
haul I hope that you enjoyed it
hopefully nice faster video with 13
minutes this is a fast video for me I'd
love to put more shorter content out on
