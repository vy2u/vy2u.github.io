the K where we test out Korean beauty
products to the side whether they're
worth your hard earned money today we're
not testing a Korean beauty product
because I messed up so today instead of
testing a Korean beauty product which is
what I thought this was when I purchased
it we're going to be testing a Chinese
knockoff of an American product because
apparently I'm an idiot who impulse buys
things and then doesn't double-check
stuff but I said we were going to review
this this week so we're doing it and I'm
quite disappointed in my heart at myself
for this I got it because I thought they
might be worth your investment let's
just talk about what this is these are
called shadow shields and I got them at
the born pretty store which is an online
store that's based in China that I
really really like for nail tools they
have my Holy Grail nail stamping place
if you've never heard of nail stamping a
link an old video of mine down below
that is all about nail stamping I used
to be super addicted to it I still
really like it it's just a little time
consuming but anyway I've shopped at the
born pretty store so many times and I
decided to go get this stuff for what
the guy on there I just you know with
impulse buying it was late at night you
ever do that like it's like midnight and
you really should be going to bed but
you don't feel like going to bed you
just impulse shops for some dumb stuff
yeah that's pretty much what I did so
this is one of the things that I got
along with some unlabeled lint masky
thingies and I don't even know what this
thing is and this thing that you do
something like this with
I don't even know I don't even know
impulse buying at midnight is a stupid
idea I don't know why I did that so
anyway that led me to getting this it
was a dollar twenty nine for ten shadow
shields so I looked at the font and it
actually looks like it's a ripoff of
this product right here that can be
found at lots of drugstores
I looked up if you can get them on
Amazon they're twenty seven cents each
for the real ones these ended up being
about thirteen cents for each shield
with this deal but there are Chinese
knockoff so I don't know if this is
going to be the same as the one you can
get that the American version or not you
know we're just going to try these and
I'm totally mad at myself right now you
can get the American version like
Ricky's NYC Canada Sephora actually
sells them and Namie sells them in
California but you know these are them
it's the same font and it says be
fearless be flawless be smudge free
which is what they have on the shadow
shields the real American one don't tell
my dentist I just did that she'd be very
upset with me this is what they look
like they definitely don't look like the
American version I'll show you the
American version here
they're very similar but they're a lot
larger and then what you're supposed to
do with these as it says you're supposed
to remove the top corners of the backing
and apply the shield to the eye and then
you apply your eye makeup and it's
supposed to prevent fallout on your
cheek as you're applying me the shadow
and it says when finished gently remove
the shield to dispose and it says step
four is hello flawless I'll put a
close-up of the packaging up there so
you can see so we're going to go ahead
and try these I've been I was wearing
makeup earlier if you were in live chat
it's Sunday if you were in live chat
with me and Johnny Depp you saw that I
had eyeshadow on I just took it off for
this video but one thing I want to do is
I want to reapply my concealer because I
want to see whether this will remove my
concealer just going to put on a dot of
shape tape on each side whoa totally
mess because I'm not even looking at
myself right now
and just blend that out
and then I'm going to set it with some
of the balm Spoto balm this is their
powder foundation so what better product
to use to create a ton of Fallout than
the lorac mega pro 3 lorac shadows are
notoriously very powdery and that they
kick up a lot of powder but they're also
very pigmented so I thought that would
be a great shadow to test with this to
see if it protects from the mess so
we're going to remove the plastic
backing and it's got two pieces a big
one and a small one and then we are
going to apply and we're going to just
stick this right under the lash line and
kind of curve it up so that it will
create a nice little wing when we're
done
it is kind of messing with my vision a
little bit because it's kind of
squishing my lid like my lower lid so
it's kind of covering my eye so it's
making it kind of difficult to see I'm
going to take this off pouch
yeah totally remove the concealer that
does not feel good think I applied it a
little too high so let's try again I'm
going to angle it again so that I can
create that nice C it's not I wish it
went up a little bit here and it's the
stickiness is really sticky so it's
making it difficult for me to kind of
see through my eye like it's impeding my
vision a bit but we're just going to go
for it right now I'm very uncomfortable
it feels horrible on my face because
it's really really sticky I'm just going
to use about a couple brushes here but I
don't care cuz I'm taking this off right
after the video and the idea is that I'm
making a huge mess let's start with a
little transition action we're going to
go way too dark on the transition we're
going to go with walnut' open the crease
I'm not going to top off my brush I'm
just going to load it up we're going to
bam-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam bring them hmmm
and because the idea behind this is you
should be able to apply your eyeshadow
like a hot mess and it should still come
out beautiful let's go ahead and put
rose quartz all over the lid
not going to chop it off and I'm just
going to smack that all over there we go
and now we're going to go with jet black
over at the outer corner alright why am
i chopping it off because I have a habit
of doing that and we're just going to
put that over there pink cream all over
the brow bone we'll do a little bit of
snow in the inner corner smacking it all
on doesn't matter I guess I got to
applaud you the other side huh so let's
do it without the shadow shield on the
other side and see what would have
happened I'm going to I'm going to try
to do the exact same thing without the
shadow shielding the other side no
primer I'm going to smack it all over
like it doesn't even matter
wow this shadow look is a hot mess let
me go feel it look good on either side
to be completely honest because I'm just
smacking it everywhere and then a little
snow in the inner corner like two minute
makeup challenge and I think we're done
I really made a mess of myself at night
okay so now let's go ahead and remove
the sticker shield and bam hmm
well there you go
that worked very very well I hate the
eye look it looks awful but you know I
can imagine if I spent more than two
minutes doing this I look this would end
up looking beautiful but could a piece
of scotch tape do the same thing I don't
know I don't have as much fallout on my
face as I thought I would but this
definitely let me pull you up close and
so if you look here on the shadow shield
you can see how much it protected my
face from the fallout I'm not sure if
you can see how much fallout is here
it's actually not as much as I expected
considering how much I was smacking it
all over my face but it definitely
protected my face from fallout you can
see here there
some concealer here so this would be
something you would use before your
concealer and foundation because it does
pick it up but overall I mean it worked
I'm going to see if I go like this
if it actually will just pick up because
it's like tape maybe it'll just pick up
the shadow off of my skin and it
actually picks it up pretty well so does
this stuff work yes it works
do I recommend it no and the reason why
I don't recommend it is because it is a
blatant ripoff of an original company it
was somebody's idea that they took they
replicated it they use the exact same
font they use the exact same name they
use the exact same tagline and they made
it in China which I don't agree with and
if I had realized that I would never
have purchased this so I feel like yes
this works and yes you can feel free to
try it and yes it's cheaper than the
original but I will not be purchasing
these again just because it's not it's
not I don't believe in supporting people
who take other people's ideas for
themselves
like I think that's messed up so I won't
be buying these again even though they
do work but again it's up to you whether
you choose to buy them or not it's
really not that much more expensive to
buy the originals so I don't really see
any reason to get these but it does make
me intrigued to buy the originals and I
think I am going to try the original I
don't know if I will do a full review on
them since I did do this video but if I
do buy them and try them I will put a
note in the description box about it so
I'm not going to give these an official
rating because I don't feel like morally
I can because they lose so many points
for not being the original but then they
gain points for actually working so so
I'm going to just pass on the rating for
this week I'm going to say unable to be
rated because I'm just so morally
conflicted by this product so I want to
thank you so much for watching this is
what the K ish video I hope you enjoyed
it next week we are going to go back
into cave UT we're going to be working
with this come z-pak Eliza Becca milky
piggy this is the 24k mask and it is
supposedly amazing the Amazon reviews on

forward to trying this there's a pig
with a hat and a spoon with some jelly
coming up it's turning into these little
animal thingies and there's this crazy
monster coming out of a shadow of a tree
branch I don't know what to think about
this but I'm really excited to try it
