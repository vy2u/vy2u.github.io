get it when I was younger I was so boy
crazy it was just stupid it's a makeup
channel man there there really isn't
much of a message it's not a secret
everybody and sometimes they wish I'd
shut up about it hello my friends
welcome to the get to know your youtuber
tag I don't know about the title of this
I think it's a little bit cheesy but my
friend flurry tag me in it and I feel
like I haven't done like a
getting-to-know-you video in a really
long time and I have a lot of new
subscribers they may not know the answer
these questions so i figured i would
jump right in because flora tagged me
and I love flora sparks i will link her
channel down below thank you for tagging
me my friend I will also link channels
down below people that I tagged and of
course I tagged you too if you have a
channel she was tagged twice for this
and there's a different set of questions
for each tag so I'm just picking the
ones that I like the best and i will put
the list of the questions down below for
you so number one what is your name my
name is jennifer is my full name that's
what John calls me my middle name is an
i like to leave my last name off of mass
social media number two how old are you
I am 37 years old I will be 38 in June
are you single married divorced how long
I have been married to my husband John
we hit our 10-year wedding anniversary
in july of this past year and you have
any children I have two children I have
a four-year-old named Little John he is
John the fourth and then I have Lyla who
is seven she'll be aight in april okay
my reasons for starring youtube if you
don't know i did have a channel back in
two thousand six and the baby stages of
youtube called jen love 37 there's some
great content over there I will leave
some links to some of my favorite videos
down below that I did over there but i
definitely recommend and go over there
and check it out and see kind of John
and I 10 years ago and what things used
to be like back then it was kind of a
vlogging channel I did some cooking
shows I did a pregnancy vlog for Lila
and it was a great it was a lot of fun
it was a great channel and then I had
Little John and I stopped doing that so
I ended up having to create a new
channel because i knew i didn't really
want to vlog anymore the channel content
was very scattered didn't really want to
know what I wanted to do with it and
Marlena from makeup geek was one of my
favorite things to watch ever you know
her channel and so I said you know what
maybe I'll do something like that I
didn't feel like I could do tutorials
the way she could but I knew I could
review things and I knew I loved makeup
so I decided to kind of get into things
from there so this channel has been
around for three years what does my
username mean now you may not have
noticed no one's brought it to my
attention thing notice but it used to be
Jen loves reviews with an apostrophe
because of my old channel was Jen love
37 I was over there called jen love and
where that came from initially was that
I had an email address I was trying to
think of an email address to have and I
came up with Jen love as an email
address I don't know why so gen la 3737
came from Kevin Smith I'm not sure if
you know the director Kevin Smith but
there's a joke about 37 that's
inappropriate for me to say on this
channel but there's a joke about 37 and
his movie clerks the 37 was a very
special number to me when I created that
channel because it was a huge Kevin
Smith fan I was really big into his
message board over there and the
community over there and it was it was
kind of the beginning of Internet
communities and i started in that
community in the year 2000 randomly back
back in the day v stages of the internet
and then when i brought it over here i
wanted to keep jen love so I wanted to
do reviews and I didn't want to be
limited to makeup reviews so it became
Jen loves reviews now a lot of people
gave me a lot of flack for misplacing my
' people that came to the channel that
were new didn't understand that my name
was jen love and it was a possessive
noun that I was owning the reviews that
they were my reviews they saw it as Jen
loves l.o.v.e s reviews and they didn't
get the apostrophe you're wrong how can
you be a teacher and put the Pasha fee
in the wrong place like so i ended up
recently just getting rid of my ' um and
just letting it be and just being that I
love reviews just because it's easier
that way you know it's easier just to
not have to explain
you have a name that's difficult for
people to read and understand you know
exactly where I'm coming from probably
even more than what I've had to deal
with when did you get passionate about
makeup I started getting passionate
about makeup when I started my channel
I've always really liked make up my mom
used to sell Avon when I was little and
I used to love playing with her little
mini lipstick samples and she's always
give me things to try I remember putting
on bright pink lipstick and just loving
it and the other thing about makeup is
that I've never been artsy I've never
been one that enjoyed drawing or you
know making things off the top of my
head you know like just creating
something out of nothing I've always
needed some kind of template in order to
be artistic you know I was little I made
pot holders and paint by number and
things like that where I had a lot of
help in order to create art now with
makeup I feel like my face is kind of my
template you know I kind of know where
everything is and kind of a basic idea
of where everything goes but then I can
go out of my comfort zone and try
something a little bit new just to kind
of take myself out of my comfort zone
and I love the way my face is
transformed when I put makeup on it's
just fun and it's it's like kind of my
artistic outlet what is the best thing
about YouTube the best thing about
YouTube not no question about it is
getting to know people and learning from
other people as you probably know with
my channel I'm very big on community
it's really important to me the whole
collective brain of makeup awesomeness
all learning from each other and
creating that community aspect is so
important to me it is critical and key
to the essence of my channel the the
interaction with people who watch and me
and people who watch and each other so
important to me that's why i love
periscope and i love Instagram and I
love Twitter and I'm starting to get
into a little bit of snapchat all
username Jen loves reviews and and it's
just fun to interact with people and get
to know people and to hear different
points of view on things and to learn
from other people I that is definitely
the best part of you to the worst thing
about YouTube you know honestly I can't
think of a single thing that's the worst
thing about YouTube honestly like even
haters even people that leave negative
comments they've helped me to grow as a
person like and I'm not just saying that
like they've really helped
me to not take things so personally to
be able to take what they say as far as
you know she always wears the same ayah
log which shows all of these beautiful
you know colorful palettes and she
always wears the same eyeshadow so I've
been experimenting more with color
thanks to that comment you know they're
the comments about you know you're doing
this wrong it's at it you know you're
you're stupid you don't know how to do
this you're you're you're dumb you know
and it's like I've gotten that some
people just don't get it and they just
don't get me and that's okay it's it's
not a knock against them it's just it's
okay to have people not understand you
and not understand what you're trying to
do and that's something that has been
really difficult for me to grasp in any
other context the people on YouTube that
have left negative comments have taught
me how to find that inner piece of that
it's okay if someone else has a problem
with me and there's nothing wrong with
that and it's a bit and I can deal with
that now where I wouldn't have gotten
that if it weren't for those hate
comments so honestly I can't think of a
single thing that I don't like about
YouTube I really can't ok next one is
due any of your friends and family know
that you have a youtube channel
everybody knows I have a youtube channel
I don't keep it quiet anymore I used to
kind of keep it on the down low
especially at work and not really say
anything but at this point it's like
whatever like one of my students last
year found my youtube channel and went
around telling everybody well first she
didn't and then she told one person who
told another person who told another
person and I don't think she meant for
it to get out but it did so now a lot of
the students know I have a youtube
channel if you're watching hi so I mean
my channel was always appropriate for
younger viewers so I didn't really have
to worry about getting in trouble for it
but you know now at this point everybody
knows my family knows my co-workers no
it's not a secret everybody knows and
sometimes they wish I'd shut up about it
the next one is where do you see
yourself in five years and I see myself
still doing YouTube i don't know if i'll
still be doing makeup reviews in five
years I honestly don't know I would like
to review lots of different things
eventually I'd like to do I'd like to
have another channel at some point I'd
love to start another vlog channel as
some of you might know I am planning on
hopefully stopping teaching at the end
of the school year to do YouTube full
time that is
not set in stone yet hopefully it'll be
set in stone soon but I want to make
sure that this is definitely something I
want to do because once i put my
paperwork in they start trying to find
somebody to replace me and I'm just not
quite ready for that yet it's a perfect
fit for what I've always wanted to do
I've always wanted to be in front of a
camera I've always wanted to be a
teacher I've always wanted to get to
know lots of people all over the world I
mean and YouTube is that that's what
YouTube is for me and it's it's my
perfect job it's my dream job and I'm so
thankful to be able to do it i mean at
this point I'm not making a living off
of it but thankfully my husband makes
enough money to cover me and then
hopefully one day I will be able to make
a living off of it hopefully in five
years i'll be making enough money that's
an actual salary of a regular person
that's higher than minimum wage where I
make now significantly lower than
minimum wage all right the next one is
what message am I trying to get across
in my videos you know honestly like it's
a makeup channel man there there really
isn't much of a message I guess in my
chat videos I'm trying to get across
that community aspect and how women can
really help each other and build each
other up but in a negative review there
really isn't much other than I'm trying
to save you some money girlfriend that
that's what I'm trying to get across is
I'm either trying to tell you buy
something because it's amazing or I'm
trying to tell you don't buy something
don't waste your money but is that a
message not really but I mean I think
that community aspect is definitely
embedded in my channel of we really need
to help each other as women I think as
women we have sometimes in our nature to
tear each other down in order to help
ourselves build ourselves up and it's
just so so toxic so incredibly toxic you
know I want to fight against that as
much as possible and help women to see
that we can build each other up and feel
good about doing it what other interests
you have besides makeup right now I just
mostly I'm taking care of my kids and
I'm working as a teacher full-time as a
teacher I am a resource teacher so my
job is basically to go around the
building and help kids in any way that
they need help whether it's in a way
that they're struggling and they're
having trouble or maybe it's kids that
need things a little bit more difficult
than what's being presented in the
classroom whatever it is my job is just
to go around the building help all
different kids
all different grades and it's definitely
my favorite education job that I've ever
done so those that's pretty much my only
interests that's all I have time for
it's keep it to my full-time job of my
kids and my husband of course that's
really all I got something odd about me
um one thing it's not really odd but
it's something that you might find
interesting for Christmas I got a
ukulele for Christmas and my dream is to
teach myself to play the ukulele or have
someone teach me how to play the ukulele
I feel like that's like my dream
instrument and I played it at least an
hour a day for the first two or three
weeks after I got it and then I abandon
it so hopefully one day I'll be able to
pick my ukulele back up and and make
some more progress on it because that's
something I really really want to be
able to do I want to be able to play
Enter Sandman by Metallica on the
ukulele that is like my dream and I know
that's weird but that's what I want to
be able to do 18 in life by skidrow on
the ukulele like how epic would that be
it would be epic I want to be able to do
that one day favorite TV show
supernatural absolutely and pretty
little liars and I've recently been
watching Mozart in the jungle on amazon
prime so those are kind of my three
shows right now what do you do on most
days most days I get up in the morning I
get ready on periscope I go to work I
work all day I come home I start
prepping dinner i turn on my periscope I
make dinner I put the kids to bed I edit
youtube videos that's my day that's what
I do every single weekday it's pretty
much what I do or I do things for my
job' job if I'm not editing youtube
videos I'm you know doing things to plan
for my job and on the weekends i'm
typically working on what's up in makeup
hanging out with my kids taking my kids
to birthday parties things like that if
you weren't disney princess who would
you be Anna from frozen I would be on ax
because when I was younger I was so boy
crazy it was just stupid I was just that
was all I thought about was boys and she
just she's like my soul princess like me
and her we we are like of the same like
I would totally have picked the guy that
would have killed me like that would
have been me thankfully that never
happened to me but you know that I
picked some real doozies just like on it
did before I met John oliana meets her
soul may do favorite beauty product I
don't really have a
favorite beauty product my favorite
Beauty category is eyeshadow followed
closely by eyeliner by liquid eyeliner
but I don't really have a favorite
beauty product there's too many good
things to mention if I had to pick one
thing I would probably say my Too Faced
chocolate bar palette favorite perfume I
go through so many different perfumes
but viktor and rolf flowerbomb is
definitely up there marc jacobs daisy is
up there DKNY be delicious is up there
those are kind of my three favorites
right now favorite song you're going to
make fun of me hard but I am such a
Justin Bieber fan it's not even funny
not of him as a person but of the music
that other people have made him sing
because you know that kid did not make
up any of those songs but Justin Bieber
music I'm addicted I'm addicted my most
listened to playlist on pandora is the
teen station I love like a teenybopper
music like I could listen to Taylor
Swift and Justin Bieber all day long and
the last one randomly his favorite
lipstick my favorite lipstick formula is
a two-faced look creme lip sticks and my
favorite shade is pink chocolate it's
like a more solid color and it's
gorgeous and I love it I'm wearing
Lolita on my lips today by Kat Von D
which I also really really like ok so
there's um pink chocolate here's Kat Von
D's lolita next to it you'll see it's in
the same color family and then popped in
the center to kind of give it that ombre
kind of look I have this nude stick
shade which is in the shade whisper and
I just kind of pop that in the center to
kind of pop my lips out so really I love
anything that's like these shades all my
lipsticks everything that I actually
where is all some kind of range from
nude to very dark like this there they
all fall there so I guess anti-climactic
Lee that's my tag I hope you learned a
little bit more about me as a person I'd
love to do an actual QA in the future
I'm trying to figure out how exactly I
want to do that I'm so new to snapchat
that I don't really have a lot of
followers on snapchat so if you want to
follow me on snapchat that may be a way
maybe through Instagram and snapchat we
can get some questions going
I'm not officially doing that yet I will
let you know on social media when that's
going to start so that I can get the
flood questions for an actual Q&amp;amp;A maybe
