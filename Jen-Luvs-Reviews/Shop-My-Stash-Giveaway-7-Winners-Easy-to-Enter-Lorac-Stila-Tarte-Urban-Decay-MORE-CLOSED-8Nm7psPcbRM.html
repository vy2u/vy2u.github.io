hello my friends I am so excited today
oh my goodness and the reason why I'm
excited cuz we're doing a giveaway I
haven't done a giveaway in a really long
time like a really really really long
time I did best in beauty and I gave
away a bunch of stuff for that but it
wasn't quite a giveaway this is a really
really awesome giveaway and it's it's
like no other giveaways which is that
hardens fun it's like no other giveaways
that i have seen on youtube it is a shop
my stash giveaway there's going to be
seven winners instead of doing a bunch
of prizes all for one person I'd rather
spread it all out so that more people
can win something I'm going to put a
list here of all of the different brands
of products that i have in my stash and
this is how it works i'm going to be
giving away two lip glosses i'm going to
be giving away an eyeshadow a 2
eyeliners a mascara and a skincare item
so in order to win it is very easy i
will not make you be friends with me on
facebook i will not make you follow me
on instagram follow me on twitter and
follow me on keek and follow me on all
i'm not making you do all that ok
there's no extra entry is there's none
of that it's just simple you're going to
figure out which of those five
categories you would like to win and
then you're going to type comments down
below so let's say you want to win all
five you're going to hit type in mascara
posts eyeshadow post eyeliner posts lip
gloss posts they didn't care posts they
must be in each line because what I'm
going to do is I'm going to put them
make sure everybody's only voted one
time per user names that's another rule
one time for username and once I've
realized if you voted one time for using
a per user name per item then i'm going
to put separate everybody out into their
little categories and then i'm going to
put it into random.org and we're going
to figure out who wins the fabulous
glorious prize now how do you know what
you're actually going to win you don't
you don't know exactly
item you're gonna win until you win when
you win I will let you know what my
stash looks like and you will get to
pick from my stash now the very least I
have of a specific kind of item is I
think five so you'll have a choice of at
least five things I promise they will
all be high end but some of them are
deluxe sized samples but i will let you
know that when you win whether it is a
full size or a deluxe i sample i will
let you know the answers you know
exactly what you're getting so there's
no surprise if it's a smaller version or
the full size if you have any questions
about anything feel free to email me at
jen lowes reviews at gmail com or type
it in a comment down below I will be
happy to answer it for you also they'll
be frequently asked questions in the
video description so before you ask your
question make sure you check there first
to see if someone else is alright asked
it and I've already answered it what
I've noticed about my giveaways is that
in about two weeks they're pretty much
dead no one's really entering anymore so
we're gonna give this one exactly two
weeks from this day which will be that
day right there and on that day I will
close the the entries and i will put i
will contact the winners i will also put
the winners in the description box down
below i'll put them in a comment so that
you can check and see if anybody you
know or if you want but i will be
