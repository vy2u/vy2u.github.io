the ciate lash lights mascara and this
one is in the color serene and it is the
purple one let me go ahead and show you
this crazy wand so as you can see it's
almost like a comb it's flat and then
it's got combs on either ends I haven't
noticed any difference in either side
and I'm gonna go ahead and just kind of
show you what it looks like if I just
swatch it on my hand you can see how
bright purple that is so I'm going to go
ahead and show you the application of
this right now
little tomcat stay close to me because
there are clouds on the horizon and a
chill on the breeze we're alone here but
don't you be scared of God a calloused
hand a farmer's tan and am happy to
share
you and I both goodbye just promise you
won't stray all right my friend so I
really really wanted to love this
mascara and I can tell you that I don't
love it I don't feel like it does a lot
on its own I don't feel like on my dark
eyelashes it shows up really at all if
you look really really closely you can
see that my lashes have some purple on
it I've tried it over a black mascara
I've tried it alone and either way I
just don't see the purple in it so I
think what I'm going to do is I'm going
to return this and I'm going to exchange
it for one of the lighter brighter
colors because I'm hoping that that one
will have more of a pop effect on my
lashes now unfortunately it's now the
end of summer so I don't know how
appropriate blue lashes are gonna be for
winter so and I don't know if it's gonna
be a trend next year so it's one of
those things I don't know maybe I'll
return it just outright and just get my
money back but either way this one is
definitely going back to the store so
