on this one a single luster matte long
wear lip color by Sephora now these
things were all over YouTube right now
they're in everybody's favorites they're
all over the place so I was like I was
in Sephora I was like well I'll pick one
up which shade looks the nicest well I
will get this one and this one is in the
shade petal luster and let me tell you
well let me not tell you let me show you
you
okay so my biggest gripe about this
thing is that it cause on my teeth it
won't get off my teeth it's like my date
after I apply it like once it dries and
once it's like on my lips it's fine but
like right after I apply it it's it's a
mess it's all over the place my hair
sticks to it and I get it on my teeth
and I don't realize is somebody teething
then someone tells me it's on my teeth
long and then after I um get it off my
teeth then I go home and get stuck with
my teeth again like is it stuck on my
teeth right now no cuz it's dry and this
is the only lip product I'm telling you
the only lip product I've ever used in
my entire life that gets stuck on my
teeth the way that this one does
it's just crazy it's weird but honestly
like as long as you're careful of that
as long as you keep an eye on your teeth
it's fine I mean it's a nice product I
like the lasting power the lasting power
on it is great it really lasts I mean
even after eating and wearing it it
lasts a really long time so I need
overall I would recommend this it's just
you've got to be careful your teeth
