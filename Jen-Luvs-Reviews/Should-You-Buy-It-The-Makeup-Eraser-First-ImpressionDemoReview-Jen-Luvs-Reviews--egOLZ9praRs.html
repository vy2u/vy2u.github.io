impression slash review of the original
makeup eraser this was sent to me for
review by a young lady named Kelly and
Kelly is a senior sales director over at
and the makeup array so Kelly was kind
enough to send me one of these bays for
review and this is what it looks like I
did see the graveyard girl who is one of
my favorite youtubers of all time
did do a review of this and loved it so
I am really looking forward to trying it
myself
and seeing whether it works for me now I
will let you know I kind of did
something that maybe maybes not fair -
the makeup eraser I use today the
benefit the eyeliner the push-up liner
that's supposed to be basically
impossible to take off now my Neutrogena
wipes do take it off and it takes it off
pretty easily
so I don't know so we'll see whether the
makeup eraser can do some damage I'll
also put all of the products that I'm
wearing on the face down in the
description so you can see what else
this was able to take off if it does
take it off or what it was not able to
take off so the directions indicate that
you should wash this first so I already
ran it through my wash it's been washed
and now you're going to try it this is a
multi-level marketing thing yeah
basically you can buy a bunch of these
and sell them just like people so you
know Avon and Mary Kay and candles and
all those companies and the 21 bags and
all that stuff so if you think that you
can sell these to your friends then I
will put Kelly's email down below and
you can contact her about selling these
or buying these if you want to buy one
so what's up oh yeah my husband just
it's called 31 not 21 he says he knows
his MLM is better than I do so let's go
ahead and wet this baby and see whether
this one works does the saying about
thatís about this alright so i zoomed
in almost
and I've put warm water on my makeup
eraser and we're gonna see how this
thing works so here we go and one thing
if this works it's gonna be awesome
is all the chemicals that are in my view
Gina wipes freaked me out there are so
many chemicals and that darn thing that
I don't like really like to put all this
chemicals on my face so this works then
that would be just amazing and it does
even take my Neutrogena wipes a little
while to get my eye makeup up
so how would look it look at that I got
look at this close-up and see the
results of this stuff here that is
looking pretty darn good and it even
took off the benefit eyeliner on like
seriously like that is so stinking cool
I can't believe that took off that
eyeliner I still feel like I might have
a little mascara on but I don't know
okay so you can see it took off my lip
product this is the L'Oreal bomb thing
these pop bombs and my mascara is
completely gone like I can feel it it's
like super soft all of my liner is off
my brow powder is off all my foundation
is off
that's pretty stinkin amazing so I'm
gonna go with the other side of it and
I'm gonna do the other side actually you
know what I only hear this is how the
towel looks after using it I mean you
can see that it got caught a key but
this I haven't used this side at all so
I'm just gonna re wet it and I'm going
to just a warm it up a bit and then I'm
gonna do the other side I can't believe
I don't have raccoon eyes
I guess not even giving me raccoon eyes
like I get in the shower
and like they use cleanser in the shower
and I it looks to my makeup looks
terrible I can't believe this is taking
us off so well unbelievable I'm Tania
and I swear they're not paying me
anything
all he did was give me this towel and
say hey when you try it and I said sugar
I don't get a cut of the sales nothing
and you're watching it happen I can't
fake this and you can watch bunnies to
graveyard girls
and there's no chemicals on here or
anything it's just a WoW like I don't
get it that it's crazy
so there's my face with no makeup and it
feels good too it's like super soft I'm
not gonna question it I just know that
this thing works
hundred percent polyester who knew in
that a piece of polyester would take my
makeup off who knew that I didn't know
that now I know so I mean my only thing
is my face does feel like that that just
cleaned feel where I feel like it's a
little bit dry like I need some
moisturizer so there's definitely no
moisturizing effect happening but I mean
how much can it have I mean it's a
stinkin towel but I mean really I got
nothing but love for this product again
this is the makeup eraser and if you're
looking for something to replace your
chemically makeup remover then this
might be something you might want to get
into maybe I'll try so these things are
somehow no because this stuff is amazing
I don't get why it works but it works
alright well I couldn't ramble on about
this and say the same thing over and
over again but I'm just gonna stop now
