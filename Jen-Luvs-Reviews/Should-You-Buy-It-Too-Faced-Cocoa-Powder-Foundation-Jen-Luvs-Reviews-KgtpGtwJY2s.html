the new two-faced cocoa powder
foundation and now let me tell you right
away that this stuff smells exactly the
way you would expect it to smell it
smells just like cocoa powder which is a
wonderful smell to me considering
chocolate is my favorite food in the
entire world so was very excited to get
this and now I don't own the chocolate
bar palette I resisted and I never got
it I just kind of closed my eyes every
time I walked past and so that I
wouldn't have to buy it because I did
not need it so but I did break down and
get this because I am just starting to
get into powder foundations I have just
some a few mineral powder foundations
but I didn't have any pressed powder
foundations so I really wanted to try
this and I am very happy that I did this
has been a wonderful foundation for me
for the end of summer what I like about
this is because I don't have a lot of
redness or darkness on my face I can
just apply this after I put my makeup on
I just put this all over my face and I
don't need to use a powder I can just
use this only it gives me a very light
coverage which has been really nice for
summer and then it covers all of my you
know it just evens out my skin tone and
it's beautiful now is this for somebody
that has redness or darkness no it's
definitely not
at least not stand alone what this is
going to be nice for if you do have
discoloration in your skin is to go over
your BB Creams
to increase the coverage of whatever
foundation you're using so if you
already have a foundation like if you're
using your BB cream and you want to keep
using it through the winter but you want
something that's a little more full
coverage this will make this will kind
of top it off for you and give you a
little bit more coverage it is really
nice if you just need to use a little
bit of concealer works beautifully over
just a little bit of concealer and I
just overall just really love this
product it has a really nice wear time
for a powder foundation I was surprised
I did not see any fading of the powder
for a good six hours which is a lot for
a powder for me it does come with this
little space underneath that I wanted to
show you where it has this sponge here
that you can use for applications so if
you're taking it on the go you can use
this I have not used it yet I would
imagine it works nicely but I have not
used it yep just because I have a
preference for a brush I'm going to go
ahead and show you a clip of the
application of this foundation right now
but overall again very very happy with
this foundation and would recommend it
if you are looking for that kind of
foundation if you're looking for a full
coverage fund a liquid foundation you're
not gonna want this okay but if you're
looking for something to just kind of
deepen up and the coverage of your
foundation or if you like a light
coverage foundation this is great it's
really nice so and it's most like
chocolate so thank you so much for
