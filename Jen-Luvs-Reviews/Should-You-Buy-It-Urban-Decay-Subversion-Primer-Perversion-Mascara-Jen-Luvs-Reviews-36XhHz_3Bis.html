the subversion and perversion mascaras
from urban decay now I know because I
peaked and I was bad I know that a lot
of people are going to be getting at the
Urban Decay perversion and one of the
subscription boxes coming up I won't
tell which one in case you don't want a
spoiler but I did see that in a preview
of what I was getting in mine I wanted
to go ahead and review it and let you
know what I thought of the full size
before I get it in the smaller version
and I'm just going to go ahead and show
you the application of these two right
now
so overall I really honestly don't see a
big point in the subversion primer I
think that it seemed like it was a good
idea it seemed like it was gonna do
something good but honestly it weighed
so heavy on my lashes that I would
definitely not repurchase this I didn't
feel like it made a big enough
difference in the volume of the length
of my lashes for me to repurchase that
now this on the other hand I actually
really really like I like how it
lengthens my lashes I do feel like you
need to kind of cut it off at two coats
because once you get past two coats of
this thing it just makes the lashes go
just complete spider clump together just
enough and I personally don't enjoy that
look it looks beautiful a lot of people
I personally don't like it so so yeah I
mean overall I'm really happy with this
mascara I would recommend it if you're
looking for a more expensive mascara and
I think a lot of your going to get a
chance to try it out if you have
subscription boxes coming to you so I
have to let me know what you think of it
after you try it so thank you so much
