the K where we test out Korean beauty
products and flick our hair and decide
whether they are worth your time and
money today I have encouraged my family
to join me for what the K because Lyla
why what are we trying get them off my
table
like killing a face mask do you know who
those people are oh I love your mountain
before how did you know who they are
long as I remember who are they they're
kind of distance ooh this is sister
Jenna Jenna Jenna Jenna
I bought these off of Amazon beginning
of May but they are still available
there by a brand called the face shop
I've never ordered anything from the
face shop before and the Simpson thing
kind of brought me in my slim son
decided he did not want to be part of
the video so we're just going to have a
Lyla be in the video Lyla which one are
you going to do you know what her name
is
yeah my name is Lisa and I've got large
here and then John has want to be Homer
Homer homers upside down they didn't I'd
rather here's no Bert
they didn't make a Bart it janitor do
the creepy janitor oh yeah and how it's
been good or what was the boss's name
noisy Oh what was the boss's name mr.
Nutter burn mr. Barr mr. Berger and okay
so let me tell you a little bit about
these masks so I got him off the Amazon
the Lisa one was seven dollars and 80
cents for two masks and then the homer
and the Marge ones were seven dollars
and sixty nine cents for two masks that
makes them a little less than four
dollars per map which is very expensive
so these ingredients better be on point
right the only thing it says on the
Amazon link is that it's a slit sentence
collaboration it comes with two masks
you're supposed to pick the perfect size
for your face to the Homer is the large
the Marge is the medium and then the
Lisa is the small it also says it's
formulated without parabens cows mineral
oil or paraffin
all of these masks do contain
phenoxyethanol and fragrance so if you
do not like those you
not want to buy these but there are some
benefits and each map is different I
only went by the top 10 ingredients I
just threw the rest of them out the best
ingredients in the Lisa map are betting
panthenol sodium high alert and glycerin
and for the marge mask we have put it
right here the Marge mass we have
niacinamide Beth pain panthenol sodium
hi learn aid and pomegranate extract and
then in the Homer mask
there's Beth pain pants and all sodium
hyaluronic olive fruit extracts
adenosine and glycerin so lots of really
great ingredients in these so I have
high hopes I have high hopes you may not
see immediate results today but we will
be able to tell you about texture how it
feels and see if we feel any difference
after we use them let's go ahead and
risk these babies open all remember
we're doing this walk it's very easy
gooey there's definitely some serum left
in the package the directions say that
you're supposed to cleanse our face so
we've all cleansed our faces and place
masks smoothly on the entire faith to
fit the curves adjusting around the eyes
nose and mouth remove after 10 to 20
minutes and Pat and the remaining serum
for absorption without even going for 10
to 20 minutes the side of the mass of
the character print is coated place the
face mask with the character print
facing out yep you're doing great you
got that you got it kiddo oh-hoo-hoo
there's got a balls you got to pull the
eyeballs out well your mastery of the
eye goes well my hands are getting lots
of goodness right now oh no there's a
mess a mouth one two you got to pull the
mouth out so we can Punk mm-hmm we went
wait for daddy deeply knows huh no no
the nose can just cut off comb flop down
over your nose I don't understand which
way is the face out because they both
look the same to me but I'm thinking
that this way is the way patient it
definitely has a smell of like clean
emerald latreille didn't care I think
you've got it right kid open Dianne I'm
honey you're doing that yeah let's do it
ready set Simpsons
it's cold and it's cold oh you guys know
how much I love texture on my face so
slowly oh my gosh I think daddy looks
the best and a Khaleesi
I don't like that they made them so that
their faces were sideways like daddy's
definitely looks the best I think I'm
looking at looking to monitor right
there it looks sweet it does this weird
alright it's very cold
what do you guys think it smells like
hmm like women smells fruity and sweet
and floral to me it's being on really
well though I'm surprised at how well
it's staying on last time we did this
together we did monster masks with the
kids and they didn't stay on very well
but I feel like these are staying on and
oh oh oh a good home were used to say
what is it talking about I don't even
know no I'm not some beer now yeah
that'd be good I push it around your
facepage did you do it or push it it's
not staying on it doesn't like fits our
faces nicely and I'm scrolling on yeah
that's good okay so do you think you
guys can keep this on for 10 minutes
yeah we're just going to do 10 minutes
and now we'll see how it goes so let's
go ahead and we will see you in 10
minutes
Rebecca we're back it is officially been
10 minutes we could leave it on for 20
minutes but we got stuff to do things
and things so we can always do it again
because we have enough masks to do again
if we want to on our own times so you
guys ready to remove let us remove and
then we're supposed to rub the serum
into our faces you can just set them
right over here and just rub oh it feels
very slimy you know how much I love
slimy I don't know why me
you like the way it feels I love you
very wet there's lots of products I'm
going to put all my decollete my hands
my decollete this should decollete right
here you're not no it's your decollete
retexe no not like all right it's
starting to disappear now we back with
our of them how do we feel
send your pampered do you feel hydrated
yes so very hydrated you feel sticky a
little a little bit sticky I'll think it
feels like it's not gross sticky no
crying
let's give it a second to dry everybody
dry Tracy so for me personally I feel
like it was just it was a face mask it's
a face mask with lots of good
ingredients in it I feel like it is over
priced at $4 is it ridiculously
overpriced no but and it does have a lot
of good ingredients in it the
ingredients are high up so you are
getting good stuff it's just it's only
one time use you know I mean I
definitely have good ingredients is just
whether you're willing to pay four
dollars for a one-time treatment since
it is I think on Amazon now over eight
dollars for the two masks
I still feel tacky you still feel tacky
for satiny
no money maybe a year for America Sophie
I'm so that was fun did you all enjoy
doing the face mask yeah I enjoyed it
too beer there you go yeah yours didn't
stick very well on your face because
there was it stuck to my face where
