he's supposed to have an i there either
i rubbed off I don't think so that would
be ironic wouldn't it that the I rubbed
off of the product called skin and it's
an eye product I don't know oh we
recorded hi hi I know you you don't know
her though so I'm going to introduce you
to her this is my mom I and I needed my
mom for this video beauty box 5 the
subscription service contacted me and
asked me if I would review this product
this company called skin has this
product in the September beauty box 5
and i'll put the information to stop for
beauty box 5 if you're interested down
below but I've got all this flak for
shooting that new new you by michael
todd anti-aging some people like you're
too young to do this so i was like well
you know what mom you're not as young as
I am so my mom sorry but but you know
but you know what's funny no that's good
because you need to not be as young as
me because that would be weird if you
are my mom that's the same age that
would just be odd that would be odd
weird but if you notice i have more
wrinkles on my forehead than she does so
that's just not fair I don't even know
where the genetics just a rumor dad must
have gotten it from my dad dad it's
always dad's fault that's dad's ball
it's on my fault I think it's because I
expressed myself too much my mom says I
should do face exercises yes face
exercises are very good when you get
wrinkles but what we came here to talk
about was this skin eye cream so I tried
it first and then I pass it off to my
mom so I'm going to show you the
pictures of my eyes the very first day
that I used it I thought I saw an
immediate difference in the fine lines
around my eyes but the more I use it the
more I didn't notice anything so I don't
know if it just worked off the bat and
then it just kind of flatlined and
didn't get any better you know it's it's
really hard because I'd only have these
little fine lines you know and it didn't
make such a huge huge difference that I
could really see this giant difference
in my eyes and then I pass it off to my
mom and I wish
show you the pictures of her now well I
personally thought that it did make a
difference in my face I what soon as I
put it on I felt like I could see less
of my wrinkles right here from the what
he called the crow's feet and smile
lines i felt like i could see less of
that so you have to see what you think
for my pictures she was smart enough to
actually put it on other areas of her
face I've in their eyes because it is an
eye cream so of course I just put it on
my eyes but she has more experience with
this stuff I guess than high chair I do
have a crow's feet and I have a little
bit of under here and I really do think
it's smooth that so I think you'll be
able to tell from the pictures take that
for what you will um if you're my age
I'm 35 and she's a mom's age of someone
who's 35 I won't expose you ma but I
mean I I feel like it's I think it's
like a fifty dollar product something
like that or 40 i'll put the up with the
full price down here for you to see how
by the way when you use it you only use
a tiny little drop a little tiny drop
goes a long way it goes around your
whole oh hi so it's going to last you a
long time if you do i choose to invest
in it it is going to last you a very
long time how many ounces is this this
is a point five out so i enjoyed trying
it yeah for having me try it so using it
and hopefully seeing a big difference i
decided to give it to my mom because it
seemed to work better for her than it
did for me on and thank you to beauty
box 5 for sending to me i really
appreciate it thank you for watching if
