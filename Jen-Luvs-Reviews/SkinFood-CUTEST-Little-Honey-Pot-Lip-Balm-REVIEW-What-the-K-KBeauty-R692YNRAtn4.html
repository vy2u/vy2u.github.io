the K where we test out Korean beauty
products to decide whether they're worth
your time and money today we're gonna be
talking about the skin food honey lip
balm number three the honey flavor and I
got some tea to spill on this honey this
is the honey pot lip balm there's
actually three of these the very ones
number one mandarins number two honey
flavored is number three
I paid $8.75 for this little tiny pot of
lip balm this is now actually on sale
Amazon for seven dollars and 20 cents as
you know Amazon prices can fluctuate a
bit you can also get this on the
skinfood website for $10 so amazon is
the better way to go I did get it
directly from skin-food on Amazon it
also has four and a half stars on Amazon
with 120 reviews which is pretty stinkin
good so I was like yes I want this in my
life they did not have the ingredients
listed from skin-food
on this product and it didn't do a lot
of digging before I got it and I
probably should have this is not the
first time I've had issues with skin
food ingredients last time I reviewed a
skin food product it was their
strawberry mask and I found
discrepancies between the mask that was
sold on Amazon versus the mask that was
sold on ulties website this is not sold
at Ulta I was contacted by skin food and
there is a correction in the description
there that basically they messed up the
ingredients on also website and I said
please contact us and you have any other
issue so I contacted them I have not
heard anything back but I will put
something in the description and now
you're wondering what I contacted them
about we're going to pretend this is tea
so look at the ingredients for this on
skin Foods website and I'm looking I'm
looking I'm like okay textures mineral
oil
we've got Catholic and copper
triglyceride that's a good one butyl
paraben fragrance cool yellow Milt Lake
number 5 ok where's the honey where's
the honey where is the honey
I'm going to put their description of
what this product is on the screen right
now and you'll see here that they do
claim that you do get benefits from
honey in this product but there's no
honey there's no honey listed here some
of their other products do have honey
listed they have honey listed or honey
extract listed
there's nothing listed here and let's
take a second to pause as I was editing
this video I was taking screenshots of
things and I noticed something on the
skin food website that I wanted to
mention you'll notice here that it says
honey and then it gives a description
and then after that it says additional
ingredients before I film this video I
didn't see that it said additional
ingredients meaning I guess that honey
is one of the ingredients and then these
are the rest of the ingredients but that
just seems fishy to me because when you
list ingredients you should list all the
ingredients because how do I know where
honey falls on that list so I decided to
do a little more digging and the only
other place that I could find
ingredients on a sales website was on
the Meany box website and as you can see
here there is no honey listed in the
ingredients so I'm still going to stand
by until I hear from skin-food
that this product doesn't have any honey
in it I'm getting very frustrated with
skin food and the way that they don't
seem to care how the ingredients are
listed for their products as an
ingredient junkie it just really is very
irritating alright so now back to the
rear view and honey might be something
that you would really like to have in a
lip balm I did a little bit of research
on honey itself liz Strong's website
talks about it being a moisturizer for
the skin protecting against damage and
promoting wound healing which would be
great for the lips different honey has
different properties though they say
that the best honey is supposed to be
manuka honey but there's a bunch of
different kinds of higher quality than
other kinds specifically for skin care
on the other skin food honey products
they don't say specifically what kind of
honey they use but honey could
potentially be a very nice ingredient
for this but they ain't no honey in it
just so you know at least that's what
they have listed I mean I looked up all
the scientific names trying to figure
out are they hiding it in some kind of
science that I just don't understand I
can't find it so let me just tell you a
little bit about this product it is
mineral oil based based on the
ingredients and what you do is there's
this little plastic thing here that hold
this little drumette thing and you take
this little plastic piece off and less
you can see that but it just barely
holds that so you can take this really
cute little wooden I don't know what you
call this thing a little wooden thing
and you can pull the product here if
we're going to go ahead and apply with
this but again you can apply with your
fingers if you want to it's just it's
hard especially if you have false nails
or long nails it's going to be hard to
get your finger in this pot because it
is quite small I think I got a little
bit too much a little bit it smells
fabulous it's got a great little flavor
to it a great scent to it it's not
really overpowering in its scent but as
you can see it's just a mineral oil
based shine a lot of lip glosses and lip
balms have mineral oil in them it's not
a fancy ingredient by any means it
doesn't do anything magical as far as
the look of it actually let me zoom you
back out to tell you a little bit more
hold on what you're going to be paying
for with this product is the packaging
I've used this five or six times I've
used it before bed to see if there's a
noticeable difference when I wake up in
the morning and there hasn't been for me
this does have a very high rating on
Amazon so it's possible that someone
else may have some kind of magical
things that this may work what better
for you but this to me wasn't any better
than a $2.00 lip gloss except for the
packaging the packaging is really cute
I do wish there was a way for this
little thingy this little wooden thing
to stick here without that little
plastic piece because I can see this
being lost very easily I am glad they
included that though because it is a
little bit difficult to get your finger
into the pot ah if it was a three dollar
product I would say yay but the fact
that it was an eight dollar product I
think that is very open price for what
you get there's definitely nothing
magical in this product and less in
skin-food somehow has something magical
in it and just didn't happen to include
it in the ingredient list you may know
that I'm about to go on a vacation with
my family to New York and Canada so
there will not be a what the K after
next week but I've got a fun one for you
next week I ordered these off the face
shop on Amazon I
don't know if they're still available or
not I don't think they are but they're
too fun not to do and we're gonna get
the whole family involved next weeks
what the Kay it's going to be epic and
it's these Simpson's face masks I've got
as a homer for my husband
I've got Lisa for my daughter I've got
Marge for me I've also got an extra
homer and extra Lisa because I don't
know what my son is going to want to do
they didn't make a Bart one so we'll see
what he wants to do he wants to be he
can be anybody he wants but it should be
a lot of fun next week for what the K so
make sure that you subscribe so you
don't miss it
mad love and I'll see you in a video
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
