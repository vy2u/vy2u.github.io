welcome back to what the K where we test
out Korean beauty products to decide
whether they're worth your time and
money today we're gonna be talking about
an exfoliating mask called the skin food
strawberry food therapy and this stuff
smells so good as you may have figured
out if you've watched many what the cave
I like things that smell like food and
this one smells like food it smells and
looks like strawberry jam it doesn't
smell exactly like strawberry jam I have
to say it does have a little bit of a
lotion and kind of scent along with it
but it smells more like real
strawberries than any other like makeup
product I have ever used
it was 9.14 cents on Amazon for the 3
point 5 3 ounce version you can also get
a 7 point 5 ounce for $14 you can also
get this on a website called I heard
that some of you have been talking about
in the comments below and you can also
buy this at Ulta but don't jump and buy
this all too yet cuz I've something to
tell you about that far as cruelty free
a lot of people have added asking me
about cruelty free status on the Korean
beauty product so there is a blog called
the clog dot CEO that says that all
products made in South Korea will be
cruelty free by 2018 so I thought that
was really interesting I don't know that
blogs I don't know I could find that
information anywhere else but I also
didn't look very hard so last night I
was really really really tired I had
stayed up really late on Saturday night
with a bunch of nine-year-olds sleeping
at my house for my daughter's birthday
party so I went to bed early last night
and now it's the morning Monday morning
and you're going to be seeing this on
Monday so you can see how long in real
time it takes me to edit one of these
things I didn't really spend a lot of
time looking for that information
elsewhere I found it kind of right
before I went to bed so any other
information I will put in the
description box that I find or if you
find anything that validates that that
would be awesome I'll put it in the
description box anyway so skin food is
on logical harmony which is a very
respected cruelty free blog they have it
on their pending list there's no
statement on skin Foods website as of
whether it is cruelty free or not the
only thing it's on their website is
as we believe in loving each other and
respecting the environment and world
around us but that is definitely not a
cruelty-free statement so I have no idea
to be honest with you if I find any
information if you find any information
about skin food then I will put it in
the description so let's go ahead and
talk about the claims of the product so
this is off the Amazon listing that is
by skin food so I was actually surprised
they didn't put more of the ingredients
in the description because the
ingredients are actually really good
especially compared to some of the other
Korean beauty products that I've been
trying lately so number one ingredient
is the Catholic capric triglyceride
which is a skin balancing ingredient
it's made from coconut oil and glycerin
both are very nice ingredients for the
skin and that's the number one
ingredient in this it's really really
nice the sucrose I will put some links
down below as far as the benefits of
that all I could find was a Huffington
Post article so far as the validity on
that one the article cites three reasons
sucrose is good for the skin number one
it says the draws moisture from the
environment into the skin number three
was an exfoliating thing which this
definitely is going to exfoliate and
then the second one I just I couldn't
understand it last night it was it
wasn't too sick but it was like making
my eye gloss over so you can reset
people up tip number three is actual
glycerin which is a skin balancing
ingredient the next one is the cleansing
ingredient than as a texture ingredient
and then there's acetyl at the Hexen 8
which is skin condition conditioning
ingredients and a texture ingredient
then we've got shea butter and then we
start getting into things that you may
or may not like so the next one is
lanolin which is made from the sebum of
sheep so it's like the oils that come up
out of the sheep and they get those
often that is what is in this product
the bite Beauty agave lip mask that's
one of the number one ingredients in
there also in the what's your name
Nicole Guerrero in the Nicole Guerrero
lip mask is one of the main ingredients
if you have ever been a nursing mom
you've probably heard of lansinoh I
think the only ingredient in that is the
lanolin it's good for severely damaged
cracked lips and
or nipples from nursing so I really
enjoy lanolin as an ingredient I use it
on my lips I love good bite Beauty agave
lip mask I also have a review coming up
eventually of the nicole arrow skincare
line but I'm doing the ordinary first
once I'm done with a review of the
ordinary I'll go into medical gross
stuff but I do really like the lip map
I'll tell you more about that when I get
there but anyway shillelagh I really
like as an ingredient of course vegans
are not going to like it because it is
an animal product and it may creep you
out so if it does you don't want this
some other ingredients in here we have a
macadamia seed oil so anyone with a nut
allergy is going to be out or tree nut
allergy is going to be out Mehta foam
seed oil strawberry seed strawberry seed
oil water to allergen concerns BHT and
fennel tea ethanol those are pretty
common in skincare so if you already
know that you're allergic to those just
so you know those are in here but if you
haven't been allergic in the past you're
probably okay and then some colorants
and things like that I noticed this was
really weird they I heard ingredients
and the Amazon ingredients were exactly
the same but the Olsen ingredients were
different they actually included less of
some of these ingredients I will put the
comparison of the two list next to each
other so that you can see which
ingredients they each have and honestly
I feel like that if you're going to buy
this you definitely want to go either
iHerb or Amazon it seems like they have
cut out some of the expensive
ingredients for the Ulta bergeon I guess
to make more profit that's what I would
imagine this is all speculation but but
I wouldn't buy it at Ulta even though
the Ulta one still has some great
ingredients in it you're going to get
more bang for your buck if you buy it
from Amazon or I her or I or however you
want to say I her by herb I of I herb
whatever you say in Britain I'm sure if
I herb so that is it for the ingredients
let's go ahead and put this on my face I
haven't used it yet so this is going to
be a first impression review put all in
my ears
mmm I got my hair did yesterday took a
little break from chillin with the fam
and got my hair done I feel like it
looks so much better instead of bringing
you into my bathroom I have a bowl here
of water and you're supposed to wet the
face I'm just going to take my washcloth
and give it in the wool top that feels
really good right now oh I can't do this
all day I always do a video of me just
wiping my face with the towel like that
would be amusing so now that my face is
damp we will but it's harder than I
expected it to be scrub a little bit of
that up and then we will rub it like
these and move can definitely feel we're
going to look like I'm bleeding
it feels very almost warming to the skin
it feels very oily all those oils in
here are very nice I'm going to scrub it
a little bit and then you're supposed to
leave it on for about 10 minutes to let
those oils seep is who it feels good the
grit is kind of a medium to larger grid
and it's not dissolving so some grits
will dissolve these sugar crystals for
strawberry seeds for whatever's the grit
in here is definitely not dissolving I
don't feel like I'm saturated in oils
but I can definitely feel a little bit
of oiliness on my skin it looks a lot
Wiggly ER right now then it feels so I'm
going to go ahead and take a 10-minute
break and go check on video comments on
YouTube and I'll be back in ten minutes
to wash this off and tell you how a my
skin feels alright we are back okay I
decided instead of answering YouTube
comments I ended up watching Ishaan he's
a total makeup junkie 101 I ended up
watching her anti haul video part of it
so yeah that's what I ended up doing the
last seven eight minutes so how's this
feel and this is still feeling quite
oily on my face I do want to zoom in so
you can see these sugar crystals and the
strawberry seeds okay can you see the
sugar crystals should we get even closer
let's get a little closer okay that's
really close but you can see how will
you leave my skin
you can see the sugar crystals and like
right yeah right there there's a little
strawberry seed there for me that way
leanness is a little bit uncomfortable
but it's not unbearable so let's go
ahead and wash this all I'm just going
to get my towel in it and see all the
sugar crystals coming off it smells
really perfect so smells amazing
alright dry towel I'm actually going to
step away from the camera for about five
minutes because I want to see how my
face feels in five minutes sometimes I
feel like it takes a little while for my
skin to kind of go back to normal after
I use a skin care product so give you
about five minutes and I'll be back with
my final thoughts so now it's been five
minutes since I took off the scrub and
I'll have to tell you I'm a little
surprised that my face feels a tad bit
dry I guess it's the cleansing products
that are in there that make my face feel
a little dry I mean my face feels very
soft but I don't feel like it's as
hydrated as I feel like it should have
been based on the ingredients I'm not
saying I don't like it I think I'm
definitely going to keep using it but
that kind of disappoints me a little bit
that I don't feel my face doesn't feel
especially hydrated because I'm sitting
there thinking as I had the mask on the
cloud is going to be so good for people
to dry skin this is a five heart rating
product it's amazing but now the way
that my skin feels is kind of telling me
a different story that doesn't mean that
my face isn't more hydrated than it was
before I put it on it's probably
stripped some of the dirt and yucky oils
off their skin balancing ingredients in
here so maybe I am more balanced then I
feel right now but feeling wise I don't
feel particularly balanced but I'm
trusting in the ingredients that my skin
is even though I don't feel it is that a
logical argument I was so gung ho for
this until I took it off and now I'm
like I don't know I'm not really sure
it's definitely one of my favorite face
scrubs that I've ever used I'm
really stuck between a five and a four
on this for the heart scale maybe I'll
figure out a way to do a four and a half
shot one of my hearts in half because I
really do like this a lot I don't think
that I can give it a five but I don't
think I can give it a four either
because I really enjoy it the
ingredients are so good this is
definitely my favorite four ingredients
since I reviewed the BB cream that was a
cotton candy BB cream that stuff had
really good ingredients in it as does
this I've been really disappointed in a
lot of the ingredients of the Korean
skincare that I've been reviewing and
the BB creams and things like that just
because they seem so low down but
they're so high up in this so I guess
I'm counting on science and their
research and what they say about the
ingredients in here to bump up the
rating on this but if it has to be just
based on feeling it would go down 204 so
yes that's why it is where it is and you
can kind of decide whether this is going
to be good for you or not if you
typically have scrubs that dry out your
face really bad this definitely doesn't
have a really bad drying feeling it's
just slightly dry feeling I am going to
go in with the rest of my morning
skincare routine and I will feel
perfectly hydrated and wonderful I was
just hoping this would do it on its own
I don't know I guess I had unrealistic
expectations of it but you know all
those beautiful oils and things I just
was hoping but that's okay it's alright
I still really really really really
really like it a lot only thank you so
much for watching this video if you
enjoyed what the K this week definitely
make sure you hit the subscribe button
so that you don't miss what the K next
week next week we will be working with
some clay masks I have a few of these
these are modeling clay face mask
there's one with green tea there's one
for oily skin one with collagen vitamin
one a cool one a charcoal one I haven't
decided which one I want to do so if you
have a vote of which one you want me to
try I probably won't do the oily skin
one just because I don't have
particularly oily skin but any of the
other ones if you have a preference of
which one you want me to try I'll just
go by vote so whichever one you want
definitely vote for it in the comments
below and whichever we'll get some most
votes that's the one I'll try next week
