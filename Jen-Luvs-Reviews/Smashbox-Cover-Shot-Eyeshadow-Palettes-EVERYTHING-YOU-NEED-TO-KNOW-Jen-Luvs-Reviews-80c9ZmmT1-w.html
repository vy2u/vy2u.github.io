little kit and play over here with this
thing my full review of two of the new
Smashbox cover shot palettes as you may
know I do extremely thorough reviews if
you are not aware of this please know
that there are skip ahead buttons down
below so you can get exactly where you
want to go to see exactly what you want
to see first thing you need to know is
that these are by Smashbox and they are
in collaboration with Shayne Mitchell
who is one of the actresses that was on
Pretty Little Liars
I am a big Pretty Little Liars fan I am
a big Shay Mitchell fan she does have a
youtube channel I will link her YouTube
channel down below there are quite a few
palettes in the line I believe there are
seven altogether I only bought two I
their $29 piece and I did not want to
spend more than $60 for this review let
me just be honest with you
$60 was enough for me some details about
these that you need to know they are
made in Italy they are leaping bunny
certified cruelty free but some people
may not care that it's leaping bunny
certified because this brand Smashbox in
2010 was acquired by Estee Lauder which
is not a cruelty-free company so even
though these pallets were not tested on
animals according to Smashbox the money
eventually trickles up to Estee Lauder
making to some people these not cruelty
free these are not vegan there are there
is Carmine in every single one of these
eyeshadow formulas so no they are not
vegan they're available at Smashbox com
ulta.com sephora.com I do believe they
are available in Sephora and Ulta stores
but I have not seen them personally but
I do believe they are there as well this
is the smoky eye palette as a frame of
reference this is the Urban Decay Naked
basics - it's actually taller and than
this as far as grams of product you do
get about the same amount of product as
you get in a Naked basics palette let me
show you
the Too Faced chocolate bar palette in
case you own this you can see the size
difference and then against the original
Urban Decay Naked 2 so it is a mini
palette
the cover is holographic if you've ever
had a holographic sticker where it
changes that same and it is a little bit
weird if you have this sitting somewhere
you can accidentally do a double-take on
it like whoa did something just move
over out of the corner of my eye so it
is really really cool how they split put
that extra love into the packaging and
the top of the package does nest inside
the bottom of the package and you kind
of have to stick your fingernail or your
finger in here to pull this up it is a
magnetic closure the mirror does go
almost all the way to the edges almost
not quite and then it nests inside here
according to a Sephora where I read this
as how to use this product you're
supposed to lay down one of these shades
first and then apply the other products
so that's what I did today for this look
the demo is coming in a little while you
skip ahead again down below so for price
program I'm going to read off of my
notes here we have seven point six five
grams of product in here it is a $29
eyeshadow palette which leads to three
dollars and 79 cents per gram not quite
as bad as the to the Too Faced chocolate
chip palettes the white chocolate chip
in the regular chocolate chip those are
$4 per gram of product so it's a little
bit better than that but not by much I
did decide to compare this to other
Smashbox palettes so compared to the
full exposure palette that one is three
dollars and seventy one cents program
and that is a full sized palette so it's
basically the same price per gram as
that the full exposure travel palette is
actually quite expensive at four dollars
and 28 cents per gram that's very
expensive per gram and the matte
exposure palette is actually the best
value of all of these at three dollars
and nine cents per gram when you're
looking at a good deal a good value of
price per gram for a Sephora brand
prestige brand product you're looking at
anywhere between two to three dollars
once you hit that three dollar mark
you're starting to go into more
expensive territory for example the
naked palettes are just over three
dollars per gram so this is more expense
per gram then the naked palettes so keep
that in mind if you are somebody that
does hit pan on your eyeshadow palettes
that this isn't the best deal also keep
in mind that the full-size Smashbox
palettes do come with a brush and this
does not so you're getting that
additional brush with those full-size
products and that's not factored into
the price per gram I did not mention
which ones of these I have I have two of
them I have this smokey eye palette and
then I have the Golden Hour palette at
the smoky eye palette of course is for
smoky eyes and the Golden Hour palette
is almost like a it's very pinks and
purples and browns it's a speaking of
that I know you're excited to see
swatches so let's go ahead and get into
the swatches right now okay this is the
golden hour eye palette and for the
first watches I'm going to swatch dope
lights hot line and turned on so when we
look at dope and lights those are those
first two I really feel like they don't
swatch as well on the arm as they did as
far as application on the eyes you
really can't see them in the swatches
remember I don't have any primer on my
arm I don't have any foundation on my
arms so you definitely want to use a
base with these two colors in particular
also keep in mind my individual skin
tone they are very close to my natural
skin tone so they're going to show up
differently on people of different skin
tones now I do feel like with hot line
which is being swiped right now and
turned on which is the next one I do
feel like those are showing up the way
they show up on the eye when we look at
this row we're looking at very very
natural looking colors except for that
pink when you apply the hot line and
turned on on the eyes they are very much
like the swatches in that they don't
have a ton of shimmer in them they are a
very mild shimmer so if you have aging
lids then this may be a good shimmer for
you to work with I did something
different this time I wanted to show you
when I took my washcloth and wiped off
the shadow I wanted to show you how they
fade this is kind of what will happen if
you over blend the shadows you'll see
that some of them stain and then some of
them kind of wipe away so this is also a
good indication
lasting power of whether these are going
to fade more through the day and as you
see some of the swatches hang around
longer than others let's go ahead and
swatch that second quad so now we're
gonna be looking at hero psyched rock
stars and stair hero I do feel like is a
bit powdery that's that first cream
shade I do feel like again this one does
apply better to the eyes over primer
than it does on the arm you can see the
swatch for psyched that one you see how
the finger swatch is just so much better
than the brush swatch and you really
really really want to think about
applying some of these with your
fingertip rather than a brush I do feel
like Rockstar is gonna apply better with
the finger or with a sponge applicator
than with a brush then when we get into
stair you'll notice the first swatch is
really really weak so I decided to dig
into that one a second time just because
I didn't feel like it was showing an
accurate representation so you can
really see how these are going to apply
to the eye I feel like on this except
for with hero that lightest shade I do
feel like it does apply a bit better to
the eye now seeing that wipe test and
you see that the swatch is really do
hang around awhile for this quad there
is definitely some staining there when I
say staining I'm not trying to say like
staining like the staining of a shirt
when you spill grape juice on it it's
more of you know this a shadow is gonna
hang around a little bit longer on your
eye than one that will wipe away easily
now getting into the smoky eye palette
this is the palette really why I wanna
do the wipe test you'll see that in a
minute let's talk about this first quad
feature headline hell yeah and rock me
this say shade feature is a beautiful
crease color from my skin tone it would
be a beautiful lid all over lid shade
for someone of a medium skin tone this
one swatches beautifully with a brush
this one is definitely my favorite
shadow of all of the shadows in either
of these palettes when you go into
headline you can see what the brush
swatch you can see that black undertone
of a headline where you don't see in the
brush swatch that read as much as you
see it in a finger swatch and you'll see
that when I apply it on the eyes and the
demo as well going on to hell yeah you
can also see that it's got a little bit
of a black base
to it but it's not quite as bad as the
as headline it's not as true of a gold
as I wish that it was now the silver
which is called rock me this one it's
okay for me it's it's just all right I
wish that it was a little more poppy of
a silver rather than having that black
bass and you can really see when I turn
my arm that black in the backgrounds
where you're gonna get that depth that
smokiness but the dominating color that
seems to be in the pan isn't as
prominent as it is when you do the
finger swatch so again consider using a
fingertip or a sponge tip applicator
with those and when you wipe you can
really see that hell yeah and rock may
really turn into the same color as they
begin to fade away which is kind of a
muddy tannish black also the brightness
of the red shade also faded to like a
deep burgundy let's move on to the
second quad instinct STFU Slayer and big
night I also really like instinct I feel
like the matte shades in the squad are
definitely stronger in use in
pigmentation and not being patchy not
being powdery then in the golden hour
palette you can even see it in the brush
swatches that they just seemed to be of
a better formula than the other ones I
find this green has a very similar
problem to the red in that it does have
that black base to it so the green can
easily fade away if you're not careful
and you end up over blending Slayer is
that matte gray it's also a beautiful
shade it kind of reminds me a little bit
of feature as far as the quality I
really like that one a lot and with big
night this one has some blue sparkles in
it but the blue sparkles definitely are
more prominent when you use a fingertip
rather than a brush when you use a brush
the blue sparkles tend to fade away
quite a bit and you can see that in the
arm swatch altogether I again I really
think that the best quality shadows in
here are feature which is the first one
and Slayer which is that matte gray but
even the matte gray
be a little bit patchy and the white
test on this one I thought was very
interesting in that you can see they all
fade away to that gray same gray tone
you can almost barely even tell the
difference between the shadows once you
start wiping them away again this is a
clean towel there's no makeup remover on
it but the green is completely gone and
you're just down to this muddy brown
gray do them a little bit differently
this time definitely hit the survey up
in the corner I have a poll of whether
you like the talk-through swatch is
better or if you like just the music I
would love to know your feedback on that
trying something a little different here
at the request of my friend Maureen
who's been part of the community for a
really long time so now we're gonna go
into the demo of me getting this look
and let me tell you kind of where I was
going with it I wanted to show you how
both of these toilets work so what I
decided to do was start off with the
gold and our palette do a complete look
with mostly the golden our palette I did
have to use a transition from the smoky
palette because there is no transition
shade in here for me but I do a complete
look with basically the Golden Hour
palette and then I cover it up
with the smoky palette kind of a day to
night kind of idea so I'm gonna shut up
now and let's go ahead and get it right
into the demo of the gun never seen it
so easy I've got a river for a soul and
baby you're a boat baby
there would be nothing else a guy who
can never beat you will never see this
it's all my life you stood by me when no
one else was ever behind me all these
lights they can't blind me with your
love
my life
when no one else was ever behind man
these lights
nobody can drag me down nobody nobody
nobody can drag me
nobody can
baby baby
you can drag me down
my life stood by me when no one else was
ever behind me all these lights they
can't blind me with your love nobody can
drag me
whatever behind me
all right now you've seen how these a go
on to the eye let's go ahead and jump
into ingredient analysis this is when I
go to ewg org and so my other favorite
ingredient analysis websites places that
talk about ingredients in cosmetics and
kind of tell you whether they're really
truly bad or not AWG has the scale where
they rate cosmetics between a 1 and a 10
1 being the least amount of harm to 10
being the most amount of harm and I
don't have anything in this palette
that's more than a 4 so overall this is
a pretty clean palette let me talk to
about what is in here number one
ingredient that may bother you is talc
talc is in most I shadow palettes and a
lot of shadow palettes has been in every
single palette but I've done an
ingredient analysis on it is rated at 3
on Environmental Working Group it is an
irritant for some people some people are
very sensitive to tell studies by the
national toxicology panel demonstrated
that cosmetic grade talc free of
asbestos which is what this is is a form
of magnesium silicate that can also be
toxic and carcinogenic there are some
people that are really pushing for more
more research on talc so we'll keep you
posted if those let that legislation
goes through if you've never been
sensitive to a product whitout before
you may want to ignore the talc warning
but they're just so you know there is a
lot we don't know about health I will
leave links for more information down in
the description below and feel free to
share your knowledge about talk if you'd
like down in the comments the next one
is a common one if you see my ingredient
alysus before another one phenoxyethanol
it is only in the smokey eyes palette it
is not in the golden our palette it's
rated a for for Environment
Environmental Working Group it is a
preservative it's a replacement for
parabens a lot of people are sensitive
to parabens so a lot of companies have
replaced parabens with phenoxyethanol
and that is in a ton of eyeshadow
palettes there are high concerns
recognized by the European Union the
first one is that is classified as an
irritant there are people that are
sensitive to this and their eyes can be
irritated by it
there is also an allowed workplace
exposure restriction
in the European Union other moderate
concerns include organ system toxicity
there are non reproductive and some low
concerns our data gaps meaning that they
just don't know a lot about this
ingredient it is classified as toxic or
harmful for only products used on the
lips by the European Union of course
we're just talking about the smokey
palette right now but I do have some
other ingredients I'm about to mention
that are in this do not put these
products on your lips there's quite a
few ingredients that say not for the
lips
we have chromium hydroxide greens which
is a persistence and bioaccumulation
issue meaning that it can build up in
your system again the warning is only
for on the lips by the FDA the next one
is ferric ferrocyanide same thing one to
four on the on the scale and the other
name for it is Prussian blue there are
some moderate concerns for organ system
toxicity and non-reproductive and again
only four products on the lips by the
fda ultramarines again one to four it is
a violation of government restrictions
if you use too much of this in a product
i would imagine with an eye shadow that
wouldn't be too much but you know they
have to abide by that by the fda again
only four products on the lips and
finally there's something called yellow
5 lake which is a non soluble pigment
it's all the other name for it is tart
Zenit artisan other high concerns are
for persistence and bioaccumulation so
building up in your system and Oregon
system toxicity so you know that one
doesn't say specifically for on the lips
so just be aware of that but again it's
only it's a pigment there's very little
bit in there but I did want to let you
know just to reinforce do not put any of
these shadows on your lips I think I've
said that a million times how many times
have I said it like eight at this point
so now let's get into my full review of
these pellets let's start with the one
that I started with let's start with the
golden hour palette okay I realized that
only eight shadows you're only gonna
have so much option for color variety
I do wish that they had done something a
little different in tone between one two
three and four these are all kind of mid
tone shades then really the only deeper
shade here is this purple so I wish that
they had done something one more shade a
little bit deeper instead of doing for
mid-tone shade so you've got a nice brow
bone highlights and for me this is an
all-over lid color this may be a
highlight for some people you're very
fair this may be a crease transition
color for you as far as the way these
things go together I'm honestly like I
don't think that you can get a ton of
looks out of this I really don't I mean
you're really looking at what I showed
you in the demo the only way to give
this palette any kind of variation is to
use this purple or not use the purple
eye you can go with more of a goldish
kind of look or you can go with a more
pinkish kind of look but there's no real
way to deepen it other than to get that
purple if you're one of those
one-and-done people where you really
like just one lid shade and a transition
and you like these neutral shades maybe
you want a lighter lid for work I do
feel like this is mostly suited to
medium skin tones and lighter I don't
feel like there's a lot of variation for
deep skin tones in here and honestly I
don't feel like there's a lot of
variation for anybody in here the shades
tend to money together because they are
of the same medium ish kind of tone when
I see a palette I really want to see
some light some middle and some deep
tones and I just feel like this really
sticks in those middle tones a little
too much for me as far as being able to
vary the look they're they're all kind
of from the same color family and I also
don't feel like this color selection is
very unique now I do want to show you
the tardis Pro next to this and the
reason why I'm showing you this is
because I feel like you can get similar
looks even though this is primarily a
matte palette where this is primarily a
shimmer palette if you look here I mean
it's kind of the same family you know
you've got your pinks and your purples I
mean this shade right here is very
similar to this shade
right here I'm they're not the same
they're not Dukes but they're similar
this shade up here is kind of similar to
this shade over here so I mean I don't I
don't feel like if you own the tardis
Pro I don't feel like you really need
this unless you really are dying over
that over the shimmery purple I know
it's not a unique color selection it's a
very pretty color selection but it's not
unique what I did was I went on the
Sephora website and I sorted it by
pallets I did the same thing on the Ulta
website there's some other palettes that
I don't own then I saw on the web sites
that were similar to this like the CIA
London Cloe Morello beauty home was
similar the Clinique a very honey
holiday eye palette the L'Oreal color
isla palette nude - you might be able to
pull some of that out of there the Tarte
the brand new Tarte man-eater eyeshadow
palette is also kind of similar to this
as far as lasting power on this palette
I found it to last through an entire
maybe six to seven hours before it
starts to fade so if you're going
through our typical school or work day
it will last you most of your day
without it significantly fading but
don't try to take this into the night
because you're it's not gonna look good
by the end of the night at least on my
eyes I've use it with multiple primers I
do find that it does work best with the
Smashbox eyeshadow primer it is Adam
ethic home based eyeshadow primer so
maybe that's it it doesn't work nearly
as well with let's say the Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer potion so who is this
palette good for I feel like this
palette is good for someone that wants a
very simple very you know natural
looking eye look and if that's your
thing I think you'll really really like
this palette I like it suddenly for
people didn't like shimmer because there
really isn't a whole lot of matte to do
in here you have to enjoy shimmer which
means if you have lids that have texture
on them you may not enjoy this so much
but I do want let you know that the
shimmer is not very intense in these
it's a very mild shimmer so even if you
have texture on your lids you may still
enjoy this because it's not that really
poppy foiled kind of shimmer it's
there's no glitter in it at all and it
doesn't really accentuate any fine lines
have but I'm only 38 so I don't know if
it may accentuate it more for you but
you know if you do want to try some
shimmer this may be okay for you because
like I said that shimmer is not super
intense
I do recommend this again for people
medium skin tone and lighter I think
this would be great for a teenager or a
younger person who just wants a very
natural looking eye look I think this
would be fun there are people that this
will work for but personally I don't
really think that it's anything special
in my collection I have kind of a stupid
amount of hot shadow though so don't go
by me it doesn't do anything to make me
go wow that's so cool palette you know
what I'm saying let's go ahead and move
on to the smoke it you got stuff falling
everywhere let's go ahead and move on to
the smoky palette now this is kind of
the opposite the other one I wanted to
get to balance they were very different
and I sure did that this one right here
I try to do the same thing and try to
look up on sephora.com and ulta.com and
try to find any kind of pallets that
look like this girlfriend or boyfriend I
could not find anything except for one
the only palette I found that had
similar shades to this was the NYX
wicked dreams eyeshadow palette which of
course has a lot more shades than this
one I'm not saying it's dupes in any way
I don't own it I'm just looking at a
picture online but you do have the green
you have a burgundy you have the gray
you have deep Browns you have these kind
of matte shades you have a black this
black has some blue glitter in it I
don't think that one does but if you
want a similar look you could probably
get that palette and get away with it so
we've got this nice brow bone shade and
for me this is a really nice transition
shade this would be a great lid color
for someone with deeper skin tone you
know how that was saying earlier about
how Smashbox wanted these to be kind of
your all-over lid color before you start
your look there you go deep skin ladies
this one's for you for that they thought
of you I think this palette was made for
you for me and my light to medium skin
tone I had a heck of a time using this
palette and trying to get looks it
didn't make me look like I got punched
in the eye
I ain't so much this ballot and maybe
it's just me maybe I'm just not skilled
enough I don't know but I looked at the
picture of shave from there from there
ad you know che did a different look
with each pallet I'm gonna show you this
one is her golden hour look and you can
see kind of it's very flat you know it's
that pink look and if you look at her
smoky palette look it's black it's black
that's it shouldn't even have any colors
on it and there's a reason why it's
because a lot of if you blend too much
with these they just turn black so what
I have found and this is a trick for
this palette if you decide to buy it is
use a sponge tip applicator or your
finger to apply the red and the green
and you will be able to maintain that
color but if you use a fluffy brush to
blend don't expect that color to hang
around it's gonna be gone so the same
thing with the gold and the silver
especially the gold maybe a little less
with the silver but they just fade out
to black it is a very difficult tell it
to work with at least for me if you have
a lot of talent maybe you're great at it
but today was the best I ever got this
thing to perform of you like the other
one had all mid-tone shades this one has
all deep shades whether it looks like it
or not when you pat them on the lid they
all turned deep except for of course
these two up here so you're still not
going to get that variation in tone that
I think is really really important in
palettes in order to get a wonderful
varied you know just really poppy lots
of color separation kind of look they
all kind of blend together and I think
that's why on Shea they just gave her a
black look and maybe I'm googling the
wrong thing but I just can't find any
looks that someone is pulled off to
accurately keep the color it's just I
don't know I don't like this one either
I hate to say it and I know that there
are some people that are giving these
rave reviews people that I love and
respect but I didn't I honestly I don't
like either of them this one's too
ordinary
this one's too difficult to work with I
don't know about the other ones I
a blaze is very very popular some people
in the community are saying that it's
powdery and it doesn't last some people
are saying they love it that's really
the only other one I've heard anything
about I will link smash box's website
and Sephora and Ulta if you want to
check out all the pellets I can only
speak to these two and honestly I'm not
a fan of either one sorry sorry smash
