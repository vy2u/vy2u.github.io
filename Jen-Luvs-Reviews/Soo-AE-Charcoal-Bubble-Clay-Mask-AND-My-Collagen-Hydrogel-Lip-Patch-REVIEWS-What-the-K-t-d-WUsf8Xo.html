where we checked out Korean beauty
products to decide whether they're worth
your time and money today we are doing
double duty with two products from soo a
we've got the charcoal clay bubble mask
we're going to try another bubble mask
to see if I like it better and the my
collagen hydrogel whip pack so if you're
curious about these I've got some
information for you coming up right
about now lovely folks over xqa were
kind enough to give these to me at
generation Beauty with no obligation to
review they just kind of hand me the bag
when I said that I made youtube videos
and we're going to go ahead and try two
of them and see whether they are worth
it or not when we're just going to do
the bubble claim app then after some
research I was like I think we might
need a second product on this one but
let me tell you why so let's just start
with the information about this bubble
claim app you see it is kind of a
smaller pack it isn't a sheet mask it is
like a cream kind of mask that comes in
a pouch this is what they say about it
they say packed with charcoal powder
this quirky carbonated mask cleanses
exfoliates and unclogs pores it bubbles
as it swaps off dead skin cells and
lifts pore clogging dirt and sebum if
powerful nutrients also replenish the
skin softening and smoothing smoothing
for a youthful glow you can get these
right now it says on sale I don't know
if that's like a permanent sale or not
on the sue a website for three dollars
and fifty cents but you can also get
them at Walmart calm for two dollars and
fifty cents I did look on the target
website and on the Ulta website and did
not see these even though they do sell
sue a product I don't think they sell
this particular product at those those
retailers the first thing you need to
know about the ingredients with this is
that a lot of them are coconut derived
ingredients so if you have any issues
with coconut then you definitely want to
stay away from this product when looking
at the ingredients for this I was
getting sadder and sadder
looked at it because it look like you
know when a brand gives me something
especially like they're giving it to me
for free like I want to love it and I
want to say great things about it but
sometimes that just doesn't happen so
this is going to be one of those with
the ingredients it's got 22 total
ingredients the first ingredient is
water
kaylynn is the second ingredient it's
supposed to be like an acne oil oily
skin kind of helper it's supposed to
also tighten the skin it can also be an
exfoliant there was some mixed
information about whether Kalyn was okay
for sensitive skin or not some people
said yes so people said no so just so
you know the third ingredient is
something called Coppa middle propyl
Beth pain and it's a surfactant so it's
helping us to wash away the dirt and the
oil and all of that from our skin there
is also mixed information about
allergies and irritation there the next
one number four is very similar in
function and all of that to the number
three ingredient except for that there
was less evidence of irritation and
allergy in that one next ingredient is a
stabilizer and then a solvent to send
the formula then sodium laureth sulfate
which is also a surfactant that we just
talked about a minute ago there are some
irritation concerns but not as many
irritation concerns as sodium lauryl
sulfate you may have heard of like
sulfate free shampoos and things like
that it's the same kind of sulfates that
are in here finally we get to a skincare
ingredient at number 8 which is glycerin
it's a skin replenishing ingredient that
I really like to see in skincare but
it's all the weight number 8 and it's
the first ingredient that actually looks
like it's going to be very helpful for
the skin except for maybe the kaylynn
but I don't know I'm not super convinced
about Kon being a great skincare
ingredient and maybe a good one but it's
not one that makes me go wow then we
have another texture ingredient a surfer
can't an inorganic salt that is for
oxidizing on moisture binding
ingredients and then something called
bentonite and bentonite is supposed to
absorb oil and impurities there's a
website I really like called truth and
aging this is what they have to say
about it it says many plumping creams
use benzoate because it transports
moisture from the lower layers of the
skin to the surface in real
those so-called anti-aging creams do
more harm than good by dehydrating the
deeper levers levels of the epidermis
damaging the cell and all for
superficial plumping so it brings the
moisture from the deep layers up to the
top but then dehydrates the deep layers
because it kind of sucks it all up so it
makes your face look good for a while
but then it kind of you know it's
messing up down below so you know you
may see something good in the beginning
but then not so good later but that's
just one source so I don't ever go a
hundred percent based on one source and
there's a foam boosting ingredient and
then we get to the charcoal powder at
number fifteen charcoal powder is known
to pull out dirt and oils and toxins and
things like that then some gum now we're
getting down to kind of the miniscule
amounts in this product these are the
ingredients that I wish were higher up
all in toe it is a really good
ingredient that I like to see in
skincare but it's number 17 it
stimulates cell regrowth it's supposed
to be really good for acne scarring and
things like that
another servic and another preservative
that number 20 we get to teach you a
tree extract number 21
among the bean extract which there's a
lot of research for internal ingestion
but there isn't a lot for skin and then
apple extract so really not very
impressed with this and at this point
basically ingredients I would say if you
have sensitive skin you definitely want
a patch test this if you have dry skin
based on the ingredients from my
perspective I would not try this if you
have dry skin if you have oily skin or
acne prone skin this is probably
something that's more targeted toward
you not a lot of good anti-aging
ingredients in here today just seems
like a glorified cleanser based on the
ingredients and I'm not a cosmetic
chemist but I do a lot of researching
their own ingredients and I'm just not
impressed with this one but even after
all of that we're still going to try it
because maybe it'll make my skin feel
magical of course this is just a first
impression so long time you submit to be
able to talk about but you know maybe
it'll be good who knows the other one
that we're going to do is this one this
is the collagen hydrogel lip patch and
just quickly about this one same thing
it's 350 @ üa on on sale and what that
feels like a real sale or not and 250 at
walmart.com this is a three-game
with treatment so we're just going to do
day one today and then we are going to
bring this final thoughts on this into
my next week's review this one actually
has some really good ingredients in it
glycerin is the second ingredient under
water and then something called knotted
rack which is an algae extract is number
three of skin conditioning soothing
boost circulation and then willow herb
extract which is skin conditioning
soothing antioxidant and then purslane
which is skin soothing and antioxidant
so those are the first five ingredients
so this is much more impressive as far
as the ingredients goes and these fruit
extract like the little star dried
little star things you can get at the
grocery store it's got some mixed things
going on here skin conditioning
antioxidant but people are saying that
the fragrance in it could be a skin
sensitizer so if you have an allergic
reaction to this then that's probably
what it is there's also something that
says that it could increase your photo
sensitivity which is not good at all
skullcap extract is another really good
one it's an antioxidant it protects
against sun damage and its skin
conditioning and then we get into kind
of the non ingredients the ones that are
just way way way down lots of fruit
extracts hydrolyzed collagen sodium high
alert are way down at 21 and 22 and then
we have fragrance at 25 and 27 is acid
red 18 which is common commonly used in
hair dye it looked really shady and
terrible at first that it was
cancer-causing but that was only when it
was ingested by rats I couldn't find any
human studies and I couldn't find any
topical studies that said that this was
bad so I don't know how much of the red
dye they were feeding to these rats that
made them turn pink I mean it just makes
me nauseous just thinking about it but
but yeah so this I'm not worried about
the acid red 18 at this point based on
what I've learned so far about it so
enough jibba jabba let's get into using
this charcoal clay bubble map it says on
the directions before opening the pouch
press down with the palms in a sweeping
motion from top to bottom at
thoroughly cleansing the skin oh let me
go cleanse my skin hold on a subject I'm
going to go thoroughly cleanse my skin I
will be right back all right I
thoroughly cleanse my skin with my
Keywest
aloe gentle facial cleanser due to the
intense amount of cleansers in this
product I wanted to do something a
little bit more gentle this is a
fantastic face cleanser by the way this
was sent to me by Key West aloe a very
long time ago something like that's
beside the point so I'm going to rub
this right here by an adequate amount
evenly on dry or damp face carefully
avoiding eyes and mouth when oxygen and
bubbles form wet fingertips and massage
gently and upward and outward circular
motions starting from the center of the
face so we're going to go like this go
to practice first make sure I do it
right
upward and outwards this will be this
way upward well what about the chin is
an upward or outward I guess we'll go
outward go like this okay I had to
practice and they are supposed to rinse
off with water and follow regular skin
care I've got my towel so I don't make
big mess let's go ahead and open this up
and try it out oh come on
or okay there we go
oh it's not opening maybe I should get
some scissors because a little rip II
don't you hate it when the little rippy
thing doesn't really make it open okay
let's try scissors it smells like a pool
exactly what it smells like like right
when you walk into an indoor pool that's
exactly what it smells like
there's about I'll squeeze it all the
way up to the top about this much
product in here so it's not a lot of
product it's definitely a one-time-use
thing I'm going to squeeze it all out
onto my hands now I did use a bubble
clay mask before and I did not like the
feeling of it so I was hoping that I
would like this one more
okay we feel pretty good right now this
feels pretty awesome right now I'm very
happy with them no rinse my fingers a
little bit give it some time whoa there
it goes it doesn't feel bad at all
though like the one the Eliza Becca one
was very tingly like it felt like little
teeny tiny ants were crawling all over
my face
this one feels good it really doesn't
feel bad at all compared to the Eliza
Becca this is nothing but I will say
that the Eliza Becca one was definitely
had better ingredients than this one
when oxygen bubbles form wet fingertips
and massage gently upward and outward in
a circular motion listen this can you
hear that sounds amazing I wish that
this had better ingredients because I'm
actually enjoying myself very much
upward outward circular motions this is
not feel uncomfortable it feels very
smooth it feels very nice I'm very much
enjoying this I feel like I'm at a spa
I'll just close my eyes and pretend
these hands belong to somebody else
don't get any weird ideas in your head
now now I put the lip mask on now but
this isn't supposed to sit on your face
and the lip mask is so I'm going to go
ahead and wash this off and then we're
going to try the lip mask at this point
I have washed off the mask followed it
up with my toner and then put on my face
wheel and that is my typical morning
skincare routine and I can tell you that
after I wash it off I did give it a few
minutes to see how my face would feel
and it definitely felt like I just
cleanse my face but it didn't feel
overly dry sometimes when I cleanse my
face with less expensive or bad
ingredient cleansers my face feels
completely stripped and horrible it
didn't feel horrible it definitely felt
kind of stripped but not as bad as some
other ones that I've used so you
oily skin or acne-prone skin this may be
something that you want to try even
though there aren't a lot of good skin
benefits to it it does seem to do a good
job of cleansing the skin and it's fun
so I did enjoy using this I wish that
there were better skin benefits in it
like a lot of Korean beauty but you know
it is what it is and the other thing is
the prices you're paying two dollars and
fifty cents for a one-time use which i
think is just kind of crazy I wish that
it came in a jar like the Eliza Becca I
feel like that would be something that I
could recommend a little bit easier even
if it was costing you know fifteen to
twenty dollars if you had a jar of it I
feel like I could you know I would say
yes but two dollars and fifty cents even
for one time you seems like a lot to me
personally I don't know I don't know
what your threshold is for expensive for
skin care let's go ahead and move on to
the lip map so with the lip mask it said
we are supposed to remove the hydrogel
lip patch from the package and apply to
clean lips leave on for 10 to 15 minutes
and then remove Pat remaining essence
with finger tips to improve absorption
there is only one lip gel in here I was
expecting to see three of them in there
that were just dinner but I guess not
they did give me free packs of them so I
guess I'm going to use all three packs
let's go ahead and try it out I'm going
to put this on my lips I won't be able
to talk to 15 minutes so I'll see you in
15 minutes
okay so it has been 15 minutes I just
took off my lip map and well first of
all it definitely has kind of a
chemically taste on my lips that I don't
enjoy I don't feel like it was able to
get right here which is my biggest
problem area with my lips it's right
here and I felt like I had to
continually like push it so it would go
where my driest spots are so that was
kind of annoying
this is definitely one time use there's
no way that I could be able to use this
again I feel like all the product has
absorbed into my skin my lips feel fine
I think that they're definitely I'm
definitely have to do more uses of this
to see if I see any difference I also
don't have a lot of fine lines around my
lips that may be a reason why this may
not work for me as well as someone else
that does but I do have really really
dry lips
so I was hoping to be able to get rid of
some of the dryness here I don't know
maybe it feels a little bit better I
don't know but it's funny because the
one with the worst ingredients I was
more impressed with some the one with
the better ingredients I'm kind of like
meh so I don't know I mean it's exactly
the opposite of what I thought I was
going to feel after trying these
products so you know it just goes to
show that ingredients aren't everything
as far as an experience with the product
but I will definitely try this for the
rest of the week I'll do two more
treatments and see how it goes and we'll
be back next week to see the final
thoughts on that I do have a little
surprise for you I did want to do a
little giveaway with some of these
products that suea gave me I was going
to give away another one of the lip map

have to keep all three in order to do
that but I am going to give away a
