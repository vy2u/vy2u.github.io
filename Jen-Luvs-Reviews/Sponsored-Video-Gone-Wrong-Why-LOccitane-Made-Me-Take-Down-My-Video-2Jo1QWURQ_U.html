was up for a couple days and then it was
gone
and I got a bunch of questions on my
social media what happened to the video
is the middle of watching it what
happened I can finally tell you what
happened to that video and we're gonna
get into it right now before we get
going just a little insight and how I'm
going to handle this video and the way I
want to handle it is just by telling you
a story and telling you what happened in
my relationship with love suit on and
you know where it all kind of went wrong
let me just go ahead and start off by
saying it the only product had ever
tried before I was offered to do a
sponsored video with l'occitane was
their hand cream and my daughter had
used it and she absolutely loved it my
daughter's 10 and she gets very very dry
hands in the winter and this hand cream
was wonderful for her there was one
winter we were using it I think she was
about seven and her hands were like they
were cracking and bleeding because they
were so dry and I had gotten I think a
sample in a subscription box or
something I gotten one somehow that I
didn't physically pay for and we tried
it and we were like oh my gosh so
immediately I went onto I think birch
boxes website at the time I can't
remember where I bought it I don't
remember but I immediately bought her
one because it was so amazing for her so
when LOX eat on well not lock see time
but a PR company that was working for
L'Occitane contacted me and asked me if
I wanted you a sponsor video for them I
was really excited I know that good
skincare is an investment and I think
that's why I wanted to do a good job
with this video and I wanted to find out
and really figure out whether these
products were truly worth the money that
they were advertising the PR company
contacted me and offered me a set dollar
amount along with commissions of sales
in return I would create two videos one
video for the immortelle line which I'll
put a photo of that line there that was
five products I believe one two three
four five yes five products and then one
for the almond line which I will show a
picture of that there the target date
range of when I was supposed to upload
that video was between February 15th and
March 20th and then for the almond range
it was supposed to be March 21st through
April 10th so now I'm going to show you
an email that this is very typical of
emails that I send out to brands when
they reach out from to me for a
sponsored video so you know if someone
accepts this then they're legit so here
we go this is what it says I'll put on
the screen now thank you for contacting
me regarding a review of locs eat on
products I would be happy to produce the
requested content because the deadline
is so close and I didn't know when I was
going to be getting the products I said
I will not be able to speak to the full
effects of the products however I will
be able to give my viewers a rundown of
ingredients as well as a first
impression of texture scent etc this
will be an honest video based on
research and initial impressions and
looking forward to learning what
L'Occitane has to offer and that was
accepted by the PR company they did send
me an agreement to sign a contract was
extremely simple and it was actually
signed by myself and the PR company
L'Occitane wasn't listed as someone to
sign so that adds into the story a
little bit later so it says that I will
agree to provide those two videos for
them and then they will pay me the
specific dollar amount also I was giving
rights to Locks Etan to use my video in
any way that they chose and also I had
to provide an FTC disclaimer that is all
that was on the contract that I signed
and that is very important that that is
all that was on the contract that I
signed the products arrived to me on
March 8th and in the time between March
8th and March 20th the video deadline I
needed to try the products research the
products film the video and edit the
video it wasn't a big turnaround time
and if you know anything about skincare
it does take a while to see results from
skincare the cleansers I would be able
to give you a little bit more of a
review because I could talk about how it
washed my makeup off how it made my skin
feel things like that the skincare I was
really just going off of texture and
scent like I had said in the original
email within the box they did give a
couple of cards that had information on
each ingredient just a basic blur
kind of like you would read on a Sephora
or an Ulta website about what the
product does after I received the box
I did get some additional clarifying
talking points for the video from the PR
company so one thing was there were
specific brands I was not allowed to
mention in the video that were
competitor brands I have no problem with
that it was an exclusive video
specifically for that product I had no
problem with that also I needed to make
sure I hash tagged when I shared added
the write a lock seat on account and
again they reiterated the FTC disclaimer
because that is really really important
another thing that they mentioned was
they didn't want me to mention the
almonds line in the first video so I
emailed them and I was like hey I kind
of want to use it as like a teaser for
the next video is that all right with
you if I just mentioned at the very end
they keep the PR company got back to me
and they said yes it's fine as long as
it's only a quick mention of it and that
there is another video about it no
problem so I'm thinking I'm good and
grand and good I spent so many hours
researching the ingredients for the
immortelle line there was so much that I
didn't recognize that I didn't know
including the immortelle flower which is
what the line is based on so I did all
this research I filmed I spent a lot of
time editing it I had pictures flying in
I had text flying up I had screenshots
of different things I had researched I
mean I put a lot into this video so much
into this video I was really proud of it
I knew that I had been true to myself I
had been honest in the video I'd given
you both the positives and some
negatives for the products like I always
do with every review that I do the
response to the video from people that
watched it was overall very positive
people really enjoyed the video except
for there were a couple of people that
were a little upset with the way that I
described locs Eaton's cruelty-free
status the way that I worded it I can
see why some cruelty free consumers
would have been a little bit like come
on Jen what I said was that locs eat on
does not test on animals but they do
sell in China and in China mandatory
animal testing is a law on imported
product so any products from foreign
companies to be sold to Chinese
consumers must be tested on animals
so I did mention that in there but I
also mentioned something that I found I
think it was on cruelty-free kitty I
can't remember exactly our leaping bunny
I think it was leaping bunny and it was
that L'Occitane is working really hard
with the Chinese government to to work
against animal testing at alternatives I
hadn't ever seen that in a statement
before usually like with L'Oreal and
other brands they'll say we don't test
on animals but we don't stop people from
testing on our behalf or something like
that and that's usually the limit of it
but I thought it was really cool that
they were working internally on that so
everything's going well I got an email
from the PR company saying that they
love the video they found it to be very
informative and they were looking
forward to the next video about 11:30 at
night Oh guess it was maybe two days
after the video went live video had
about almost 10,000 views at that point
I got a text message on my phone I
haven't I I don't remember giving the PR
company my phone number but it's
definitely possible that I did because I
forget things sometimes and it's a PR
company so I don't mind giving them my
phone number so I get a text message on
my phone Jen you need to take the video
down right now what what do you mean I
need to take the video down are you
talking about so I immediately put the
the video on private which means that I
can watch it but no one else can even if
you have a link you can't watch it the
only one that can watch it is me from my
account
so I texted her back oh my gosh what
happened she said well I'm on my way to
an event the person from the PR company
but I will call you on Monday I think
this is like a Friday or something or a
Saturday I don't I don't remember but I
think I put the video up on Thursday
anyway that's not important so I kind of
said well if you can get back to me
before then I don't really appreciate it
because I'm kind of freaking out so she
actually called me instead of going you
know she was on her way to an event but
she called me because she knew how upset
I was and I thought that was really nice
of her to do that she called me and she
said well Loxy Tom's not happy with your
video and I said okay I said can you
tell me why they're not happy well you
know the Cole thing and they didn't
really like that you talked about them
they're cruelty free status they didn't
like that okay and also the way you
described their ingredients you know it
wasn't what they wanted in the video I
said well was there anything in it and
not
get rid in what I said well you know
it's not that it wasn't accurate I mean
I'm paraphrasing here what's not that
wasn't accurate they just didn't like
what you said about the ingredients and
it could cause legal problems for them
it's like okay
it could cause legal project okay all
right um so do they want me to do the
next video and she says back well we're
not really sure so I said okay let me do
this this is what we'll do
I will do my research on the almond line
I will type up a sheep you know all my
notes the way I normally do to film
videos I will type it up I will send it
to you you can run it by lock seat ons
see what they say so what I did was I
trimmed down the cruelty free spiel and
I just said lock seat ons not cruelty
free moving on because they're not they
sell in China therefore they're not
cruelty free I said they're not cruelty
free and then I went into the
ingredients like I always do so this is
what I get back from the company I only
find it thanks for this Jen to confirm
you plan to include everything below in
your video
knowing that ingredient claims and the
cruelty-free elements were of particular
sensitivity to them
what is it non-negotiable to you and
this was my response again I will put it
up on the screen for you honestly person
from the PR company I don't think I can
compromise my integrity on this one I
include include cruelty free status in
all of my reviews if I leave it out I'll
be betraying my own brand additionally I
always talk about ingredients that my
viewers need to be aware of omitting
this information would also be unusual
and a betrayal of the trust that my
viewers have in my content so I guess
I'm saying this is a non-negotiable I
would be willing to work with wording in
order to correct any inaccuracies but I
am NOT going to sugarcoat / lie to my
subscribers when I sign up for this
campaign I was told I would quote share
your L'Occitane products into youtube
videos where creative control is
entirely up to you I accidentally left
that part out but that was in the
initial email was creative control is
entirely up to you this is what I have
done and I'm willing to do for LOX eat
on if they are not okay with the
conditions of the agreement I understand
but I want to make sure they know I am
not the one in breach of contract I have
and I'm offering to provide exactly what
I signed up to do they are changing the
rule
in the middle of the game to the person
in the PR company I do appreciate you
working with me on this and I'm so sorry
that it has come to this I'm glad that
we can work through this and learn
together and then I signed it and I
heard back maybe a day or two later that
lots of times did not want me to make
the second video and not only did they
not want me to make a second video they
were not going to pay me at all
nothing for all of the work I did
creating the first video and my heart
started beating I was like I worked
really hard on that video they're gonna
pay me you know like because that was
the deal you know is that I make the
video and they pay me that was all that
was basically in the contract and now
they're breaking the contract so I was
livid I was absolutely livid I exited
the person from the PR company and I
said this is absolutely ridiculous said
if they are not going to pay me then I'm
going to be getting my lawyers involved
and that was what I said and I meant it
too it was the fact that they were going
to just run away and say you know and
treat me like that how dare they treat
me like that you know that was what I
was thinking in that moment how how can
they do that to me I have done a job you
don't hire a plumber to come over to
your house and do a job and then after
they do it and they've done it well and
they fixed the pipes exactly what you
did in the contract they didn't use a
specific kind of pipe so you're not
gonna pay them even though you never
told him to use that specific kind of
pipe you know what I mean like you can't
do that you don't do that it's illegal
you don't do that to people so I was
really really mad eventually I got on
the phone with the PR company at this
point I haven't talked to L'Occitane at
all the PR company has been talking to
them the entire time and I they told me
it's gonna be a short phone call and I
was busy and I was like okay it's gonna
be short clone phone call fine I was
actually going I was making dinner for
my kids and I was on my way out the door
and I was on this phone call and I was
just livid it was not a good time for me
to be on that kind of phone call and I
went off and I was like this is
absolutely ridiculous
so what ended up happening long story
short was that I got a text message from
the PR company later that night and they
said that they would pay me the money
for
the collaboration in full and that
Lochte time would not pay me but that
they would pay me and I don't know like
what their logic was behind it because I
don't feel like it's my place to ask why
they chose to do that and I don't know
if they would tell me if I did ask so I
have been paid just not by lock seat on
so now this is where I'm gonna kind of
interject some of my opinions up to this
point it has all been fact even if it
has been the fact that I have felt I
felt a certain way in the situation it
has all been fact so this is the way I
feel right now it's possible that the PR
company didn't share the information
from my initial email before product was
sent
it's possible they did not share that
with l'occitane and approved it within
the company rather than sharing with
Loxy time because I did do exactly what
I said I was gonna do before the product
was even sent so there was a problem
with that then products never should
have been sent in the first place so I
do feel like the PR company is at fault
in some way in that somehow there was a
communication breakdown and I didn't
speak to Locke to Tone Loc ston didn't
speak to me so it was something within
the PR company where I have a problem
with l'occitane is the fact that they
expected it to be a glowing review that
they saw me as an employee rather than
an independent contractor which is what
I am and that bothered me the you my my
reviews cannot be bought period and I
guess they didn't know that because
there are a lot of influencers that you
can pay them for a positive review
that's not to say other people in this
campaign were paid for a positive review
there was nothing in the contract that
said it had to be a positive review so
other influencers that spoke through
this campaign they probably didn't know
you know they they they just did what
they do and there was no way for them to
know what had to be a positive review
either I want to make sure that that's
clear because I don't want any other
influencers to look you to think that
about them because of my experience they
do need to beef up their their online
social media presence they need to if
they're going to survive in 2018 they've
got to do it I just feel like L'Occitane
doesn't know what they're doing when it
comes to social media presence they
don't know what they're doing
because if they did know what they're
doing they wouldn't have done what they
did to me they would have known better
because you you you just can't do that
because your trust the the people's
trust in you and your brand is
everything it's everything and if you
betray that trust people don't forget
they don't and it was just not a smart
move on their part I mean they are a
multi-million dollar maybe even billion
dollar brands I didn't ask for I didn't
wasn't getting paid that much it was the
principle of it you know that they
didn't want to pay me because of what I
said and you know I did go into things
about the ingredients that may not have
been positive and it was based on the
research that I did and I have cosmetic
chemists that are subscribed to this
channel I have people that are in
biology and scientific fields and
doctors subscribe to the channel they
expect me to give the best information
on these ingredients so I make sure I
work really really hard to use the best
sources possible scientific sources when
I give you information and when I can't
find anything that says the immortelle
flower will do anything for your skin
I'm not gonna sit up here and tell you
that it's going to keep you young and
beautiful just because the flower
doesn't wilt it just it doesn't I'm not
gonna do that that's ridiculous and if
they expect anybody to do that then they
need to really rethink whether they want
a social media presence at all because
that's not how it works well on some
channels it works that way so just not
on this one so at this point will I ever
buy anything from luck see ton again oh
no and a big reason why is because I
actually found an alternative to that
hand cream that I loved and it's from
shea moisture and it's really
inexpensive and it works just as good as
the expensive Loxy time stuff so that
was the only product I would have
continued to buy I'm no longer going to
purchase that and I'm not going to
purchase anything else at their
overpriced prices yes there are some
expensive ingredients in there but I
really think they need to formulate with
the best skincare benefits not the fancy
ingredients just because it's fancy
doesn't mean that it works just because
it's marketable doesn't mean that it
works and we as consumers need to make
sure we are being smart about what we're
purchasing and stop with the gimmicks
stop with the GIMP
so even though Locke seat on may not
think I'm advertiser friendly and that's
the truth
so I want to thank you so much for
watching this video I hope that you got
some good information out of it I would
love to know your thoughts in the
comments below what you thought of the
situation do you feel like Locke's Etan
was in the right in any way do you feel
like I was in the wrong in any way you
know we're we're are you thinking
because I am a very fluid flexible
thinker and if you see that I made any
mistakes along the way I really would
love to learn from you and see how I
could have done things better I mean I
personally don't see anything at this
point but that's where the collective
brain comes in and the collective brain
of Meg of Awesomeness where we help each
other to learn about things so feel free
to teach me from your perspective
everybody has different points of view
different experiences and I love to
learn from you so thank you again so
much for watching this video
mad love to you and I will see you in a
video very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
