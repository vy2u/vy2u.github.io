stormy seasonal favorites video it is
storming like crazy outside but it's
late and I want to film this video and I
want to get it done show there may be
some occasional rain and thunder sound
effects going on behind me and we're
just gonna have to roll with it alright
so let's just jump into my favorites cuz
I got so many I wanted to get into them
so let's start with hair okay favorites
and fails okay because this is a huge
fail this is the L'Oreal Paris hair
expertise ever sleek sulfate-free
smoothing system reparative smoothing
shampoo for over-processed hair let me
tell you this made my head so itchy like
my itchy itchy itchy I've never had a
shampoo make my hair so itchy like
honestly until I wash it again I my head
itch like all the times the point where
I'm like sitting at a meeting I'm
scratching my head and I'm keep
scratching my head and somebody was like
are you okay like because I was just
scratching my head too much and was so
embarrassing so this is a definite no it
dried my scalp out something terrible so
no on that one good one though I got in
a beauty box five this is the Marcel
gentle makeup remover for sensitive eyes
this stuff is amazing I compared it to
my Holy Grail I makeup remover which is
by mary kay it's the one that it looks
like oil um you can see I'm like down to
here on it I'm using it like crazy this
stuff is awesome totally totally
recommend you can see I'm going to bust
through these because I have so many
things all right next up I got in a new
Beauty test tube this is the key west a
low gentle a low facial cleansers got
thirty percent a low the stuff smells
like lemon heads it is amazing and it's
so effective it just smells really good
it's effective it feels good it doesn't
overly dry out my face I am in love with
this cleanser this is my new favorite
cleanser I do have another favorite
cleanser but it's an exfoliating
cleanser it's the Suki exfoliating
cleanser I will put that equal with this
but that one has these
so if you want to exfoliate and go with
the silky if you don't want exfoliating
go for this one really really love that
by the way I'm going to put all of these
in the description down below so in case
you missed something in case I go too
fast because I tend to do that just look
down in the description all right next
up another fail this is the time bomb
shine shine care white tea strawberry
ignoring facial serum by the bomb and I
did not like this at all I it's gone now
I've been I've used it all up and it
took me a long time to me all season to
use this up and yeah it didn't do
anything for me I mean it it felt wet it
did that and um it says it has alpha
hydroxy acid and things like that but I
didn't think it when I dropped it that's
how much I love it um yeah I just
slipped out of my hands slippery little
guy but yeah I mean it it's a facial
serum I saw no difference I saw no
results uh I don't know it didn't
moisturize it just I don't know maybe
there's some long-term benefits that I'm
not aware of but this was a no for me
would not repurchase next up this is the
vitamin C skin boost by the body shop
really really like this can you tell i
like citrusy sense this is vitamin c and
it smells like oranges and it's a
silicone based primer and i love this if
feels so smooth and amazing does
increase the longevity of my makeup and
really really enjoy this it just feels
really smooth makes my skin feel amazing
and i love it i love it and this is the
only skin product i've ever bought from
the body shop and i love it i'm gonna
have to get more now and then next all
right this I got in a box e-tron this is
the tarte maracuja bronzing serum at
first i really liked it and then I
slowly began to hate it to the point
where I can say I despise this product I
I really genuinely do number one it does
nothing as far as bronzing I can tell
why they don't have this on their
website i think maybe what happened is
they manufactured this product they
realized it sucked they realize it was
nothing they could do to doctor it up so
they put it in boxee charms
that's my thought it does have that
Mayor kuja oil in it so if you like the
mayor coil you may like this but the
smell is atrocious it smells horrible
yeah it just I don't even know how to
describe it like salty seawater II
rotten nastiness like if you left your
bathing suit in a plastic bag for a week
that's what this would smell like I
think with a little bit of coconut
thrown in I know some people really
loved it I did not like it all right
nail polish remover Oh amazing a new
discovery this is the Sephora instant
nail polish remover for glitter Oh in
love like put it on a pedestal it is
glowing it has a halo of angelic light
around it if you like glitter nail
polish get this this is why I love it
okay it's one of those where you stick
your finger in there but also I don't
want to ruin my polish don't take the
chance of ruining my polish I'm gonna
take off my polish I don't want to ah
but i want to show you what's in here
okay okay so it's got this little pad in
there and it's rough so you rub your
nail against that and then that's what
takes the glitter off so that's inside
there I'm gonna have to put it all the
way back in later but the rest of the
sponge is extremely soft so it's like
this squishy softness and then this
rough that takes your your glitter off
and it's just it's perfect it's perfect
it works so well okay moving into
perfume on my scent bird subscription oh
my gosh I am in love with set bird I
will put my referral link down below I
was originally sent this for promotion
but then I end up and went ahead and got
a subscription for it if you do sign up
using my link i do get credits toward
free perfume so and that's a perk for
anybody that signs up for kind of like
epsy points and things like that so I'll
tell you about the three perfumes that I
tried this month it's fifteen dollars a
month and you get a vile like this it's
almost the size of a rollerball for
fifteen dollars a month you get to
choose which one you want to try and it
comes in this really you put it in this
really cool travel case you can see it
it screws up and down and then you just
replace it every month and I use this
one this is Dolce Gabbana's the one I
use this like everyday and
I still have a lot left this one's
amazing this one had luck has like a
vanilla II like sweet kind of scent but
it's not overly sweet it's like a mature
vanilla kind of set then I also got this
one is juicy couture's Viva La Juicy
gold couture this one is very very sweet
and sugary I mean this one is like
sugared candy sweetness it's really
really nice this one is a younger
fragrance it's less mature but I don't
even care because it smells so good i
really love it I love it love it and
then this one was the first one that I
had originally gotten and this is
burberry brit it says EDT i'm not quite
sure what that means but um but this one
smells amazing you can see how much I
used of that one just amazing yeah this
one has more of them this one's more of
a citrusy fruity floral and it's
beautiful it's a beautiful beautiful
very feminine scent so I'm about to get
Versace zweite something I don't know um
it's like a yellow bottle and I'm really
excited to get that it's really citrusy
a tempered is amazing so if you're
interested in more information about
that i will link that down below and
feel free to use my referral code or not
it's totally up to you if you want to
sign up just sign up with you use my
referral code or not one skincare thing
i'll just do real quick with this Laura
Mercier flawless skin face polish I
really really like this a lot this was
just the sample size it's just something
about this peach color oh no I'm wasting
it it's like a peach color I've never
seen a product that's actually peach
colored like that all this thunder
goodness I'm just gonna keep on filming
till the lights go out it's a lot of
sandy like very fine grit and it and
just feels good you know she's gives you
that gud scrub where you know you're
getting the junk off your face and just
feels good and I really like it a lot
alright nails nail stamping I have been
addicted to nail stamping sand I have a
full nail stamping tutorial for
beginners i will link that down below so
so fun you see cool prints on my nails
in my videos it's either a nail wrap or
its stamping and i love nail stamping
but if you want to know more about this
i'll link that video down below moving
on let's go to foundation foundation
favorite foundation the season was the
maybelline fit me matte and poreless
this is for normal to oily skin I've
heard that this is terrible for dry skin
so if you have dry skin do not get this
i am the shade 120 classic ivory and
this matches me perfectly i love this
stuff I really feel like you could trick
me into believing that this is a
high-end foundation if you've read
package this or put this in a sealed
pack and said try this I would have
thought this was high and it leaves its
NAT I don't need a powder if I don't
want what I usually use one anyway
because that's just what I do but I
don't need a powder it has a really long
wear time look really really long where
time doesn't cake up on me doesn't
oxidize it's just a beautiful foundation
and I love it but again not for dry skin
contour the Smashbox contour palette
have been loving this but only for this
shade I am using the stink out of this
thing I wouldn't be surprised if I hit
pan on it soon I uses a contour almost
every single day this shade was the
first contour shade that I actually
contoured successfully with and I'm very
excited about it it's that neutrally
brown it's not to oranjee it's just
perfect for contouring I'm wearing it
today I don't know if you can see it but
I'm wearing it today and I love it the
highlight does nothing for me and the
bronzer is just okay but the contour
shade perfect let's go to eyes eyeshadow
eye to eye shadow palettes that I
recently did reviews on this is the
l'oreal appellate nude 1i got six
drugstore eyeshadow palettes i got the
hard candy ones i got the maybelline
blushed and i got both of the nudes
palette this is by far my favorite of
all of them they are really really nice
you create some beautiful looks with
them they're creamy they're they're
relatively easy to work with the shade
range is perfect in here you've got nice
lights medium starts and the brush in
here is actually quite functional I
really really like that it's just a
really really nice palette especially
for drug store and not exactly
comparable to my high end as far as
quality but still a really really nice
palette moving to my favorite high-end
palette these two faced sugarpop palette
which I have another i will like that
review down below if you're interested
in that it's a sugary sweet eyeshadow
collection my only critique about this
is it doesn't snow like sugar I wish
that it did they
you make all their eyeshadows and
products sent it and everybody will be
in love forever by just the gorgeousness
of these shades I'm wearing that
macaroon shade on my eyes now I actually
have a tutorial for this I look that i
did that i will link that down below
that's along with me the review for this
palette i have the tutorial for this
look but just really fun to play with
those nice bright colors for spring and
summer and just so excited to use this
more it's really really really really
happy with this palette quality ease of
use I mean so easy to use so easy to
blend so easy to make them they don't
look money ever because the colors are
so contrasting but not so contrasting
that they don't blend nicely together
but yes highly recommend this and I am
in love with it alright got a few more
makeup products and then we're done all
right let's move on to this eyeliner
this is the tart multiply lash enhancing
liquid eyeliner I don't know about the
lash enhancing part but this is a
fantastic eyeliner yeah if you've
watched my channel for a while you know
that the Jessie's Girl liquid eyeliner
is my fave it's like eight bucks you can
get it Jessie scroll online and then
some rite aid's it's amazing I would say
this one is comparable to that one even
though it start I think I might like
this one just a little bit better just
because I feel like the brush tip lasts
just a little bit longer but for the
price honestly I would probably get the
Jessie's Girl but if you don't want to
get the Jessie's Girl you can't get your
hands on the Jessie's Girl I would
recommend this one it's got a nice fine
point so you can see it's got a nice
fine point it just draws a beautiful
nice thin line or you can make it
thicker if you want to it's black black
black opaque beautifulness very easy to
use take good care of this tip and it
will take good care of you I mean just a
beautiful beautiful easy to use liner
and I think it's the tip that sells me
on these and that's what really makes a
difference is whether the tip has to be
Ben Z but not too bendy you know it has
to be stiff not too stiff pointy you
know but not so pointy that it's hard to
work with has have the right amount of
product coming out it can't seep into my
fine lines you know i mean this this has
everything in it i would
highly recommend this I got this on
hautelook for a discount and I'll do my
like link down below all these things
i'm linking down below all right lancome
stills booster XL this was a repurchase
this is their last primer it is my fav
lash primer i know there are some other
really good ones out there but this one
happens to be my favorite the only
drawback to this one is it is white when
it comes out so your mascara can look
gray depending on what mascara you use
but if you use a nice opaque mascara I
don't think that you can see the white
through it at all and it definitely
thickens and lengthen lengthen to my
lashes and enhances any mascara that I
use so very very happy with that the
only ones that it will not help me with
are these two mascaras which are my
mascara want walls of the season and
this one is the julep go big mascara
this stuff this was terrible it's an
ineffective mascara the wand is just
stupid I don't know what they were
thinking with that wand it's just
useless it's got those giant spaces so
the lashes end up just clumping together
the product just does not do anything I
do girl I like a lot of julep makeup
products I do not like that also the
covergirl full lash bloom waterproof
mascara i hated this as well completely
ineffective and very difficult to take
off because of the waterproof they got
me on the packaging I love this color
and it just sucks it's a terrible
mascara it does not work for me at all
we've got those rubber bristles so it is
a little bit painful to use if you're
sensitive to that it's an ineffective
mascara for me I don't like it at all
but for effective mascaras the
Maybelline lash sensational mascara has
been a big win for me I have really
really liked this one a lot so if you're
going to go for a mascara from the
drugstore I would recommend this one
there is the one there it is a curved
wand and it is plastic but it doesn't
seem to have that same poke eNOS that
the other ones have like the benefits
they're real mascara and things like
that you know they have this poky pneus
to them this one does not seem to do
that and this really does lengthen and
volumize my lashes is it the most
dramatic fall / look no but it's close
okay it's definitely close and I think
for a drugstore price this is definitely
definitely worth it I think it compares
to some of my high-end mascaras and I've
been very very happy with this it's easy
to remove it doesn't flake it's amazing
and I really really like it a lot and
then last we're going to go to lips and
I have to lip favorites and they're both
from Too Faced this is the melted metal
liquefied metallic lipstick and I was
wearing this earlier today and I ended
up covering it with something else but I
really hope this metallic look catches
on as a trend I just really love that
shine then I just think it looks so cool
and I would seriously i would buy this
whole line if i could spend 22 dollars
on lip products i would buy this whole
line i love it i absolutely love the way
this looks i love the shine it just I
don't know it just makes me happy it
makes me feel good you know where lip
product just makes you feel good that's
the way that makes me feel I don't know
this one is my favorite formula it's
been my favorite formula for a while
it's the two-faced look for EM lipsticks
this is a naughty new this is a newer
purchase for me and it's just them you
know it's a pinky nude man it's typical
it's just a typical everyday wearable
lip color and it's just fabulous and it
just it goes really nicely with my skin
tone it feels really good it's
moisturizing doesn't have the longest
lasting time ever but it's just a nice
nudey biggie you know natural boring
color but I love it I love it so those
are my seasonal favorites that I only do
these videos every three months because
honestly I feel like I really want to
give you a comprehensive look at all the
things I've been trying to really show
you the best and the worst of what I've
been trying and I feel like the best way
to do that is just to give it to you
every season and just break it down for
you because I've had plenty of time to
try everything and I know where you know
whether the mascaras get better over
time I know whether the lipstick ends up
breaking I know you know whether the you
know I product dries out like I feel
like with three months I can really give
you a good solid best and worst of
beauty not to copy my friend Cassie but
it really is truly the best and worst of
beauty for the past three months I hope
you enjoyed that and if you did hit that
