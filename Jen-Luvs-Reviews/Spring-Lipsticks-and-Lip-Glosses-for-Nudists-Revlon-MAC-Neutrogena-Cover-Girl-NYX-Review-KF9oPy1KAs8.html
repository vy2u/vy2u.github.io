favorite subscriptions right now is
Jamie Barton she did a fantastic spring
lip video I'm going to link it there I'm
also going to link it down below where
she did swatches of different lip colors
now Jamie can get away if you don't know
Jamie's videos Jamie can get away with
pretty much any lip color um she's
gorgeous and she can wear the hot pink
she can wear red she can wear a neutral
she could even wear that girl could wear
green lipstick and it would look awesome
on her like I'm not even kidding but
some of us cannot pull this off so I
wanted to do a video on nude spring
lipsticks I went to the store justifying
it because I was going to shoot this
video and bought a bunch of different
brands of lip colors that just had a
tiny pop of color now that lip color I'm
wearing right now is going to be as dark
as it gets
I've got some fantastic suggestions for
those of you that are wanting to try a
little bit of color but are a little
scared of some of the brighter colors
out there okay first off I did get the
buzz agents a Neutrogena makeup and I
was really really happy with the stuff
that I got but my favorite thing that I
got which is really good for new to
south there is the moisture smooth color
stick very moisturizing
um pigmented but not crazy pigmented and
the color they gave us was sweet
watermelon and I will swatch that for
you and it looks pretty bright I'm going
to put it one so this one is a brighter
pink color um not quite super dude
but nude enough if you want to try a
pink color but don't want to be
completely scared off by it I just got
this one a few days ago love this one as
well this is another Neutrogena moisture
smooth color stick but this one is in
fresh papaya and you can see that one's
a little bit more peachy
now I wanted to try some other brands of
the same kind of formula and these are
the covergirl LipPerfection jumbo gloss
balm so these seem like they would be
similar to the Neutrogena one so I got
those and this one is in 205 and of
course they it's the worst packaging
ever because why can't they just put the
name of the color on here I will put the
color name right there it is number 205
and this one is a very very sheer and
this is another one of the color
covergirl LipPerfection jumbly lust
bones and this one is in the number 210
I will put the name of the color there
there's the swatch a little bit Pinker a
little more pigmentation on that one
when I saw the Maybelline Color whispers
come out I was expecting them to be less
pigmented than they are so I bought a
couple of them and they are not a low
pigmentation they are definitely a
lipstick I don't know why they're called
color whisperer I just don't get the
name I think it's very deceiving
but this one is in pinup peach and it is
the lightest one that I have found that
I have personally bought so I want to
share that one to you this was the one
that I was wearing at the beginning of
the video but I'll show you the swatch
of it hmm
so there's the swatch of that one and
now these are my new favorite lip
product oh my goodness ladies these are
amazing they are the new NYX butter
glosses
I am dying over these things I when I
put this on I could not believe it now
this is a lip gloss kind of set up here
we've got the doe foot applicator let me
show you how gorgeous oh my goodness
ladies you will not believe this and
this one is in creme brulee okay again
more of a gloss format it's like a light
peach ish kind of color not coral at all
but just a light peach
I mean for nudists this is amazing if
you used to wearing just lipgloss and
you want to try something with just a
little bit of pigmentation go for these
they smell amazing they're like just a
hint of sweetness just a hint hey and I
did get two of these I've got to get
more they're amazing this one is in
vanilla cream pie you can see a little
bit brighter of a pink there look at on
the lips it's really not super super
pigmented it gives that really nice pop
of pink color without being overwhelming
now I have been going drugstore crazy
lately I have not gone to Sephora I have
gone to Ulta but I haven't ventured into
the $20 lipstick line because I would
much rather get for drugstore lip
products rather than one high-end lip
products that's just kind of where I'm
at right now because I just want to try
a million things but this was my Mac my
go-to Mac lip stick of last year and
this is in a shy girl and it is a nice
um just like a peachy nude color
now ladies in my quest to find you
beautiful nude glosses and lipsticks for
the spring I did find a formula that I
did not like and it is people are gonna
if you love these I apologize you love
them I do not like them and I have to
read this because I can't remember the
whole name I don't know where they come
up with these names
L'Oreal color riche caress wet shine
stain and I got two of them I got one
and eternally nude which is one ninety
three and one in pink it is a stone in
one eighty three and ladies these were
the water iasts lip products I have ever
used it is a very strange brush doe foot
applicator that looks almost like a
pedal of some kind or a leaf this is the
one and eternally nude and yes it is a
nice nude color the smell is very
medicinal I don't enjoy it's very very
wet like slimy wet
and this is pink elisee stones now the
lips are getting a little irritated at
this point from wiping off so many lip
colors one on the side I ran out of room
again
yeah just if you can stand the smell and
the sly meanness of it you might like it
I personally do not enjoy these are
going back to the store these are not
worth ten dollars a piece for me I did
get them buy one get one half off but
still still not worth it to me and the
very last one that I want to show you
and the reason why I say for Less is
because it is a bomb stain it does stain
my lips and it stays on forever and this
is the only one that I would recommend
for nudists like you and me even though
I have many of them there are wait
eleven more way too bright for me but
this one is in honey and it's beautiful
so I've used it quite a bit like a multi
pink so nudists out there don't be
scared of buying lip color this spring
there are lip colors out there for you
hopefully you found some ones that you
like so some other options for you are
Maybelline Baby Lips those are amazing
if you want something just to step up
from a chapstick also the NYC lip
glosses if you can find one of the nude
colors New York City is gorgeous but
there are so many options out there
especially at the drugstore but
definitely be careful because there are
way more highly pigmented very bright
colors out there then there are nude
colors so stick to those last couple or
you will probably end up feeling like
you mean to give a return something
because it is just too right I hope you
