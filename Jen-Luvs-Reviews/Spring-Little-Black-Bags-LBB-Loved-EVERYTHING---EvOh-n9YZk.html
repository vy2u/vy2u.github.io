have owed you a little black video
little black bag I have owed you a
little black bit I can't even say it
hello my friends I have not done a
little black bag video in a very long
time so I've got some stuff to show you
I went to little black bag and I opened
up a bag and I ended up with a bunch of
stuff that I didn't like i gifted some
of the stuff to myself so that I could
trade it at a later date i'm going to
show you what i ended up keeping from
that first bag and then what i ended up
using the remaining items for so that i
could trade to get more stuff if you
know what I mean so this is kind of like
two bags in one I don't know if that
makes sense if you don't know about
little black bag or how it works I'm
going to link some of my older videos
below so you can kind of get a little
bit better idea of what it is how it all
works and you can always go to little
black bag calm I will put my referral
link down below in case you are
interested in that they have a
frequently asked questions section on
the little black bag website so you can
go there and find out more information
if you need to so let me show you what I
got in my first little black bag I feel
like forty dollars for each bag give or
take a dollar or two including shipping
so all together all of this cost me
eighty dollars total so the first thing
I got shipped to me from my first bag
was these earrings and if you have seen
my little black bag videos before you
know i love these philippe threader
earrings they are so stinking cute they
go you know in that creepy i have some
rose gold ones and i really wanted the
silver ones so i got these and i love
them i think they're so cute because i
can wear them dressy casual they're
awesome hey the second thing i got sent
to me was this bracelet and i just love
this soap this bracelet is so stinking
cute and this is the back and how it
opens is it opens behind the flower
there and i'll show you the kind of the
size i can slip it on and it kind of
hangs there so it's a little tiny bit
big for me but i really really like this
bracelet i get so many compliments on it
when I wear it
it's just it's perfect it's totally my
style and I just adore this bracelet ok
the other thing that I got shipped to me
in that first bag was a sample of that
gal brightening face primer by benefit
and I like this I don't really see much
difference um than the professional I
don't have really big pores so I don't
really see that poor difference with the
professional but as far as makeup
staying power this stuff is really nice
i'll show you it comes out like a pink
and let me swatch it so you can see how
it blends and it's I mean it's a little
eliminating but it's not like crazy um
and honestly once i put my foundation of
my powder over it like it doesn't even
there's really no difference i mean it's
a nice primer but i wouldn't buy it
personally for the brightening aspect of
it i don't i think that's kind of bunk
so then I had a bunch of stuff that I
just it's not that I didn't want it I
stuff was okay it just I wasn't crazy
about it so i figured i would gift it to
myself which cost six extra dollars
which I wasn't didn't really know that I
thought it was just paying for the
shipping on the next bag but that didn't
really happen that way cost an extra six
dollars to get things to yourself to
trade at a later date and then I ended
up with two pairs of shoes and a bag
okay because little black bag had a
really really awesome promotion if you
bought a pair of shoes you got a bag
with it I ended up trading that bag away
for a different pair of shoes and then
pairing the other pair of shoes with
some jewelry items in order to get my
bag so that's kind of how that all
worked out so the shoes are both the
same I got these studded um ballet
slippers which oh my gosh I'm so in love
with these things I got them in a like a
ballet pink and then I got them in the
pewter color and I love these things
they are buying wanted and my own my
biggest complaint about these is it took
about three times wearing them for them
not to hurt my feet I had to wear
band-aids in the back of my heels so
that they didn't rub here I was
expecting them not to be so stiff and
firm i was expecting them to be softer i
have some ballet flats that are nice and
soft
these are very structured so just be
aware of that and that they may need
some breaking in for you to enjoy
wearing them these are a seven and a
half I usually float between a seven and
a seven and a half and these fit me
perfectly i'm so glad i didn't get the
727 would been way too small so i really
really like these shoes yay shoes and I
really was good i was going to get
ballet flats anyway I wanted so many
ways so it worked out really well for me
and I had to trade all the rest of my
stuff for this bag all my stuff on my
necklaces and my earrings and all that
but I wanted this bag look how stinkin
cute this bag is it's by penny sue and
this is my second bag by penny soon and
it is the Milan shoulder bag in the
lilac and I absolutely love this bag and
it's the back and I didn't even take the
stuffing out of it because I've been
waiting to show you and it's got the
leopard print inside if you can see that
for a smaller bag it's pretty roomy $79
is the retail price on this so you've
got an inside little pocket here and
then you've got the like cell phone II
kind of pockets in the back and it's
pretty deep you know I mean you're my
arm goes in pretty far and then it's got
a zipper on the front and it's got the
same print inside and a pouch in the
front lots of little pockets for all the
things that you may want or need so oh
and it's got this cute little luck here
isn't that adorable I don't know just
these little details I just think are
awesome so super super happy with this
bag now I cannot wait to carry it I was
waiting to show you before I carried it
this is the bag that I really really
wanted and I'm so happy that I got it
even though I had to trade almost my
firstborn child to get this back alright
so that is what i got from little black
bag so overall I'll put my retail value
of everything there I what I paid and
what I got and I'm super happy with
everything I'm usually happy with
everything I get from a little black bag
I do have a trading video coming up

questions about how I trade and how I
get the most out of my money I do
