favorites video I you know I found it
because of all the subscription boxes
that i do and trying to fit in reviews
of things that i buy on the whim I don't
have time to do monthly favorites let
alone friday favorites I mad people do
friday there is every single week it's
like I don't know how you commit to that
but I i do want to do a spring favorites
video show you the things that I've been
loving this spring and I'm so excited to
show you some of you so they start with
my pink eye adventure okay so my son
developed pink eye and if you don't know
what that is it's an infection in your
eye that's highly contagious I took him
to the doctor got the medicine 24 hours
later he wasn't contagious but my
daughter had it and then got her the
medicine and then and before you know
what I've got it so I was out of work
for a day I thought that I was past the
point where i was going to get it so i
was using some of my makeup but
unfortunately i had some makeup
casualties to the pinkeye war so the
things that I lost the pinkeye were were
some really big favorites of mine the
first was this lash combination that i
want to show you this is the smashbox
full exposure mascara oh my gosh i love
this stuff it's really nice volumizing
mascara not the biggest length in the
world of a definitely lengthening but
not like a fall / length what this does
really nicely it separates my lashes
beautifully and it also volumizes my
lashes just makes me look like I could I
have a gazillion not volumizes because
it doesn't make my lashes look thicker
it just makes them look like there's
lots of them they're all separated and
beautiful and I love this mascara the
wand is a little gigantic that's my only
big criticism of it is that it's just a
you know kind of maneuver if you have
small eyes this may be difficult for you
to use but I do love this mascara so i
would put this on first and then i would
top it off with the lash out butterfly
mascara by l'oreal and I know I'm late
to the game on reviewing this but i do
really really love this mascara this
adds that length that I'm looking for
and this one has that really weird funky
wand it's I only use this
an event the weird funky side that kind
of curves up when I noticed when I put
this on by itself is it did kind of
spider out and clump my lashes together
a little bit so I did not like this by
itself but on top of the Smashbox or any
kind of volumizing or any kind of
mascara that actually separates your
lashes putting this on top was a dream
and I'm so sad to have to throw these
away you know I'm not trying to peg I
again you don't say I got two more
casualties from the pinkeye war and this
was the Jessie's Girl eyeliner I will be
repurchasing this this stuff was amazing
i got this in i'm at it's just a
beautiful beautiful mess up mascara it's
just a beautiful beautiful liner and
makes a gorgeous line and my favorite
thing about this liner is that when i
make my little wing which i finally
figured out how to do and what I had to
do to learn how to do the wing was just
stop listening to people and just start
with a little tiny teeny tiny little
wing on both sides and then just slowly
making it longer each time that I did in
and I finally feel like I have a
functional weighing on my sides of my
face so thing about the Jessie's Girl
liner is when I make my wing and
sometimes I'm like scratch my eye or
whatever and no liner ever had stayed on
through the scratching of my eye except
for this one and this is a drugstore
liner I think it's like 10 bucks so I
think it's a higher more expensive drug
store liner you can buy these at most
rite aids and and we can buy Jesse
scroll online but definitely highly
recommend this does not seep into my
fine lines very easy to draw that line
and this is the one that broke that wing
for me so that I can now do broke the
wing that doesn't make sense but it
finally made it so that I could do that
way I don't know if it was just the
practice and that's just pushed it over
the edge or if this actually contributed
to it I don't know but I'm just in love
with this liner and will be repurchasing
it next time I go to a writing yeah last
casualty of my award this one was
actually almost out so I wasn't real sad
about it because of this I was like
digging into the last of this is rapid
lash now I heard about this originally
from Erica who has a channel called from
brains to beauty and about a year ago
she made a video about this and said how
amazing it was and she showed it before
and after pictures I was like oh my
goodness I want that and then I found
out it was like $45 I was like okay
maybe I don't want that then I saw it on
a Groupon
I saw it on hautelook that same weekend
ended up buying it and it discounted
forget exactly how much I paid for it
but it was at least I was probably
around 3035 dollars and it was worth
every stinking penny I'm not even 10 I
don't give in to the hype on things let
me tell you if somebody tells me that
something's going to lengthen my lashes
i'm usually lucky yeah right that's not
going to work this stuff totally works
i'm not even kidding i know there's
another brand people are talking about
that really works well but this one I
would definitely recommend I'm i
actually already repurchased it at Ulta
I've had a twenty percent off coupon of
any one item and it did work on this and
that was one of the ones that you can't
get the prestige items or whatever like
you can't get the super expensive stuff
with that twenty percent off you can get
this with that twenty percent off so i
ended up getting less for like 35 bucks
worth every single penny and i've been
using this since februari something like
that and now it's the end of May and I'm
finally out of it and it totally oh love
the stuff I could say the same thing
over and over again but I think you get
the point because I have short stubby
little itty-bitty nothing lashes and
this now i actually have lashes so very
thankful for this and love it okay next
up hair I Adama this is the n roots
conditioning treatment mask by the boma
and the bomb should be coming back on
hautelook hope Luke the bomb should be
going back on hautelook in either june
or july if they follow that same three
to four months of pattern so keep an eye
out for this this stuff is amazing it
makes my hair so stinkin soft and I've
noticed sometimes I'm kind of a rush I
kind of rush it it says to leave on for
ten minutes sometimes don't leave it on
for like five and i still get amazing
results from it just makes my hair super
soft super smooth my hair is very
damaged i have not got a cut since
october and this stuff makes it look
like i had just got a haircut i swear
this stuff is amazing highly recommend
and next up all right we've got the
hydro glaze moving the lips hydra claims
by glamour doll eyes adjust talked about
this in my glamour doll eyes review
video for may and this stuff is amazing
i'm wearing it today this what i was
saying in that video I'll say again feel
free to skip ahead if you saw that video
but what I love about this is it is not
super super pigmented to the point where
it looks like i have paint on my lips I
do not personally enjoy that look
I but I do like a color in my lip gloss
so this is that happy medium between a
lipstick or a very pigmented gloss and a
gloss that's just a wash of color this
has a really really nice nice color
payoff but not painted color payoff and
this one is in the color crimson nebula
highly highly highly recommend this and
you can get this from the glamour doll
eyes website next lip item is another
smaller company ish because I think
L'Oreal actually has a part of this
company and this is M cosmetics by
Michelle Phan and this is her lipstick
in nude lace and this is I'm very much
into the nude lips into the your lips
but better look nothing too wild and
crazy this is about as bright as I go
maybe a little brighter than this but
not too much brighter than this and I
just absolutely love this color just a
really really nice nude color but not to
new doesn't make you look dead you know
so very very very happy with this
lipstick i love how creamy it is lasting
power is pretty typical for a lipstick
smell is on the lip sticky side but has
a little bit of a fruity scent but it's
not a strong lipstick II smell it's not
an offensive lipstick II smell my last
big favorite is the it cosmetics bronzer
this is the radiance ombre bronzer oh I
love this thing okay so what I've been
doing with this lately has been putting
it on and then putting my blush over top
of it just to get kind of warm up my
face a little bit make me feel like it's
a little more like summertime and this
is just a gorgeous gorgeous natural
bronze but you can get let me show you
because it has that hombre you can get
you can put your brush up here and get
more of a shimmer put it down there and
get less of a shimmer so this is the
fair top and that's the very bottom or
you can get that happy medium in the
middle and I love this because it is a
very long lasting color on my cheeks I
do have normal skin so I don't know how
this would last on someone with oily
skin I would imagine it would be
beautiful on most skin tones it's just I
really really love love love this
bronzer I know it's not a new product
but it is something I have really been
enjoying the sprint so that is the end
