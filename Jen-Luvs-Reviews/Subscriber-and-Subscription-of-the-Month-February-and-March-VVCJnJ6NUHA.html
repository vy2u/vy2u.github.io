shut up and just get to the point hello
everyone if you are relatively new to
this channel you may not know that I do
this but this is just a really fun way
for me to say thank you to my
subscribers and people that I am
subscribed to for just being generally
awesome um I have been doing this for a
few months now and I really really enjoy
it my subscribers of the month and
subscriptions the subscriptions of the
month get a little gift in the mail from
me if I can get a hold of their address
and usually the gift is worth between
five and fifteen dollars just to say
thank you for being fabulous my
subscribers of the month all you have to
do is be subscribed to my channel in
order to be qualified to be subscriber
of the month it does help if you comment
on my videos so that I can kind of get
to know you a little bit now I did not
do this for februari this is now for
februari and for March because I slacked
last month my subscriber of the month is
sick Cynthia J thumb chat thumb I
apologize if I am ruining your name
Cindy girl I appreciate you you are so
awesome Cindy is always commenting on my
videos not just on my videos but on my
friends videos I'm constantly seeing her
name pop up she's just such a sweetheart
and I hope that one day Cindy you make
some videos because I know you started
making videos and then you stopped
making videos and I really hope that you
get back into making them because I
really enjoyed the few that you may city
if you would send me your address I was
saying something the mail my next
subscriber of the month is someone she
she's very short in her comments but she
comments on like every single one of my
videos I am constantly seeing her name
pop up and I just appreciate her just
popping in to say hi and that she liked
the video and her username is pretty
mean gumbo and she is just so adorable
she does make videos and honestly a lot
of her videos are things were just
showing things that she's gotten from
other people from giveaways from his
friends sending her things from swaps um

for me to share with you a couple of
channels that
have just been absolutely digging this
month so my first subscription of the
month is Amelia st. John now amelia is a
makeup artist she is so incredibly
talented her tutorials are amazing she
does a lot Hall she does a lot of just
really just classic beauty community
video she does outfit of the day she
does hair tutorials and she's just
really good at it I'm surprised she
doesn't have more subscribers than she
does because she is so incredibly
talented so if you're interested in
those types of things i will put a link
to her channel down below i highly
suggest you check out her videos i think
you'll really enjoy them now my
subscription of the month for March is
sassy Heather 11 I have been loving her
videos she's kind of like me and that's
why I like her videos because you know
we all like people that are kind of like
ourselves we can kind of see ourselves
in this person and I see myself and
Heather i think if Heather and I live
near each other Heather and I would hang
out like all the time like it would be
like me and her and sassy Sopoaga Beauty
Carrie and Boni and a net and like we
would all just like hang out and have a
good time and go out and hurt you know
people like Melissa FML mphs she has a
friday favorites at a possible poo and
people have friday favorites and flops
and friday favorites and fails and fraud
you know all this stuff she's got friday
friday favorites and products that piss
me off i just love that i think that's
hilarious like she's just got that kind
of like air about her where would she's
loving something she's loving it when
she's not liking something you are
feeling it through that lens like you
could totally feel when she just can't
stand a product and I just love that
kind of passion in person and she's just
she's beautiful and fun our last video
she's like sick in it because she wanted
to make this video like announcing her
giveaway winner and she's like deathly
ill would she like put her makeup on and
she still looks gorgeous and you could
tell she just feels like complete crap

little easier for people and comments to
converse to really make threads and have
conversations and get to know each other
