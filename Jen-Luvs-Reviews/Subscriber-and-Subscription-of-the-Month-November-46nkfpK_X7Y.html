subscriber and subscription of the month
for november i started this last month
and i had said last month that the
winners only get Mike and my thank you
for being awesome and I decided to
change my mind on that what I ended up
doing for my subscriber and subscription
of the month last month as I sent them a
little gift in the mail that was worth
no it's somewhere less than $15
somewhere between five and fifteen
dollars just as a little thank you for
being awesome and being them all you
have to do to be my subscriber of the
month is to be subscribed to me and also
it does help if you comment on my videos
so that I can get to know you a little
bit if you don't have to make videos in
order to be my subscriber of the month
and actually my subscriber of the month
this month doesn't make videos I'll tell
you about her in just a minute now my
subscription of the month is a
subscription that you probably you might
know already they are very popular on
YouTube for beauty videos but if you
don't know them you should definitely go
check out their videos and because I'm
saying they some of you might already
know what I'm talking about and that is
11th or dress I do not miss an
eleventhgorgeous video when I come home
from work I look to see if there's a new
eleventhgorgeous video because it's like
my TV show they are hilarious they give
excellent reviews they're gorgeous like
I their eye shadow both of them they're
beautiful but they're eye shadow I don't
know how they do it but it is incredibly
flawless like and it's that whole look
that I love that light lid with a darker
crease love it um always they mess with
their lipstick sometimes sometimes I
love six light sometimes it's dark and
it's very inspiring
what makes me kind of want to try it
maybe I could do a darker lipstick even
though they're blonde and you know we
look completely different but um you
know I just I'm really inspired by their
videos they also have a vlog channel
that's really funny called the other
side of EG and that's another one of my
TV shows that i watch religiously so
congratulations to eleventhgorgeous
you're my subscription of the month i
will be sending you one thing for each
of you as just a little thank you for
being fabulous alright so for my
subscriber of the month I picked someone
that comments on my videos often she
just um she makes me smile the things
that she puts in the comments and I just
appreciate her and please excuse me if I
butcher your name harini aarthi you are
my subscriber of the month um I don't
know a whole lot about you so if you
could send me a little message about
your favorite things I know a little bit
about you from your comments but not
enough to know how to go shopping for
you so if you like lip glosses or if you
like nail polish your eye shadows or if
you've got your eye on something that
you know is within that five to fifteen
dollar range let me know maybe I can get
it for you um yeah just as my thank you
for being an awesome subscriber and I
appreciate you and I appreciate you
commenting on my videos now if i didn't
pick you as my subscriber of the month
please don't be discouraged i can i'm
only going to be picking 12 in a year so
that you know makes it it's hard for me
to pick i have a lot of people that i
wanted to pick but i just picked one so
it's not because i like her better than
you it's just I had to pick somebody and
if I had $1000000 i would pick everybody
you didn't get subscriber the month this
month knowing that i still appreciate
you yes you you person watching right
