month again mm-hmm it's Smackdown time
now last one that was a bit of a
negative nancy and i think the reason
why i was a negative nancy is because i
watched too many openings of other
people and made too many judgments
before i even open them so i was really
strict with myself I did not watch any
openings before shooting this video so
that I could be nice and fresh in my
opinions we're gonna go straight from
scratch we're going straight to birchbox
and find out what I got in Birchbox now
both of these subscription services are
ten dollars a month so it's nice easy to
compare apples to apples and we'll see
what kinds of things we got oh it's so
excited okay so inside the Birchbox oh
we got a little card and this says step
and repeat for february2014 and then
it's got the products on the back i'm
not going to look at okay first thing i
am seeing is DDF ultra light oil free
moisturizing do did I already get this
like I already got this in something I
got a little pat foil pack of this but I
haven't used it yet so I don't know how
it is but this is a big sample of it
this is one ounce usually Birchbox
doesn't send full ounces of things so
I'm excited to try that it is a
moisturizer let me see I'm gonna sort
some out and see strange noise ooh and
it means squirt that much had doesn't
have much of a smell to it I'll put it
on my hands um doesn't feel real oily
feels more smooth than oily on my hands
feels nice and again not a strong snow
which is really nice for those of you
that are sensitive to smells yeah we'll
definitely use this yeah it seeps into
my eat my hands very very quickly yeah I
think I'm going to enjoy this this is
nice cool oh no it's open like no joke
open and dried out I think that's not
good okay this is a cool of mineral
sunscreen and because of my lights this
happened last time I can see right
through the tube and the product goes to
hear but it might actually be dried out
this is a mineral
sunscreen so when I opened at the top
was off and then this is all crusty on
here that's not good oh it did come out
oops okay so it was gonna right to
complain about that the product was
dried out but it's not it just most of
the product just oozed on to my hand not
too happy about that I mean the product
it's it's really very very little
product it looks like it's point 17
fluid ounces or five milliliters which
is back dropping things stop it yeah I
mean it's a sunscreen I can always use
sunscreen it's unscented I've gotten a
product from kula before but I don't
remember what it was feels nice from I
just I didn't mean to rub it all over my
hand that I just put the moisturizer on
that just kind of mess with my first
impression but I don't want to use
anymore because there's currently any
product in here not excited about this
okay next I see a one hundred percent
pure fruit pigmented one hundred percent
natural mascara uh oh I have all this
moisturizer and sunscreen on my hands
and look what I just did I totally just
smeared the printing off of the
packaging oops I'm gonna go ahead and
open it because I'm curious and I don't
have too many mascaras open right now
okay typical wand does have a fruity
smell to it which is really weird
doesn't look like a super wet formula I
don't see any fibers or anything so I
will keep you updated on this and the
more I touch this the more the print is
rubbing off on my hand so I'm just not
going to touch it anymore I'm always
excited to see makeup products in birch
bark all right next up is a little pack
let's see okay I gotta hello hello by
harvey prints I occasionally watch
eleventhgorgeous and I did watch a video
of theirs where they talked about they
always get Harvey prints perfumes in
their birch boxes now it smells pretty
nice it's a little citrusy does it say
what the notes are on here Meyer lemon
Mandarin and grapefruit forsythia and
plumeria yeah that's what that smells
like it smells pretty nice a nice spring
sense i'm happy about it i don't mind
perfume samples i like perfume and then
the last thing in here is an agave oil
treatment which I'm always interested in
trying agave oil or any kind of oil
for my hair smooth restores transforms
on magic manageable frizzy hair so I
definitely have that at time so I'm
looking forward to trying that so
overall Birchbox was not bad this month
I've got this one I'm excited about this
I I mean I'll use it for what it is but
it's got very little product in it and
y'all know how them if that irritates me
and plus the cap was off and I don't
know I'm just a little irritated this
one I'm excited to try this and happy
about this actually what was the
Birchbox bonus this time oh and the
mascara excited to try the mascara so
there wasn't a bonus in here this month
that's kind of sad oh it says tinted mat
for the kula it says natural BB cream on
it it's just really small print well i
guess i just wasted half of that oh well
I'm really disappointed because I would
have liked to have used this once or
twice you know I'll probably get to use
it once Birchbox is a 3 out of 5 this
month which is better than it has been
on other boxes okay excited about MC
because I know this is very full because
I know there's at least one thing in
here that I actually got for you guys I
do get FC points for doing referrals and
when people sign up using my link I get
points and I whatever I see something
good in there i usually get it but like
this this is the benefit high beam i
actually already have a sample of this
that i don't know i have lots of it left
so i'm actually going to give this away
to you guys and that's why I got it I
had no intentions of keeping this this
lasts me honestly I've had that for like
a year and it's i'm still using i mean i
have lots of highlighters that I used
but I run out of this anytime soon so
this will be to one of you all if you
would like the benefit high beam you're
going to put a comment down below that
you were interested in that the first 24
hours the giveaway will be open all
you've to do is put a comment you're
entered in and then after 24 hours I
will announce who wins this and I will
send it to you here is the Ipsy bag it's
very very cute it's very sturdy the
zipper looks nice and it says FC here
very cute i'm like overloaded with these
little bags but i do like them I like
having them I like I put gifts and
things in them okay and the 40
first thing I'm seeing us eyelashes and
you all know me I don't wear false
eyelashes because I think they look
ridiculous on me and if I do wear them
they're the very very natural kind these
are not going to work for me holy
eyelashes Batman those things are
ridiculous they're made by Jay cat and I
believe we got that really terrible
eyeshadow quad from them that was like
straight it was like cream with like
glitter on top it was horrible but I've
never tried their eyelashes you guys can
have these two it says there is glue
included if you're interested in these
lashes I will never wear them they are
not my taste go ahead and put those into
a comment as well please only put a
comment for the different things you
want if you feel like you'll really use
them okay oh this is nice city color
being matte blush this is huge it's in
fresh melon not tested on animals that's
nice hey swatch oh it's so soft whoo
member i have all that lotion on my
hands so I'm just gonna reach down in
here get my arm pig met city yay very
excited about that that is like super
bright pigmented but I can totally work
with bright blushes I like bright
blushes do not scare me one thing that
my friend Kristen game did in a video
recently which I thought was super smart
which she also did a brush brush swatch
along with her fingers watch for the
blushes whoa it just powdered all over
the place so this is similar oh no on my
jeans so this is similar in the softness
as like my my the bomb blushes and my
Kat Von D blush so i'm going to go ahead
and do brush swatch so there's the rush
watch you can see all that powder coming
off so you just have to be gentle but
yeah really pretty so very excited about
that and thank you to Kristen for that
idea of doing the brush swatch if some
reason you've been living under a rock
and you don't know Kristen game you've
got to go over her channel and subscribe
she's amazing okay next I'm seeing
velvet gel by photo see what is that
fight OC fight o suta khals natural

read that I don't know what this is
let's just find out what it is special
gift for you it says on the
it's not really a gift I paid for it hey
they must use it as samples for
something what is that velvet gel I have
no idea what this is I'm gonna have to
look on the Ipsy website and find out
what is actually I don't have to look on
the FC website because they gave me a
card okay oh no I forgot if she doesn't
put information on their card I have no
idea what this is directions fight OC
velvet gel is supported by a brand new
clinically clinical study which
something its ability to promote and
encourage healing and provides
unsurpassed antioxidant protection
directions use twice daily use
fingertips to apply a small amount to
age spots and sunspots thankful not to

pass this on maybe to my grandma or my
mom or somebody that does have age spots

able to put them like all my freckles

I'm gonna pass this along oh oh oh yeah
I love my Zoya polishes love them hey
this is this is going to be my seventh
Zawya polish love love love their
formula a lot usually they're very very
opaque and that is gorgeous so excited
about that it's called Odette their
names just like julep they're named
after like women's names so pretty let's
do the drip test okay looks like a 12 to
cope polish whoo so excited about that
those of you that watch my last am I
getting ready with me video that I just
experimented with saw my part of my nail
polish collection I actually have two of
those racks one on top the other I got
them on amazon i think but i don't think
i have and he polishes this color so it
looks like the closest polishes that I
have to this color or this one by Nicole
by OPI this one's called one big happy
family those are kind of well no those
aren't similar and then this one by
julep no those aren't similar and then
this one by julep no those aren't
similar okay I don't have anything like
this very very
cited about this because it's more of a
warm to in purple and as you can see a
lot of my Purple's are very cool tone so
very very happy and excited about that
to me this pays for the entire I mean
pretty much the entire subscription when
i get is a way of nail polish because i
would buy these at full price easily
there's one more thing in here oh this
is exciting okay I got a pop beauty I
don't typically like pop beauty stuff
except for the last I shadow trio that
they sent by pop beauty i actually
really like that all except for one of
the shades i liked two out of the three
shades which is pretty good for pop
beauty i typically don't like anything
from them so maybe this lip gloss will
be good i've never tried one of their
lip glosses they sent a crayon stick
once that i liked definitely wasn't my
favorite but i liked it let's try it
this one is called PNE pedal and i like
the packaging it's like a velvety kind
of packaging here I like that let's say
very very opaque this is nice happy
about that very excited about that good
job pop beauty once again another win
from pop beauty I might have to stop
saying I don't like pop beauty because
last couple things have gotten for them
I've actually really liked so as far as
Apes egos we've got the high beam that I
got is a bonus perk and this is going to
one of you this I got the eyelashes
these are not my taste at all these are
going to go to one of you as well so I'm
not excited about those very excited
about the city color matte blush very
excited about the pop beauty lip what is
this call this is call it this is a I
don't know it doesn't say it just says
pop beauty and that just says peony
petals so I don't know what the formula
of this is called but whatever it is I'm
excited about it and then very very
excited about this way polish really
happy about that and then this velvet
gel will be passed along I'm sure
someone in my family will be excited
about that overall very very happy with
it see this month epsy I think wins out
