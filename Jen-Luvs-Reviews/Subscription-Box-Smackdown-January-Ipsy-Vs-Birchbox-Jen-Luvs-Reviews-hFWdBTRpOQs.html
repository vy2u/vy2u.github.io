week on Jen loves reviews seriously I've
so many boxes to open and this isn't the
end my friends I just uploaded a couple
days ago my new beauty test tube video
actually just shot at about 30 seconds
ago I finished shooting in and now i'm
shooting these but if you did watch that
it was kind of a bum tube if you feel
like checking it out i'll put the link
down below it's kind of bummed about it
but you know it is what it is so I'm
hoping that my Birchbox my Ipsy we'd
better thank you to everyone who signed
up for either Birchbox ripsey using my
referral link I have a friend named
Amanda Hearn she's been a subscriber of
mine since the very pretty much in the
very beginning her name a youtube name
is benefit girl 16 she's trying to get a
Beauty Blender and I would really love
to hook her up so if you're planning on
signing up for it see I would love if
you would use Amanda's link down below
Amanda just needs like two or three more
referrals and she'll be able to get her
beauty blender she might only need one
more she's an awesome girl she's so so
sweet she does have a youtube channel
that you can definitely check out if you
like have cheated and kind of looked at
some box openings and bag openings and I
don't have high hopes my friends don't
have high hopes and always will start
with birchbox because birchbox usually
is worse so I filthy want to end it on
an up note so I start with birchbox so
that I can end it with FC but I don't
again I don't have high hopes since
month oh by the way I'm gonna link to
some of my friends birchbox and ypsi box
openings down below in case you just
want to see more the theme this month is
go time whatever that even means this
year we're flipping resolutions on their
head hopefully I won't want to bang
myself in the head after I open this
birchbox we shall see that is how it
looks and there's a sticker and for
enter for a chance to win new prizes
every week grand prize is a
thousand-dollar shopping spree wouldn't
that be nice and it's got the website I
think that's where people that are
members of Birchbox so off to check that
out cuz I would love a thousand-dollar
Birchbox shopping spree that would be
amazing okay so here we go Toni &amp;amp; Guy
London salon heat protection missed
always happy to have heat protection
missed I got the what you call it the
collinar curls suck your hair up curly
thing and that thing I swear is sucking
the life out of my hair so I want to
make sure that I'm protecting it so I am
very excited to have a heat protection
mess I do use the Tresemme one that is
my holy grail but I'm always open to
trying new ones next up is the bus sun
to brighten up enzymatic face
rejuvenator and it looks like this this
tube is pretty empty I don't think you
can see it but the product open goes up
to here it's completely empty wait no
one on a minute bit shake it down so we
can see how much is in there cuz there's
a lot of open space in here the product
goes to here I seriously can see right
through it there's basically no products
in here it's 20 grams whatever that ends
up being so there is like very little
product in here even though it's a big
tube that makes me a little irritated
cuz that's extremely deceiving not just
straight up shows me as a company that
you're deceiving me and that just makes
me angry in general do you guys feel the
same way all right next up so happy
about this mad at this we'll see whether
it's actually any good mineral eyeshadow
by Anika okay in eternal marine comes
with a little sticker on the front hmm
that's pretty it's like a gray greenish
blueish kind of color swatch that very
shimmery you put a little bit more so
there is the swatch of eternal marina
overall really pretty pigmented see how
it blends good it doesn't blend away so
that's a good thing I like that it has a
sifter on top always a big fan of that
so yeah happy to have that I do enjoy
mineral eye shadows so excited to
actually get some makeup products from
birchbox doesn't usually happen so
really happy about that and then I
finally get to the card what is this
hello 2014 note to self be awesome do
you think I can do that
love to see introducing subscribers
sundays so it's like little cards and
has a bunch of stuff on the back like
motivational things okay cool points
pointer shop to earn are you missing the
points here's a foolproof way to justify
that next shopping spree every dollar
you spend earns one bartsch bach point
100 points equals ten dollars off all
right and then we get the little boxy
boxy it has good hopefully good stuff in
it o.o not happy about this my friends
didn't barge box see my last video i
told you i don't like tea i'm not a team
fan i got three packs of tea english tea
number one apricot sunrise and lemon
vitality not a thing of those will go to
my mom my mom loves this stuff and then
i got a perfume sample of juicy couture
smells like it to it I've never smelled
this one before I know that she could
she likes juicy couture stuff I don't
think this is the one that she talks
about it's kind of nice a little floral
it kind of reminds me of honeysuckle a
little bit I'll wear it it's a good
spring sense hold on to that for spring
yeah so happy about the eyeshadow happy
about the heat protectant spray that's
about it there were some people that got
these really cool nail polishes like
caviar nail polish things and i didn't
get one of those and I'm sad about that
I would have really liked to have gotten
that but I didn't so that's okay maybe
next time you guys ready to see eps8 all
right let's get into eps8 Gemma good he
come on ypsi all right here we go here's
the cool little baggie bag if you
haven't seen it yet it looks almost like
a skyline it's got these little makeup
products here I think it's super cute
feels really tough and rough and the
little ape see little Taggy thing on
here it smells like smells like my
neighbor's house when I was a little kid
smells just like her crack house she was
Korean and it smells just like her house
okay so it looks like I got the better
one of the MC bags it seems like there's
two version of empty bags and this was
the one I was hoping for this is a lady
or
Abby I want to say yay d because it
looks like it rhymes with baby but it
makes more yabbies sounds nicer to me a
natural finish liquid foundation and its
oil free so I'm going to put that on my
hand and see how that lucky let's try to
cover up this freckle a little bit let's
see how high coverage you are it looks
pretty relatively thick i'm just going
to use the tiniest little bit let's see
hey be yea dat baby hey be okay it looks
like it matches my skin tone pretty
nicely a nice medium color cool Thank
You epsy for sending me my skin tone I
appreciate it thank you yeah it's it
cover it up pretty nicely so happy about
that really looking forward to using
that all over my face ok this is the
mail in Mallen and goats mojito lip balm
daily protection let's see what this
stuff is like this is kind of weird that
the tip of it very rarely do i see a lip
balm with this kind of two because i
feel like that would squirt out too much
product you know i would think that they
would do more like a Vaseline type so
that it's easier to put on I guess you
put it on your finger maybe first oh
it's completely clear um no no it tastes
a little medicinal a little bit smells a
little medicinal yeah I'm not a big fan
of that I guess it does kind of smell
like a mojito a little bit that limey
minty kind of smell it's okay I'm not
gonna complain about it ooh professional
I love this this is actually my Holy
Grail face primer I've heard that that
new one is a lot like it though what is
it the baby skin but I haven't tried it
now this is a teeny tiny sample of
course a professional come on benefit
aren't you making enough money that you
can give us the regular size sample side
you got to give us this teeny tiny to
application kind come on benefit hook us
up but i do really love this and this
will get used and loved makeup cleansing
tissues i think i've seen these at TJ
maxx or marshalls or something but i've
never tried this kind and it is a
pomegranate extract one happy to try
those and then there's one more thing
seems like there's a lot of stuff in
here that's a good thing it's a body
balm balm me up organic sweet cocoa and
tangy body balm smells like so it smells
like lemon
I wasn't expecting that you it's like
oily here look dunno if you can see that
but it's like oily looking it's weird it
feels very smooth Oh feels nice little
oily but it feels nice so very strange
consistency for a bot well I guess it's
a body balm so I guess it's kind of like
a lip balm for your body definitely not
for oily skin i don't think i would
imagine some with oily skin would not
like more oil on them because it
definitely feels oily but i do feel like
it's moisturizing my hand pretty nicely
so i'm curious to use this more and then
that is it for ypsi this is the little
card car 19 reasons 2014 will be amazing
you know it would be amazing if see if
you included 19 products now that would
be amazing alright so that's my Ipsy bag
so overall excited for ypsi happy about
this happy about this anxious to keep
using this don't like this at all and
happy about this just wish the sample
size was a little bigger so I think even
though both of the boxes whoa if see am
birchbox both I think were not good this
month I I think epsy still is better
than Birchbox but I mean honestly I'm
not really excited about either one this
is such a bum month for subscription
boxes my my new Beauty test tube wasn't
very good my Ipsy is not very good my
birchbox isn't very good i'm just i'm
kind of bummed about this so I have one
more box opening to do and I'm going to
change my shirt so it looks like it's a
different day so it doesn't look
ridiculous but I have my boxy charm
still coming up someone across my
fingers and boxy charm is going to be
better so stay tuned for that in the
next few days but you would like to sign
