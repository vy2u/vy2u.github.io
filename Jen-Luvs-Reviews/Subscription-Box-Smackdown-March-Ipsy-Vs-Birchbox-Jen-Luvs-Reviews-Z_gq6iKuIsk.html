smackdown I am so excited to open my
boxes and my bag with a box in my bag I
got lots of good stuff in here including
something for you guys I ordered
something else for you from my Ipsy
points so I'm not gonna I'm just going
to start with FC this month I always
start to start with bars barks let me
start with MC because I know there's
something in here for you I kind of I
looked like openness and I kind of
peeked in the bag a little bit I have to
admit I peeked a little bit but I didn't
open up the actual epsy bag so i want to
show you this I got this for you guys
with my FC points it is a Knicks bronze
smoky look kit um I don't want I don't
know maybe i'll insert a picture this is
from the Ipsy website of what it looks
like inside this is actually sealed I
don't want to open it but this is for
somebody so if you would like to win the
bronze smoky look kit by NYX you're
going to put a comment down below that
you are interested in winning this and
then I will pick a winner within 24
hours of upload of this video and I will
notify you through your YouTube mail
please make sure you check your youtube
mail because when I gave away the
benefit hi Vivian last month the person
never check their mail and I have still
haven't heard from them so I'm actually
going to be giving away the benefit
high-beam again this month because I I
still have it and I need to give it to
somebody so we'll do this will do the
high beam and we'll see what else we
have to give away for whatever reason if
there's anything else to give away so
there's at least two things up for grabs
and I'm using random.org to choose the
winner anyway enough about that let's
see what's in the Ipsy bag so there is
something that's loose in here so I'm
going to pull that out first and this is
the pacifica Indian coconut nectar body
butter and I can smell it from here it
smells like straight-up suntan lotion
like coconutty suntan lotion which
smells good to me it's not an amazing
sent to me just because it's not you
know it smells like suntan lotion so I
love Pacifica products i actually have
an affiliate link down below that i
don't thing anybody's ever used but it's
down there because I do love Pacifica
products very strong scent so if you
don't like strong sense you're not going
to like this okay so there's that
not very oily actually the the the smell
actually smells a lot nicer now that I'm
putting it on it's less concentrated it
smells more like a like a pina colada
and less like suntan lotion now so I
actually like it better and there isn't
a strong greasiness to it there's
definitely a little bit but it's not
strong as far as the sly meanness of it
I definitely have much slimy your
lotions than that and it seeps in pretty
nice is actually already gone so very
happy with this formula and sent pretty
nice it's okay not my favorite but i
like it so we get our destination beauty
and if i live near cal in california i
would totally be going to destination
beauty but i am not spending hundreds of
dollars to go to destination beauty i'm
already spending hundred dollars i'm
actually going to be at New York imats
in April just I'm going on sunday i
couldn't get saturday tickets because i
slacked so my friend adrian and i are
going on sunday so if you're going to be
at New York I'm at please let me know in
the comments and maybe we can like fun
spots meet up or whatever you know very
excited about that but anyway
destination beauty is an event that if
she puts on every year they've done past
couple years and I would love to go one
day but not the sherry Reese's geography
based series Street anatomy from San
Francisco California that's cool so she
must have designed the bag it feels um
very thick it's very smooth plasticky
smooth bag I do like the print it's very
neat I'm not quite sure exactly what's
happening with it but I'm not sure
what's happening with a lot of arts oh I
don't hold that against it okay so first
thing I'm seeing is this card with a
little mini marvelous moxie bareminerals
exclusively for epsy free lash
domination tendon one volumizing mascara
sample plus free shipping on your bare
minerals purchase that's cool it's says
get ready I guess that's the name of the
shade it looks like it's gonna be a
shade that I like and it looks like a
lipstick yeah beautiful I will totally
rock that nice pigmentation let's see
how it it doesn't feel sticky it feels
carry smooth and it definitely shares
out a bit cool so definitely happy about
this I love bare minerals products i
love their lip products so super happy
to get that
yay wish it was a little bit bigger but
you know I can't complain as a
ten-dollar subscription service you know
I'm saying Nicole by OPI it says a gift
for you which i think is I always think
it's funny because I actually paid for
this bag if you purchase something it's
not a gift but they must be giving this
away for some other thing but this is
definitely not a gift for me and this is
ruffles ro ug H el es rules rules I
don't know how to think that that's not
a real word but that's okay you can make
up words because your company and
companies can make up words the shade is
on what grounds it's got some little
speckles in it some dark blue looks like
speckles maybe some brown speckles and
they're two very strange I wonder how
this will work the speckles are very
prominent in the formula you listed the
drip test very thick alright so I'm
calling this on a to coat polish so from
the thickness of it I would say it's a
to coat polish but from my experience
with no Nicole by OPI I've never tried
this rules ruffles thing but typically
they're three coat polishes so we shall
see about this anxious to try that the a
bombshell it looks like it's got four
colors on the back so this may be is an
eyeshadow quad says starlet Bora Bora
rock bottom and risky business I don't
own some single eyeshadows from them and
add some blushes that are this size but
this is an eyeshadow quad these aren't
colors that I typically wear but I will
definitely try them and see this looks
like more someone with the deeper skin
tone would probably really enjoy these
but we'll see let's watch them they feel
very soft I'm just gonna swatch them all
and then show you all at once ooh nice
pigmentation whoo very nice try not to
hit that that lipsticks wash so those
are the colors so there's the blue and
then the dark brown is over here and
then of course the orange and then the
bronze from bail very nice so overall I
love via bombshell product there's only
been one product that I did not like
from them and that was the Onyx eyeliner
pen
which a lot of people love I did not
like it because it seeped into my fine
lines and made my eyes look really funky
I've always loved their eyeshadows and
their blushes and things so very
thankful to have that one two three four
I guess that's it I guess only four
products this month but of course well
over ten dollars with a problem let's
just go ahead and move into birchbox I
like normal I don't have high hopes for
birchbox I never really do the one thing
I wanted to show you and thank you for
is that I did get the Smashbox full
exposure palette and I got this thanks
to some referrals from people signing up
using my link and also from reviews that
I've done the Birchbox bonus point
system is really the reason to sign up
for Birchbox if you end up using the
points towards products then it ends up
only costing really five bucks a box I
wasn't planning on buying it but when I
saw that I could get it with my Birchbox
points I went ahead and got it and I am
absolutely puff with this thing I will
be doing a review of this eventually but
not today so we'll hold off on that
subscribe so you don't miss that did
want to mention that because I did get
it with my birchbox points and I want to
thank those of you they have used my
referral link down below because thanks
to you I was able to get that anyway
let's move on to what's in the Birchbox
also ten bucks a month okay little
pretty little card spring forward so I'm
not going to look at the products on the
back and then this is what is inside and
so the first thing I'm seeing is a
Jergens BB body perfecting skin cream BB
body I know BB cream for face by don't
know BB body and it says all light skin
tones okay it instantly visibly improves
skin and gradually perfect skin over
five days what does it do though it
hydrates illuminates evens firms and
corrects you got put on my thighs I
don't really want to illuminate my
thighs but I definitely want to firm and
correct I don't know I don't really know
what am I correcting with this okay it's
a little tinted so it doesn't look like
it's got a pigmentation to it I don't
know that's weird um so I understand
hydrates I understand illuminates even
what are you what is it evening and I
understand firms but what is it
correcting like I don't I don't get it I
don't get it off to play with it and try
it and see because right now I'm a
little not sure about that thing okay
supergoop anti-aging UV damage repair
complex City sunscreen serum I actually
really love even though I don't like the
name supergoop because it makes it I
just doesn't sound appealing to me I
really liked their products I tried
there i think was there BB cream i got a
sample of and i loved it it was awesome
or was a CC cream maybe but oh my gosh
is amazing so happy to have anything by
supergoop okay next I'm seeing ooh
makeup in birchbox yeah okay Anika i get
i got an eyeliner gel eyeliner from them
once and it's right out pretty quickly
but while it was was well it was jelly
I'm not jelly but you know I'm saying
while it was working it worked really
well but it dried out on me and it's in
green lagoon I'm always up for a new
green liner cool oops wait what you have
a clear cap but you also have this black
caps I guess you made me throw that this
one away and then put this one on feels
good seems like a good idea to me um
yeah but it flies off so it's like you
know not that I typically shake my
eyeliners but you know I just like my
caps to stay on you know all right let's
see can you guys see that so it's kind
of a light green I don't have anything
like this very thankful to have that so
excited about this I think I'll probably
end up using this as a lower lashline
kind of thing because it is a little
light for upper lash line if I do use an
upper lash line I may make it like a
thicker line and then put some black a
very thin black line right by my lash
line so that it doesn't um you know to
give it a little more of a base to it so
it doesn't look creepy but I you know
I'm excited to have this especially for
birchbox we will usually get stuff like
this from birchbox that's really cool
and it's organic that's really cool an
envelope stuck to stuff will hold off on
that one for a second this is called
curl keeper total control for frizzy
hair curly hair solutions now I don't
have curly hair I've wavy hair but i'll
try this anyway dryness causes
frizziness and out-of-control hair curl
keeper enables you to become the master
of gorgeous frizz-free curls
so we'll try this I don't know how it's
going to affect my hair but we'll
definitely try it you're supposed to
come in through wet hair allow your hair
to dry without touching until curl
keeper starts to work how do I know it's
working to add volume bounce and
movement hang your head over Paul
bending forward to dry the roots to
resell here activate with water okay I'm
gonna have to play with that because I
can just imagine me like with my head
upside down waiting for this stuff to
activate and just wondering when it's
going to activate and I don't know
that's a little confusing to me but
that's okay we're gonna try it we're
gonna see how it goes alright and then
it looks like last thing oh it looks
like that Jergens was a Birchbox fine
because there's a coupon in here for two
dollars off any Jergens products that's
kind of cool that was just like an extra
bonus they threw in there and then this
is called Juliet has a gun did anybody
at remember um Julie brown it's back in
like the late 80s she had a song called
homecoming Queens got a gun if you don't
know look it up on youtube it's the most
disturbing song ever and when I was a
kid I loved the song I don't know why i
remember roller skating in my basement
going back and forth singing this jewel
homecoming Queens got a gun song but
anyway totally off topic this is
Juliette has a gun and this is called
not a perfume that's so funny to me look
I don't know like it's a perfume but
it's called not a perfume and it even
says o de parfum on there let's smell
this you Juliet not a perfume perfume
who I just took my eyeballs in it that
probably wasn't the idea it smells very
floral I have lotion on my hands so it's
kind of messing with me and almost like
a doctor's office I'm gonna spray it on
the card see if that helps it like
seriously smells like you know flowers
and doctors office oh that's terrible
that's I'm so sorry if you're from this
company but that is a horrible smell oh
that smells awful oh I'm getting like
flashbacks from getting shots you know I
like to send you guys stuff but this
isn't worth sending to anybody it smells
horrible oh gosh I'm now I got to smell
that in this room for
Ron keep filming I like honestly like
I'm pretty open with perfumes I like a
lot of different types of sense but
that's just horrible so let's go ahead
and just do a little summary of what i
got in ypsi we got the Pacific full-size
Pacifica Indian coconut yeah Indian
coconut nectar body butter and we got
the quad of the Z look it's stuck we got
the view bump ah we got the via
bombshell eyeshadow quad we got the
little mini marvelous Moxie lipstick and
get ready very wearable shade for me
love it and then the Nicole by OPI nail
polish in on what grounds and also of
course the little epsy cosmetic bag and
Birchbox we got the curl keeper total
control for hair frizzy hair hair
solution stuff we got the supergoop city
sunscreen serum we got the Jergens BB
body in as a the Birchbox bonus we got
the Anika green eyeliner and then we got
the not a perfume sure as well not a
perfume perfume by Juliette has a
handgun maybe I'll bring this to my next
doctor's visit and they can spray it so
the doctor's office smells a little more
like a doctor's office in case they
start making it smell a little more like
a typical place of business overall I
feel like once again I am personally
happier with my Ipsy but I'm i am
excited about some of these things from
birchbox I'm really excited about the
eyeliner really happy to have this
supergoop anxious to try this not sure
about this and really don't like this at
all so i mean i don't know i would say
birchbox is a 3 out of 5 epsy four out
of five and yeah just that's that's the
way it went in March I would love to
