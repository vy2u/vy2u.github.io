hello my friends welcome to my summer
essentials video this is a collab with
my friend cat over at carrying cosmetics
33 she is awesome and amazing if you
like cruelty free products and all
natural products and DIYs and fashion
and all those kinds of things you will
absolutely love cat I'm gonna put a
picture of cat right there I mean
amazing thumbnails you can just tell
it's gonna be amazing because it's an
amazing thumbnail no she really does
have a fantastic channel you know she's
one of those hidden gems on YouTube that
people don't really well let's just say
people haven't really discovered the
amazingness that is cat and I strongly
suggest you go over there and discover
her because I think that she will really
really love her videos so cat is going
to be doing her summer essentials for
you and I am going to be doing mine you
are here for the first time a coming
over from cash channel hi I'm Jen it's
so nice to meet you i hope you enjoy my
video and here it comes hello product
first some are essential of course we
know in the summertime we need to make
sure we take care of our skin we know
that skin being out in the Sun causes
aging our skin age faster more
importantly it called can cause skin
cancer so very very important to protect
our skin now I'm not going to give you a
Sun screen everybody knows that a good
sunscreen is essential but I feel like
that's kind of like a no-brainer you
know I'm saying so I want to give you
some essentials for sunscreen that I use
that you may not know about first thing
is BB and CC cream just give you my
favorites and of course these have SPF
in them so they do provide a level of
protection these are both SPF 20 so if
that's not enough for you you want to
put on a sunscreen underneath so let me
just start with the BB cream this is the
Garnier BB cream this is the skin renew
miracle Perfector I use a light medium
this is an amazing BB cream it goes on
very very smoothly less all day amazing
this one is kind of a light to medium
coverage where this one is more of a
medium to full coverage this is the
limine time for ECC anti-aging color
correcting cream I use medium and both
of these are just fantastic products
they're both SPF 20 if you want to
conclude
SPF in your skincare now just so you
know if you're going to a wedding or if
you're going to be in a wedding be
careful of that SPF in your face
products because it will make your face
kind of wash out in photos but yeah so
these these are definitely essentials
for me there I like this one better for
summer personally just because it's a
little more lightweight but if I want a
little more full coverage I will use
this one and I do not have a high end BB
cream that I feel like is as good as
these so why bother recommending it you
know I'm saying alright moving on don't
dunk it on let's keep going on with the
SPF know everybody knows the matte lip
thing is huge matte lips are just
everywhere but matte lips can be very
very drying so what I like to do is
underneath the matte lip if I want to
keep that Matt look underneath the matte
lip I will put a SPF lip balm if I want
to los it up a little bit i can put
these over top and it will give me a
little bit of gloss on top of that matte
lip so these are ones that i have SPF in
them the sugar rose is the high-end one
that i have any of the sugar lip balms
they're amazing very very moisturizing
this has SPF 15 I believe all of these
are SPF 15 this one is called real it's
a natural lip balm this is the spearmint
flavor the number one ingredient and
this is a low which is very very nice if
you've been out in the Sun and you you
know for whatever reason forgot your
sunscreen this is a low of course is
very good for after sun care this one
here is the Donald lips a ver I got this
in a subscription box and I love this
this is SPF 15 again and be number one
ingredients in this is I don't new this
one does not have the ingredients on the
tube if I can find them online I will
link them in the description down below
but this is also a really really nice
one and then this one here this is the
surface Sun systems ignition lip on this
one actually belongs my husband but I
steal it all the time this one is
peppermint and menthol I don't know if
you like that mentholated feeling but if
you do this is a really really good when
this one is SPF 15 as well and again
this one does not have the ingredients I
will list those down below for you the
top ingredients so you know what they're
made of but these are my favorites right
now SPF containing lip balms they are
some all right keep it on with the skin
up products these are by josie maran
these are the whipped argan oil
aluminized body butters these things are
awesome if you already have a medium
skin tone or a deeper skin tone you will
absolutely love these anybody really can
use these but it gives you a little bit
of shimmer on your body but it's not
sparkle you know I'm San so you can see
it's got a little bit of a tint to it
but it doesn't like the tint isn't like
a real tints like it's a it's more of a
moisturizer and then when you put it on
let me kind of see if I can show you my
arms don't have anything on them but
then when I put this on again not
sparkly because girlfriend I am NOT
trying to be glitter okay I'm not trying
to look like I was attacked by a pixie
alright this just gives my skin just a
really nice glow I don't know if that's
showing up on camera it doesn't look
like it is when I'm looking in the
camera it doesn't look like it's showing
up but i'm telling you girlfriend it is
absolutely beautiful and also has a
really nice scent to it this one here
that i just opened is the soft pink
radiance vanilla and fig scent and it's
not an overpowering scent it's just very
very mild but it's really really nice
it's a nice nice product this one here
is the white gold radiance with a
vanilla scent and then this one here is
the golden golden opal radiance with a
vanilla peach scent and they're all
fantastic so highly recommend these
these do not have any kind of SPF in
them so just be aware you're going to
want to put your sunscreen on before you
use this alright moving on to the face
we've got some bronzers here of course
if you are my skin tone or lighter maybe
a little bit deeper than me we all love
our bronzer so here are a couple of them
this one is kind of an illuminating
bronzer this is the CC plus radiance
hombre bronzer that's the one I'm
wearing today I have a little bit of
blush on over top but I don't have any
highlighter my highlighter all comes
from this this isn't over spray here so
the more you use it the more it fades
but up here it's pretty densely packed
into the product but it what did go down
a little bit further but since I've used
the product it's kind of faded from
there but this is just an absolutely
beautiful bronzer it does have warmth to
it you don't want to contour with this
but it is it's a very long wearing
beautiful bronzer it really blends
nicely into the skin has a very long
lasting power and I
really really enjoyed this bronzer I got
this last summer and I am still loving
it one year later the other one that I
have for you is the cargo bronzer this
one is more of a natural bronzer there's
just a tad tad bit of a sheen to it but
it's not obnoxious it's not a glittery
where the other one is more like an
illuminating glittering a glittery but
illuminating like shimmery kind of look
where this one is more of like a very
soft satin not mad just the very soft
satin but I really really like this one
a lot this one I feel like lasts even
longer than the eight cosmetics this one
has a ridiculous last time like I don't
care if I put this thing on first thing
in the morning I'm sweating all day long
I will still see this at the end of a
this is like a hardcore all day long
bronzer it is awesome so definitely
recommend this cargo bronzer and again
my shade that I have it in is medium it
is okay and then moving on oh I meant to
mention this when we were talking about
skincare now laughs for the past few
years i have been using the two-faced
cream i guess it was like a lotion II
kind of Sun sunless tanner and I've
absolutely loved and unfortunately to
face does not make it any more i can
still get it on Amazon some but I just
haven't so I decided to kind of branch
out and do something else and I have
been trying the st. Tropez products now
don't hate on me for this and I'm
bringing this up because this is what
i've been using I'm a huge fan of
self-tanning and I don't have one that I
can show you that you can still get
easily so I'm just bringing this out
just as an example and give you a review
of it these are really nice but they are
extremely extremely extremely gradual
tan products this one is the gradual tan
yes anti-aging multi-action face st.
Tropez face bronzer thing definitely
very slow like it will take me three or
four days in a row to even see anything
happening on my face for this this is
the one for the body this is a bronzing
spray self tan bronzing spray this one
again also very very very gradual now
one thing I have to tell you I have
extremely small bathroom like you open
I'll give one bathroom on our house you
open the door you step forward you're at
the toilet step forward again you're at
the bathtub step forward again that
you're at the sink and it's like this
little tiny area also the fan
broke in my bathroom so all we have is a
window so I open the window and if there
is not a strong breeze that I this is I
feel like I'm asphyxiating myself using
this I mean it has a very strong smell
and it is it fills up the room with
spray so if you do not have a
well-ventilated area please do not get
this I am trying to use up I will not be
repurchasing this be just because I
don't think a bronzing spray is good for
me in my personal situation I don't like
the fact that I inhale it it freaks me
out so I won't be Reaper siddhis and
that was my fault like just not thinking
about that you know I would be inhaling
as i used it i was trying to just get
something easy that I wouldn't get all
over my hands but I don't like this
product and it's not the products fault
it's it's my fault for getting a product
that does not meet my personal situation
as far as where i can use this product
and again it is extremely gradual so
you're gonna have to use this every day
for like three or four days in order to
see anything and even then it doesn't
get super dark so if you're looking for
something really dark i would not
recommend this and i would not recommend
this if you do not have a
well-ventilated area to use it in self
tanning is an essential is a summer
essential for me personally some people
embrace their lighter skin personally i
like to have a glow that was a way i was
raised was to go out in the sun and
lather yourself up with some oil you
know like you gotta get that glow on my
grandmother would pick on me in the
summertime if i was too pale I so you
know that's just my culture selling my
culture I like to be tan I like to look
bronzed in the summer and so I think
self tanning for me personally isn't
essential next up for summer we're going
to go into a little bit of makeup we're
going to go into eyes and lips bright
eyes and bright lips are just amazing
for summer I they just show that
vibrancy in that light that the Sun you
know brings us we get really excited
about things being bright and energetic
in the summertime so a bright energetic
I or or a bright energetic lip can
really brighten up your face and really
bring some awesome light to it so I do
not recommend pairing a bright eye and a
bright lip it just can get a little bit
too overwhelming but one or the other
slip stir with eyes these are really
truly my favorite bright eyeshadow
palettes now this
is the one I'm wearing today this is the
brand new elf party-ready palette and I
will show you what that looks like and
well I am going to be doing a review of
all four of the elf palettes the contour
palette the bronzer palette and then the
color-changing lip product once I've
tried everything but i did use this
today and i want to give you some first
impressions on this this is not as
bright as you would expect it i am
wearing it on my eyes today I'm just
going to kind of close my eyes a bit so
this is kind of what i have on my i
Sedan you notice that it's not extremely
bright these are these are very very
easy to blend but don't expect them to
be like this one here okay they're not
super bright which is really nice for
people that are trying to get used to
some color but what I did today was I
did this all over the lid I did this
from the inner half all the way to the
inner corner this is in the center of my
lid blend it out to the outer corner
then i have this blended up into the
crease and then i have this to deepen up
the crease here and then on my lower
lash line i put this on the outer corner
this in the middle and then a little bit
of this blend it up in from the middle
into the inner corner and i found it
very very easy to work with again and
not as bright as you would expect so be
aware of that but it is a really nice
palette very easy to use along the same
price line because that's ten dollars i
believe this is 12 on the bhcosmetics
website this is the galaxy chic palette
or galaxy chick however you want to call
it and this is a phenomenal bright
colors palettes extremely pigmented i
mean that's just it's insane it's
absolutely insane I mean look at these
like that and then you look at these I
mean you can see these over here are
just a little more subdued where these
are a little brighter so it's really
what your personal preference is and
what your taste is if you're looking for
something super bright I would
definitely recommend this one the
lasting power is fantastic the blend
ability is fantastic I would compare
this to my high-end shadows as far as
quality and usability and all of that I
mean it is fantastic palette highly
highly highly highly highly recommend
this for bright colors for the more
expensive palettes these two are my
favorites for bright colors this one
here is the one that's a little more
subtle this
the Too Faced sugarpop palette this one
is so fun to play with so easy so creamy
so buttery show everything I ever want
in a bright palette you've got these
beautiful colors down here you've got
some blending colors out here this is
beautiful for many many many skin tones
you've got these deeper shades if you're
a deeper skin tone medium to light
you're going to have a plenty of things
to balance it out it's just a beautiful
beautiful palette and I love love love
this for people that want super bright
and higher end of course the Urban Decay
electric palette is amazing I mean
you're looking at and that's just it's
crazy it's absolutely crazy the electric
pneus and they come off just like that
so well I mean just are you kidding me
are you kidding me like what I mean
they're neon their neon colored neon
yawn yawn yawn and then I'll compare
that here to the galaxy chic let's say
okay let's see if I can ok so my pinky
haha this was not very planned out you
can see this my pinky and my thumb are
from the from the BH Cosmetics and then
my three in the middle are from the
Urban Decay and you can see they're just
all extremely extremely bright all
extremely high quality you're not going
to get with this the neon see how
they're they're very very neon here
these colors and neon colors are not
going to be in here except for this neon
orange you could probably pull that all
for this one here but for the most part
these are a little more wearable than
the neons than the electric palette so
it's really really what you're looking
for in a palette and which one calls to
you alright moving on to lips you know
the matte lip trend is huge right now
but there are also some really good not
matte lipsticks that are also awesome
the Urban Decay revolution lipsticks are
phenomenal this one here is the one that
I'm wearing today this one is called
catfight it's awesome and again it's on
my lips today but you can see the
pigmentation is just ridiculous it's
ridiculous if you are looking for a
high-end lipstick I would definitely
recommend these for bright colors the
only thing is is they don't say
moisturizing for very long so I do pair
them with one of the lip balms to make
sure
I lip stay hydrated because I do feel
like these can be a bit drawing as far
as the drugstore and these next soft
matte lip creams are amazing I really
really like this shade this one I
believe is in Antwerp yes I love this
love this love this again extremely
extremely bright and awesome and this
these I feel like I've been a little
less drawing than the Urban Decay
believe it or not they feel good they
feel very satiny on the lips they don't
dry my lips out but if you're very very
sensitive to lips drying out and you
like to feel constant moisture ization I
definitely recommend using a lip balm
with both of these alright so those are
my summer essentials for summer of 2015
