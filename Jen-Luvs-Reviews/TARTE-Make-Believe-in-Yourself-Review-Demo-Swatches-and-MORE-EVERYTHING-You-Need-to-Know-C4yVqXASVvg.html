the chart make believe in yourself
palettes I got some things I believe in
and some things I don't believe in and I
am looking forward to sharing those
thoughts with you this is the tarte make
believe in your self palette it is
limited edition from tarts you can get
this on tarte calm you can get it
sephora calm you can get it at Ulta calm
I'm not sure if they're selling it in
stores but I would imagine that they are
those the only places I personally know
you can get it but when you're watching
this there may be other places if you do
know of another place you can get this
palette definitely leave it in the
comments below and I'll add it to the
video description before we get started
with this review I do want to thank the
people that purchased this palette I
have been doing super chats in my weekly
chats and people have chosen of their
own free will to donate toward the
channel so the people whose names are
scrolling today are the one to purchase
this I had bought beachy face natural
love College even though I decided I
wasn't going to buy it I decided to buy
it and then this collection came out and
I was like and then I was like oh yeah I
could use the money from the super chat
so that is why this video exists so I
want to thank them so much for the
donation so that I could review this for
you if you've never been to one of my
review videos before they are very long
they have lots of information for people
that want a lot of different information
so I want to provide for as many people
as possible but that means that you may
not be interested in this entire video
so that's why I put skip ahead buttons
down in the description so there's
timestamps you just need to click on
those timestamps in order to get exactly
where you want to go so if you're not
interested in the swatches you can skip
ahead to the next section
so in this palette you get ten eyes
shadows and one highlighter in the
center each one of these eye shadows is
1.1 grams of product the highlighter in
the center is three grams of product
things you need to know about tart as a
brand tart does say that they are
cruelty free and they are certified
cruelty free by PETA toward statement on
their website says that Tarte cosmetics
is a cruelty-free cosmetics line chart
makeup and skincare is never tested on
animals there's something you need to
know if you are a cruelty-free consumer
is that into
thousand 14 chart was bought by a
company called codes they also own
Rimmel London and toes is not a
cruelty-free company they are a Japanese
based company when Tarte was bought by
codes they did put a statement on their
Facebook because there was concern about
their cruelty-free status and this is
what they said we are a cruelty-free
company and will remain one code is
completely on board with our position as
an eco-friendly cruelty-free company and
it's given charts such a great
opportunity to grow and expand around
the world so depending on your level of
cruelty-free you may say that they are
you may say that they aren't PETA says
that they are but their parent company
is not so it's up to you whether you
consider them to be cruelty-free or not
in the description of this palette it
says it's formulated without parabens
mineral oil sale 8 sodium lauryl sulfate
and gluten but this is not vegan there
is Carmine in some of the shadows
carmine is made from crushed beetles and
it's funny because I've been getting
some comments lately when we talk about
Parra mine in cruelty-free brand
well isn't crushing beetles like against
animals but that's not what cruelty free
means cruelty free means that it's not
tested on onion animals it doesn't mean
that there aren't cruel things happening
to things like bugs in order to make it
so if you are anti the crushing of bugs
and you do not want to buy this
eyeshadow pallete last thing I want to
know about tarte is that their products
are made in the USA so now let's talk
about value a bit so as I mentioned
before the eyeshadows the 10 of them are
1.1 grams which we invented being 11
grams total and eyeshadow then you have
your 3 gram highlighter in the center
that leaves us a 14 grams total of
product it is a $40 product so that
gives us two dollars and 86 cents per
gram which is a little bit more
expensive for a Tarte product but not
much Tarte is one of the least expensive
eyeshadow brands in that kind of realm
there'll eat less expensive than Urban
Decay they're way less expensive than
honest alia they're less expensive than
lorac they're about the same as Too
Faced as far as price per gram when you
compare it to the Tarte tartlet palette
and the tardis pro palette this one is
the most expensive per gram but not by a
whole lot with the tartlet coming in at
2.56
Graham and the tortoise probe coming in
at two dollars and sixty-five cents a
gram the packaging for this it is a
metal packaging and it has a clasp
closure it's not a magnetic closure at
the clasp closure it has a circular
mirror inside and fingerprints left on
this relatively easily dust gets
everywhere but it is very very easy to
clean off if you do want to clean it all
so now we are going to go ahead and get
into the swatches we're going to do both
brush swatches and finger swatches we'll
go ahead and get into those right now
welcome my friend to the swatches so
you're going to open it up with this
clasp closure and inside there are your
ten eyes shadows and your one
highlighter in the center go ahead and
swatch the first four kind of brownish
tone shade and the first one is called
crystal and that one actually when it's
washes has a little bit of a pink shift
to it pixie is a little more of a true
pink and then miss a you are matte brown
shade it can be used for transition for
some people and then magic now this is
the makeup geek foiled blush I've got
some critiques on the brush that I use
and I wanted to make sure I use the
brush specifically met for foiled spike
style eyeshadows so as you can see these
are very light on my skin tone
except for that last one magic is a
little bit deeper close-up of the
swatches shows that pinkish purple shift
in Crystal and the more true print pink
pixie you seem it doesn't look super
pigmented but it does make for a nice
transition color for a lot of skin tones
not for everybody and then magic is
really gorgeous here's the white test
this is supposed to simulate what
happens through their timer if you rub
your eyes things like that and as you
can see myth and magic are the only ones
that are really still around going into
the second four we have wings Marvel
trance and fairy wings is gorgeous I
really love wings Marvel also performs
very very well trance I haven't used as
much to be honest with you and fairy is
the one that I want to love but keeps
disappointing me so wings swatches okay
it's pretty good you can work with it
it's nice I really do love Marvel I wish
I'd use Marvel in the tutorial because
is really really beautiful especially as
an inner corner highlight trance I
haven't used trance
I'm Florian I haven't used it but it's
watches okay mmm it just doesn't call to
me as much as the other shades and fairy
I keep trying with fairy I keep trying
because I want to love it but it kind of
Gray's out on the eye here are the
up-close swatches and you can see that
wings has a little bit less of a shine
than some of the other shade
now there's the white test you can see
that this four set of four hanging
around a lot better than the first set
probably just due to their natural
deepness but then when you look at
Marvel Marvel still around and that's a
pretty light shade you can see clearly
here by pointer finger has a mystic and
my middle finger has dream on it and
it's interesting that in the swatches in
the video sorry for the blur right there
and the swatches of the video it seems
like that mystic is a little bit more
mermaid looking where dream is a little
frosty err where in person I feel like
it's the opposite it's very strange I
had to go back and watch a few times
just to make sure I gotten it right but
as you can see there really isn't a
whole lot of difference between two
shades which makes me sad because I feel
like they could have given us a deeper
blue for dream and they look quite
different in the pan they just aren't
show them up differently on the skin
it's the same on the eyes as it is on
the arm now with the right test you can
see they both stick around actually
pretty well so it's really just that
first this first three crystal pixie of
myths don't stick around for that now
let's check out the highlighter sorry
again for the blurriness it's going to
come back in a second I'm using a
highlighter brush there and I wanted to
show you how it would apply using a
brush as well and you can see it just
kind of gives a subtle shift it's just a
subtle shine you'd see it better on my
cheeks in the tutorial percent portion
but it is you can definitely see that
shine and you can see the iridescent now
with the white test you can see it's
gone there's no eyelet left lasting
power on this highlight is just not good
now that you see the swatches let's go
ahead and get into ingredient analysis
so the first thing you need to know is
that about half this palette is not lips
safe actually a little more than half
the palate the ingredients in here that
are not lips safe are pro Miam hydroxide
greens homing chromium not home iam
chromium chromium chromium oxide greens
ferric ferrocyanide in ultramarine
I cannot guarantee that the for that I'm
going to show you our lips safe but they
are definitely not not lipsticks so
we've got marble which is this greenish
one here this brick looking one called
wings and then these two down here which
are called crystal and pixie the rest of
them
have ingredients that are not allowed to
be in lip products according to the FDA
there are two ingredients in here that
are irritation concerns for some people
the first one is glyceryl been innate
the hemming and then the last one is the
phenoxyethanol which is in every single
eyeshadow palette that I've ever
reviewed on this channel and diamond
ingredient analysis it was a replacement
for parabens when people started
freaking out over parabens and didn't
want paraben so now pronounce the
ethanol's and everything and that one is
an irritation concern for some people
but I've been led to believe through my
research that it's less people than that
are allergic to parabens calc is also an
ingredient in every single one of these
shadows and sorbic acid is in only two
of the shadows and that is an allergen
for some people one thing I do want to
mention is this does have the same
vanilla scent as some other tart
eyeshadow palettes I forgot to mention
that but it does so if you like that
vanilla scent that is in here if you
don't like it it's in here but other
than that we're good for ingredients as
far as my research goes we've got a lot
of information so now I want to show you
how these products perform on the eyes
the struggle was real today into this
eyeshadow palette I actually did started
a look hated it took it off started
another look hated it took it off and
then finally ended up with the look that
I have today and I'm not going to edit
that completely out because I want you
to see the struggle I want you to see me
as it makes enthusiasts not a makeup
artist and what I went through to try to
get a good look out of this palette
maybe it's just me and the choices that
I don't know how to make apparently or
I'll tell you more about my thoughts
after the demo so just go ahead and
watch and then we'll discuss alright
y'all ready for attempt one this is the
Ulta eyeprimer it replaced the Urban
Decay Eden in my life it is my current
favorite eye primer just because it's
cheaper than Eden doesn't cover quite as
well as Eden but it's still good as I
mentioned earlier that just palette
definitely needs some match to go with
it so I broke into the tardis Pro
palette I do select the lid shape was
way too dark that I use it's been a
while since I've used that palette so
when I threw on the transition shade it
didn't cool
each work as well as I had hoped now
going into this light blue shade it
takes a bit to pack on I am using a
makeup geek foiled brush there and then
I start layering on the darker blue
shade and I notice right away that the
contrast between those two shades mystic
and dream just really you can't see it
it's kind of crazy so those are the two
fingers swatches next to each other
finger swatches you can tell the
difference but on the eye he just can't
now I try to go into fairy which is the
purple and it just it's not necessarily
lighter than the other two but it's just
not working there's no there isn't
enough tone contrast there so we go
ahead and put the primer back on let's
try again with the lid shade this time I
went a little lighter on the lid but
still probably not light enough going
into the transition shade which is
called myth you can see there still
isn't enough contrast between the lid
and the crease so if you're going to use
myth as a transition shade you
definitely want to make sure that your
lid shade contrasts with it which it
does not here I get it on the third try
though so I'm going to try trance in the
inner corner as kind of an inner corner
highlight I don't know what I was
thinking
totally didn't work figured I try the
purple again in the on the lid and still
not super poppy not as poppy as I hoped
it would be trying to deepen up the
outer corner with magic because the
purple didn't work as an outer corner
but as you can see it's still not dark
outer corners in my look that I like to
do are dark so that did not work so
let's go ahead and try number three back
in with the Ulta eye primer again and
I'm noticing that I have a ton of
fallout on my cheeks from the two
previous applications so you definitely
want to do your concealer and your
foundation after you use this palette
it's just difficult to keep the Follette
away I finally nailed the lid color from
the gorgeous Perl palette yeah you can
see how this definitely contrasts with
that which is what I was going for in
the coarse place so I'm abandoning the
purple color for now we've got pixie all
over the lid you see it is just
not showing up it's not as shimmery as
it is in the swatch it's not as
beautiful as it is in this watch it's
just not going on so we go back to good
ol reliable purple because I do love
purple so much but it's just
pixie just can't keep up with fairy the
purple it just can't it's not working so
I'm trying to go back and forth but it's
not working so we'll go ahead and try a
little bit of magic up in the crease and
it is a little bit darker up in the
crease but again not a big contrast
going down I figure well let's try some
fingertip application of fairy and of
pixie to see if that helps and I'll tell
you it does help a little bit and now
I'm just trying to blend those two
together get some kind of gradation and
that says nothing else seems to be light
enough we're going to go for the
highlighter shade in the middle which is
called believe and I still honestly
don't really like this so we're going to
try to brighten up the inner corner a
little more with Marvel which I had
success with in the past still not
really great going in back into the
tardis Pro palette trying to deepen up
the look just a little bit just to add
some kind of complexity to it because a
look is completely falling flat going
back in with the purple and with the
pink trying to make sure that my crease
color doesn't overlap over top of my lid
color because I do want my lid to pop
now back in for that brow bone highlight
last dip in to try to blend all of this
together oh no one more dip we got to go
into the lower lash line so again very
the purple down in the outer corner and
we're going to do believe which is a
highlight in the inner core it does
Center to the inner corner
so now this is the look with lashes and
liner I'm still really really really not
happy with the way this look came out it
is not poppy enough it is not what I
expected so now I just want to show you
how I tackle that fall out when I don't
think I'm going to have fall out and
then I do so I'm taking the Tarte shape
and just blending that in with the
Buddha prismatic brush and just kind of
trying to wipe away some of that glitter
and it does kind of cover it up which is
nice and now I'm just setting it with
some Tarte setting powder and it worked
out really well covering up the fallout
I feel it didn't get rid of it
completely but if you're in a pinch it
works again really not a fan of this eye
look but we're going to go with it
because they don't want to do it a
fourth time going in with the
highlighter I really do like this
highlighter as far as the initial look
of it it doesn't have a long lasting
power but initially I think it's very
pretty it's not super glowy
but it's glowy enough to give that skin
that kind of lit-from-within kind of
look so that's what that's what happened
in the application today it was not a
smooth process okay the first time I use
this eyeshadow palette I use this shade
right here this one is in the shade
Marvel this one I use on my inner corner
and it crease pretty bad I did do a
Instagram story on it but I didn't see
the Instagram story so I don't have
evidence of it but if you follow me on
Instagram you hopefully saw that I use
that in the inner corner and then I
believe if I remember right I used the
purple shade all over the lid I can't
remember exactly the shades I used but I
remember that this shade in particular
creased on me
but I really felt like the look came out
really beautiful I did do kind of a wear
test on it on the Instagram story in it
and they kind of mush together over the
day but it wasn't terrible it wasn't bad
it was just kind of okay I used this one
other time before this video and I
stopped to more of the neutrally looking
shades and I felt like the look came out
nice I did have some trouble getting
separation of color and I think that's
the big problem with this palette is the
separation of color there's a lot of
light
to midtown shades and not a lot of
darker shades like this one appears to
be dark but it's not when you put it on
the eye so you really need to think
about this as a supplemental palette I
tart themselves on their website tell
you to put on a nude colored base before
you put on the palette and that's why I
kept doing that in the video is because
tart says you're supposed to do that so
that's what I did so I feel like this is
a great companion palette to the tardis
Pro or some other palette that has a lot
of neutrals in it because what you can
do is you can use the neutrals and then
use one let me pick that use one of
these shadows to make it pop you may be
able to use two if you're talented maybe
you can get more than two to work but me
personally like I feel like I can't use
more than one of these shimmery shadows
together earl's it looks like a hot mess
it just looks bad they just don't like
blend into each other well there's no
gradiation there's no there's it just
they have trouble and I think that a lot
of that has to do with it they're just
all kind of the same level of lightness
when I put out on social media that I
purchased this palette I was asked a lot
whether it was the same formula as the
ones the shimmery ones that are in the
tardis Pro these guys right here I was
asked if it was the same formula because
when I reviewed this which I will link
below I talked about how much I love dis
formula and I will tell you that it is
not the same formula and I am what
disappointed because I really really
liked that I did an entire breakdown
show you what I did so right here here's
my checkmark so I listed all the
ingredients my printer was running out
of ink so that's the first page so these
are all the shades in the make believe
in yourself towel and then these are the
tardis Pro palette if you can see all of
the ingredients you would see that there
are a lot of added ingredients that are
in these that are not in the shimmery
shadows in the tardis Pro one of those
added ingredients is in ingredients
they've also added me honest Tavia
moderate renaissance palette which is
corn starch that is not in the tardis
Pro it's not in any of the other tark
shadows and one another thing that's in
here that's also in I believe in the
Anasazi is boron nitride now I don't
know
how all these things all work together
to make good eyeshadow but I'm just
saying that those ingredients are here
they're not in here in the shimmery
shadows so that may be making a
difference as far as how they perform
now as far as the highlight goes it does
come off very very white so if you are
of a deeper skin tone this may look a
little too white on your cheeks I don't
know though because I don't have a
deeper skin tone so I don't know I would
definitely look for reviews and swatches
on someone of a deeper skin tone but
because it is so white that's what it
leads me to believe it's like a white
iridescent lasting power on it is okay
lasted about five hours on the cheek
before it was completely gone so that's
going to who will feel the Bulldog if
you really like shine and you don't like
a lot of colors there are some more
natural looking colors in here it's with
the shine in them so there are some
options for some more wearable look the
shine doesn't come off as shiny on the
eyes as I thought it would so look for
the violet Voss holy grail pout let me
swatch toffee for you
it just feels creamier where this one
feels chunkier let's put it next to
wings those are not even close to the
same shade but that's the closest I can
get same thing with the color rain Queen
of Hearts
palette like let's do your majesty this
one's really chunky in comparison and
you can just see the intensity just
isn't as much as those two I know again
I know they're at dude so I'm just
trying to show you the formula
difference it's just not quite as
intense okay and then swatching next to
ethereal from the torque Pro palette I'm
going to put that right next to it it's
still more intense so
so final thoughts on this who is this
eyeshadow palette for it's for people
that really like poppy eyeshadows but
don't need them to be insanely intense
if you're a pro you might be able to get
it to work better than I did I had a lot
of trouble with getting more than two
shadows to work in a look but maybe you
can do better than I can
I wouldn't recommend this for beginners
and it is fun to play with it's not a
not recommend it's just I'm a little
disappointed and then I wanted it to be
perfect and it's not perfect I wanted
the shadows to be able to play better
together like when I think of like Kat
Von D eyeshadows how they play so nicely
together and you know the the indie
brands in the Julius place and color
drains of the world the makeup geek
eyeshadows I mean those place so nicely
together and it's just a disappointment
when tarts are shadows don't blend as
nicely into each other so for me I'm
happy to have it because I think it will
be fun to play with every once in a
while they do say that you can use these
as eyeliners as well I haven't
personally tried that but I think
that'll be a lot of fun so I am going to
keep it but it's not an enthusiastic
keep it's not an enthusiastic recommend
it's just a recommend for certain people
and if this calls to you again
not a bad palette if it doesn't call to
you don't feel bad about passing on it
so that's my review of the Tarte make
believe in yourself palette I hope you
enjoyed it if you did definitely make
sure you hit the subscribe button for
future videos I appreciate you being
here so much mad love and I'll see you
in a video soon
