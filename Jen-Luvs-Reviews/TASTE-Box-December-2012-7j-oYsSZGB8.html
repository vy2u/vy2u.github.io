husband John hello this is my way
Jennifer hi um yeah so I got an offer in
the mail from a company called the
jungle stands and my tasting buddy
Jackie hi Jackie Jackie sent me this
fabulous box and what they give you is
six samples of some kind of themed food
it is an experience a tasting experience
would you say it's they think very
definitely we know that this is a
tasting experience because we just
tasted everything in this box I will
tell you what's in here what's in here
or six tastes of delicious chocolate um
and I'm a huge chocolate fan I know
you're a huge chocolate fan we were very
excited to get six tastes of chocolate
and the pieces were like I don't know
like this big huh here's here's one of
the taste that we still have left so we
actually ate you know that's like half
of what we originally got so yeah it's
my size chunk so the whole thing about
this was it was supposed to be a blind
tasting um me that there was some kind
of secret ingredient that you had to
figure out and the problem with what we
just shot was we kind of gave away the
secret in our tasting so I'm going to
show you a little clip of some of the
things we can show you about our
experience tasting so here that is oh
yeah and let me tell you that chocolate
is like my favorite thing on the entire
planet like different except for maybe
like maybe my children but I'm not sure
they recommended that you get some milk
and some water so I'm a little curious
about why we need to do that it says
blind tastings can be devilishly fun and
quite instructive interesting I've never
heard of a mouth smell before before you
are six bean to bar handcrafted artisan
chocolates
and they all they all share a unique
secret ingredient for a bit of
mischievousness and fun the intensity of
the secret element increases as you go
of each level how many levels will you
need to uncover the mystery and will any
of these tastes change your life whoa
this chocolate is going to change our
life looks like chocolate looks like how
much yours Oh a hitch up at the end of
it it's like who what is that okay I'm
gonna eat the rest of it cuz it's
actually pretty good it'll convert
non-believers into artisan chocolate
aficionados this is fun trying to figure
this out it almost tastes like oki like
scotch or something like that like
or I was so scared that this was gonna
have like dead bugs and I like it was
hit each auklets covered cicadas or
something crazy and I was gonna have to
meet it because I've totally would have
holy moly this dark chocolate blend
definitely tickles your tongue good hit
you that's one stronger definitely
stronger that's exactly what this tastes
like exactly oh my goodness this is why
I need you that's why I love you that
was a good one though I would want to
buy that one well this is gonna be a
long video made by stone grinding cacao
beans with lava stones and this one
looks like dirty this is the Sandia
struck at bari of everything I'm gonna
have to talk to Jackie at the end of
this and make sure that i'm not giving
away the secret I don't even know if I
want to finish this one you want to
finish my supporters nothing what's a
water-rich full taste with complex
fruity and floral notes notice what
happens in your throat area who I'm a
little scared want to keep for you
should call it a cube one rectangular
prism for you oh you get better people
are now training video off
okay they turned off those of you better
news can stay holy moly but the
chocolate itself is good all right only
one taste left no George miss you're
right I can't read not only will you be
able to smell the secret element but
it'll pitch you at first bite I have a
feeling I'm about to get punched in the
mountain right well you know what the
kids say these days what's that Yolo
it's true you want cracker no no you're
so gonna be forever remembered on
YouTube for saying Yolo Carrie Smith oh
I have never tasted anything like that
in my entire life it tasted really good
though with what is the secret
ingredient I still don't really know so
what was your favorite number three I
think so too they add an interesting an
interesting flavor to it wasn't
overpowering recently different a peep
on the jungle Stan let us know where
what this stuff is like maybe that can
be like a little envelope with like the
information on the products inside so
you don't open it until you're done
tasting or something so that you know
what it actually was that would be
really nice well I'll ask Jackie my
tasting buddy Jackie we want to buy
number three how can we buy number three
it is good so that was kind of what it
was like to taste uh taste the taste bar
um it was a lot of fun we really enjoy
it and you have fun I had fun now let me
tell you about how this works it's nine
dollars and ninety two cents a month
it's a subscription service but they're
running a special right now we're with
you set up for a subscription then you
can send a subscription to a friend for
free as long as that person doesn't have
the same mailing address as you so I
think that's pretty cool so really what
it comes down to his five bucks a box if
you do it that way then thank you to
Jackie for sending this to me they did
not give me any compensation other than
the box do you know what they had last
month last month I searched on youtube
because I do that they had cookies this
box definitely even though I'm a huge
chocolate fan I probably wouldn't have
tasted if I had seen these kinds of
chocolates in the store
with labels on them I'm not sure if I
would have tried them um you might have
but i don't know i'm a little more
adventurous than you are yeah so if you
want to have the same experience that we
had then you can go to the website down
below and you can go and click on that
and subscribe and get another box just
like ours this is the december box and
it is still available so if you're
interested in that you can still get it
which is awesome and I think if you like
chocolate you should totally should
because it is definitely a tasting
experience we had fun i wish i could
show you the whole video but I can't
because I spoil it mad love and you
won't be in the next video I'll be in
the next video and I'll see you then
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
