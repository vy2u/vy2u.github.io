so schwa the beauty sampling program
this is a sponsored review by Sol Schwab
but you guys know that does not
influence my review at all I do not do
sponsored videos or get products and
review them unless the company is okay
with me being 100% honest I have done a
review for social all a long time ago
and we are back to do another updated
review let me tell you a little bit
about social ahhhh so you can know
whether this video is even worth
watching so what it is is you go on
their website and you can try luxury
beauty items and have them sent to your
house it is a beauty sampling program so
let's say you're going into a department
store and you want to go up to the
counter and you want them to try it on
your face before you buy it it's like
that but sent to your house so they send
you five beauty samples per month for
$15 that's the elite membership and you
get to pick which samples you want so
you set up a queue of what you want to
try and they send them to you so you can
set up a big long queue and then not
worry about it and then it just gets
shipped to you every month they also
send you email reminders if your queue
gets low and they don't have any
products that are in your list of things
to send they'll send you an email
reminder to load it up so you know they
know what products to send you there's
also two other ways you can use social
ah one is just to buy the samples at
five dollars apiece or you can do
something called the petite membership
it's fifty dollars a year and you can
try the products at three dollars per
sample so that ends up being that
fifteen dollars a month for that those
five samples but you can spread it out
at any time through the year also when
you're part of the elite system you earn
points so let me tell you a little bit
about how their point system works you
get two hundred fifty points or that's a
$5 credit every month to go toward any
full-size products on the site so you
don't have to use it toward the products
that you sampled you can use it toward
any product on the site you can stack up
up to $20 toward a product and the
points never expire so 250 points is
five dollars off an order of twenty five
dollars or more
five hundred points is $10 off orders of
$50 or more 750 points fifty $15 off of
$75 or more and then 100 points is $20
off orders of $100 or more so there are
some restrictions for how you can use
the points you can order only a maximum
of four full-size products every 60 days
from socha
you can also get refunds within 14 days
full refunds or you can do partial
refunds after the 14 days there's no
shipping cost on returns and
subscriptions will Auto renew so you
have to cut it off if you don't want it
any more but one thing that's really
good is you can skip a month if you want
to skip a month you just have to let
them know at least three days before the
subscription is about to renew and you
can skip a month and it didn't say there
was any limit to how many months you
could skip so that's pretty cool
so there's a quite a few things that
make so sois different than the typical
subscription box the first thing is that
they send you actual sample sizes it is
not deluxe samples they are samples the
point of the samples is to give you a
chance to try these luxury items to
decide whether you want to buy them or
not so you're gonna you're looking at
three to six uses per sample not a one
that you'll be able to use for a few
weeks so for the 15 dollar subscription
these are the items that I chose and how
they come now these syringes were more
full than they are now I have been using
the product so that I can give you an
idea of how they also perform cuz you
know I don't really do a lot of luxury
makeup because girlfriend doesn't have
money like that but I really like to try
the luxury makeup so this is actually a
really great subscription for me let me
tell you what I got and then I'm gonna
show you how I got this look today using
the products that are in this box so the
first thing I'm gonna be showing you is
the Chanel perfection Lumiere velvet
smooth effect makeup that full price is
48 dollars there are nine shades
available on the social website for
cheeks I have the Marc Jacobs air blush
soft glow duo and that this is number
506 flesh and fantasy and you can see
the size of the pan there I'm already
hitting pan this is I've used it three
times now so then the full-size of that
is $42 they do have five shades
available
then I have two lipsticks I have the YSL
rouge with left radiant lipstick and
ultimate beige and that's what I'm
wearing on my lips right now that's 37
dollars and there are seven shades
available on their site and then this
year is Tom Ford's lip color in Spanish
pink this is a $53.00 lipstick they do
have 12 shades available to choose from
on the website and then finally I have
the Kevin a quant celestial skin liquid
lighting highlighter in candle light
there are two shades available and this
is a $52 product so if I were gonna buy
the full sizes of every one of these
products you're looking at 246 dollars
worth of full-size products that I get
to try for my $15 subscription so that's
kind of cool also with the subscription
they send you tools to apply they sent a
blush brush and they also sent two lip
applicators for my lip products
depending on what you get they send you
the tools for whatever it is you got
they also sent me this which was really
nice I'm not sure how this comes whether
they send this in every box whether they
only send it with your first order I'm
not sure but it's like a little magnetic
Z palette here where you can take your
little pans that you get and you can put
them in there now I'm a big freak when
it comes to separating my lip products
from my powder products or cream from
powder products so I will only put the
powder product in here so I could keep
it separate but for the video I put it
back in here but I can see this is a
great way to organize your samples from
social wall so I think that's really
really cool so without further ado let's
go ahead and get into how I got this
look today using the products that I got
from social ahhhh
alright let's go ahead and test out the
products from soul Shwa
this is my little social I box and we're
gonna go ahead and test out what I got
and these are the samples and that I got
of these crazy expensive products we're
gonna go ahead and start with the Chanel
perfection Lumiere velvet smooth effect
makeup Chanel 22 should I put primer on
should I do that I probably should let's
get a fancy primer let's see what's the
fanciest primer I own I don't know and
love fancy primers so we'll see what I
can figure out the most expensive primer
that I own
the hourglass ambient primer but I don't
like this primer so we're not gonna use
that we'll use the cover effects
illuminating primer because I think
it'll go nicely with this foundation
press it in press it in press it in so
of course there's lots of ways to apply
foundation but unfortunately with the
subscription you don't get a lot of
product and I was very nervous to use
too much event before I reviewed it for
you so I've only ever tried this with
the artists oval 7 brush so I'm gonna go
ahead and apply it with that because it
did a really nice job when I did apply
it with it so let's go ahead and just go
for it and you can see it comes in this
little syringe and it's it's not really
a syringe in that you don't push it but
you kind of crank it up almost like a
Stila lip gloss I'm just gonna kind of
blop it well Wow Wow so like I said I'd
only use this one time before and I
still have a good couple of uses in it
I was pretty sparing with how much I was
using though because I was like I said I
was scared to use too much one thing I
like is it does have a rubber tip so
that it's very comfortable to go on it
goes on very smoothly all right here we
go
okay it's definitely a very light
coverage foundation
and like I said if I applied it with a
brush or with a Beautyblender it may
have different effects and with social
ah you can like let's say you want to
try it with different application tools
and you're not sure if you're gonna get
enough product you can order it up to
two of the exact same sample if you want
to so you might want to do that if you
try to order this foundation I'm gonna
put on a second coat of this because
this is a really light coverage and I
want more
so I think safely you could get probably
up to about three uses out of this
syringe at least with this formula
so it's still a light coverage I would
say it's pushing it to say this is a
medium coverage it's not it's not a
medium coverage it's pretty light but I
do think that it sits very nicely on the
skin I like the way it feels it's very
lightweight it doesn't feel overly oily
it doesn't feel dry it feels just nice
like I can't even feel it anymore it's
very very lightweight it did even out my
skin tone a little bit but honestly I
don't know if there's enough bang for my
buck on this foundation I did wear it
all day one day and lasting power was
just okay for me so I don't think this
is one that I would purchase but I am
thankful to have tried it so at this
point I am going to go ahead off-camera
and do my eye shadow eyeliner mascara
finishing all that up and I'll come back
for lips and cheeks okay you got my eyes
done let's go ahead and jump into the
lips next so I do have to let colors for
you that I want to try on for you I'm
gonna do the first one the lighter one
first this is Tom Ford's a lip color in
Spanish pink it is a very very famous
shade and I've never tried it before
because it's obnoxiously expensive so
I'm gonna pull off the little cover here
they do include lip brushes but I
personally don't like lip brushes I'm
just gonna use my fingertip
it smells so good it smells like vanilla
a vanilla cake
so I just realized as I'm putting this
on I forgot to exfoliate my lips so I'm
gonna wet and show you this I'm gonna
take it off I'm gonna exfoliate my lips
and then I'm gonna try again give you an
example it does kind of cling to dry
patches
so let's the foliate real quick and come
right back all right
that's much better so I scrubbed it with
my brown sugar lip scrub buy treat
beauty and then I put a little bit of
the bite Beauty agave lip mask on just
to kind of rehydrate a little bit and
then I just wiped off the agave lip mask
so now I feel like I am properly
prepared for 50 some dollar lipstick how
much does this thing fifty fifty three
dollar lipstick now I feel bad because I
wasted by about two dollars with a
product just there but you got to see
that it clings to dry patches oh so much
better so it feels amazing it feels like
so I can't even compared to a lip balm
because a lip balm to me is kind of kind
of oily this doesn't feel oily it just
feels smooth it just feels hydrating it
feels amazing I'm not sure if I am crazy
about the way that it sits on my lips I
want to love it but I I would if this
was a regular price even if this was
like an urban decay on lipstick
I would probably really like it but it's
like I don't know if it's worth the
price point it is pretty
oh no it's 53 dollars pretty what do you
think if you tried tomforde
lipsticks before do you think there
weren't the price so this next one here
is the YSL rouge beloved a radiant
lipstick and ultimate beige and when I
put this on I went ooh ooh I really like
this where I didn't really feel like
that about the Tom Ford I show yeah
it feels a little bit oilier than the
top four but I think it's supposed to be
see this lipstick it feels a little bit
oilier like I said but it definitely
liked the way that it sits on my lips
much better I like that it looks like
it's become part of my lips like my
natural lip color could be this color
you know yeah when you lay on some
lipsticks how it just looks like paint
on your lips I don't feel like this
looks that way and I really really like
it a lot
is it worth thirty seven dollars hmm
it's pushing it it's pushing it I think
that I can see myself buying maybe one
or two of these formulas just to have
just to enjoy but it would have to be
shades that I really really love I do
really like the shade I don't like it
with my eye look today but I do like it
with this shirt I think it looks nice
and this is something I would consider
purchasing I would I would consider
purchasing it because it feels so good
and also it had a lasting power on it
where I feel like the Tom Ford just kind
of wiped off and it was gone I felt like
with this the wear down was so nice and
I felt like it stayed on my lips for a
really long time so this one I do feel
like is kind of an over and above
lipstick where I feel like the Tom Ford
really wasn't for me maybe it's that
shade I don't know I really want to know
your opinions in the comments below I
have got to know because I am NOT a
luxury lipstick kind of person so if you
are I would love to read about it please
tell me the Marc Jacobs air blush soft
glow duo in flesh and fantasy and it
comes in this little pan your it's a
sample it's definitely a sample where I
feel like the lipsticks you're gonna be
able to get a quite a few uses out I
feel like the blush you're only gonna
get the same as the foundation just a
few uses out of it they did send this
brush to go with it and I did not like
the way this applied the blush I felt
like it applied it really patchy I felt
like it was just really difficult to
blend with it so I'm not going to use
this brush instead I'm going to use this
elf brush because I feel like I can get
into the product really nicely I can
kind of dig it in there this is the
new elf stippling brush from their new
fancy schmancy line let me show you how
this applies I have nothing on my cheek
except for the foundation and the primer
of course and look how beautiful it's
really pretty it's really really pretty
but I just feel I could give such a
natural flush to the cheeks you made it
may not be coming off as well on camera
because I am under these bright lights
but in my mirror it looks really really
pretty now it does have a highlighter
with it I'm actually not going to use
this highlighter because I have another
highlighter but the highlighter is
really pretty it's very natural I'm
going to swatch it on my hand and kind
of bring it up to the camera there we go
so I mean it's definitely a more natural
highlighter if you have a textured skin
this may be a really nice highlighter
for you I think it's a very nice blush
as well the blush is matte the
highlighter I believe is also mad it may
have well I don't know they might have a
little tiny bit of shimmer in them but
very very very very very subtle so let's
go ahead into the last product this is
the heaven of Kwan celestial skin liquid
lighting highlighter in candle light and
this I've only used once and I was
scared because I saw how much product I
used up just in a few dots I really feel
like they did not give a lot of product
here then I may be able to get three
uses out of this I'm like clicking up
forever and I felt like I was clicking
up forever before - like maybe there was
some air in the product so there's
nothing coming out right now there we go
okay
beyo
from space from space holy moly
this is a beautiful highlighter blends
right into the skin I like this better
than the first time I use it because I
think I didn't use enough the first time
because I was scared to use too much but
man that's gorgeous this is not for
people with textured skin this will show
your pores girlfriend or boyfriend but
it is beautiful so just some final
thoughts on social ah I feel like you
really have to either be a luxury makeup
lover or someone that just really wants
to try that luxury makeup just because
they give such small samples it's not
something that's going to be something
that you're going to get a huge bang for
your buck where you're really going to
enjoy this is bringing that beauty
counter into your home where you may
have gone to the mall to a counter and
got samples to take home or maybe had
the person apply them on you I feel like
this is more of a service rather than a
subscription box it definitely has its
target audience and I don't know whether
you are part of that target audience or
not but if you are I feel I feel like
this is a really good subscription I
feel like this is something that's a
good subscription for me as a makeup
reviewer that I get to try some of this
luxury makeup the girlfriend cannot
afford it so it's nice to be able to try
and be able to have an opinion about it
without having to spend for the full
cost because if you are going to get
even just one product that's five
dollars toward your full-size item that
you wouldn't have gotten if you bought
it at the counter and you got to try it
first so I really think it's a great
deal for that so that is my review of
