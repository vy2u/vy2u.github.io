want to put this out there and I feel
like that
my most genuine self does not want to
get all primped up for this I'm not
putting my contacts in I'm not putting
makeup on I just want to get my thoughts
out there on how I feel about this and
you know I'm not known for making good
judgments
you know without thinking them through
so I'm hoping that I've thought this
through enough to express myself and how
I'm feeling right now so if you're
curious about how I'm feeling about this
tape shape tape shape shaped tape shart
tape whatever you want to call it
situation hang tight I'm about to share
that with you right now so as you may
know Tarte just came out with a shaped
tape foundation I have to tell you I was
so excited about this launch we talked
about it on what's up and makeup the
community's really excited about it I
mean everybody was kind of like yes you
know because shaped shaped tape is just
known for being a really good concealer
for a lot of people personally it's
right now my go-to concealer it's the
one that I can grab and know that it
works really well for me I know there
are some people that it doesn't work
well for but it works great for me so I
was really excited about it then the
pictures of the shade range came out and
I was like oh my gosh like what are you
thinking I'm sorry if there's glare on
my glasses
I saw the shade range and I was like
okay if I do a review of this shade
range is definitely gonna be part of it
if you saw my Jeffrey star beauty killer
palette review you'll know kind of how
it review things like this I take out
you know the brand name I take out you
know everything out of it I review the
product for the product without drama
attached and then I go on to talk about
any other issues I did that as well with
the Jaclyn hill morphe palette I did the
same thing so that was what I was
planning on doing as my format for this
review I was still planning on reviewing
it so then I get this email from a
company that was representing Ulta for
the lawn they said hey we're looking at
a bunch of micro influencers and they
you know you're being considered for a
sponsored video for heart shape tape
foundation
I was really excited about it they
wanted me to do you know compare on one
side the hydrating one and one side the
matte side and it was going to be
sponsored and I said back I said yeah
great I said I'd loved oh and then
they'd want me to an Instagram post I
said yeah great I would love to do that
I can totally do that for you but just
you know it is going to be an honest
review they said okay we'll get back to
you
all right so then the next step was when
I saw the interview that PopSugar had
done with one of the representatives
from Tarte and this is what they said
I'll put it up on the screen now it says
from the PopSugar article a rep from
Tarte explained to PopSugar that even
when shake tape Foundation was revealed
the new colors were already in the works
talking about the ten shades that are
coming says additional shades are
usually added seasonally which makes
sense because your complexion tends to
be paler in the winter and darker in the
summer months but please wear sunscreen
kids okay that was where they lost me
that was where I was like they really
really don't realize that there are
people out there that are dark all year
round they really have no idea so then I
started getting a little mad about it no
it was like okay now I really need to
make this video because I need to call
this out like whether they you know send
it to me or not like I've got to mention
this because this is mess up you know
because the only people that that
applies to is light-skinned people you
know I mean I guess they're you know
people do get darker dependent you know
even people that are dark can get darker
but to say that we only need light skin
tones in the winter because we're gonna
tan later I mean are you kidding me how
narrow-minded can you possibly be so
I've got this idea okay this is what I'm
gonna do for the video this is what I'm
gonna say buh-bye and then I get the
email Y emailed them because I was
thinking about buying yet I emailed back
the company that email me I said hey did
they pick me or not because I'm sitting
here thinking in my head I didn't tell
them this but I was like s thinking his
thing in my head I want to purchase it
if they're not gonna send it to me they
email me back the next day said that I
was not chosen for the campaign like
cool so I went on Twitter I put up a
poll and I said hey you know do you guys
want me to review this the Matt the do
we are luminous whatever it's called or
do you want me to skip it all together
so it looks like the luminous is winning
so I'm sitting everything
okay I'm gonna let the poll go 24 hours
and I'm probably gonna buy the luminous
one then Alysha Alissa Ashley's video
dropped hey I'm like yes and I go over
to Lissa's videos like I get to hear
what Alyssa thinks of this because I
know Alyssa is going to give an honest
awesome review of this so Alyssa goes in
and she starts talking about the shade
range talks about how nothing really
matches her talks about the coverage a
little bit applies a little bit and she
stops the review short and then she says
you know what this is ridiculous I can't
support this brand I'm paraphrasing of
course I can't do this what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna remove this and we're gonna
talk about brands that do have inclusive
shade ranges and she just stopped the
video and I was like my selfish self no
my honest review no it's good you know
because I'm still trying to decide
whether I wanted to review it or not and
you know review the foundation and then
talk about the shades the shade range so
it was like no listen you can't stop
reviewing it I have to know what you
think why so my idiot self my impulsive
self goes into the comments I'm like
Alyssa you're killing me man like you
know you stopped in them in the middle
of the review like I thought I was
really looking forward to that I wish I
just finished the review because I've
needed to know from you because you're
special you know in a sea of people that
I don't trust I trust Alyssa
so my short-sighted selfish self was
like no of course I got slammed in the
comments section I mean people were like
you totally missed the point and all of
a sudden like no I didn't miss the point
I'm just sad because my honest review is
now Paul Who am I gonna trust Who am I
gonna trust now you know what I mean so
eventually I think Alyssa ended up
deleting the comment because it stopped
getting comments and when when someone a
creator deletes a comment the person
commented doesn't see that it was
deleted it still looks like it's there
but no more comments are ending up on
there's no more likes there's no more
anything so I think a listen to leave at
the comment which is great because it
wasn't conveying what I was trying you
know all of my inner mental workings and
I forget sometimes that people they make
connections with things
they they take things to a deeper level
than than what I necessarily mean things
to be and I shouldn't have made that
comment because it was very selfish from
my own point of view because all I'm
thinking about is I'm trying to decide
whether I want to review this foundation
and I wanted to hear what Alisa had to
say and now I'm not gonna get to hear it
I wasn't thinking about the big huge
picture I was seeing a tree instead of
the force so anyway so I thought about
it and thought about I mean this is all
happening like midnight last night I
thought about and I thought about it and
you know of course you know this morning
and last night I was up to like two
o'clock in the morning after it happened
I'm like what am I gonna do because now
I've made an ass of myself and you know
I looked at my Twitter poll and it seems
like more people are saying that I
shouldn't review it and I you know I I'm
not one to jump on a bandwagon I don't
do things because it's the cool kid
thing to do if I choose not to review
the foundation I want it to be because
my heart tells me that reviewing the
foundation is not a good idea
why didn't they wait until they had all
of them and released them all at the
same time there's a couple of reasons
why I think this is the big reason why I
think it's because right now like being
you know the you know post of what's up
and make up and seeing all these
police's come in there really isn't a
lot being released right now so it's a
really smart move on tart spark
monetarily to release the foundation now
because there's no competition they wait
a couple months there's gonna be a lot
more competition so there's gonna be
people with more choices of new
foundation so I think that they probably
release the easier shades and the ones
they felt would sell more which are the
lighter shades they released those first
and from what I've heard from from
talking to brands and things the deeper
shades are much more difficult to
develop because they're harder to get to
true skin tones so they probably assumed
I'm thinking that based on what they
said in PopSugar you know that they
don't need to release the deeper shades
which really makes me angry because this
is a very highly anticipated launch this
isn't like no-name brand ex releasing
foundation that's just gonna get lost in
the shuffle
this is flippant arc-shaped tape you
know what I mean listen
is a big deal so everybody's gonna want
to try this and I think that they should
have made sure whether they lost money
on releasing it early or not they should
have made sure that they had an
inclusive shade range for everybody that
would want to try it or at least at
least look like they made an effort I
mean this picture is to me unacceptable
the it doesn't even make any sense and
and it makes me upset because I feel
like they should know better number one
and number two who the world are they
hiring to help them with this who are
their PR people who are the people that
are developing this that are saying that
this is okay they all look the same they
all have to say why do they need to do
it's stupid it's absolutely stupid and I
hear I hear constructive criticism Kelly
in my ear and I'm not gonna bring her in
because this video is not a joke in any
way and what I hear her saying is it's
just makeup
why are people taking this so seriously
it's just makeup because it isn't in
this situation it isn't about just
makeup it's about excluding people
purposely at least I feel like it's
purposely for profit reason for profit
reason and that's where I see it being
about more than makeup it's about not
caring about a huge group of people
because you're trying to make more money
and that's--it's really wrong with me
those are the reasons really why I'm not
going to review the shape tape
foundation and I you know there's a part
of me that's really really sad about
that because I know there are a lot of
my viewers because let's be honest most
of my viewers do look more like me than
they do like ELISA and there are shades
for a lot of my audience and I'm sure
that a lot of my audience would benefit
from a review on my channel but I have
to go with my heart and I have to go
with my gut and I have to go with what I
feel is right and at this point I don't
feel it's right for me to review this
foundation until
heart somehow tries to fix this
situation I don't know what they're
gonna do to try to fix it I don't even
know if they can fix it at this point
but it's not something I'm interested in
spending my money on and giving you know
my my review on at this point I don't
know if I'm gonna review it in the
future I don't know what's gonna happen
but as of now I won't be reviewing the
torch shake tape foundation because I
just can't I can't from my heart tells
me no my heart tells me this is not
something that I want to be a part of
other than to say part can do better and
other brands can do better and you know
unless you were a teeny tiny company
that just seriously just does not have
the funds to do forty shades tart is not
one of those there's no reason to not do
you know at least thirty shades in an
initial launch
I mean if hooda beauty can do it tart
can do it you know what I mean so that's
my thoughts on this I know this is
hopefully this wasn't too long-winded
but I wanted to put this out there in
more of a raw format because I think
it's important I had a different video
that I had planned to put up today but
this is the one's gonna go up today and
then you know Friday all I should have a
video up but for those either
disappointed that I'm not going to
review it just as I felt in my heart
when I saw Alyssa wasn't going to review
it because she was my honest review I'm
sorry to those people I just had I have
to go with my heart on this one and my
heart says no yes so I want to thank you
so much for watching this video and
hearing me out I appreciate it and I'd
love to you and tart fix it
fix it thank you at least as best as you
can I don't know how much you can fix it
but at least try alright
mad love we'll see in a video soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
