mattes and you have 4 they call them duo
crows we'll get into that in a bit of
the whole duochrome e'fang I'm gonna
hold off but I got something to say
about that hello my friends welcome to
my review on the tardis pro pallets that
just came out not too long ago I am so
excited to review this for you because
there are so many mixed reviews people
seem to either really love this palette
or really dislike it so I'm very excited
to have my hands on it so I can tell you
from my point of view what I thought of
it before I go any further I want to
thank my friend Rosie community member
Rosie for sending this to me hers came
broken and then there was a
miscommunication with Tarte they ended
up accidentally sending her to Sochi to
replacement one so she ended up sending
one to me which was so nice of her she
did not have to do that so Thank You
Rosie for setting this to me it means so
much I was not planning on buying it
because I I will tell you this right now
I don't typically like tart eyeshadows
and I know this I know this about me and
actually I do have the tartlet palette
but this was actually sent to me by my
friend Veronica VCB Veronica sent this
to me because she did not like it she
has very deep skintone she did not feel
like it worked for her skin tone she
felt like it muddied on her eyes when I
tried it on my light skin tone it
muddied on my eyes I did not like it
either so now it sets happily in a
drawer for review purposes to compare it
to other things I keep it because when
these think kinds of things come out I
have a comparison palette for you I'm
just gonna let you know this video is
going to be jam-packed with information
you may see the number of minutes that
this video is and it's a lot but that's
why I have skip ahead buttons down below
if you're interested in a specific
section of the video they're listed
there they're listed over next to me so
that you can know whether there's some
part of it you would rather see you
don't necessarily have to watch the
entire review for example if you've
already seen swatches you don't
necessarily need to watch my swatches I
am doing this review slightly
differently because I've been getting a
lot of comments about well so-and-so
said this about the palette and you said
this and this person said this I
typically don't watch other people's
reviews before I film my own because I
don't want to be influenced so what I
chose to do this
because I wanted to hear what were
people saying as far as the pros and
cons of this palette because it's either
you really like it or really really
don't like this palette I watched a lot
of them but only after I had formulated
all of my opinions I watched them
yesterday and today instead of early on
because I wanted to have a solid opinion
in my head before I watched anyone elses
so I wasn't influenced over the past
couple days I had been watching a lot of
reviews of this some of them say thar
deist by the way which phonetically is
correct because if you think about words
like adventurous that ended in E they
drop the e and add the is T well chart
has decided not to drop their e they're
keeping it but they do want us to
pronounce it
hardest if you watch the Tarte YouTube
channel they talk about the tardis clay
paint liner they talk about this palette
and they pronounce it hardest so that's
the way I am going to pronounce it so
within this palette you do have 16
mattes and you have four they call them
duo probes we'll get into that in a bit
of the whole duochrome e'fang I'm gonna
hold off but I got something to say
about that so sixteen that's four duo
Chrome's and all of them are of shades
of Browns and reds and then we've got
this grain a shade down here according
to my notes that I took this is a
cruelty free product it is also gluten
free paraben free but it is not vegan
the ingredients that I saw that we're
not vegan are derived from beetles like
carmine I believe it's beetles it's some
kind of bug I'm pretty sure it's beetles
so it is not vegan even though it is
cruelty-free it is made in the United
States it's currently available at Ulta
Sephora and available at tart calm I
believe it's available in store in
Sephora and Ulta as well as online one
thing I could say that is that I really
do love this packaging I hope that Tarte
continues with this packaging I think
it's fantastic it's very very hard the
clasp on it is extremely strong I don't
see this opening up and travel it clicks
down very strong and then when you open
it up the mirror stays up it's a very
large mirror and it doesn't flop back
like a lot of pallets so I really like
that about this and I do hope Tarte
keeps this packaging because it's
wonderful
so for price program each one of these
20 pans has one
gram of product leading us to 20 grams
of product that is two dollars and
sixty-five cents per gram it is a $53 I
shadow palette so two dollars and
sixty-five cents per gram is pretty
reasonable for a higher-end so for a
brand prestige brand product it's
reasonable it's not super cheap it's not
super expensive it's a lot less
expensive than let's say the modern
renaissance in price per gram next up
I'm going to show you the swatches of
all of these shades I hope you enjoy
that and we'll be right back right now I
need a beige now I call me to not around
I say name but you're not around
every day lose my mind
nobody
now that you have seen the swatches next
we're going to go into ingredient
analysis this is a part where I go on
ewg or Environmental Working Group
dot-org and I check out the ingredients
that are in the palette and find out if
there's anything for sensitive skin or
acne prone skin or anything yucky in
there that ewg says is not safe for you
things like that and one thing I can say
is this formula as far as the types of
ingredients that do show up as red flags
on GWG are very very similar to the Kat
Von D review that I just did of the
metal matte palette it's almost it's
pretty much the exact same red flag
ingredients they are not formula dupes I
will tell you that right now as far as
the Kat Von D and this so if you saw
that one as being a cleaner product this
one is also the same way I will tell you
what those red flag red products are
okay the first one that is not
surprising is talc this does include
talc chowk is a filler it's kind of one
of those
it's a filler that they have the
pigments but they need something for the
pigments to stick to something to kind
of fluff up the product to give it more
substance so tau can be an allergen for
some people some people are very
sensitive as a talc and I'm going to
read a couple things for you this is
studies by the national toxicology panel
demonstrated that cosmetic grade talc
free of asbestos which is this cosmetic
grade talc there is some evidence to say
that it is toxic and carcinogenic but
there are data gaps they're not sure
they haven't done enough research so
talc was nominated by the National
Institute of Occupational Safety and
Health or the NI oh Sh for study by the
NTP which is the national toxicology
program because of widespread human
exposure it's in so many products and
because of lack of adequate information
on its chronic toxicity and potential
carcinogen allottee carcinogen the city
cut carton it potential would be a
carcinogen okay I don't know why I can't
say this word today it is restricted in
Cosmo
same Canada in the UK which just means
that you can't they just regulate it
more heavily than they do in the United
States it is not regulated in the United
States how much talc you can put in a
product but it is regulated in Canada
and the UK
the next one is at the hexyl palmitate
and fxo palmitate is a pigment wetting
agent it's basically to make the the
shadow soft and moist but it's not a
silicone base it is in human irritant I
did find out that one of my favorite
subscribers her sister I believe she
said someone in her family is highly
allergic to Etha hexyl palmitate so it
is an irritant for some people putting
this on your eyes if you have an
allergic reaction it's probably the
ephah hexyl palmitate or that's one of
the ingredients it could be the other
one it could be is the phenoxyethanol
and this is a preservative they use it
instead of parabens preservatives are
very very important cosmetics so that
the cosmetics don't grow mold and
bacteria it's restricted in cosmetics in
Japan it is a skin irritant for skin and
eyes so that's another thing but again
it's only if you're sensitive to it if
you have the Kat Von D metal matte I
mean it's in so many eyeshadow palettes
and if you have not had problems with
eye shut up how it's being irritants on
your eyes it will probably not bother
you either one of those ingredients the
next one is something called
ultramarines it's a blue pigment and
it's composed of sodium aluminium
silicate and sulfate and may be produced
and synthetically it is restricted in
cosmetic use for concentration or
manufacturing it's only for products
around the lips so do not put these
shadows on your lips there are a lot of
them that have the ultramarines in them
they are not lip safe there are 65
studies that have been identified on
ultramarines and whether they are
harmful or not and the data has been
inconclusive so just so you know we just
don't have a lot of information about
ultramarines and don't put it on your
lips so overall I mean there's nothing
in here that it's like no stay away it's
super bad but there are some things if
you have sensitive skin that may bother
you the thing that I decided to do was
to do a formula comparison between the
other tartlet palettes so this one and
the tart Linden bloom which was the
second one that I don't own I wanted to
just see whether the formula was the
same or different because I personally
felt like I liked the tourist probe
formula longevity
is better than I like the original
tartlet so when I looked I found that
the tart lit with the pro had let's
cease so the tartlet the original
tartlet and the pro palette i compared
the matte shades of classic and supermom
those are the ones that are the matte
cream shades so here is supermom here
supermom they're classic which is here
because I wanted to get shades that were
similar in tone and I can't compare
every single shade next to each other it
would take me a week to get an extra
week to get this out but they're similar
so I wanted to compare the matte shades
the matte cream shades and this is what
I found with those two shades in
formulas they have 65% of the same
ingredients but they're all mixed up so
they are not formula dupes so then when
I did the Tarte Lindblom of course I
don't have that one I compared classic
and charmer from the Tarte linen bloom I
found that 78% of the ingredients were
the same but again they were all jumbled
up one thing is that the tartlet in
bloom and the Tarte Pro both have
vanilla extract in it they have a
vanilla scent so if you don't like
scented products you're not going to
like this because it does have a
relatively strong vanilla scent the
original tartlet does not have that in
it now comparing the shimmer shades the
original tartlet has no shimmer shades
so I compared to the tartlet in bloom I
went and looked at glam in the Pro
palette along with rocker which is the
shimmer that's in the bloom palette and
about 70% of the ingredients are shared
but again they're all mixed up so we are
looking at a different formula in the
tardis Pro palette but also keep in mind
that pretty much every single one of
these shades has its own unique order in
which it they mix up the different
ingredients so they're going to interact
differently in each and every shade and
that goes for the tartlet and the
tartlet and bloom they just use a lot of
different formulas but overall they're
using the same ingredients and then just
mixing them up but again they're not
formula dupes
in that they don't use all of the exact
same ingredients but 70% is quite a lot
so bottom line are they the same no are
they similar
absolutely so now that you know all that
if you've made it this
far I'm gonna go ahead and show you the
demo of the look that I did today I
wanted to challenge myself to use that
bottom shade that shade trendy I have
two shades that look almost exactly like
this and I can tell you I very rarely if
ever use them so I wanted to go out of
my comfort zone and use them I tried to
do a halo eye it didn't quite work out
the way that I had expected and you know
I'm not a makeup artist I'm just a
makeup enthusiast so you know if there
wouldn't be through the demo I think it
came out pretty good though I
considering and then I had never really
used a shade like this before I think it
came out okay but I was determined to
use the shape for you to show you one
way you can do it so I hope you enjoyed
the demo here it comes
you shouldn't be traveling on your own
I'll jump right over into cold water for
you and take a stand
with you
Oh
sometimes you know it's how we learn and
how we go
away with you to the mall
you should be fighting
you take us to places our so be patient
with you
Oh
to go
Oh
products applied to the eyes and see how
that works I do want to now go into my
full review of the product one thing
that I can appreciate let's talk about
some positive one thing I definitely
appreciate is the color selection in
here I appreciate that they have put
these in rows that are easy to navigate
for someone that isn't a makeup artist
you can go straight across and get a
look out of each row I stuck to this
bottom row today but you can do that all
the way across for any of them of course
you can skip around and do what you want
and I think where the problem comes in
where a lot of people have said that the
mattes muddy on the eyes I think where
the problem comes in is when you use too
many of these middle shades together
they definitely money together you have
got to pick from the outside one from
the outside one from the middle and one
from the end you can't play in the
middle too much because if you do they
will muddy but if you you really can get
some good separation if you go light
medium and deep and kind of pick in
there mixing the shimmers in there
definitely does help I do want to get
into speaking of the shimmers about the
whole duochrome thing you saw in the
swatches that these are not duo chromes
duo chromes means two Chrome's two
distinct colors the only one that has
two distinct colors is trendy down here
these do not have two distinct colors
there you could push it you could push
it and say that this one here this minx
and this glam have pink undertones but
that's pushing it it really is and this
one I don't know what kind of undertone
they were trying to go for it's a bronze
it's a bronze maybe brown undertones but
I mean there's no separation of two
tones it's just not real
and I very not happy with Tarte for
marketing these as duo crumbs because
they're absolutely not except for this
one if you're going to make a duo chrome
make a duo chrome go look at makeup geek
see where her duochrome look like and
then that's where you want to go that's
the definition this is not a duo chrome
this is a dual chrome now speaking of
the shade another thing I want to
mention is that this shade is do pible
and I can tell you where an exact dupe
is and the
zag dupe is in the comfort zone palette
by wet-and-wild and I can tell you that
this one lasts very nicely on the eyes
the wet and wild is on my pointer finger
and the the Tarte one is going to be on
my ring finger so first is wet and wild
second is tart and they're pretty much
exact dupes I'm going to bring this up
real close you can see
so if you were going to get this palette
just for trendy don't go get yourself a
$5 wet and wild palette at the drugstore
okay but that being said as far as
formula wise I really like these shades
here I think they're fantastic but these
here I think tarts really come on to
something with these shades here this
formula is really really good and I
haven't seen a review yet that does not
think that these these shimmer shades
are good I'm not going to call them dual
crumbs cuz than that but they're really
really good the matte shades they do
kick up powder a lot of people talk
about them picking up powder they
absolutely do but I don't think it's as
much as let's say a lorac powdered a
lorac shadow will powder up these powder
up a lot less you just need to make sure
you tap off your brush they're very very
pigmented and like I said if you don't
want them too muddy you just can't hang
out in the middle there you can't are
they're going to muddy together so what
I decided to do was do a wear test and
it's a very informal wear test I just
put on my shadows before I went to the
movies with my kids I did the monitor
Renaissance believe it or not from
honest Asya Beverly Hills on one side of
my face one of my eyes and then the
other eye I put on the Tarte palette and
I wore the shadows all day and so I mean
they're not dupes I mean you can look at
them the the palettes are not dupes but
there are enough similar shades that I
could pull off a look between the two
that was similar even though they
weren't the same enough that nobody
would really notice except for me so I'm
going to go ahead and show you that
footage now so you can decide for
yourself about lasting power and how
those shadows went on the eye day is not
a filming day but I wanted to try
something different and the anasazi
amounted renaissance palette has gotten
so much hype for being amazing so I'm
going kind of off what I normally do
prep outs on this side mono Renaissance
is on this side and I'm going to show
you I tried to find matching shades just
using natural light here so hopefully
you can see so this side is the matching
shades I found in the the Tarte palette
and then this is the modern renaissance
it's not exact dupes but I don't think
anybody's going to notice because you
know where my glass you know it and you
know just a regular day you know no
lashes mom
but I'm going to check back in with you
all later and show you the way or time
I'm wearing the Coastal Scents primer
which is almost the exact same formula
at the Urban Decay primer potion so I
expect it to perform well because I've
used it many many times with many many
shadows and I really love that primer so
we will check back in with you guys in a
little while all right
see it a bit good luck tor hopefully you
can keep up alright natural light is
gone it has been 9 hours since I put on
my eye shadow and you're going to check
it out and see how it looks so if you
remember this is the Tarte Pro side and
this is the Anasazi up modern
renaissance side now I looked in the
mirror and I looked very closely as much
as I could and my dogs walking
clickety-clacking with his nails on the
hardwood so excuse the noise but I
looked very closely and it feels like at
least from me looking it looks like the
tart side the colors kind of mush
together more but unless you're really
really looking like I don't feel like
there's that big of a difference between
the tart side and the Anasazi aside as
far as the lasting power of it I don't
know I'm starting to be a little
skeptical of whether this is just this
is a bad palette I am not seeing it I'm
just not seeing that it's bad I mean you
saw the separation of color in the
original look and of course you're
seeing the rest of the video you know I
don't know I mean you're gonna have to
look and see what you think but I think
they look almost the same I mean I feel
like maybe the deeper colors have faded
a little more on the tart side but
overall is it really that much different
from the modern renaissance as far as
where time oh no I'll be curious to know
what you think in the comments below
mmm so I'm still sticking with this is
not a bad palette but I don't think it's
for everybody so let me tell you who I
think this is for and who I think it is
definitely not for I feel like they
palette is format lovers for people that
really love matte shadows are primarily
doing matte looks and just like a pop of
shimmer every once in a while these
three shades here are very nice lid
colors there there beautiful lid colors
this ones of course a little bit more
difficult to work with but I'm glad that
they included it because it made the
palette more unique to tart unique in
the world
no max got one I've got one from Kat Von
D show my Kat Von D one this is the old
shadows called on the road but this one
from Kat Von D comes off very very
similar it's a little warmer in the
undertone but comes off very very
similar I mean there's tons of shades
like this but I am glad they include it
because it is unique to Tarte if you
have the the Tarte
original or the Tarte in bloom or if you
just have a lot of neutral matte shadows
you probably want to skip this there's
nothing magical about it I am looking
forward to Tarte hopefully continuing to
do more pallets with this formula though
I feel like it's just they've got
something really good there but I mean
if you're not if you're getting this for
the shimmers don't don't bother because
there's there's just not enough of them
in the palette to make it worth it and
it's really primarily a matte palette
with a little bit of shimmer thrown in I
don't know I'm just not I don't find it
to be unique I don't find it to be
especially fun to work with and you know
and this is something somebody that has
a lot of eyeshadow palettes but if you
are let's say somebody with aging lids
who loves matte eyeshadows this may be
something you definitely want to pick up
I would recommend this for you anybody
with with texture on their lids I would
recommend this palette so that is my
review of the tardis pro palette I hope
