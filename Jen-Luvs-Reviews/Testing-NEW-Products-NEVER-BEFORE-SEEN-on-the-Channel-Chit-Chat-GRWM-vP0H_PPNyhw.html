getting ready with me video I am going
to be kind of giving you some channel
updates as I try some products that are
brand new to me and also some ones that
I have just tried a little bit but I
haven't talked about on the channel so
I'm really excited to share those with
you including the coastal scents of
faerie fuchsia palette so stay tuned for
that and how I got this look today
when we get into getting ready with me I
just want to let you know why I am
featuring this pallidus hall it was sent
to me by Coastal Scents that this is not
a sponsored video and the reason why
this is not a sponsored video is that
every time I do a dedicated video for
Coastal Scents this is kind of a
dedicated video I'm going to be
highlighting this a lot
they give me a hundred dollar gift card
for Coastal Scents but I typically give
those away and this is no different I am
going to be giving away the Coastal
Scents gift cards that is my payment for
this video
so if you would like to win the Coastal
Scents gift card all you need to do is
comment down below that you are
interested in the gift card and you are
entered to win I'll be picking a winner
within the next week or so this kind of
depends on when of you start to die on
this video so that is happening or right
now before we get into the getting ready
with me let me just tell you a little
bit about this it just came out
it's 1295 and it looks like this on the
outside it's very girly and butterfly is
looking and then inside yellow plastic I
haven't even watched this yet and it
looks like this on the inside lots of
you shall purpley kinds of shades so if
you enjoy those shades then this might
be something you want to check out again
I haven't used it yet but we're going to
try it on camera and I'm going to give
you my first impression review on it I
did do an ingredient analysis on this
nothing out of the ordinary
how sxo palmitate so if you're anti palm
oil that's the thing or if you're
allergic to FX the palmitate that's the
thing and these are not lips safe you
don't use them on your lips cruelty free
status Coastal Scents says they're
cruelty free they're very very big on
saying that on their website they do
have a cruelty free little bunny on the
back I'm not sure which money this is i
know it's not the peta bunny but i will
put it in the description down below it
says there it is paraben free they are
made in China though so just so you know
I'm actually going to hold off on this
for just a minute and let's go ahead and
apply some of these new products so the
first one is the elf hydrating face
primer I have not used this yet so let's
go ahead and try this it is of a green
color so that makes me a little bit
nervous so they don't really need any
redness correction and I'm just
realizing that it is not green it is a
clear looks like it's going to end up
being clear no scent to it so that's
really good see
silicon e very very smooth I smell a
little bit of plastic now that it's
going on but if you're very nice I don't
know if it feels hydrating as it more it
feels silicone II let me just do a
little pressing into the skin kind of
see if I can fill the pores a little bit
silicone E and on the edge of oily I'm
not sure if you have oily skin whether
you'll enjoy this feeling or not because
now that it's on there it really feels a
little bit oily that's kind of odd I'm
not sure how much I like that I'm not a
big fan of face oils and things I use
them sometimes but they're not my
favorite format so I'm not sure how I
feel about that all of these products if
you've tried them I'd love to know what
you think in the comments below so I
could learn from your experience as well
alright we're going to move on to the la
splash this is their new foundation and
cashew I did get this at IMATS
this was given to me by la splash it
looks like this on the inside a little
bit of a floral e kind of scent to it
not big fan of the pot foundation just
in general because I don't like dipping
my fingers in it but you'll do what you
gotta do
so first big channel announcement that I
want to tell you about is about this
summer because this summer I'm going to
be traveling quite a bit with the family
my first trip we're taking is we're
going to New York so we're going to be
doing New York and Toronto at the end of
June so that means that this summer the
content will not be as much as you are
used to seeing also I will have my kids
home which makes a big difference on how
much I can get done mmm
I don't know if I should have put that
over my lips or not it makes a big
difference with how much I can get done
when the kids are home versus when
they're at school so expect a drop in
the number of videos that you're seeing
we're looking at more like one review
one big review a week along with the
makeup minute and what's up in makeup
what's up and make it should be
continuing except for when I'm away so
like when I'm away for Toronto I am
going to Toronto generation Beauty which
I'm super excited about so when I'm away
so that there won't be a what if in
makeup episode because it's just too
hard to what do the makeup on the road
for the most part okay so I'm not sure
if I like the application of this maybe
I probably shouldn't have used a face
primer that I never used before with a
bit of foundation that I don't have a
lot of experience with because I feel
like it's breaking up on my skin like
right here it looks really bad it spread
really badly and I really don't think
that it's the foundation said use this
foundation many times and have never had
a problem with that let me grab hold on
grab my artis oval 7 and see if I can
get it to spread out a little better
maybe it's a Marc Jacobs brush mmm still
looks really bad around my nose so I
don't know if you can see that but it's
really patchy right there like I just
really don't like the way this looks at
all and I haven't had that experience in
the past with this so I'm blaming the
primer and i just relized my eyebrows
aren't done so we're just going to keep
on rolling so the other option would be
to wash my face and start over but I'm
not going anywhere today I'm just
filming videos my daughter's actually
home sick today so she's resting in the
other room and I was kind of home taking
care of her and filming I got this I
believe at generation Beauty this is the
note BB concealer advanced skin
corrector and it says paraben free on it
and it's got like a little like reminds
me of the little ironing board thing
that I think was on that benefit
under-eye cooling something or another I
like have a vision of it in my head it
looked like a little iron but I can't
remember what it is so it does feel very
cold I know my under eye let's go ahead
and squirt a little bit out ooh that's
not good you see that oil dripping out
that's just separation hold on so it may
have been that it just settled some
because I have had it open I have tried
it but not on camera yet just kind of
squeeze a little bit out onto my towel
and try again
mmm I won't do that again I'm not sure
if I like this I don't know it's
spreading pretty nicely and try to get
that triangle shape you guys even see
what I'm doing I just realized I wasn't
facing the camera at all yeah I think in
the future I'm just going to squeeze it
out on to my finger and
put it on I might just have to tap it
out my fingers and finding that I like
more and more with concealers to tap
them out in my finger yeah that coverage
is definitely better than with the brush
got to not poke myself in the odd oh I
forgot shadow shield sent me these did
you see my what the K video where I did
the knockoff shadow shield shadow
shields I contacted them and just wanted
to make sure that they were knockoffs
and they said hey let's say else we'll
send you some real ones so they sent me
a couple boxes of these so I've wanted
to try these now I put concealer on so
now I'm all like should I even try them
yeah I think I'm going to try them
anyway if you've never seen shadow
shields before the idea is is that it
catches the fallout and also helps you
make a nice line over on the side but
before that I wanted to show you a trick
that I found if you get boxycharm I got
the concealer palette this is the
measure different measurable different
concealer palette from boxycharm and
it's got all these shades in it and me
as not being a makeup artist I don't
find a lot of use for these but what I
was doing is I've been using these as
eye shadow primers and they've been
working really really well let's do the
shade cream up here at the top and I'm
going to use that all over my lids
someone mentioned in the comments that
they saw the exact same concealer
palette at five below and if you don't
have a five below near you it's
basically like a dollar store but
everything is five dollars or less which
I was really disappointed to hear that
it's possible to get it for a $5 side
note boxycharm you know the original
price that they mentioned on boxycharm
is way more than five dollars I remember
what it is I think it might be twenty
but I have been using that as an
eyeshadow primer I've use it a couple
times that have really been enjoying it
and actually now that I'm thinking about
I should probably do my brows this may
work and this may be a complete and
total disaster I'm going to try to use
the dark concealer on my as a brow
powder I'm going to try to use espresso
because we're just experimenting today
it's a little too light for me for my
brows my brows are so dark I think I
might be able to get away with it just
for this video but if you have lighter
brows it may work it's very warm though
and I would need more of a cool tone
shade but we'll just keep going with it
who cares man it's just makeup it's just
fun we're just playing today so the
second thing that I want to tell you
about the second trip we're taking is
we're actually going to sell Paulo in
Brazil my husband was invited to a
tattoo convention down there so we are
going to Sao Paulo in July I believe
it's early July earlier mid-july
so I'm not sure if there's going to be a
whatsapp and make up that week or not it
just kind of depends because I am NOT
going out in Sao Paulo with the kids
without my husband so there's going to
be a lot of hotel time that weekend
where we're just going to be kind of
sitting in the hotel so I'm alcohol
deboard so I might actually be able to
do like I'm the kind that I do where
it's just the photos and not me
I might be able to do something like
that just to get something up for the
news yeah I don't hate it
I don't love it but I don't hate it it's
not terrible I don't know how bad does
that look we're just going to keep going
so now we'll go ahead and do the shadow
shield
that's interesting so this one has it's
got four parts it's got a sensor and
then it's got two on the sides and then
it's got one on the bottom and I think
what I'm going to do is just do the top
portion and kind of angle that
like yeah and then it's supposed to like
catch the fallout so I think I'm going
to be able to do one I picked I'm like
this it kind of holds the lid in place
and makes it difficult definitely
doesn't look cute I'll show you that
you've got a nice little transition
shade right here so we're going to go
ahead and do that and then the final
trip that I wanted to tell you all about
well I do this is the we're doing a
beach trip and that is going to be in
the beginning of August so chances are
there will not be much content that week
I don't think I'm going to do the road
trip vlogs like I did last time because
it was too stressful and I didn't
realize how stressful it was going to be
to try to make sure I got them up and I
never did finish the last episode like
ever never did I never finished it yeah
it was just too stressful so I'm not
going to do that again so I want to
focus on spending time my family the
other thing I'm not going to do this
time is meetups because that was another
thing that was stressful was trying to
organize the meetups tried not to get
robbed you know that was kind of a
negative was getting my car broken into
and robbed in Indianapolis that really
stunk but meeting people was amazing
it's just I feel like I want to focus on
spending time with my family so we'll
probably won't do any kind of Meetup
except for if you're going to generation
Beauty in Toronto then of course I would
love to meet you if you're there alright
let's go ahead and we're going to do
this shade the shimmery shade all over
the lid and these can be use either wet
or dry so I might try them wet but I
want to try it dry first and see what
happens
see if you can see let me turn this way
so you can see better very nice I like
that it's not super punchy I bet you if
I wet is really punchy err this is
another thing that I own that I've never
used a L'Oreal infallible Pro setting
spray and the advice I've been given
quite often when I talk about using
setting spray is to spray the spray the
powder that is already on the brush to
the purpley shimmery one and then I'm
going to spray it with this L'Oreal
spray okay we're going to try it that
way and see how it goes that's got a
strong scent I wasn't expecting that and
we definitely have more shine
sorry this way definitely have a lot
more shine with the brush wet very nice
I like that we'll be going down south
for the beach so we're going to be going
down in Virginia and North Carolina
we're going to go to Outer Banks and
that's going to be kind of the end of
the summer so the big takeaway from that
is that we're not going to be around a
lot so content on the channel is going
to be different and not as much maybe
not different just not as much so we're
going to use this shade over on the
outer corner and stop it turn this way
and most shadows when you have purples
they gray out and I feel like this wood
is going to be no different as far as
the graying of it that's a bummer
the purple isn't really shining through
but it is kind of a gray tone purple I'm
going to use a little bit of the black
in the outer corner try to smoke it out
a little bit a blend so we ended up with
more of a gray look than a purple look
this I would definitely wouldn't call
this purple in any way or fuchsia I'm
going to try one of these lighter
purpley shades the pinky shade this one
right here and see if I can get it to be
a little more colorful oh I forgot I
need to hold my brush down lower people
keep telling me hold your brush down
lower dude
I think I'm going to have to use a
little bit of that setting spray I'm
using such a tiny brush so that I can be
really detailed in where it ends up
you see the shadow shield is definitely
picking up some song out there okay it's
still not super punchy as far as the
color but that may have been due to the
shade that I laid down first might be
overpowering everything so I'm just
going to hit up my brow bone with this
lighter shade right here people asking
all the time is what this mirror is this
mirror is by a brand called simple human
and they're very pricey but you can get
them at Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond and you know
if you have a Bed Bath and Beyond they
constantly have coupons for 20% off so I
recommend getting it then
so overall first impressions of this
palette just using the few shades that
I've done it's pretty nice I'm charged
to play with it a little bit more am i
blown away by it no it is a 13 dollar
palette and it performs like a 13 dollar
palette maybe a little better than the
13 dollar palette I like to look and how
it came out but it's definitely not blow
my socks off if you know what I mean
I like the shadow shield the shadow
shield was cool how it made that little
line there I like that a lot
ooh this is creasing a little bit the
concealers creasing I try to blend that
out a little bit ooh that's not good
maybe this won't work oh no no I'm in a
situation okay there we go it's working
now I'm going to put another shadow
shield on because I really liked how
that came out on the one side and I want
to match I was going to do no shadow
shield so you could see the fallout but
I want to match there we go oh my
phone's ringing hello
hi Erica I'm in the middle of filming a
video it's Erica Vieira from beauty in
the vlog I'm going to put you on speaker
real quick hi Erica
hey hey I'm filming a video I'll call on
habbaniyah I'm doing a getting ready
with me with products I've never tried
on camera oh that's a good one so so
it's not know if you don't know Erica
Vieira she runs a podcast called beauty
in the vlog what's the deal with beauty
in the vlog Erica
Sabrina's blog is a podcast where I
interview youtubers Jen was one of my
guest and that does became good friends
but I have over Nene I was done to this
point and we focus on starting a YouTube
channel building a YouTube channel
starting a blog building a blog stone
all about how to grow and influencer and
who are some of the people you have
interviewed that they may know oh gosh
so I actually I just took coffee break
with Danny on SM lxo genoise Christmas
cookies Amanda and sting yeah they're
there a lot and every topic every person
is different so you learn different
things from each person so you can
listen to all 80 I learned something new
in each episode it's amazing so so Erica
I'm going to let you go I'm going to
call you back as soon as I'm done with
this video
all right I'll talk to you later okay
all right bye still have an idiot aren't
- bye yes sooner I haven't talked to her
in forever so like on the phone we
touched a little bit but I'm talk to her
forever so one is difficult
the next thing I'm gonna be using is the
man-eater eyeliner I have really been
loving this because it does not seep
into my fine lines but I think it was
clawed at one of my subscribers who is
amazing I think she's the one that told
me that it does deep into her fine lines
I'm pretty sure before that I could be
wrong there but it does keep into her
fine line so I don't know why it's not
working for her but it works great for
me maybe she has like deeper set
wrinkles in her eyes and I do or
something I don't know but I absolutely
love how black it is how easy it is bill
on the point is amazing
I'm not going to do a wing because it's
too hard to do a wing holding a mirror
at the same time as you may know I I
just recently finally hit 75,000
subscribers after five years and I'm
very excited about that
milestone I think that it's it's been a
long time coming and I'm very very proud
of it but one thing that's happening is
I am getting more new people to the
channel that don't necessarily get me or
get our community or get what this
channel is about so there's been a lot
more negative comments so what I want to
ask of you is to try to teach these new
people that we are not a negative blaze
and try to help them to be more positive
by responding in a positive way to them
because I'm starting to see subscribers
that I know and love
fighting back against these new people
and instead showing them love I feel
like would be better or ignoring them
because I don't want my comment section
to turn into a negative place like I'm
getting more people talking to me in the
third person like she this and she that
and this girl this and this girl that
and it's like eh they don't know that I
read my comments you know they're used
to these huge youtubers who don't
respond the comments and they're they're
just not used to it so I want to show
them as much love as possible so
anything you do to help me out with that
that would be awesome I have responded
negatively to a few people recently
because I was just was grumpy and I was
like oh hey don't don't this girl me
don't dis girl me because this girl's
reading right now you're not being very
nice this is the arguing where mascara
by Physicians Formula gorgeous packaging
this is brand new I've never used this I
just opened this up and saw the bristles
on it and I'm a little bit nervous
because this does not look functional at
all and it smells oh my gosh it smells
ah getting it close to my nose I don't
even need to get it close to my nose if
your senses the sense do yourself a
favor do not buy this mascara and the
more I'm looking at this the less
unimpressed with this eyeshadow
it just doesn't have the punch that I
personally like in eyeshadow palettes
it's kind of dull and the only shade I
really like is that that lid shade the
one that's the top one over way over on
the right that one I really like but the
rest of them are kind of falling flat
for me right now kind of bummed about
that it's a nice light look but I like
my eyeshadow punchy but if you like
light looks you might like it this
mascara is coloring my lashes and not
doing much else I'm finding that I the
more I use false lashes the less real
lashes I have I think I'm accidentally
pulling out some of my real lashes when
I use the false ones oh my gosh the
scent of this is so strong oh my gosh
it's horrible not an unpleasant set it's
just really strong and I'm not enjoying
it it's really perfu me smelling it must
be trying to cover something up because
that smells awful and the performance of
it is very mediocre it's lengthening a
little bit volumizing a little bit but
it's definitely not going to be a
recommend from first impression ah it's
very pretty though it's a nice thing to
like sit on your shelf but hmm I don't
like that at all very weak weak
performance we're glad sell your work
I'm going to use a little bit of this
eyeshadow as a lower lash line eyeliner
another thing I wanted to address is
that I've been really soft in my reviews
and I think that what's happening is
that people are not understanding where
I'm coming from I'm not quite as brutal
as I used to be and part of that is
because I read the comments of my videos
so for example like with this particular
palette is it punchy enough for me
no absolutely not but that doesn't mean
that that's something you won't like so
I try not to push my viewpoints on other
people because I don't think that it's
enough for me I'm not going to sit here
and say that it sucks you know what I
mean because that might be what you like
as a person is a lighter eyeshadow look
so I'm just going to present it to you
and give my opinion that it's not enough
for me but I am going to say hey if you
like a lighter look it may work for you
even though I'm not the biggest fan of
it you
I mean so people have been interpreting
that is me being weak and soft and I'm
not I think it's just because people
don't get it and you know it's usually
people that are like makeup connoisseurs
like I am you know people that just eat
makeup for lunch you know not literally
but figuratively and you just have to
understand it there's all different
kinds of makeup lovers out there and
some people like things that are less
pigmented some people like things that
are you know I don't know but just know
that it's not that I'm being weak on it
it's just that I'm trying to think about
people have lots of different
preferences you know what I mean we're
going to go ahead into blush now this is
a blush by a brand called Blackbird
cosmetics it is an indie brand the blush
is called sleepyhead and that's like a
purpley shape that's why I figured it
would be nice for with this eyeshadow
palette it's like a purpley multicolor I
don't know if you can see that but it's
beautiful it is a mineral one so some
people don't like mineral blushes
because they're they're a little bit
messy but I personally don't have a
problem with them at all so I'm going to
just go ahead and apply it with this
highlighter brush because that's what I
have in front of me
and you know people people sometimes get
really picky about using this brush for
this and this brush for that but I feel
like it's you have to use whatever works
for you you know I'm not sure if I like
that on me it's a little bit too purpley
those it kind of washes me out a little
bit
I don't know mmm I'm not sure about that
shade on me I would imagine it would
look really nice and someone with a
super cool skin tone oh my gosh here's
another thing I wanted to mention to you
so I've been getting comments that are
constructive criticism and I want to let
you guys know that I totally welcome
constructive criticism like when I was
talking about the lunatic labs contour
palette a lot of people were upset
because I said that the gray shades like
could not be used on a human or whatever
because they were gray contour shades
until we're really upset about that
because they loved those great contour
shades because they're either very pale
or very very cool and that was just my
ignorance that was me being ignorant and
I really appreciated people correcting
me on that and not being afraid to tell
me that I was wrong so please continue
to educate me because I feel like that's
the only way for me to get better
at what I do is to be educated and we
are the collective brain of make of
Awesomeness you know that's what we do
is we teach each other things so please
continue to teach me things because I'd
love to learn from you so don't stop
that next up for highlighter I wanted to
use this this is the Pat McGrath astral
white pigment I wanted to try it as a
highlighter I've used it on my eyes and
I really really liked it but I haven't
tried it as a highlighter I thought it
would be fun that is glitter city that
is very nice and iridescent not
holographic but iridescent that was
another thing whoa that actually looks
really pretty with that blush this is
very costumey looking but it's fun
remember we're just playing today this
is not supposed to be the most serious
makeup tutorial ever that is glitter
that is glitter all my face it's pretty
though it's really neat I think this is
still available the Pat McGrath lab
stuff but I wish they'd sold the stuff
as individuals and not just as set next
up is a product from Heidi D I got this
at I'm at the people at Heidi D we're
climbing up to it give me this and this
is her contour kit and I've really been
enjoying this but I haven't showed it on
camera yet so it looks like that on the
inside and it says your hashtag contour
is on point today on the bottom which is
super cool it's a little bit warm toned
a little bit not bad this is a fun log
I'm enjoying this this is very fun let
me try to blend it out with my finger a
little bit they don't want it to go
lower and then we're going to use a
little bit object this is the silk
natural tinted blur finishing powder I'm
going to use just a little bit of that
all over my face I'm just going to use
this fan brush because it's kind of a
small pot and I don't want to use a big
brush with a small pop because then I'll
make a mess
I like it it's not my favorite but I
like it I like the bareMinerals better
I'm going to try this lipstick this is
the anti socialite matte lip color by
sugarpill that I bought it I'm at I
haven't tried yet I'm excited I should
use a lip liner but yeah I just wanna
try it it's very warm for my eyes
application so let's go down there we go
takes a little bit of building I should
have used a lip line art suddenly
doesn't match my outfit I got this like
girly outfit and this dark lipstick and
this glow and this is just a crazy look
but his mom is playing I love just
playing with makeup sometimes I feel
like people think makeup way too
seriously you know like like your
contour doesn't look good and your your
eyeshadow doesn't match your lipstick
and blah blah it's just makeup people
just have fun with it let's enjoy let's
just let's wear a dark lipstick or a
bright eyeshadow and just have fun you
know pick up my son from the bus stop in
legs look crazy but that's okay I go
with it that's a fun look I like the way
it came out I'm happy with it it's a
little weird but you know it's good oh
now look at my shirt my shirt is like
covered in chowder here went went went
went man one more thing that I've been
getting questions about lately is
whether I regret quitting teaching and I
don't regret it at all except for when
those days that I missed the kids those
days when I talked to an old co-worker
and they say so-and-so told me to tell
you that she or he said hi and I missed
the kids terribly and I miss my friends
that I got to see every day I missed
them terribly but I really don't miss
the job and I have absolutely loved
doing YouTube full-time this year I feel
like my content is ten times better than
it was I feel like I'm putting out
really good stuff I'm putting out things
that I'm super happy with and I love my
youtube channel I it makes me so happy
that I've created this YouTube channel
and this community
that it just I have so much pride in
that and I feel like I'm doing a good
job and I feel like I'm helping people
and I love talking to people in the
comments and this is the best job I ever
had in my life even though you know at
do I have a million subscribers you know
does does that really matter in the
grand scheme of things no I'm having fun
and enjoying my life and that's why I
quit my job so how can I say that I
regret it I'd really like to do a
full-on Q&amp;amp;A sometime soon
so if you have any questions for me
anything that you want to answer ask me
personally about myself or if there's
anything that you want to know make up
