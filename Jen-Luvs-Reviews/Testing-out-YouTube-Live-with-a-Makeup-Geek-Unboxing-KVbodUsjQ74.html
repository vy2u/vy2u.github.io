about I think I might wear this one all
over my lid today I just want to snack
that all over my lid simplehuman
nightmare oh no yeah my mirror keeps
going off but we'll see what happens is
my first day using it my friend Erica
over beauty in the vlog if you like
podcasts ghosts I'll listen and
subscribe to beauty in the blog she had
one when I stayed at her house in Los
Angeles and I fell in love with it so
all right so this last one is called
starry eyed and I want to switch that
baby hey we're gonna swatch it like that
Oh chunk chunk a dog chunka donk donk
that's so pretty it's very soft the
texture reminds me a lot of the color
rain eyeshadows that were in the Queen
of Hearts palette it's got that
smoothness to it i wonder what the
ingredients are hey Ricky ok so we're
going to swatch it e swatch this one
seems definitely seems a little little
chunkier but oh my gosh hmm well maybe
I'm gonna put that when all over my lid
I don't even know which one which one
should I put on my face today Oh bye
Jenelle but oh and then there's the
highlighters boom and there's I shadows
boom if they were these were not ten
dollars apiece I would have bought more
but ten dollars for a single eyeshadow
is a lot for me so I don't buy that many
because that seems like a while but yes
I'm really excited about this makeup
geek stuff i am going to pop over to
periscope now and i'm going to get ready
if you want to join me for getting ready
you can join you over on periscope it is
a twitter company so it um you just go
and download it and then it connects
with your twitter so hey Sheree Joe is
here hi Jocelyn sure he chose a great
YouTube channel by the way I just picked
up the mega Pete captain lights
highlighter and I'm in love yes nice
well I you know I decided not to get the
palette I wanted to get individuals for
prices the foiled brush was eight
dollars and fifty cents each I shado-pan
is ten dollars and then the set of three
was forty dollars and that was on sale
that was twenty-five percent off the
forty dollars there so I'm gonna go
ahead and pop off of here and go over to
periscope so you can feel free to join
me over there if you like it is a great
deal for the brushes and it's very nice
any makeup geek is relatively reasonably
priced especially her regular single
eyeshadow pions especially for the
quality of what they are so i'm gonna
pop over there and get ready and i will
see you guys in chat on sunday well i'll
see you first and what's up in makeup on
Sunday morning and then after that at
ten o'clock we're going to do a
decluttering of my lipstick collection
which I'm really excited about so
hopefully I will see you at ten am on
YouTube for the chat yes keep that light
on it was great to see you guys too hope
you enjoyed this impromptu Facebook live
I don't know if I'm gonna do more of
them or not I haven't decided yet but we
will see you can watch on the replay
Jerry Lynn it's okay it's caught it's on
the replay it should pose to the channel
so Rebecca says the golden pink
highlighter and that pink sunset you got
I'm pretty sure the same and two and the
palate are they really oh that's good to
know all right you guys have a great
rest of your day I will see you very
very soon mad love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
