what's up in makeup I am just set up to
film what's up in makeup and I figured
while I'm already set up and I got my
hair done and I got my makeup done I
might as well film this video because we
are about to hit 10 million views on my
youtube channel it has been such an
exciting and fun ride with you reviewing
products trying out different ideas for
different series on the channel some of
them failing miserably some of they're
doing really really well like what's up
and makeup and the makeup minute and you
know going into more depth and to review
some of you have been with me since I
was filming out on my porch with cars
driving by and little tiny children
coming up to me and sitting on my lap I
really appreciate you all so much for
being here for me not just on YouTube
but on Instagram in the Facebook group
my parallels on periscope I love you so
much it gets me all choked up thinking
about them a pair of loves I love you
guys so much and I I just I appreciate
you all watching my videos it really
means so much to me because it means
that I can do what I love and create and
know that it's going to a place where
it's helpful for someone even if it's
just one person that it's helpful for
like that's what really means the most
to me is that I'm helping you with
something I might be saving you time or
saving you money and that is my goal for
this YouTube channel and I just
appreciate you being a part of it and I
appreciate you clicking that watch
button when my videos go live I mean
some people even say that there would be
in the middle of doing something else
they'll see one of my videos go live
they'll stop everything they're doing
and they'll watch my video and it's like
oh my gosh that just means so much to me
and when people say they wake up on
Sunday mornings they get their cup of
coffee
they tell their husbands and their
children I'm watching the news and they
watch what's up in makeup it's like
those are the stories that that really
touched my heart and I just thank you so
much for being here whether you've been
here for a long time or if you're a
brand new subscriber I appreciate you so
I've been saving up stuff for a giveaway
for a really long time I don't get a lot
of PR but when I do I want to make sure
that I'm using my PR responsibly making
sure I keep things packaged that
I know I won't use so that I can use
them for a future giveaway when I do use
things I do have places where they are
donated to but everything you're gonna
see in this giveaway is a brand new
never been used product now this
giveaway is of course going to be a
little bit different because I can't do
anything normal on this channel I can't
do anything the typical way this is
gonna be different because my biggest
it's my biggest fear for giveaways like
this is that I will send out a huge box
of stuff to someone and they will only
like half of it you know and then
they'll end up giving everything away I
want you to love everything you win in
this giveaway because you haven't won
yet this is what you need to do you need
to be subscribed to my youtube channel
if you're not subscribed you're not
eligible because this is a giveaway for
my subscribers you need to leave a
comment down below of your favorite
product that you saw that I'm going to
show you what would you be most excited
to win that's all you need to do at this
point okay but if you win this is how
it's going to work I'm labeling each of
the items number one through number 15
you are going to pick your top 20 things
that you want then you are going to get
a box of ten things that you enjoy from
that list of 20 you're gonna list them
in order of the thing you want the most
down to the thing you want the least so
it'll be like a mystery box of goodies
when I did my big decluttering I tried
this out with my reporters and they
absolutely loved it because they got a
bunch of stuff that they really wanted
so now let me show you the fifty items
that we are going to be doing for
giveaway now again you don't need to
comment anything down below but the one
thing you would like to win the most and
you need to be subscribed to the channel
don't worry about picking your top 20
things yet that's only if you win and
we'll talk about through email and we'll
make sure that you know exactly what you
need to do so anyway so the first thing
is this Luxy brush set it is cruelty
free brushes and they're all the boxes a
little janky because it's been sitting

good they're not fabulous they're not
like mind-blowing lip glosses but
they're good lip glosses this one is
this is a liquid lipstick this is in
hemp I really like this one as its
hopper for other lipsticks that are too
dark it's a nice way to kind of change
the tone of a lipstick to make it a
little bit lighter if you look out and
go oh my goal so I can't wear that dark

that and then this is another one this
