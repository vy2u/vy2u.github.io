favorites video I am so excited to shoot
this for you I have been waiting to
shoot this for a long time I had some
illness in December couldn't get to it
so now I'm finally getting you my
favorites if you haven't seen my worst
fails of 2014 video i will link that
down below that went up not too long ago
but this is going to be all positive
that one was all the and then this one's
all the good style nation of the year
the hourglass immaculate liquid to
powder foundation mattifying foundation
i'm going to get some drug store stuff
in a second so hang in there with me
okay but i could not i could not put
those above this this stuff is amazing i
just talked about this in my winter
favorites video well it was like my
seasonal favorites i do it at the
beginning of every season and this was
in that as well and i go into kind of
detail about this but basically the the
reason why i love this is because of the
liquid to powder aspect of it where it's
just really fun to play with where when
you put it on your face it automatically
turns into a powder and it feels really
good lasting powers good coverage is
about medium though so if you like a
really full coverage foundation this one
is not going to be for you but if you
like just like a medium coverage
foundation it's really really nice my
only other complaint about this is the
color range isn't fantastic I did not
get my exact skin tone so I have to mix
it a bit but I still feel like I get the
effects of it so I'm very very happy
with this foundation but it is a bit
pricey so let's show you some ones that
I also absolutely loved this year
there's two of them I have a BB cream
and a CC cream I didn't find a
straight-up foundation from the
drugstore that I loved but I did love
these two this is the Garnier BB cream
skin renew and I have the combination to
oily and this is in like medium I love
this I'll call it a foundation because
it's very medium to full coverage I mean
it's got a really really nice coverage
on it I was very surprised I love the
way it goes on so smoothly on my skin
not streaky at all lasting powers
fantastic do you need to use a powder
but I mean most products like this you
do need to use a powder so I'm not
complaining about that this stuff is
phenomenal
with that is the looming time free CC
anti-aging color correcting cream and
medium and I'm not sure if this was a
full size or not because I did get this
in a new Beauty test tube I believe but
this stuff is also stinking amazing this
has a little more coverage than this but
very similar and how they work just
really really nice nice quality skin
perfecting whatever you want to call cuz
I'm not going to call it a foundation
it's a CC cream I didn't see I haven't
seen any anti-aging benefits in these
both have SPF 20 in them which is
phenomenal love love love when my face
products already have SPF in them but
this I mean just very high quality
products let's go ahead and move on so
oh I meant to start with primers and I
didn't so let's rewind to primers I
primer Urban Decay eyeshadow anti-aging
primer I swear this really does have
anti agent stuff when I use this stuff
Rick regularly every day I do see
reduction in fine lines on the lids and
I am not even kidding i am shocked
because very rarely do i see any kind of
anti-aging like line reducing anything
in any product even eye creams I very
rarely see any kind of difference but I
do see a little bit of difference in
this are all my fine lines go on
absolutely not is my skin perfectly
taught absolutely not but I do see a
difference when I use this so this is a
huge thumbs up also it makes my
eyeshadow stay on longer it makes colors
more vibrant all those wonderful things
that you'll find in Urban Decay primer
potion but i will never i don't think
i'll ever purchase one of the other ones
ever again i think i'm always going to
purchase the anti-aging s primer the
Smashbox photo finish foundation primer
this is the pore minimizing one the
stuff is amazing makes your skin just
look so flawless and perfect fills in
pores so so nicely and I absolutely love
it I know it looks like it's purple but
when it comes out it is not purple it is
it is regular like light peachy kind of
color but I mean it blends right in I
mean it's it's got that powdery feeling
when you when you rub it in it just feel
so nice doesn't feel super silicone e or
oily or anything it just feels fantastic
so definitely recommend that this is my
favorite face powder of the year but you
can't find this anywhere so I'm only
going to spend a very short amount of
time on it this is the makeup helper and
this is called the perfect makeup
solution
and there's no shade on here and all
this is a Korean product I got in the
meanie box it is the best face powder
I've ever used but I can't find it on
sale anywhere but I had to mention it
because it is my favorite but I'm not
going to spend any more time on it
because it is not available anywhere
that I can find and this was called the
original packed but that's the only
information i have as far as shade goes
let's moving on to blush my favorite
blush of the year is one that I was very
surprised with my favorite blush and
it's by Eve pearl and I got it i'm at
sin in april and this is in sweet cheeks
light and what they do with their are
their products is they go by your skin
tone there is a mirror here they go by
your skin tone and then what you so what
you do is you take their fan brush and
you run it side to side through the
products and then you sweep it on and
it's just an absolutely beautiful very
natural looking blush I also love using
these separately sometimes I'll run it
this way I'll use this kind of in the
middle I'll use this on the bottom and
then this on the top and it kind of
provides a little bit of a contour
situation going on and it's really just
a really fun blush to play with I
absolutely love it and definite big
thumbs up on that keeping with cheek
products i'm sorry i'm in the high-end
land right now i'm going to go back to
drugstore a minute I promise okay
favorite highlight of the year I can't
help it it's true I'm not going to say a
drugstore product is my favorite if it's
not and this is my favorite highlight of
the year and it's the hourglass ambient
lighting palette and specifically the
one that I love is the center one which
is the incandescent light the other ones
are ok this one I over here I don't use
much that one is a dim light radiant
light I like as well but my favorite by
far is the incandescent lights just an
absolutely gorgeous highlight and I love
it it's beautiful I especially love it
for filming it looks gorgeous in
pictures and it's just it's my favorite
I forgot my concealer yeah I have a
drugstore one for you ok concealer I
know that this is an older product but I
just discovered it this year so for me
accounts for this year the instant age
rewind eraser for dark circles and I
absolutely love this concealer it covers
my dark circles it does what it's
supposed to do there's no creasing it
lasts all day I absolutely love this
product how many times can I say
absolutely love something I do though I
do it's it's a wonderful concealer and
it's my favorite all right going back
into high-end land sorry I have to do it
okay favorite pallets of the year I have
to okay and these are the two the lorac
pro 2 I have absolutely love now the
only reason why the mega Pro isn't in
here is because the mega Pro is not
accessible I hate hated the way lorac
released it it makes me mad so I'm not
putting in there but I can't resist
putting the pro 2 in here the shadows
are fantastic quality they're so easy to
blend so easy to work with really fun i
love that there's the mat ro and the
shimmer oh the shimmer road does not
have a lot of fallout it's just so it's
a wonderful wonderful palette and I do
have a full review on this that I can
link down below for you but amazing
palette one that I have not talked about
much that I don't feel like has got
enough love on YouTube is the Stila eyes
are the window series this is the eyes
are the window to the spirit palette and
I know it's going to give this weird
glare on here but this is kind of steel
as best of palette you have all of
steelers most popular shades in this one
palette and I don't know why no one
talks about this it's phenomenal the
shadows here I mean just buttery and
fantastic we'll do one of these over
here I mean just such a fun palette to
play with I mean just I don't I don't
know why no one talks about it I mean
you get kitten in here you get wheat you
get shenoy you get slate espresso um you
know Jezebel I mean all these famous
cielo shadows are all in this one
palette Bam Bam Bam Bam just like what
what what seriously a museum in what
they're just amazing they're they're the
most beautiful beautiful shadows I just
it baffles me no one talks about this
palette but it's amazing if you can get
your hands on it I strongly recommend it
all right Oh another cheap product i
forgot to mention that i actually
haven't showed you all that I have it
yet is this Smashbox contour palette I
really like this a lot it has been
really fun to play with since i bought
it i do show this shade the most loved
this one I feel like isn't really a
highlight as much well it depends on
your skin tone whether this is going to
be a highlight for you this is not a
highlight for me it's more of like a
powder like it doesn't really there's no
shimmer to it so to me that's not a
highlight for me but if you're of a
deeper skin tone you'll probably like
that more I feel like that this palette
is going to be nice for a lot of
different skin tones this is your warmer
color this is your cooler color so
depending on your skin tone I like the
cooler one better so I've been using
that one specifically a lot but this has
been really fun to play with I do use
this one some but I like this shade
especially so this is my bronzer a
highlighter alat of the year so the next
products have to do with me trying to
improve the growth of my facial hair I'm
just saying these are lash and brow
serums rapid lash i discovered rapid
last this year thanks to my friend erica
over it from brains to beauty she raved
about this when it went on hautelook on
sale I bought it and I've been hooked on
it ever since my lashes I'm not even
kidding have probably doubled in size
since i started using this I'm not even
exaggerating the stuff is amazing I know
there's some other products they're
similar that are on the market that are
also wonderful but this is the one I've
been using and it has been fantastic for
me now what I did get this one this is
by mychelle derma suitable and it's
called the ultimate lash and brow serum
believe it or not this actually has more
product in it than this if you would
believe it it's just the packaging this
one has a tube that goes straight down
and this one is you know actually has
some space in it I got this in a using
box and I'm so so thankful I do have
some spaces in my brows here that drive
me bonkers and I stopped using my
michelle derma suta goals serum for a
while and i noticed those spaces got
ridiculously big compared when i was
using it it was like oh this is what my
brows used to look like before
started using it I better start using it
again so since then I have been using
this religiously and I'm so thankful to
have it it just makes my whole brow
routine goes so much faster to not have
to fill in that space so much and I've
been strictly using this on my brows
this on my lashes but you can do both
for either one it doesn't matter I'm
pretty sure my shell dimmer suitable is
a natural one and then this one I'm not
sure so if that stuff matters to you you
may want to go with this and this
actually has more in it than that's like
I said a minute ago while we're talking
about lashes let's talk about mascaras
and I actually don't have a high end
favorite mascara because I don't feel
like my high-end mascaras beat these
enough in order to pay double the price
these are my two favorite mascaras of
the year and I'm like getting chills
because I just love these products so
much it's just like makes me so happy
this was sent to me by the beautiful and
fantastic Victoria jonnelda for our $20
makeup challenge swap and this is the
Jordana bash last best lash extreme
mascara and it looks very ordinary I did
just talk about this and my my winter
favorite to my seasonal favorites video
it looks very ordinary when it comes to
the wand there but I'm telling you it is
extraordinary it is about I think it's
three dollars for this mascara and I'm
talking about length I'm talking about
volume I'm talking about everything
magical you can possibly have with a
mascara it is not difficult to remove it
doesn't run down my face there's no
flaking I mean this is an amazing
mascara this one on the other hand this
one I actually think I like as far as
the effect just a little bit more this I
threw away the one that I had used I
have this as a backup from whenever
whenever I'm feeling a little frisky and
want to try this again I did by backup
of it and I rarely buy a second of the
same mascara because I've so many deluxe
I samples so that just speaks volumes to
this mascara haha see how I did that
reason why I think this one for me
personally tops this one is because of
the separation of the lashes I don't
like my lashes to clump together I do
not like that look on me at all so I
feel like this one does a better job
than this one I feel like the
lengthening is about the same the
volumizing is it got the same but I feel
like this one is a little harder to get
off than this one it's
not super hard to get off but it's a
little harder to get off than this one
so it's kind of a trade off from me the
positives of this outweigh the negatives
on it so that's why this is actually my
favorite but this one is so good i had
to mention them both because they have
positives that may be more positive for
you if that makes products favorite lip
products of the year are the two face la
crema lipsticks i love these things they
are just so moisturizing and just so
phenomenal I just I love the formula I
have this one and naughty nude not a
it's so naughty and it's just a basic
new let's say where can I put this so
there's naughty nude and then this one
is my actual favorite this one is in
pink chocolate and it on the website it
looks like it's brown but it's not brown
it's this beautiful berry color it's
very close to that marsala that Pantone
color of the year for 2015 I would say
it's very close to that so if you're
going for that I would definitely
recommend the pink chocolate two-faced
um look round lipstick these these are
just they're just so moisturizing and i
love the very subtle shine that they
give my lips they just feel good this
smell is extremely i just got lipstick
on my nose well thanks i hope not but
the snow is very very subtle it's got a
very subtle vanilla smell but it's so
super subtle if your senses it should
not bother you but highly recommend this
formula this is my favorite formula of
2014 will perfume and then nail polish
and then we're done I'm zipping through
this girlfriend's unzip and through okay
favorite perfume of the year is
rihanna's noon I love this perfume it
just it has such a fresh like citrusy
vanilla kind of smell it's perfect for
daytime everyday wearable it's not
obnoxious in any way it's just got a
really nice feminine girly scent and I
want this stuff it's just it's my
favorite it's fresh and clean but not
too floral not too dry and it's not too
fruity either it's not too young or
mature but it's just the perfect set for
me and I'm just in love with this and
this is the smaller size I got this in a
gift set with two others by her but mmm
definitely my favorite favorite actual
individual nail polish of the year is
bold gold by Maybelline Color show this
is an amazing nail polish very chip
resistance it takes a nail polishes
typically last about two days without a
chip for me nail polish is not last long
for me this one will last me about three
to four days and just the color on this
it looks like you got you know those
those metal nails that people are
wearing their really trendy it looks
like you got one of those on unit that I
mean it's like straight metal it's
amazing the other thing I love about
this nail polishes it's great for nail
art I just got into nail stamping
because I got a Stamper for Christmas
and I'm so excited and I think my
glorious husband for buying it for me my
very first time i used my nails stamper
i use this color and it came out perfect
like it just it worked beautifully for
stamping because it's not it's not real
it's nice and thick but it's not so
thick that it goes on streaky you know
what I'm saying but perfect perfect
perfect gold right here as far as my
favorite formula of 2014 was the julep
silk finish nail polishes I do have
three i think i might have four but
these were the three that i could find
and i'll show you a my swag though I
accidentally I had two and then I found
a third one but let me show you how
those look it's these three right here
so you can see that it's got the satiny
kind of finish and it's just absolutely
beautiful on the nail this one here is
called Abigail this one here is called
Noel and this one here is called Shannon
and they had released that first from
Saint Patrick's Day this year so if you
can find this formula from julep I
highly recommended it's just beautiful
lasting power is pretty typical on me
maybe two to three days it lasting power
for julep nail polishes is not
phenomenal for me it's just kind of
regular I like to put some kind of
pizzazz on my nails but when i wear the
silk finish nail polishes I just let
them be because they're just so
beautiful just on their own so
that it did I get through everything I
think I did that's it that's my
favorites for 2014 all of the best
things that I personally experienced
this year I would love to know what your
favorite things were this year in the
