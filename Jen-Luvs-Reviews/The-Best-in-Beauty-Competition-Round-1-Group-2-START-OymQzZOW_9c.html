best in beauty competition I'm pearls

watching the best been meeting hostage
hi this is Laura from mrs. Bolin and
welcome to the best in beauty
competition I'll be in the video buddy
yeah there you are hi hello my friends
welcome to round 1 group 2 of the best
in beauty competition but before we get
on to round 1 group 2 I want to just say
how sad I am to see Alana go Alana has
been one of my favorite subscriptions
I'm not even kidding pretty much since i
started my beauty channel so i just
adore her and if you haven't seen her
channel yet I highly recommeded she is
hilarious please don't camera little do
for all the people they were competing
last week are not competing this week we
have six brand new people contesting and
I'm good testing we have six brand new
people competing this week and I'm going
to show you them right now
those are the six people that will be
completing this week and this is what
you're gonna do my friend check out the
links at the contestants a lot of them
are putting them as the video response
down below does you'll only be able to
see two of them but if you click where
it says video responses you'll be able
to see all their videos also i just put
links to their videos in that little
clip i just showed so if you click on
their faces up take you directly to
their competition video once you have
watched the videos or at least as much
video as you realize who is awesome and
who you want to vote for you're going to
vote down in the comments below my video
so you can vote for the same as last
week up to three people pay you're not
going to vote for the same person three
times because that doesn't encourage you
to go watch new people because chances
are a lot of you are coming to this
video because someone you're subscribed
to has sent you so if that's true I
highly suggest you check out some of the
other videos and vote for them as well
because you have up to three votes
you're gonna put one comment below
you're going to pick up to three people
either one person two people or three
people to write their names in the
comments and then you're done that's it
voting will end this friday at eleven
fifty-nine p.m. eastern standard time
it's too crazy to say midnight because
then what do you say you say saturday
morning just a friday night because if
you say saturday morning then that's too
confusing if you say friday night then
it's not really true so we're going to
say 1159 right this friday night if you
want to be a part of this competition
you absolutely can create an intro for
the competition you saw earlier in the
video a bunch of wonderful video
creators some with lots of subscribers
some with very few subscribers it
doesn't matter this is about the beauty
community
and it and nobody is higher than anybody
else you know what I'm saying so if you
want to be a part of it you can be a
part of it all you got to do is shoot a
quick video welcoming people to the best
of beauty competition send it to me in
an email at the file sizes too big
you're going to go to we transfer com

a link and it will be in a video so make
sure you share this on your social media

talent a lot of classic channels a lot
of neat personalities I think you will
