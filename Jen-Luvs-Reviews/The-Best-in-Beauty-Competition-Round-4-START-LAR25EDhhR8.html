point in the competition it's very
exciting we have six fantastic amazing I
have no word but as always before we
talk about the next round I want to talk
about what happened in the previous
round we cut out to people this week
because we join the two groups so
instead of having half the ladies with
one cut and half ladies one cut now
they're both together so now we have to
cut from the one you know what I'm
saying and unfortunately we cut cat and
Amelia that was what your votes chose to
do I don't know if I would have made the
same choices but you know I mean that's
what you guys decided to do every vote
counted I'm not even kidding if you
watch the results video that bottom row
those bottom four people were like
flipping back and forth that was insane
they were tied and they were flipping
they were all over the place and cat
didn't drop into the bottom two until
like the last 20 or 30 votes she was
like up in the top 4 for like ever and
then I was on she just dropped straight
down it was crazy I couldn't even
believe it so just a little bit about
cat and Amelia cat is amazing she is
very good about putting up consistent
videos she does amazing tutorials halls
and and reviews or reviews are very in
depth and thorough and wonderful and
she's just she's amazing she's awesome
now Amelia I don't even know what say
about my girl Amelia miss amelia is one
of my keep friends I adore Amelia she is
such a sweetheart she is a fantastic
makeup artist she puts out wonderful
