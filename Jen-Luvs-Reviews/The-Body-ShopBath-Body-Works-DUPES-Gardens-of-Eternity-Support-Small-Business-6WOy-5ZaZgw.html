products from gardens the tournament it
just sounds like one of those names that
you just want to say it it just sounds
so epic gardens of eternity enough about
the name the people who created gardens
of eternity products contacted me and
asked me to review some of their
products they said missed me about a
month month and a half ago so I've had
plenty of time to test them and see what
I think of them and overall this is
going to be a very positive review and
just because I got this stuff sent to me
for review has nothing to do with the
way that I am going to review it I told
people straight up the way that I review
which is completely honest and they can
either choose to send it to me or not if
they're not okay with honesty then they
don't send me things but gardens of
eternity is okay with honesty so they
did send me the products for review
first thing that I want to talk about is
the packaging now this is the biggest
negative that I had for the company was
that I did not feel the packaging was of
high quality as far as the labeling goes
the body wash that I got the label
gotten water on it and it's just wearing
down the the ink isn't running it was
not happy with the packaging of that the
packaging on the lip balm is peeling off
overall just not happy with the
packaging so they've actually since I've
made that comment they've actually
changed a lot of their packaging but
they've upgraded their labeling system
and their packaging so that it is of
higher quality so when you see the
packaging just keep that in mind that
the packaging does look different and
they've improved on it so let me just go
ahead and start off with the products
that I got the first one we'll start off
with is this jasmine and grapefruit body
wash and this is a very very refreshing
scent it's very nice for morning showers
to kind of wake you up and the lather is
super nice I like the pump because then
I can get out exactly the amount of
product that I want and snow is just
it's Jasmine great for it it's exactly
what you would imagine that would be but
it's more grapefruit than jasmine just a
really nice refreshing scent next up is
the deodorant body spray and they gave
me the scent strawberries in champagne
you are supposed to shake this before
you use it and I'm telling you I really
really like the stuff I mean to spray it
so you
see how the mess comes out it's very big
mist I mean it reminds me of something
she would get from Victoria's Secret as
far as as far as the way that it feels
it's very light it doesn't feel oily at
all and I decided one day in this hot
Maryland summer heat that I was going to
only use this for my deodorant that I
was not going to use any other deodorant
and this stuff worked I'm not even
kidding like I did not stink all day
this is not an antiperspirant though so
I was sweating my face off like I'm you
mind I was sweating alright
but I didn't stink which was amazing I
think I'm actually gonna put this in my
gym bag to use for that purpose now that
I'm done with testing it for review I
think that's where this is going to
travel soon next up we'll talk about the
Coco mango and this was this is a
handmade detergent free soap gave me the
scent Coco mango and this is kind of the
way that it looks now got a creamy sweet
smell the mango isn't totally
overpowering it's more to me smells with
them more like Coco smells more like
vanilla to me I don't know why but it's
got like that fruity creamy smell and
the lather is really nice on this I love
the way it makes my skin feel um it
definitely leaves me with a moisturize
feeling on my skin it does dry out my
skin just a tiny bit but I feel like
this is more moisturizing than some of
the soaps that I've used in the past
I've really really enjoyed this as well
and this is going to be gone soon next
I'm gonna talk about the let's see this
is the body lotion and this is in the
scent pink sangria and it has aloe
sunflower oil and vitamin E so it is
quite whippy for a lotion it feels like
like almost like Cool Whip as far as the
consistency maybe a little creamier than
Cool Whip and that's the way that looks
and then that's the way that it applies
it just applies so smoothly it's a
really really nice product it almost
isn't really like a lotion I would say
it's more like a body butter but but a
little more lotion II than a body butter
but it seeps into my skin really nicely
it doesn't make my skin feel oily and it
just doesn't feel cheap you know like
some lotions they just feel cheap like
they just feel synthetic and cheap this
one does not feel like that and I really
really enjoyed this and the smell is
just wonderful it's just got a nice like
like a fresh clean
nina sweet smell almost like it should
have like bubbles in it like it's like a
soda or something like so really enjoyed
this and then the last thing i got from
them is the lip balm a give me the one
in strawberry sorbet and it is a vegan
lip balm so if that's something that
you're into then this is vegan my hands
are all slimy now from the lotion i
can't get it open
ah use my shirt okay there we go
okay the number one ingredient this is
ken dealio wax which i don't really know
a lot about and then coconut oil is the
next ingredient but it also has castor
oil and then cocoa butter and then
vitamin E and then flavoring it's got
all the different scents in here there's
peppermint pattie and Lotus and lemon
pound cake funky monkey cucumber and
aloe fresh-cut roses Drakkar Noir which
I remember from the 90s
my very first like love from when I was
12 or whatever used to wear Drakkar
that's what I always think of when I see
that there's one that's based on the
Polo fragrance of Britney Spears based
fragrance vegan lip balm here we go
vegan and gluten-free we use no animal
products and our lip balms and we do not
add sugar key the products ingredients
simple while giving you the best quality
and I do feel like it's very
moisturizing I mean the we're time
wanted it is typical for a lip balm but
I have enjoyed the moisturization of
this product so I would definitely
recommend this one as well and the sense
it's not a super strong scent if you're
getting a lip balm specifically for the
flavor in the scent this one is going to
be too mild for you you can smell it but
it's just super duper uber mild so if
you do like them if you don't like a
strong scent in your lip balm then this
would probably be one that you would
enjoys overall big thumbs up for the
gardens of eternity products I do feel
like they compare and hold up against
Bath and Body Works against Body Shop
against Victoria's Secret products that
I've used I feel like these are
comparable in quality I mean really and
truly I feel like they're comparable in
quality the only thing I felt like was
definitely lacking was the packaging and
it you know getting wet and peeling off
but they're really working to improve
that and they've already improved quite
a lot of that if there is a coupon code
