review on some products that i got from
the born pretty store the born pretty
store is a chinese company that sends
out all kinds of products including a
makeup products i did try to get some
other products and they really wanted me
to review their makeup products so I am
I picked up these makeup items and
looking forward to showing you what
they're like I do have two wins one fail
from this company and the fail for me is
this kabuki brush and i will put all the
information of where i found these items
on their website down below but this
kabuki brush is just way too fluffy uh
what I I feel like when I apply it it
just doesn't really blend the way that I
like a kabuki brush to blend let me show
you a quickie brush that I own okay so
this is the one from everyday minerals
and I love everyday minerals I love
their eyeshadows I love their makeup
brushes so the born pretty one is
definitely bigger but look how dense
that is I don't know if you can see the
difference in the density hopefully you
can see it very very very soft but the
density just isn't there these are much
more compact this as much fluffier so
when I go to blend this gives a much
softer blend so if you're dealing with
really pigmented products you really
need a more dense brush if you're just
trying to kind of even everything out
very gently this one will work falling I
do like the handle on it I like the way
that it grips where it's got this little
I don't know this little like handle
here I like being able to grab it like
that and then use it so it's not a total
bust it's just not my favorite kabuki
brush kabuki brush of all time moving
into the lip product now this is really
interesting this is by hang fang and it
is a color magic lip boom and a lipstick
and as you can see this stuff applies
really really cool where it looks like
it's green but then you put it on and
it's like this bright pink and let me
tell you about this this stuff does not
come off i'll show you swatch on my hand
I don't want to because it's not going
to come off but okay see how it's like
nothing but then it slowly changes color
on my lips it changes immediately I
think it has something to do with the
heat
brightening it's pretty amazing so need
it makes you wonder what chemicals are
in a bit make it to do that but it's a
really cool product and I love the color
and it's in a it stays on all day like
no joke like you cannot get this stuff
off so if you don't like the color you
are just completely insert expletive
here this is definitely a win for me I
really really enjoyed this is
moisturizing has a very very slight
fruity scent but definitely nothing I
even notice on my lips at all just a
really really fun product there the last
product that i got from them is by zini
zoo i think i'm saying that right i'll
put the name down there and it's called
a soft blush and it's a professional
blush and everything else is in another
language some an asian language that i'm
not familiar with if i don't know if
it's chinese or I'm not good at telling
the difference between the characters
but that is the blush there and this is
just a beautiful blush show you finger
swatch there's finger when you see that
lipstick brightening up there is that
there I'll do one more double so you can
see and just really really pretty this
blush has an 8 to 10 hour where which is
really good for a blush and I'm really
really happy with the formula here it
doesn't kick up a ton of powder when you
use it which is nice that you're not
going to make a big mess the lasting
power is nice pigmentation is nice I
have no complaints about this blush at
all another thing with born pretty is
you do have to expect a longer shipping
times who definitely prepare for that
ahead of time last time I did a review
of a company that was I think it was a
Chinese or Korean was a lot of people
asked me if the shipping was really
expensive and I honestly don't know what
the shipping is for born pretty but if I
can find any information it will be in
the downbar below about what they're
shipping charges are because under that
was a huge huge question on the last
video that I did it was similar to this
so those are the three four products
that i got from born pretty again this
one I mean you could do without this is
really fun but make sure you commit to
the color before you put it on and then
this here blush I absolutely loved the
formula on this amazing so thank you so
much for watching if you enjoyed this
video make sure you give it a thumbs up
and makes me look awesome and like you
really like the video if you give it a
thumbs up so I appreciate that and make
sure you subscribe if you're not already

openings things of that nature and if
you like that hang around for the next
