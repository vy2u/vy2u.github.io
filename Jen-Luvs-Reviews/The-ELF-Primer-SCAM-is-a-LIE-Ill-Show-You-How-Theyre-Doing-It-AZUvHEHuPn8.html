controversy about this product over the
weekend it's actually quite an old
controversy there's videos about this
and elf ripping us off with this product
they go back at least three years and
this just seems to pop up every once in
a while on whether this elf primer is
gives you what it says it's supposed to
give you if you look on the box it does
say that it's 0.47 fluid ounces and
there's videos proving that this elf
primer is way less than point four seven
fluid ounces and me being me of course I
had to test it so if that sounds good to
you if you want to see if elf is really
ripping you off let's go ahead and get
into that right now so what I did was I
took my ELF primer and I rinsed it out
it took all the product out because we
want to make sure that we've got the
right amount of fluid ounces in here but
before we put the do the test let me
just show you how the bottle works so
what happens is you open this up and
you've probably seen this in other
videos if you've seen this before
there's a wall here and then there's a
smaller container in here this is where
the product is housed and I think that's
when people kind of get upset about that
there there's this little smaller bottle
in here I do want to show you the
functionality of this and how this
actually works I'm just gonna go ahead
and fill this up completely to the top
with water so the way this type of
bottle works is when you screw the top
on I'm just gonna go ahead and put that
on here I'm making a mess already and
let me actually I'll hold this like this
and hopefully you'll be able to see
what's happening here and as I pump the
product as I pump the water out but
we'll pretend like this is primer you'll
notice that the the stopper inside
slowly moves inward what that's doing is
its pushing the product up so that more
product can be pumped out and as we keep
going the stopper goes further up more
product comes out and eventually gets to
the top and you run out of product so
when you purchase it the stopper is all
the way at the bottom what I've done is
I filled up my cooking little measuring
cup with half an ounce of water I use
this for cooking all the time I find it
to be quite accurate it's kind of the
job of this brand to be accurate in its
way
so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna
gently pour in the product here and
we're gonna see whether it overflows
like we see in a lot of videos and oh
you can overflow rien overflow not even
close because and it's actually going
down to here it's actually not all the
way up so if I take this and I pour this
in a lot it out uh we have half an ounce
of water still so I think what people
are doing in order to scam this test and
I'll show you a clip of somebody's video
right now if you notice he has the
stopper pushed all the way to the top so
if I push the stopper all the way to the
top I'm gonna go ahead and start pouring
this in and what do you notice right
away up it's overflowing oh my gosh of
course it's overflowing the stopper
spotting the way the table if you look
inside here you can see the other little
teeny tiny container that is hidden so
the actual amount I I was flabbergasted
I couldn't even believe it I thought
this is like the height of deception
okay so maybe this is a plastic piece
holding all the makeup except there's no
bottom
now that's overflowing that's over the
top and there's still a ton of water in
here
that's when you're supposed to be out of
product is when the stopper is all the
way at the top like that so I really do
feel like either people just didn't of
course I spilled it of course I did I
always spill everything you know I like
to think of that people are good people
and that they're not lying on purpose so
it's possible that they didn't realize
that the stopper was all the way at the
top when they did the experiment or it's
possible that they were lying and
manipulating for views but but the fact
is elf is not ripping you off with how
much product is in this container and
you can be rest assured that this is
accurate so I want to thank you so much
