two videos in one week say what am i
single without kids again what is going
on here I can't believe it Oh craziness
okay so i got my first video request and
it doesn't matter that's when somebody i
know outside of youtube doesn't matter
that only have nine subscribers I'll get
there I'll get there again I'll get back
up to 3,000 subscribers again i will
i'll get there that'll be the goal ok so
anyway oh alright so i got my first
request for a video and my request was
from my friend kathleen and she said can
you do a tutorial on how you did you
make up in the last video it was like
sure of course on too many on how i did
my makeup basically when we show you is
a natural I that you can do but you can
use any colors you want I'm gonna show
you this in stages now this that I have
on here boo boo boo is the most I shadow
so I'm going to show you how to make it
light and then little darker and then
lil darker and then maybe even a little
darker than that and how to get this
long a big trick to this eyeshadow is
please please this is this is it this is
the thing don't start on your lid too
dark if you have your Christine you are
lucky because you have more options if
you have lighter skin like me you gotta
start off light on your lid because then
you have nowhere to go if you start off
too dark you have nowhere to go and you
gotta like and your I ends up looking
like somebody punched in the face and
it's just not cool so start off really
really let on your lid so you need I
shadow that is one shade lighter than
your skin you need an eyeshadow that is
let the color shades darker for your
crease and they need to I shudder that's
a couple shades darker than that for
your outer corner okay then you might
even want one that's a little bit darker
to even dark enough that our corn just a
little bit more making a little more
smoky smoky like you can you can do this
this is the same routine I do every
single day I just use different colors
so like I already know what i'm doing i
have to work that fumbling around in the
morning
I don't know what I'm feeling you know
oh my god he like I know what I'm doing
I just have to figure out what color
when you use and that really is dictated
by what I'm wearing oh you know be
really pretty do like a light pink or a
light green or a light blue on your lid
then you take like either a brown or or
a like a medium brown or like a medium
gray and that's for your crease and then
a darker Brown darker gray for the outer
corner hot super hot do it do it do it
and when you do it what comment below
tell me you did and how awesome it
wasn't I hope you like it hey here comes
mm-hmm I'm going to use my naked 2
palette but I cannot stress you enough
how you do not need a naked 2 palette to
do this you just need the colors that I
explained as long as you have those
colors and you're good what we want to
do I'm going to go into booty call and i
love these names booty calls this shade
that's a shade dart lighter than my skin
so i'm going to go ahead and just Pat
this with the biggest brush from my
equal to set but you can use any
eyeshadow brush for this it doesn't have
to be anything I just like this one
because it's big and it doesn't take me
that long Boop okay that's done now I'm
going to go in with my angled crease
brush watch how easy this says okay and
I'm going to go in with what did I use I
used ydk which is awesome we show you
awesome so here's booty call yeah
there's booty call there's ydk okay and
then i'm going to go in with my third
color is going to be this one here which
is called busted okay so not necessary
to have naked palette don't worry about
that don't stress out over that it's not
necessary okay so here's my ydk and i'm
going to just kind of open my eye a
little bit and just kind of go back and
forth where my eyeball rounds out
now i'm going to go back with my big big
brush my lid brush and i want to take
busted i'm going to just tap it right in
the corner there and kind of blend it
out just a little bit
list of looks a little chunky but that's
okay because we're going to fix it okay
then i take a fluffy brush and I'm going
to go in with with foxy which is a shade
it's it's still a shade lighter than my
skin but it's important to know that it
shouldn't be shimmer at least in my
opinion I think shimmer up here looks
really really weird so like a matte
shade that's like a shade lighter than
your skin so this is foxy that's a shade
lighter than my skin I'm going to go
boop doop doop just kind of give me a
nice highlight their and blend this
color out boo boo boo okay and then if
you want to end it there you can this is
of course the most mild version so when
it's in person you'll be able to see it
a little more probably than it's showing
on this camera especially since my
camera for some reason is a little bit
yellow I don't know why okay so because
I want to darken a limit I'm going to
take it a step up I'm knees busted and
I'm gonna go in and I'm just going to go
all through it again with busted instead
of just in that corner so you can stop
there if you want to make it that meet
it for the eyeshadow you can stop there
or you can take a step further and I'm
gonna go in with this black called
blackout now be careful with other
brands of black might be a little too
much this brand of black happens to work
really well for um blending so it's fine
for this but you might want to be
careful if you're using a different
brand of black it might not blend is
nicely as this okay and then I'm going
to take my blending brush they dropped
on us again hey my blending brush and
I'm gonna just blend that out a little
bit okay see and now they match woohoo I
always this is something I got into
doing because I feel like it really
makes my eye lashes look fuller as I
take a black cuz my hair is dark I take
a black eyeliner pencil and I'd go like
this on the top of my lid oh I missed ya
if you get this enough it won't be dry
and I'll come right off which is nice
okay sorry I wasn't really looking ok so
I line the water my top waterline and it
makes see how much difference that makes
and then I take this and just kind of
make it in the corner just a little bit
just to kind of make it pop then you get
to kind of play so if you want to keep
going neutral like I did on this I you
can or you can use color um you can use
like green or you can use pink or you
can use any color you want whatever
matches your outfit contrasting colors
with your outfit or complementary in the
contrast and complementary colors with
your outfit um whatever you want um I'm
going with neutral today so I'm not
going to use any of my crazy colors one
of my crazy goes I'm just gonna use my
regular black this is um Urban Decay's
um 24-7 liquid eyeliner in perversion
but again don't need the expensive stuff
you really don't it really don't it's
nice I mean this is a great eye liner
but it's really not necessary um next
makes fabulous fabulous eyeliners and
I'll put the price up I think they're
like three bucks I mean get a next one
next ones are amazing you can get one
okay so let me see I can do this on
camera I've never done my eyeliner on
camera before so hopefully this works
out okay cuz I don't want to start over
cuz this stuff stays on your eye and you
cannot get it off if you mess up all
right I might have to look at a mirror
and just make sure I did that right but
they're just kind of missed the corner a
little bit okay and if you want here if
you want to make it even more dramatic
you can kind of wing it out how do
people do this these tutorials I swear
you kind of wing it out a little bit if
you want I'll wing out the other side
cuz I didn't do that on the other side
OOP hairs in the way I don't want you
know a little bit like I'm feel it there
it is OOP know when you know you want to
point towards your eyebrow when you do
that and then last it's just mascara
oh oh let's do something else let's make
it fun so I wear a white tank top today
so that i could add a pop of color so i
can show you how to add a pop color if
you want to add a pop color again whoo
not have to do this totally optional
okay so one thing you can do and i'm
going to use the smallest brush from my
eco tools i show kit and i'm going to go
in and add a pop of color so i have all
these eyeshadows these are urban decay
from The Book of Shadows three that was
a horrible packaging so I dug them out I
broke some of them in the process but I
dug them out of my of my palette because
it was just a terrible box and then the
rest of these these are makeup geek
eyeshadows makeup geek is a fellow
youtuber so I bought a bunch of her eye
shadows and I love them so i'm gonna go
ahead and I'm gonna use what should we
do today let's use makeup geek which is
green I'm feeling very green let's use
appletini there's appletini and I'm just
going to go in the bottom right here and
just add some bright green to the bottom
just to kind of give it that little bit
of color so that it's not so boring I
never wear new just neutral anymore
because I'm just addicted to color
and there it is i love you can see get
closer well my eyes are huge when i do
