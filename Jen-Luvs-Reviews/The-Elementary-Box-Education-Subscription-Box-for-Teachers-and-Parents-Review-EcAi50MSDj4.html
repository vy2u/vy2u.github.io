review of the elementary box now it's
back-to-school time teachers you're
getting ready to go back to school kids
are getting ready to go back to school
and this is an interesting opportunity
for teachers and parents they're
homeschooling their kids parents that
want to keep their kids updated on
skills that they're learning in school
maybe for some weekend activities every
parent is different on how much they
want their kids to work on things at
home so this is an interesting option to
help children to keep up on their skills
that they're learning in schools so or
for teachers to help to implement things
in their classroom so this is a
subscription and that renews monthly it
is $29 for a month a month and then
three months you get it for $27 a box
and then six months is $25 a box so
let's go ahead and open up this box and
see if we think that it is worth these
subscription price now I if you do not
know I am a well I've been a fourth
grade teacher now I'm going back to my
special education and resource job for
next year I just found out oh my
goodness so I have been teaching this is
I'm going into my 11th year teaching so
I feel like I'm a really good judge of
what would be good in a box when
Elementary Box contacted me and asked me
if I wanted to review a box I thought it
was gonna be teaching fourth grade again
next year so I ordered the fourth grade
box but having taught fourth grade for
the past two years I feel like I can
kind of say whether this is something we
would have used in our classroom so all
right so the first thing that we got in
here was a pack of stickers and this is
a 144 value pack of stickers they say
encouraging words nice great cool super
Wow Bravo terrific good I mean any
teacher is always going to be able to
use stickers for something especially
elementary school teachers oh I forgot
to tell you
they give you a box based on your grade
level so pre-k all the way up through
fifth grade is the boxes that they offer
and let me just see I just want to see
if they were all the same sticker or if
they were different it looks like
they're all the same there are a bunch
of sheets in here that add up to 1144
stickers so that is a good thing to get
definitely useful this is the
information cards of
I miss that it has all of these things
here and the retail price it also has a
book list down at the bottom some great
reads for those first days of school and
those are appropriate for a fourth grade
Pete the cat Pete the cat rocking in my
school shoes I don't think that these
were specifically for fourth grade I
don't not familiar with any of the other
ones on here maybe they just put some of
the just suggestions in general let's
move on to this I this says note from
your teacher and there are some notepads
here that Lopez notepad trying to speak
today what is going on all right so
let's see how this works okay so there
are notepads you get two of them and it
says 10% off your order use code LM LM
Bo X this is a hand stamped note paper
from Etsy and it's simply stamped
invites etsy.com
and these are very very cute and these
will definitely be used these are nice
to put in folders for kids you know kids
have a particularly great day or you
know question for the parent these are
great to put in and I like that they're
generic it just says note from the
teacher I don't know I just I like the
generic ones better than them better
than the specific with like names and
things on them
it's anyway really happy to have those
different designs those are school on
the bottom of this one and then an apple
on the other one says those are cute and
there's plenty of room to write which I
like alright so moving on they're a
bunch of different tubes in here and I
will tell you what these are and the
purpose of these these are story starter
cubes you get two cubes each there's a
character asserting a situation and and
what you do with these is the kid will
sit and well you could play this the
game with partners or you can play it
with parent and child or however you
want to do it they're color coded so
these are the characters so we have Kang
grandma grandpa giant firefighter Pony
Olympic gymnast fairy godmother she's
got those two dice and then you have
these here it says drinks a magic potion
it's about to go down a waterfall invent
something amazing finds buried treasure
and then those are the events I guess
and then these here are the locations or
the settings on an African
sorry on Mars on a train at the beach so
what you would do is you take three of
these one of each and you roll them and
let's see what my story is going to be
okay so it looks like we have an alien
in a desert that travels through time
and then that's the story that I write
is an alien in the desert that travels
through time this is just a great way
for kids to stretch their brains in
different directions you know to give
them kind of a base sometimes with the
activities like this I'll have the kids
draw a picture first of this happening
and that will help them get their story
going also maybe giving them a word
sentence starter words to help them to
to get them going on remember this is
fourth grade so this is age-appropriate
for fourth grade to be able to do this
if kids that are struggling with
comprehension maybe starting with just
two dice or maybe just one die if
they're really struggling and then you
know or give them a little bit more of a
simple situation like an alien and the
desert traveling through time is going
to be a really fun crazy story so kids
can do it in around where one kid gives
the beginning of the story and then the
next kid gives the next part in the next
kid gives the next part until you've got
a whole story so that would be kind of
fun or it could be a sit down writing
activity
all right the next one is conversation
cubes and they look like they're made by
the same company teacher created
resources and these are kind of like
have you ever or would you do this kinds
of things there's six cubes all together
they're all the same concept so it's not
like here we have three different
concepts you use three cubes of time
this you would just use one like this
one says if you could be any animal
which would you be so this would be a
nice way to go around and get to know
kids at the beginning of the school year
or to just ask your child questions and
get to know them a little bit better
this one says what is something you
would like to become better at so these
would be great for first day of school
even kids getting to know each other you
know set up six groups and have each one
have it die and then give them five
minutes and then have them switch dice
with the group next to them and then get
all new questions and have everybody
kind of go around and
answer them so those are really cool for
the first day of school alright and then
the last thing in here are numbered dice
and these are numbers and operations
dice so what you do with these is you
have the kids roll them and come up with
math problems with them which is great
because you can customize these to any
level you can make this long division
you can make this subtraction addition
whatever you need the only problem with
these you see is they're division on
here there's greater than less than
division addition subtraction
multiplication and then an equal sign
the only problem with these is they're a
little like if you end up with you know
9 minus 12 or something you know the
kids gonna have to know that that's not
gonna work so you're gonna have to have
kids that understand that concept in
order to work with these another thing
you could do if your kids aren't your
students or your child isn't quite there
with rolling them and figuring out
whether in its appropriate problem you
can start off with just having them
create a problem and figuring out the
answers or creating multiple problems
there's plenty of dice here to create
multiple problems you can also do the
greater-than less-than and work out some
algebra that's fourth grade appropriate
to do some algebra
you know division they shouldn't but
they should have gotten an introduction
to multiplication and division in the
third grade so maybe some basic
multiplication and division to start the
year but these are really fun just to
give kids another way to practice one
thing that we're working on in our
classrooms is to give students more
choice so it's great problems maybe some
students would like to write on a dry
erase board maybe some students would
like to create a list of problems using
these you know I mean just to give kids
another option for how to do their math
problems and there's also a little
booklet here not booklet but a little
pamphlet that says different ideas for
how to use the dice so overall my
opinion of this box number one I feel
like it's very age-appropriate for
fourth grade which I really really like
a lot number two I do feel like it's
worth the value of the box of $29 or up
down to the $25 if you go to a school
supply store you're definitely going to
be paying that if not more for all of
these things now the other thing is is
the contents of the box now these these
items are definitely usable none of them
make me go yes I'm really a
sited about this if that makes sense
like none of them are making me go wow
this is something I'm so excited to use
in my classroom I'm definitely happy to
have them I think it's a great box I
think it's age-appropriate I think it's
gonna supplement the classroom but
nothing makes me go wow if that makes
sense
but I mean it's it's one of those things
especially if you're a new teacher or if
you're switching grades and you don't
have a lot of resources for your
classroom this would be a great thing to
have or if you're a mom or a dad and
you're looking for some way to
supplement things at home this will be
great for a seasoned teacher it's kind
of like okay yeah you know like okay I
can use this stuff or it may end up on a
shelf somewhere with all my other things
that I don't ever use so I mostly
recommend this for new teachers teachers
they're switching grades and for parents
I don't think that this box is a WOW
factor for a teacher that's been
teaching more than three or four years
but I guess everybody's different and
everyone has different resources in
their classrooms so overall great box
for the right person and yeah definitely
think it's worth the the subscription
price and that is my review of the
elementary box I hope you enjoyed it if
you did please just give this video a
thumbs up it makes you subscribe if
you're not already subscribed and that's
it mad love and I'll see you in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
