God jelly bean aka the bean boozled
challenge so we have enlisted the entire
family to participate in this challenge
figured it'd be fun to include the kids
okay children have asked you a question
blank okay do you realize that some of
these beans may taste disgusting yeah
John do you realize that some of these
beans may taste disgusting yeah yeah
well letting you know that now if you
eat one of these beans and may taste
yucky is that okay yes okay so you see
they are willing participants in this
experiment so what I've done is I've
prepared four bowls with each of the
flavors in it and we are going to try
them here are the beans and if you
haven't seen this yet you're totally
missing out it's pretty hilarious
basically what you get is you get two
identical-looking beans one of them is a
delicious flavor and one of them is a
supposedly disgusting flavor so for
example one of them is either stinky
socks or tutti frutti there's no way to
know which is which you just have to try
it and see so I've watched a few of
these I watched my friend heather's I
purple kisses I'll put her link to her
channel down below I watched bunny and
LeAnn says do there's graveyard girl
dances and then i watch it's judy time
and her husband do it but i thought you
finally the kids show they're getting
bored so we better get into this
so-called red which one will start with
john which bowl would you like this one
do not eat them yet okay Lila which ones
you like what you're spilling them at
one okay daddy which one would you like
I'll take the big one okay and then I
get the one with the scalloped edges
okay no I think this is my suggestion I
think we should save them the one that
might be mint for last okay okay okay
yes alright so which one should we start
with first job which one should we start
with what color click and color hey okay
let me see okay so that one is the one
that's kind of caramel looking it's
either caramel corn or moldy cheese and
this list alive and I can't find you
this is the one I'm the most afraid of
because I think that this mold is
disgusting okay

want and then we've got prepared a spit
bag sofa where a bag in case it's too
disgusting are we ready yes ready set go
