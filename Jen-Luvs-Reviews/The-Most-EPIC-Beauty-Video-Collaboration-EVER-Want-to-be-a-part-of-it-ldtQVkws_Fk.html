exciting thing to announce to you I am
going to be starting an epic contest for
beauty video creators and this is like a
collaboration like you have never seen
before some of you may know that I used
to have a youtube channel called jen low
37 and on that channel i did a
competition called battle of the youtube
non stars and it was a competition for
people that had less subscribers in
order to get them more views get people
more exposure to their videos really
what it ended up being was a great way
for people to discover new people and it
was super super incredibly fun it was my
favorite thing I ever did on that
channel and it was just absolutely
amazing and I want to recreate that here
on my beauty channel it is called the
best in beauty competition and I am
looking for 12 people I'm not going to
say ladies because it could be meant to
12 people with less than 2,000
subscribers to compete in this
competition for fabulous glorious prizes
there will be a gift card involved to
either Sephora ulta Mac or Amazon it
will be your choice if you win at this
point it will be fifty dollars it could
go up to a hundred dollars depending on
how successful this competition is I may
raise up the prize I also may change it
to having second prize and third prize
as well theres forty-two challenge each
week okay and I will tell you the very
first challenge will be do what you do
best so the very first week you're going
to be six people competing out of the
twelve the lowest the person with the
lowest amount of votes will be
eliminated from the competition the
video creators job will be just to post
a video response showing what they do
best it can be created specifically for
the competition or a video that already
exists showing what they do best people
will go to those videos and then vote
for their favorite the second week will
be the second six people then it will
drop
25 and 5 after that it will be all 8
competing against each other then two
people will be as eliminated so it'll be
down to six down to four down to two and
then downs that will be the finale and
that should take eight weeks total I
promise that the videos you're going to
be asked to create will be something
that you can do and something that will
be appealing to your own subscribers I
won't make you do anything crazy like
eating cinnamon or jumping off a high
ledge or anything weird it's just going
to be beauty typical beauty style videos
if you are interested in competing in
this competition I just need you to put
a comment below telling me you are
interested in being one of the
contestants in this competition the
other thing that I need from you are
people that eat even if you do want to
be part of the competition is I need
intros you can say your username like I
would i might say this is Jen loves
reviews and welcome to the best in
beauty competition or um who's the best
in beauty we'll find out in the best in
beauty competition or you can just say
welcome to the best and beauty
competition that's as fast as it needs
to be maybe you can send them to me on
my facebook you can send me an email my
email is Jen loves reviews at gmail com
there's lots of ways you can get those
videos to me if you're having any
trouble with that just shoot me a
YouTube message and I will help you to
get me your intro I'm going to need
probably at least five per video so
we're talking about 40 intros so I know
you guys can come together and get those
together for me just really really fast
and you will be featured and i will put
your link to your channel down
underneath the video and if you make me

cool and then you can say you can always
say that you were a part of this
competition alright so I hope you're as
excited about this as I am I don't I you
know everything in my bones are is
telling me to do this compet
Shen I'm in the middle of taking a
master's class but I just I just feel it
that this is something that we all need
is a community to kind of bring us all
together and I think it's just going to
be fantastic I'm just pumped about this
and again you just need to have less
than 2000 subscribers you could have no
subscribers or you could have 1999 as
long as you're within that range you are
eligible to compete it's just gonna be
epic and amazing and I'm so stinkin
excited so yeah I hope you can join me
