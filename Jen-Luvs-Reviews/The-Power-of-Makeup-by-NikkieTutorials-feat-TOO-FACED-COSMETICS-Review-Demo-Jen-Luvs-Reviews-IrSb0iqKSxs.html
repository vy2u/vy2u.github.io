in da da da da cut up our makeup hello
my friends welcome to my review and demo
of the power of makeup little set thing
that two-face has designed with youtuber
and nikkietutorials who I absolutely
think is one of the most talented people
on YouTube so gorgeous so incredibly
talented when I saw this was coming out
I was like yes I want to review that it
is mine and I got it
and they comes with a lot of stuff for
the price so I was pretty excited to try
the new sketch marker the colored you
know what before I let me just show you
what's in the kits the way this is gonna
work is I'm gonna show you everything
that's in the kit talk about packaging
things like that we'll do the little
demo I'll show you how it all applies
and then I will give you my full review
so let's get into what comes in this kit
so you open up this cute little leopard
print box and of course the first thing
that you see in the front is the palette
in the palette you get nine eyeshadows
you get two blushes a chocolate Soleil
bronzer and a highlight called champagne
truffle with in the shadows you have
four matte shades you have IV which is
creamy kind of color you've got
painkiller and makeup and chill which
work really well for making transition
colors and also wanted which is a matte
black then you've got some kind of
sparkly glittery kinds of shades in
sugar-coated frosted YUM and
irresistible and then some satiny kinds
of shades in mystic hour and wham bam
the blushes
making sure there's no extra glitter
just fallin in them I believe that I
will always love you is kind of a satiny
blush and then justify my love has
little bits of sparkle in it very very
finely milled sparkle in it so you get
that and also within the box you get
this cute little pouch and I think that
is adorable of them to include this
really nice zippered couch it's not like
a ziplock baggy you know it's a nice
foil pouch and inside you get your
nikkietutorials in a bag okay me three
different looks the look that I'm
wearing today is kind of a combination
of a few of them I kind of did this
first one called Once Upon a glam kind
of mixed with the purple shades in go
big or go go God That's not me and then
the last one I use the glitter from this
one it was mostly a combination of the
first two and then they've got this last
one that I saw Tati from glam life guru
do look gorgeous on her this one is
called glitter is the new black so I
kind of made my own I thought about
doing the first one but I decided to do
my own but we'll get into that in a
minute so you get this little look book
what you think is really nice of them to
include because you want some ideas of
how to use the shadows kind of get some
inspiration and who better to get
inspiration from then Nicky herself the
next thing you get is a travel size or a
deluxe sample size of the Too Faced
better than sex mascara but this is a
purple version which has not been
available before before it only came in
black I believe so it's a purple version
so I would imagine jared is glamming up
like he always does gearing up glamming
himself up for the holiday season
guarantee it not guarantee I have a very
strong feeling we're gonna get colored
to Faced better than sex mascara for the
holidays it hasn't been announced it
hasn't been told to me but I just have
this gut feeling that these are coming
mm-hmm all right next up we have the
sketch marker eyeliner which I was
really excited about
I love pen liners I love to face as a
brand or when my favorite brand so super
excited to try this it's got a cute
little pen clip here I mean just
adorable got a little heart on it and
it's got this little fine point
everything
just so cute so it's really excited to
try that and then also in here you get a
pot of glitter which I've also never
personally seen from Too Faced I don't
know if they've made them in the past or
if they currently make them and I just
don't know about them but this is called
the glamour dust in glitter aliy which
is an adorable name when you open it
there is no sifter it is just loose
glitter dust and it's like an iridescent
glitter it's more s'more on the silver
side than like a true like a plasticy
looking iridescent it's got some silver
in there with the iridescent and then
finally you get a deluxe sample of the
shadow insurance which is their
eyeshadow primer all right now that I've
showed you everything that comes in this
let me go ahead and show you how I got
this look today using these products you
can see them going on
I'm gonna give you my full review after
trying this set for a little over a week
I've used it quite a bit and I
definitely have a solid opinion on
everything let's start with the little
extras that come in and then we'll talk
about the shadows so first of all the
Too Faced shadow insurance I do really
enjoy shadow insurance if you enjoy the
Urban Decay primer potion the original
one you will probably really like this
the ingredients are extremely similar
between the two so if you like that one
you will probably like this one
definitely makes the eyeshadows more
vibrant definitely keeps them on longer
it is kind of a silicone II feel to go
on so if you don't enjoy that you
probably won't like it but I personally
really like the Too Faced shadow
insurance I think it's great one
critique I have already as I wish that
they had included along with the shadow
insurance because I feel like the shadow
insurance is necessary I wish that they
had included glitter glue I feel like
they're gonna include a glitter their
glare glue kind of was a must and I
don't know why they didn't maybe it was
a cost thing but I feel like they should
have sprung for it I think it was kind
of important because there's a lot of
people that like myself that don't own a
glitter glue so I feel like that was
kind of a big miss for this is not
including that but you know what can you
do now you get to see what it's like
when you don't use glitter glue so
speaking of that let's talk about the
loose glitter as you can see in the
little demo this stuff is really messy
if you don't have some kind of adhesive
to put it on your eyes you can use a
tacky ER base you can maybe even use a
little bit of fix plus you know it is a
beautiful glitter I love the way that it
looks
I love the shimmer I love the shine of
it I think it's a beautiful tone and
it's gorgeous it's just you know it
falls everywhere because it's loose
glitter I even tried to kind of tap my
finger off a little bit so that the
fallout wasn't so bad it didn't really
help a whole lot so just be aware you
can always layer it put a tissue down
before you apply which could help a
little bit you could apply your face
makeup afterward which could help a
little bit there's lots of things you
can do to help with the glitter but it's
just kind of a mess the eyeliner is
probably one of my favorite things about
this set I really like the eyeliner a
lot and what I'm learning about pen
eyeliner
is theirs now in my life there used to
be like one Holy Grail like this is my
this is the best eyeliner I've ever used
and now I've got like four that seem to
kind of all tie in their level of
Awesomeness and this is kind of going up
there as far as just being amazing and
doing a really good job one thing I
really love about this is it's very very
very black very opaque and the point is
very very very fine which makes it very
easy to get a wing and it's just a
really nice marker I put it up there if
you like the Kat Von D tattoo liner in
trooper if you like the Stila liner you
will probably really like this it's very
very similar similar in formula and
application and the packaging super cute
now finally the last extra that came in
here was the Too Faced better than sex
purple mascara one thing I have to say
about this because I have used the
original the original is really clumpy
on me it takes some work to get the
clumps out I did not find that with the
colored version I did not find it to be
clumpy I found it to be lengthening I
found it to be volumizing it's a really
nice formula I like it better than the
black one I don't feel like it has quite
as much length and volume as the
original but you also don't have the
clumps and really the difference I feel
to me is quite minimal this really is a
nice mascara and I'm looking forward to
Jared releasing more of them because I
feel like you know I feel like I know
Jared at this point through social media
and his it's happening and everything I
feel like I can predict what he's gonna
do and I think these are gonna come out
that's my thought next up the palette
alright the palette is the star of the
show for this I feel like this is called
the power of makeup for a reason this is
an eyeshadow palette for people that
want transformative looks this is an
eyeshadow palette where you really want
to do something interesting and fun and
unique I would not recommend this to
someone who is just looking for an
everyday going to work look this is a
power of makeup palette to show a
transformation from your regular looking
self to something different so if you go
out at night a lot if you have a very
glam eat job if you just really like a
glam look I think this is a really nice
selection of colors let me show you
something really fun and hold on a
second
okay so when this came out a lot of
people were saying oh my goodness it
looks so much like the Vegas nay I'm not
gonna get it looks too much like the
Vegas name I feel like it has some
similar shades to the Vegas nay but
there's another palette that I feel like
it's even more similar to you guys
remember this one the cherry star beauty
killer palette check this out alright
just ignore the bright pink if you
ignore the bright pink and we put my
hand over it so you can ignore it I was
like I got it and I was like this shades
look kind of familiar I mean they're not
dupes they're not dupes I mean I
actually swatch them all next to each
other every single shade is different
but you've got like a like light pink
this one has a silver this one doesn't
you've got a gold you've got like a
creamy Brown transition color you've got
a deep brownish kind of color this one's
got a little bit more of a rust Cundiff
tone but still like a deep rich brown
you've got kind of a bold bluish teal
color you've got a purple this purple is
warmer than this purple you've got a
black this one's got glitter this one
doesn't I just I was fighting because
they collaborated Nikki and Jeffrey have
collaborated before so I just thought it
was kind of funny that they picked
similar shades but again they're very
very different as far as they're not
dupes but if you own one you may want to
think about not getting the other just
as a suggestion okay talking about
quality of the shadows ease of
application things like that so I feel
like the mattes in here are really
really wonderful really fun to use um
these are really great I feel like Ivy
is just a tad bit powdery but it's not
terrible it's definitely usable I feel
like wham-bam swatches horribly but it
goes on the eye
nealy really easily very very nice I
actually swatched all of these when I
first got it when I was on I was on
periscope which is a live streaming app
if you don't know you have to follow me
on periscope it's super fab so i
swatched all these live on periscope I
did it with a primer without a primer
without a primer was not good swatching
without primer is not good with a primer
they swatch pretty well I feel like they
apply to the all I'd the best so if you
go into the store and you swatch these
just know they do apply better to the
and they definitely apply better with a
primer that's why I said I feel like the
primer that they included is essential
because I feel like it makes a big
difference in the vibrancy of the
shadows for this particular palette so
the the mattes are fantastic I really
like wham-bam mystic hours also really
good irresistible I really like not to
bring back the Geoffrey start but I'm
gonna bring it back I like irresistible
way way better than I like the gold in
here the gold in here is really patchy
hard to work with in the Jeffrey star
but in here the gold is actually really
easy to work with it's very very nice if
you want extra punchy you can always
apply a little bit with your finger and
you'll get extra pizazz from your gold
now these two sugar-coated and frosted
YUM
fall out setting fall out City through
the day not an application an
application I it's tazed on my lid it's
not so bad but by the end of the day
I've got random glitters on my face it
doesn't make me happy I don't enjoy it
so just so you know that's something
that happens with these particular
shades I didn't find that so with
irresistible however irresistible I did
not have nearly as much of glitter on my
face as I did with sugar-coated and
frosted young alright getting down to
the blushes the blushes are really
really nice they're very buildable
lasting powers really good
just typical Too Faced awesome blushes
as you can see when I was putting on
justify my love I was building it up as
I went and it's really nice to be able
to do that because everyone with
different skin types different skin
tones you want to be able to have a
variation and how much you're applying
starting off light building up to more
just perfect perfect perfect formula I
love the blushes now moving on to the
chocolate Soleil in the champagne
truffle let me go get my chocolate
Soleil hold on staff actually have two
different versions of the chocolate
Soleil I have a little mini that I got a
very long time ago which also may affect
the performance that it is a little bit
older I've got a little mini of the
chocolate Soleil I also have it in the
little black book of bronzers which is a
newer one so I'm gonna swatch all three
of these for you just to show you what
what's happening here with the chocolate
Soleil so looking at these this is from
the little black book of bronzers this
is the single and then this is the one
from the nikkietutorials palette when I
first watched these on periscope there
was a significant difference between the
pigmentation of the
one from the Niki palette and the single
and the one from the book of bronzers
now that I've used them a little bit
more it's seen the way there's watching
us watching a lot more similar so just
so you know that may be an issue when
you first get it as far as pigmentation
but as you use it more it does get more
pigmented I do find though that the
chocolate Soleil in this palette is a
little bit more difficult to apply to
the cheeks takes a lot more work to
build it up so if you're looking for a
more subtle bronzer you'll probably
really like this but if you really like
a lot of bronzer it's gonna be difficult
for you to use now let's compare this
champagne truffle with the champagne
truffle that's in the chocolate bar
palette
okay so here's champagne truffle from
the chocolate bar palette and then will
swatch champagne truffle from the Niki
palette so you can see when you look at
the chocolate bar palette champagne
truffle versus the nikkietutorials
champagne truffle the one from the
chocolate bar palette is definitely has
more pigmentation than the one from the
Niki palette I definitely feel like
these are two completely different
formulas the one from the eyeshadow
palette versus the one from this palette
and I think that may have been
intentional I would imagine that they
turned champagne truffle the eyeshadow
into a highlight slightly altering the
formula the tone is the same the it's
the exact same tone it's just a
different level of pigmentation as far
as a highlight on the cheeks I feel like
it is a poppy highlight but it's not a
from space highlighter it's not one of
those ones that's so intense that you're
like whoa girlfriend you sweating your
face off over here or you've got a
highlight on like what is happening it's
not one of those but it is a nice
highlight it's got a nice glow to it it
does have a pink undertone so if you
don't like a pink undertone you probably
won't like it but I personally really
like it I think it's a really nice
formula I like that it's not as
pigmented as the eyeshadow because I
feel like it makes it a little more
subtle which is something that I like on
occasion I like don't from don't get me
wrong I like my from space highlighters
but I also really like subtle ones every
once in a while which kind of surprises
me that they put a little bit more of a
subtle one in the power of makeup
palette I'm kind of glad that they did
because there's plenty of business going
on over here without too much business
going on over here I tried to do this
with the rest of my collection and I
really couldn't find many dupes except
for for the matte shades I definitely
was able to do the the matte Browns the
matte cream the matte black I mean I
don't think that they're very original
but I think that you need those kinds of
shades to make it a complete palette to
be able to make it a complete look so
that you don't have to keep reaching all
around for different things to even out
the look so I'm not I'm not mad at it
for having some pretty typical shades in
there the rest of the shades really
truly are completely unique to my
personal collection so I'm very happy to
have them so overall I feel like this is
a win for me I'm very happy to have it I
am kind of sad that it's very similar to
a palette that I already own but I'm not
hating on it I'm not hating on it it's a
nice palette it's a nice pout lasting
power for the shadows is really really
good I think that they put a lot of love
into this palette and I think that Niki
and Jared both did a fantastic job on
this palette well done the biggest thing
I think you need to consider about
whether this is right for you is whether
you enjoy transformative looks or you're
more of a natural girl or guy so it's
it's up to you I think that's the big
major factor of whether this is going to
be a good purchase for you so I want to
thank you so much for watching this
