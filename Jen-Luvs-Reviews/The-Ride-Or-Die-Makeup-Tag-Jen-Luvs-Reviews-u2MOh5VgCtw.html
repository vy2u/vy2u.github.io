of the Ryder data tag I this has been
the tag that I have been watching
non-stop because everyone seems to have
different ride-or-die products but it's
funny because I feel like a lot of the
things that people are they're like
they're ride-or-die it's either my
ride-or-die too or it's a product that I
just really really like and then some
products that I've never tried before so
I feel like I'm learning a lot this
video is dedicated to Jenna Jenna had
asked me to do this video her mom
recently passed and I was like you know
what I want to bring a smile to Jenna's
face so I'm gonna do this video for
Jenna so Jenna this is for you
girlfriend ride-or-die here we go
so the Ryder diet tag was created by
Jaclyn hill and that's something that
she says all the time is her ride or
diet products so that's what the where
the name comes from we're gonna go ahead
and start with my favourite products but
of course I've got to do it my way which
means that you're gonna get a lot more
products in this video then probably the
typical one because I've counted
different formulas as the qualifiers
because I just can't stop so this
product is the closest thing I have to a
ride-or-die primer I don't really have a
ride-or-die face primer face primer is
something that I just kind of grab
whichever ones on top I don't really
notice a lot of difference between
different face primers on my normal skin
but this is one that I've been
gravitating toward a lot this is the
Josie Maran Argan daily moisture SPF 47
protectant perfect I like it cuz it's
got a little bit of a tint to it
I like Josie Maran products with the
argan oil on my face it feels good I
like the way it feels but this one is
not overly greasy which is something
that I really like a lot and I already
know I've got my ass bf on I know I'm
solid I really like it for that purpose
as well so this is one that I really
really enjoy even though I wouldn't say
it's ride-or-die because it's something
I could definitely live without but it's
the closest thing I got to it next up
eye primer let's talk about eye primer
now eye primer I have a ride-or-die and
this is the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
potion in Eden this has been my
ride-or-die for a very long time I like
the original but I like this one better
because it mutes out discoloration which
is a great way to start off I shadow
looks I personally prefer eyeshadow
primaries that have a little bit of
pigmentation in them show that it can
get me off to a nice clean slate if you
know what I'm saying so recently I've
been getting things from Ulta brand and
I got this one this is the ultra brand
eye primer in nude matte and I looked up
the ingredients and they seemed to be
very similar ingredients so I'm testing
to see if maybe the Ulta is gonna
replace the eden once I run out of it
because if it's cheaper girlfriend I'm
going for the cheaper one if it's the
same thing but I'm gonna be testing this
stay tuned to the channel for this
review
yes Ryder dye is definitely Urban
Decay's primer potion and Eden that's
been upside down the entire time I don't
really have a ride-or-die foundation
either I kind of grabbed a lot of BB
creams and CC creams those are kind of
my thing probably if I had to say one
that I reached for the most that's the
most consistently awesome for me it's a
low mean time free CC cream of all
random things no one ever talks about
this on YouTube I really really love it
I love the light to medium coverage of
it it's mostly a lighter coverage but
that's what I personally prefer on my
day to day so this one is very very nice
it feels good on the skin SPF 20 for
when I'm not wearing my other SPF and
it's just a really nice product it's not
super expensive and it does what I need
it to do lasting power is fantastic and
it's awesome I do have some contenders
for replacing this that I've talked
about recently but there are new
products to me so I'm not calling
anything brand new to me ride-or-die
this is the closest that I've got moving
on to face powder I am shocked that this
is my ride-or-die but it is this is the
Milani face powder I'm not a big face
powder person I don't buy a lot of face
powders man this is like starting off
really boring but I feel like these are
kind of the boring products that we're
starting off with
I like color products and that's where
you're gonna see a lot of passion for me
I don't get a lot of passion off of face
powder but if I could get passion off a
face powder it would be from the Milani
face powder this one is in medium it's
called the multitasker face powder I
actually got this as a gift from my
friend Victoria over Victoria Donnell
though we did a swap together and this
was the powder that she had sent me and
I love it it does what it's supposed to
do lasts a really long time mattifies my
face but not too much just super super
super nice if I had to pick
loose mineral powder however I would
probably choose the bareMinerals
original mineral veil I do really like
the Besame one that's got the vanilla
scent but I like the texture of this one
just a little bit better this is the
holiday packaging so you won't be able
to find this packaging anymore but it's
the same stuff inside all right
Ryder dye eyeshadow palette is really
boring but it's the truth and if I said
anything else I wouldn't be being true
to myself so I'm just gonna go ahead and
people wearing the Too Faced chocolate
bar palette is my ride-or-die palette
this I've said it I've said before I'm
gonna say it again if I could be made
into a pallet it would be the chocolate
bar palette I feel like that this is me
it's me and palette form it's got some
pops of color it's got some calmness
it's got some brightness it's got some
pizzazz it kind of all flows together
but best of all it smells like chocolate
which is like my favorite thing in the
world next to my children and my husband
so I just love this palette it's so
versatile there's so much you can do
with it
very few shades in here that don't work
for me and just my favorite probably my
favorite eyeshadow shade of all time is
creme brulee this one is so insane I'm
gonna hit panel on that one that one's
gonna happen marzipan is also another
one that's a favorite I do a review of a
bunch of Too Faced palettes if you
haven't seen it yet I will link it down
below they also have champagne truffle
in here which is the shade that they
turn into a highlighter for that
nikkietutorials power of makeup palette
oh it's like heaven in a palette it's
just oh it's so perfect it's so perfect
now I got to go into single eyeshadows
and for single eyeshadows my favorite
single eyeshadow of all-time is iced
latte by L'Oreal it's the l'oreal
infallible totally worth the $6
investment in one shadow this is such a
reliable shadow i know that if i need
this kind of shade for an inner corner
highlight or if i'm trying to lighten up
the center of my lid something like that
i know i can reach for iced latte it
will be there for me it's like you know
that person that you don't call on all
the time but when you do it's there for
you i'll be there for you these five
words i swear to you but either way iced
latte that's it that's you okay eyeliner
okay this is what I'm learning about
eyeliner
learning about liquid eyeliner that
there can be a tie there can be a tie
but if I had to pick one liquid eyeliner
she used the rest of my life it would be
the Jessie scroll liquid eyeliner I only
have the brown right now I need to re-up
on my black I have to order it online
because they don't sell it in the right
aides near me so I have to get it online
I like the black better than the brown
and the blue the blue I wasn't a big fan
on it died really quickly the brown was
a little bit better still not as good as
the black but just an amazing liquid
liner especially for seven bucks I mean
it's like super easy to go on wing it
out flip it up I like it better than the
Physicians Formula one that a lot of
people tell me that I should try if I
like this one I feel like that this
one's more opaque than the Physicians
Formula one but it is very similar but I
do like the Jessie's girl better than
that one I feel like it keeps up with my
Kat Von D you want it keeps up with the
seal of one there's also one by Tarte
called the so fine that's really good
the new Too Faced ones the new pen one
these guys the sketch marker ones are
really really good but if I had to pick
one it would be Jesse's girl loyal loyal
I am loyal to my Jessie's Girl liquid
eyeliner nothing else by Jessie's Girl
just the just the eyeliner that's it
alright let's move on to some face
products my favorite blush of all time
is one that has been long discontinued
it is Essex by Kat Von D these blushes
we're super fab and I don't know why she
got rid of them and replaced them with
those craptastic excuse me crappy blush
that she put out I don't know why she
did that because these things were
perfect like in the winter time that
like just in from the cold look they're
just really natural on my skintone but
these aren't available anymore
unfortunately Kat Von D needs to bring
these back we need to start a petition
but if I had to choose one that is still
available I would choose the insane
blushes by the balm this one is in
houndstooth it's very similar to Essex
it's not the same it's not a dupe but
it's similar this one's my second
favorite if I had to pick another one
because the lasting power is a really
good blend ability is really good it
builds really nicely it's just a
fantastic product I love the little
mirror in here to contour okay I could
say the Smashbox contour palette because
it lasts a little bit long
than this one it's an exact dupe but for
the price elf contour palette what is up
with all my drugstore stuff so much
drugstore stuff and I'm being like
totally honest ride-or-die if I could
only buy one for the rest of my life it
would be this one this one is so awesome
this contour shade is just it gives me
life it's wonderful I love setting my
under eye with this this is a really
nice very subtle highlight I like the
bronzer too but I definitely use that
one the least but this shade perfect
contour shade else did a fantastic job
with this palette I just got the
highlighting palette recently also
really amazing but this is definitely
ride-or-die contour palettes
amen for highlight though that highlight
though have to go with mary lou again i
said it before
say it again if I could Mary Mary Lou I
would marry Mary Lou Mary Lou is amazing
Mary Lou is perfect the perfect
highlight in my opinion it is one that
will give you a lot of shine though so
if you are not one that likes a lot of
shine you will not be friends with Mary
Lou but I like it it's not as poppy as
let's say the Becca highlights but it's
not as subtle as the hourglass
highlights it's kind of in the middle as
far as the level of shine that you're
gonna get but Mary Lou has been my
friend for a very long time a very long
time and I loved her before I went in to
face products I meant to do mascara
foccacia mascara ride-or-die mascara is
the Maybelline lash sensational really
love this one the one in the pink tube
the one the black tube is pretty good
but the one the pink tube is definitely
ride-or-die it gives so much length and
so much volume kicks every single
high-end mascara I have ever gotten
including Lancome and Dior and all of
those Marc Jacobs all those super
expensive 20 $25 $30 mascaras this one
kicks their butt
I'm not even exaggerating it is so good
so good I just said this look for the
nikkietutorials palette I was going to
put all of these on but I wanted to get
this video
up in this batch of videos or also I
would put this on for you but look up
tutorials look up pictures of this I'm
telling you it's amazing I also really
like the L'Oreal voluminous butterfly
one but this one beats it out by just a
tad but just a hair last thing I'm gonna
talk about is lips
I don't do setting sprays setting sprays
freak me out I don't like spraying
things on my face I don't like feeling
more product in one place than another
it's just I don't like them so I have no
no rider dye setting spray but for lips
if I had it so choose a lipstick this
one is because of the community this one
is because of periscope because every
time I can't figure out what kind of
lipstick I want to wear hey Jen touch of
spice and I'm like touch of spice I just
wore top to spice yes so they'll like
jad touch of spice I'm like alright fine
put on touch of spice it's always
amazing touch of spice matte lipstick by
Maybelline I'm telling you if I don't
know what to wear touch of spice it
always works it's amazing it's such a
good lipstick I took that lipstick and
it feels good smell isn't bad it's not
strong it's got a smiled sweet smell but
it's not overpowering like the Milani
ones are super overpowering but if I had
to pick one shade touch of spice its
close second very close second because I
can't stop high-end different category
it's a high-end version pink chocolate
by Too Faced which is what I'm wearing
today underneath unicorn tears which is
a fun one but definitely not bride her
die I could definitely live without
unicorn tears it is crazy
I've never seen unicorn tears it's blue
it gives like an iridescent shimmer it's
a nice topper but yeah I mean they're
really very similar in shade I mean
they're very very similar the Too Faced
one is definitely it's not matte wear
touch of spice is matte touch of spice
is a little bit more berry toned
wear pink chocolate is a little bit more
Brown toned but they're both both
amazing I remember when Pantone color of
the year was marsala that's when I
really fell in love with both of these
shades is the perfect marsala shade will
do a rider
rush because I don't know if anybody's
doing ride-or-die brushes but I got one
this one right here this is the Eve
pearl fan brush anytime you see me
applying highlight and probably going to
be using the Eve pearl fan brush this
thing is so awesome it just applies the
perfect amount of highlight I've also
used it for contouring so amazing so
amazing
brighter dye brush brand though has got
to be beauty junkies I did a video for
them not sponsored but they'd sent me
some brushes a long time ago and I've
been hooked ever since exactly the same
as the Sigma ones exactly the same cut
the price at least in half for the
beauty junkies ones and every time I
have a brush in my hand I'm conducting
an orchestra apparently one more lip
product because I have to give you all
of it rider dye liquid lipstick is
Oprah's Pasadena really non shade again
in the exact same family as the other
two I love shades like this it's a
little bit lighter a little more nude a
little more natural for me and my skin
tone it's it's just I love the formula
formulas very whippy it's not over
drying it does have a little bit of a
staining power it's just an amazing
formula these over liquid lipsticks and
I know they're hyped up on YouTube but
they really are amazing and I've been an
over flip liquid lipstick fan for a
really long time and I still really love
that I'm definitely ride-or-die right
here and I don't have a router die lip
loss so don't really wear lip glosses
very much it hasn't really been my thing
for a long time I do have lip glosses
but I was looking through my drawer and
it's like there's nothing I have to show
you that I could even like that even
worn recently in order to know whether
it's something that I really love I mean
I just haven't been wearing them lately
so I'm not going to do it
so that was my ride-or-die tag my way my
version I gotta add my own spin to it
adding extra products deleting other
products thank you so much for being
here if you enjoyed the video definitely
don't forget to hit that thumbs up
button and don't forget to subscribe so
you can see more content on my channel
and it's a lot of fun here I'm putting
off lots of content lately and more
tant coming up very soon thank you again
so much for being here mad love
the first product is not a ride-or-die
but it's the closest thing I have to a
ride-or-die like I have to have this of
the hair okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
