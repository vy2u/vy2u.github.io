I have been oh my goodness this has been
a very interesting test of this product
and I am finally ready to review it for
you hello my friends welcome to my
highly anticipated and highly requested
review of the high mirror I am so
excited to review this for you a high
mirror is a smart skincare Beauty mirror
okay I'm going to show you everything
that it does so no worries it is it's a
crazy new technology that is supposed to
help you evaluate your skincare not just
you know you know like when you buy some
a new skincare regimen and you you're
trying it and you're like is it working
is it really working I'm not really sure
I think it might be working but I'm
normal
that's what this is for this is to help
you figure out whether your skincare is
working or not so you know whether to
continue purchasing it or not that's the
point of it which I thought was really
cool because as a makeup reviewer like
with makeup it's very easy for me to
tell hey it works it doesn't work I just
did a review of the Smashbox mini
palettes I think it's coming out after
this video and but I just did a review
of those and you know I can tell within
a week whether they're good or not with
skincare
sometimes it takes a month or two months
to know whether something is working and
the hi mirror the idea of it was like oh
my gosh this is gonna help me my reviews
so much so when hi Mira contacted me
they asked me to do a sponsored video
for them I was like that's awesome so
now I'm going to cut into the demo of
the product I'm gonna start talking
about some of the pros and cons during
the demo after the demo I'll be giving
you my full review of the hi mirror so
you can have be more educated about
whether you want to purchase this or not
alright welcome to my morning routine so
ever since I got the hi mirror this is
what I do when I wake up in the morning
I push the button on the side and
sometimes I do a little dance and that's
for real
so I didn't want you to have to miss out
on that so there you go so it says hi
mirror and you wait just a minute for it
to
after the high mirror load that tells
you the time and then it actually loads
your weather for the day now for some
reason it always says 75° until it goes
to the next screen at this point this is
when you open up the mirror and it does
do facial recognition here so that only
you can get into your information so now
it has the correct temperature which was
zero degrees Celsius I was playing with
it on my phone on the app and
accidentally switched it to Celsius but
you can have it on Fahrenheit it's very
easy to do that's the way it came loaded
I was just kind of messing around so
here is the news updates if you don't
want to see the news updates you just
kind of have to once you see this screen
go ahead and swipe right away it'll give
you beauty tips and then it'll give you
the most important news stories that are
happening in the world it also gives you
links to skincare advice at different
skincare websites if you want to see
more about the news you can swipe and
you can kind of flip through the
different important news stories for the
day as you can see I'm using hand
gestures to control this this is a no
touch product so you do not need to
touch anything in order to change things
on the mirror you use hand gestures the
sensor is that little circle on the
right at the bottom I believe that's how
you can tell it what you want it to do
so now I'm trying to get out of the news
and go into the skincare analysis for
the day so it's asking me if it wants to
do me to do the skincare analysis and
all I have to do is go up to the mirror
I put my face in the little guide do the
push motion and the light comes on and
it snaps a picture of my face and then
it asks me is that what I want do I like
the picture when I swept to the right
that's yes and then it starts analyzing
the picture for red spots for wrinkles
for fine lines for brightness for
clarity dark spots things like that so
there is my skincare analysis for the
day and it tells me how I'm doing on
each section and then when I swipe when
it listens to me
it tells me about each section and what
it all means
it also tracks the progress through time
so that's my week of progress in that
area and that's my progress in all the
area so it marks all of my red spots
and all of my dark spots
my dark circles my fine lines my pores
and my wrinkles and it gives you a score
for how you're doing it gives you a
percentage oh and then there's
complexion so if I swipe here when I get
on this screen it'll show you my very
first scan and then it'll show you the
scan from today so you can see any
visible differences because my skin is
not doesn't have a lot of things that I
need to correct there isn't really a
whole lot of difference between the
first scan and the scan for today
actually my dark circles look a little
bit works then at the beginning I don't
know why so now I'm going to go ahead
and go back and show you some of the
other features of the high mirror the
one that I'm not going to talk too much
about but I do want to mention is the
body Fitness one this is great for
people that are trying something new and
want to see whether it's working or not
so as you can see nothing has really
changed a whole lot for a very good
reason and that I haven't changed much
to my diet or my exercise plan so it is
in kilograms that's something you have
to reset every single time I'm hoping
they fix that it does say the historical
changes it does tell you a little bit
about the different parts of your body
and the your body type so here are the
changes in my body since I started using
this a week ago and you can see there
hasn't been very much change which makes
sense and if you wait long enough it
will tell you about all the different
things that the scale measures so it
goes into your body fat it goes into
your muscle mass and then it'll go into
your bones and it just weighs everything
and just tells you you know how you're
doing on your diet or your exercise plan
so that's just another feature you can
get if you want to I'm gonna go into
some of the other features so this is my
beauty box and this is where you can
track your skincare and kind of keep
track of when you started using it
I did take these pictures on the high
mirror so those are all the skincare
products that I'm going to show you in a
minute that I use and it's just a way to
kind of keep track of what you have now
I have been having some trouble entering
in specific information about each
product but at least it has allowed me
to take a picture of each item so I know
what I was using on what days so that
way over time you can kind of track your
changes and if you're using this for six
months you can look and see the
difference between what you're using now
and what you are using back then and see
you know maybe you need to go back to
some older products now in order to add
a new product you can either you can
either scan the barcode or you can just
take a picture of it so I tried scanning
my Bioderma and as I'm scanning my
Bioderma it told me that it did not have
Bioderma in the system so I'm assuming
that as they have more people using this
they'll have more products in the system
that you can scan with a barcode so what
I had to do was then take a picture of
it to add it to my beauty box
one thing I really don't like about this
feature is that as you're categorizing
it you have to wait until it gets to the
type of product that it matches and
sometimes it takes a while for it to
scroll there's no way to manually make
it go faster so if you miss the thing
that your thing is like I did it takes a
little while for it to get back to
whatever that skin care type is that
part is a little bit annoying
you
so this is where you can see the record
of your skincare so it tells me I only
put one of these into the app one of
these products so it tells you how your
skin has changed since you've been using
that product so I just did that two days
ago so there isn't much data there but
you can see how it would track it over
time
now this is kind of the fun add-on
things the mirror comes with in the
media center so the first thing I'm
going to show you is the video channel
and what this is is you can hook up your
Google+ account to upload videos about
your progress with the high mirror I was
a little disappointed because this one
had said coming soon and then there was
an update and you know it says that
that's all it is is uploading I was
hoping oh but allow me to watch YouTube
videos but it's just an upload feature
that honestly doesn't really excite me
much you can also watch previous videos
that you've uploaded this is the radio
section so you can listen recently
listened I'm gonna go to the most
popular radio station or you can listen
to radio stations by location you can
see I'm having a little bit of trouble
getting it to go over I'm probably going
too fast yes I was going too fast
sometimes I'm a little impatient you all
know I got a speed issue so speed
meeting I go too fast sometimes so here
are the popular radio stations there's
the metalhead station there's news
stations there's oldies stations and
these are from all over the United
States there is a way to get to
international radio stations but that
seems to be a little bit more difficult
to get to than it used to but I didn't
necessarily enjoy the international
radio stations as much as I I enjoy the
United States radio stations just
because it's more what I'm used to so
you can scroll and see all these
stations all over the United States that
are the most popular among people that
are using the hi mirror so like for
example this one says that its top 40
but it started playing news and that
not make me happy to hear news because I
was looking for top 40 but you never
know what can be playing on a radio
station when it pops up
what what's things about this is now
we're learning about a bar and grill in
Arkansas and of course I live in
Maryland so I'm not going to that bar
and grill in Arkansas so this is a
station that I have no interest in
listening to right now so now I need to
find another one so this is not a fast
process it can be fun to listen to but
you know sometimes it's just more work
than it's worth
now this radio station in Connecticut it
wasn't working at all so I'm going to
get out of that one so this is the radio
by location so you can go to different
states and see the popular radio
stations in that area but the thing
about that is is a lot of people don't
listen to the radio anymore so it's
really just what's popular among people
who are still listening to the radio so
this is the oldies station in Wisconsin
and I'm like sitting there thinking like
this is oldies are you kidding me like
what I was very upset about this to
think about this song as being oldies
went out of focus as I was dancing but
you get the point I just I thought that
was strange in order to stop the music
by the way all you have to do is hit do
the push the push action and it will
pause the music okay so now I just want
to show you that over on the side there
are some features where you can hit the
M and it'll bring you to just a mirror
you can hit the top button they'll take
you to the main screen or you can hit
the buttons that I'm hitting now that
will help you adjust the brightness so
right now I'm bringing the brightness
all the way down and then you can hit
the same button that's like the second
one from the bottom and the one on the
bottom will adjust the volume so that
part is touch but they say you can touch
it with wet fingers so if you're just
out of the shower you can still touch it
as in it'll be fine so that's really
good you know being in the bathroom that
you don't have to worry about touching
with your wet fingers there is something
called high skin and this is brand-new
on the high mirror so I don't think that
this does anything yet but I'm looking
forward to seeing
it does this is what happens when you
turn the mirror off it just has the
little power button it says shutting
down it takes about 20 seconds or so to
shut all the way down and that is the
high mirror and everything that it does
so now I'm just gonna quickly show you
my morning skincare routine because I
thought that that would be fun I was
using all of that polish toy stuff but I
ran out so now I'm back to my nd Lee
toner which is a fantastic toner I was
originally introduced to this and a
beauty lish lucky box those are coming
up by the way the day after Christmas
and I just take my shisei dough facial
cotton and I rub that all over my face
then I get my eye cream out so I put on
my eye cream first um right now I'm
using the it cosmetics bye bye under-eye
that my friend Nancy bought for me so
I've been using that I don't know if it
does anything for me my eyes according
to the high mirror have not done
anything as far as my dark circles but
I'm gonna keep using it and we'll see
what happens I haven't seen any visible
differences either let me know in the
comments below if you use the cosmetics
bye bye under-eye eye cream and if
you've seen any results because I sure
haven't now this company actually set me
a ton of products it's called a SDM
Beverly Hills I believe I got the
letters right and this is 100%
hyaluronic acid serum so I've been using
this for the past week
you're supposed to put a pea-sized
amount on your hand and then rub it all
over your face so I've been doing that
and I really enjoy it I feel like it
hydrates my skin it feels good it's kind
of watery but it feels good on the skin
so I kind of rub it all over and then I
just Pat it into my skin again no
significant differences in using this
but that just might be the fact that I
just don't have a lot of skin problems
and it also may be preventative in
nature and may help the aging process to
slow now I'm going to moisturize using
the dr. jart water drop it's another
thing that my friend Nancy sent me she
sent me this nice little care package of
a bunch of stuff so this was something
that she included and I'm really
enjoying this so I'm just going to ahead
and press that into the skin along with
the serum and kind of get all that into
my pores and and feeling good so I'm
nice and hydrated for the day
and that's it that's all I do for my
morning routine so now you've seen all
the fancy buttons and features and how
it works let me tell you just straight
up how I feel about this
so backstory let's just rewind back to
the end of October when I received this
so hai meraa the people over there were
great at help trying to help me figure
out what was wrong basically what was
happening is I was connecting to the
high mirror app that you you don't have
to purchase it it comes with me with the
high mirror you have to download it's
your smartphone you do have to have a
smartphone in order to use the high
mirror so if you don't have a smartphone
if you're still in flip phone land you
got to borrow someone's phone to get it
started but once you get it started you
really don't need the app anymore you
can just run straight from the mirror so
anyway back in October I was having
trouble connecting my high mirror to my
Wi-Fi it turns out my connection was not
a secure connection which I had no idea
we ended up figuring out after about two
months that I just needed to change the
security settings on my Wi-Fi and then
automatically it connected ever since
then the high mirror has been working
fine so I have been using this for a
week but I have a lot of opinions about
this so far so the first thing I'm gonna
tell you a lot of critiques the first
critique is the camera itself just in
concepts of it that you now have a
camera in your bathroom
now if the high mirror is unplugged it
cannot transmit signals the power is not
connected so if you're freaking out a
feeling weird about a camera being in
your bathroom all you have to do is
unplug the thing and there's no way it
can connect to anything it has to be
plugged in because that's where it gets
the power from there's no battery in
here to connect but you have to remember
if you're not going to unplug it you
have to remember to close this up the
mirror the camera is not supposed to be
doing anything unless it's taking a
picture of your face but I just don't
like a camera in my bathroom and you
know it's gonna freak me out a little
bit
so either unplug your high near or make
sure you have this closed the next thing
is the hand gesture movement sometimes
it takes a few especially the push
motion it takes a couple of times to get
it to do what you want it to do
and to take some practice of seeing
about how far I need to stand away from
the mirror an order to get the hand
gestures to work I do wish that there
was some kind of touch button that I
could do to go up and down through the
menu there their concept was is they
didn't want you to have to put
fingerprints all over your mirror that's
why they're doing the hand gestures and
it is really cool but I mean it's just
kind of sometimes it doesn't exactly
listen to the hand gestures especially
if you go too fast or if you're too far
away those are the two big reasons why
it won't accept a hand gesture but it's
it's pretty cool as far as the actual
skin care evaluation I do find it to be
very interesting I can tell you that the
day after I did the glycolic peel which
is the step that you did not see in the
demo the day after that I the high
mirror did recognize that my skin was
better in quite a few different areas
the day after I used that so I thought
that was very very interesting but I'd
be very curious to see how this would
work with someone like that has acne
scarring or someone that has a you know
someone that has Jonas or dryness or
dark spots or a lot of redness when they
try a new skincare regimen I would love
to see how this would work for somebody
like that because I feel like with me
you know and skincare it's a it's a
blessing and a curse as a reviewer to
have good skin because I can't it's hard
for me to review skincare because I
don't have a lot of problems you know
I'm very thankful don't get me wrong I'm
very thankful but it makes it hard to
review something like this so I just
want to be honest with you and tell you
that I don't know a lot about whether
it's going to track results of skincare
accurately I feel like it probably does
but that's as good as I can go for it
like I said I just love to see it on
someone that has more skin problems than
me to see whether it would work or not
one thing unrelated to the high mirror
and the skincare part is the radio
feature the radio feature I feel like is
I wish the spot if I worked instead
because I feel like the Spotify would be
personal to me and I think that they're
working on it but when that comes
I think I'm gonna really really enjoy
this because I find that the radio
stations like you saw in the demo you
know I'm ending up with other states and
commercials for other states and I'm
spoiled
I'm totally spoiled by Netflix and by
Spotify and without having commercials
and when I'm hearing commercials and of
course commercials that are in a
completely different state with things
they're completely irrelevant to me it's
like mom like I'm not I don't want that
and it's difficult to change to change
stations because you have to go back to
the radio and then you have to swipe to
find the net station that you like and
just kind of annoying you know so I'm
really looking forward to the Spotify
feature
I also wish that I could watch youtube
videos on it there is a video upload
feature but I wish that you could
actually watch YouTube videos now that
would be a cool thing one thing I do
really like about high Mura and what
they're doing with it is that the
updates to it are automatic to the
mirror you never have to plug this in
anywhere it goes through the Wi-Fi and
gets automatic updates I've gotten a
couple of updates on this one of them
was the update of the video feature of
it and I really really liked that I
didn't have to do anything or know that
there was an update it was just
automatically put into the mirror and it
didn't take very long at all it took
less than a minute for the update which
was wonderful
so I am let me just tell you I am very
excited for this mirror to see where it
is going to go the features they're
going to add in the fact that they can
add them remotely without me having to
do anything like that's really exciting
to me because the the potential for this
thing is amazing for what it could
possibly do so I don't know I just I
can't wait to see where they go with
this I am very thankful to have it is it
perfect no it's a brand new product but
I think that they are definitely working
on making it perfect and they're
listening to feedback which i think is
huge because think a lot of brands don't
listen to feedback and I think that's a
big drawback to a lot of brands but high
mirror is listening to feedback which is
yes good job to them so overall this is
a recommend I think that it's a fun
product is it necessary you know is it
fun yes is it going to be more
you bowl to you if you have more truck
problematic skin absolutely if you're
like me without problematic skin you may
want to pass on it because it may not
give you enough value but it is a lot of
fun it's different its unique and I am
really enjoying it and I'm very thankful
to have it so I want to thank you so
much for watching this review of the
high mirror I hope you enjoyed it if you
did definitely make sure you hit the
thumbs up button because it makes me
look super cool hit the subscribe button
if you're not already subscribed and I
will see you in a video very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
