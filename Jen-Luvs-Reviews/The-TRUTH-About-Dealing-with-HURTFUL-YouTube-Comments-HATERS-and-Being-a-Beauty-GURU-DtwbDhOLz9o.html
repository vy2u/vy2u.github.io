comment that just says go kill yourself
or maybe I've gotten a couple but not
many I've blocked it out I love my
friends welcome to this video in the
truth series I haven't done a video on
the truth fit series in a really long
time I will list the playlist down below
and also up in the corner in case you
want to check out the other videos in
the truth series this is where I talk
about YouTube issues and things that are
happening in the YouTube community and
tips and tricks and different things
like that so today we're gonna be
talking about dealing with negativity on
YouTube and I think that it's not just
the creators that deal with negativity
on YouTube it's people in the comment
section deal with negativity and I think
that there's a lot of things that we can
do to minimize negativity because I feel
like sometimes we contribute to the
negativity without meaning to so let's
talk about a little bit about comments
on YouTube because as you know they can
get quite negative but negative doesn't
necessarily mean that it's a hater
comment and I think that's where a lot
of things get confused is that people
automatically assume that negative means
hate and negative isn't always hate
negative might just be somebody trying
to help we're gonna talk about you know
the the most intense horribleness moving
up to the ones that might actually not
be so bad first the ones that are just
mean thankfully I've never gotten a
comment that just says go kill yourself
or maybe I've gotten a couple but not
many I've blocked it out but you know
ones that are just not helpful you are
such a insert expletive here those are
just somebody that's bored in my opinion
it's probably just somebody see I'm
being judging that's one thing I try
really hard not to do this is this is a
thing whenever I get any kind of comment
that I am taking personally and upset I
try to just take a step back and I try
not to be judging myself so when someone
says I hate you go kill yourself I take
a step back and I say whoa okay is this
person really mad at me or is there
something else happening because I just
made a makeup video I didn't do anything
to them personally so something is going
on behind the scenes that I
I'm not aware of I almost want to go
over and give them a hug and say it's
gonna be alright you know it's okay and
sometimes I do say things like that
I mean I'm one that I do feed the trolls
I honestly feel like sometimes it's
beneficial to feed the trolls in YouTube
comments because sometimes I have
actually gained subscribers from my
trolls because I'm actually quite nice
to people and they realize oh well maybe
I shouldn't have acted like that it
doesn't happen all the time but when it
does it's like score so really mean ones
where people are just outright mean and
hateful with no basis in anything real
block delete move on
you just can't it's obviously something
that's not you it's something that's
them I mean it's it's not you it's not
you that's what it comes down to and in
the comments section too if you comment
something and then probably somebody
says kill yourself it's not you they
don't know you they don't they don't
know it's not you it's not you the
second level is when someone says
something like I can't believe you did
this I am so disappointed in you
unsubscribe comments like that were
typed purposely to hurt when someone
says unsubscribe they're trying to dig
at you or me they're trying to dig
they're trying to get you and the thing
is is if they're not enjoying your
content then maybe they shouldn't be
around anymore I'm not one that I try to
hold on to subscribers the people that
want to watch my videos I want to stay
if people don't want to watch my videos
they should not be subscribed go spend
your time doing something you enjoy more
it's like a breakup you know I don't
want to be with a guy that has that no
interest in being with me if you have no
interest in this channel I don't I don't
think you should be here I think you
should go off and find a channel you
like better I recently got a comment
from someone that was upset about my
Jeffrey star video and said you know
that I was unprofessional for even
discussing him as a person and you know
if you don't like someone that discusses
people and how they feel about them as a
person you probably don't belong here
because you're gonna find that again I'm
gonna say it again and it's not gonna
stop so if you don't like that then feel
free to move on and their response was
basically you shouldn't be telling me to
go because you
because you know Jeffrey Starr has
millions of subscribers and look at you
you little person so you really
shouldn't be telling me to go go
subscribe somewhere else and that and
the thing is is I don't care and I hate
to say I don't care but I don't I don't
I don't care if that person doesn't
watch because they don't like Who I am
I'm not gonna do everything in my power
to please them so that they stay that's
not what I'm here for I'm here to review
products and I'm here to be myself and
I'm here to give you a rockin channel to
watch that you enjoy watching and if
they're not digging on it I'm sorry but
you've got to move on you got to move on
and if you have a youtube channel and
you have people that yell at you
unsubscribe let them go just let them go
because people will appreciate you for
who you are alright
next type of person okay is a type of
person that gives you constructive
feedback on your video and it may not be
in a very nice way you mess this up you
didn't do this right you said this wrong
and you are wrong and I'm right and not
said in a kind way those are interesting
those are difficult they're very very
tricky because my first instinct always
is to lash out wow you don't I can't
believe them and then I sit back and I
go oh they kind of got a point there and
I have to sit back and I have to think
am i mad them or am i mad at myself for
making a mistake Who am I really mad at
I mean yes maybe they could have said
things a little bit nicer but I can't be
mad at them for pointing out something
that I did wrong that I made a mistake
on I mean I'm human and I don't do
things right all the time
I make mistakes and then the best thing
that we can do as creators is to correct
them if you're in the comments and
someone says you're wrong about this
lashing out at them and saying well bah
bah bah bah bah bah blah and cussing at
them is maybe not won't be the most
productive thing to do but maybe just
sitting back and be like hey you know
what I didn't know about that and I
learn from you so thank you for that and
they leave a little bit happier maybe
they weren't in the best mood when they
type something negative in a negative
way but now that you're validating that
they were correct maybe it'll cheer them
up a little bit
Noba have a better day and maybe those
spent spread that smile to someone near
them you know what I mean it's all
kumbaya and making the world a better
place you know and and anytime we can
spread positivity even with someone that
we may not feel positive vibes toward
it's a good thing you know and and
especially when someone is right and and
that happens to me where I'm wrong and
then someone says something and they're
right and I take a personal I feel I get
sick to my stomach I can't believe that
why are they saying this why did they
say it in such a mean way like I
understand that they're right but why
they say it's so mean and then I read it
again that's like well wasn't really
mean it was just factual and they're
just you know it's me taking it
personally so when you get comments like
that or if you're in the comments
section and and those kinds of things
happen to you take a step back and
realize and think about who are you
really mad at are you mad at them for
making the comment or you mad at
yourself for making a mistake so you
know take that into you know a little
food for thought there for you and of
course I can't do a video about negative
comments without talking about all the
positive comments that I get and how
thankful I am for them I just had kind
of a sad day yesterday where my feelings
were kind of hurt for a couple of things
I mean it wasn't anything at a grand
scheme of things of anything big you
know but in my little world it was it
was kind of a tough day yesterday and
you know I was reading some of the
comments and it's just I take all those
positive comments to heart and I try to
blow them up bigger because it's easy to
let the negative comments drag you down
it's easy to let that one person pull
you to a point where you're feeling bad
about yourself but if you focus on
positive things in your life and and
really understand you know and think
about that how much positive to do I
have in comparison with how much
negative and my comment sections are 95%
positive and 5% negative why am I going
to let that 5% bring me down and make me
feel bad you know and and yesterday I
really tried to resonate on the positive
comments and the positive people that
are in the what's of a makeup community
people on the Facebook group people that
comment on the videos people in
periscope people that I have grown to be
quite attached to
you know I'm just really thankful for
all the people that I've met through
YouTube and whether I've met you in
person or not I'm thankful for you
whether we've talked to social media or
not I'm thankful for you and I
appreciate you being here and clicking
along the videos and and and watching
and supporting my channel it really
means a lot to me so I definitely wanted
to make sure I mention that because
focusing on the positive I think is a
really important part of this whole
thing and sometimes it can be hard but
you have to force yourself to put some
of the true negativity aside any
negative that's constructive put it to
positive use and really try to spin it
in a good way for yourself so that you
can take something and add it to your
life rather than letting people take
things from you so that's my thoughts on
negative comments on YouTube I want to
thank you so much for watching this
video I hope that it helped you to feel
a little happier and I hope the next
time you get in a situation where
something negative affects you I hope
that you kind of think about some of the
things ways to spin it to kind of make
your life a little bit happier in the
moment so thanks again so much for
watching my love and I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
