video in the truth series this video was
inspired by a woman who has a channel
called I'm just here for the tea and
since her video came out I've gotten
some questions about my use of magic
links so I figured in for the sake of
transparency I would show you exactly
what magic links are tell you exactly
how much money I've made and how people
have contributed to me making that money
so the video that she made focuses on
nikkietutorials in a program that she
uses that's very similar to magic links
it's a different program but I can show
you how magic links has worked for me
and how people who have watched my
videos have helped me to make money
using it so let me just define what
magic links is it is just a way for
youtubers to make money through customer
referrals so let me just show you okay
so I can create a link for example I'm
planning on reviewing the pastel goth
palette by Kat Von D so what I would do
is I would go to Kat Von D on Sephora
and I would copy a link I go back to
magic links and I would paste it here
then I would generate a link this link
here that says go magic dot Lee this is
my magic link so that will link and let
Sephora know that I referred customers
to their website and they would pay me a
small percentage of the sale this does
not cost the person who is clicking on
the link any money all it does is it
shows Sephora
that I have referred that customer and
rewards me for it so this is what you'll
see in the description of my videos
along with the disclaimer that says
magic links support this channel at no
cost to you so let me show you a little
more details this is kind of where it
gets interesting let's get into my
performance reports so as you can see I
started on magic links in October and
I've made $45 and 20 cents since then so
that's not a lot of money bigger
channels are probably making more than I
am but at 67,000 subscribers I'm a small
Channel compared to the large channels
so let's click here so this one will
show me my daily clicks of how many
clicks I've gotten so the my top 10
clicks links clicked today me number one
is t.j.maxx ebay max just came out with
they started to sell Kevyn Aucoin
products and dolce gabbana products so i
linked that in one of my makeup minutes
so that is where this link came from i
had 16 clicks today and a hundred and
two click with six little bit and a
hundred and two clicks since in the last
70s but that doesn't that's not as
interesting as the next page which is
the merchants page so this is where you
can see where my money is coming from so
you can see sephora I've gotten 569
clicks I've made almost $30.00 from my
sephora links altogether Beauty lish $7
t.j.maxx almost $4 but you can see that
a lot of them I have made zero dollars
and the reason why I've made zero
dollars is probably because the people
who are clicking on these links are not
purchasing anything if they don't
purchase anything I don't make any money
this is where it really gets interesting
to me at least two transactions here for
the NARS narcissus unfiltered cheek
palette 187 dollars in sales they
obviously bought more than just the NARS
cheek palette I made $13 off of those
two purchases so you can see
percentage-wise it's 7% which is a nice
percentage but it's not a huge
percentage I did link directly to the
narcissus cheek palette and that's the
money that I made this one is to
sephora.com to people purchased one
hundred and sixty-five dollars using
that link so I made eleven dollars and
59 cents and I'm not going to go through
each one but these are the percentages
that I have made now this here is the
pay-per-click products I've only had one
of those that I have done 15 clicks on
the lorac mega Pro palette 3 21 cents
because they're only a little over one
cent per click from the ulta.com
website so that one I didn't make a lot
of money and that's okay but so my point
of showing you that is just that you
know you don't always make a lot of
money but it is a way to make money it
does add up over time the next page is
the links page so you can see it's just
another way to look at you know making
money and how the links have been used
and a map that shows me that all of the
people clicking have been in the United
States and the payment page the payment
page explains that
I have to earn over $50 in order to get
any money I'm about to hit that
threshold I'll finally get my first
check which will be quite nice I can
also get money from referring customers
I'm not going to click there because
private information about those people
that I've referred but just know that
it's only a few cents per person it is
not a lot of money I've made less than
$1 off of the two people that have
signed up using my referral link and
that is basically how magic links works
you click on it and I make a percentage
the biggest percentage I've ever seen
has been a little over ten percent of
the sale and the least I've seen is less
than one cents so there's no real way to
know how much you're contributing to the
channel by clicking on the link except
for I I'll find out once I get my report
I don't even know most of the time when
I create the links what the percentage
is one thing that I'm just here for the
team mention is that there may be some
kind of strategy in that some websites
are available on magic links and some
are not so for example if I go over here
and I try to create a link for Kiko
Milano Cosmetics you can see it says
this sorry this retail is not currently
supported but now now we know you're
interested so she feels like that some
people may not use Kiko Milano calm
because they're not going to make any
money off of it for me the money that I
make off of certain websites is pretty
insignificant I honestly don't go
shopping on magic links to make sure I'm
using a retailer that is linked I just
do the one that I either is the first
one that I think of or the one that I
think is most convenient for my viewers
I don't cherry-pick which links I use
based on magic links because honestly
it's not worth my investment of time to
try to find the best links I'm not
making enough money off of it for it to
matter but people that have larger
channels it may make a huge difference
so they may be more strategic in their
use of these kinds of reward programs
but currently I am NOT being strategic
in that way I try to err on the most
convenient place for you to order
something I tried really would rather
link ulta.com or sephora.com because I
feel like
places that have rewards program that
people are involved in and they're my
preferred places to shop so I will I
will probably link Sephora rather than
let's say tart calm or you know a place
like that I probably won't link you know
to face like a more tart calm as often
as I would link Sephora calm unless it's
not unless it's just not available at
Sephora calm just because I know that
people are involved in those reward
programs but there's no strategy there
when it comes to me using these but if
you guys have any questions about
anything when it comes to magic links or
how I make money based on what you are
doing please let me know I will tell you
it's no problem I am an extremely
transparent person I have no problem
explaining anything you want me to
explain to you about why and how I do
the things that I do if you don't want
to click on my magic links that is 100%
okay but that's why I'm making this
video I'm making this video so that you
can be educated on whether you want to
participate or not so I want to thank
you so much for watching this video I
hope it was helpful and if it was that's
awesome if it wasn't I'm sorry for
wasting part of your day and I hope you
guys have a wonderful weekend coming up

periscope so that you can come with me
