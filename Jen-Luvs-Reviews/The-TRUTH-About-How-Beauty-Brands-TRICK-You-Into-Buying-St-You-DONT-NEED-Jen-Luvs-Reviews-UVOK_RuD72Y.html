video in the truth series the last one
was so interesting the response to it a
lot of a lot of interesting opinions on
that last one but also a lot of requests
to do another video in the truth series
so today we're going to be talking about
how brands trick us into buying things
that we don't need and what the holiday
is coming up you need to watch this
video I'm telling you you need to see it
you may have noticed that even though it
is the middle of August we are already
getting sneak peeks of holiday
collections from different makeup brands
it is the season of giving and of joy
and of consumerism and we need to be
strong and make sure we are not spending
on things that we don't need how many
times have you gone in your makeup
collection and looked at something you
bought during the holidays and thought
why did I buy this why why why do I even
own this I don't even like this I never
liked it in the first place
but because of reason X I was tricked
into buying it so we're going to
identify the most popular ways that
brands trick us into buying things that
we don't need and I'm giving you the
tools and the arms to stand up and fight
against consumerism and save your money
for things that you actually really want
a need in your life as in the last video
I polled my facebook group which is a
facebook.com slash group slash what's up
and makeup and I said this it's time for
another truth video and I love your help
and insight it is going to be all about
common tricks brand use to get you to
buy products that you don't need which
trick gets you the most often I told
them they could choose as many options
as they felt applied to them they could
also add options if they felt that I had
missed something from the poll I told
them to make sure to focus on marketing
tactics not like you know seeing an
honest review or really enjoying the
color scheme or things like that I'm
talking about the
action the flip the spin of the makeup
industry and other industries that did
trick us into getting things that we
don't need so anyway so some of the
things that did not make the top five
are online only releases sponsored
videos or posts that appear on social
media timeline collaboration it smells
wonderful that's something that gets me
all the time when two-face said they
were coming out with a strawberry
collection they might as well just taken
my credit card they might as well
because it's like it smells like
strawberries I wanted it all immediately
because it's not good that's one that
always gets me a buy one get one free
deal adding X step in your routine will
give you X results so a brand new kind
of product that you don't already own
that seems to be revolutionary like when
the beauty blender came out things like
that limited edition packaging a value
set like Visa for a favorites kit so
they gave all these great ideas
youtubers review in advance and rave
about it and push their affiliate codes
y'all know all about that one sneak
peeks for months building hype that was
one that guess that I felt like was huge
but it didn't make the top 5 which I was
really surprised about because you see
that all the time is that people build
that hype you know Too Faced is the
master of that you know giving a sneak
peak a year or two years ahead of
something that's going to come out get
your mouth watering for it and then give
you a little taste a little taste a
little taste for like six months to a
year you know the old two point
multiplier or point bonuses things like
that gifts with purchase and now we're
going to get into the top five so the
number five spot was beautiful packaging
and if you are a sucker for beautiful
packaging you have to let me know what
brand you feel is the one that has the
packaging that sucks you in the most for
some people it's the luxury brands like
Charlotte Tilbury or who else has some
really good ones
I feel like Marc Jacobs eyeshadow
palettes have that really sleek look
things like that a lot of I feel like
the beauty lish brands really have that
beautiful packaging when they press it
really pretty
Michelle Takei is really really popular
for that
having the beautiful pressed images into
their products of course those are all
super high-end brands I don't own any of
it but it makes me go who I want to buy
that because it is so pretty
number four I was surprised made it to
number four and it's the offering of
free shipping I do feel though like I
don't know about you but I feel like I
don't want to ever pay for shipping ever
again like I don't know what it is like
things cause money to ship why do I not
want to pay for shipping I have one that
will bump up my cart until I get free
shipping with stuff that I don't need
just to get free shipping where the
shipping was like eight dollars so I add
ten dollars of stuff to my cart so that
I can get that $2.00 that one item for
two dollars you know what I mean like
it's like I always fall for that every
time and I don't know why I don't know
why they get me every single time oh
this is a big one sold out but back for
a limited time can you imagine the
madness that would happen if Anastasio
brought back the master palette by Mario
for a limited time only the internet
would explode it would explode because
there are so many people that say they
wish that they had gotten that palette
or other honest audio pellets from you
know before the modern renaissance
palette but then brands get in trouble
for when they say it's me back for a
limited time and then it comes back to
be permanent like what happened with the
color rain Queen of Hearts palette where
it went out for sale it's sold out I
think they brought it back and it sold
out again and then like a year later
they brought it back for a limited
release and it sold out again so then
they just decided to make it permanent
and people went livid like there well
this was supposed to be a limited
edition and I work I tried so hard to
get it and I got it and now you're
bringing it back to be permanent why did
I even bother to rush to buy it it was
just going to be permanent involve ah
I personally like I would rather things
not be a limited edition that's just my
opinion you can disagree with me if you
want but that's my opinion
I would rather things that are popular
just be around for a while if not
forever and I don't hate on brands that
bring things back and end up you know
making them permanent I can see the
deception level in
I don't know I'd love to know what you
think do you does that bother you when
when when brands do that for me I would
just rather see a popular thing come
back to that everybody can enjoy it but
that's just me personally
number two is kind of the sister to
number three it's the limited edition
and it's never coming back that I feel
like is one of those like collector
things there's that feeling inside of if
I don't get it and it's awesome I'm
going to regret it
so you feel that pressure to get it and
then it's like wait
there weren't any reviews out for it so
you didn't know that it was whether it
was going to be good or not you just
kind of went on your hunch or your
impulse because you don't want to miss
out and feel that feeling of regret and
that's the psychology they're playing
your brain on that they are they're
playing on your human weaknesses it
doesn't matter whether it's
limited-edition or not as you know you
will never use it look at the thing look
at what it is and say will I truly
actually use this take the whole
limited-edition thing out of it if
you've got that feeling in your head yes
this is something I will use yes of
course you know go for it and get it but
you know you've got to take that moment
to stop and think you've got to pull
back that impulse buy for just a minute
if you want to save some money on things
that you don't need and finally being
number one reason according to my
Facebook group which you know it could
if I pulled a different group of people
this may not have been number one but my
facebook group said that the number one
thing makes them buy something is a
limited-time percent off sale which I
thought was very very interesting that's
how the Alta sales and Sephora sales
really get all of us when we can get 20%
off of anything we want at before it's
like oh you know like oh my gosh we just
have to go crazy and get everything that
we ever wanted and more and I've done it
I've done it so many times but at the
same time I need to make sure and you
can decide whether this is you or not
to make sure I'm not grabbing things
especially if I go to the store that's
why I try to shop online so like when I
go in the store it's even worse because
I'm I just start grabbing things and
putting it in my basket that I
definitely don't need but just taking a
moment and really thinking about it you
know one thing I do to get myself not
to shop like that is I will go during
the Sephora sale I will go online I will
fill up my cart with everything that I
want and then the next day or even that
evening you know I'll show up in the
morning even that evening I'll go back
through my cart and I'll leave some
things out and I'll keep doing that
until I feel like I've got the bare
bones of what I truly truly truly want
but I think that impulse buy is what
really gets us during the holiday season
during all of these sales during this
this time of consumerism and if you've
got a ton of money to blow and it
doesn't matter to you how you you spend
it and you just want to go crazy there's
no judgment from me to you you go crazy
but if you are someone that is a little
more frugal that wants to spend their
money on on things that they really
truly want to need that's who I'm
talking to right now so just take a
minute and think about these top five
things and if you need to come back and
watch this video again or put a little
note in your phone of something of these
five tricks and remind yourself that you
are smarter than this you are better
than this and you will not be tricked
into buying something that you will
regret later because you are better than
that and you can do it and I believe in
you I believe in me too I'm going to
send all this back to me because I need
this as much as I feel like I need to
send it out to you if we definitely
don't need everything that you leave in
the comments down below which one of
these tricks are you most likely to fall
for do you feel like my facebook groups
was spot-on with the top 5 that they
chose would you have put something a
little higher than what they did is
there something that they missed I would
love to know your thoughts in the
comments below and the things you
struggle with and let's all support each
other through all of this we can do it
we've got this together I want to thank
