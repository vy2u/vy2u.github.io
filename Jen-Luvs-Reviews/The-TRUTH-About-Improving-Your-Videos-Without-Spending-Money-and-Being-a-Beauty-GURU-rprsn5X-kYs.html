hello my friends welcome to another
video in the truth series if you haven't
seen any of my videos on the truth
series usually these are about YouTube
related topics and things that people
don't really talk about on YouTube for
one reason or another this one I don't
know why people don't talk about it more
I guess maybe because people aren't
really sure what to say it videos like
this but I've got some great tips for
you if you have a youtube channel on how
you can improve your YouTube channel
without spending any money at all the
first thing that I want to talked about
is camera angle now camera angle if
you've done the film and things which I
haven't done a whole lot of but I had a
friend thankfully enough who was into
film who helps me early on to talk about
the rule of thirds and the way that the
rule of thirds works is that you imagine
the screen being slotted into nine boxes
okay so you've got your bottom third
you've got your middle third and then
you've got your top third okay so your
top third is like from here up your eyes
should be at the top third your eye
should be right about here now I tend to
err on the side of chopping the top of
my head off versus being down here let
me show you the difference if I pull my
camera up like this hello my friends
welcome to YouTube I I want me to be the
focus not my background and that's a
mistake a lot of people make is they
have these really cool backgrounds maybe
they've got giant nail polish displays
or lots of makeup or lots of jewelry and
things and they want to show off
everything the background but you have
to remember to get the camera back right
you have to remember that you are the
focus not your background so keep your
face being what is most important the
other thing I want to talk about also is
your background
now background is something I've
struggled with since the beginning of
this YouTube channel I've had trouble in
trouble and trouble I was filming
outside for a little while I feel like
I'm still not in the right spot
let's forget from messing with it okay
but I was even filming outside for a
while because I couldn't get natural
lighting in my home
I didn't have a lot of windows in the
house that I was living in right before
I moved not too long ago moved in the
summer and there was just no natural
light so I did the best I could with my
background but without spending any
money it's really difficult to get a
nice background sometime so do what you
can clean up your background I've been
watching a lot of videos lately and
flipping through a lot of newer
youtubers who just have mess in the
background just mess everywhere there's
clothes on the floor the closet doors
are open there's you know just junk
everywhere you know a towel hanging from
the door it's like some people not
necessarily me but some people are very
turned off by when they see clutter in
the background so try to keep your
background neat and clean even if it's
more simplistic I think it's better to
err on the side of simplicity for your
background rather than having it be
messy in the background because again
like I was saying you need to be the
focus of your video not your back
another thing that I want to talk to you
out is looking at the camera when you're
first starting off it's really easy to
keep looking at the monitor my monitors
up here when I first started my monitor
was over here and it was really hard for
me not with the monitor because I want
to be in frame so I want to look at my
monitor to make sure that I'm in frame
but the problem is is then you lose that
connection with your audience because
right now it feels like I'm talking to
you I'm talking to a camera lens but it
looks like I'm speaking to you because
I'm looking at you because you are
what's important right now is that that
we're having a connection right now do
you feel it do you feel this warm
connection we're having I know I do so
that's really really important to
connect with your audience they can feel
like they can relate to you if you're
constantly looking like this constantly
looking like this or like this it's a
lot harder to relate even some really
big youtubers I catch a lot looking away
from the camera lens all the time and
that's just something that gets better
with practice
another thing is your tone of voice okay
a lot of people when they get on YouTube
for the first time they're nervous
maybe not sure themselves not feeling
very confident my dogs in the background
excuses little jiggly jangling you know
your when you first start in YouTube
it's hard to have a lot of confidence
because it's an uncomfortable situation
sitting here talking to a
inanimate object which is what we're
essentially doing and it's easy to get
nervous and tense up and kind of this is
my Ipsy bag that I got in the mail it's
very nice it has lots of stars on it and
it's very nice bag and then in my Ipsy
bag this month if you're not excited
about the product the people who are
watching are gonna be excited about
either you have to be either you show a
motion toward what you're doing whatever
you want your audience to feel that's
what you want them to feel in your voice
you have to feel the way your audience
you want your audience to feel about it
if you're bored your audience is gonna
be bored same thing about watching your
tone
and making sure you're not predictable
in your tone you know if you watch my
wife's of a makeup news show my tone is
extremely predictable because I'm doing
like a newscaster voice that's not my
natural voice but a lot of times you'll
see people when they review and they'll
do the same and this product here is a
wonderful product and no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no and their voice just goes so I
challenge you to look back at your
videos and see if your voice is very
predictable and see if you're doing the
exact same thing every time you show a
product or every time you do a different
part of your eye look or whatever it is
try not to be predictable on the way
you're selling things the way you're
talking to the camera should be the way
that you talk to your friends along with
that it really really helps to prepare
ahead of time to know what you're going
to be talking about ahead of time and
I've seen some bigger name youtubers
make mistakes on this as well where they
maybe get a product of a review and then
they open the box and they're like oh I
got this for review what's it called I
don't even know what it's called it's
called this because they don't even open
the box before they started filming so
make sure you know what you're talking
about okay if I'm gonna talk about this
palette I need to know how much it costs
I need to know what
how many eyeshadows are in it I need to
know already what I think about this
palette have solid information in my
head about what I think before I begin
filming I need to know where this video
is going you don't want to over prepare
you don't want to script everything out
because then you're gonna sound
ridiculous but have a general idea of
what you're gonna say before you say it
along those
lines after you edit your video or after
you film your video watch it through and
think is this a video that I would watch
is this a channel I would subscribe to
and the answer is No then you should go
to the videos that you watch right early
take some notes on some things you
really really like about all the
channels you subscribe I'm not in any
way suggesting that you copy anybody
that's not a good idea but take some
notes do you like the way that somebody
you know the way they do their
application the way they do their
close-up shots maybe you like the way
someone reviews maybe you like they
include prices maybe you like that they
do close-ups of the products maybe you
like that they try them on on camera
include those elements in your videos
the things that you like in videos
include those in your videos and make
sure your channel is a channel you would
personally subscribe to and if you would
personally subscribe to you
others will subscribe to you because you
have good taste in makeup videos I
guarantee it because you're watching
this video which shows me you have good
taste in makeup videos I'm totally
kidding your thumbnail is critical
absolutely critical and whether
somebody's gonna click on that video or
not one way to get excellent thumbnails
and I'm not sponsored hashtag not
sponsored picmonkey.com
is wonderful it is like Photoshop but
for people that don't know how to
Photoshop like me there is a paid
version that you can buy but that's not
100% necessary I definitely recommend
you try it out without paying first and
decide if it's something you like like
for example in all of my thumbnails I
photoshop out my wrinkles the tool is
called wrinkle remover and you literally
take you click wrinkle remover and you
brush it over your wrinkles and your
wrinkles are magically gone ahh
mind blown pull the other thing you can
do it can help you with your lighting
you can do auto adjusting for your
lighting you can lighten your your image
you can darken it a bit if you tend to
be blown out you can you can insert text
but the basics are 100% free and that's
really plenty that's really all you need
are the basics another one that you
might not have thought of is your upload
time the time that you upload your video
is actual
very very important to who watches your
videos because when you upload your
video that is when your video is set to
your subscribers and if you want the
biggest bang for your buck you want to
send that video out when most of your
subscribers are online and watching and
the trick to how you figured this out
is you look at your videos you put up
recently and see if there's any spikes
in times when people are watching your
videos so for me it's 10 a.m. 10 a.m.
for whatever reason is my magic time for
uploading I'll see a spike at 10 a.m.
when I upload the next day I'll see
another spike at 10 a.m. and then the
third day I'll see another small spike
at 10 a.m. if you're uploading your
videos at 10 o'clock at night 11 o'clock
at night midnight you're missing out on
a lot of your subscribers because by the
time they get to their watch time you
have 15 videos ahead of you that they
might choose to watch before they even
see you uploaded a video so definitely
check out your YouTube analytics and
look and see your live watch time or
your watch time on your most recent
videos and look and see if you have any
spikes of when people are watching your
but another thing that can make a huge
difference in getting views on a video
is to make your videos about searchable
topics things that people are searching
for and interested in and I can tell you
that the the videos that I have made
they're searchable there are ones that
people are looking for live on forever
because just because you uploaded it two
years ago doesn't mean you can't still
get views on it doesn't mean you can't
make money off of it my most popular not
most popular my biggest money-making
video that I have ever made in the
history of my channel was one for rose
wholesale that is a Chinese clothing
company that advertises on Facebook they
offered to send me some products for
review and I did an honest review of
them I hated everything and I have made
over $800 on that video I made that
video two years ago and it is still
consistently every month my most watched
video blown your mind right because
people are searching for reviews on rose
wholesale
because they see an advertisement on
Facebook they want to know about it and
no one wants to give them the time of
day because chances are the products are
not going to be very good because the
the reputation of Chinese clothing
companies is not very good but people
are still curious about it and no one
makes videos on it and I happen to when
I was starting out my channel was just
starting to get things free for
promotion for different companies happen
to accept the offer from Roseville so
they were the first Chinese company to
offer me products for review and I took
it and I'm so thankful because $800
later I'm like thank you Rose Hill
wholesale for sending me these junk
products because I have it's still my
most popular video another really
popular video that I did a very long
time ago was my the balm brand review
because the balm is not one that people
tend to own a ton of products from I
happen to love the balm I'm a collector
of the balm products so when I did that
video I had a ton of products to talk
about and it's very very searchable so
that video continues to live on and I
have made hundreds and hundreds of
dollars off of that video because people
are searching for it and watching it for
many years over time it continues to
earn money and it's typically in my top
5 most armed videos in a month pretty
crazy right so definitely find those
topics that you think people are going
to be searching for don't just do it's
great to do subscription box openings
but how long really is somebody gonna
watch your December subscription box the
opening not how long is anybody really
going to be looking at that maybelline
mascara that's brand new not very long
but if you can get together you know on
elf brand review okay of all your elf
products that you own or if you can get
together and do a celebrity tutorial on
a celebrity that's really popular some
people search for those things so do
those Pinterest Pinterest tests those
things are hugely popular right now and
hardly anybody does them make videos on
things people are going to search for
alright done with that topic the last
tip that I have for you is using a
website called socialblade.com hashtag
not sponsored once again I checked my
social blade
at least every other day and their
social blade has a lot of really cool
features they have an app and I'm gonna
go ahead and pull the app up for you so
that you can see what I do okay so here
is the app they have their news on there
the news doesn't really matter what you
want to do is you want to search for
yourself so I'm going to type in Jen
Lowe's reviews and you have to have like
five subscribers or something like that
for this to even work so I'm gonna go
and search my username and there's my
username okay I can see what my grade is
if you are AC that means you're pretty
much like most people on social Blake
most people on social blade are some
kind of see I see a c-minus a c-plus
okay it tells you how many subscribers
you have how many video views you have
and then it tells you about your growth
of your channel
so right now last month I was way down
in my growth way down this month I'm up
so sub growth is 57% view growth is 23%
it tells you your estimated earnings
okay and if this is the awesome snooping
tool as well if you want to snoop on
your favorite youtubers and you want to
know how much they're making and how
well they're doing on YouTube this is a
fantastic snooping tool so if you're
like that go for it I know I snoop on
people you can't help it I mean I want
to know how I'm doing compared to other
people which is very dangerous to do but
I get very curious so it says I make
between $97 and 1000 dollars per month
what I found is what I make is about
half of whatever that top number is
because right now I'm making about five
hundred dollars a month so about half of
that number so it says up to $14,000 a
year I make about half of that which is
about seven thousand dollars a year okay
it also tells me my average video views
my average number of subscribers and
then what's really cool is this one
right here is monthly so what you can do
is you can look and see how many
subscribers you've gotten every day and
also how many views you get every day
it'll also tell you at the bottom on the
social blade website it'll tell you your
average number of views per day and your
average number of subscribers per day so
this is very very interesting like I got
a spike here 135 and 166 subscribers on
two days that was when Tati
laughs guru released her video about the
contest for her to go hang out with her
in California while a lot of people
found my channel thanks to subscribers
of mine nominating me for the contest so
I had spikes and my subscribers and I
can see that I also had a spike in video
views that day that people were not only
coming from Tommy's channel and
subscribing but they were also coming
over and watching my videos which is
super super cool and then you also have
an easy link to your most recent videos
now another thing you can do on the
social blade website which is super cool
but very very dangerous is comparing
yourself to other people so one person I
compare myself a lot to is Cassie from
thrift thick who is one of my great
friends on YouTube I've always had I've
never told her this but I've always had
a mental competition with her her in
Victoria Donald uh we've always kind of
been neck-and-neck Cassie's kicking my
butt right now so fun to watch her
growth I mean she's just kicking it
right now and I just like it makes me
cheer for her I'm just so excited but
you can actually graph your growth
against somebody of a similar channel of
yours and see how you're doing in
comparison with them which is kind of
cool you can also check and see your
growth over time so you can see whether
you are getting more subscribers than
you were last year you can look and see
if you're getting more views than you
were last year you can see what your
trajectory is if you continue to grow at
this pace where will you be in two years
where will you be in five years where
will you be in a month it's a really
cool website it's really really cool I
really do feel like if you really want
to track your YouTube growth socialblade
is essential to finding out the best
information about your channel and
snooping on other people it's kind of
fun too so that's my advice my top 10
things for how to improve your YouTube
channel without spending any money I
hope you found this video helpful and I
hope it wasn't too long and long-winded
but I mean I was really excited to make
this video for you and I think I just
kind of up up up a little bit too bald
but hopefully you enjoyed it if you did
definitely make sure you subscribe for
more videos and thank you so much for
watching mad love and I'll see you in
the next video
