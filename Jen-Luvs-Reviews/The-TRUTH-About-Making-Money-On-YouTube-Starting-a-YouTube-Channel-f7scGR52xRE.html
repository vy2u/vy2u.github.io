truth series let's talk about the truth
a little bit here because I think
there's an issue and the issue is that
there's a lot of misconceptions about
how much youtubers make there's some
information out there but most of the
information that is out there is about
large youtubers and how much large and
tubers make and I feel like a lot of
people get involved with YouTube and
they start YouTube channels thinking
they're going to be able to immediately
quit their jobs and do YouTube full time
without any real concept of what smaller
youtubers make my main motivation for
this video is they tell you the truth
about what youtubers really and truly
make and we're going to go ahead and get
started with that right now a long time
ago I did a video called the truth about
making money on YouTube and being a
beauty guru I did that a long time ago
and it was based on my knowledge at that
point and YouTube at that point and I
felt like it was time for a revamp of
that concept with a lot more information
for you about how youtubers make money
only youtubers know what they truly make
but there are so many rumors flying
around about what youtubers make that I
wanted to bring some factual information
into this to give you a realistic
viewpoint on what youtubers really and
truly make
a lot of people think subscriber number
is directly correlated with how much
money a youtuber makes and that is so
not true at all
hi youtubers really make their money is
through views and every time an ad is
shown before a video that is how a
youtuber makes money they make ad
revenue let's do a little a and B
example so for example let's look at a
website called socialblade that's a
place where you can check out any
youtuber statistics and get an idea of
how many views they have how many
subscribers they have how many views
they're getting per month subscribers
per month it'll also give you an
estimate of how much money they're
making per month let's go and take a
look at youtubers a and B they both have
about the same number of subscribers
about the same number of overall views
but if you look at YouTube or a they
have had a lot of subscribers recently
they've also had a lot of video views
recently where if you look at this
number here you notice that youtuber a
is making about four times as much money
as youtuber B but you wouldn't know that
unless you saw in their social blade and
looked at it that's why it's really
important not to just judge a channel
based on how many subscribers they have
or how many total views they have but
how many views are getting per month is
really about how much money they're
going to be making we're gonna get into
other ways that youtubers make money in
just a minute
I felt like a great place to start for
this video is telling you how much money
I make on Adsense for YouTube let's
start off with where I started my first
four cents were made on October 29th of
2012 yes my youtube channel has now been
around for five years by the end of 2012
I had made 36 videos and my videos had
earned a total of seven dollars and 94
cents
thirty-six videos and I'd learn earned
less than eight dollars now on May 31st
of 2013 I did a video that was a parody
of another video that went viral
well that video did very very well
especially for a youtube channel that
was very very small and I made 84
dollars and 61 cents in one day from
that video after the hype dinah off of
that video that video quickly died and
it hasn't made any money hardly since by
the end of 2013 I had made a hundred and
twenty two total videos and I've made
one thousand twenty three dollars and 76
cents that's two to three videos per
week and my most profitable video of the
year was the truth about making money on
YouTube so I mean yeah a thousand
dollars is a lot of money but I had also
invested a ridiculous amount of time in
uploading over a hundred videos in that
year
so now let's go into kind of where I am
now I want you to take into
consideration that this is now my
full-time job this is what I do I work
at least 40 hours a week most of the
time more than 40 hours a week working
on YouTube videos for this channel so
keep that in mind we're gonna talk about
my monthly views for this past August
that's currently September so we're
gonna talk about last month I had about
five hundred eighty-five thousand video
views last month and I made about $1,700
so I did a very simple math algorithm
and figured out that five hundred
eighty-five thousand divided by 350 was
about how much money I had made so about
one thousand six hundred seventy one
dollars which I felt like was close
enough then I went to my friends on F
cos which is a creator community on
Facebook I was gonna use my goofy little
algorithm that worked for me to figure
out whether it applied to everybody else
I ask people from anywhere between a
thousand views in a month to 500,000
views in a month and this is what I
learned first of all it made a huge
difference for how many video views
total in the month versus how much money
so if I ask someone with let's say
15,000 views in a month they were making
about half as much money per view than I
was which I thought was kind of crazy
because you would think that they would
pay the smallest creators the biggest
percentage but no they don't it seems
like the more views you get the bigger
percentage you get the bigger the more
money you make per thousand views it
seemed like anybody under fifty thousand
views a month was getting this lower
rate and then it slowly seemed to build
up to kind of where I was at five
hundred thousand views a month but it
wasn't exact for everybody so that has
to do with keywords whether people
actually clicking on the ads things like
that they give variations between
channels but I just wanted a general
idea so if the trend goes this way it
seems like people that have much larger
channels than me I mean at 500 some
thousand views a month that is not a lot
compared to a lot of youtubers I wonder
whether those people are making an even
bigger dollar amount per view than I am
and I would imagine they probably are
so a big question is is how many views
you truly need in order to do YouTube
full-time and I think this is really
important because I think that a lot of
people like I said earlier get into
YouTube thinking they're gonna be making
a lot of money and then when they don't
they get frustrated they get upset they
feel like a failure and then they quit
making money on YouTube is not the
reason to start a YouTube channel the
reasons to start a YouTube channel would
be maybe to help people or because you
enjoy being in front of the camera or
because you love you love a specific
topic because you find personal joy in
it not because you want to put your
success on how people react to what you
do when someone subscribes it's a
reaction to what you do you have no
control over that you have no control
over whether if someone clicks on your
video to watch it I mean you have little
things you can do like you know make
your thumbnails better and make your
content better and you know connect with
the community and things like that but
overall you have no control over what
your individual viewers do so to bring
it down to reality based on the
information that I gained from those 15
youtubers and my own personal experience
you're gonna need about one and a half
million views a month in order to make
40 to 60 thousand dollars a year on
YouTube which to me is a pretty average
income for a person these days some
people may think that that's a lot of
money some people may think that that's
not a lot of money it just kind of
depends on what your current situation
is keep in mind youtubers continue to
make money off of their videos as long
as they continue to get views so the
more videos a youtuber has uploaded the
more chance that they are making money
off of older videos for a new youtuber
don't have any old videos to make money
off of so there's less chance of making
that money so you're really gonna need
to have a lot of video views off of your
videos you're putting up now well the
question is how many video views would
you need to get on average per video so
what I calculated was comfortably you're
gonna want to get 50,000 views for every
new video in order to make about $50,000
a year and how I calculated that was
50,000 divided by 365 equals $137 per
day and then I multiplied that by 350
which was my number
which was an average of 47 thousand 945
daily average views
okay now let's bring that back to me
personally I've been on YouTube now five
years and I'm uploading nine videos a
week and I'm averaging about 19,000
views a day so yeah nine videos a week
five years worth of videos and I'm
getting 19,000 views daily but all is
not lost along with YouTube Adsense
which is one way youtubers can make
money there's lots of other ways that
youtubers make money and you may be
familiar with some of them there's tons
of websites out there like Fame bit and
grapevine where youtubers could go on
and they can develop partnerships with
brands where the brand will pay them and
or give them free product in order to
create a video or we'll talk about in a
minute Instagram snapchat and all of
that on Fame bit in order to be able to
see all of this you need to be a creator
of a certain number so I will tell you
the biggest numbers I've seen for paid
sponsored content for a channel is ten
thousand dollars for a video the least
I've seen layer on there is $100 per
video so I guarantee you there are some
youtubers that are making ten thousand
dollars for one sponsored video
youtubers that are getting between a
thousand and five thousand views on a
video are not getting that I'll just
I'll just leave it right there another
great way for youtubers to make money is
through affiliate links and this is a
way that is great for newer youtubers or
smaller channels because the company
isn't out anything
initially they just give you a
percentage of the sale you may have seen
people say I am an affiliate for this
company or I have an affiliate link
below or I have a code below usually
that means the youtuber is making
between like 10 to 20% of the sale on
your purchase through the Amazon
affiliate program let's say you click a
link to buy a mascara but then you
decide you're going to buy a camera
where a television set that youtuber
actually gets a cut of that as well
there's also tracking cookies so if you
go to two-face calm and you buy a couple
of things after clicking on referral
and then a few days later you decide to
buy something else that youtuber
continues to profit off of your
purchases you also might have seen
bigger youtubers collaborating with
brands so they may be getting a
percentage of their sales they also may
be getting a flat rate off of the top so
that's another way but in order to
collaborate with a brand you have to
prove that you have some kind of
influence in order to gain influence you
really need to have those view counts
and those subscriber numbers to prove to
brands that there you are going to sell
things for them along with YouTube being
a platform a lot of youtubers are also
on Instagram on snapchat on Twitter
people can get paid money for posting
Instagram posts some people make a lot
of money and posting pictures on
Instagram also you know talking about
products on snapchat talking about
products on Twitter you can get paid per
tweet I know you all have seen the PR
hauls that's another way youtubers can
save money mostly because they don't
necessarily have to go out and buy
anything because the companies are
constantly sending them products you
wonder why youtubers that are sent a
bunch of PR you see the same products on
their channels it's because why would
they go out and purchase something when
they've got these boxes and boxes and
boxes of makeup sent to their houses
every single day or to their pio boxes
every day why would they go out and
purchase something when they're drowning
in product I mean can you imagine
getting 60 boxes of product in a couple
of weeks I mean what do you even do with
all of that stuff I know it would
overwhelm me I don't know about you but
why would you go out and purchase
something when you've got all of that
that you can choose to review at no cost
to you so it's hard to say well I know
you you spent your company's money
sending this to me but I'm not going to
review it I'm going to go out and buy
this thing instead it doesn't seem
logical in the reviewers mind but in the
consumers mind it seems absolutely
logical because you can learn about a
variety of products but you can see
where from the youtubers perspective it
may not be logical to go out and buy
things from indie brands for example
that don't have the money to be sending
out a ton of PR packages the last one I
wanted to talk about was something that
isn't as popular in beauty as it is in
other communities on YouTube which is
patreon and super chat people in the
beauty community
shredded for using patreon and for using
the super chat super chat is a feature
you can turn on in YouTube live chat
that will allow the youtuber to accept
donations toward the channel I
personally have been shredded before
turning on super chat even though I made
it apparently clear that no one was
being forced to do it no one was being
asked to do it I wasn't I wasn't you
know begging anybody for money but if
people wanted to donate and I would give
them a shout-out in the video and I
would tell them what they helped me to
purchase people had a lot of problem
with that youtubers of course when they
have a patreon and when they have or if
they use super chat they can choose to
use the money any way they want that can
be another way of earning income a lot
of people think of it like a tip jar if
you enjoy people's videos then you can
give them a tip one thing that was
really interesting that I heard a
discussion about about this topic was
that we you know we pay for cable we pay
for television shows we pay to go to the
movies would we now look at the actors
and the directors and be mad at them for
taking our money in order to pay for the
work that they've put into what they've
created when youtubers say hey this is
an opportunity for you to support my
channel it's seen as being greedy and
selfish and it's just to me personally
to bring my personal opinion into this I
feel like that's absolutely ridiculous
especially when you're talking about
grown adults who have a choice of what
they want to do with their money and if
they choose to donate I don't see a
problem with that where I do have a
problem with as if youtubers are
manipulating and lying in order to get
money then I have a truck I have trouble
with it but if they're out front about
it and say hey you know if you want to
support the channel cool if not that's
cool I have no personal problems with
that if you don't like it then you don't
have to donate you know what I mean also
with patreon there's all different kinds
of little perks that you can earn when
you are a monthly supporter of a YouTube
channel one of my youtube subscribers
had said that she said in some way
followers feel they should have some
sense of control they feel they're owed
something from the influencer in some
way because they follow him or her when
she climbed to success it takes away the
credit for hard work that the person did
behind the scenes to get their make
content make connections
cetera and I totally agree with Elena on
that one we are in a society where I
feel like we always want stuff for free
we always want to be able to get things
for free we want free shipping I am
guilty of that we want you know discount
codes and we want 20% off and we don't
think about the cost that it takes to go
into things and that's it for the last
piece that I wanted to touch on was the
cost of things along with the money that
you're gaining there's also a lot of
overhead fee there's the camera and the
equipment and all of that if you aren't
getting sent product or if you choose to
go out and purchase product there's that
on top of it if you're part of a
multi-channel network or an MCN that
company takes a percentage of your
Adsense fees in exchange for different
fees and services that is something I
have never done I've never had any
desire to do do two horror stories that
I've heard about MCN but that is a fee
and there are this is something that a
lot of people don't know is that a lot
of the bigger youtubers have agents they
have people that they pay in order to
get them gigs in order to get them brand
deals things like that they kind of shop
them around to different brands and they
pay those people in order to help them
to make connections I'm not knocking any
of these things I'm not saying any of
them are bad but they are a cost to the
youtuber and depending on the channel a
lot of people are noticing that their
videos are being demonetised which means
that YouTube is saying that they are not
ad friendly and those videos cannot make
any money that doesn't happen it seems
with beauty videos as much as it does
with topic style videos News style
videos things like that but that is
something out there that is possible
actually that wasn't the last thing
there's one more thing I wanted to touch
on and it's how you the viewer help
youtubers to make money things that you
do in your actions that help youtubers
the biggest thing you can do to support
youtubers is to watch their videos and
to watch them for a long length of time
YouTube loves it when people sit on a
channel and watch it for a long period
of time now I don't suggest that you do
this but just so you know when you click
on an ad or when you let an ad play all
the way through the youtubers percentage
for that view does go up sharing the
youtubers videos with people who will
also watch those videos is also huge
because it increases views it also may
increase subscriber number and also
commenting more comments actually equals
more engagement according to YouTube
along with the YouTube likes when you
hit that thumbs up button that helps you
the YouTube algorithm say that hey this
is a good video it's an engaging video
so when you see people say the snapchat
fam go on and leave you know snake
emojis or heart emojis or whatever is
that is helping the youtuber to show
that their audience is engaged I don't
see that as being a terrible thing but
if you think that that's a bad thing
just so you know that's what I feel like
the motivation is for a lot of people
creating their snapchat fans or their
Twitter fans or whatever is to get that
engagement up on YouTube videos the more
engagement there is on a youtube video
the more likely youtuber is to share it
with other people that are new viewers
I'm gonna end this video on a thought
from my friends summer who's part of the
community she says I find it odd that
people obsess over it meaning money as
if the amount of money someone makes
automatically correlates to something
else like how much loyalty one must have
to followers how much content one must
post etc and I couldn't agree with
summer more I feel like as a human race
we're always trying to simplify things
we're trying to cut down the workload
for our brain but the consequence of
that is that sometimes we make over
generalizations and the over
generalization here is if you have a lot
of subscribers you're getting a lot of
views and you have a good Channel and
you're making a lot of money and
hopefully I've shown you today that
subscriber numbers is not what it's
about it's about your view count and if
you were thinking about starting a
YouTube channel I hope this has given
you a realistic perspective on how much
money that you could potentially make
and what it would take for you to make a
sustainable living on YouTube the other
thing is if you want to snoop on people
if you want to go that route go over to
socialblade and you can kind of poke in
my algorithm and get a little estimate
on how much youtubers could possibly
make that's the gossip side that I
didn't want to focus this video on but
no judgement if you want to take it that
direction so I want to thank you so much
for watching this video I hope you
enjoyed it if you did definitely make
sure you hit the subscribe button down
below I do have a Truth series playlist
that I will link at the I that you
should be able to see I think right over
there
if you'd like to watch more videos in
the truth' series i'll also be linking
below my face the last video in the
truth series that people seem to really
enjoy it it's all about how companies
market to us that kind of trick us into
buying things that we don't really need
again I want to thank you so much for
watching and I'd love to you and I will
see you in a video soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
