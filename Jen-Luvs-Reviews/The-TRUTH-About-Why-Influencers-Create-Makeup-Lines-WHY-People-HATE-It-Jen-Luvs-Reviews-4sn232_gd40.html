for you today and they may be
controversial opinions but they're my
opinions and I really want to hear your
opinions on this topic you may have
noticed that a lot of influencers are
starting their own cosmetic lines we've
got manny anyway is now announced he's
starting one Tati announced that she's
starting one Kristen dominique has her
logo out Laura Lee released her palette
ishani from total makeup junkie 101
released her lipstick line a while ago
Nicole Guerrero released her skincare
line there's just all of these cosmetic
companies coming out created by
influencers and I know some people are
very excited about these and some people
are really mad about this so let's just
have a talk about it we're gonna we're
gonna go ahead and start that right now
where I want to start this video is why
I think this is happening and my theory
is is that all of those people except
for ishani I believe I think all of them
all have YouTube as their full-time jobs
being a youtuber I can tell you this
we're all independent contractors which
means that YouTube doesn't really owe us
anything we can basically get fired at
any time or kicked off of YouTube or
have our videos demonetised and that's
all up to YouTube it's not a very stable
job if YouTube died tomorrow then what
would we all do we'd have to do
something else is what we'd have to do
so my thought is that one big reason why
youtubers are coming out with their own
cosmetic lines is because of something
called day first of fiying income which
basically did it be the short version of
his is don't put all your eggs in one
basket as a business person where
YouTube is considered a job of business
it's good to have different ways of
getting income especially if your main
source of income is so unstable like
YouTube is unstable especially right now
with all the D monetizing and everything
it's just very unstable so that's one
big reason why I think all of these
creators are coming out with their own
lines I'd love to know what you think
the other reason is that I feel like
it's just it just seems like a fun thing
to do you know like can you imagine like
you know creating something that is all
the things that you
always want in a makeup product you know
you design the packaging and the texture
and the the finish and the colors and
the all of that you know creating
something from nothing and then putting
it out there for people to purchase I
mean to me that just sounds like a whole
heck of a lot of fun so that's another
reason why I would think that people
would enjoy making their own makeup
lines there are a lot of other theories
that I've heard about why creators are
making their own makeup lines and one of
them I feel it's big is people say well
they're just trying to make money and I
don't know how you feel about this but I
feel like there's nothing really wrong
with wanting to make money I don't know
I feel like we all kind of want to make
money I know I wanna make money I want
to vote you I don't know anybody that
doesn't want to make money you know
money makes things so much easier money
doesn't buy happiness but money sure
does make things easier money allows you
to have more freedom to travel and
freedom to buy things that you want and
all of that so I I don't see money being
a motivator as a bad thing I've also
heard creators be accused of trying to
manipulate their subscribers into
spending their hard-earned money I can
see this point of view and and where I
can see this point of view is if a
creator is making something and
marketing it as one thing but then
selling it as something else you know
marketing it as a good quality product
but then everybody gets it and it's
terrible and my personal experience with
the products that I've tried that our
Creator created not not collabs I'm
talking that collapse collabs are a
whole nother thing but you know created
by creators such as you know the Laura
Lee eyeshadow palette the shawnee
lipsticks the nicole bros skincare line
I've got my review coming out next Oh
Friday Friday it should be coming out I
already filmed it I feel like they're
all like good quality products are they
gonna be for everybody no I mean I don't
think any product is gonna be for
everybody I know one of the big things
that I've heard people say you know you
could be the juiciest peach ever and
there's always going to be people who
don't like peaches you know not there's
gonna be no product that's gonna be for
everybody so with these particular
influencers I don't see it as a taking
advantage of their subscribers I feel
like they're capitalizing on their
subscribers but I don't know if that's
necessarily taking advantage
I see that being a difference I don't
know what do you think I've heard this
especially talked about when people have
younger audiences that they're you know
taking advantage of the younger
subscribers but I feel like even with
kids teenagers and kids I feel like when
you've got money to spend you have to
make you know and somehow you have to
make a choice about what you're going to
buy and then take responsibility for
that choice I know that when I buy
things a lot of times I'll look up
reviews on the product you know no
matter what it is whether it's you know
an electronic that I'm looking to buy or
even a new restaurant that I want to try
out I'll look up reviews it's one of
those things part of being a responsible
consumer is looking into what you find
so again I don't see that influencers
are taking advantage of their
subscribers because I feel like you know
we need to take responsibility on what
we purchase you know what I mean I don't
know that's just how I feel about it
another huge critique that I've heard is
what gives them the right to create a
makeup line or skincare line or whatever
it is when they have no experience in
this I mean they're just screeding
makeup videos on YouTube you know they
don't they're not professionally trained
they they've never gone to college for
this stuff I know there are a lot of
people that feel that way totally feel
that way I'd love to know if you feel
that way down in the comments because
again I really want this to be a
discussion from my perspective and what
I've seen I don't think that any of
these people are going into the lab and
formulating this stuff they have
professional chemists that are creating
the product so I feel like when people
go at that argument that who are they to
create the line I'm wondering are they
thinking that the people are going into
the lab and creating like that you know
Laura's going in and she's mixing
eyeshadows and Nicole's going in and
she's you know putting chemicals
together for a moisturizer like if they
were doing that then I can kind of see
that perspective but they are hiring
professionals to do these things and
really their main job from what I've
seen is to test the product and say
whether it's good or not whether they
are enjoying it or not
whether it's the texture that they want
the scent that they want things like
that I don't think that it's the same as
making your own cosmetic line if you
know what I mean there's other people
that are doing all the work and then
they're just testing it yes it comes
from their own ideas of what's good but
they're not actually formulating
anything at least from my knowledge I
don't think that they are so I don't
really get the whole like who gives you
the right to create something when
you're not a professional if that makes
sense for example my husband he created
a he started his own business when he
was 24 years old he didn't have a
business degree didn't even have a
college degree and decided to open up a
tattoo studio he just figured it out and
did it and now he has one of the most
successful tattoo studios in the state
so I kind of see the influencers kind of
being like that where they've got an
idea of something that they want to
exist and they're making it exist and I
personally think that's pretty cool I
don't know that's that's just my
perspective I would love to know what
your thoughts are on that because I
don't know I feel like they do have a
right to do it you know like that it's
just a matter of wanting something to
exist and then making it exist and I
don't feel like for me personally that I
have the right to tell them that they
don't have a right to create something
that they want to create you know in any
and firstly I feel like it takes a lot
of guts to create your own cosmetic line
because number one it's a lot of
financial investment when you're doing a
collab with a company the company
typically puts up all of the money up
front but when you're creating your own
line it's all you you're investing in
the lab creating the formula because
just creating the formula is extremely
expensive then you're investing in the
actual makeup or skincare that's going
into the packaging that you're also
paying for and you have to order X
amount ahead of time so you're investing
thousands and thousands and thousands of
dollars ahead of time just hoping that
this stuff will sell if you're doing a
collab you have no worries you have no
you know you just have to sit back and
relax and wait after you've finished you
know collaborating with the brand so I
feel like putting a makeup line out
there is a lot of risk and I think that
it's pretty cool that people are willing
to take that risk so at this point I
want to hand it over to you what do you
think you feel like these influencers
are getting what they deserve as far as
the blowback from creating their own
cosmetic lines or do you feel like it's
overdone and that they shouldn't be
getting as much as they are I would love
to know what you're thinking thank you
