at this point one youtuber somewhere or
another in the news on Twitter on
Instagram on YouTube complaining about
the YouTube ad pocalypse so today I'm
gonna break it down for you tell you
what's really happening
how creators are really being affected
what I think YouTube's motivations are
and what maybe you can do to help
support your favorite creators so if
you're interested in that keep on
watching because we're gonna get into
that right now I get asked all the time
when people say you know what do you do
for a living I make videos on YouTube
and they're like you make money doing
that and like yeah actually I kind of do
so let me just kind of explain that to
you real quick just in case you aren't
sure about that when an ad runs before a
YouTube video the creator makes a
fraction of a penny off of that ad we
also make money off of youtube read
subscriptions that's a $10 a month
subscription that removes ads for the
viewer but still gives money to the
creator I have a video on my channel
called the truth about making money on
YouTube and starting a YouTube channel
that really digs deep into how much
individual youtubers get paid per view
and how much we get paid per video and
how much some creators may be making I
break down exactly how much I make so if
you're interested in that part I will
leave a card in the I there and also
link it down below in case you want to
know more about that there's lots of
ways youtubers make money other than
Adsense but what we're gonna focus on is
Adsense revenue which is the money that
youtubers make off of the ads that roll
before their videos basically what
happens is is an advertiser comes to
YouTube and they say we want to run ads
then they get to pick what kinds of
content they want to run their ads on so
for example a makeup company will
probably want to run ads on my channel
but probably not a gaming channel based
on my title my tags my video description
mic my thumbnail YouTube figures out
through something called the algorithm
what my content is about and they try to
match advertisers with my content along
with that youtubers also have a little
bit of choice over the ads we can
restrict certain kinds of ads like if we
don't want sensitive topic
being shown on our videos we can block
that we can block gambling ads things
like that which I personally have
blocked on my channel we can also choose
the frequency of the ads and the
placement of the ads that's relatively
new where you may have noticed that the
number of ads within a video has
increased well that has been placed by
the youtubers about you know 6-7 ads
within a 15 minute video but it does
make a huge difference on that youtubers
paycheck from Adsense when there are
multiple ads playing so that's why
they're including all of those ads and
they're counting on that you will
continue to watch beyond that ad and
actually I have heard that we actually
get a bigger cut of profit from a
YouTube red subscription than we do from
an ads like I mentioned earlier the ads
aren't placed by a human being they're
placed by an algorithm that just kind of
ad analyzes each individual video
because there really can't be a human
looking at all of these videos there's
just too much content going up on
YouTube so because of that that leads us
into the ad pocalypse which started in
March of 2017 when advertisers realize
that their content there their ads were
being placed on videos that they did not
want to endorse such as maybe videos
about terrorism or videos about content
that they thought was a sensitive topic
videos containing hate speech and
bigotry and things like that the
advertisers went nuts a ton of them
pulled out and YouTube lost a lot of
money what YouTube decided to do was
they were going to add stronger filters
for what videos got ads and which ones
didn't get ads so we're gonna fast
forward a few months to the summer and
we started seeing as creators these
little green circles with a dollar sign
popping up next to our videos and that
meant that our video was deemed
advertiser friendly and what then
happened is within 24 hours of the video
going live that green circle turned
yellow which meant that it was either
going to have limited ads or no ads at
all on the content now this is critical
because most of the views of a YouTube
video happen within the first 48 hours
so if you get dinged with Dean
cessation in that first 48 hours you're
having very few ads of any ads at all
playing on your content you're still
making money off of YouTube bread but
that's such a small amount of YouTube
viewers compared to the masses that are
watching videos so the money goes down
significantly because there's no ads
playing if there's no ads playing you're
not making any money
now how YouTube is finding these things
is like I said with the title the tags
the description they also might be using
the closed captioning the automatic
closed captioning that can pop up on a
video if you've ever tried to turn on
closed captioning on someone that didn't
put in their own closed captioning
you'll see that it's not very accurate
but if they see cuss words popping up
over and over again it's possible that
they are flagging those videos for D
monetization as well but it's an
extremely strict restriction at this
point for example any video that this
says unboxing is automatically flagged
for D monetization I don't know why
there's tons of things I mean monthly
favorites videos in the beauty community
you know unboxings like I mentioned
makeup hauls things like that are
getting flagged as not advertiser
friendly and it's hard to figure out
what it is that's triggering the
algorithm when you put drugstore in a
title of course we don't mean drugs we
mean drugstore that one would get
flagged this is also hitting people that
do support videos that like my friend
Cassie over at thrift thik she had put
up videos about her struggles with
mental health issues and things like
that all of those videos have been
permanently demonetized as not
advertiser friendly when they're
supposed to be educational videos and
they're supposed to be support videos
for people that are also going through
the same thing so that's kind of sad
that those videos or deemed advertiser
not advertiser friendly at all it's
important to note that we don't get any
kind of notification if a video is
flagged for D monetization so it's our
responsibility to make sure that we are
checking our videos and there is a way
to filter our videos to kind of sort
them by the ones that do not currently
have ads on them so YouTube makes it
relatively easy for us to find them we
just have to kind of stay on top of it
we notice that a video is now flagged
for D monetization we can click the
request review button and
it'll take anywhere from a few hours to
a few days for the video to be Romana
ties but like I was mentioning earlier
that first 48 hours is critical because
that's when we're getting most of our
views so for example I had a boxycharm
video that got flagged pretty much right
after the video went live and I made
about half - a little less than half of
the money I would have made if the video
hadn't been flagged based on the other
videos that I've made
it'd have about the same amount of views
but weren't flagged for D monetization
so that was kind of disappointing to me
it just feels like kind of cruddy you
know because it feels like I should have
gotten that because there's nothing
wrong with my content I don't cuss on my
channel there's nothing inappropriate I
purposely put on my channel things that
are family friendly so that moms and
dads can watch their videos with their
kids around and not have to worry about
the content being inappropriate so me
being you know so conscious of that it's
you know almost hurtful to the accuse of
being advertiser friendly even though at
this point I'm not taking it personally
in the beginning I kind of was it's like
YouTube doesn't think I'm advertiser
friendly but I promise you I am so it's
not just the ones that the people that
cost that are getting flagged it's
everybody at this point almost but
here's another clincher that happened a
couple of weeks ago a bunch more
advertisers pulled out because ads were
running on videos that were targeting
children so what these channels would do
which would get them a lot of views both
from children and also maybe from adults
who were looking for really twisted
content would be lets say they dress up
a man a spider-man and a woman as Elsa
and the next thing you knew spider-man
and Elsa were doing things that they
they're not family-friendly oh my gosh
like what I will link Philip defranco's
video on this down below where he talk
goes more in depth about this these
kinds of videos and why advertisers were
pulling out their ads so this is the
problem is that videos like my unboxings
and my monthly favorites and my makeup
minutes are being demonetised where
videos like that are being monetized so
there's something wrong there's
something going on and YouTube has got
to figure it out another thing that I
wanted to mention is that this is real
hitting the smallest channels the most
in that if you don't have more than 1000
views within I think a weeks period of
time then you can't you can hit the
request review button but they say that
they won't review it some people on my
Twitter have told me that it has been
Ramana ties but not everybody so I don't
know how why some people are getting
their videos we monetize even if they
have less than a thousand views but
people with smaller channels have told
me that this is really hitting them hard
in the very beginning of this video I
mentioned you have to hit that hundred
dollar threshold in order to make any
money on YouTube so this is making it
even harder for smaller creators to hit
that hundred dollar threshold in order
to make that money I will tell you it
took me about a year to hit a hundred
dollars and that was without all of this
D monetization so and that was uploading
you know at least four or five videos a
month so you can see where this would
really be a problem for those new
up-and-coming YouTube creators is this
affecting me and my channel yeah it's
affecting me I'm losing you know ten
fifteen dollars twenty dollars here and
there but think about how much it's
affecting the creators that have really
big channels they're losing thousands
and thousands and thousands of dollars
having these videos see monetized during
this critical time so why is this
happening
YouTube says that they are just
filtering for advertisers they're making
sure that every all the content is
advertiser friendly that's the purpose
behind it they say that the algorithm is
learning through the Shema interaction
and that recently I forgot to write down
the date but very recently they said
that 30% of the videos that have been d
monetize are now going to magically be
monetized because the algorithm has
learned I haven't seen any change I've
actually seen my videos be more likely
to be flagged for D monetization over
the past couple of weeks that I had even
before actually at one point my friend
Stephanie Nicole had advised me actually
when I went to go visit her you know
take the tags off your video that's how
they're finding it and I took the tags
off my videos and for like two weeks all
my videos were monetize I was like yes
and then all of a sudden they started
being d monetized again once they had
said that all those videos were gonna
start being Ramana ties all my videos
started getting flagged at that point so
it's like oh my gosh
can't even win then something really
interesting happened last week a video
came out it was called YouTube secret
codes revealed and I will link that
video down below what they said in that
video is that there was a group of I
don't know it's a group of people was
like a group that did a study and they
found that if you went into the code of
YouTube into the metadata into the HTML
of every of any video which they'll
explain the explaining that video how to
do it and you search for excluded
underscore ads you could find these
YouTube secret codes that would tell you
why videos were being demonetised for
example 102 is profanity and rough
language 104 sexually suggestive content
109 sensational and shocking 113 tragedy
and conflict and 115 sensitive social
issues so if you looked in your code
you'd be able to find that information
there so you would know why you were
flagged so what I did was I went into my
metadata and I went into a bunch of
youtubers metadata and I spent about
three hours just digging and digging and
digging and trying to find out why
videos were being flagged and it was
actually quite interesting I'm gonna go
ahead and put up a little chart that I
made of the different codes that we were
being flagged for so I started off with
eight channels including mine so I
analyzed my channel man emu a Totti
Laura Lee James Charles raw Beauty
Christy thrift Thicke and my friend V
over at v-- dreamcatcher so lots of
different levels of viewership a lot of
bigger channels I wanted to see what was
going on with the bigger channels cuz I
was curious I was planning on digging
digging deeper but I will tell you in a
minute why I didn't do that
so you'll notice that I was dinged for
102 which is profanity and rough
language and that was on a makeup minute
I don't get it either
you notice that man emu a was not dinged
for profanity and rough language in the
videos that I looked at which is odd
because he cusses his face off in his
videos so I was very surprised that he
was dinged actually less than I was for
demonization Tatia was only dinged for
three different things those are ones we
don't know unless it's one of those one
o things 100 somethings we don't know
what that ding actually means so Toddie
only has three for some unknown reason
on every
of Lorelai's videos that i looked at she
was getting dinged for tragedy and
conflict who in the world knows why
James Charles actually be out Laura
though for the number of codes that he
had on his content he had the profanity
and rough language but he also had a ton
of other ones on there Rob UT Christie
who also cusses a lot in her videos did
not get dinged for rough language on the
videos that I saw she had five different
codes Cassie from thrift Thicke had six
different codes I thought that was kind
of interesting I made sure to look at a
bunch of her different content I looked
at her muck bongs I looked at her toy
openings and I looked at her beauty
videos she had six different codes under
her and none of them in the 100's and
then my friend V from V dreamcatcher who
also doesn't curse in her channel she
also got profanity and rough language so
this is what I'm thinking I don't know
how they said they looked at eight
hundred thousand YouTube channels as far
as finding out what these codes meant
YouTube never confirmed that the
findings were real and based on what I
the limited amount of research I was
able to do it doesn't seem like those
codes are accurate to what these videos
are just for fun I decided to look at a
couple of other channels that were not
UD related that continually talked about
being d monetized so I looked at Philip
DeFranco which is a news channel and
then I looked at Kendall ray who does
conspiracy theories and you'll see Phil
only got dinged for five different codes
and Kendall got eight different codes
she was dinged for sensational and
shocking which is very much the content
on her channel and also for sensitive
social issues which is also what her
channel is like so that makes sense but
the fact that myself and V were flagged
for profanity and rough language but
Manny and Kristie were not does not make
sense to me but I will tell you if you
were interested in that and you're
running to go find these codes don't
bother because I was talking to Taylor
over at that Tayla on Twitter and she
sent me a screenshot of a Twitter post
by someone that is from h3h3 productions
his name is Ethan and he had had contact
with YouTube and I will put the screen
capture up right now of what they said
the stuff in this video isn't accurate
I agree it was an amazing and
entertaining video and then they start
talking about something that I'm not
going to get into about the yellow icon
and suppressing videos I won't get into
that you can watch their video for that
if you want more information on that but
they say that we remove the codes to
avoid for their confusion so at that
point I could no longer research and the
codes no longer exist and we're back
completely in the dark with no path at
all so this in this research kind of led
us on a path to figuring out why our
videos were being demonetised
and then they turn the lights off that's
a more like okay we're back in the dark
so now I want to kind of get into my
theory of why this is happening and it's
a little bit different I think that
because a lot of advertisers a lot of
really big advertisers pull their ads
from YouTube that YouTube now naturally
has less ads to run okay they also
recently instituted like I said earlier
that you could put multiple ads in a
video taking out some time in that first
48 hours from almost every video
uploaded to YouTube helps them to
streamline those ads that they do have
two videos that will be advertiser
friendly that have been approved by
either the YouTube algorithm or by a
human that has reviewed them and I feel
like if those advertisers came back that
we wouldn't have to worry about as many
videos getting flagged I think that
YouTube knows they're over flagging
content they have to know they know
they're over flattened contents but
they're doing it anyway and that's my
theory as to why they're over flagging
content is so that they can take those
as that they have and make sure they put
them on videos that have been approved
they can also use that they're being so
strict as a marketing tool toward
avatars to say hey this is all that
we're doing here to make sure that your
content Dervin your ad is gonna be
placed on things that are good quality
but this is also an opinion I don't
think YouTube cares I honestly don't
think YouTube cares about the small
creators on YouTube that aren't making
it to their hunting one-hundred dollar
threshold I don't think they care about
people with a hundred thousand
subscribers like me I feel like they
care about their advert
they care about their stockholders
that's who they are worrying about and
those people want to advertise on huge
channels people that have huge long
watch times lots and lots of subscribers
network television shows that are now
being shown like you know the view and
the Jimmy Kimmel and all of those shows
you know are being shown in clips on
YouTube now those are the ones where the
advertisers want to go they'll do
everything they can to bring those
advertisers back but if we suffer in the
long run as far as the money that we're
earning so be it that's just the way
that it is when my subscribers Courtney
who follows me on Twitter she says what
are your thoughts and the way YouTube is
going will you be touching on that in
your video so I will go I will touch on
that Courtney and what I'd like to say
about where I think YouTube is going is
I think that YouTube is going in the
direction of larger creators you it's a
really hard ceiling to break through on
YouTube it's always been hard and I
think it's even harder now than it ever
has been to get to be making any money
on YouTube and to call YouTube a career
is going to be even more difficult I
think that smaller creators are going to
get more frustrated and start dropping
off and the bigger creators are going to
continue to get bigger and bigger so
this is where you come in and what I
think that you can do to help and that
is to share your favorite channels on
your social media with people that you
feel would enjoy the content share the
people that you love watch the people
that you love if you feel like you want
to sign up for a YouTube red
subscription because that is a way that
you can not have to watch any ads you
get access to the YouTube red content
which you may or may not be interested
in and youtubers do make more money off
of your views that way it's just
something you can do if you choose to am
i begging you to sign for YouTube red no
I don't want anybody to see
don't don't twist it okay I'm just
telling you different ways you choose to
do what you want to do and what you feel
comfortable doing I know that I'm going
to sign up for YouTube red account I
never had before but I am going to now
that I've done the research and know the
benefits to creators and also I'm tired
of the ads I'm tired of seeing you know
ads in a video it drives me bonkers and
that will eliminate that for me so now
make me very very happy as a YouTube
viewer will I be starting a patreon no
absolutely not I will not be starting a
patreon I don't want you to worry about
the content on my channel my channel is
doing just fine as far as the amount of
money that I'm making my husband is the
main breadwinner in the family so don't
feel like anything is going to change
with my content even if all of my
YouTube Adsense went out the window just
know that I would not close down my
channel I would get a job and my content
would change but I would still be
creating content for you no matter what
I'm not going anywhere so now I'm going
to turn the conversation over to you
what are your theories as far as YouTube
and ads and how all of this is working
and do you feel like your viewing habits
are going to change based on what's
happening with YouTube right now do you
feel like YouTube cares about creators
and wants to help us to grow and be
better on the platform or do you feel
like they're really on the side of the
advertisers like I had mentioned if you
disagree with me I would love to hear
what your point of view is because I'm
just one person and we are the
collective brain of makeup awesomeness
and other information awesomest because
this doesn't even have to do necessarily
with makeup it's just a general
conversation I would love to know your
thoughts and let's think on this
together I'm also going to be linking
all of the channels that submitted
information for me about their videos
being D monetize I'm gonna list all of
those channels down below thank you to
everybody that helped me to put this
video together I appreciate you so much
they're all people that follow me on
Twitter so if you're not following me on
Twitter that's where I kind of go off at
the mouth about stuffs if you're curious
about that side of who I am and my life
