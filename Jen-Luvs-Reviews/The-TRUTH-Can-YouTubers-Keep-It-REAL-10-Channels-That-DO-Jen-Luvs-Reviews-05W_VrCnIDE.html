beauty space I can feel it it's coming
and I'm about to break it down for you
right now I'm not sure if you've noticed
this but some channels are starting to
get some backlash for not being let's
just say transparent about the lack of
quality of some of the products that are
coming out these days there are a lot of
assumptions and thoughts about why
people are doing this so what I'm gonna
do for you in this video is I'm gonna
talk about kind of the influencer
mindset and how that can influence a
dishonest review and I'm also going to
be telling you some channels that I feel
like are amazing and wonderful for
getting that no BS I'm not going to be
bought by a brand kind of review I've
got five for you that have under a
hundred thousand subscribers and then
I've got five for you that have over a
hundred thousand subscribers now I'm
perfectly understanding that some people
don't go on YouTube to get information
that's valuable maybe you're going on
YouTube just for entertainment purposes
only there's plenty of entertainment out
there if that's your purpose that's not
what I'm talking about I'm talking about
today people in the beauty space that
are presenting information so that you
can be educated about your purchases
those are the videos and channels that
I'm talking about and just know that I
am not judging any of these channels for
the choices that they make everyone has
a right to handle their channel any way
that they choose just because I do
things a certain way on my channel
doesn't mean that everyone should do
what I think is right so let's go ahead
and get started into the motivation
piece so this is this is what I believe
from my own perspective and my own
thoughts and things that I have thought
myself and idea that I have fought with
in doing an honest review because it is
it can be difficult to be a hundred
percent honest when you especially first
start getting brands sending you
products for PR and I feel like some
brands are very very good at targeting
smaller channels in that they give these
products to these smaller channels and
they're so honored and thankful to get
the Prada
that of course they're not gonna say
anything negative about the brand but
don't get me wrong there are channels
that are bigger channels that do the
exact same thing you know they're they
see the stars in the shine in the light
of being on a PR list and that kind of
blinds them to giving a 100% honest
review it can be almost euphoric to get
these packages in the mail a free
product I mean it's it's wonderful
so it's really hard sometimes to not
then have a bias toward that brand is it
hard yes is it possible not to have a
bias toward a brand that sends you free
PR absolutely and that's what I'm gonna
talk to you about about these channels
because they all do it some channels
though I feel like maybe it's not that
they're being dishonest it's just that
they're not being thorough people that
take things out of a box and they put it
on their face real quick and they look
in the mirror and they say this looks
amazing and then they put it out as a
recommend personally that is not
something that I feel is a good way to
talk to viewers about products I don't
think that that's responsible it's one
thing if it's a first impression review
and you clearly say it's a first
impression review like I'm totally cool
with that but just the like very quickly
slap something on your face five minutes
after you bought it and to say that it's
a recommend that that gets to me a
little bit I feel like that's creators
we need to make a choice we need to make
a choice of where our loyalties lie do
our loyalties lie with the brands in
that we want to get as much PR as
possible we want to get the products
before everyone else to increase views
on our channel we want the brand's to
like us and repost us so that we can
grow is that where our loyalties lie
or do our loyalties lie with our
subscribers in that if we're known for
giving an honest review people will
continue to watch and continue to
support and subscribe and share and all
of that so you've got two ways that
you're feeding the success of your
channel from the brand perspective and
then also from the subscriber
perspective and the line here is very
difficult to dance it's very difficult
to dance one way people dance is that
they choose not to review products that
they don't like and again I'm not
judging anybody that does this I'm just
saying that's one way people dance with
line another way people dance with the
line is to give just half of a review
just say the positives without saying
the negatives but that's more on the
brand friendly side so let's go ahead
and get into these channels that I think
you should definitely be watching if
you're looking for the most honest
subscriber friendly reviews these are
the channels I feel like we're up and
coming these are the channels that I
feel like are changing the tides they
are the ones that are bringing us into a
new era of YouTube beauty videos and I
am so thankful to these channels for
coming with me on this journey because I
do feel like I have one of those
channels that's kind of bringing us into
that honest realm so we're gonna go
ahead and start off with live loves her
makeup I'm gonna go ahead and show you a
clip of live or real quick just so you
can kind of get a feel for who she is
really good and I don't mind spending
fifteen to eighteen dollars it's like
getting a golden ticket when you find
like a coupon you rip it off and bring
it up to the register you know even with
the coupon code I would still purchase
this bronzer the more and more butter
bronzers are my all-time favorite
bronzer formula but some of their other
products in their collection you know
they're eyeliners some of their mascaras
a lot of stuff just is way too over
price you know I have to tell you I live
kind of has grown on me she comes off as
very intense but the fact is is that
lift gives really good information she
gives a very unique educated perspective
and I feel like I have to be in the
right mood to watch live because she is
a little bit intense I mean she's got
these piercing blue eyes that like see
into your soul and she and she just
gives she doesn't edit and she just kind
of goes buppa buppa buppa but I mean you
think I talk fast and give you lots of
information live is like oh like head
and shoulders better than me at bad at
giving you a lot of information in a
short period of time she's amazing but
but it's just her perspective is just so
interesting because we don't always
agree on everything but I really
like that she has tested and thoroughly
thought about her ideas before she's
come on camera so I think live is
definitely an up-and-comer you look at
her number of subscribers and the amount
of views she gets on her videos it's
disproportionate in the number of views
she gets I mean her subscribers love her
and watch her and I definitely recommend
you check her out second channel is
Samantha March and she did actually
recently do a collaboration with live
one thing Samantha I think has a huge
advantage she's really good at makeup
she's really good at tutorials her
Instagram is also really good she does a
lot of those little short Instagram
tutorials that are really good if you
like tutorials but her review videos her
videos where she talks about what she's
gonna buy what she's not gonna buy I
find them to be extremely helpful I'm
gonna go ahead and show you a clip of
Samantha now yeah
stoked stoked right here this girl is
excited for this palette I saw this one
I saw the tags I saw the photo I saw
what it was I was like yes it is in my
cart at Ulta right now I am so excited
for this I recently picked up my first
Urban Decay afterglow highlight shade
isn't sin I picked it up for the trying
ask my subscribers favorite and makeup
video so I tried it and I was like oh my
gosh I need more of these highlighters
so Samantha seems like a channel you
think that you'll enjoy definitely
recommend you check her out as well the
next one is a love I seriously like I
have number one I can't watch this
channel around my children because she
cost us her face off
number two I can't watch it around
anybody just trying to focus on anything
because I'm laughing so hard this is
makeup struggles all right makeup
struggles I wish I knew what her real
first name was I don't think she's I've
ever seen a video where she said what
her real first name is she is one that
she had there's no line for her as far
as dancing a line with a brand she
doesn't care I mean it's very very clear
she is a hundred percent on the side of
I don't care about the brand's all I
care about is giving you the best
information possible which is what I
absolutely love there's a video she did
recently which I really enjoyed that I'm
going to show you a clip of real quick
it's of her reorganising different
palettes that she felt like were just
the color selection was just not good
and I was so excited to see this video
from her because she has such a good eye
for
color and and organizing things and and
I just really love to see her
perspective and how she would change
some of these pallets so here's a clip
of that video it's really good it's
really really good let me say something
they don't do all two phases like all of
you we got a billion dollars we're gonna
do one we're never the one two places
that allow parent a parent-teacher
conference and they know that their kids
are bad but they are going to defend
their children and continue to raise in
the same way they've been doing because
they don't give guys to face to face is
that parent that's not willing to
progress because there ain't no way
there ain't no way they're playing with
us they are playing with us in our
emotions so that's makeup struggles if
you think you would enjoy your channel I
definitely love it whenever she uploads
it's like one of those ones where it's
like automatic I'm gonna watch this
video a hundred percent the next one is
one you may not have heard of but I'm
telling you she is one that you gotta
watch out for her name's Georgia Harris
and there was a live chat a while back
where I was crediting makeup struggles
actually was think it was my aunt aha it
was crediting makeup struggles for
information that I was giving about I
forgot a couple of different products I
know it was like a tart palette where
she had called it like the bird poop pal
or something it wasn't makeup struggles
it was Georgia Harris and Georgia came
in my comment she was like John I think
that was my video not makeup struggles
Oleg oh my gosh so for the record I love
makeup struggles but I was actually
quoting a video that I had just watched
by Georgia Harris I'm gonna show you a
clip of that video right now and then we
have this thing which apparently it's
called like the Becca like radiant
radiant glow or something they might as
well just called this the Becca rooftop
shingles highlighter so this thing gives
me anxiety because there's like five
different colors it's all shingle II I
don't get what the shingles was it's
like bad snake skin dragon scales
you basically have to swirl this product
together because if you go in any other
way you're gonna get like chunks of
different
if you do want to have separate colors
you can't go in with us like a
highlighting brush you're gonna have to
use an eyeshadow brush to get in there
and like get the tweezers and pull it
apart and put the surgical table down
and get the overhead light and the
scalpel to cut out the sections you want
to use it's just no I don't want to deal
with it I just want a regular highlight
I just want regular highlighters with
one colored pants not only is giorgia
hilarious but she is so thorough and fun
and different and I love her I
absolutely love her she the reason why I
found her it's cuz she's one of my
subscribers she follows me on Twitter
and she mentioned something about making
a video and I checked it out and I
immediately fell in love just really
enjoying her channel I think you're
gonna love her she recently did a video
deep hiding the Kat Von D Saints inner
palate and reorganizing it so if you're
interested in that I will link that one
down below as well along with the one
that I just showed you just a really
really interesting video to see how she
deposited it and also how she organized
it it was really cool I'm the last one
under a hundred thousand is Lauren may
beauty this is another one like makeup
struggles where she is
there's no like I'm thinking about the
brand here like she is all about the
subscriber she does a lot of those
videos kind of like Nikki Murphy if
you've ever seen Nikki marking Nikki
Murphy's been around forever but Nikki
Mervis another really good one but she
does a lot of videos where she kind of
breaks down community issues she's very
much presents herself not necessarily as
a Video Creator as much as a video
watcher but I think that's a very unique
perspective and a neat and unique spin
on the beauty video to really break
things down from a viewers perspective
and I think you're really gonna like her
I'm going to show you a clip right now
and now that it's like popular to make
these PR videos I think that's great but
what I can't stand is them complaining
that they don't get PR from certain
brands like at this point you are so
successful that you're getting just so
much makeup to your inbox and if you
don't get something from someone guess
what you definitely have the means to
buy it you know and I think that's my
biggest thing it just it feels so out of
touch with reality especially when you
think about how much money people are
spending on makeup who don't get these
PR packages who just
of youtubers and love the beauty
community they're buying all this makeup
with their hard-earned money money that
they're they're not even making nearly
as much as you're making and they're
spending their money on all this stuff
you get for free so um it's it's just
kind of like tacky to me to complain
about not being on a PR list I mean I
love about Lauren May beauty is that she
is just no BS she tells you how she
feels and she's really smart about it
you know the way that she's thinking
about things and it makes me go oh I
hadn't thought of it like that like when
I did my Jacqueline Hill video that
people either really really loved or
really really hated she did a video very
similar to that one but did it in a much
better way that that odd the way that I
should have done it which was to be more
general rather than to be specific I
will link that video down below and she
just does a really good job of breaking
down information so if you like my truth
series you're gonna love Lauren May
beauty and bonus check out Nikki Murphy
- she's great
alright let's switch gears a little bit
and we're gonna go into channels over a
hundred-thousand that I feel like are
just really changing the game and I feel
like these channels are super super
important because they do have the most
reach more reach than these smaller
channels like me who just broke a
hundred thousand and you know the
channels under a hundred thousand these
are the channels I'm counting on to hold
on to their integrity I feel like
they've all proved themselves to be
extremely honest I'm gonna keep
Stephanie Nicole out of this list
because I think that's kind of a given
that you guys know how much I love
Stephanie I just did a collaboration
with her and I'm gonna keep her off the
list but kind of like my Nikki Murphy
for my under a hundred thousand over my
over a hundred thousand is Stephanie
Nicole my first one that I really want
to mention to you is Jackie ina and if
you haven't seen Jackie aina I've
mentioned her before in other videos I
just admire her integrity and she's one
that goes on brand trip she's one that's
worked with different brands and I feel
like she has held on to her integrity
and one of the videos I really love from
her was her milk makeup review she
bought a bunch of whip milk makeup and
she reviewed it honestly the brand not
only watched her video but now they're
improving their products based on
Jackie's recommendations and I feel like
that is what this is all about is
providing information not just to the
viewers but also to the brand about how
to make products better I'm
this is like a win-win so I feel like
Jackie being at the number that she's at
it's kind of a leader of this movement
and I just really appreciate her so if
you haven't checked out Jackie I'm gonna
go ahead and insert a clip right now
we'll go back to my channel it's a girl
I've been mean to do a full face of milk
makeup for quite some time now milk
makeup from what I've seen and
discovered so far it takes a very like
model on-the-go approach to makeup you
know the whole appeal with the silicone
applicator is it supposed to say product
and you know you don't waste any drop
but like that's the point of using
sponges is you don't want all the
products on your face you know like I
want a little bit of I feel like I put
on a hell of lot that's why I don't like
about these sponges now I'm remembering
like it doesn't fall back a little bit
you know I'm like I don't really want if
I give two pumps if I make sense I don't
really want to pumps foundation like I'm
a woman what do you expect I never know
what the hell I want do you really think
I want full coverage no I had the
opportunity to meet raw Beauty Christy I
guess it was right before she was in the
NYX face awards or right after she
started in the NYX face awards I found
her right before and I just became
hooked on her channel if you haven't
seen Christy she is so incredibly
talented with makeup that is her thing
like she is so good but what she's
really been doing lately which I think
has pushed her to the next level is her
reviews her reviews are very similar to
mine and Stephanie's and that she talks
about price for grams she talks about
she does the swatches she does the look
and she just did a prism palette review
and somebody commented very
appropriately underneath if Christy
can't make it work no way I'm gonna make
it work I'm paraphrasing here but I just
I feel like that's kind of the way I
feel about Christie's videos and that
Christy is so incredibly talented if she
can't make a palette work or she can't
make a product work the chances are I'm
not gonna may be able to make it work
either so if you've never seen Christy
check her out right now you guys today
I'm going to be doing a full face of
first impressions on a new makeup
products it's like broken and it doesn't
want to
ah you okay so it doesn't really have
much of a scent if anything it sort of
smells like like the YMCA like it looks
like it's being full coverage right but
you can totally see my skin peeking
through and it's almost as if when I pat
over the top of it it's like coming up I
would say that the name of this
foundation is a liar invisible is more
like completely obvious you're wearing
foundation we're moving on to Alyssa
Ashley she's just so chill and so nice
and so calm and she's so stinking
beautiful like she's really pretty she's
really really talented but she's also
not afraid to keep it real just like
Jackie she's done a lot of
collaborations she's done one with elf
her lip gloss she worked with Nick's on
their palates she's now working with
makeup geek for their new collection
she's she's been in it but she's still
not afraid to be honest which I truly
appreciate she's very thorough in her
review she really thinks about what
she's gonna say and I just appreciate
her a lot and I appreciate what she's
bringing to the beauty community
so check out Alyssa right now I'm gonna
go ahead and show you guys how I've got
this look using the palette and just my
overall review on the palette itself and
if it's worth your money is it a concept
or is it cancelled we're gonna find out
so my favorite I would say out of all
the shimmers it's definitely gruel only
because it's such a nice green the only
thing I would say about rule though is
that the texture of it is different and
the other shimmers in the palette and
it's a little bit chunky so you want to
be mindful when applying it because it
will have some fallout but aside from
that the color itself is really pretty
the last two are gonna be no surprise
because these are channels that I have
admired for a very long time the next
one is my inspiration for this channel
my original inspiration Emily Noel 83 I
like I even get choked up talking about
Emily and what oh my gosh am I gonna cry
no Jen this is stupid why would I cry oh
my gosh I think it's just because like
she means so much to me you know oh my
gosh really this is happening right now
I had no idea that was gonna happen
we made a hold off on Emily for a minute
let's go back to Emily for a man because
I don't want to cry in this video that's
that's stupid why would I cry I'm just
an emotional person let's go on to the
next one and we'll go back to Emily once
I've called my face down so let's talk
about Jessica from Jam Beauty 89 just as
always trait stayed true to herself
really really great channel just very
good at you know talking about products
from a user standpoint she does a lot of
drugstore which I really really
appreciate because I feel like even
myself I'm really gravitating toward
those Sephora brands where she has
always done a lot of drugstore she does
some lion stuff every once awhile but
she really keeps it real with the
drugstore and I think that's awesome
because if we can find excellent
products at the drugstore like the NYX
epic ink liner that I'm wearing today
that's amazing that's just as good as
the high-end like that is where I want
to be and I definitely I mean she had
the opportunity to definitely be biased
toward different brands but she's not
she's real she's to the point and I'm
gonna go ahead and show you her right
now is this Jessica and today I have
empties for you alright next empty is my
ELF hydrating bubble mask I really liked
this stuff do I think it was like the
most hydrating mask in the world no but
it's enjoyable it's not crazy expensive
it's kind of dirty but you push this I
think there's a little bit left yeah
there is you push this and the product
comes up into it you put it on your face
yeah you put a thin layer all over your
damp skin and after a minute or two
bubbles kind of start to form and it
kind of tickles and feels good it's I
think more fun and effective but it is
fun and if you've never tried one like
this it I mean it's pretty affordable
and it's just cool so that is Jessica
let me see if I can go back to Emily
without like getting all blue okay so
Emily
I remember watching a long time ago she
did a video where she was talking about
this was years ago about the two-faced
teddy bear brushes and they were sent to
her and she didn't like them and she was
honest about it and I was like oh my
gosh I mean this was when I was just
starting to get PR set to me I was like
if Emily can do this I can do it and
that's the way I feel about her I feel
like she shows
me she showed me that people could get
products for PR and still be honest she
doesn't do any sponsored content at all
if you haven't seen Emily no led3 she's
just celebrating her 10 years on YouTube
I don't know how you haven't come across
her by now but if you haven't for some
reason seeing her check her out right
now hey guys thank you so so much for
being with me today in this video I am
going to be tackling Oprah's Favorite
Things I love her I respect her but I'm
going to give you my true honest
thoughts that you come to my channel to
find I'm gonna give that to you in this
video first this is what's inside 25
whipped lip products I'm really picky
with lip color textures especially these
matte liquid lipsticks some of them I
have no patience for you know like the
ones that just dry down and they feel
completely uncomfortable I am so
thrilled to say that I love this formula
it's a combination of a wonderful
formula and also the delivery method or
the tip you know the way it goes on your
lips is so so good so as you can see I
have an emotional attachment to Emily
very emotionally attached to her content
she is just if you look at her videos
from five six years ago and you look at
one now she's the exact same person she
is one that has is basically captured in
time as far as the original awesome
YouTube beauty reviewers from when I
first started watching Beauty videos and
to me she's the only one that I used to
watch back then that I still watched
today and it still makes videos I don't
know what else to say about Emily other
than I just she's amazing she's like I
was saying a minute ago there is a
misconception out there that people
can't do sponsored videos can't get PR
products and still be honest these ten
channels and I hope you find my channel
to be contrary to that I just did a
video a sponsored video for fabfitfun
and then the end of the video I said
straight up I wouldn't have bought this
box for 50 bucks and that was my honest
opinion and it was a sponsored video
what I care about is having a good
YouTube channel about feeling proud
about what I'm giving to you as far as
the infirm
I'm presenting to you and I feel like
these ten channels are on that same path
this is not a hashtag brutally honest
movement okay because we already know
that when just because someone puts
hashtag brutally honest doesn't mean
they're actually being brutally honest
what this is is a movement of people
that are just genuinely trying to give
you good quality YouTube content and the
way that you can support that content is
by voting with your views people say you
know you vote with your dollar on
YouTube you vote with your views at this
point I'm going to turn the conversation
over to you I would love to know some of
the channels that you counts on for
those 100% honest transparent I don't
care about the brand all I care about is
you
videos I want to know who you're
watching so that I can start watching
some of those channels that I might not
have discovered if it weren't for you
thank you so much for watching this
video if you enjoyed it which I hope you
did go ahead and give it a thumbs up
that makes me look super cool in the
YouTube algorithm and helps my video to
be more likely to be seen by people on
YouTube that are not subscribed so I
appreciate when you do that and you can
also subscribe if you want to see more
videos from me I do put out 9 videos per
week 5 makeup minutes which is makeup
news and then our what's at the make up
a weekly makeup new show on Sundays and
then I do 3 other videos per week that
are like tip trick review videos those
typically come out on Monday Wednesday
and Friday unless something happens
where you know the schedule gets off a
little bit for the most part it's Monday
