channel and you know me you know that
I'm a very honest person and I have a
video called the truth about making
money on YouTube and being a beauty guru
and that's one of my most popular videos
because I think a lot of people don't
really talk about making money on
YouTube so I want to address another
kind of controversial topic which is
sponsored videos and affiliate links and
things like that and my personal
experience with those my personal
opinion about those I'm kind of nervous
to shoot this video because I don't want
to offend anybody but I feel like I
there's a lot of misconceptions about it
and those misconceptions are come from a
lack of communication and a lack of
knowledge about what all of this is and
what all of it means when a person is
sent stuff from companies I don't know
if you can tell my voice but I'm very
nervous to shoot this video let me give
you some definitions so sponsored video
means that the user is paid to do the to
do the video to make the video they're
given actual money and I've heard of
people getting up to ten thousand
dollars or more in order to do a review
these are the big-time people to do a
review of a product and I've heard that
I have never been paid that I get
promotional box and a subscription boxes
I get I have affiliate links and I'll
tell you what those are that's when you
click a link or you use a code and then
the company gives the video creator a
percentage of the sale so for like
needing west's I get 3% of the sale
which is I think no I got three dollars
I get three dollars off of every Nadine
West subscription when people start up
using my link one comment that I get a
lot a lot on my videos multiple times on
my videos is thank you for being so
honest though I appreciate those
comments they make me a little bit sad
because I feel like that shouldn't be
something I have to be thanked for that
should be something that should be the
standard on YouTube and that's just my
personal opinion that there shouldn't be
a question as to whether people are
being honest in their making of their
videos I mean what
the point of making a review video if
you're going to be dishonest about the
products you're reviewing but you know
when you get someone that's reviewing
something you need to be able to trust
that they're not being paid I think that
you know when you've opened up a
magazine you don't know whether that
company has paid for that space in that
magazine you would hope that the
magazine is putting that product in
there because they genuinely think that
it's a good product but do you really
know and I feel like with YouTube videos
we're just regular people and I think
that's why the beauty community is so
big on YouTube is it you're talking to a
regular person who has use the products
instead of you know going to a magazine
where you're not sure so the fact that
some beauty gurus I hate to use that
word but some beauty video creators are
not being honest really disturbs me and
and there's no real proof that people
aren't being honest except for there was
one there's one that I do have proof and
I'm not going to mention the person's
name but about a year and a half ago
about a year and a half ago I was
recommended a product by a very popular
beauty guru and I hate using that where
I don't know why I keep using it by a
very popular video beauty video creator
she recommended this product she said
that it was amazing so I bought it and I
got it and I'm like am I doing this
wrong is it something wrong with me like
what is up with this product like I
can't get it to work the way that she
said it was supposed to work now a year
goes by right and I watch a video of her
talking about that same line of products
and how much she hated the product she
had recommended now it's possible that
she changed her opinion over time but
what I noticed was back at the original
video
she had an affiliate link to that
company I was very disturbed to think
that she had lied in that video about
the quality of the product and saying a
year later how much she disliked the
product if she didn't fully test it or
she changed her mind over time but
either way I at that point I felt like I
could no longer trust her to give me
honest review so I immediately
unsubscribed
another thing that I've seen and heard
rumors and all these things because you
know you hear things is about people
that get sent products for free that
they guarantee product reviews to be
positive and that I can guarantee you
does happen I've had companies contact
me telling me that I need to guarantee a
positive review and I always tell them
no I always tell them no because there's
never ever ever am I going to guarantee
somebody that something's going to be
positive I'm going to guarantee you all
honesty and if you can't handle that you
will not have a product review on this
channel well I'm assuming that that
happens that there are these guaranteed
patas positive product reviews because I
have gotten companies contacting me
expecting me to do that so I'm assuming
they're getting away with it on other
channels the other thing that bugs me
about people when they get sponsored by
a company is when they go through the
review of the product they do not
mention that they have been sponsored by
a company or they do have they have an
affiliate link when they earn money off
of purchases from the website they don't
mention it but yet in the description
there is a unique code that is their
name they got that unique code that is
their name from the company so from that
I assume that if I use that link there
will be some kind of tracking of that
person's sales whether it be for
informational purposes or for monetary
benefit of the video creator there's no
way to know but just the fact that there
is that connection between the company
and the video creator I would appreciate
it if people would include that in their
videos I feel like there's a level of
dishonesty there that really bugs me now
I've seen people jump to the defense of
people who do not disclose that they are
sponsored by a company we are we are
guaranteed protection by the FTC that if
somebody is sponsored by a company that
that is disclosed in the video the
reason why that is there is to guarantee
the honesty of the video that we are not
lied to or misled because someone has
been paid
to promote a product no matter how much
I love someone no matter how much I love
someone if they do not disclose that
they are being sponsored by a company or
that they are have an affiliate link I
do not trust the review because I feel
like if they're not disclosing it that
they are being sponsored then I don't
know whether they're going to be honest
that's why in every one of my videos I
say I promise I will be I was given this
product for review I promise I will be
honest about what the you know the
colony you know how it performs you know
can you believe me I mean can you
guarantee that I'm going to be honest no
I mean there's no way I could totally
lie to you about it but I'm not going to
do that and I feel like if you disclose
that you are working with a company that
that gives a level of honesty that makes
me want to trust the review I don't want
to waste my 5 or 10 minutes or 15
minutes or sometimes 20 minutes watching
a review and then realizing that I'm not
sure whether it was even worth watching
because the person was sponsored by the
company so that is why that protection
is there and and that's why people are
supposed to disclose and I don't think
that always happens on YouTube which is
a little disheartening another thing
that I've seen happen is people say you
know this wonderful product above a
little blah blah blah and there may be a
discount code down below maybe there may
be a discount code below maybe there's a
discount code below because you're
affiliated with them because they gave
you a discount code what do you mean
there may be a discount code come on
really I just think that that's kind of
crazy what are you doing what are you
doing another thing that people ask me a
lot is how do I get companies to send me
products and this is the thing I
originally when I first started making
videos was hoping the companies would
send me products for review because it
gets expensive and you know buying all
these products to review it gets
expensive so it you know you don't you
start running out of cash to fund your
channel at least I did so you know you
want you would really like for things to
be sent to you promotionally I don't
contact companies
very rarely do i can't say i don't i
very rarely contact companies for review
usually they contact me but that didn't
happen until month 10 of me making
consistent videos i was making them for
ten months
actually that's not sure there was one
company that contacted me before that
now his hips he had bands and i'm not
sure when that was but that was one and
that was maybe three or four months into
making videos but then I did not get
another offer until ten months later
until ten months into making videos and
that was boxycharm in it was their
second boxycharm ever I don't know how
they found me I don't know why they
chose me but I'm really really thankful
to have developed a relationship with
boxycharm very early on
he's somebody s and he sent me an email
recently and was like how did you become
a professional subscription box reviewer
and it's like I don't really know
actually at one point I said I wasn't
even gonna review subscription boxes
anymore they just started contacting me
but what I want to do now is I do want
to show you the text that I send to
every single company that contacts me so
if you're someone who is contacted by
companies you can see what I tell them
and you can feel free to steal it copy
and paste it into your emails that you
get from people so here it is here this
is what I say and I feel like this kind
of puts me in the clear
for giving an honest review I remember
when I first started getting project
review I was really nervous about saying
something negative because I didn't want
to offend the company I didn't want to
look unprofessional by saying that a
product was not good I didn't want to
you know I knew someone had worked hard
on it and I didn't want to make them
sound like you know they worked hard on
something and now it's terrible but this
is the thing is is how are they gonna
get any better how are they gonna know
if their product needs improvement if
nobody tells them you know so be that
person that tells them hey your product
could be better and this is how it could
be better but saying it in a polite way
you know I mean there's a way to say it
the best advice I ever got was from
Emily Noel 83 I commented on one of her
videos she had done a video about a
tarte was a tart note it was a Too Faced
makeup brush set and she basically did
not like it and she said it straight up
in the video that she did not like it
and I told her I was impressed with her
honesty and I'll put her exact words
down here of exactly what she said back
to me but basically they just was you
know nobody
learns from a lie nobody learns from a
lie so why do it and it was like ha I
love you and I will forever thank her
for giving me that advice to always be
honest because now companies know when
they watch one of my videos they see how
honest I am they know what the deal is
and if they don't like it they don't
have to send me anything and that's
perfectly fine with me I don't have a
problem with that you can't be in this
to get free products you can't be in
this for money because if you are in it
for that you're gonna burn out so fast
or you're going to be compromising a
heck of a lot you know emotionally in
order to make videos and it's just not
it's not worth it is what it comes down
to so if you have any other questions
though about any of this please just
leave them in the comments below I'll do
my best to answer them I am getting a
ridiculous amount of comments lately so
it's really hard for me to keep up on
all of the comments especially having
you know working full-time now I'm not
for the summer but you know working
full-time having two kids it's really
difficult to comment back to everybody
but I try to comment back to a lot so I
will try really hard to answer any
questions you have below if I have to
make another video like this I will to
clarify other things but I hope you
found this video helpful and informative
and if you did please give it a thumbs
up and make sure you subscribe if you'd
like to see more of my videos I promise
I'll be honest with you with the things
that I get you know that's what I do
it's you know and hopefully more people
will follow suit I mean I think that
there are a lot of really really honest
video creators out there but it's really
difficult to tell who's honest and who's
not so I strongly suggest those and even
to make videos to always be honest in
your videos the companies will
understand if you give them a little
disclaimer before they send you stuff
they will understand and if they don't
they won't send you stuff and that's
really not that bad because if somebody
is sending you stuff that means more
people will want to send you stuff and
there's no worries ok so don't don't
think that you know it's never gonna
happen for you again if you reject one
company because they don't want an
honest review it's better not to
compromise your integrity
rather than compromising your ability to
get a product for free you know what I'm
saying yeah that's what I want to say
about that thank you so much for
watching I keep rambling so I'm just
gonna cut it off now so mad loved you my
friends I hope you like this video
I will talk to you in a video soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
