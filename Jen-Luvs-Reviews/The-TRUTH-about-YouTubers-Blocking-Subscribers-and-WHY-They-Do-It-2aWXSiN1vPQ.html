time it's been since summer since I put
up a controversial video yes this is
going to be a little bit of a stinger
but it's got to be done because I am
tired of it okay so I gotta say it I got
to say it and I'm gonna say it to my
friends which are you people so who else
can I talk to if you can't talk to your
friends who else can you talk to so this
is the thing my girl Amanda who left me
some suggestions not too long ago to
wear some brighter eyeshadow I said to
her I said Amanda I I will definitely
try some brighter eyeshadow so we're
talking in the comments or whatever so I
am not mentioning Amanda in my box of
charm video and I told her you know
thanks for the suggestion lowball
whatever so she comments underneath that
video I'm gonna read it to you she says
can I just say you need a bit more color
I would love to see you with a smoky eye
just for a video and then you can wipe
it off please don't block me like what
what do you mean please don't block you
why would I block you like and then I
started thinking about it not like
because people block people for stuff
like that that's why she's worried about
me blocking her okay she's not the first
one there's a lot of people that are
like here's something that I think you
should probably do please don't be mad
at me I need suggestions how am I gonna
get better and and this is what makes me
mad is because there are channels out
there that will block you if you suggest
anything okay if you tell them you feel
like they're eyeliners a little off or
if you tell them you feel like their
contours a little off this is a comment
that I got okay it was a little stinging
at first I have to admit as a little
stinging but it says sweetie it looks
like you were putting on sideburns with
that contour brush higher with that
contour girl higher smiley face and then
she goes on to tell me a little bit more
about whatever the content was now first
when I read that I was like oh you know
kind of like a punch in the gut kind of
thing like oh my contour it looks like
doodoo right so I ended up taking her
suggestion and I put my contour higher
and I think it looks a lot better
so I thank her for that comment thank
you so much for that and I
think this is what's happening okay when
we make videos if you don't make videos
I'm gonna tell you this this is the way
that I feel and I've talked to a couple
of other video creators about this when
we make videos we're here by ourselves
it's almost like standing up on a stage
in a theatre by yourself and doing like
comedy you know you don't want anybody
to get the hook and pull you off you
know and that's kind of what happens you
don't want people throwing tomatoes at
you and we get comments that are like
tomatoes sometimes that are hate
comments like true hate comes i'm gonna
show you a comment that i got that's
rude and disrespectful okay I'm gonna
read it I got a look at it over here
this is what it said you're so dumb and
you think you're the best because you
have all the products and I don't know
what the ad was you're weird the way you
just do reviews weird and crappy okay
that is not productive that's not
helpful okay but what I realized when I
clicked on her name is that she's like
nine years old so what did I do that I
have to do I I commented under her
comment and I said you know who do you
think you are like saying that to
somebody what's wrong with you obviously
your mother does not supervise you on
the Internet
you know but she's this little kid you
know like she's just a little kid you
know and and and you know some people
would take that so personally I mean and
it's not all little kids it's grown
women too that are that are saying these
horrible things to people
and one more up there we're here by
ourselves putting ourselves out there
you know everything we do being
criticized from the jewelry we wear to
the clothes we wear to the big puff of
hair I had in the back of my head for
like four videos I mean like we're we're
every little thing is picked apart
because you all are seeing things like
you watch on TV but we don't have
somebody doing our makeup for us and
making sure our hair is in the right
place and you know we're looking at
ourselves in this teeny tiny little
monitor and we can't necessarily see
everything that you all can see so what
I'm asking you as people who watch
videos you may consider leaving a
comment is to understand that we're just
the person in our bedroom or a living
room without a crew so give us a break
but I also want to ask video creators to
give subscribe
Piper's a break too and understand that
a lot of people just want to see you do
better that maybe they have advice that
they want to give maybe there are makeup
artists maybe they just have 50 years of
experience putting on makeup you know I
mean eight you you've got to respect
people when they want to give you
constructive feedback like those couple
of comments constructive feedback I just
it just kills me that there are channels
out there that are breaking my
subscribers I've asking you video
creators do not black people who are
just trying to help you if you happen to
enjoy this video and you're not already
subscribed go ahead and click that
subscribe button below thank you so much
for watching mad love and I will see you
in the next video bye you know make the
world a better place and sing Kumbaya no
that's not what I'm saying what am I
trying to say here
I think I've done I'm done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
