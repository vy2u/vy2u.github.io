what do you think about subscribers yeah
I think subscribers are good - I love my
subscribers my subscribers rock I love
my friends I have been wanting to make
this video for a really long time this
is a follow up to my video the truth
about making money on YouTube and being
a beauty guru it's one of my most
popular videos that I have made I wanted
to kind of do a follow up about
subscribers and how people get
subscribers what has worked for me
personally and getting subscribers and
what has not worked for me what you need
to decide is what is your goal in
getting subscribers why do you want more
subscribers do you want more subscribers
because you want a following because you
want to be YouTube famous because you
want to make money are you trying to
just make some friends and make some
connections or you just you know want to
make videos so that people will watch
them because you want people to enjoy
what you're doing or you just want
numbers I mean some people just want the
numbers just enjoy seeing their number
go up decide what your goal is and
that'll kind of guide the path that you
want to go on it's no secret that the
more subscribers you have the more
popular you seem the more cool you seem
I think that it's complete bunk that a
subscriber count'
shows that you have better videos I have
unsubscribed for many people who have a
lot of subscribers because their videos
just turn into crap once they become
really popular on the contrast side
there are a lot of people that are
fabulous that have much less subscribers
and can't judge a YouTube channel by the
number of subscribers not at all it just
doesn't work that is the way that a lot
of people do judge people getting
subscribers is a focus of a lot of
people who do make Beauty videos on
YouTube but let's just cut right to the
chase and just talk about the different
ways that people try to get subscribers
I'm gonna go from the least successful
way I think to the most successful way
the least successful way that I have
noticed is to spam videos a lot of times
you'll see people comment on popular
youtubers and they'll comment and
they'll say check out my giveaway I have
going
and or I just started a new beauty
channel check it out I do reviews
usually gets flagged as spam it really
bothers a lot of people I do not feel
this is a very effective way of getting
subscribers on YouTube I have never once
subscribed to anybody who has spam the
video and usually I do check them out
but most of the time the videos I've
watched have been absolutely horrible
another way that people have used in the
past that is no longer available is a
video response now YouTube has just cut
off the ability to do video responses
which means you'll watch a video of a
popular youtuber and then and when you
went to go make a comment you could put
you know that you want to put a video
response and then that video would show
up underneath the video I used to use
that for best in beauty as a way for you
all to find videos you know the people
that were in the competition now
YouTube has decided to go away do away
with this feature but what they're going
to start doing is they're going to start
allowing you to leave a video in an
actual comment so that is another option
that you will have soon for getting your
videos out there of course it hasn't
started yet so I don't know how
successful that's going to be but I've
heard from people that leaving video
responses was a way that some people
felt was relatively successful in
getting a few subscribers okay another
thing that people do sometimes is they
will send YouTube messages out to mass
numbers of people and I have found this
to be very time consuming to actually
send out YouTube messages with a video
attached and I have subscribed to some
people based on the videos that they've
sent me and I remember there's a girl
named cookie monster or something like
that she makes really good videos I've
recently found her to be slightly
annoying so I did unsubscribe from her
but she's really popular she's really
fun she's really unique and I found her
through her sending me a YouTube message
now she's uber-stylish subscribers but
back then that was how I had found her
was through YouTube message so that's
slightly more successful than leaving
the comments another way that I don't
see done a lot but I've had some success
with is adding people as contacts it's
something that you can do very quickly
very easily just going into comments of
a video of where people have commented
on a popular youtuber and clicking on
their names and then just adding them as
contacts they may see you they may want
to subscribe to your channel based on
that I've had a few done a few
subscribers off of doing that it's not
super popular to do but it's really fast
it's really easy and it's not quite as
annoying because you're not getting it
in your inbox you're just getting it as
this person that's added you as a
contact you don't need to do anything
further blah blah blah so it's less
intrusive than sending a message or a
comment on a video now getting into the
ways that are a lot more successful
giveaways are another way to get
subscribers and when you require people
to subscribe to your channel in order to
win Jon's joining us for a little bit
because he just needs hugs and attention
so I hope you don't mind him
interrupting in this video you say hi so
going on um giveaways okay you require
people to subscribe to your channel in
order to win the giveaway now there are
some upsides and some downsides to doing
this the upside to doing this as you do
get subscribers from doing this you
absolutely do the downside is that when
your giveaway is over a lot of them will
unsubscribe so this is the key if you're
going to do that what you need to do is
make quality videos while the giveaway
is going on so that when they do
subscribe to you they see how awesome
your channel is and then they want to
stay subscribe even after the giveaway
is over
so definitely plus and minuses to the
giveaway thing but it definitely does
work the other downside of is it does
cost you money in order to do a giveaway
you have to buy the product and don't
forget shipping especially if you make
it International shipping can be up to
fifteen or twenty dollars to ship an
item so depending on how heavy it is so
keep that in mind another way that it's
fantastic for getting subscribers is to
do collaborations with other youtubers
and I'm gonna be quite honest with you
the more subscribers that person has the
more chance you're going to get more
subscribers for obvious reasons more
people are watching their video they're
sending more people to you therefore you
are going to probably get more
subscribers off of it but what won't
work is if your channel is not very good
people are going to come over they're
gonna watch your video and they're not
going to subscribe anyway so you need to
have quality videos along with
being in the collaboration with someone
else now not to say that you shouldn't
collaborate with people that have less
subscribers than you because it's still
a fantastic experience and it's building
networks with people and it is
increasing the community environment on
YouTube and it's it's just a wonderful
experience to collaborate and it's also
a way to gain subscribers in a really
solid way because if somebody subscribes
you usually they will stay in this kind
of situation the downside of
collaboration is it takes another person
to want to do it with you it's not
something you can do on your own another
fantastic way of getting subscribers is
to use your other social media the plus
side of this is it should really truly
build a network of people and they're
they're following you on Twitter and
Facebook and Instagram and I have keek
that I love and you know you really got
to can get to know people and have
conversations with people outside of
YouTube which is really nice the
downside is that is extremely time
consuming to keep up with all of the
different social media networks so you
really have to have a lot of time
invested in order to do that but it is
very beneficial and it's an excellent
way to get more subscribers the final
way which I think is the absolute best
way of getting subscribers is just to
make good videos and make a lot of good
videos because you never know which one
of your videos is going to take off and
be popular for me it was the
subscription box which one is right for
you and the Michael Todd anti-aging
video and the the tree about making
money on YouTube those are my three most
popular videos and they have gotten more
views in the past couple of months than
they did when I first made that months
and months and months ago so what ends
up happening is when you make a really
good video that people search for and
find which you almost have very little
control over but if people somehow find
that video then they start sharing it
and as they share it more subscribers
come to you and I have gotten a
ridiculous amount of subscribers off of
that how to make money on YouTube
because I don't think there are a lot of
videos out there I feel like it's a
strong video it's a solid video gets to
the point it gets out and it provides a
lot of really good information so I
think people were really attracted to
that video and wanted to see more of my
videos because of that so if you can
find something that unique
a unique topic people aren't really
talking about but one that's of high
interest people will search for it they
will find it and then they will
subscribe to you because of it that is
the hardest one I think to do because
there are so many beauty videos on
YouTube and it's so hard to find a
unique topic that no one's really talked
about yet that it's also something that
people are going to be searching for
another thing about getting subscribers
on YouTube is it is a very slow long
process if you expect to get subscribers
you know within you know making 5 or 10
videos it probably will not happen so
you really have to persevere and just
keep working on it keep making videos
appreciate the subscribers that you have
and our act with them and then maybe
they will share their your videos with
other people I wish you guys the best of
luck and gaining subscribers if you do
have a youtube channel and you would
love for me to check it out please put
that information down below and I will
definitely check out your look at your
YouTube channel I'm not gonna guarantee
that I'm gonna subscribe to all of the
YouTube channels because I only
subscribe to channels that I really
truly want to watch and I hate to say
that because that means that some people
I'm not going to subscribe to but if you
want to know on my advice on how to make
your videos better I would be happy to
give you any advice that you would like
I don't just give out advice unless it's
asked for just let me know and send me a
YouTube message or put it in the
comments down below I'd be happy to help
you out in any way that I can from my
limited experience on YouTube but anyway
