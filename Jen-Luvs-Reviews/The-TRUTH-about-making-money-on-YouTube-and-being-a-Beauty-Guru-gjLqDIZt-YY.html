video because it was something that I
always wondered and had some trouble
finding information about it online and
I just wanted to put it out there
because I think a lot of people are
curious about making money on YouTube
and how it works and I'm gonna go
through this as quickly as possible if
you have any questions after I'm done
just let me know down in the comments
below and I'd be happy to answer as many
as I can as you may know of most beauty
videos that I've seen on YouTube are
monetized which means that the ads that
are shown before the video and over on
the side of the video and also on the
bottom there's a little sometimes a
little strip that pops up will earn the
person who created the video money now
one thing that is true about this is
that you do not earn any money until you
get to $100 worth of profit once you get
$100 then they send you a check
supposedly I have not yet gotten my $100
I've been on YouTube for what seven
months I've been working toward you know
building my subscriber base and making
videos and all that and I have made a
total of thirty dollars something like
that from all of my videos and an
interesting way to kind of see how much
the youtubers that you're watching or
making is what you do is you you look at
like let's say they they made but I have
like 26 thousand views
if you cover up the last three zeros you
can see about how much money people have
made so according to that algorithm I
have made about twenty six dollars I've
made a few dollars more than that at
this point because one of my videos was
posted on somebody's blog somewhere and
it got me about a thousand views on that
video so and for whatever reason I think
it might be monetized higher if it's on
a blog or something like that I think
that's why a lot of youtubers make blogs
because I think that if you click on a
link from up long you make more money
off of it I think I don't know that for
sure but I've seem to be making more
money off of the Michael Todd anti-aging
video that I make off
anything else that means that if a video
gets a million views that person made
about a thousand dollars off of that
video if things keep flowing that way
and from the research that I'm done that
seems to be pretty true so like for
example there's a guy named sxephil that
I have met a couple of times at YouTube
gatherings back in the day he has over a
billion views and that means he's made
over a million dollars on YouTube
according to the algorithm now I haven't
talked to Phil in quite a few years so I
don't feel comfortable and and also do
not have the channels in order to
contact him and ask him how much money
have you made this year Phil but but
according to the algorithm EES made over
a million dollars on YouTube
jenna Marbles same thing over a million
dollars on YouTube I think that that's
really what they're making genuinely if
you look at a lot of the beauty gurus
you can see if they've got 28,000 views
on a video that may save me 28 dollars
off of one video um and I think that's
why there are a lot more beauty gurus
popping up because they see people
making all this money and they want a
piece of that now that being said did I
get on YouTube to make money absolutely
not when I first started making videos
back in 2006 cuz I did have a channel
from 2006 to 2009 that was really active
no one could monetize videos they didn't
start monetizing videos I think until
like 2008 and then only there were only
maybe 20 people that they allowed to
monetize that they allowed to be
partners
you couldn't just sign up for an account
to be a partner until like I think it
was like 2009 um so I didn't get into
this to make money and I'm still not
into this to make money would it be nice
to make money absolutely it'd be nice to
make money it would be nice to make
money to pay for some of the giveaways
that I do because as I'm now all the
lighting that I use my background all
the makeup that I've bought as gifts and
giveaways we're all with my own money it
would be nice to make enough money in
order to buy those things at least to
make a little extra rupee even better
you know but that's not why I got into
making videos I love making videos I
love talking to the camera I love
talking to you I loved
talking to people in the comments and
getting to know people on a personal
level another point I wanted to touch on
just as while I'm here vlogging vlogging
is a little bit about being a beauty
guru on YouTube
there is a youtuber that I watch a lot
her name is Vanessa she should put up a
video about the beauty community and how
it sucks and how you know it's so
cutthroat and everybody's so mean to
each other and and all this stuff and
you know people really from what I've
seen are not very into communicating and
the people that have more than let's say
15,000 subscribers for the most part
I've had a few that are willing to talk
to me but for the most part aren't
willing to talk to you like if you send
them a message through YouTube if you
said put a message on Facebook like they
don't respond like ever and I don't
really get that I did have one person
respond to me I emailed her and she
pretty much told me that what I should
do in order to get into a giveaway was
find people that were on my level and I
know she didn't mean anything by it but
I took that kind of as an insult to find
people on my level because that kind of
made me think well are you on a higher
level than me is this a video game or do
you think you're better than me like
which one is it it kind of irritated me
um because I don't see people to have
more subscribers as being better than me
you know just because you you've been on
it longer because more people have found
you doesn't make you better and this
person is a very very nice person if she
happens to watch this which I seriously
doubt she will I I wasn't mad at her I
was just a little irritated so so that
being said I don't really care about
anybody else other than the people I've
connected with as far as their opinion
of me about you know them getting me
subscribers or them talking about me on
my on their channel whoever I don't I
don't care about all of that I just you
know if I just kept you guys that are
watching this right now and that was as
far as I took my channel I'd be happy
with that because I really like that
people I'm talking to the people I'm
meeting on YouTube I really like you
guys and that's enough for me I don't
need
more than that if I don't make a set on
YouTube I don't need that
that's not why I got into this I didn't
get into this to become a beauty guru
and speaking of that do you know where
beauty guru came from it came from when
we used to be able to categorize our
channel and I was categorized as a
vlogger that's the way I hire eyes
myself but beauty beauty beauty videos
didn't really fit anywhere except for
the category of guru and it guru was
kind of a joke category at first like
nobody really knew what to do with guru
but then people in the beauty community
got attached to it and everybody became
a beauty guru and it just it still it
still makes me laugh because the name
guru just makes me think of like a
shaman you know something like that it
doesn't it doesn't click for me beauty
guru but anyway so that's kind of my
give and take on the beauty community
and making money on YouTube I'm not sure
if you found that interesting or not but
if you did great if you didn't I
apologize for wasting moments of your
day watch another one of my videos
you'll probably like it better because
this was way off of what I normally do
but um but yeah I just want to throw
that out there and just talk to you for
a bit about that any thoughts that you
have I would love to hear about it in
the comments below and Matt love to you
thank you for watching and I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
