the K where we test out Korean beauty
products to decide whether they're worth
your time and money today we are going
to be testing out and a potential dupe
for the Too Faced Born This Way and it
is called the aerosol aerodrome aritaum
Arizona I think I got it original it's
the aerodrome full coverage BB cream
this one is well-loved on reddit so
we're going to see whether we love it or
not this was recommended in the comments
section of one of my previous what the K
videos so I am very excited to test it
for you today I did test this one last
week but during this part of the video
my battery slipped out of my microphone
and it was no sound for most of it so
I'm redoing it today before we get going
let me tell you a little bit about the
specs about this product so I paid for
it on Amazon 1199 plus free shipping
with Amazon Prime you can also get this
off their website for 1266 plus eleven
dollars and 43 cents shipping from Korea
twenty four dollars and eight cents it
is delivered by DHL I was watching a
video on this by someone named Joan Kim
yes Joan Kim I couldn't read my own
handwriting she says is that this brand
is kind of like the Sephora of Korea
so four great things and I'm excited
about it one thing that is not so
exciting is it only comes in two shades
that is the same as a lot of Korean
foundation flash BB cream types of
products it comes in light beige and
natural beige I have the natural beige
which is number two and you'll see that
it's quite light I couldn't find
ingredients for this except for on cost
DNA and that's a place where people hand
type and the ingredients for products so
I'm trusting that whoever typed the
ingredients in type them in correctly
because I couldn't find an efficient
source with official ingredients let's
talk a little bit about them the first
ingredient is water second is cytanium
dioxide which is a sun protection
ingredient it does have
PS 50 plus PA plus plus plus and then it
says what nning and anti-wrinkle we're
going to get to that in a second
at the hexyl meso cinemate is also UV
protection and then glycerin Cloris
glycerin is a humectant so its goal is
to grab the humidity out of the air and
pull it into your skin if you don't have
enough humidity in the air it actually
can pull the humidity up one of the
humidity but the moisture humidity in
your skin you know this the moisture
from the bottom layers of your skin up
to the top and actually cause more
drying so glycerin can be good but there
are some things that people say aren't
so good about glycerin and it is the
third ingredient in this product zinc
oxide is another sunscreen active
ingredient and then a butylene glycol
which is for texture and skin
conditioning and then we get to
niacinamide the job of niacinamide is to
repress the production of melanin in the
skin doesn't completely repress it it's
not going to whiten your skin like to
make you really really white but if you
have discoloration hyperpigmentation
things like that nice and white is
supposed to help it so this isn't a skin
whitening ingredient that topically
bleaches the skin like some
controversial products do it's more of
from the inside out suppressing the
melanin production some other claims for
niacinamide are that it can help the
skin from further using damage it can
improve the appearance appearance of
enlarged pores uneven skin tone fine
lines dullness and weakened skin surface
and we have cetyl as the Hexen no
weights which can help your skin look
less dry and then some things in here
that you also might want to take note of
our beeswax so it's not vegan fragrance
at the hexyl palmitate so people that
don't like palm oil are not going to
like it
and phenoxyethanol there are no parabens
in this product let's go ahead and apply
this product I'm going to do half my
face with this one and then have to face
with the Too Faced I'm not going to use
a primer today because I found that if I
use the wrong primer with foundation on
me it's the foundation of the primer
don't match it can mess with the wear
time of the foundation because I don't
know what primer works best with this
I'm just going to use no primer at all I
don't really have the same problem with
setting powder so we are going to be you
and setting powder today for directions
they say for firm skin with adhesion so
I guess maybe to get it to stick to your
face better you're supposed to spread it
evenly with the hands for natural skin
that shines use a puff and Pat lightly
or for flawlessly smooth skin use a
brush and apply evenly we're going to go
ahead and use a brush there is quite a
bit of tone difference between these two
products I'll show you real quick so
this is the re doom and this is the Too
Faced you can see they are quite
different shades we're just going to go
for it because this is the closest I
have to a shade match in the Too Faced
Born This Way Foundation I'm going to
try to use the exact same amount so
about a pea-sized amount and this is the
new brush from royal and langnickel from
their Moda line and I love these kinds
of brushes these are what do you call
them like the RT style brushes but these
are very very affordable this was sent
to me by royal and langnickel / modo so
just so you know what scents me but I
just happened to really love this brush
brand which is probably why they keep
sending me stuff because they know how
much I was given that I'll keep talking
about it alright so let's go ahead and
see the coverage between the sides so
this is the one side of the Aria dome
and then this is with nothing let's do
one pump of the Born This Way again
about a pea-sized amount
I did put on my lips on purpose so you
could see the coverage over top of
redness you can see the tip a size
definitely has more coverage with that
one pea-sized amount I am going to add a
second dose of the re Jim side because I
want to make sure that they match as far
as coverage and you know we'll just make
a mental note that I did need more
product to build it up so now we're at
about medium coverage on both sides it
is kind of nice to be able to build it
up instead of going straight to more
opacity but I feel like with the
toothpaste I can put on less and have
less opacity this just I guess it just
needs a second coat here but keep that
in mind because you're going to run
through this twice as fast if you're
going for that coverage so will that be
make it more competitive as far as price
and you have to use twice as much of the
product you know what I mean
I also notice that this side of my face
is quite a bit shinier the origin side
is more shinier than this side all right
I'm going to go ahead and do the rest of
my face I am NOT going to put on
concealer shade because I want what's
happening under my eyes to just be
foundation so I'm going to go do my full
face and I'll be right back
rest of my face is done I use the Laura
Mercier setting powder I use some NYX
blushes I use contour from the tort
claim allit highlight is from this this
is who is she cosmetics glamor empire
more hashtag more love left hate it just
I felt like this was an appropriate
palette for right now so this is what I
used on my eyes as well I used the shade
and the shade on my eyes this shade on
my cheeks I'm still playing with this
verdicts still out as far as how much I
like this right now I'm just kind of
feeling it's just okay but I did want to
play with it more and it was calling to
me today so I used it I also use a
little bit of the Juvia space - Heron
palette as well on my eyes and then lips
are M cosmetics this is the shade Rose
nude very very similar in formula to the
bare minerals gen you'd liquid lipsticks
pretty much almost identical formulas
there if you're interested in these I do
really like
them a lot it is almost 3 o'clock it is
255 in the afternoon I had quite a
morning and just didn't feel like
filming yet so I was waiting till I had
my energy back to film we're going to be
doing an 8 hour wear test so I will
check in with you again at 11 o'clock
tonight alright my friend see you in a
second it will be many many hours for me
that was really fast wasn't it for you
at least it has been an entire day for
me it is 11 o'clock at night my entire
family is sleeping except for me and I
am about to join them but before I do I
wanted to show you how to use a
foundation / BB cream work today so if
you remember this was on this side this
was on this side and I feel like they
were about the same I feel like I've got
about the same amount of product from
both products on either side let's go
ahead and zoom in really quickly so you
can see the coverage that I still have
so let's look at this side
excuse the glasses mark says wear my
glasses all day I was outside with my
kids at the park for about an hour we
ran some errands we went out to grab
some sushi came back relaxed at the
house so it wasn't a super stressful day
but I was sweating a little bit at the
park you can see that on both sides
I have Breaking Away around my nose it's
completely gone off the center but I
don't really I don't really count that
because the way I applied it I kind of
went like this toward the center so I'm
not really concerned about like the top
of my nose just because of my
application technique for today but this
right here on this side and then again
on this side I don't like I also don't
like that my chin is also breaking up if
you look at my forehead I have more
wrinkles on this side than I have this
side but but the foundation / BB cream
has is seeping into my wrinkles on both
sides so that's something that I don't
particularly like either they basically
to meet the sides look like they met
I don't see any difference at all it's
good don't get me wrong it's good but is
it magical is it revolutionary no is it
just as good as the born this way yes it
is but I feel like I had to use twice as
much of this one as I did of the born
this way mmm you get the same kind of
coverage so I'm going to run through
this twice as fast making it twice as
expensive if you think of it that way if
I'm planning on repurchasing if I go
through it twice a set actually let's
look at the ounces this is 50
milliliters and this is oh wait just a
moment this is 50 milliliters and this
is 30 milliliters so even if I go
through this twice as fast
I have almost twice as much product in
here so that makes a really big
difference if I can figure out some math
I'll put it right here or as what the
world that means in dollar amount yeah
so that just made a big difference
looking at the milliliters I assume they
have the same amount they don't well
that makes things a little bit different
I do think that this is good if the the
niacinamide freaks you out though then
that might be something you want to
consider or if you do have discoloration
in your skin of dark spots melasma
something like that and maybe you do
want to consider this because it might
help even out your skin tone I will put
some links about niacinamide down below
in case you're curious and want to read
more about the ingredients will I
continue to use this BB cream yes I am
going to continue to use it I do enjoy
it I would probably purchase it over the
Born This Way and I do really like the
Born This Way I don't remember my Born
This Way breaking up on me this bed in
the bed so I don't know if it was just
because of thick - going to the park and
being out in the weather maybe that main
effect on it what I don't usually wear
this one out is much because this is my
filming foundation I'm conflicted
I am truly conflicted about how I feel
because it did work just as good as this
and I really like this but yet it's
breaking up on my face and it's like I
feel like my Born This Way is betraying
me right now
I would love to know your experience
with either one of these products down
below I'm kind of torn I'm going to have
to give it a heart rating but I'm still
kind of torn and I'm not sure I feel
secure in the heart rating you're seeing
right now I'm not sure I feel secure in
that but I'm going to keep using this
but hopefully I gave you enough
information that you know whether you
want to try this product or not oh I
thank you so much for watching what the
K this week I hope you enjoyed it if you
did definitely make sure you hit the
subscribe button hit the thumbs up
button cuz it makes me look super cool
next week we are going to be testing out
something very easy much easier than a
wear test but it looks like a lot of fun
this is the Tony moly banana and milk
and it's called magic food banana and it
looks like this and it's even got a
little sticker on there to make it look
like a banana and it just look like fun
we're talk about whether there's true
hydrating ingredients in this or whether
it's just things that make your hands
feel good for the moment but don't
actually do anything that's the big
thing I want to explore with this so I
again thank you so much for watching and
mad love to you and I will see you in a
video soon but away with my banana bye
bye from me in my banana</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
