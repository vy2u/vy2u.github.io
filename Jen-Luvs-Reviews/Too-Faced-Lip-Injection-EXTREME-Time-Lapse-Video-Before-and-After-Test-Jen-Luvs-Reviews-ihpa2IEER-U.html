review of v2 faze lip injection extreme
this is the kind of video I've never
done before because I haven't ever had a
product that I think this would fit with
but I think this is going to be a lot of
fun let me give you a very fast
backstory so I got this in an emcee bag
I put it on my lips my lips are on fire
it was very weird but in a strange way I
kind of enjoyed it I don't know it's
very very odd so what I did was I was
doing my anti haul on my live chat if
you've never been to one of my live
chats they're super fun I'll leave more
information about the live chat down in
the description because I don't want to
go into too much about that right now so
I put it on in the live chat and I was
talking about my experience with it and
as I was talking about it people were
saying your lips are getting bigger they
are getting more plump and I'm like
really it's actually working so what I
figured I would do is I would do a real
time well sped up real-time review of
this so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to remove my lip product and I am
going to leave this on my lips for five
minutes I'm going to speed up the
footage to see if we can actually see my
lips plumping I thought that would be a
lot of fun then I'm going to take the
footage downstairs I'm going to look at
it and then I'll tell you what I
personally think about what I saw so
let's go ahead and remove a lip product
and get started alright I just put a
physical exfoliant on my lips so that I
could kind of get off some of the root
on my lips how many of you just a quick
look at my lips my lips are not small
but they are not ginormous mm-hmm I
never really thought about that I needed
a lip plumper but it'll still be fun to
see if it works or not okay so now I'm
going to set my timer for five minutes
and I'm going to try to stay as still as
possible for these five minutes so you
can see it working
all right starting to tingle and I'm
setting the five-minute timer now
all right so it has now been on for five
minutes so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go down and look at the footage
for this and then we'll come back and
we'll talk about how much it costs
ingredients why it tingles why it may be
working or not working so wasn't you on
one second which for me we'll probably
about 10-15 minutes all right so I just
went down and I checked the footage and
what I did was I took an image I took a
screen capture of my lips right after I
put it on and then I took a screen
capture of my lips after the five
minutes and I laid them on top of each
other and there is a difference between
when I first put it on and after I'm not
sure
you
I know if you can tell a difference
between this point in the video and
earlier in the video but there is a
slight difference in the size of my lips
which is very exciting actually let's
talk about why we think this happened
okay so I looked up the ingredients and
thankfully there are not very many bad
ingredients in this according to
environmental working group that's where
I get a lot of my information on the
chemicals found in makeup I will link
their website down below there's two
oils in here that can cause acne it
being on the lips I don't know how much
that's going to make a difference for
you but it does have avocado oil and
jojoba oil and those are acting causing
so I don't know I don't know how
sensitive your skin is to acne but just
so you know those are in there also we
have an ingredient that's like a vitamin
E it's called Toco Toco Farrell acetate
there we go I think I got it there are
contamination concerns for that I'm also
it can be a skin toxin on there is an
allergen risk for this so you could
actually be allergic to it if you're
sensitive to this tocopherol acetate the
last thing you may be sensitive to is it
does have a paraben in it there is
strong evidence that it can be an
allergen for some people so just be
aware if you are know you're sensitive
to parabens you definitely do not want
to mess with this product so why do we
think this is actually working well in
my opinion I think that it's an
ingredient called capsicum fruit just
since I don't know resin okay basically
all that is is it is an extract from hot
peppers it doesn't what it is they take
it they take the the thing that makes
your lips burn when you eat a hot pepper
what makes your skin tingle when you eat
a hot pepper and they throw it in the
lip injection and that's why it tingles
the way that it does and that's why some
people find it incredibly uncomfortable
is because you're actually putting hot
pepper juice on your lips but does it
work technically yeah it definitely
works as you can see through the five
minutes my pain level was going up and
then it went down right now I can barely
feel that it's on my lips anymore it's
really just a couple of minutes where it
is quite uncomfortable but then it goes
away but you have to be able to tolerate
that pain or else you're not going to
enjoy this product this is a $28 product
it includes four grams of product and
that means that it's $7 per gram
this is the one that I'm using a deluxe
sample size so keep that in mind that
this is not a full-size this one's 1.5
grams of product so it's a little more
than a quarter of a full size of
products you're going to get a lot more
if you get a full-size so there's so a
couple of questions in my mind about
this the first one being are my lips
going to continue to plump for a longer
period of time the second one is how
long these effects going to last is this
something I'm going to need to reapply
in order to keep the effects I want to
thank you so much for watching the video
