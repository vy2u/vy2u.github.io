the new to face sugar pop eyeshadow
palette you may notice something a
little bit different about me I got my
hair did I was gonna do like a dark with
like an ombre like bright red at the
bottom but we did have enough time i'm
going i'm at i know in real time it's
after I mad but I'm going to I match
tomorrow in real time so want to get my
herded so we ended up going pretty black
but I really really like it so enough
about my hair and on to the sugar pop
eyeshadow palette before we get into
tutorial i just want to show you some
swatches now one thing I learned about
doing the drugstore videos I know I'm
doing this for like two years but
sometimes it just takes me a while to
learn things I did the swatches of the
drugstore palettes and then when I
actually use them they didn't look
anything like the swatches so I'm gonna
swatch these for you but I'm going to
only do brush swatches instead of finger
swatches and I think that's really going
to help you to see how they apply to the
eye so let's go ahead and get into this
watching that's got all close and
personal up in here so we're going to
start with rock candy now these three
don't show up really well on my skin
tone so I'm just warning you ahead of
time they don't show up real well but I
think that they would show it much
better on a deeper skin tone there's
that and you can see you can't even
really see the sparkles in it at all
okay now we're going to go into
strawberry ice here
next up is peach fuzz these have a very
small amount of subtle glitter in them
but they are so subtle and there's no
fallout in them they're just barely
there just enough to give you a little
pizzazz without making you look like
you're trying to be 15 you know or if
you're 15 you can look 15 but you're not
15 you don't want to look 15 these are
good shadows all right so you can see
they're not really showing up on my hand
very well but what makes that nice on my
skin tone is they're really really nice
blending colors and as you'll see in the
tutorial in a minute you'll see how it
kind of shows up on my lid a little bit
better than it's showing up in the
swatches all right so let's move on to
the fun ones here is macaroon this is
the one that I used on the outer corner
of my eye lid it's got some subtle bold
glitters in it all right another one of
my favorite shades in here is malted
milk ball
so that makes for a beautiful transition
color or you can deepen it up in your
crease like I'm going to do and cut the
crease with it and it's really really
pretty that way as well because it
builds nicely moving on to sugared
violet there and this one is called
blackberry very appropriately named you
can see how smoothly that went on just
so smooth like butta this pink here is
called bubble gum and I've done my eye
look that I'm wearing today with bubble
gum and it turned out great and then
finally we have blue raspberry down here
so there's all the shades all together
this is rock candy strawberry ice peach
fuzz macaroon malted milk ball sugared
violet blackberry bubblegum and blue
raspberry and I just feel funny not
doing finger swatches so I'm just going
to do some finger swatches real quick
I'm going to swatch these above and
below the brush watches just so you can
see the difference so those are the
finger swatches of rock candy strawberry
ice and peach fuzz hi and then we're
going to go on the side of my hand I
know that's so not pro but it is what it
is macaroon malted milk balls sugared
violet and you can see how the finger
swatch has become so much more pigmented
so imagine that this would be more of
like how you would apply it wet with a
brush or if you applied it over top of
like oh oh Nix I crayon and milk
something like that would make these
colors pop like that blackberry
bubblegum blue raspberry biome so can
you see them all maybe kind of sort of
know I got a lot of compliments on my
eyeshadow look that I wore for what's up
the makeup which is my makeup news show
that I do every Sunday I got a lot of
compliments on that eyeshadow look so I
decided that I was going to show you a
little look that I created with this
palette so I put my makeup on again like
I did for that video so I'm going to go
ahead and show you that I look and then
we'll go ahead and get into the review
alright so here we go getting ready to
put on the eyeshadow and there is the
beautiful sugar pop palette and it's in
that hard tin which is really really
nice for travel and there are the
gorgeous shades now right above those
shades you will notice that there is a
pamphlet and when you remove that
pamphlet there is a smaller mirror
inside which is still very nice to have
and then this is the palette that
pamphlet itself and it's sealed with a
sticker but when you undo the sticker
there's actually three I looks
underneath some different suggestions
they have ones that look a little more
realistic on the one side to kind of
show you what it's supposed to look like
on your eyes see they get a look
Roy and then on the other side it shows
you a diagram with directions for how to
apply each I look now I'm going to go
ahead and I'm going to apply my Mac
Paint Pot in painterly on my eyelids for
a couple of purposes one is to make my
eyeshadows stick one is to make them
last a bit longer and the most important
one for me at least is to mute out that
dark color on my eyelids my natural
darkness and I feel like it just gives
me a really nice just kind of a clean
base to start with and we're going to go
ahead and start right ahead with that
macaroon color which is that bright
orange coralie kind of color I guess is
coral orange I don't know but I'm going
to kind of you see I'm patting that on
on the outer half of my eyelid I'm not
rubbing it I'm patting it on which
really increases the pigmentation now
I'm going to wipe off that brush because
that's going to be very important in the
next step and we're going to go in with
peach fuzz which is very close to my
natural skin tone it's just got a little
tiny bit of subtle sparkle in it and I'm
patting that on as well crossing over
into that macaroon shade just a little
bit so that I can get a nice transition
in a minute now i'm going to go ahead up
into the rock candy color and i'm going
to highlight my inner corner of my eye
to kind of give my eyes that nice little
pop
all right now it's time to deepen up
that crease this is a coastal scents
crease brush and we're going to go in
with malted milk ball in the crease and
we're gonna windshield wiper motion up
into the crease and you notice I'm not
going all the way over into my inner
corner and the reason why I don't is
because I feel like that looks really
weird so that's just a personal opinion
I just don't like the way that looks on
my eye so I go about three-fourths of
the way in and I can't try to
concentrate the color on that outer
corner and then blend it in word and
you'll see that the same way on the
other eye I'm kind of circling it around
in that outer corner and then bringing
it into the crease giving the least
amount of color into the inner corner if
any at all kind of middle and we'll stay
roots and we're just going to blend out
that color just a little bit we're going
to keep blending it but we're going to
blend it out just a little bit on that
brow bone just to make sure there's no
harsh lines but we'll go back in with a
brow bone color in a minute now this is
the wayne goss number 20 brush you don't
need this to cut the crease you can use
any kind of pencil brush you know that a
lot of them will work very very well
Real Techniques makes a really nice one
as well and just kind of windshield my
way promotions again back and forth but
this is just to really define the crease
you get that stark contrast between the
light lid color and the deep crease
color which is really really popular
right now I'm also kind of feathering it
out in the corner almost giving it a
slight wing to look but not obnoxious
wing look just a little bit just so you
know really open up the eye and give it
a nice to find look all right that's how
it's looking so far looking pretty good
looking pretty good and going back and
and brightening up the lid with exactly
what I had done before I'm just using
that macaroon again on that outer half
of my eye patting it in on each side
just to brighten it up
now this is I think is really important
going in with this Real Techniques brush
I think really helps a lot because it's
a super dense brush which makes it very
good for blending so I'm again I'm
crossing over that macaroon color but
I'm really focusing on the blending
making sure that those two shades the
macaroon and the peach fuzz are blended
beautifully together now I didn't show
the shade here but that's the rock candy
going again into my inner corner there's
the rock candy I'm going to bring that
up now onto my brow bone to brighten up
the brow bone and make that area of my
face pop but also to blend out the
malted milk ball and just make sure
there's no harsh lines and that's how I
look is looking so far without anything
else on there and then off-camera I
applied my eyeliner and my mascara and
that is the Jessie's Girl liquid
eyeliner that I love and also the
benefits a roller lash in three coats
and now I'm trying to look all cute
before I give you my full review so
overall what I recommend this palette
absolutely i love this palette it is so
awesome one of the reasons why i really
really like this is i do like the subtle
shimmer in it because it's not like
super young i'm trying to be a kid
shimmer it's like mature shimmer you
know what I'm saying nice shimmer but
it's got like glittery sparkle in it but
it's not obnoxious it's very very subtle
especially been placed on the eye I love
how easy this is to use because you've
got at least for my skin tone about my
lid colors here I've got my crease color
here and then this is my outer like half
colors in here I've used blackberry up
in the crease instead of malted milk
ball and that looks really really pretty
as well but it is super pigmented so it
takes a little bit of time to blend out
blackberry it's not quite as easy to
work with the ads malted milk ball but
it's really really nice but overall I
mean such a fun palette to play with
really really enjoying it a lot if
you've got a couple bucks to take around
