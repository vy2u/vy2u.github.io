the Too Faced natural love palette I
have so much information to give you
about this palette I cannot wait to
share it with you alright especially
this video if you have never seen my
review videos before they're very long I
have so much information for you please
use the skip ahead buttons down below if
you find that you're kind of zoning out
during a section which you're not
interested take a minute just click in
the description you'll be able to find
the time stamp of the next section just
skip ahead because there's so much good
information in every section is quite
different so even if you're not enjoying
one section you'll probably enjoy the
next section so just wanted to let you
know lots of information happening in
this video but we're going to go in the
typical order that I normally do
starting with how is this made and where
can you get it
so the first thing is how is this made
so in this product cruelty free to face
does say that they are a cruelty free
brand but they are owned by Estee Lauder
who is not cruelty free so depending on
what you believe to be cruelty free you
may consider to face a cruelty free
brand you may not this is not a vegan
palette it has carmine in it carmine is
made from crushed needles and the
following shades do have carmine in them
nudee laced heady satin sheets push up
undercover kittens bunny knows love bub
poodle cutie patootie dear diary
honeymoon and makeup and chill all have
carmine in them so that is a lot of the
palettes of your nan fan of carmine you
do not want to purchase this palette the
box says it is bulk made in the United
States but it is assembled in the
Dominican Republic it is distributed
from Irvine California in the United
States you can participant at Too Faced
calm or at Ulta Sephora or Macy's and at
all of those retailers it is $59 now
let's go into the packaging a little bit
so it is a cardboard packaging with a
magnetic closure it is a typical
cardboard until you get to this funny
stuff on here and this funny stuff can
collect some dirt just like the Anasazi
of modern renaissance color of the it
cosmetics palettes got these really cute
little animals on here this little bunny
who is not fuzzy you've got some birds
and some roses or some kind of flower
they're very very pretty if you open it
up
your 30 eyeshadows in there you'll also
see that you have a very large sized
mirror this does not say open in any way
so if you want to use the mirror you're
going to have to either hold the palette
up or you're gonna have to prop the
mirror against something the way that I
choose to use it is I use a different
mirror and then I just hold the palette
like this but I can see over time doing
this over and over again may weaken the
cardboard here and may lead to tearing
in the future right now no signs of that
but that's a possibility so like I
mentioned there are 30 shades in the
palette there 0.8 grams each which are
quite small they're about half size to
like a Mac Shadow there are 24 grams
total in the palette leading up to 2
dollars and 46 cents per gram which is
pretty typical for a two-faced palette
it's actually quite inexpensive when
comparing to like urban decay or honest
Asya brands like that even lorac is
quite inexpensive compared to those it's
one of the least expensive program that
you'll find at Sephora so now that you
have all those details let's go ahead
and go into the swatches I've been
getting it seems like no matter what I
do with the swatches I get critiques for
how I do it the brush that I use whether
I wet it or not things like that so I
just want to preface this by saying you
can swatch eyeshadows in so many
different ways with so many different
brushes with wet with dry over primer
not over primer
I can't include all of that in the
videos so if you purchase this you're
going to have to play with it and find
out what works best for you these are
just examples swatches over dry skin no
primer I'm going to use my current
favorite brush which is the omnia brush
by royal and langnickel that we dive in
boxycharm I absolutely love this brush
would there be other brushes that might
show off some of these swatches better
probably but I can't just keep switching
brushes for each eyeshadow and a lot of
people don't have many different kinds
of brushes to use so you just got to
kind of take them with a grain of salt
and know that they'll show up
differently depending on the techniques
that you use also keeping in mind that I
am swatching downward if you pat them
you're going to get a different effect I
did try to I'm going to show you right
now I did try to wet the brush at one
point and I put it into two eyeshadows
and I decided to stop that behavior
because I actually damaged both of the
eyeshadows that I put it in I know
you're not really supposed to wet
brushes for a matte shadow but I was
trying to do something different I'm
trying to make people happy so I will
not be doing that for this palette or in
the future unless a palette specifically
says it can be used wet I'm not going to
do that anymore so without me never have
done any more here are all the swatches
ladies and gentleman alright my friends
welcome to these swatches of the natural
live palette so I like to swatch a not
quad so it was really difficult to
swatch this palette so what I did is I
just did the first four going across
these are heaven fairytale nudie and
tickle me and as you'll be able to see
with the brush swatch it picked up
beautifully on the brush but then once
watched on the arm kind of comes off a
little bit weak compared to some of the
other shadows that I have I'm currently
testing the dose of colors eyeshadow
palette and the right shade on there is
so incredibly opaque and a brush swatch
it's insane I wish that two-face could
do something like that as you can see
fairytale and tickle me are very
glittery especially especially Fairy
Tail
beautiful beautiful shade now with the
white test like most light shades they
do all pretty much come off except for
nudie going into the second row the
first four shades in the second row
again we're going with the light to
mid-tone shades and we're having me
pretty much exact same experience that
we did with the first row in that the
really light shades really don't brush
swatch very well they do apply to the
eye much better than they do in the
swatch but I do wish they had a little
more opacity to them I like to push up a
lot it's a nice shimmery shade and honey
pots on my shade these are repeat shades
from other palettes but they are
beautiful and I can see why they repeat
them in so many different palettes I
forgot to do well white tests on that
row sorry about that now onto the third
row for from the light to mid shades
these are kind of the pinky or shades
and this crow is really really beautiful
I don't feel like the swatches truly do
these shades justice especially kittens
and bunny knows I mean they're just
really pretty shades and I honestly
don't own anything like them also
moonbeam is also a really gorgeous
shimmery
it's not a super poppy shimmer like a
foiled shadow but it is really really
pretty especially if you tap it on the
lids with a fingertip it's beautiful
so now with the white test same thing
happens with this one this one's
actually worse in that none of them
stuck around at all now we've got the
fourth row of the first four this is
poodle cutie patootie dear diary coffee
date this is another road that I really
really like a lot poodles probably the
weakest out of these shades but they're
really fun to play with they're very
nice for nice light natural looks again
not very poppy but they'll give you a
beautiful look when used together the
shimmer is just gorgeous on these I do
feel like these breasts watch a little
bit better than some of the other shades
the white tests on these you'll see that
they really do fade down completely or
just to kind of a muted Brown the last
row of four we have spotlight honey
butter honeymoon and hot and bothered
hot and bothered actually a really
really pretty shade I really like
honeymoon too
I just like the rest of that first
column of shadows they just really don't
brush swatch very well they're not my
favorite light shades ever made to face
that's not their strength at all trying
to figure out what Tuesday strength is
though which would be completely honest
with you I guess kind of those muted
shimmers that aren't like super foils
this is the row all together you can see
hot and bothered is the only one that's
super bright and then when you wipe them
away again hot and bothered is the only
one that sticks around now these are the
deepest shades in the palette we're
going to go downward through that column
and this is don't settle chocolate
martini lovebug and spoiled
and brush swatch on don't settle is
pretty sink and terrible so I went back
in for another swatch sometimes it's
nice to have a buildable shadow that
doesn't go on super opaque and then with
the second swatch it does better I mean
it's really up to your personal
preference what you like
as you can see brush watched on these
there really isn't a ton of variation in
tone so I'm actually really thankful
that the swatches ended up having to
come out like this so you can really see
that there isn't a lot of difference
between these shades and on the eye you
can barely tell the difference between
them I feel like a Love Bug is the one
that's the most different but even that
one is really not that much different
than the others and with the white test
don't settle is completely gone where
chocolate martini I feel like laughs the
best and the rest just kind of gray out
going down the last column fingers
crossed under cover smokin and night
fever again not a lot of variation in
this column but I think that it's better
than the column before again I have to
dip in for fingers crossed a second time
but this makes the palette a little bit
easier to work with that it is buildable
under covers probably my favorite out of
these here smoking is pretty stinking
bad even used on the eye smoking is not
a very pigmented shade I don't really
like that one much I do like Night Fever
however Night Fever is a great shade for
deepening out the outer corner for me
but as you can see there really isn't a
lot of variation there now with the
white test these all hang out there
really really well sorry for the
blurriness there but when you blend them
out they really do look very very
similar the very last two shades i'm
swatching for you our makeup and chill
and stiletto and makeup and chill is a
very nice shade this was from the
nikkietutorials talent I do really like
working this with this one a lot it
brush swatches pretty well stiletto is
definitely not the blackest black you'll
ever see but for a more natural look I
feel like it's appropriate to have this
in the palette because it's not going to
give you something that people that want
a natural look don't want
and for the white test definitely
sticking around hanging around there so
if you're not going to have to worry
about over blending these and having
them disappear okay now you've seen all
of this swatches let's go into
ingredient analysis the reason why I do
this is because a lot of people are
sensitive to certain ingredient or don't
like certain ingredients in their
products you don't like the section feel
free to skip on by I've gotten a lot of
critiques lately so I'm a little
sensitive but let's go into the
ingredients the first thing is that some
of these shadows are definitely not lips
safe they include dyes such as
ultramarine ferric ferrocyanide or
aluminum powder which the FDA says you
should not be putting on your lips so
these shades are definitely not lips
safe nudee lace Teddy satin sheets
push-up kittens
dear diary honeymoon hot and bothered
and makeup and chilled do not put those
on your lips the FDA says it is not safe
also every single one of these shadows
has an ingredient called
at the hexyl palmitate which is a
derivative of palm oil and finding out
more and more of the people that watch
my videos do not buy palm oil for
environmental reasons this is a
derivative of palm oil it's in every
single one of the eyeshadows so if you
do not like to purchase things with palm
oil you do not want to purchase this
eyeshadow College also at the hexyl
palmitate can also be an irritant to
some people this eyeshadow palette also
includes calc which is the irritant to
some people and phenoxyethanol which is
conservative that is also an irritant to
some people we mentioned the carmine
earlier also I know that there is at
least one person that watches my videos
that cannot have cornstarch in her
eyeshadows I just want to let you know
the shade honeypot does have cornstarch
none of the rest do so for you
girlfriend just so you know don't use
honeypot if you buy this eyeshadow
palette other than that that's it for
the ingredients everything else is
pretty standard pretty typical nothing
else you really need to know as far as
my research goes so let's go ahead and
get into the demo of how I got this look
today again let me preface by saying I
am NOT a makeup artist I never claimed
to be a makeup artist I am a makeup
enthusiast this is the way I chose to
put on my eyeshadow it's just to give
you an idea how these shadows can be
applied to the eyes onto the demo of how
I got this look today so here is the
full palette
so first we're going to start with the
Too Faced shadow insurance I felt like
it was only fair to use their own eye
shadow primer with this I do feel like
it definitely works better with a primer
either this one of the urban decay will
work really well going up into the
crease with gnudi this is the perfect
transition shade for me it works very
very well I can see why they've included
it in so many palettes now we're going
to go into kittens this is my favorite
shade in the palette hopefully you can
see the the colors in it it actually is
a very complex shadow if I you do
buildable Nod there I really like it a
lot and lovebugs really complements this
shadow very very well but unfortunately
there isn't a whole lot of contrast
there so when I tried to build it up on
the outer corner it didn't really do a
whole lot I had to build and build and
build and build but eventually you
really can tell a difference between
those two shades owing into undercover I
wanted to deepen up the crease to give
the look a little bit more dimension and
I feel like it does pretty well doing
that and now I'm just blending this out
with a clean fluffy brush to kind of get
rid of that harsh line that I made this
is the shade poodle that I'm using in
the inner corner and if you look at the
swatches this one didn't swatch very
well but it goes much better on the eye
now I'm going to use heaven to blend out
the brow bone again works great for that
and I'm just going to use a q-tip with
some Bioderma you can use any my solar
water to or makeup remover to kind of
clean up that's just my choice I really
like Bioderma and just a point a q-tip
from Ulta those things are awesome just
kind of making sure that the line
doesn't go below my lash line so this is
the final look without liner and lashes
and I feel like it came out pretty good
for a natural neutral look this is not
complex it's not hard to do but I think
that that's what this is all about this
palette now my favorite part of my
review is my full review of the
eyeshadow palette so let's first talk
about B shade selection in here of
course this is called the natural love
palette it's got loss of natural looking
shade you're not going to get a poppy
instagram-worthy
look out of this unless you use
something like six-plus or water to wet
the shadows which I person
do not recommend doing just because of
my experience with these two shadows
there are only eight map shades in here
heaven lay steady nudie spotlight honey
butter and make up and chill and
stiletto those are your matte shades
that are in here everything else in here
is a version of satin shimmer glitter
Sparkle the only one that is that rough
like glittery texture that to say stuff
sometimes is Fairy Tail that one's got
that thick chunky glitter I didn't find
that to be the case with any of the
other ones but there are ones that
definitely have significant sparkle in
them as you may have heard in other
reviews there are quite a few repeat
shades in this palette but I want to say
something about that
I appreciate the two phases being honest
about what shades are repeats I have
found in the past like the
nikkietutorials talent that there was a
shade that was in the Christmas one of
the Christmas cows was also in the
nikkietutorials top that they remained
the shade I personally don't like that I
would much rather them say hey this is
the same shade you know what I'm saying
also I found that the jelly shade from
one from the peanut butter and jelly
palette was in another palette that was
renamed and I did not like that so I
appreciate that they have admitted that
half of this palette exactly half 15
shades were in other eye shadow palettes
and 15 that 15 of them I believe to be
brand new to this palette so you can see
in the photo there these right here are
the shades that are from other palettes
and then these are the ones that are
from this palette that are just
exclusive to this palette so in case you
own other to face eye shadow palettes I
did a little research for you so you'd
know which ones you may already own and
which ones will be new to you so the
natural eyes palette the shades heaven
nudie push-up honeypot and chocolate
martini are all in this palette the la
petit Maison which was the holiday 2015
palette have the shades don't settle and
honeypot in them that are also in here
in the natural matte palette you'll find
lace Teddy heaven new tea and honey
butter for boudoir eyes if I can say
that boudoir broodwar eyes has the shade
satin sheets naked eye has the shades
pink cheeks satin sheets and Salette oh
there was a palette called the Isle
pallette it was a Sephora beauty insider
exclusive that had the shades heaven
push-up and satin sheets the cat eyes
palette has a shade called kitten but
the one in here is called kittens and it
is a looks like it's the same shape but
kittens has shimmer and it's more of a
satin finish where kitten was a matte
sweet indulgences was a holiday 2012
eyeshadow palette that had satin sheets
and honeymoon but the honeymoon shade in
there is very very different than the
honeymoon in here whenever you see
honeymoon and another eyeshadow palette
it looks to be the same as in that
palette but this honeymoon is very
different from any other honeymoon
they've released before so maybe they
got remarried who knows the natural in
nights how it has the Night Fever shade
and also spotlight the everything nice
from holiday of 2014 has heaven honeypot
and don't settle and the nikkietutorials
power of makeup eyeshadow palette had
the shade makeup and chill and then
there was a duo called the poodle puff
duo that I believe has the shade poodle
in it it looks the same I don't own it I
think it's the same but I'm not a
hundred percent sure so hopefully that
was helpful to you to face collectors
out there so I've got two more things I
want to talk about the first one is
about the wear time of the palette and
the second one is about who is this
eyeshadow palette good board so for is a
wear time my friend Jessica from Jam
Beauty 89 did a review of this and she
had a heck of a time with wear time of
this eyeshadow palette and I have to
agree with Jessica on it I'm going to
kind of inch into who this is good for
as well if you're looking for just a
basic school or work look to get you
through an eight-hour day you probably
will find some fading by that six hour
eight hour mark you cannot carry this
eyeshadow palette into the evening in my
personal experience it's pretty much
completely gone by the end of the day
but like the four hour mark I still had
a pretty nice look going on it was just
that six hour mark 8 hour mark there was
significant fading so I do agree with
Jessica I don't think it's a dud palette
because of that though because I feel
like some people just don't care about
it lasting a really long time so it's up
to you how important that is to you as
you know I try to find positives because
I can't assume that your preference
the same as my preference Oh laughing
power is just okay for me on this so
that kind of leads us to who this is
good for so really and truly if you
already have a lot of neutral pellets
you really don't need this they're just
a couple of shades that I feel are
special this shade kittens I know
nothing like the shade I absolutely love
it it's gorgeous
it's probably one of my favorite
eyeshadow shades of all time as far as
the color I love this color it's just
beautiful I also really like bunny nose
and I really like the shade lovebug and
I really love the shade coffee date
randomly it seemed that it looks
ordinary but it really is beautiful on
the eye dear diary it's also a beautiful
shade cutie-patootie reminds me kind of
of the peach palette shades but it's
really really pretty you know five
shades in here I feel like are pretty
special the rest of it is kind of not
really very special so if you like let's
say your mom doesn't have a lot of
eyeshadows and you want to get her into
wearing eyeshadows you know she maybe
has an eight-hour job during the day you
want to get her something that's really
easy to work with where she can get a
lot of different looks and try a lot of
different things I would definitely
recommend this or if that's you and not
your mom I would definitely recommend
this but I mean if you if you have a
huge makeup collection if you like
really bright bold look this is
definitely not going to be for you it's
just not a very unique or interesting
palette overall but I can definitely see
some people really really loving this
palette it kind of reminds me of the
lorac mega Pro palette in that you get
so many shades there's so much
versatility in here I've noticed that
this is really really easy to use
because you can actually use these in
rows and it makes it really easy for a
beginner to use if you look at these
just straight across you can get
gorgeous looks out of these this was
very well thought out very well planned
you're not overloaded with super light
shades for people of a light skin tone
people the deeper skins one are going to
find lots of options you've got a nice
mix of lights mediums and deeps in here
it was so thought out and I feel like
two-face really put a lot of love into
this pallet and I haven't said that in a
very long time they're two-faced I felt
like put a lot of effort into a pallet I
feel like this was very carefully
crafted and ever put these shades in
here I do feel like did a fantastic job
but you have to accept it for what it is
which is a natural love pallet you're
not going to get your bold poppy looks
out of this I don't think it pretends to
be something that it's not and that
makes me very very happy so overall I am
going to give this a higher rating than
I have some other eyeshadow palettes and
the reason for that is that that it
doesn't pretend to be something that
it's not I do feel like this is similar
in quality for the shadows to the
chocolate bar palette and the bon bons
palette I do feel like those laughs just
a bit longer on the eye overall than
these but it's more similar to the
chocolate bar palette and the bon bons
palette than it is to the holiday
palettes if that makes sense
I want to thank you so much for watching
this video if you enjoyed it I hope you

possibly want to know about this
eyeshadow palette in this video if you
