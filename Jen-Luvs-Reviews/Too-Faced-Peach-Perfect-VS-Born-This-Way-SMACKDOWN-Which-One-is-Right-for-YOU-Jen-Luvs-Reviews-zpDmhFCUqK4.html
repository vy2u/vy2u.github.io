and comparison of the Too Faced Born
This Way and the Too Faced peach perfect
foundation what inspired this video is
that I went to the Too Faced YouTube
channel and I am subscribed to that
channel and I saw a video where they
were supposed to be explaining the
differences between these two
foundations and yeah they never said the
differences so what I decided to do was
to analyze both of these foundations and
break it down for you so if you're
curious about that I'm about to share it
with you right now if you've never been
to one of my review videos before they
are quite long so what I suggest you do
is there are skip ahead buttons down in
the description down below so you can
skip ahead to the next section you can
find out more information on a different
topic relating to these two foundations
let's go ahead and break it down so just
a couple of things about Too Faced as a
brand Too Faced as a brand is cruelty
free but their parent company Estee
Lauder is not cruelty free so depending
on your level of cruelty free Ness you
may say that they are or are not cruelty
free born this way is available at Too
Faced calm Sephora all T's mason Bowl
T's Born This Way is sold at Too Faced
calm Sephora Ulta Macy's HSN and
probably other places where the peach
perfect is only sold at Too Faced calm
and Sephora the Born This Way is $39 the
peach perfect is $36 you get one fluid
ounce in the born this way you get one
point three five fluid ounces in the
peach perfect so you're getting like
more than a quarter more of product in
the peach perfect and it's cheaper so
that's kind of interesting I think part
of the Born This Way cost is that the
glass packaging where the peach perfect
is in the the tube the price per ounce
of course because of that is going to be
worse for the Born This Way price per
ounce is $39 for the Born This Way and
twenty six dollars and 67 cents for the
peach perfect so right now it's like oh
yeah great peach perfect but then you
look at the shade range and the shade
range is not nearly as good in the peach
perfect as it is in the Born This Way
the Born This Way has 24 shades they
recently I believe doubled
or close to doubled their shade range
for Born This Way where peach perfect is
a brand-new foundation so we've got 24
for the Born This Way and 12 for the
peach perfect one thing I noticed was
that the peach perfect ones seemed to
lean a little bit red I was watching
Jackie inés video on this collection
and she showed the deepest shade and it
was like red it looked really red so I
was very you know I don't know I'm not
sure about the shade selection
especially on deeper skin tone
especially after watching a couple of
videos from different women of color and
seeing it swatch on their skin tone it's
kind of like ooh so if you're a woman of
color you're probably gonna have better
luck finding your shade with the Born
This Way the finish claims for each
product the Born This Way is a radiant
natural finish and the peach perfect is
a matte soft focus velvet I'll tell you
right now I have one on one side and one
on the other side from a distance can
you tell the difference that's the
question between the two sides I'm going
to show you in a minute the application
of both sides so that you can see me
applying them to stand and see me up
close but I don't know about that all
right coverage for Born This Way is
medium to full and peach perfect is
medium buildable for me that means the
same thing medium to full medium to
buildable it's to me that's the same
thing just different words application
method recommended by born this way is
fingers sponge or brush and for peach
perfect is fingers and sponge I do find
that I like sponge for both of these
that's my personal preference other
claims for Born This Way is that its
moisturizing brightening skin balancing
and promotes elasticity and with the
peach perfect they claim 14 hours of
wear oil controlling and photo friendly
so speaking of what the claims are for
these products products you know
companies can claim whatever they want
to claim but what it comes down to is
the ingredients so I am going to dig
deep into these ingredients we are going
to analyze the do two out of these
ingredients so if you are not interested
in what the ingredients in these
foundations do what they are I the skip
ahead time is right here feel free to
skip ahead I will not be offended but I
personally feel like there is so much
relevant information in the ingredients
in this that I really feel like I want
to tell you a lot about it so definitely
feel free to skip ahead if you're not
sure
but if you are let me break it down for
you
the biggest thing I want to tell you
about these foundations as they both
have the same base they are both
water-based and cyclo penta siloxane
based if you have a silicon based primer
you may not want to use it with these
foundations because it's more likely to
break the foundation off you want to use
a water-based primer that is like the
Too Faced rx hangover primer or the Too
Faced new to face peach primer
cyclopentyl siloxane is an ingredient
that has been shown to bioaccumulate in
wildlife especially sea life so what I
would recommend removing this foundation
either one of the foundations is to use
an oil-based cleanser wipe it off with
like a tissue or toilet paper or
something that you can throw into the
trash and put into a garbage bag instead
of rinsing it directly down the sink
beyond these two ingredients water and
cyclo penta siloxane they share 40% of
the same ingredients but the 40% is very
mixed up so you are getting different
formulas let's start with Born This Way
and let's talk about the ingredients of
note there first big thing I want you to
know about Born This Way is if you live
in a dry environment the third
ingredient is blisterin and glycerin
takes moisture out of the air and puts
it into your skin to improve hydration
but if there's no moisture in the air it
takes moisture from the lower layers of
your skin and brings it up so definitely
be aware of using this foundation in a
dry environment if you live in Florida
where it's wet year-round then you're
probably gonna be okay the ninth
ingredient and born this way is
dimethicone so if you don't like that if
it clogs your pores you want to stay
away from it
number ten is something called at the
hexohm Methot oxy cinemate say that five
times fast this is kind of a scary one
okay its primary use is in sunscreen and
other cosmetics to absorb UVB rays from
the Sun but there is some evidence to
suggest and they can endocrine
disruption this is a quote from NIH and
I don't want to try to paraphrase it
because I don't want to butcher the
meeting they say endocrine disruptors
are chemicals that may interfere with
the body's endocrine system and produce
adverse developmental reproductive
neurological and immune effects in both
humans and wildlife so
kind of a creepy ingredient in my
opinion but it's based on the studies
that have been done on this ingredient a
lot of them have been done on rats in
very high concentrations but if this
ingredient freaks you out you want to
stay away from the Born This Way
Foundation listen from something scary
into something a little bit happier so
we have magnesium sulfate at number 11
and that is an acne fighting ingredient
it helps to fight acne and inflammation
so that's good there's an irritation
concern with the ingredient number 17
which is propylene carbonate and then
number 18 is another good one it's tetra
hex and deckle as I've never heard of
this one before I mostly review
eyeshadows and this is something I've
never seen before it's a form of vitamin
C and what it does is it's supposed to
increase your collagen levels and it's
supposed to help with hyperpigmentation
is supposed to brighten your skin and
repair the effects of sun damage so
that's pretty awesome this is the number
two ingredient in a product by Perico an
MD called the vitamin C ester serum and
that's a one ounce bottle for a hundred
and five dollars and it is in this I
mean it's down a little bit further at
number 18 but it is in here so that's
pretty cool one thing I didn't mention
was the 1% rule companies must list
ingredients in order from most included
to least included until they get to the
1% line once an ingredient is makes up
less than 1% of the total product they
can list them in any order so I don't
know if this particular one is passed
that 1% line or not next we have coconut
water at number 19 then fxo palmitate
for those of you that are allergic or
who are anti palm oil products for
environment environmental reasons and
number 22 is alcohol so if you don't
like alcohol in your products that is in
there so I know that was a lot of
information but I know that information
is relevant to a lot of people so that's
the dig deep into the Born This Way now
let's dig deep into the peach perfect so
take all the information put it on the
side and let's talk about the other
foundation number four is butylene
glycol which is an irritation concern
for some people and then we get into a
lot of really good ingredients so we
have number six which is silica and
silica is oil absorbing and it also
prevents the light reflection so that is
the photo
friendly foundation piece is that silica
in there then we have phenyl try meth a
comb which slows the loss of water in
the skin magnesium sulfate
again that's the one that's the anti
inflammatory acne fighting ingredient
number 13 is actual peach fruit extract
I was surprised to see this in here and
not just straight-up peach fragrance I
thought that was really cool I looked
into this and I did find some
information surprisingly about it it
supposed to slow water loss to the skin
it's also a form of vitamin C which
slows aging and it is an antioxidant now
this next one I thought was really cool
which was the the sweet fig cream I
don't know what the cream part but
because I don't see any dairy in here
but it does have fig fruit extract the
NIH says in a 4% concentrate they did a
study and it says the formulation
decreased skin melanin so
hyperpigmentation dark spots things like
that water loss from multiple layers of
the skin and decreased oil production it
also increased hydration I thought that
was fascinating I couldn't believe I was
so excited because I heard from Jackie
because I just that was the last video I
watched on this that the Jared put this
in here because something about his
grandma but it seems like it's actually
a really good skin ingredient the next
one is one that might not be good for
some people dimethicone at number 16
clogs pores for some people number 24 is
methyl cone which is a little bit
different this is used to create a
barrier for makeup to stick to so this
helps it to be that 14-hour wear this is
the ingredient that helps with that so
they really are doing well with these
claims as far as backing them up with
ingredients that actually do these
things according to research 25 is
propylene carbonate which is another
irritation concern and then we get the
only big Wawa in this foundation and
it's tocopherol acetate which is a form
of vitamin e there is some evidence to
suggest that it does increase sun
sensitivity it is all the way down at
number 26 so i don't know how much of
this is in here but that's the only big
want won't here for me it does have some
positive effects but from what i've read
the positives don't really outweigh the
negative I'll tell you the positive
anyway it's supposed to help sunscreens
work better that's its main claim it's
also supposed to reduce harm to the skin
from the Sun it's supposed to help the
skin to heal
strengthen the skins barrier and reduce
water loss and number 28 is glycerin
because the glycerin is so far down I'm
not as concerned about dry environments
with the peach perfect as I am with the
born this way so for me there really is
no comparison as far as the quality of
ingredients the peach perfect for me
definitely has better quality
ingredients more skin benefits less harm
no doubt about it if your ingredient
conscious I would definitely go with the
peach perfect and I'm really hoping that
come out with more shades that more
people can try this foundation I've
given you a little hint to my opinion on
the peach perfect but let me go ahead
and show you now the application of the
foundation that I'm wearing today so you
can see how it applies on the skin we do
not want to get foundation in the hair
so we are going to break out the what
decay bare ears I'm very paranoid about
that so here we go no we are prepped we
look a little silly but that's okay we
can deal with this I have the peach
perfect in the shade natural beige I
also have two of the born this ways I
have like beige and I have vanilla now I
found that the peach perfect that I got
is a little bit too dark for my skin
tone I've tried to take it to Sephora
but they did not have these in stock yet
when I went for that vib Rouge event
that they had recently so I am going to
compare it to the light beige from this
one I know it's not an exact match of
shade we're just gonna deal with it and
that's just the way it's gonna be
because I don't have any other choice we
are going to be using the new primed and
peachy cooling matte skin perfecting
primer that just came out with the
collection I did not get a full size but
I am honestly considering getting a full
size one thing to know about this primer
that I will get into when I get to the
full review of this collection is that
it is it's a water-based primer and also
that it does have a lot of glycerin in
it so if you are in a drier environment
you do not want to purchase this primer
go with the hangover RX instead that one
has glycerin and I believe but it is
much further down on the list because
this is a water-based primer
it really seeps into the skin very very
quickly that silicone feeling is very
unattractive for some people so if you
don't like a silicone feeling then this
one and the hangover one may be
something you want to consider investing
in so let's go ahead and start with vite
born this way we're gonna use again to
shade light beige and I'm just going to
do one pump on each side now because I
am only doing half of my face the one
pump is going to kind of be like two
pumps if I had done it all over my
entire face if that makes sense I have
found that my favorite way to apply both
of these foundations is with a Beauty
Blender or some kind of makeup sponge it
doesn't have to be the Beauty Blender
but some kind of makeup sponge because I
feel like I can get the most coverage
with that and it just I feel like it's
got the true intended finish with one of
these sponges I am gonna go down my neck
because you know not the right color and
all so let's go ahead and look at the
difference between the two sides to kind
of show you the coverage of that
foundation and I would call this a
medium to full coverage foundation you
can definitely build this up to full
coverage if you want to okay I am going
to go wash this thoroughly so that I
don't have any more of the Born This Way
Foundation on the sponge and we're gonna
start over again with a clean Beauty
Blender and this side with the new peach
perfect alright Beauty sponge is clean I
do use the Beauty Blender liquid
cleanser with my Beauty blenders I feel
like that is the best way to clean them
that has been my personal experience I
like it better than the solid I think
the liquid does a fantastic job okay now
let's go to the peach perfect now this
one is you know the packaging is a
little bit different but you are paying
more for that glass packaging with the
the Born This Way so let me go ahead and
I'll show you how that one looks on the
hands the consistency is a little
thinner I believe with the peach perfect
then with the Born This Way so let's go
ahead and apply
all right now that I have both sides on
let's go ahead and compare and talk
about the differences I feel like my
lighting is a little bit brighter on
this side because this is where my
sunshine is coming from so I want to
make sure I turn so that you can see it
so the sun's not shining directly on my
face overall this is the big thing that
I noticed the peach perfect side
definitely is more natural-looking in my
opinion it's more CC cream looking it's
less foundation looking where I feel
like the Born This Way side is more
airbrushed it's more perfected it's more
special-occasion going to a wedding
things like that where the peach perfect
to me looks more everyday wearable the
initial application of the peach perfect
is quite dewy but then once it dries
down it seems like the Born This Way is
a little bit more a little more satiny
it's a little more luminous where this
one is a little more matte I wouldn't
say that it's completely matte but it's
it's closer to Matt than the Born This
Way I do want to note that you can build
up this foundation to a pretty full
coverage I've used this a couple of
different ways with more foundation less
foundation different primers and I feel
like this can definitely be brought up
to looking a little bit more like the
Born This Way as far as the coverage
goes but I do still feel like it looks
more natural than the Born This Way
which is kind of ironic considering that
was the whole idea behind Born This Way
was that it was supposed to look natural
I've never believed it to look natural
it's just a little more intense of a
foundation so you just have to decide
what your personal preferences are as
far as the coverage goes just for extra
information I'm gonna go ahead and apply
the new peach perfect powder over both
sides so you can see how it looks when
it is set with a powder I'm purposely
not going to use a concealer because I
don't want the concealer to interfere
with what you're seeing so now I have
set the Born This Way let's go ahead and
set the peach perfect this is both sides
set with the two face powder I will give
you a little preview of that review I
love the powder it is my favorite thing
in the new collection
I'm dying over it is super super fab so
yeah so that's the way both sides look
set at this point I'm going to go ahead
and do the rest of my face and I will
let you get back to the rest of the
video you have seen the foundation
applied for yourself I've told you about
all of the ingredients I've given you a
breakdown on price per gram and things
like that now it is time for me to
inject my opinion into this review I
like the peach perfect better just say
that and the reason why is I like the
finish better for me personally I like a
foundation to even out my skin tone
gently without giving that airbrushed
finished I feel like the airbrush finish
to me looks kind of fake on me if you
like the airbrush finish you're probably
gonna like the finish on the Born This
Way better as far as oxidation I haven't
had either foundation change on me
through the day so that's a really good
thing I would love to know in the
comments below whether you've had that
experience with either of the
foundations for as oxidation other
people seem to notice oxidation more
than I do so I don't want to be like
rule on that but for me I haven't
noticed where time on both the
foundations is really good for me except
for with the Born This Way I do notice a
lot of times taking around my nose and
on my chin and on my forehead and I
don't have an oily t-zone or anything I
don't know why I don't notice that with
the peach perfect so that's another plus
for the peach perfect one thing that's
gonna be a no for you is the peach
perfect does have a sense so if you
don't like cents you want to go with the
Born This Way over the peach perfect
because you can definitely smell the
scent on this when I first tried it in
my first impressions video that I did on
this line I couldn't really smell it but
the more I've used it the more I can
definitely smell it I can't smell it on
my skin now like after a while but on
application you can definitely smell the
peach scent I am gonna put in here a
picture of my face at the end of the day
today lighting is a little bit different
because the Sun has gone down at that
point but I do want to show you the wear
time as you can see there is about
I don't know 50% of the foundation left
on my face they both do we're down but I
do feel like both of these foundations
can last an entire school or work day
without significant wear down again you
want to make sure you use water-based
primer with these foundations because
you will have the best lasting power
with those you'll be less likely to
break up on your face because it is they
both are water-based foundations as of
final final thoughts if I had to pick
between the two peach perfect would
definitely be my choice for it lots and
lots of reasons a big reason why this
one's a yes over this one is that I can
find my shade in this if you can't find
your shade in this I think that's gonna
be the huge no on this there's also the
option of using it if you have color
changing drops like they make I think
Nick's makes some I know ultimate some
at one point I don't know if they still
do cover effects they make color
changing drops so that you can kind of
tweak your foundation but that is a lot
of work for some people some people
don't want to go through all of that in
order to change the color of their
foundation or mix it with other
foundations but it really is a very very
nice product and I highly recommend it
this one on the other hand the once I
did the ingredient analysis on it it
really does kind of freak me out I
honestly don't think I'm going to be
using this anymore because that
ingredient really scares me where this
one doesn't have that crazy ingredient I
think it is important to note though
that every ingredient in this is FDA
approved but for me that is not good
enough that the the research on it just
it's not worth it to me and I'm not
going to use this anymore but there
that's just my personal comfort level I
had no judgment if you do not find
anything wrong with using this
foundation it is totally up to you we
inhale and eat and drink lots of bad
things every single day and that may or
may it may or may not affect you I don't
know for me this is going to be a no for
me on that so I want to thank you so
