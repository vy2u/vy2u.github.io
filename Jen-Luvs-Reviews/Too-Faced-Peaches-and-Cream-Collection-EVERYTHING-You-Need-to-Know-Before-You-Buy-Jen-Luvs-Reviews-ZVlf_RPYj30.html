the two-faced peaches and cream
collection I have been trying these
products are trying these products over
the past couple of weeks to make sure I
can give you the best review of these
products possible and I cannot wait to
share my thoughts with you right now as
you may know if this is not your first
rodeo with me my reviews are quite long
I always put timestamps in the
description down below in case you'd
like to skip ahead to a specific section
the one that I would recommend if you
have no time is to skip to the full
review of the products but the way that
I feel about things may not be the same
way that you feel about them so I feel
like the details in the beginning are
important to decide whether or whether
we agree on certain aspects of it
because just because I like it doesn't
mean you like it and just cuz I don't
like it doesn't mean you won't like it
that's why the beginning part is
important if you don't have time full
review is going to be right at this
timestamp right there I want to take a
minute to thank the lovely folks over in
the super chat in my live chat for
helping me to purchase the products in
this video for awhile I did have the
super chat and abled which means that
people were able to donate money to the
channel and as a thank you I would let
you know what you helped me to purchase
so these are the lovely folks that
helped me to purchase the products in
the Too Faced peaches-and-cream
collection without them I probably would
have purchased maybe two or three
products but because of them I was able
to buy a lot more from the collection to
share with you so thank you so much for
donating to the super chat not sure
exactly when it's gonna be turned back
on but I'm not planning on turning it on
anytime soon there's so many things you
guys can spend your money on as far as
gifts for your friends and family and
donating to people who are in crisis I
just don't feel like it's right to turn
it on right now but maybe sometime in
2018 will turn the super chat that gone
let's go ahead and start with some
details about Too Faced the products
here by the way if you live in the UK
and Ireland they will be available in
November so keep your eye out for those
and that's information from the Too
Faced website two-faced is a
cruelty-free brand but their parent
company Estee Lauder is not cruelty free
so depending on how cruelty-free you are
in your heart and in your mind two-faced
may or may not be a cruelty-free brand
to you it is not a vegan brand there's
carmine and a quite a few of these
products the products are bulk made in
the USA but they are assembled in the
Dominican Republic nothing on any of
these products say made in China I have
so many products to share with you that
I'm going to give you kind of the nitty
gritty on each product then I'm going to
show you how I got this look today along
with swatches of the eyeshadow palette
on both light skin and deep skin my
melanin rich friend debi came over to
help me with the swatches and I'm so so
thankful so I actually have deep skin
swatches for you which I'm really
excited about the last thing I wanted to
mention about these products is they can
only be purchased at Sephora or at Too
Faced calm let's go ahead and start in
the order that I put them on my faces
we're gonna start with the primed and
peachy primer it is $30 it's 40
milliliters or 1.35 ounces of product
which equals $22 per ounce I looked at
Sephora's website and I sorted it by the
most popular face primers and this one
is by far the least expensive I'm gonna
put some information on the screen for
you right now
so you can compare to maybe you're a
possible favorite primer from Sephora as
you can see the closest one to this is
the fenty primer at $30 per ounce one
thing that they do say from Too Faced
about this I'm just gonna read it off
the website it says skin shiny midday
apply a small amount of the pnc primer
on top of your foundation to gently by
gently patting a thin layer onto skin
with fingertips to mattify and absorb
shine because that's not a problem that
I typically have I couldn't test that
claim but if that's you that's something
you might want to look into with this
definitely watch an oily skin girl
review of this that's not something I
can speak on unfortunately but I did
want to mention it four ingredients this
is a water and glycerin based product
and if you've seen my reviews recently
I've talked a lot about glycerin and how
glycerin is something you definitely
don't want to put on your skin if you
live in a dry environment because the
glycerin will try to pull moisture out
of the air but if it can't find the
moisture in the air it will pull
moisture from the lower layers of your
skin dehydrating your skin so if you
live in a dry environment or if in the
wintertime it's just really dry you
definitely don't want to use this then
maybe save it for spring and summer
their ingredients of note there is talc
in this it is the fifth ingredient so if
you're sensitive to talc this is a no-go
for you there's also fragrance in here
and something called benzyl benzoate
which is something that is in a lot of
these products now that's supposed to be
avoided by people who have a perfume
allergy so if you specifically have a
perfume allergy you don't want a lot of
these products I'll let you know in each
one whether you need to be careful of
that now I'll give you my full review on
what I think of this all at the end I'm
going to tell you all my review stuff at
the very end so let's move on to the
peach perfect foundation I did want to
dig really deep with the peach perfect
foundation so I did do a full review of
this product but let me just tell you
just the basics about it it is $36 and I
actually made a mistake on the Alice's
that are in this if you look at them you
can see that there is a bigger bottle
with the foundation than there is with
the primer so there is more in here so
it's actually even better value than
what I said in the full review of this
product so when I looked at the Box in
the bottle I noticed that it was one
point six ounces which makes it $22.50
per ounce on Sephora's website I sorted
by the most popular foundations and if
you look at it I mean the really the
closest thing again for price per ounce
is the fenty at $31 per ounce but this
is still significantly less expensive
than the most popular foundations at
Sephora it does come in twelve shades
but I do it does look like they kind of
lean light I'm hoping that this is loved
enough that they come out with deeper
shade soon I did talk with the brand rep
from Too Faced at generation Beauty and
she said it kind of just depends on the
sales of it whether they'll keep it
around or not so hopefully I'm really
hoping to come up with deeper shades of
this because it looks like there's like
really just like two deep shades maybe
three if but that's kind of pushing it
so crossing my fingers on that overall
has great ingredients again see the full
review for all of that information on
this the mattifying setting powder is
probably one of the most exciting things
i have to share with you from this line
this is i'm just gonna skip to the
review for a second this is my favorite
product in the line it's stinkin amazing
okay so it's $32 though it's not like a
less expensive product the price per
gram for this product is
sanely cheap it's only 91 cents per gram
again I'm gonna throw up those popular
brands on the screen and you can see
nothing even comes close except for
maybe the laura mercier translucent
powder which I was really surprised that
that one was that little money for what
you get because that's a fantastic
powder as well just out of curiosity I
went over to Alta and I checked out some
drugstore mineral powders loose mineral
powders the uLTA Beauty one was a dollar
ninety per gram so it's actually like
half as expensive per gram of product
for this than the Ulta brand one now I
looked at the NYX NYX it's currently on
sale for $6.99 but if you look at the
original price for the NYX it's a dollar
twenty six so the Too Faced beats that
as well if you go for the sale price for
the NYX then the NYX now gets a little
bit cheaper but the I mean it's
fantastic for how much product you get
it's it's a really great deal the
directions from two faces that you're
supposed to apply the setting powder
while the foundation is still damp to
really lock down your foundation it is a
talc and cornstarch based product
there's also sodium saccharin in this
which is sweet and low if you get this
in your mouth a little bit you can
actually taste saccharin in your mouth
like a sweet kind of taste it's very
very odd but I would not complain
someone had asked me if because it has
the saccharin and it would bacteria like
love this powder and with the bacteria
just like eat it up on your face I
couldn't find any research to back that
up if you ever find something please
leave it in the comments down below and
I will add it to the video description
because I looked and I could not find it
next up the Just Peachy
mattes palette you're getting twelve all
matte shades in here and you get the
very very large mirror I really like
this packaging just to start the review
a little bit because I just can't stop
it's $45 each pan is one point two five
grams leaving 215 grams of product and
that's about three dollars per gram
which is actually more than any other
Too Faced palette that I own usually Too
Faced palettes kind of hover around that
two dollars and seventy five cents two
dollars and 88 cents per gram product so
this is kind of pricey for a two-faced
product but it's still less than a lot
of other popular products on the market
including urban decay and on Stassi O so
that is that there it is a talc based
product there is
carmine in here which is not crushed
beetles I learned in the last video it's
crushed bugs
it's a bug not a beetle they and they're
not cross mate they squeeze the juice
out of them basically and they make a
red pigment out of them which is really
disgusting so that grosses you out you
want to stay away from this product and
there's another product later on that
I'm going to show you there is fragrance
in here it does seem to be both lip and
eye safe so if you want to change up
your lipstick tone by adding a little
shadow it seems to be lip safe
next up the sweetie pie bronzer I almost
didn't get this but it was just so
pretty and I've been seeing sneaks of
this for like two years so I just
decided to get it it's $30 it's thirteen
point five grams of product which equals
two dollars and 22 cents per gram and
again the comparisons on the screen
right now the Sephora collection powder
bronzer is the only one that I could
find that was even close to the same
price per gram here again a very good
deal as far as its comparison brands
that are in similar price points
it is talc and cornstarch based as well
the third ingredient is Dianetics if you
don't like dimethicone in your makeup
products then you may want to skip this
it can be acne causing to some people I
don't know if because it's a powder if
it won't you know go so deep into your
skin as maybe a foundation would but I
did want to let you know it does have
dimethicone it also has fragrance and
that benzyl benzoate so if you're
sensitive perfumes skip it
one thing that was really interesting is
they had it listed that there were four
shades in here and I can see three
shades so I don't really know if maybe
one of them was the overspray that came
off of this I'll put an original picture
up here so you can see what the
overspray looks like I'm thinking that
might have been it so illicit as bronze
peach as one of the shades that has a
specific formula so I guess maybe that's
the overspray and then three other
shades candy peach caramelized peach and
golden peach I think that might be the
three shades that I see in here I don't
know the reason why that's important is
only if you decide to use this for
something different meaning you want to
use it on your eyes or lips it is not
lips safe and it may not be I safe it
says red six one of the red six is I
safe and the other one isn't so when
they don't say
D&amp;amp;C red 6 or red 6 lake-like
I don't know which one it's talking
about so it's possible that this may not
be I safe I think it's the pink one in
there that I would imagine would be the
shade that would be questionable but put
it on your eyes at your own risk
next up I got the peach a frost
highlighter and they did come out with
blushes as well because I got the
bronzer I decided to kind of use that
for blush and got this instead because I
didn't have a highlighter so I wanted to
use this and I don't have a lot of cream
highlighters so I thought it would be
fun
it's called peach frost it's $30 it's
twelve point five grams which is two
dollars and forty cents per gram of
product again very inexpensive compared
to the most popular products on
sephora.com the first ingredient in this
is cap relief and capric triglyceride
which is used in a lot of skin care
products it's a lightweight non-greasy
barrier for lubrication it's supposed to
be gentle to the skin and it's also
supposed to replenish the skin's
moisture the other thing about that is
it has a really really really long shelf
life that particular ingredient I don't
know about the other ingredients in here
but the main ingredient this has a
really long shelf life so that's a
really good thing there's also that
benzyl benzoate in here and the
fragrance it also has carmine in here
which was a really surprised because I
wouldn't think that like I don't see
very much red in here so I was very
surprised to see carmine in here but
it's in here and then the last thing I
got to peach kiss lipsticks I got the
shades sex on the peach and drunk-dial
I'm wearing sex on the peach on my lips
right now and you'll see drunk-dial
when i zoom in and do the demo of the
products they're $21 each you get four
grams of product which leads it to $5.25
per gram found that are more Sephora
typical price per gram so looking at the
comparison the Urban Decay vice
lipsticks are less expensive Anasazi
Azhar about the same bite beauty's just
a little bit more so I mean not a
fantastic value on these like the other
products but definitely still fair now
it does come with twenty shades there is
fragrance in here and also benzyl
benzoate so now that I've done
the nitty-gritty of each product I'm
gonna go ahead and show you a demo of
how I got this look today that way you
can see how it applies on my face and
see whether that's something that you
think is gonna work for you or not so go
ahead and watch that right now alright
my friend are you ready to see how these
products work let's go ahead and start
with the primed and peachy primer and
you can see it does have a little bit of
a peach tint but when I rub it into my
skin tone I can't see anything at all
it's supposed to have a slight color
correcting effect I only noticed that on
my skin tone maybe other skin tones
would notice it more than I do I love
the way this primer feels water-based
primer is just feel nice to me because
they're not Whaley or greasy in any way
they just seep into the skin super
nicely and then this is the foundation
so you can see it is a bit liquidy it's
definitely not a serum foundation but it
is a bit liquidy you'll notice that the
shade is a bit dark for me I am planning
on trading it in for a lighter shade
this was the one that was described as
light/medium and it's called natural
beige and either I'm getting lighter or
the light medium interface just isn't
the right shade for me one thing I
wanted to mention about this foundation
that I did not get correct in the
original review is if this does have
artificial fragrance in it somehow it
got deleted from my notes so if you are
sensitive to fragrance you definitely
want to stay away from this as you can
see it does blend into the skin very
very nicely with a beauty sponge and I
like this foundation it kind of reminds
me in coverage of the it cosmetics CC
cream or just CC creams in general just
because it looks really natural on the
skin again for the full review you can
see that down below and this is with one
pump of foundation on my face I've seen
a lot of reviews where they use a lot of
pumps we're just going to go with two
today so now we're starting off with the
second coat or these second pumps so
this is just one additional pump on my
face
again just tapping and pressing it in
with the beauty blender you can also
roll this it just kind of depends on
what your personal preference is with
the beauty sponge I like to Pat and
press rather than roll I don't know it's
just me and you can see already that the
coverage is getting built up it's also
very shiny at this point but that's
because it's still wet when it does dry
down it ends up being more of a soft mat
with a satiny matte it's not a matte and
flat look and this is my face with the
second coat of foundation you can see we
definitely built up the coverage to more
of a closer to full coverage this is the
peach powder and this again is one of my
favorite products if not my favorite
product in the line just because of the
mattifying effect of it again not matte
and flat it really gives a nice look to
the skin you can see that my right side
that you're looking at now has the
powder on it and then my left side has
no powder and you can see how it just
took the shine right away
and you can see the powder just flying
everywhere that's because I didn't tap
off my brush very well also just a note
I am using a flat kabuki here because I
found that I've really been enjoying
pressing powder into my skin rather than
fluffing it all over that's been a
personal preference but you just have to
find which way works best for you now
we're gonna go into the bronzer and I am
using a very very dense brush with this
because I wanted to get a lot of color
and I find that this bronzer if you use
too fluffy a brush it just takes a long
time to build up the color color and I
just didn't have the patience do that
today so I'm using a brush with lots and
lots of densely packed bristles to make
sure I get full color payoff it's really
not buildable beyond this level there's
there it just doesn't get darker than
this so definitely keep that in mind and
keep your skin tone in mind when
deciding if you want to purchase it now
we're gonna go into the highlighter and
I'm really digging in with this
stippling brush from Oda I couldn't find
myself small stippling brush so I use
this larger stippling brush and it works
much much better for me than with my
fingertips I feel like it just applies
it more lightly it just it makes it so
that it doesn't blend away where I'm
gonna show you the fingertip application
and you definitely still can see the
highlight but I feel like you can barely
see it compared to the other side when I
use the stippling brush I mean you can
see it but I prefer a more pop you
highlight so I go with the stippling
brush if you want something even more
subtle you'll go for the finger tips in
my opinion now here's the lipstick this
one is a really nice lipstick it is a
little bit grey it's like a gray toned
peach kind of shade but if you like
those cool toned lipsticks this might be
a good it shade for you a full review on
all of this stuff of course is coming I
do really like these lipsticks as far as
the hydration though this one drunk-dial
I wanted to get in neutral and then I
wanted to get a more bold to see if the
bold would seat outside my
line and thankfully this one doesn't
it's very very nice I do love this shade
I'm starting to try to get into more
bold lipsticks and this definitely fits
the bill I'll tell you that you can see
it's not completely mad it's got a
little bit of a satin finish to it I'm
looking at this I feel like I look so
much like my mother without eye makeup
on now we're gonna go ahead and add that
eye makeup we've got in the Too Faced
shadow insurance if I thought it was
only fair to use the shadow insurance
with this eye shadow palette I'm gonna
go ahead and into peach tea that is the
transition color for me when you see the
deep skin swatches you might get a
better idea of what transition colors
might work for your skin tone if your
different skin tone than I am but peach
tea is definitely a great transition for
me transition shades are typically a
couple of shades deeper than your
natural skin tone and now we're gonna go
into Just Peachy and Pat that all over
the lids except for I'm gonna leave that
inner corner bare because I want to
brighten that up with a lighter color
this is a mode of prison Matic brush by
the way if they're packing eyeshadow
brush I forget exactly what it's called
and now let's going to peach butter I do
like peach butter better than peach
meringue I feel like it's more pigmented
and punchy where I feel like peach
meringue kind of disappears sometimes on
my lid
it's deepen it up a little bit with
peach sangria now this one does have a
little bit of a satin finish to it I
wouldn't call it shimmery I
more satin it does have a lot of it
material you can see you definitely only
need the tiniest little bit on your
brush in order to get a lot of pigments
now I'm kind of winging it out on the
side because I like that with my
personal eye shape and into peach tart
just to deepen up the outer corner and
kind of up into the crease a little bit
this is a brush by bare minerals by the
way and I really like this brush I got
it in a bare minerals mystery bag and I
use it all the time it's super fab and
now we're just blending it out with a
Luxy brush no product on that Luxy brush
just blending out the current color and
back into peach butter for the brow bone
to kind of soften up that peach sangria
so it's not a harsh line there's one to
blend that out
I really wanted my lids to pop with that
peach so I'm just dabbing into Just
Peachy again just with my fingertip to
really make it punch and just blending
it slightly in the peach butter all
right I'm gonna go ahead and do liner
and lashes and boom there it is liner
and I just did mascara today because I
really wanted you to be able to see the
eye look now I decided that with my eye
look I didn't like it be drunk-dial so I
ended up putting the other one back on
and I like sex on the peach much better
with this look now we're just gonna go
into the lower lash line a little bit
with peach tart down in the outer corner
kind of pulling that into the center
it's a way to kind of deepen up your
lower lash line without looking too
harsh and then peach butter again on the
lower lash line from the inner corner to
the center all right this is the final
look and I do really like the way that
it came out I find the shadows to be
easy to blend and for the most part
buildable some of them you have to be
careful of strong pigmentation but
overall I feel like these shadows are
performing great and I'm really enjoying
them
totally forgot to do the little
transition into showing you the swatches
so let's just jump right into the
swatches of this palette we're gonna do
both my skintone and then we're gonna do
a deep skin tone with my friend Debbie
in just a second so this is people rank
peach tea peach cobbler and peach tart
and as you can see this the finger
swatches really aren't super fab they
look kind of patchy but you'll notice
what the brush swatch is for the most
part they do look pretty good like I was
mentioning in the tutorial slash demo
part the peach wearing shade is kind of
weak you can use different brushes with
this to really pull off a little bit
more pigmentation but overall it is kind
of a weak shade the other shades are
better
peach cobbler is fantastic that's
definitely my favorite shade in this
first row and one thing I noticed as I
was editing these swatches is it seems
like the the rows are set up by skin
tones the top row could be really great
for lighter skin tone the middle row for
medium skin tones and the bottom row for
deep skin tones which I thought was
really really cool if you're new to my
channel you're new to the white test so
this is just to kind of simulate what
would happen through a long day so I
wiped them away to see the have the
staining power of the shadows and you
can see they all hang around except for
that very first very light shade let's
move on to the next row which is peach
butter just peachy peach punch and just
ripe and again the finger swatches are
not super impressive
I was surprised peach butter came off so
badly on my arm because I don't feel
like that's represented over the house
the eyes now you'll notice that Pete
Just Peachy is pretty good peach punch
is stinking amazing and it does kind of
look like juice you know it reminds me
of juice and just right this also a
really nice shade that one is buildable
this is just one dip into the pan if you
do a second dip it actually comes out
better again the same thing is the first
row those last three hang on the first
one disappears and the final row this is
peaches and cream fresh picked peach
sangria and chocolate dipped
I really like this role I feel like this
is my favorite row in the palette I feel
like they are all solid shades peach
sangria is probably the patches but it's
really not even that patchy
chocolate-dipped is gorgeous for a deep
brown like that to be that smooth I mean
it's just it's absolutely beautiful this
is a fantastic row it's it's not
probably my favorite it's my favorite
and if you look at the white tests the
way that they wipe away you can see
they're also there of course peaches and
cream is the lightest and that's typical
for lighter shades to wipe away easier
now let's go ahead and grab daddy's arm
this is the first month ever done
swatches on someone's arm other than my
own so my finger swatches came out
really really really in bad so
definitely take the brush swatches for
this one the brush swatches definitely
look better you can see that peach tea
pretty much disappears on her skin tone
up by the way Deb he doesn't wear makeup
so I don't even know her foundation
shade she has no idea she just came over
to let me use her arm but you can see
that three out of those four shades look
pretty good on her
moving on to that second row
fingers Boches are getting a little bit
better here
peach butter really shows up on on her
skin it looks really great and all of
them really do honestly if you look at
the swatches as they start appearing I
mean that peach punch this is probably
one of my favorite shades in the palette
so if you dig on that color definitely
oh my gosh is awesome
and there's Row 2 on Debbie's skin and I
think this row looks great on her this
last row again my favorite row in the
palette and it's just as beautiful on
Debbie if not more beautiful than it was
on me I mean you can just see the punch
of pigment and every single shade with
the brush swatches they just they're
really really beautiful
this one actually might be a nice
transition color for her the fresh
picked shade peach sangria looks amazing
on her skin tone and I just can't get
over it
and that's it on Debbie's arms hopefully
that was helpful to those of you out
there that have a similar skin tone to
her now it is time for me to give you my
full review on all of these products so
let's go in the same order that I went a
moment ago when I gave you kind of the
breakdown of each product so starting
with the primed and peachy now I got a
sample of the pregnancy I was like yes
I'm so excited I can use this for the
review and I liked it so much that I got
a full-size of it one thing I really
like about it is it is a water-based
product so it doesn't give you that
thick heavy silicone feel that is really
annoying to some people some people love
the way silicone makes their skin feel
but personally I kind of like the more
water-based primers they just make me
feel happier I mean a good silicone
primer every once in a while but I
prefer the water-based primer so that
make me really happy you can smell the
fragrance quite a bit in the primer I'm
just letting you know that right now the
fragrance is pretty strong it does dry
pretty much immediately once you start
rubbing it into your skin it dries very
very fast I do feel like it helps
increase the longevity of my makeup and
I really like it I think that it's great
is it a must-have I don't know if it's a
must-have I think that it's a must try
if you don't mind the fragrance I think
it's a must try go into if you can go
into Sephora and see if you can get
yourself a sample of it I definitely
think it's worth giving it a try if you
like water-based primers like I was
saying earlier I really really love the
peach perfect powder what's really gonna
knock this out for you is if you don't
like the fragrance and the scent but oh
my gosh this stuff works it's so fab I
have used this with three different
foundations three different foundations
yes and it is worked beautifully with
all of them so my other favorite loose
powders are the Laura Mercier one and
the bare minerals one and I absolutely
love this I can't say I like it better
than the other ones but it's definitely
I would say equal and because of the
scent the scent and the taste thing I
love I'm very sensory person so when
something is nice sensory wise I really
enjoy it when something is bad sensory
rut wise it is not a good thing for me
and it is a no-go
this one is very nice for me I love the
sin of it it just makes me happy in my
heart it works really well it mattifying
my skin I do have normal skin though so
I can't speak to whether it whale will
poke through it or not but it does
really make my foundation look beautiful
and I'm very happy with this product the
Just Peachy mattes palette this is also
going to be a positive review I love the
packaging the packaging is super cute it
kind of reminds me of the Casey Holmes
that was the first thing I saw that had
this kind of packaging that was almost
like rubberized here the Casey Holmes
highlighter palette and I really like it
I think it's beautiful the clasp is not
super strong though it's a magnetic
closure not a clip closure not a clasp
closure if no it looks like a clasp it's
a magnet so just be aware if you're
using this in travel you might want to
put it in some kind of bag or something
and not just leave it open because I can
see it definitely opening up in travel
and honestly I really like the quality
of these I do like my visi art mats
palette better than this I feel like
they're easier to plant I feel like the
longevity is better but really that's
the only matte formula that I would say
I like better than this they're really
good they're very easy to blend I feel
like the lasting power is really good
it'll last a solid six to eight hours
without fading but by like that ten
twelve hour mark it kind of looks like
doodoo so just be aware you probably
like if you put it on the morning you
probably can't really carry it over into
the evening without it kind of look and
law but but really truly very easy to
work with I love the color selection I
love how it's organized with the light
the middle and the deep I love that they
went light medium and deep so that
people from many different skin tones
would be able to use this and I really
love it a lot
there is one shade in here that has a
tiny bit of shimmer in it and it's this
peach sangria shade but I feel like on
the Ally you can't really see it so I
wouldn't really call it a shimmer or
like but even though it does have in the
pan just the tad bit of shimmer to it
and I really have nothing negative to
say about this other than it is not the
same as an $80 eye shadow that's very
much the only negative I have but for
the price point it really really is
great the sweetie pie bronzer I think is
going to be wonderful if you have my
skin tone or like
if you have anything deeper than me I
don't think this is gonna show up very
well on your skin it is a very light
brown shade okay I'm gonna go ahead and
swatch the benefits hoola bronzer next
to this one okay this one right here is
the hoola and this one is the Too Faced
and you can see that the hoola is
definitely darker so hoola is way too
light for you this is not gonna show up
at all I mean it's just a very light
peachy bronze shade I do like for me
that this can be used almost as a blush
I am wearing it like a blush today I had
the overspray was a little bit weird
that was on here when I first got it
here's a picture of it with the
overspray on it it did give me almost
the highlighted look it was very shiny
but that overspray came off and like two
uses so don't count along that to stay
it is more of like a satiny finish
bronzer there's no glitter in it but
there's no it's not completely matte
either I am enjoying it for me a lasting
power is pretty good not fantastic it
will last me again through a like a work
school day amount of hours a good six to
eight hours before it's pretty much gone
by the eight hour mark by ten hours it's
definitely gone when I first got it I
wasn't sure if I was going to keep it
but the more I've used it the more I've
really liked it and I did decide I am
going to keep it because I do like the
way it looks on my skin tone just fair
warning if you are deeper than me it
probably won't show up I would
definitely recommend if you can
swatching it in store but chances are
it's just not gonna it's not going to
work unfortunately but I do love the
packaging again it's got that rubberized
kind of packaging on the front this is a
click closure unlike the palette this
one is not magnetic it's the little
click clasp there but I do like it but
you may or may not like it okay the
peach frost highlighter this isn't one
that I absolutely hated the first three
times that I use it I was like I can't
see it I was applying with my fingertips
and patting it on my fingertips and it's
like where did it go where did it go
blasting powder on this is not very good
I do find that if I apply it with a
stippling brush it's much better it is a
more subtle highlight it is not you're
pumping Jacqueline Hill from space Becca
high layer this is like a lot more
subtle it's
it's okay it's fine I do like that
there's a cute little mirror in here and
again adorable packaging
this one has a magnetic closure on it
rather than a clasp closure so
definitely be careful with it in travel
I'm kind of on the fence on this one I
think if there was anything that I had
to say was my least favorite product it
would definitely be this highlighter
just because I like a nice punch in a
nice pop to my highlighter and also at
about the 4-hour mark it's relatively
gone for me which is not the same as the
rest of the collection it's kind of
disappointing I've used this I think six
or seven times at this point six or
seven but I've used it quite a bit and
it just doesn't last on my skin at all
so this is unfortunately not a recommend
for me unless you want to reapply it or
if you like something that's super super
subtle so it just kind of me and then
last up are the peach kiss lipsticks
they smell really really good when I
first smelled them all I could smell was
vanilla right now I can smell the peach
in them but they're more of a creamy
peach than the rest of the collection
the rest of the collection is more true
peachy candy peachy where these are more
of like a vanilla peach I love the scent
to them I think they're beautiful with
the stamp in them and a little thing
here if you watch my whatsapp and makeup
news show you saw that Tasha is suing
them over this packaging because it's
very similar to the packaging of Natasha
I have not heard any updates on that
story if I hear any updates it will
definitely be in what's up and makeup if
I could find out what happened Tasha was
trying to stop these lipsticks from
coming out it did not work they released
them anyway so we'll see what happens
with that but as far as the performance
of the lipstick they're very when I
first got them they were very creamy to
go on they slid really really well but I
find that the more I use them they're
getting a little tougher to apply
they're a little bit more stiff to apply
so I would imagine that as these aged
they may be harder and harder they may
start drying out more but right now
they're very very comfortable the darker
shade that I have the shade drunk-dial
this one stains my lips which I
personally really really like and it's
not a yucky stain it's not like it just
sticks to my dry patches it stains the
entire lip so even after the lipstick
has more
off it still has a little bit of purple
on my lips which I personally really
like I haven't had any bleeding problems
with either of these even without a lip
liner without any other help with it I
have had no problem with bleeding
they're a very creamy formula I
personally love the scent the scent does
linger a bit on the lips though so if
you don't like sense you're not gonna
like this I mean and that pretty much
goes for the entire collection
everything smells like peaches if you
don't like that you don't want anything
but to be completely honest I mean
really the only thing that I would say
you might be able to stand would be the
eyeshadow palette and the sweetie pie
bronzer and the highlighter just because
those dissipate really really fast where
like the peach perfect powder and the
foundation and the primer those buffs
and the Panda lipstick those the set
lasts a lot longer on your face so I
definitely wouldn't recommend those but
this is definitely not going to be for
you if this is if you're not into the
sense you're not going to want anything
here unfortunately but the lipsticks I
mean if you are in for a higher-end
lipstick I like these better than the
new honest Asya ones I don't care for
that formula at all it's way too dry for
me these are a little bit more hydrating
these don't bleed as much as the la
creme lipsticks by Too Faced but they
aren't quite as soft as the la creme
they're not quite as comfortable but
they're even though they're a matte
formula they're not uncomfortable in any
way they're not liquid lipstick transfer
proof or anything like that they're just
lip sticky so over I really like them
but price point is a little high for me
and my what I consider what I like to
spend on a lipstick I'm more of like a
$10 girl when it comes to lipsticks what
I feel comfortable buying if I buy three
or four of them it would have to be like
at the $10 price point that's just me
this is a little pricey for me to have
more than two but I am very happy that I
have the two I like them a lot now
before I go I did want to mention a
couple of products that have decided I'm
not going to do a full review on the I
want candy eyeshadow palette and the I
want candy banana powder the banana
powder is currently sold out on Too
Faced website I'm not sure if it's sold
out at Ulta yet and you may be able to
find it in sort alta for you this was a
product that I shouldn't have bought
because this is a product that is not
something that
I am good at using that I've practiced
using and I don't feel like I can give a
truly fair review on it as far as using
it for its intended purpose which is a
light color correcting it is a
brightening face powder and it's got
these little color correcting colors in
there and it doesn't really do much for
me I did want to mention it because the
scent is not good on this in my opinion
candy said it smelled like vanilla
wafers to me it just smells like makeup
it with like a little bit of sweet in it
I don't enjoy the scent of this at all I
love the scent of fake banana like
banana candy banana scented I loved it
that was what I was hoping for it's not
here they missed it completely and I did
want to mention that but as far as the
performance of this I can't figure out a
way to use this that I enjoy I like
different under-eye brightening powders
better that I have like I really love
using my honest Asya contour kit as an
under-eye brightening powder and I just
I don't feel like this is something that
I should have purchased but the banana
called to me and candy because I love
her so yeah so that's that but I do have
a more educated opinion on this Too
Faced I want candy palette it's super
super cute and I love love love these
shadows down here these bases that she
put down there that they're supposed to
be electro transformative colors what
I've done is I actually did looks with
each one of these and then I did some
looks kind of mixing the shades and I
loved them all every look I made I loved
my only thing is is that I feel like if
you have a deeper skin tone this may be
a supplemental palette for you because I
feel like there isn't a whole lot of
deep it looks like there's some deep
that you can use like these guys down
here to kind of deepen it up but there's
a lot of light in here whipped cream is
a very special shade I love the shade
whipped cream but the other shades I
finally to be very typical to face
formula I feel like the matte palette is
a little bit better as far as the
quality of it overall where this one is
a little more typical to face they are
good shadows but they're not great
shadows well I love whipped cream oh my
gosh layering whipped cream underneath
some of these shades it's just beautiful
I I know I'm gonna hit pan on whipped
cream because I find myself
keeping reaching for it even when I'm
using
palates I reached for a whipped-cream to
kind of give it that shimmery look it's
kind of like you remember the it
cosmetics naturally pretty palette how
they had that shadow that was supposed
to be like the transforming pearl that
you were supposed to put over the other
shadows to make them shimmery like that
this whipped cream is what they tried to
do and failed whipped cream it does that
and it's amazing but I usually put it
underneath instead of over top I do not
think this is a must-have eyeshadow
palette but again if you love candy you
may want to get it to support her
because it is a good palette I think
you're gonna find that you get your
money's worth but it's definitely not
like oh my gosh run out and get it today
