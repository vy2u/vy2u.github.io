like peach rings everybody was like yes
beige rings like I don't know what's up
with that like it like it smells like
Canyon we just like have to have it
hello my friends welcome to the
two-faced smelly pallets down I have
four of the two-faced smelly pallets I
call them the smelly pallets because
they smell they smell good actually they
smell really good so it's a little bit
of a deceiving name but you know so we
have two that smell like chocolate one
the smells like peanut butter and one
this mullick peach and all of them are
from my favorite high-end brand which is
two-faced now to face is about 90%
accuracy with me for good products every
once while we get some messes but we got
some good stuff here that I want to
share with you but this is the thing do
you really need all four of these
pallets no we absolutely don't but what
you need may be different than what I
need which might be different what she
needs and what he needs over there so
I'm gonna give you the rundown all four
of these pallets so you can decide for
yourself what you need so let's go ahead
and start with the first one that was
released which was the Too Faced
chocolate bar palette now as you may
have already noticed I do not own the
Too Faced semi-sweet palette I decided
to pass on that one I heard kind of some
mixed reviews on it and it was just one
that I just decided to pass on so I did
but I did get this one now let's give
you the rundown on this you get 16
shadows of that you do have some matte
shades we have salted caramel here white
chocolate semi-sweet milk chocolate and
triple fudge those are your matte shades
now you notice right away you have lots
of different shades of brown in your
matte shades so what that tells me is
the Too Faced was thinking of people
with lots of different skin tones trying
to appeal to a lot of different people
when they created this palette which is
pretty awesome
now what a lot of people use matte
shades for is for a transition shape now
a transition shade will go up into your
crease to help you transition your
colors from one to another it can also
create a contour in your crease to kind
of make your eyes pop when you choose a
transition color it's typically a
the shades darker than your natural skin
tone so they've taken to a consideration
a lot of skin tones with these matte
shades which is pretty awesome
you also notice that you've got some
lighter shades there is one more matte
shade that they didn't mention which is
called strawberry bonbon that can also
be used as a really nice matte lid color
now let's talk about the variety the
shadows in here you got a lot of Brown
it's a lot of Brown happening in here
you don't have a whole lot of color so
we've got a little bit of purple here
and candied violet a little bit of kind
of a forest green over here and gilding
ganache a little bit of black forest
truffle and cherry cordial but overall
we got Browns really standout shade in
here is creme brulee this one is
absolutely gorgeous it's a gold with a
little bit of a pink shift very unique
amazing color if this shade calls to you
this may be the palette for you this one
definitely calls to me another one
that's a fantastic shade is marzipan
it's kind of a rose gold color
absolutely beautiful now shades don't
work for me candied violet is probably
one of my least favorite shades and all
of the palettes from Too Faced that I
have it goes on grey for me I can't get
it to show up purple no matter how hard
I try no matter what I put down
it comes out grey for me so that's a
shade that doesn't work for me but
overall so really great palette another
page that I really like a champagne
truffle it's like a white with a little
bit of a pink shift it's really pretty
we've got a really nice brow bone
highlight for a lot of different skin
tones really nice inner corner highlight
a really like white chocolate a lot it's
just a really nice solid Brown neutrally
shade palette it's not super creative
except for maybe creme brulee but it's a
good solid palette this is a great
palette for beginners because it's it's
really pretty error proof you know you
watch one tutorial and you're probably
going to be able to do something good
with this so definitely a great one for
beginners people who have a big
collection may not find a lot of
uniqueness in this one but I personally
really really love it since I don't have
a semi-sweet next one we're going to be
talking about is the Too Faced chocolate
bonbons pal this one also smells like
chocolate it really has
the set both of them kind of like a like
a hot chocolate you know when you open
up a pack of hot chocolate that's what
it smells like to me it smells really
really nice so this one also has 16
shades your matte shades in here are
almond truffle pecan praline Bordeaux
mocha and divinity now you have a little
bit of a satin finish in cashew chew
you've got that interesting thing that
two-face does in malted where they give
you kind of a mattes shade and then they
throw some glitter in there so this one
is kind of a matte Brown but it's got
some gold glitter in there with makes it
really unique very finely milled gold
glitter so I don't usually get typically
get a lot of fallout with the glitter on
these shades which makes me super duper
uber happy now one thing you'll notice
if you look at the chocolate bonbons
versus the original choc bar palette if
I can find it there is is that this one
tends to be a lot cooler than the
original chocolate bar palette so if you
like a little bit more warm tones you'll
probably like the original better than
the bonbons if you like cooler tones
you'll probably like the bonbons better
now on my eyes today I have all shades
from the bon bons palette I have black
currant in the center
I have cafe au lait in the inner corner
I have
almond truffle up in my crease and I've
also used used malted to kind of deepen
out my my outer corner I've used
divinity as a brow bone blending shade
and I really like this palette a lot
it's a pretty new purchase for me but
people in the community are raving about
this and I just had to get it I was on
periscope during the vib Rouge sale and
I wasn't supposed to be on periscope so
I was kind of hiding my phone a little
bit and I'm watching as I'm walking past
to face the nice you know they can all
see Too Faced going by on the screen and
all I see is bon mots bon bons bon bons
bon bons going up in the end the chat in
the window it's a live streaming at
periscope so everyone's typing in
bonbons Baba's Jen get the bonbons get
the bonbon so I got the bonbons and I'm
really thankful the community never
steers me wrong I mean when everybody
has a general consensus about something
good I know I'm on a good path and
that's basically what happened with the
bonbons it's a fantastic palette you
have a nice range of shades here you've
got a few more colors in this pink this
pink this purple then you do in the
original chocolate bar palette it's a
little bit more creative of a color
selection but I mean is it a must-have
palette I don't know it depends on what
you already have but if you this cost
you I would definitely recommend it it's
fantastic palette now moving onto the
palettes that were released this spring
/summer
from Too Faced so we got the Too Faced
peanut butter and jelly palette I've
really mixed feelings about this so like
if we were talking about like your best
friends like friends that you just love
and you're like yes I love them like
that would be these palettes this would
be the friend that you like hang out
with everyone smile and they're really
cool people but they're not like your
people you know like there's really
they're nice people but they're not your
people that's the way I feel about this
now the biggest complaint that I have
about this the lot you will have but
this is there's just not enough jelly in
this palette not enough jelly
we have jamon and we have jelly as our
two jelly shades everything else is very
peanut butter now jam and jelly both
have issues jamming goes on beautifully
but it doesn't stay on my lids at all
jelly you have to pack on your lids and
work with it and work with it to get it
to work but it lasts forever so they
both have their
issues now the rest of the shades are
really nice we've got a few matte shades
I'd like to mention the matte shades all
the rest of these shades are shimmer you
have extra creamy you have nuts about
you and you have peanut butter as your
matte shades now you notice that the
transition shades are gone a week I mean
you got peanut butter it's kind of a
possible transition nuts about you if
got a really warm skin tone maybe I
don't use nuts about you as a transition
it's a little too wild for me for a
transition you've got one of those matte
with the glitter things in here with the
spread the love
it is a peach shade with a little bit of
gold glitter in a very light yellow gold
glitter the standout shades for me here
are bananas which is a wonderful shade
and peanut butter cup those are the ones
that I found that perform the best if
you have a deeper skin tone you'll
notice there aren't a lot of really deep
shades in here so you may have to reach
for another palette even if you have any
skin tone you may want to reach for
another palette if you want to deepen up
your look I mean you don't have a lot of
options here except for jamming and
about five hours and your look Jam it's
going to be gone at least from my
experience so you probably want to reach
for another palette in order to hairs
going in my lipstick you might probably
want to reach for another palette in
order to deepen up the look but for a
nice basic everyday palette it's pretty
nice I like it it's before the scent it
smells like Reese's Pieces to me which
is like a sugary peanut butter scent it
also has a little hint of a chocolate
scent to it
but mostly I smell sugary peanut butter
candy is what I smell when I smell this
and it's very nice not the best very
nice coming to the very last palette
which is the one that most recently came
out this is the sweet peach palette now
everybody that's been on the internet on
Instagram on YouTube and is following
this you know the craziness that
happened with this and the release
everybody's going nuts over it it's
really hard for them to even keep it in
stock anyone anywhere everyone's going
crazy because of all of the pre-launch
hype over it pictures on Instagram it
was sent to a bunch of beauty vloggers
and everybody did looks with it and that
made everybody drool over it as soon as
we all heard that it smelled like peach
rings everybody was like yes beige rings
like I don't know what's up with that
like it like it smells like Canyon we
just like
have to have it I don't know even though
we're not eating it even though some
people have eaten it and I won't admit
that I've eaten it but I could say if I
did try to taste this eyeshadow palette
I would say it tastes like peach
flavored Pixy Stix but I'm not admitting
anything you've got some matte shades in
here of course I got to mention them we
have peaches and cream
Georgia puree some are young and charmed
I'm sure so you've noticed that just
like the original chocolate bar palette
we have a wide range of shades that
people could use for transition colors
which is a big thumbs up you've also got
one of those shades that I talked to you
about it's kind of a matte with that
glitter in there in this candied peach
now this is the thing my friend Murali
who is a beautiful golden latina you
know nice warm tan skin tone this didn't
show up on her at all when she got it
before I did I was watching her swatch
on periscope and I was like oh no
because it just wasn't showing up on her
I was like what is going on no way now
since then she's she's like I think she
likes it a little bit more but still on
her medium skin tone she's not really
showing up well which is really
disappointing to me for me it's a little
difficult to work with as far as the way
the shades blend together but my friend
Nikki six five four three this is why I
love my community I will link all of
Nikki stuff down below now Nikki
mentioned that if you put peaches and
cream and Georgia one or the other or a
combination of both down first before
you lay any of these colors on top
they're a lot easier to work with but do
you want to go through all of that when
you pay this much for a pellet that's up
to you but it will work at least on my
lids it works it works on Nikki's lids
to stand out shades in this palette are
nectar and luscious
they are also another one I'm really
enjoying is candy peach very much
enjoying that I love this formula that
they've done with the mat with the
glitter in it
most of those really work well for me no
huge misses in here of shades that I
just can't get to work except for just
peachy just peachy seems to be kind of a
fail for me it just doesn't really give
this color like I want it to be this and
it's just not this you know also I found
that talked Derby to me is a little bit
difficult
to work with this palette if I you know
I said my best friends then you got your
people that you really like hanging out
with but just not everyday you know this
is the palette of your acquaintance you
know someone that you see and you like
them but they're not someone that you
call on the phone and want to hang out
with you know it's it's okay it's fine
and I think and see why a lot of people
will really enjoy it but I personally
don't think in my opinion you should
flip out and run out and get this unless
you want for the novelty of it the sense
of it as a collector's item then
definitely go and get it because it is
fun to use on occasion but I can see
this palette is not one that I'm
personally going to reach for a lot I
like the other ones better so the other
thing that I wanted to say though about
this is if you're a color lover this is
going to be one that you're going to
reach for more than the others it
definitely has a lot more options as far
as colors you've got green you got
purple you got peach and people complain
there's not a lot of peach in here I
personally see a lot of peach maybe it's
just my interpretation of what peach is
but just peachy it's like a pinky peach
and then you've got Bellini which is
kind of a peach it's kind of a weird
color though doesn't really work that
great candy peach Georgia peaches and
cream nectar summer yum is even edging
on a deep peach you know but I mean even
puree is edging on a deep peach you know
when you think about like the pit of the
peach you know I really feel like this
has plenty of peach in it I don't know I
mean true peach you got candied peach
you got nectar but they're definitely
edging on the edge of peach if they put
too much peach in your girlfriend you
would been complaining there's too much
peach in here and you can't work with it
because they all muddy together so they
did shades of peach variations of peach
I get it I get it I just wish that they
had spent a little bit more time on the
quality of the shadows I feel like it
kind of falls short just a little bit so
