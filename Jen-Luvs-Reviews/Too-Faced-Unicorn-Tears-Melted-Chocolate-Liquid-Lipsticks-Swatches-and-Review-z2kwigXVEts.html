hello my friends welcome to my two-faced
spring line review I don't have
everything of course in the line because
that would be like a thousand dollars
but I picked a few things from the new
to feast line that I wanted to review
for you of course I could not resist the
melted chocolate liquify long-wear
lipsticks I have tried a few of these in
the not chocolate version they were ok
they kind of flaked a little bit on me
like I wasn't like a hundred percent
impress with them I didn't dislike them
but I felt like they needed a little bit
of love in order to work for me also I
wasn't a huge fan of the shade rage that
was just me personally from my personal
taste in lip products but I wanted to
get some of these because the chocolate
sold me the chocolate sold me that's
what it comes down to I also got one of
their a new la creme lipsticks this is
my favorite lipstick formula i got it in
sugar daddy and then i got no no no
unicorn tears yes i got it i got it
and when i first put this on my lips I
thought it looked insane like absolutely
in sane I was like no way no this is not
this is never going on my lips ever I do
have it on my lips right now I want to
show you how this unicorn tears works
and why I am now in love with it and I
give all the credit to my friends on
periscope for teaching me and telling me
the love that I could give to unicorn
tears I did I had no idea so what we're
going to do now is we're going to go
ahead and we're going to do lip swatches
of the liquid lipsticks we're also going
to do a lip swatch of sugar-daddy and
then I'm going to show you what it looks
like with unicorn tears over top now
what I'm wearing right now is chocolate
honey with unicorn tears over top but I
want to show you what chocolate honey
looks like without the
years
so those were the swatches using these
lipsticks as different combinations so
what I've kind of learned about these is
number one they do smell like chocolate
but they it's in a similar family to the
chocolate bar palette but add on like a
less creamy a little more plasticky kind
of scent that bothers you you probably
won't like these the scent is strong you
can smell it on your lips but if you do
don't mind like imagine like a chocolate
lip balm it smells kind of artificial
but I personally don't mind it I
actually quite enjoy it just you need to
decide whether that's right for you the
other thing is is after I've worn these
for about 30 minutes they do dry out so
when I use something like unicorn tears
on top it definitely keeps it hydrated
so that it doesn't feel like it's
drawing out my lip so that's really
really nice the other thing that I've
noticed is more I put on more swatches
the more glitter got all over my face
these do not have shimmer in them they
have well they might have shimmer but
they also have glitter like straight
glitter specks of glow like like pieces
of glitter so just be aware that that is
there and definitely keep if you're
wiping it off or if you're eating or
something make sure and you know you
wipe your mouth with a napkin
you just have to hair my face you just
have to make sure that you are aware of
the glitter and kind of keep your eye on
that because that would just be weird to
be like sitting eating at dinner and
then end up with glitter like all over
your chin it would just be odd so just
be careful with that it's the same thing
with the metallic chocolate diamonds I
wouldn't even say this is really super
metallic let me swatch it on my hand I
mean I guess it is metallic but it's
very glittery it's got a lot of straight
glitter in it I guess it's metallic too
but it's very sheer on its own I would
say this is more of a regular lip
product with glitter in it silver
glitter so just be aware of that I do
kind of like this as a topper I think it
would be nice as like an evening out the
other thing I want to just mention about
the swatches if you allow these to drive
or you put unicorn tears on the shimmer
and the glitter and the glow will be
intensified so be aware of that if you
really like the intensified look
definitely let them dry before you apply
unicorn tears so that's my review of the
new toothpaste lipstick again this is my
favorite lipstick formula of all time I
really really love the lipsticks I do
feel like they've improved on the liquid
lipstick formula I don't feel like it's
as drying as flaking as the older ones
that I have I have peony and I think I
have one other one and I wasn't that big
of a fan of that formula I do feel like
they've improved on it a bit they did
the chocolate scent but you definitely
have to enjoy a fake chocolate scent in
order to enjoy these don't expect it to
smell just like the chocolate bar
palette there is a small variation in
its less creamy and it's a little more
plasticky but overall these are huge
wins for me I'm really enjoying them
probably my least favourite thing is
probably the metallic chocolate diamonds
because I think that it's the least
wearable and my favorite thing very
surprisingly is unicorn tears I am
shocked at how much I like this
absolutely shocked but I really thought
this is gonna get thrown in a drawer

friends on periscope who joined me with
