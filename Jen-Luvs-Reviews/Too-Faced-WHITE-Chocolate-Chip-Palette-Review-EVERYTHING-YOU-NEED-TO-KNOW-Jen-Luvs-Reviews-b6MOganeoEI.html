the two-faced white chocolate chip
palette this is a little mini palette
that came out a very very limited
edition no I wasn't planning on getting
this and then I looked at and I went
pretty colors and it's chocolate and I
want it and it's I know is I'm being
tricked by marketing but I'm gonna buy
it anyway I just I had to I just I there
was something calling me to this palette
that made me want to buy it so I did and
now I'm going to review it for you
before I get into the review I've been
being asked a lot lately what else is on
my face so just very quickly my
foundation today is the elf moisturizing
foundation stick I don't believe this is
available anymore if it is it's very
limited quantities very limited shades
I've seen it on Ulta here and there it's
a really really great foundation I'm in
love with it this is not a review of
this foundation Jen I'm just so mad they
discontinued it this is the Tarte shape
tape in the shade light oh and this is
in the shade natural by the way then for
blush I'm trying out some indie brand so
the blush I'm using is by Eldridge
organics and it's autumn spice and it's
actually only made out of herbs and
spices which i think is really super
cool for highlight I'm wearing the
essence pure nude highlighter in it be
my highlight for bronzer I have the
Physicians Formula butter bronzer and
for contour the NYX professional makeup
love contours all palette the lightest
shade of bronzer and lastly for lips
another indie brand it's called
addictive cosmetics I have their natural
anywhere liner all over my lips in the
shade torrid and then I've topped that
with their ice queen lip junkie is what
it's called that's the shine you're
seeing this is more of like a stain and
this is like a shine but I'm working on
a review of this stuff the nd stuff so
that's coming soon these work I got off
these off Etsy I'm doing like a whole
little Etsy video that I'm working on
that I'm really excited about
anyway enough about what else is on my
face let's get into talking about this
chocolate chip palette now as usual if
you're used to my review videos I pack a
lot of information so definitely make
sure you go to the skip
had buttons down below if you want to
skip ahead to a specific portion of the
video so first thing we're going to talk
about is that this was extremely limited
edition it was sold at sephora.com
it was only available for maybe an hour
so before it's sold out they are talking
about bringing this back it does say on
the Sephora website it's still there and
it says email me when available so you
can always sign up for the email
notification at Sephora if you are
interested in purchasing this palette
but it's currently unavailable I did
hear a rumor that it will be back in the
spring but I don't know if that's true
or not the packaging is made out of
plastic which this is the first time I
personally have seen a two-phase palette
made out of actual plastic usually
they're made out of some kind of tin for
example this is the peanut butter and
jelly palette you can see the size
difference as far as like the thickness
of it and the size of it and then if you
look at let's say the chocolate bar
palette you can see it's the same kind
of material and then this is the plastic
these older smaller palettes that used
to make out of cardboard they were this
like flip-up cardboard size but they
were still about the same size as let's
say like the sugar pop palette or the
peanut butter and jelly palette they
were about the same size so this to my
knowledge is the smallest eyeshadow
palette that two-face has ever made
inside the palette you have your shadows
you have your mirror that takes up the
full top of the palette and then on the
back you have all of your shade names
there are 11 eyeshadows in this 10 of
the shadows the smaller ones are 0.5
grams each the top one this longer one
is 1.5 grams so that ends up being six
point five grams total of product in
here it is a $26 I shadow palette which
comes out to $4 per gram of product I
took some notes on some other very
popular products so for example the Too
Faced chocolate bar palette breaks down
to two dollars and 79 cents per gram of
product the Urban Decay Naked palette is
$3 and $0.19 per gram of product Kat Von
D metal matte is the cheapest that I've
ever seen at a Sephora price which was a
dollar sixty per gram of product and the
anasazi of beverly hills Modern
Renaissance palette actually even though
it's cheaper than some of these other
palettes it actually breaks down to
$5.25 per gram of products so it's
actually more per gram than this
here so this is a very expensive pallet
when you talk about price per gram a
product that you're getting but of
course it is a more inexpensive product
at $26 compared to let's say $50 $45 for
some of the other palettes I'm talking
about other details about this product
it is made in the United States but it
is manufactured in the Dominican
Republic to face claims to be cruelty
free but now there's all of this drama
and that two-faced is now sold to Estee
Lauder and their parent company Estee
Lauder is not cruelty free so money
eventually trickles up to Estee Lauder
which is not a cruelty-free company even
though this product was not tested on
animals it is gluten-free it's
formulated without parabens sulfates or
phthalates it is not vegan due to
carmine and also possibly the
ultramarines which can be plant-based or
animal-based we just don't know so now
that we've gone into the details of this
product let's go ahead and show you the
swatches I'm going to show you finger
swatches and brush swatches here they
come
you will go at each other lap we'll go
with you I do not go rough we keep
throwing things and slamming the door
keeping a get so damn dysfunctional and
Stocking Minsk or I get sick and
although we can't do this no more oh
baby they go again they go again making
me love you yeah I stopped using my head
using my head let it all go
I got you stuck my body my body like a
tattoo and now I'm feeling stupid
feeling stupid crawling back to you so
across my
and I hope to die that I'll only stay
with you one more night
I said it
I ain't I
but I only stay with you one more night
try to tell you no but my body keeps on
telling you yeah try to tell you stop
but your lipstick come in so a depressed
I'll be waking up in the morning
probably eating myself I'll be waking up
feeling satisfied but guilty yeah baby
there you go again there you go again
making me love you yeah I stopped using
my head using my head let it all go
I got you stuck on my body my body like
a tattoo and now I'm feeling stupid
feeling stupid crawling back to you so
now you have seen the swatches from the
palette and I'm now going to show you
how I got this look using one on this
look but this look using this only this
eyeshadow palette I can tell you it is
quite a challenge to get a variety of
looks out of his eyeshadow palette we're
gonna get into more about that with the
review that's coming up after the
ingredient analysis which is coming up
after the demo so we'll see you in just
a minute
take me a long drive it engine burning
fingers
every time
it's been a while since I have even
heard from you from you I should just
say Italy you can I know exactly really
is that what's go round and round each
time do you got that
Oh
we never go out
long hair
and you look like your
- I
crash
we never go out
Oh
I can't keep my legs up she's taking
nothing you say Oh her did you've been
on about with some body girl somebody
girl
say what you were too but I can't stop
thinking about you Anna I set up in
there two of you time did you guess you
enjoyed the demo now we're going to go
ahead into ingredient analysis this is
where I go to ewg orga environmental
working group and other sources that I
happen to trust and love and find out
about the ingredients that are contained
in this palette to see whether they are
harmful for you or maybe people with
specific skin types and you know what to
be aware of so let's go ahead and jump
into that the first thing is that every
single almost every single shadow in
here is a different formula the
exceptions are cookie dough and cake
batter are the same formula but other
than that they are all different
formulas in here the red flag
ingredients that come up in this are
ones that are very very common and many
of my other videos if you've seen my
ingredients before you're going to
recognize these names talc xfo palmitate
phenoxyethanol and ultramarines let me
just give you a quick rundown of the
ones that I talk about often first one
is talc it is a bulking agent so
basically they have a bunch of pigments
they have to use something to make the
pigment stick to something to make there
be more product to make it more usable
you probably wouldn't want to put a
straight pigment on your eyes you've got
to kind of buffer it with something it's
like taking a shot of straight vodka or
mixing it with something else you most
likely are going to want to mix it
unless you're hardcore like that some
people are very allergic to talc so be
aware of that talk is in every single
one of these eyeshadows also there is
some concern with the lack of research
that people have done on talc I will
link some some links down below to
different articles you can read about
tell the next one is phenoxyethanol
which is a preservative
does have an irritation concern for the
skin and eyes the next one is very
common is the at the hexyl palmitate
there is some evidence that it is an
irritant one of the community members
her name is Carolyn her sister is highly
allergic to ethnic slur palmitate so
there are people that are alerted to it
is a replacement for silicone so it
gives it that slip that wetness that
that um you know the the softness that
you feel on a shadow when you say that
it's buttery
that's the ephah hexyl palmitate if you
haven't ever been alerted to eyeshadows
in the past
it probably won't bother you along with
the phenoxyethanol will probably not
bother you if i shudders have never
bothered you in the past but if they
have bothered you in the past you may
want to check and see if those
ingredients are in them because it's in
pretty much every eyeshadow the last
couple of reviews I did the Kat Von D
metal matte the Too Faced not to face
the Tarte Pro palette that both has both
of those ingredients in them the next
one is one that I kind of found by
accident I ex the only search port what
I meant to search for something else and
I found something really interesting
this is sodium d hydro acetate it's
actually labeled as a one on
Environmental Working Group but also I
wanted to let you know that it does have
workplace exposure restricted to low
doses and the European Union and it is
classified as toxic or harmful only
products used around the mouth and the
lips so you don't want to put some of
these eyeshadows on your lips that's for
the European Union it's but then Canada
says it's classified not expected to be
protect potentially toxic or harmful so
people in Canada whatever research they
looked at they said it was fine people
in the European Union said that it's not
fine don't put it on your lips the next
one is another preservative called
sorbic acid there are data gaps for
sorbic acid for organ system toxicity so
basically being harmful to your organs
non reproductive organs they have found
evidence that is a human skin toxin or
allergen there is strong evidence for
that for the cosmetic ingredient review
assessments which is based in the United
States and also but then again this is
very interesting Canada says if it's
classified is not expected to be
potentially toxic or harmful so in
Canada they say that it's fine in the US
they say that it can be toxic or harmful
we just don't know how much you would
need in order for it to be harmful it is
rated as a three by ewg just so you know
that is in here
the next one I think is really really
interesting and they've actually removed
this ingredient from the Anasazi of
Beverly Hills modern renaissance proud
but they put it in the old Anasazi
appellate this is something called PTFE
which is actually teflon if you know
teflon I know I'm like waving this
palette around but I just feel like I
need to express myself and it's like you
know it's like shhh so Teflon is you
know you put it on your pans and it
makes that non-stick coating and it was
all this thing a big thing about cancer
and when you heated the pan up to a
certain degrees it you know you didn't
want that Teflon cooking into your food
that's the big concern with Teflon it's
really not a huge concern for things
like eye shadow because you're not
heating up your eyeshadow but
Environmental Working Group does say
that it's a five on their radar so
that's why I wanted to mention it there
are a couple other ones on here they're
the colorant so we have aluminum powder
which is rated a four to nine it is a
known human nervous system toxicant
toxic Kent yes toxic and but again it's
one of those things where you're really
going to need it in a high concentration
you're not going to find it in a high
concentration in the size shadow palette
it is FDA approved and the FDA says that
it may see safely be used in coloring
externally applied cosmetics including
cosmetics intended for use in the eye
area ultramarines is the next one it's
also a colorant the pigments like I said
earlier when we're talking about whether
it was vegan or not candy animal drive
but they could also be plants arrived or
they can be from synthetic sources it is
restricted in cosmetics use
concentration or manufacturing
restrictions only for products on the
lips by the FDA so again don't put it on
your lips and then the last one is
something called CI one nine one four
zero which is another color and it's
called yellow five Lake and it's rated
as a three there are some high concerns
for persistence and bioaccumulation but
this is one of those things again we
don't know how much it takes to bio
accumulate or build up in your system in
order for it to be harmful there's also
some moderate concerns for organ system
toxicity again non-reproductive
it is restricted in cosmetics for use
and manufacturing restrictions by
coasting which is in the European Union
the Environment Canada domestic
substance list has data gaps they say
that they found studies were totally bad
and then studies where it's fine and
then
the things we're studies were it's
really bad and things that are fine both
for the bioaccumulation and for being
toxic or harmful so you know it's one of
those things where we just don't know
there isn't enough information on it but
as of now they're allowed to put it in
eyeshadow if it bothers you don't buy
this so this one is definitely not as
clean as the last two palettes that I
reviewed the Tarte Pro and the Kat Von D
metal matte this one definitely has some
other ingredients that may cause concern
in some people one thing I do want to
mention before we move on to my full
review is that this does include cocoa
powder which is in all of the chocolate
bar pellets but it also includes
something called vanilla which is a
synthetic vanilla and that is what gives
this a white chocolate chip smell it
really does it smells amazing it's got
the same chocolate bar scent but then
it's got that little bit of vanilla and
it smells wonderful if you do own the
tarte Pro palette they do use vanilla
but also vanilla extract in the Tarte
Pro palette so imagine kind of as you
know the chocolate bar palette smell and
the tart you know in bloom or the Tarte
Pro palette had a baby the smell would
be in here and it does smell really
really really good so now that all that
geeky stuff is over let's get into my
full review of this palette so I've got
some positives believe it or not and
I've also got some negatives let's start
with the negatives because that's kind
of the pink elephant in the room where
we just can't avoid the negatives with
this palette the first negative is the
size of course it is very small but like
my friend Vicky who's in the community
she said you know it's sometimes nice to
have smaller palettes because you can
hit pan faster you can if you get tired
of them you can move them out of your
collection faster and it's nice to be
able to put them in your in your purse
for travel or if you're you know going
on a weekend and you want to put it in
your you know in your bag and take it
for travel you can do that
the clasp here is very very very strong
I don't see it opening up very easily
you may want to just to be sure put it
in a ziplock sandwich baggie because it
will fit in there it'll put it in there
to make sure that it doesn't open up and
travel but it is nice for that you know
to be able to take it with you but what
I don't recommend for travel is the
shade selection the shade selection is
atrocious and that's valid it's so bad
it's probably the worst shade selection
I've ever seen in an eyeshadow palette
it's like what do I even do with this
what do you do I mean it's when you
swatch them if you noticed in the
swatches that you've got light light
light light light light like nine times
and then you have black it's like what
were they thinking I just don't get it
like I am shocked that I can even use
this shade here as a transition color
I'm shocked but there's nothing in
between like it's like I there's nothing
else to do why in the world they put
these two matte peachy tan shades in
there and not a deeper Brown I have no
idea I want to shake Jared right now
like what are you thinking like Jared
call me I will help you with stuff like
this trust me I will help you this is
not this is not good this is not a good
idea um and even there like if you are a
woman of color you are gonna you're
gonna be really upset because it's one
of those things like my friend Tina
Marie did a wonderful review on this
palette and she was so frustrated so
fresh I'll put a little clip of Tina in
her review here and you could just see
like her eyes are like a diamond I mean
they're just like shiny white and
there's nothing else she can do there's
no variety in here there's no way to get
multiple looks out of this palette
you're gonna have exactly what I did
today and the thing is is even between
these two shades here this one here is
sugared raisin and this one is indulge
they on the eye they really don't look
that different and the same thing with
like these shimmery shades they really
don't look that different on the eye so
it's going to be very slight variations
on the exact same theme and it's just a
boring expletive deleted palette and
when you look at it it's beautiful but
when you think about it practically it's
just not functional even for
light-skinned people it's just not a
functional shade selection um you know I
mean even mixing this with other
palettes there's it there's no point in
it there's really no I don't know I
don't know what I was thinking because
when I looked at this palette online I
knew exactly what I was getting but I
don't know why I still got sucked
do it and I should know better feel like
I'm a relatively intelligent person and
I should know better but if just I
didn't I got sucked in and I bought it
anyway the other thing is that I want to
mention is if you have the chocolate
shop palette that was the Sephora
release do not buy this because five out
of the eleven shades are in the
chocolate bar palette I'll show you
which ones I was reading the back after
I was watching Tina Ray's video I was
weren't reading the back I was like
those shades sound awfully familiar and
I was like five of these shades are in
the chocolate shop are you kidding me
okay so we have indulge guilt-free cake
batter cookie dough and sugar Drazen are
all in the chocolate shop palette
woah woah oh I don't I feel duped it's
like I totally feel Duke you know and
it's just like are you kidding me are
you kidding me and then the other thing
is is these two shades right here
indulge in sugar Drazen could be
beautiful but the fallout is insane if
you can manage somehow to not get fallen
on your face when you're applying by the
end of the day you are going to have
fallout on your face you're going to
have glitter all over and it happens
I've worn this palette now three times
this is the fourth time I put it on and
every time I've tried to use these
shades I've had literally there was one
time I did not use these this one
actually also has glitter fall at this
one pearl candy has glitter fallout but
I did use a dual look with kind of these
in here like the Matt Moore maddest ones
I put the pink all over my lid I did not
have glitter fall up from there but that
being said I do have a positive my
positive is is that the lasting power on
these eyeshadows is very very very good
I have to tell you I have to be honest
the lasting power is great by the end of
the day I stopped separation of color
you can still see significant you know
color like you can tell what was going
on when I first started and I do enjoy
that about this palette but there's so
much I don't enjoy I cannot recommend
this palette to you it's just not worth
the money for anybody of any skin tone
unless you just want to stock up on
light shades if you have
no light shade in your collection and
you just want light shades or if you are
a collector of two-faced and you want
this as part of your collection there is
also a I guess I don't think it called
the dark chocolate chip I think it's
just called the chocolate chip palette
that was available exclusively on the
two-faced website again I don't know
what that if that's going to be
available again that one does have all
matte shades and it seems to be a little
bit more friendly as far as the shade
variation in there it looked boring to
me in that I already own the chocolate
bar palette I already own the bon bons
palette so I didn't feel the need to
purchase that one like I did this one
because this one did look unique and I
appreciate Too Faced we're trying to be
a little more unique but little tweaks
and this could have been a fantastic
palette little tweaks like I said Jared
call me I will help you I will help you
if you need help because this is not
okay if it's not good you miss the mark
I'm sorry I love you but you missed the
mark I want to thank you so much for
watching this video if you enjoyed it
definitely make sure that you subscribe
to the channel hit the little bell if
you want to be notified when I make new
videos share this video with a friend
