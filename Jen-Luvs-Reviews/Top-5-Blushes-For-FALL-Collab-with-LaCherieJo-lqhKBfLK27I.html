doing a collaboration today with my
friend Jocelyn over at last Cherie Joe
she does fantastic reviews she does
homes and tutorials and all kinds of
stuff she is absolutely adorable I'm
gonna put her video you probably are
seeing that right now right there so you
can see just how cute she is and why you
should go over to her channel if you're
coming over from Jocelyn's channel
welcome hi I'm Jen I do reviews as the
name says and the collab that we are
doing is our top five rushes for a fall
so the first one that I want to talk
about is my Sephora cream blush I feel
like I've got heroin out I did yeah the
first one I want to tell you about is my
Sephora cream blush and if you've been a
subscriber mine for a while you'll know
that this is one of my favorites and
this is it Rose glow and it is just
beautiful and this for a cream blush has
extremely long lasting power there is
the finger swatch and then here is the
hands wash it is so creamy if you have
oily skin you might want to watch out
for this one though because it does have
a little bit of an oily base to it but
if you have normal or dry skin I don't
notice it and let me kind of blend that
out a little bit for you so you can kind
of see how that blend out and it's just
gorgeous for pho it's like a maulvi pink
and just absolutely beautiful next up we
have down boy by the bone now this one I
you know I like it for fall but I like
it for spring too i like it for pretty
much any season it's just a beautiful
natural blush on it's very pink toned
and i will show you what that looks like
there is the finger swatch and i will
put that here
what that looks like and i'll blend it
out a little bit and kind of see what
that looks like and it just really gives
like a natural pinky flush to the skin I
really love that one this one might not
look as good on darker skin tones this
is more like for a lighter skin tone so
probably with Ashley on darker skin
tones last up for high end is my tart
blush in tipsy now this is another one
that can be either spring or fall but I
honestly what I like to do with this one
for a fall there's the finger swatch I'm
going to do a double swatch just so you
can really see the pigmentation and then
what I like to do is I like to put a
bronzer over top of it so i have this
NYX blush it's called a blush but it's
in cocoa so it's kind of a bronzer and
then I'll take that and I'll put that
over top and it'll kind of make it into
like a burnt orange and I love it and
that's actually what I'm wearing today I
don't know if you can tell I don't like
to overload the blush but I feel like on
camera kind of need to overload the
blush so you can see it and you know if
you were standing right here right now
right here right now that's a terrible
rendition of that song there's a reason
why I don't sing if you were standing
right here you would see you know that
I've got blush on but yeah I just love
the combo of those two together so I'm
not counting this one as one of my top
five blushes because I kind of use it as
a combo I'm going to put that over the
other one too so you can see how that
kind of changes it into like em all this
down boy I'm just kind of a way to kind
of fall up your spring blushes so on to
drugstore I have to drugstore ones and
honestly like I absolutely love next
blushes I always try to catch these
sometimes they will have forty percent
of sales at Ulta sometimes they'll have
big sales on the next website and
whenever I know about those i always put
them on my facebook page so if you're
not friends with me on facebook make
sure you click the link below to go to
my facebook page it's just jen lowes
reviews on facebook so anyway so this
one is in desert rose and it is my
absolute favorite full blush look at
that it's like a bright pink but when
you shear it out when you kind of blend
it in I mean just gorgeous gorgeous
gorgeous color for fall fine
really this is actually a recent
discovery these wet and wild color icons
I was just really late to the game on
these I don't know why these I would
honestly say well both these the next
formula and the wet and wild formula are
just as good as the bomb ones so the
reason why I think they call this
pearlescent pink is because it does have
some sparkle in it so if you're not into
sparkly blushes you don't want this one
but just the pigmentation of the stuff
is just amazing I mean look at that very
similar to the down boy next to each
other they don't look this similar the
down boys a lot pickier but now that
I've added that bronzer on top can't
really tell but yeah just absolutely
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous and
I feel like this one would work better
on darker skin than the than the down
boy so those are my top 5 blushes for
fall I hope that you found something
that you would like to try and enjoy
trying to put a kind of a wide range of
ideas and really just the use of a
bronzer can really change the entire
look of your spring blush into a fall
blush so keep that in mind and it
doesn't have to be this one of course it
can be any whichever of your favorite
bronzers that you like as long as it is
a brown hood bronzer and not an orange
tone bronze because i feel like the
orange tone bronzers on top of a blush
it doesn't really work so you want to
make sure that it is a deeper color
