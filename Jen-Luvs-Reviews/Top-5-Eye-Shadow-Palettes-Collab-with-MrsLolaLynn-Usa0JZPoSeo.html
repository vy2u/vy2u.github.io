was almost 10 welcome to my top five
pallets of all time this video is a
collaboration with my friend Laura over
at mrs. Lowell in I know a lot of my
subscribers already watch her because I
see you commenting on her videos and
you're the same people to comment on my
videos so you already know where but if
you don't you are missing out laura is
amazing she is beautiful her makeup
application is flawless and this girl
can buy some makeup let me tell you she
has a collection to die for if you're
coming here from Laura's channel hi I'm
Jen I do a lot of reviews here are my
top 5 pallets now I thought about
starting off with like this or this but
I think that that's kind of boring so
I'm going to go in order from my like
number five all the way to number one
we're going to talk about Nick's I
shadows now I have this NYX it is the
box of eyeshadows it's 112 colors I
don't think this one is available
anymore but i think that the formulas in
these are pretty true to the large
knicks boxes that you can get now there
are a ton of these nyx is always coming
out with new ones different themes
things like that and every next palette
that ever swatch is very similar to that
with this one we're going to have hits
and you're going to have some misses now
this one in particular came with all of
these shades and then you open up the
bottom drawer and then all of your
brights are in the bottom now the reason
why I want to include this in my
favorites is because it's got everything
that I need if I can't get a an
eyeshadow in a palette that I'm using or
if I'm using single shadows I know I can
reach for this and find exactly what I'm
looking for so picking up one of these
or something from like bh cosmetics or
you know those companies just a 88 color
palette something that is really really
nice to have in case of emergency i mean
you have that random occasion where you
want to wear something like this
and you've got it okay look let's say
you're going to a sports game where
you're looking for a specific color
where you're going to an event where
there's a theme or color or something
you're trying to go with it's nice to
have a palette like this even though it
might not be for everyday wear it may
not be something you're going to reach
for all the time it's really nice to
have this variety as a backup now this
naked man is amazing he saves me all the
time look if I just need a good matte
shadow to like calm down my look or if I
am using a palette that doesn't have
like a good witch called like a good
transition color or if a it doesn't have
a good brow bone color I reach from Matt
and Matt hooks me up now here are the
colors the shadows and here are gigantic
I'm one of the things on here is it says
size matters hahaha just to kind of give
you a sampling of what this looks like
I've sweat switched i swatched Matt
Johnson Matt Garcia and that mold away
on my hand for you so you can see how
pigmented they are but what I love about
these is how blendable they are I mean
you really you can you can fit these
into any kind of I love especially if
you've got something that you just want
me to calm down a little bit it's too
glittery you need to kind of mattify it
a little bit Matt will hook you up
girlfriend are you seriously playing my
support favorites get you realize that
$75 yeah yeah you do mmm-hmm the next
one I want to show you is by to face and
it is there Matt I palette I know I've
got time ATS in a row but they're very
very different we've got vintage violet
yeah we'll show you pebbles and we'll
show you fresh linen which is kind of a
light pink now these are with absolutely
no primer and swatches watch it hmm so
so so pretty now these are not as
pigmented as the ones from the bomb but
there I think they're a little easier to
work with because of that if you're
newer to eye shadow and you want
something that is going to be easy to
blend really easy to work with I
definitely recommend this palette just
gorgeous gorgeous shades blend very
nicely into each other I think
the reason why well I'll tell you the
reason why I love Matt shadows as
opposed to shimmery sometimes is just
the way that they blend seamlessly into
each other with a with a shimmer shadow
sometimes it's hard to get it to look
like um like a pastel painting if you
know what I mean like it's more water
colors vs. pastels I don't know if that
makes sense but it's just easier to get
the colors to go into each other and
look seamless in the matte shades at
least that's my opinion this is the
Rockstar palette by the bomb it is so so
stinkin funny this palette I mean just
just the ditch the packaging and the
names of these colors crack me up so bad
I lived this time you know the 80s and
the early 90s where these bands were all
very popular this is called Bon Jovi of
course after Bon Jovi you've got this
nice mirror in the top and then you've
got these gorgeous fantastic shades
you've also got a highlighter a blush
and then you open up and you have these
two lip products now I'm not the biggest
fan of these lip products I'm not the
biggest fan of lip products in a palette
just in general because you put it on
you leave the house unless you're taking
this whole big bad void with you
somewhere you're not going to be able to
reapply it so i don't really
particularly like that part of it even
though they're ok I let's watch a few of
these for you this one here is led
zeppelin this one here is Metallica and
this one here is presto and I will
swatch those on my hand for you I mean
look at those is oakley sorry about that
my swatches crooked but only seriously
the pigmentation least that is the worst
lookin swatch I have ever done in my
entire life you think I don't do this
all the time terrible let's try that
again that was awful okay Led Zeppelin
is a green it's a kind of a deep hunter
green with some gold glitter in it
Metallica is just like a silver and
white and then presto is a deep matte
brown check those babies out oh nice
sweet love them on the highlighter shade
is gorgeous absolutely gorgeous and here
is the bluff shade there I mean just so
so pretty i'll swatch those two just for
good measure I
look at the pigmentation seriously
seriously I mean unbeatable pigmentation
you have to be really gentle with these
are all so you can easily go overboard
but the bomb stuff I suggest you wait
till they go on hautelook if you don't
know how it look you probably do but
look is a flash snow website and the
bomb goes on there about every three or
four months and you can get all of their
products at half price that's when I buy
them the only thing about that is
there's a lot of products that they have
on the bombs website that they don't
have on hautelook but if you're looking
for meet Matt nude you're looking this
is the nude tude palette by them that's
also really nice if you're looking for
some of their older products that have
been around for a while you can find
them usually on hautelook the last one
and maybe because it's new that's why I
love it so much and it is oh I love this
it is the spellbinding I shadow book by
Kat Von D this is brand new it just came
out it is amazing and you can see I
don't know what happened here but it
looks like she's a vampire like I don't
know why it looks that happen something
must have happened over with the rest of
my palettes I don't even know but this
love love love this town one thing i
don't like about this palette is that it
has the plastic on the cover i just
think that's annoying also there's no
mirror but it's not a you know bus for
me one thing i hate about some pallets
let me show you an example like the Vice
pout the original vais pas no bunch to
just came out I don't know if they have
the same problem with the vice to as I
have with the vice but when you get
pallets like this you seriously I cannot
make an entire i look with this too many
dark colors too many bright colors just
too much uh not everyday wearable kind
of stuff for me but when you get into
the kat von d there are so many blending
and transition colors along with the
brights that the looks in this palette
are just stinking endless I mean I I'm
just oh oh wait that's upside down I
have not found a shadow in here that
does not work I mean just really cool
cool colors there i mean just so so neat
I am so stinkin tempted to swatch every
single color on this for you but this
video will go on forever so i think what
i'm going to do is I am going to put
this in a video all on its own coming up
in the next couple of weeks so make sure
you subscribe so that you don't miss
that I'll highlight all of my favorite
shades in here the shades that I feel
work together as combo so I'll do that
another video because I don't want to
make this video super long really what I
want to get across to you is that these
shadows are so versatile you can come up
with a ridiculous amount of looks with
them I mean it is just a really fun
palette to play with and it's brand new
so those are my top 5 pallets of all
