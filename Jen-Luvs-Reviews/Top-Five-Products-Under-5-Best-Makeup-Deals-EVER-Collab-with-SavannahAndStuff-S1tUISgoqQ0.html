very very exciting video now I am a firm
believer in not overpaying for things
because you know who needs to spend a
ridiculous amount of money on something
that does the exact same thing I mean
there's something to be said for feeling
luxurious and feeling like you're
treating yourself to something but
sometimes girlfriends on a budget you
know what I'm saying and we need to be
spending a ton of stuff ton of money on
stuff that is not necessary so the
purpose of this video is to show you
some awesome products that you can get
for five dollars or under now this is a
collaboration with my good friend
Savannah over at Savannah and stuff I
love me some Savannah if you've never
seen Savannah's channel she is
absolutely fab superpro amazing
awesomeness I will link her video and
her channel down below if you were
unaware of her you should get aware she
is awesome so let's go ahead and move on
to my favorite products for five dollars
under now I kind of cheated a little bit
it's supposed to be five products for
five dollars and under but I'm kind of
I'm gonna give you five types of
products for five dollars wonder because
it was so much stuff that I wanted to
show you that i couldn't limit it to
five specific products so let's go ahead
and jump in I've tried I tried to pick
some things that you may not know about
I mean there's some obvious ones so I'm
gonna Captain Obvious some stuff for you
first so someone's that you may already
know about is the first one I want to
talk about is the comfort zone palette
by wet and wild when wild pallets are
kind of hit or miss the ones in the
black packaging are pretty consistently
awesome I've heard great things about
their new line and i will put the name
of it here i can't remember what it's
called off the top of my head but
supposedly those are amazing these are
amazing this comfort zone palette is
amazing for anyone of any skin tone also
i love that it says brow bone eyelid
crease and what does that say definer
down there to kind of help you know
where to put them there's also a little
bit of a code guide on the back this I
believe is a must-have for anyone trying
to do neutral looks especially for under
five bucks awesome awesome awesome deal
and you can get a ton of looks from here
you know you can use this greener side
over here if you want to where you can
use the brown side you can mix them up
however you want to do with this this
palette is so versatile and amazing
and is very famous for being awesome all
right next up is a little more captain
obvious is the colour-pop I shadows
these are five bucks each now the other
I shout is that I owned by color pop are
in the sets those are not five dollars
because you have to get them in the set
this is the only one that i bought
purchased for five dollars today was the
first day I actually used it I have a
tutorial ish getting ready with me video
I'm not sure if I'm going to put up
before after this one it'll probably be
after but overall really loving the
color pop I shadows I would say look and
see how much glitter there is in the
swatch if there's lots of glitter in the
swatch I do not recommend those there's
a ton of fallout in those that I've seen
but the matte ones and the metallic ones
are phenomenal so highly highly highly
recommending these four five dollars
also at the drugstore which you may not
know about you may or may not the Milani
Bella I shadows are about five bucks
there are five dollars there for 99 in
my area they may be 450 I mean 550 in
some areas but they're 499 in my area so
I counted it these things are awesome
let me go ahead and swatch this one for
you in case you are not sure of the
amazingness that is these Bella I
shadows just totally fab I mean really
easy to blend very easy to work with
nice lasting power as well on these
Milani Bella eyeshadows highly recommend
these as well for five dollars alright
moving on to let's go to eyeliner these
are my new loves my new loves I just did
a whole video on Jake at beauty as a
brand these can only be found online i
believe at this point but totally worth
an online purchase these are their
eyeliners now again in the getting ready
with me that i did today i have the
these together to do this kind of ombre
i look i don't know if you can see that
you can recruit up in my eyeball i did
the dark blue here and the green here
and the silver here and i just love
doing that with these liners now these
liners last for quite a long time in the
water line which is very very rare for
an inexpensive liner these run about 250
apiece but they last on my lash line all
day long they're absolutely amazing
these were sent to me for review but
that does not influence my review they
are absolutely fabulous highly highly
highly recommend these I've got three
mascaras for you five dollars or under
the first one this one was in a beauty
box five
also sent to me for review this is the
scandalous mascara by nanticoke oh
that's what I'm wearing today and that's
what I use in that getting ready with me
oh my goodness just an amazing amazing
mascara I have had some trouble a little
bit of trouble with clumping on this one
but if you wiggle your brush usually you
can get those clumps out and it's not
too bad that the lengthening and the
volumizing of this oh my goodness in
that tutorial you'll be able to see that
1i went on better than the other one
that I know I that went on really well
went on really well I don't know if it
was operator error or what but no
flaking no smudging and none of that
just an amazing mascara for super super
cheap alright another classic one that's
talked about a lot is the Jordana best
lash extreme the original one of these
that I got was sent to me by Victoria
from Victoria Donalda she got me
addicted she got me hooked I now cannot
live without this mascara I absolutely
love it show you the wand on this one
this is a repurchase for me show you
that it looks very ordinary and we put
like this it looks very very ordinary
but it's not I promise you it is
extraordinary these mascaras are no
clumping no flaking well not little
clumping but minimal will say minimal
clumping no flaking lasts all day just a
really nice mascara and not difficult to
remove as well this is another one
that's a recent discovery of mine this
is the wet and wild max volume plus
mascara I've been warned about wet and
wild mascaras I've been told that when
mall mascaras are awful just as a
general rule of thumb this one I really
liked show you the wand here this one is
a rubber bristle but it's a conical
rubber bristle and the bristles are very
very short so if you need a mascara to
grab and hugged your lashes this one's
not for you but it does separate lashes
very nice and the formula on it is super
awesome again no flaking amazingness
really really love love love this
mascara okay it's just a couple of
things for face here's a couple of blush
recommendations for you city colors be
matte blushes these are now at five
below if you're on the East Coast these
are amazing you can also get them on the
city color website we'll do a little
swatching action i believe i got this in
an Ipsy bag I'll show you they can kick
up powder you can see it's kind of
flaking there but they can kick up how
to just be aware of that but absolutely
gorgeous i'll do a brush swatch and just
absolutely beautiful on the cheeks you
can go to clown face pretty easily on
this you've got to be careful in your
application but it's an amazing product
lasts all day and under five bucks the
other one under five bucks is another
jcat beauty this one is in love and love
Star Trek II oh I love struck but it's
called baby boo they've got really cute
names for the blushes they're like the
line is called love struck so they're
all like little nickname that you might
call your loved one they have these cats
on here that have an overspray if you
i'll put a link link i'll put a picture
here of what it originally looked like
when i got with the overspray on it
these things are just amazing i'll try
to put it like over here I mean the
pigmentation is just ridiculous this one
is extremely pigmented so definitely be
careful with this i'm just going to
barely tap watch this one evening should
i got the other off BAM just barely
touch it touch it one more time BAM two
little taps and so two little taps will
give you a nice light coverage and then
we'll kind of rub it down once to show
you how it can get really buildable and
deep okay little deeper there and will
swirl it a bit and make it even deeper
still so you can really build this up to
some craziness if you want to I was sent
two of these for review and love them
both this one is the deeper of the two I
was set and then the last thing for
cheek products that i want to show you
under five dollars is my new love this
is the city color contour effects
contour kit i am wearing that today i do
use that in the tutorial thingy that i
did and it comes with a contour shade a
bronzing shade on a highlight shade this
highlight shade is going to be for your
luminous glow highlight it's not going
to be for lightning areas of your face
you really need a matte highlighter for
that which this does not provide this
one is for that luminous glow highlight
and it is fab just to show you what they
look like just holy cannoli up way down
here i'm running our arm room here Brian
Brian Brown just super pigmented amazing
the lasting power on this thing is just
ridiculous oh my gosh
really amazing and then I know I'm out
of products but this one is also amazing
look how giant that is this is City
color as well this is the Sunkist trio I
got the one with this one is called
bronze peach the other ones that the
blush wasn't really uh it wasn't really
blushy you know it was more of like skin
Tony so I got this one and this one is
also amazing boom bam bam I don't have
room for brush swatches but you can see
the pigmentation there and they just
they go on just beautifully i love that
the pans are also pretty big so you can
get your brush in there and really use
and apply them and this will last you
forever under five bucks so those are my
recommendations of course there are a
ton of other wonderful products under
five dollars you don't need to be
breaking the bank in order to get a
gorgeous makeup look so don't ever let
youtube convince you that you need to
spend twenty dollars on an eyeshadow or
on a single eyeshadow or $75 on an
eyeshadow palette or twenty-five dollars
on mascara it's not necessary it's fun
but not necessary you can get a ton of
great makeup products for five dollars
or under so hopefully you found some
great new things that you want to try in
