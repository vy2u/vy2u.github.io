we are headed to away from our home base
in Reykjavik and we are headed to local
store lone Nicholson Yoko salon and I
think that's how that's the height now
so I'm sure that's the closest I can get
that's where all icebergs are so we're
going to see some sights along the way
and then we're spending the night in
Yoko so long
spending the night there and then no

called when I am a town called HOF and
Hassan Hassan which is a little bit
further east where right now west of
Yoko salon Yoko so now we're like on
though on the west coast of Iceland and
we're going to the self to go see the
icebergs
yeah so when we see something - yeah
we're going to see glaciers and receive
waterfalls and I'm going to take you
with us
so cold out
waiting there's allies the middle of
July July it's so windy and cold we just
stepped off the gas station get coffee
because apparently when you rent a car
you get free coffee at all the gas
stations I think it's just it's probably
just like a rewards program that they
have around here like that if you are
part of that reward system the new you
Hannibal tag there you go you just scan
it on the road camp I mean we got free
little baby coffee you're both looking
for like huge coffees and we're like oh
I got some baby cozy huge American
coffee and I would have been good that's
okay we got stopped at another gas
station to get more fuel on fire right

freezing we have to let the people go
across the one-lane bridge we let all
them go and then we go
