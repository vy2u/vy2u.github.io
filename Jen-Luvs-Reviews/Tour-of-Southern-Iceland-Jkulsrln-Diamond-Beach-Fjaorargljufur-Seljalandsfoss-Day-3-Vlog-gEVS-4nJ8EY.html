our very nice little apartment that we
got that was very expensive because it
turns out in this part of Iceland you
basically have your choice of a hostel
or a like apartment like this so with
kids we didn't feel comfortable doing
the hostel so that's why we ended up
with an apartment and it's expensive so
or you can camp for free but we should
be really in hindsight that might have
been a better idea camping but you know
we didn't do that so that's true because
we would have had to have put it on the
plane and had have paid for extra
luggage to bring all of that so we would
have paid for something either way so
but you know this is a really nice
little place we're very thankful to be
here we're having a little bit of
breakfast just some coal back with
having some toast and some will kind of
cold toast
bananas apples coffee there's a coffee
machine here and then we are headed back
to Reykjavik so we're going to go back
to Europa Salome and then we're going to
go see the canyon that I can't pronounce
and a couple of other things all on the
way back and yeah as we did yesterday we
will be taking you with us and then
tomorrow we are doing the Blue Lagoon
which is the big huge very popular hot
spring so I'm excited to bring you there
too but yeah so we'll see you back at
your bus alone
any friend of the horn and eating it to
grab I can't looks like the grass was
kind of nibbled right on the edge and
they can't reach the big one worried
about them getting bitten you prepare
for your rooster and the slow buddy
there you go nama I do you want to treat
stuff I'm having fun watching you guys
but it's terrible music
-
Hey
all I wanted feeling my love daddy daddy
vacuum your purse long and narrow our
infirmary in the daytime they look quite
different nothing let's see what the
speaker with something what amazing who
knows that how blue everything don't
breakfast for the waters others work I
don't know right like cereal without a
peep out of the water - weird
basically I'm tryna I don't know if it's
safe so just drink - okay so they say
that water here super clean
yeah ever so if it comes out of a tap
for the cranes come down on themself and
go the career all zombie yeah i la
cámara we're now at the blacks and each
is across the way from
and look at their command I don't know
if that's going to come across how
beautiful that is but it was sparkly
black I have the sudden urge to paint my
nails this color black with silver
glitter gorgeous for that
they have awesome
rocking back and forth
three chicks
we're here in a bathing suit
place that I cannot tell if nothing can
get me dry
probably one of the hardest words I've
ever seen right now but it's a canyon
and this is the bottom of it at least
the bottom of this part and hopefully
the rest of family will be willing to go
up to the top to look down at it really
so right there where they're walking
yours take barely anything to touch it
was holding them up I'm not going down
I'm being honest I lost me over here and
that was enough to mean still really
really
like if you look like nothing
much too much for me did you like it
though no no I to march on it's not
worth going off all with no it wasn't
was he scary nope
if there's no meeting here for to do a
jacket there's nothing to give well
you're supposed to look at it miss must
appreciate the beauty of it yeah thank
you all right Philo's too creepy you
like it or it's too creepy
what do you think cool
makes me want to slide down that thing
dude there's like a big waterslide thing
over there natural water swimming now I
wanted to add to the vlog because he had
quite uh we had a great day so far we
have one more waterfall to see before
the ends of our trip and back Reykjavik
we try to go out to dinner and what
happened we try to go to dinner
I am John Erwin everybody only dinner
tonight
that's important yeah yeah the wait was
like they said an hour but I had a
feeling so it could be longer than the
hour and then sitting and eating and
it's already getting late so we decided
to just go to the grocery store and get
just grocery store sandwiches and
actually I've been working out really
well the kids really liked their food
and my husband really liked his I didn't
like mine that much but it was assumed
it was good enough and I'm not going to
complain about it it was fine so yeah so
we got it done in less than half the
time we would be spent on 30 minutes
getting dinner instead of two hours and
we saved about 50 bucks because the meal
TR are super expensive so we said of
spending $30 30 $30 on the sandwiches at
the grocery store it was like 30-some
dollars were were grocery store like
prepackaged things and for drinks which
is really expensive for us standards but
compared here like if we went into the
restaurant it would have cost us 80 to
120 dollars even the restaurant so save
a lot of money I worked out well in the
end but but yeah so we're going to go
ahead and head to I'm going to say this
wrong but it's so
seljalandsfoss waterfall and that will
be our last stop before we head back to
rock that way three of you I'm not going
to
power of nature and we are officially
bundled up oh my goodness this birthday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
