about toys subscription box cool are you
excited to get your first toy
subscription box yeah yeah I'm excited
too but hopefully he'll be just as
excited after he finds out what's in it
hmmm I invited John on here John has
been looking for a good subscription box
for him
Lila gets a bunch of different things
and we haven't really found a good one
for him
so when toy box monthly contact me and
asked me if I wanted to do an unboxing
of this I kind of selfishly for my kids
said yes so this is gonna be an
additional video on to the beauty videos
I do my beauty videos on Tuesday and
Thursdays this is just a bonus so that I
could get a free box for my son so that
we could decide whether this would be a
good subscription for him if you have
kids or if you like toys then you get a
bonus unboxing on my channel and my son
is getting free toys which is always a
good thing for him right yep panic free
toys let me tell you a little bit about
this box before we open it they do have
a boys version and a girl's version of
course gender is flexible so you have to
kind of think about your own child and
decide what their preferences tend to be
and which one you think will be best for
your child no matter what your child's
gender is so you get 4 to 6 toys and
it's for ages 3 to 103 is what it says
when you click on the subscription it
says that it's 17 dollars a month and
you do have to cancel it or else it's
recurring and then you do have an option
for for every three months and then
that's $45 for the three months and
that's where they get the $15 price from
and that reoccurs every three months so
are you ready yeah all right I'm gonna
use the scissors and I'm gonna open it
and then I'm just gonna hand it to you
and you're in charge now okay you're six
you are able to do this okay there you
go
what is it
it's a bobblehead it's from The Avengers
two mystery mini yes I've seen this
before
where would I see them I've seen them
from a bunch of different unboxing
YouTube channels cool what we fell out
fell out okay what'd you get I got I
don't actually know this guy I I don't
know who this guy is it doesn't say well
we'll have to look him up and I'll put a
little annotation for us that says what
his name is is just attached by a little
spring so if you pull his head real hard
his head will come off and you probably
won't be able to put it back on so what
do you think are you excited to have him
yeah take the next thing out and I
pulled out the same thing as before but
a little different oh okay so that one
is my is what is I don't know what is
this word say transformers okay okay I
know none of those characters yeah
you're not you're not as big into
transformers I dunno like Optimus Prime
mm-hmm
you know the bad guys name I think it's
Megatron yeah yeah and I could think
pretty sure sure
my big brother would be disappointed in
me that I don't know these things that
was his favorite that's definitely you
know what his name is I just said it I
forgot Optimus Prime
yep I'm not very digging to this stuff
but I do it's cool hard to transform
there you go you got it so it goes from
the the little guy and then you could
transform it so he turns into his truck
there yep he turns into a octopus prime
truck is that fun to do yeah it is like
I like this one okay I like this one
better than the
because that one you can actually
transform and the other one you can see
just like Bob lemon up okay let's see
what's next
okay went on let's see it's super
Mario's a sticky note art kit so let me
go ahead and cut this open this is seems
like the coolest thing yet it has this
let's see oh I see look look John John I
don't get it okay it says 8-bit art is a
kit for creating amazing pixel paper
pixel art on any glass surface poster
boards or on walls that are painted with
flat paint so you could put this on your
wall and what you do is you measure the
wall and you mark it out and then you
put the pixels down and you end up
making a Super Mario on your wall with
the stickers that's cool what do you
think do you think you'll do that yeah I
might actually do that I I feel like
there there is definitely more than two
things what is that what does that say
it's Imaginext Legos series seven
includes one mystery figure and
accessory okay I'm I'm interested in
this I think that a pirate a pirate guy
yeah say does it say what his name is
okay hold it up between our heads see
right here this is him with his cloak on
and this is him without his cloak on I
also got a little speery thing and this
is him completely assembled whoa whoa
whoa what is it cool
it's called a tech deck and it's for
flipping so I think I've seen these
online and you you can do tricks with it
cool and it looks like you got one
called Louie that's the name of your
uncle and he's got a it's got a tiger on
it so very cool we'll have to look up
more about this and how it works yes all
right you ready for the last is it one
more thing in there roars that's it okay
so let us review John remember this cost
$17 so you have to decide whether you
think this is worth 17 dollars so we
have a bobble head a transformer dying
within transform we have a cool dude
with a vest and also it has a dragon on
his on his leg
uh-huh he'll never notice and he has a
vest pretty cool and this it's like a
thing where we can make our hundred wall
and we also have something that can make
that can do really cool tricks very cool
that's it I think it's worth it you
think it was worth seventeen dollars so
is this something you think you would
want to mommy to buy for you for future
yeah is there anything in here you don't
think you would play with that you're
not interested in anything that I don't
think I would play with I think I would
give this to Lila so you think you would
give this to your sister yeah I'll give
that to Lila's you're not as big into
the artsy kinds of things yeah some kids
might like that more than you do right
but other than that everything else you
really liked yeah I also I really like
this bubble eyes like so I guess you I
just kind of have to think about your
own kid
this was the one targeted for boys but
you have to think about your own kid and
what your own kid likes I know my
niece's really love stuff like this so
deciding on what's best for your own kid
I think it's gonna be important I do
think that we are going to invest in
another month and see how it goes and
then if he continues to like it maybe
we'll do a three month subscription I
don't want to continue boxes like this
on the channel just because it's not
makeup related but I think it's fun to
do these every once in a while
to do something a little bit different
on the channel just for fun so thank you
