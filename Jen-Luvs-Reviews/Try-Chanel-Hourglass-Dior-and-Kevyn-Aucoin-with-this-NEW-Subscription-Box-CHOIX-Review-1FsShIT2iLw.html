hello my friends welcome to a new box
that I wanted to share with you because
this one is very very very different and
I specifically contacted Troy and asked
them if they would send me a box because
I thought you all will be interested and
knowing about it especially those of you
that have a couple bucks to kick around
thinking about buying some high end
makeup but don't want to buy it unless
you've tried it first or just curious
about certain high-end brands then you
just don't want to spend thirty or forty
dollars on a lipstick or home you know
lip gloss or whatever so joy would be
perfect for you if that's you now if
you're looking for most bang for your
buck high-value low-cost this is
definitely not gonna be for you but I
want to show it to you anyway because
it's really neat ok so joy is twenty
dollars a month including shipping and
you go on their website and you pick out
things that you would like to sample
from their high and products that they
have and then they see it send you
samples of those products and I'll show
you what they sent me I did not go
through the entire process they picked
out these products for me this is how
the box comes this is your your box it's
actually a very nice outer packaging I
don't know if I can repurpose this or
what but it's got a little magnetic
closure in the front it's very fancy
shmancy says the makeup products in this
box are for cosmetic use only that our
Choi cosmetic consultants lovingly and
hygienic Lee repackage this product it's
a brand new unused sample containers for
you to enjoy each sample container
contains approx point 1 grams 2.5 grams
of products these are samples of
full-size products manufactured and
distributed by the luxurious makeup
brands listed on the toy website for a
full list of ingredients please refer to
the manufacturers website so that's what
it says on the back gives you a little
bit more information about things and
then don't be shocked the sample or
small but the point is to try something
so these are the samples that I got a
thing that gave me was a Smashbox
mascara okay in order to apply this cute
little package with a little tie on it
that says it says etcetera on it it's
very cute and then it comes with little
tools here I don't know if they all come
with the exact same thing or not but
mine came with two
applicator sponges to mascara wands and
a little mini blush brush ish kind of
thing which i think is very cute to
include i don't know if this is a
hundred percent of surrey these are a
hundred percent necessary I don't know
if these are because I'm assuming if
you're looking for high end makeup you
already have eyeshadow brushes or blush
brushes that you typically use so I hope
that they'll listen to feedback from
people whether you know maybe make it
the box a little less expensive or
something without including all of these
extras or whether people really enjoy
and use these extras now the mascara
though you need one of these in order to
do it now this is the smell just a
Smashbox mascara I'm assuming this is a
double exposure I do own the double
exposure and it seems to perform exactly
the same it is a really really nice
mascara but what you do is you open it
up and there's no one you have to dip
this inside in order to use it now of
course you that you don't get the effect
of the actual mascara one but I don't
even know honestly how much difference
the mascara wand truly makes I really
feel like it's mostly the product that's
going to give you an idea of whether
you're going to like a mascara or not
whether it's dry weather it's wet
weather it's clumpy whether it lengthens
whether volumizes whether it stays wet
weather it you know I mean whether it's
heavy I mean you're going to be able to
feel all of that with this the
applicator i think is can make a
difference but it's really you applying
it and your technique and what's in here
i think makes more of a difference than
the one but anyway that's enough of that
so i did try this I really really liked
it and enjoyed it I would have if I had
purchased this myself then I would know
exactly which smashbox mascara the city
the next thing I want to show you is
this Kevin a quan lip gloss in blood
roses oh my goodness ladies oh my
goodness this stuff like I never had any
desire to try I Kevin apollon lip gloss
I mean I know Kevin upon stuff is
amazing i have one of the eyeshadow do
it but that's all i have but honestly I
had no idea it has a little tiny teeny
tiny doe foot applicator I'm going to
come up real close and swatch for you
and it's just this gorgeous gorgeous
shade I don't know if you can that even
God doesn't even do it justice our lips
watching is going to have to happen
because
that's watch to not do it I have my lack
of and company lip lube on I love that
stuff but it's coming off mmm okay let's
get up close and personal sprint around
bit mmm-hmm love it love it love it love
it so it's got a slight scent to it a
little bit fruity a little bit plasticky
but it's not offensive in the scent but
I love the tone of it I absolutely love
the tone of it it's a nice wash of color
I think this would be beautiful paired
over top of a lipstick to kind of either
deepen it up or make it a little bit
more of that brownie kind of shade
that's really really popular right now
but oh my goodness so in love with this
so in love with this so now of course I
want Kevin upon lip glosses that's what
they do a toy is they they they tell you
they teach you about all these wonderful
products that you now feel like you need
okay so let's move on I also got a an
ambient lighting powder in radiant
lighting and I do own the ambient
lighting powder set I'm not sure if this
is in there or not let me check and see
just approved you all that this stuff's
legit this is the real palette and let's
hold it up close to the sample okay and
will swatch but one on the right is from
Choi the one on the left is mine and
let's watch and of course they're
identical just a gorgeous gorgeous
gorgeous highlight know if you know our
glasses radiant light encounters if you
always want to try one now you can and I
feel like this is enough product to last
at least 10 uses I mean how much
highlight do you really need I really
and truly I this is this is plenty of
highlight to last you a hot minute all
right next up we got the ellis faas
creamy eyes eyeshadow and it's an e 104
and it looks like it is kind of a deep
brown and it's a cream
and will swatch it's very very very soft
very soft and creamy there now this is
probably one of the least my least
favorite things that I got I don't
typically wear cream eyeshadows that are
not used as an eyeshadow base I did try
to use it to kind of smoke out my outer
corner and it wasn't very functional for
me for that this is probably one that I
wouldn't personally have picked but
maybe some of you would have picked
something like this it's not because of
the quality of the product it's just
because it's just not something that I
typically use a cream shadow that's not
used as a big ass is this bobby brown
metallic eyeshadow in cognac and this
one is beautiful so that's how much
product you get a little more here you
go and put that right up there I mean
look at that pigmentation it almost
looks like the cream shadow doesn't it
but it's very very blendable it's a
beautiful shot this is just this is a
really gorgeous shadow it's got that
bronzy Sheen to it without being
glittery this is whoo I almost dropped
it the other thing is is it's it's
pressed it's not like it's a mineral
eyeshadow where it's gonna flake all
over the place it's pressed in there so
that's really really nice that I can go
like this and the product is not coming
out and it's an eyeshadow hello okay so
anyway it's got a really nice bronzy
Sheen to it i've used this in my crease
that kind of deep it on my crease and
it's absolutely gorgeous and I never
would have tried this oh maybe a bobby
brown eyeshadow are probably not this
exact shade this is the thing about Choi
joining twenty dollars a month this is
what you get you don't get a lot of
product but what you can do if you like
one of the products that you got this is
how to get you if you like one of the
products that you got you can use ten
dollars of your twenty dollars that you
spent toward buying a full size of one
of the products that you had ordered I
think that's pretty awesome the only
thing about the ten dollars toward
something that you got as a sample is it
only lasts for that month and it doesn't
accumulate that is a real you know on
this subscription I wish that they
accumulated one thing that the people
actually told me is that are working on
a point system which I think would be
amazing I think that's really smart of
them
customers feel like they want to be
rewarded and you know when you've spent
twenty dollars and you've only gotten
this much product I don't know I just I
feel like with this you know if you're
not going to invest in the full size
that this might not be worth it to you
you know I'm saying because you don't
get a whole lot of product unless you
are really looking to try some of these
products and you're doing it for the
experience of trying these high-end
products then it's definitely worth it
but you're not this is not a bang for
your buck subscription like i said
before but it is a fun one i mean even
if you like have a couple products that
you're really interested in trying and
you see them on the toilet site and you
just try it for a month just to try
those things you've always wanted to try
that you can't sample at sephora i think
that's pretty amazing mostly I just
really wanted to show you the
subscription because it's number one
it's new number two it's unique and
number three I wanted to hear what child
would think of it because I have some of
the smartest most amazing subscribers
and friends on YouTube ever in all of
YouTube anything you see as being things
they could improve any things that you
wish that they had any things that you
love about it that you're excited that
about the subscription I would like to
know I'm sure Troy would like to know
