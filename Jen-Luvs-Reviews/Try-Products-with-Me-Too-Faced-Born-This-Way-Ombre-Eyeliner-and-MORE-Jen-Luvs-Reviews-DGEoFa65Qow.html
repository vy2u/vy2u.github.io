hello my friends welcome to my getting
ready to film what's up in makeup video
I wanted to highlight some products that
I have been trying and kind of give you
some first impressions of some things
that I've been using so I figured we
just do like a little talk through
getting ready with Meeks haven't done
one of these in a little while okay I'm
trying out today the new born this way
foundation from Too Faced so I don't
want to use like a hardcore like my
favorite primer like my Smashbox primer
because I don't want it to influence the
application of the foundation too much
so I'm just going to use this body shot
vitamin C skin boost which is a really
nice primer helps my makeup stay on
longer but it doesn't like Phil pores or
anything like that so it's fourth of
July today in real time so I've got um
for the July nails which I spent forever
doing I couldn't get this one stamp to
go on right I literally took me like oh
I don't know four or five tries to get
that one on so I'm very happy that they
finally turn out lil zoom in a little
bit they're not perfect instagram worthy
nails but you know i mean we got real
people nails here on this channel and um
you know far from perfect so i've got i
got these from Ipsy from the from the
point system a tipsy and i was very very
thankful to be able to get these thanks
to people signing up using my length so
if you ever signed up for MC using my
link i thank you so much because of you
I was able to get these I have light
beige and I have vanilla and I found
that I am kind of a mix of these two
colors so what I do with these are
they're really nice they have the pump I
just do the light and see how that's
like a little bit too light for me the
consistency is pretty thick but it's
also you know it drips it's gonna duel
just a little bit of the light beige and
then I just kind of mix them together on
my hand a bit and then just plop plop
plop plop and I pretty much put on just
one pump for my entire face because I
feel like with this foundation it's
enough okay and then this is my flat
kabuki brush by outer beauty I love this
brush and I just smash it all over my
face like
you know nothing crazy okay bring it
down the neck a little bit one thing
I've noticed I have to be really careful
to make sure I get all the way over to
my ears or else i end up with a line and
I can't see that part of my face so it's
important for me to do that the other
thing I do is after there's hardly any
product left on my brush I do go over my
brows because I'm going to do my brows
in a minute so there you go there is the
Born This Way Foundation without any
powder on ok the next product i'm going
to be using is this Estee Lauder Double
Wear brush on glow I'm gonna use it's
just to highlight my under eyes I do
this before I apply powder because I
feel like if I don't then it gets a
little bit cakey so what I do is I go
straight down and then I go and then
just kind of hook it around I know that
looks weird it's probably a little bit
too low I don't want it that low more
like there is where I want to stop it
and boom boom and it doesn't look this
crazy once you blend it and then I just
kind of fill that in I know that looks
so funky and weird is that pretty even
it's not gonna look this funky in a
minute or douche what I do okay and then
I just take my fingertips and just
gently blend blend it out okay and that
gives me just like a nice under I
highlight and it'll blend in a little
better once I get my power on and my
contour and everything so Val Yago today
I'm not having a whole lot of under eye
circles so I can go ahead and be a
little extra high lady with my under
eyes since I'm not teaching right now
I'm not as sleepy which is good my
redness in my eyes has gone down but a
lot of people comment on that my eyes
are very red and it's because during the
school year I don't sleep another
product i've been using a lot lately is
this besame this is the brightening
vanilla powder I really like this a lot
one thing that's a critique of mine with
this is this puff works fabulously
but I can't get the stupid thing to stay
on my fingers like maybe it's just my
fingers are just the wrong shape or
something so I end up having to use the
brush this is the blush brush by Real
Techniques and I love this brush so what
I do is I just tap this into here into
the cap there and then I end up with
about that much and then I take this and
then I just kind of Pat around my face
like that I don't want to move my
foundation around a whole lot so I just
kind of evenly Pat it around until I
have a nice matte finish or semi mad
because this foundation doesn't really
provide a matte finish it's like
supposed to be like a skin like finish
how's that looking when you think how am
i doing it's got a really nice light
vanilla scent kind of like the chocolate
sent that you get with some to face
products this has a really nice light
vanilla scent I love it ok I'm going to
be using my body ography essential brow
trio that I got in my box each arm if
you get boxy charm you will know what
I'm talking about this is the love right
here this thing is fab this is the only
thing I liked about the nude sticks
product my god is the case oh not a
product that I was a fan of all right I
forgot even what it was was it oh it was
a lengthening mascara it was terrible it
did nothing but I like the case here for
the mirror and for my brows I like my
brows relatively natural but I've got
spaces and things here that I need to
fill in so actually they don't look too
bad today um but I do need to fill it in
a bit so I'm going to use the darkest
color from the brow kit and go her on
walk right out I just always start in
the middle here and then work my way out
I do kind of a mix of padding and
brushing kind of get the texture that I
want and then spoolie it out and this is
the body ography brush that came with it
all right the brows done my trap make
sure I'm nice and blended we don't want
any thick spots I don't like my brows to
be super like thick thick looking fake
looking that's just may what should we
do next let's do eyes next all right
this is a good go to the Mac Paint Pot
in painterly fabulous product and I've
had this thing forever and it's still
not dried out on me I really like it a
lot one of the I don't own a lot of Matt
products but this is definitely one if
you're looking for a good eye base would
highly recommend i like it because it
meets out the discoloration and my lids
kind of makes it a more neutral color
and it helps my shadow stay on longer
okay let's do some color pop action
going on let's see my shirt is kind of
cool toned and most of the color pop I
shadows that I have our warm-up toned
I'm going to use this as a base this is
the color pop shadow in in a pickle that
I just got and I haven't I haven't used
it yet so let's go ahead and start with
that overall I'm really liking the color
pop I shadows I don't like the glittery
ones because I'm getting a lot of
fallout in them I don't know if you all
have that problem but I really am
getting a ton of fallout on some of the
shadows which is like mmm hate fall out
where you get glare by the end of the
day your cheeks look like just been with
some glitter I hate it so I gotta use a
mirror for this because I got to make
sure I do it as well oh that's pretty
it's a nice matte little chunky there I
guess since its fourth of July should
probably have fourth of July eyes but
it's not fourth of July where you are so
I would look a little weird to you
fourth of July I look
after for the July I'm having a little
bit of trouble building this up to where
I want it to be it's building it's just
taking a while very nice ok now I'm
going to use the elf palette in need it
nude which is my new fave I love love
love this palette and I'm going to be
using this shade over here as a as it
well I guess it's not really going to be
a transition because it's kind of dark
for me but I'm going to put it up in my
crease to kind of give my crease some
dimension and this brush is by Coastal
Scents and it's a crease brush by them i
forget the the name of it i will link it
down below if i can but look at that
it's like a little strawberry chocolate
action going on I like that I'm liking
that a lot I'm just kind of winging it
here cuz this is what I do every day I
just kind of wing it you know and I'm
loving the mat so I'm going to keep
going with the mat I like it a lot ok so
now i'm going to use as a blending color
for my for my brow bone because i don't
want that stiff line there i'm just
going to use this first shade here I
mean you see how easily these things go
on I mean it's unbelievable if you
didn't tell me that this was elf I would
never know I would think I was working
with a high-end shadow right now now the
only thing that's not high-end about
these is the staying power by you know
right now it's what close to noon by six
o'clock they'll be faded now I'm going
to use this this one in my inner corner
just to give me a little pop that cream
color see it's not super opaque but it's
enough this is a Wayne Goss brush and I
believe its number 2020s number 20 and
I'm going to use one of these deeper
shades just cut my crease a bit i'll use
this last one down here just to give a
little bit more definition because it's
not really cutting my crease it's just
giving more definition to the crease
just right
right there is where I want it
you
oh no my husband status are you almost
done filming lots of and makeup no I'm
feeling pretty good about that I'm gonna
let that me because it doesn't have to
be allowed in order to be pretty and I
think a lot of YouTube tutorials online
are just very very loud but you can do a
subtle look and have it still be really
pretty and I'm liking the way this is
looking right now and I'm just gonna
leave it alone okay tattoo liner in
trooper by Kat Von D this is an oldie
but a goodie hey did you guys notice
this is one thing that kind of bugs me
like I love me some kat von d love me
some kat von d but the new one that she
has out can I focus and talk at the same
time I don't know um the new trooper one
benefits like animals like Animal Rescue
I think it's five dollars it's five
dollars more expensive but you're paying
only one dollar is being donated to the
cause I don't get that I'm just going to
do a little tiny winged today and if
you're just learning to do a wing I
definitely recommend doing just a little
tiny wing at first and then working your
way up to a larger wing but yeah I don't
get that like how are you going to
charge five dollars more and then only
donate a dollar like what is that what's
that all about like I'm not questioning
Kat Von D's intentions or anything but
that just seems kind of messed up I mean
is the packaging really four dollars
more expensive than the original I don't
think so no what am i doing losing it
I'm losing it come on point all right on
a minute I got to get that pointy can I
do this how'd I do I can't see what I'm
doing No Oh terrible sometimes that
happens especially when I'm like
crossing over usually have a makeup
mirror and I'm able to let go like this
let me see if I can do it in this here
we go I think I can mmm the trick is
that flick at the end to get that point
close enough
I wanted to show you guys this mascara
this is the scandalous mascara by
nanticoke oh this is like a four dollar
mascara here's the wall in there for you
it's just like a fat chubby rubber
bristle wand wait till you see this
mascara like amazing I'm making that
mascara face though I go cross between
uh what and then I'm gonna puke I think
I was and then goes making the face BAM
pretty awesome right okay let's go you
know oh the side so what's your favorite
mascara right now what are you loving
because I'm always up for trying new
mascaras especially drugstore mascaras
because girlfriend does not need to
spend thirty dollars on a mascara if
it's not necessary like look at this and
there's no flaking you can see there's a
little bit of clumping but there's no
flaking none this brand is so under
hyped I don't know what they're doing
with their marketing but they need to
step it up and tell people about this
stuff so there you go we'll go in with a
second coat and the second coat goes on
pretty easily it's not like um it
doesn't get stuck like sometimes
mascaras will dry and they'll get hard I
feel like the my other I went on easier
than this I did you ever feel like that
like your mascara doesn't go on evenly
from i to i like what's up with that
maybe it's like an application thing
maybe I apply it differently because
this I is not cooperating with me at all
what's up with that like I've got this
big space there what is that why is that
happening I don't know it like doesn't
look nearly as pretty as the other I
like really what is happening there do
not know all right we're gonna let it be
the other side I feel like went on
really easily and nicely I don't know
we're going to ahead and we're going to
try one of these new color pulp liquid
lipsticks I got four of the
so match him a shirt a little bit let's
see I've got some pink down here delmer
maybe we'll do kind of do some
matchy-matchy here in SOL oh I don't see
how this goes ah what so because i'm
filming i was thinking about using one
of my new color pop liquid lipsticks but
this one I think is too like orangie for
what I'm wearing and for the i look i
just created i also just got these ones
from jake at beauty these are the lipids
i know some people got them in their um
their ypsi bags but i haven't tried
these yet and i really want to try this
bright pink some of you were so
encouraging with me with the bright
colors are when i did the jcat beauty
swatches want to do the jcat beauty
videos so i'm going to try this one this
one scares me but I'm gonna do it I'm
gonna do it it's called swag and we'll
see how this goes and this is their
liquid lipsticks oh yeah that's scary
holy moly
a little dry spot there when you think
you think I can rock this for what's up
and make up I like the edge of this
because it's point it's like real flat
so it's like pointy so you can really
get in there detailed I don't see any
feathering yet it's a little scary it's
a little scary is it too scary don't
look like a clown I think I did a subtle
enough I look that I can do this I don't
know what it's too scary okay let's do
this let's do this this is what we're
going to do that's too scary so I'm
gonna take one of these this one is this
is the bumble from colour-pop and I'm
gonna see if I can dull it down a bit
because this is just it's too much I
can't do it it's scary framing and that
did not really help ah ok it's a little
less scary okay we're just come up we're
gonna let that be boos oh my goodness
okay all right so then because I've got
this bright lip I'm not gonna go for a
crazy contour but I do you want to show
you this contour palette oh my gosh oh
if you have a fight below near you you
must you must you must okay this is a
Luxy brush I got this in an in a
subscription box at some point all right
so I'm gonna start in my ear and I'm
gonna go to like where the middle of my
eye is BAM whoa holy cannoli you see
that pigmentation you see that you see
that I'm not leaving it like that trust
me all right i'm gonna start at top of
my ear and we go to the middle of my
eyeball won't better to bring it back a
little more Oh want a little further on
that side who better to bring it back a
little more and then I go like this with
my brush and then I blend and you want
to blend downward not upward if you can
help it upwards fine a little bit but
you don't want to blend too much upward
and you don't want to blend so far down
that you um you're getting like beer
cheek all right i'm getting be your
cheek it's happening it's happening too
much too much too much blend it out
blend it down no shame in using the hand
get some of that all no shame no shame
and then i'm going to put all their
products on top so i don't have to worry
about it being
perfectly blended yet okay so now we're
going to do a little bit of the Baronne
shade here we're gonna do the same thing
straight over the top holy moly stuff is
pigmented classy right loving it loving
it no tools required no chula required
how's that looking hmm boom boom ba boom
ba ma ma ma ma ma ma ba ba boom boo boo
boo ok now the highlight shade I'm not
doing the whole face thing because I
feel like the whole face contour thing
sometimes can look completely overdone
and I just don't want to be overdone
today ba boom ba boom beautiful
highlight right is that as beautiful a
champagne pop oh no because this was
five bucks mm-hmm are we doing how we
doing ok just to give myself a little
bit more like pink eNOS to my cheeks I'm
going to use this Jake at Beauty blush
in Sweet Pea pink this one's really
subtle um it's a really nice shade for
someone that's my skin color or a little
bit a little bit lighter um it's not
gonna be effective for someone that's
deeper than me maybe a little deeper but
not much just to kind of bring it all
together do I look like I have a beard
sideburns maybe know even why aren't you
here telling me this wish you were right
here with me I wish I could hear your
comments right now like John try this do
this why can't she be here with me you
know will be fun as maybe I could do
like a getting ready with me live where
you guys can like tell me what I'm doing
like what you think about what I'm doing
give me advice could you know I'm not a
pro man I'm just a mom in my small tiny
house you know what I want to do is I
want to that hombre I was telling you
guys about and my friend Jenna wants to
see it so Jenna girlfriend this is for
you I'm going to use that motd eyeliners
by Jake at beauty
are like 250 each they're awesome ok I'm
going to start off with the blue one and
this is called sunrise blue and I'm just
going to do this on the outer corner
here a little chromium I'll ball yup ok
ok just that much just that much could
you guys see that because my camera
likes to go out of focus when I'm not
looking directly at you ok let's do the
other side just in that outer corner
just that much looking good looking good
you see that ok now I'm going to do the
green and this one is called tropical
green and we're going to do this in the
middle so we're going to go just like
that
then we're going to take the silver one
in gunmetal and we're going to do this
from the middle out
okay and depending on what you like you
can take this all the way to the inner
inner corner but I don't like it like
that I like to kind of stop and you see
how it just gives some dimension to that
lower lash line like I just love it I
absolutely love it and you can do this
with any light color so but you want to
start with the darkest then move to a
mid-tone and then the lightest on the
inner corner usually just kind of a
general rule of thumb at least for me is
that the inner corner you want to be
lighter in the outer corner you want to
be darker for eyeshadow eyeliner all of
that so that is that that is my finished
makeup look what do you think how did i
do what do you think of this foundation
I feel like I don't know if it looks
like it's my natural skin i don't know i
really like the way that looked when i
looked at the videos last week but as
far as wearing this day to day I don't
know how much I feel like this looks
like natural skin I feel like it's more
of a medium to full coverage foundation
I'm really curious to read what you will
think of the products that I use down
below what did you think about the way
that they applied are they products that
you'd be interested are they products
that you've tried before I cannot wait
