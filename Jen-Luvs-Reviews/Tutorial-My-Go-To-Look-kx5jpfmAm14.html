requested video it's pretty much the
only video that has been requested
multiple times from me to do which is a
tutorial on my everyday makeup that I do
there is a tag going around I think I
saw it on the sets beauty yeah i think
it was lestats beauty Emily did this and
it turned out wonderful your go to look
your your it's not when you're rushing
it's just what should do every day when
you're just doing your makeup so this is
what I do every day it might look
slightly different on camera than it
does in real life it's probably going to
look a little bit paler just because the
lights kind of washed me out a little
bit but I wanted to show you genuinely
what I do every day but it took about 20
minutes to get this look included in
this or how to do winged eyeliner
without using eyeliner because I can't
do any eyeliner so I cheat and I use
eyeshadow so if you were interested in
learning how to get this look then stay
tuned and I'll show you how I did it
here comes all right there is my face
yada yada yada here comes the revlon
concealer under my eyes dad and that
baby on revlon age-defying concealer and
cream and just blending that out with my
Real Techniques brush and that's this is
a setting brush but I think it really
fits nicely underneath my eyes so that's
what I use this now going into my new
Revlon nearly naked foundation was
really excited about getting this I
actually have a video coming up
comparing this to the urban decay naked
skin make sure you subscribe so you
don't miss that it's pretty good quickie
video I'm comparing the two and this is
actually in the color shell which is 130
and I'm blending that there with another
Real Techniques brush and this one is in
its an expert face brush and now we've
got our Revlon nearly naked powder and I
know I keep talking about Lizzie Josh
but she's amazing she's just fabulous
tutorials she had the recommendation of
using some kind of sponge to patch your
powder in before you use a brush to kind
of fluff it out and it really is
a nice matte finish to do that and I
just love this powder so happy with it
going into the Anastasia brow powder
just made a video about this one talking
about how sting and overpriced it is if
you can find an eyeshadow that matches
your eyebrow color I'm going to work
just as good a long wearing eyeshadow i
use this the lightest color in the inner
corners and then the darker color in the
middle to the outside to darken my brows
using an angled brush here this is a
sonia kashuk angle and um brush here's
eyebrow gel by anastasia just get some
yourself some clear mascara and it will
work just as good as this stuff keeps it
nice and in place instead of a primer
today i'm going to be using my
maybelline color tattoo this is the new
metal one in barely branded I love this
stuff really keeps my I shut it on
nicely this is nice and shimmery and
it's gonna go very very nicely with the
next step as I blend it with my fingers
but meet Matt nude I like to do a little
shimmer with a little Matt mix it up a
little bit I think gives a really nice
look I'm gonna go straight in with Matt
Abdul which is like a topi color and I'm
gonna use the big giant brush I've
considered from my eco tool set which is
a blend brush and if your eyes are any
smaller than mine you might want to get
a similar brush that's just a little bit
smaller than this one and I'm just
padding just stamping in the corner
whatever color I want to be my main
color of my look doing a nude looks this
taupe looks really really nice and now
I'm just blending that up into my crease
with the angled brush that comes in this
Ecotools set its on called the crease
brush I didn't add any color under this
I'm just blending it up the color i
already have up into my crease now
moving into the white for Matt Molloy
this is a very very um translucent white
I wouldn't recommend using a very thick
white you want something that's just a
little bit lighter than your skin color
because this one blends so easily out I
use that now going into matt wood which
is a dark brown and i'm using the teeny
teeny tiny one from this ego tool set
which is a shader brush and just making
a very harsh v on my outer corner this
Ecotools set it's like eight bucks and
you can pretty much find anywhere
they hopefully you can find around you
it is so cheap and so worth it now i'm
taking the highlighter brush and I'm
just swirly swirly swirly in the corner
and it just really makes it look nice
and blends out but it is a little messy
sometimes so I do like to use a little
makeup remover that's just a Maybelline
makeup remover and some some q-tip
thingies but they're like the pointy
kind and just drawing the line with the
makeup remover up toward my temple and
just wiping that baby off sometimes
people use tape to do this and I just
I'm not skilled enough to use tape this
works perfectly and it is so sting and
easy to do just to make it a nice clean
line for your eyeshadow I've been doing
that a lot lately I love it it works
great um now we're going to be using my
brand-new mica beauty liner this is a
gel liner I am so addicted to my bobby
brown gel liner which is so stupid
expensive I just got this mica liner in
my FC bag and it is so stinkin amazing
it blows away my bobby brown liner to be
completely honest I'm using an angled
liner brush there I think elf makes one
this one's a Sephora one but just any
really flat liner brush and you want to
just stick really close to your lashes
that's really the trick for this and
making it as thin as possible and then
just picking it up where you want it
especially toward the outer edge I'm not
going to wing here I'm gonna wing with
my eyeshadow because I think when I win
with my eyeliner it looks stupid so I
don't do that anymore and I'll show you
in a minute how to wing with eyeshadow
instead so I'm just kind of finishing
that up and now I'm going to go down to
my lower lid and I just like to dab it
in the corner in my waterline just to
kind of match that dark corner of my eye
shadow and I think think that looks
really nice to just make my lower lid
just kind of match everything like and
how it's looking so far nice little
thumbs up there so excited about this
mascara this is a new purchase this is
the AL may get up and grow and again I
have another video that I shot before
this of the comparison between the al
makeup and grow and the new dior curling
mascara so this video really doesn't do
this this mascara justice it's so much
prettier than this
so stay tuned for that video but you can
see I'm kind of wiggling the mascara
that just kind of makes sure it gets
every single lash so I just kind of give
it a little wiggle and if you have
mascara primer use that too I didn't use
that in this video I don't know why I
usually use it going back into my eco
tool set using the little teeny tiny
pencil brush they call this a smudge
brush I'm going to go back in with matt
wood and just line my lower lash line
with that brown because I really wanted
a nice natural look this is kind of what
I wear to work so I don't go too crazy
and just go from the middle out nothing
nothing too crazy make sure you don't
get any excess on your brush for that
because you will get fallout if you
don't tap it off now here's that wing
look any black eyeliner and just kind of
drawn up and tracing that lunch she made
with the remover look at that it looks
like a winged eyeliner like it's so
awesome you just got to make sure you
tap off any excess you have on your
brush roll she'll get fallout like crazy
but yeah love that look that's my new
thing see my little two finger thing
that's what my just learned in the kat
von d sephora video about measuring
where your blush goes that's my
Mirabella blush um that I just got that
I made a video about and the witch call
it the everyday minerals flat flat top
brush that I got in my beauty box five
here is my new color whisper in lust for
blush now going into my Laura Mercier
bronzer using my everyday minerals blush
brush angled blush brush and doing that
3e pattern you make a three on one side
he on the other a little bit darker on
your cheek and it just looks gorgeous I
just started doing that and it's the
best way to contour that I found and
this is the mosaic the Laura Mercier
mosaic it does have a little shimmer to
it but it's not obnoxious so I can kind
of get away with it looks much better in
the summertime going back in with the
blush brush because I don't use it for
blush it's really nice for powder and
blending from Real Techniques and just
kind of blending out make sure you don't
have any harsh lines and lastly my
highlighter completely unnecessary step
but it's really fun this is the new buck
someone that I got it's in Venus and if
you like the
um what's called the high data fit
hiding but it's too late for you try
this buxom one it's a little bit darker
in color than the high beam but it's
just pretty much the same texture
consistency and this is just a clear
gloss this is just a 401 it's nothing
spectacular I just like to use some kind
of clear gloss pull in the head down
finishing it up fluffy fluffy fluffy and
there you go it's all done so i hope you
enjoyed that i hope you learned some
interesting things that maybe you don't
do every day i do things a little bit
different than some of the Guru's on

people may think are not supposed to be
done I just do what I like and what I
