video on the Jacqueline Hill morphe
palette you're tired of seeing this tell
it believe me I am too but I promised
that I would get these dupes out to you
and I do think it's valuable even if you
are not playing on getting the jacket on
or fee palette it's really cool to see
shades from different palettes kind of
next to each other comparing formulas
and things like that at least it's
interesting to me so I hope you find it
interesting as well do want to tell you
a couple of things before we get started
first almost all shades and all pouts
are doable so I'm not saying the
Jacqueline Hill copied all of anybody
I'm not saying anybody copy off of her I
am just saying that these are very
similar shades and speaking of that some
of them are going to be Deuce and some
of them are just going to be close
because on the eye when you're mixing
shadows together sometimes you just end
up with the same look even if the shades
aren't spot-on in the swatch a big
benefit of this video is if you have a
Jaclyn hill palette you can use it for
looks demonstrated with other palettes
that I'm going to show you there's even
one palette where I really don't feel
like you need to purchase it if you own
the Jaclyn hill palette i'm gonna be
showing you that later and also if you
have the up palettes you can decide
whether the Jaclyn hill palette will be
worth it to you or not it should be back
sometime this month which is August of
2017 another thing to keep in mind is
the Jaclyn hill and price program is
much much much less expensive than most
of the shadows that I'm going to show
you today when looking at price per gram
it's even less expensive per gram than
the L'Oreal lepelt nude one which is in
here it is a bit more expensive than L
six can palette it's about the same
price as an elf
ten pan palette when you look at it
price per gram just like I said in my
other video if you love Jaclyn hill or
hate Jacqueline Hill or love morphe or
hate morphe I'd love if you could just
put that on the side for a second and
let's just talk about the quality of
these shadows taking the names off of it
the way this is going to work is we're
going to start with the Jaclyn hill
palette in the top left corner we're
going to talk about each and every of
the 35 shades
starting with in light in light is a
satin finish I shadow and we're going to
be comparing that to shades in the
Loreal palette Urban Decay Naked paced
basics the morphe 35o s palette lorac
mega Pro and the urban decay and make
palate and also from Julia's place and
if you look at those all together you'll
see that they are quite similar some
have more shine some have less shine so
really it's going to depend on how much
shine you like on your eyes which one is
going to be right for you being someone
that likes a lot of punch my least
favorite is the Loreal and my most
favorite is the dubious place now the
white test if you're new to the white
test the reason why I do this is it
gives a hint to how the shadows might
blend and also to where time I do want
to take a second just to compare in
light and beam so you can see the
difference you can see beam is a little
bit brighter a little more yellow toned
wherein light is a little whiter moving
on to beam beam is described as a satin
it is a little frosty ER with a yellow
undertone and we're going to compare
that to the lorac mega Pro that's one
that just came back I'm not sure if it's
still available in the rain release
we're going to compare it to Natasha to
Nona Palace and of course the morphe 35o
s you're going to see the morphe 35o and
the 35 OS come back quite a bit you also
saw some elf palettes there and you can
see that beam really does keep up pretty
well and actually it's very comparable
to the morphe 35o s I actually like
those the best out of all of these
swatches but you got to remember two
swatches aren't everything it really is
the way they apply to the eye but I
really just wanted to show you the tone
this isn't an absolute on the quality of
the shadows and in the white chest you
see that the morphe ones hang on the
best I was pretty impressed and
surprised by that so cream is described
as a matte transition with yellow
undertones
we're going to pair this Divisie are
again morphe comes back the lorac mega
pro 2 and Julia's nubian palette shades
three probably the closest do to this is
the Nubian palette but I feel like you
can use any of these shades as kind of a
dupe I really don't like soap cream it's
probably one of my least favorite shades
in the whole Jacqueline hell palette I
feel like it's just kind of weak it
doesn't build very well and in the white
test you see that silk cream is pretty
much gone and that nubian palette from
julius place does really well I did want
to do another little compare just within
the palette of silk cream and the next
shade which is called M FeO they are
quite different where M FeO has a little
bit more of a reddish tone to it where
silk cream is a little more yellow
orange
here's MFE o by itself it's another one
that I really don't like very much to be
honest we're going to bring in the Too
Faced chocolate bar this time this is
our first appearance but not the last
from the Naked heat by Urban Decay again
you can see the pigmentation issues with
the morphe I do feel like this
translates to the eye as well I feel
like the naked Heat salt is definitely
the closest dupe to the shade naked heat
sauce definitely comes out on top for
the white test this time faint is
described as a shimmer Jacqueline
suggests it as an all-over lid color I
do like faint a lot as a shade but as
you'll see in a moment it's not the most
unique shade this is the first
appearance of the Too Faced natural love
palette it will be back I promise
we've got the elf nude rose gold palette
lorac mega Pro lorac mega pro 3 the
balms new tubes first appearance that's
a messy palette it's well loved and the
Urban Decay Naked 3 palette and you can
see looking at all of those they're all
very very similar you're really not
going to be able to see a whole lot of
difference with these on the eyes I do
really like Saint it's very poppy and
remember that's my preference as a very
poppy shade I'm also a very big fan of
this particular shade in The Naked 3
palette I like the shimmer and shine on
it the white test I really had to scrub
it st. to make it go away the rest
didn't last very well at all definitely
faint came out on top
sissy is one of my favorite shades in
the Jacqueline Hill palette it's a
duochrome gold pink we're bringing in
the two-faced sweet peach this time
along with the visi art sultry muse
I brought it as a hair and blush palette
so I thought that would be interesting
to see the comparison it's not really a
dupe neither is the sultry news one the
sweet peach Just Peachy is probably the
closest dupe to this but sissy really is
a pretty unique shade and in the light
test Jacqueline Hill sissy again comes
out on top the last shade in the top row
is called little lady and little lady is
also named after her sister she calls it
the perfect shade to rock at the office
it's a shimmery wash of neutral it's
very pink and as you can see the sultry
news one from visi art which is a lot
more expensive than this palette is
actually quite similar along with the
sweet peach in Bellini I feel like those
are the closest tubes and in the white
test again Jacqueline held what a lady
is the one that hangs on the longest
moving on to row two this is creamsicle
Jacqueline recommends that this one go
up into your crease to make your eyes
pop it's kind of a mustardy shade rather
than like an orange shade to me I don't
know where she gets creamsicle out of it
but it is very unique
only a few doopy kinds of things in my
collection but really no true dupe even
the one from morphe it really isn't the
same shade you could probably use it for
the same purpose but it is different the
white tests they all hang out really
really well no complaints about any of
those as we get into deeper shades you
are going to see them hang out a lot
tougher butter is the next shade it's a
matte with an orange undertone this is
another one that I really am NOT a big
fan of as far as the performance goes
we're going to bring back the violet
Voss Holy Grail the Anastacio modern
renaissance makes an appearance and then
back into Natasha de Nona and the Tasha
no Nona really isn't a do but I just
wanted to show you it so I thought maybe
you could use it for the same person
purpose but it really is
the Holy Grail talat in transition is
definitely probably the closest to
definitely probably is that a thing it's
not a thing it's the closest to with the
white test you'll see that Anasazi as
modern renaissance hangs out by far the
best out of these shades going into
puter this is described as a neutral
chestnut shade comparing it to a shade
from the Urban Decay Naked heat we bring
in the color drain Queen of Hearts
palette lorac mega Pro 3 the original
lorac mega Pro and of course the morphe
35o M palette bring in visi art again as
well looking at these I would say that
the mega Pro in sepia is probably the
closest I don't know I mean they all
have different little shade variations
in them but they definitely could be
used for the same purpose the mega pro 3
in Maple is also pretty close in my eyes
with the wipe test I would say that the
lorac shadows hang on there pretty well
along with a 3500 M shade my least
favorite name in the palette is pukey
she names after baby puke
even though baby puke isn't brown it
drives me bonkers I don't know why she
didn't ask her sister who has a baby
what color baby puke is before should a
in the shade Pookie but you know it is
what it is that's the only shade name
that truly bothers me she calls it the
ultimate warm brown Anastasio Modern
Renaissance is coming back along with
the morphe 35o M not a whole lot of
dupes in my collection for this one but
I do feel like that morphe shade is
pretty stinking close in the white chest
they all hang out there pretty much
exactly the same here comes cause she
describes it as her favorite shade of
all time it's supposedly her nickname
for Linda I feel like it looks like Hans
ketchup but that's just my opinion
with the swatches it's very very close
to modern Renaissance is a real gar I
feel like that one's really close no
true true dupe here maybe the neutral
mats row to shade to pretty close but I
feel like the pigmentation is definitely
punch here from the Jacqueline Hill
palette you can see just how much
pigment there is in hunts when you do
the white test I mean it is just
staining my arms like crazy compared to
the others firework is a great shade and
one thing I want to mention about these
is that the soils in here the ones that
are really Foyle they have a wet feel to
them it's very similar to the makeup
geek foiled it's very similar to the way
that the julius place for yields feel
the way that the colored rain Queen of
Hearts palette feels it's got that wet
texture to it where when you're looking
at let's say the Urban Decay palette
it's a much drier formula and you can
see that in the effect of the quote
dupes and dupe like things I have for
you it's like the dubious place Nubian
ro2 shade 3 is probably the closest to
this but again no true dupe for it but I
feel like you really could use any of
these shades as a shade to replace fire
work if you needed to but again like
make it heat the natural love palette
you're not going to get that pop of foil
that you do with like the Jacqueline
Hill palette or the 3500 s or the Nubian
2 palette holdin on there the best again
the Jacqueline Hill firework Nubian row
to shape 3 and then the other morphe
palette the nubian 2 also stays there
pretty well queen is one that has a
special place in my heart because I just
love a gold eyeshadow so we're going to
compare that to the very expensive
Natasha Genoa palette and a few others
including the classic lorac Pro palette
strangely enough - Natasha - no no one I
feel like is the closest to the
Jacqueline Hill one and again huge price
difference between these two palettes
in the white sense they all kind of wipe
away I think Jacqueline hill and then
the Saharan palate Senegal really hang
on they're the best obsesses the shade
that Jacqueline Hill says that she went
back to the lab 25 times to get it
perfect I feel very sad that she spent
25 times sending this back to the lab
because I feel like it really isn't that
much different than some other shades in
the palette which I'm going to show you
in just a second
this is another one of those on the eye
they're kind of going to look the same
obsessed definitely seems to have a
little bit more pink in it than
Jacqueline Hills faint but you could
probably use them for the same purpose I
also wanted to show you steel is kitten
on this as well because I feel like
that's such an iconic shade I want to
show you the differences between Felix
obsesses just a tad bit more complex but
I don't really honestly think it was
worth the work that Jacqueline put into
it and the light tests they all kind of
disappear but that's pretty typical for
light shades like this one especially
like shimmery shades just wanted to show
you those two close-up so you can see
obsessed in faint I mean there really is
very little difference between them on
the skin and it makes me sad that she
worked so hard to get such an ordinary
color s B n stands for smoky but natural
it's kind of a little dig people ask but
it's first smoky but natural look
because smoky is not natural and natural
is not smoking you can't really get that
but she felt like this would be a shade
that somebody that asked for smoky but
natural could use
and again not a lot of do penis here
probably the closest is rose quartz from
the mega pro 3 or naked threes trick but
really there aren't any super close
dupes for SBN and with the white test
again jacqueline Hills fbn is the one
that hangs out the best he'll star we
start getting into her plethora of reds
in this palette there's a lot of
different shades of red
I feel like the dupes here are pretty
close compared to some of the other
shades I feel like illustris a little
bit more of a red undertone than some of
these and that shine is really really
bright very similar to the morphe 35o s
and the sultry music I do feel like the
Holy Grail one from violet Voss lamping
is pretty close as well with the white
test jacqueline hill hill ster and the
nubian shade from julius plays hang out
the best red shade number two is called
Roxanne it's a matte it's a dark burnt
red it's named after Jacqueline's middle
name which is Roxanne she says this is
her favorite color in the world she says
it on her lower lashline or outer crease
I am going to bring in the Tarte swamp
Queen here even though there is a little
bit of shimmer in that shade I feel like
the shimmer doesn't transfer to the eye
so I don't think it really matters
looking at these I do feel like they're
all interchangeable the modern
Renaissance is red ochre is probably the
least close but overall I still like
these all these shades are completely
interchangeable with the west test they
all do pretty well but I feel like again
jacqueline hells roxanne comes out on
top one thing i noticed looking at this
palette for like 15 hours is that
there's a lot of shades named after
jacqueline but this one's called jax is
no different and jax is her nickname she
wanted to call it Applejack's but she
didn't want to get in trouble with
kellogg's it is a burgundy matte not too
many dupes for this one we're going to
bring back the Urban Decay Naked heat
palette and the honest alia Modern
Renaissance palette really none of these
are exactly the same but I do feel like
they are interchangeable when using them
in a look you can see the pigmentation
punch that the Jacqueline hell palette
has buzz was picked by more fees owner
Linda it is her favorite crease color
it's a neutral shade for all skin tones
according to Jacqueline
there are some dupes for this shade
nothing exact I feel like the naked heat
is kind of off or in flag oh but I did
want you to see the comparison like the
35o m1 is pretty close along with
masquerades Fulani as we try to take
those off there you notice they all kind
of last pretty much the same
we've got cranapple next and I really
like cranapple the shade I saw it as
being super unique until I started
looking in my collection and realizing I
love shades they were pretty much the
same thing as cranapple so these are all
of them all next to each other and I
feel like they're pretty good dupes mega
pro 3 and pomegranate is definitely more
muted it's not as spoiled as the other
shade but I feel like they could all
pretty much be used interchangeably Jack
O'Neill's cranapple sure does have some
pigment there though as you see the rest
of them have disappeared but that one's
still there
moving on to row 2 we get into the
corner of cool like I like the college
this is royalty it is a very unique
shade and that it's got a little bit of
silver glitter in the background so even
though I have a couple of shades that
look kind of similar that silver glitter
really does set royalty apart from the
Urban Decay electric and the masquerade
bat electric palette though sure does
pack a punch when it comes to pigment
goodness gracious
alright twork this is that bright royal
blue if that's such a thing and I only
have one that even comes close and I
actually like masquerades cheap better
than this one it's just a little bit
poppier
I think the lasting power is better
overall it's just a better shade but
torque will definitely do if you don't
have master hg as they fade down they
say down pretty evenly you've got pretty
much the same remnants left over
hustle is one that I really wanted to
have a dupe for I really thought I had
dupes for it but it turns out I've just
got shades that are similar
so the nude rose gold one and from the
lorac pro those definitely have a little
bit of pink in them the naked 3 mug shot
has a little bit of brown we're a
Jacqueline health hustle is a little
more silver undertone
I was surprised how well the nude rose
gold hung in there compared to the other
ones it's actually a quite a pigmented
shade for a drugstore palette lots of
true dupes for this shade the shade is
not unique at all in my collection I
feel like I could use any of these
shades and it would look exactly the
same on the eyes they all have a bright
shimmer two of them they all have very
similar undertones the lapel at nude one
shade 7 is probably the weakest in
pigmentation but it could definitely be
used in place of nice white test wise
those morphe palettes really do hang on
there as far as pigment along with the
mega pro 3 a brown sugar I feel like is
the next one in line for pigment 24 7 is
my least favorite shade in the palette I
find it very difficult to work with this
is one swipe of it I felt like that was
not enough to get what Jacqueline wanted
you to see with the shade so I did do a
second swipe it's more of an eye shadow
topper for me I really don't like this
shade but for some reason i shadow
toppers are like a thing lately so I
guess she you know she's going with the
trends there are plenty of shades I like
better than this that are a very similar
tone I mean lots and lots of shades the
mega pro 3 and brown sugar is a much
better match for this one Holy Grail and
bat my eyes is a great shade even
chocolate bars hazelnut I really like a
lot it's missing that shine that you get
with the Jaclyn hill where you just get
a little bit of shine with hazelnuts but
I do really like that one better
Jacqueline tells 24/7 is the biggest
bust for me in the palette wiping it
away however you can see very clearly
that 24/7 lasts the best as far as the
pigment two more in this row we've got
chip coming up next it's a matte brown
with a cool purplish undertone
Jacqueline recommends you smoke out the
outer corner and lower lash line with it
I feel like again this is another shade
that is not very
unique loss of shades definitely could
be used instead of it I will say though
I feel like chip is a little bit
different and the other four are pretty
much exactly the same where chip has a
little bit more depth to it feel like
I'm repeating myself over and over again
because I am but the check Jacqueline
Hill one definitely has the most pigment
staying on the skin mocha is the last
one in this row and mocha is a warm
fuzzy Brown Jacqueline recommends
deepening your eye look with this shade
I like violet Voss's brownie points-- is
definitely the closest one to this but I
like how in venutian to Kenya I feel
like it keeps up with that one as far as
pigmentation goes but Kenya is just a
little bit cooler then wiping them away
mocha really does have a beautiful base
to it and I'm very impressed with it
pool party is probably my favorite shade
in the palette I found that to be very
unique very fun to use the pigmentation
is great I broke out my Alice Through
the Looking Glass palette which is one
of my favorite palettes of all time and
then the Judy is place masquerade
palette but you can see that the heads
will roll shade is not the same it's
just got a little bit of sparkle in it
Zola is pretty close though from the
masquerade palette why do we know a way
I feel like Julia's place definitely
beats Jacqueline Hills pool party on
this one you can even still see a little
bit of shimmer there with it I didn't
have any dupes for this one and I forgot
to shoot a little picture of me
swatching with my fingers I just put it
in the corner but this is Jada you can
see that it's very different than what
I've captured from offline it's a lot
lighter than that shade it's very unique
to my collection I have nothing even
close that looks like it divas another
one that I absolutely love that I have
no true dupes for
the GPS plays a shade that I'm showing
here from the Saharan palette is one of
those green brown shades so you're going
to see that brown undertone but it's
definitely the closest Nubian - and the
vida loca those are more green than that
forest green they're more of a true
brighter green but I did want to show
you next to them just so you would have
a basis of comparison if you own either
of those toilets wiping them away again
Jacqueline held Eva has the most pigment
and chance that I thought was going to
be a completely unique shade that I
didn't own anywhere in my collection but
I found one dupe and it's from the lorac
mega Pro - and it is the shade forest
and those are pretty single close as far
as the do penis
I forgot to pause on this one so it goes
away really fast but they stay pretty
much the same Central Park is definitely
one of the least unique shades in this
palette it's a matte cool tone Brown
named after the coffee shop and Friends
and if you look at all of the dupes
side-by-side you can see you really can
use any of these shades in place of
Central Park lorac Pro is espresso is
probably a dead-on dupe from me meet
Matt nudes Matt wood is also really
really close wiping them away you'll see
lorac Pro is espresso and Jacqueline
Hill Central Park definitely still have
the most pigment Sodapop is one that I
think is really fun it looks kind of
like a black but it's actually a super
dark purple bringing in the tort tort
lapel itand the urban decay naked smoky
palette these are ones you haven't seen
it yet but you can see that they are
similar in tone but definitely not the
same I forgot the pause on the white
test for this one as well but Jaclyn
hill and the naked smoky lasted the best
and finally we get to the last shade
which is abyss and it is the black
that's in this palette and of course we
all have a million blacks going around
if we have eyeshadow palettes and
collections of makeup and things so here
are all of my blacks in one place at
least all the ones that I could find for
this video so there's tons of them for
some reason my meet matrimony one did
not swatch well at all I don't know
what's going on with that but definitely
Naked basics crave and the tartlet
fashionista and Saharan Chad I feel like
are the best ones in here jacqueline
hills abyss is kind of near the end of
that as far as the pigmentation goes
it's a good black but it's not a great
black in my opinion if you're looking
for more of a smokey eye you're going to
go for the tartlets and make the basics
or the meet matrimony if you're looking
for just black on your eye this is a
hair and Chad and Jacqueline hills abyss
are going to be better for you before I
let you go if you didn't notice there
are some pallets that have more dupes in
them than others and I wanted to show
you those just together so the first one
we're going to examine is the morphe 35o
s palette and you can see there are
quite a few dupe shades there six of
them that I was able to find the Jaclyn
hill one I definitely
to the 35 OS I feel like the formula is
better it's more pigmented it's easier
to work with it's less likely to blend
away if you're trying to choose between
the Jacqueline hell over 35 OS I
definitely recommend the Jacqueline Hill
I liked the formula better or you can
get one of the 25 pan palettes from
morphe it's the same formula as the
Jacqueline Hill and you notice the 35 om
palette has a lot of do so many do you
own the Jaclyn hill palette you probably
don't want to get the morphe 35o m
there's a lot of shade they're very
close to each other in that palette I
really don't like it just because there
are so many shades that are so similar
and if you notice the pigmentation of
the Jaclyn hill is definitely better I
feel like it's punchier I feel like they
work better I feel like they plan better
so if you have the choice I would go for
the Jacqueline Hillier the 25 pan
palettes over any of the other morphe
palettes
now this is one that I find very very
interesting this is the Urban Decay
Naked heat palette and this came out
just before Jacqueline's palette came
out so I don't think that this was done
on purpose but I truly feel in my heart
if you own the Jacqueline Hill morphe
palette you do not need Urban Decay's
naked heat I actually like Jacqueline
health palette better as far as
performance blend ability lasting power
then been naked heat to make it heat is
a good palette but I feel like the
Jacqueline Hill palette has more to
offer it's less expensive and I feel
like the shade performed just as well
it's not better than the Urban Decay
Naked heat palette the two shades I feel
like you're really missing out on if you
missed the naked heat is lumber and then
also ember they're very very unique
shades with fun little shifts but if
you're not dying over this two shades
you're paying about twice as much for
the Urban Decay Naked heat palette and
getting so much less product this is an
interesting one
the Juvia space the harem palette has
quite a few doopy kinds of shade and it
shades in it I actually like little lady
better than Lulu which is shocking for
me because UVs place is my favorite
eyeshadow brand I have to tell you
though I feel like this is a harem
palette and the Jacqueline helped
palette have different things to offer
and then if you own both I don't think
that you would be too upset there are
also a few dupes in the lorac Pro
palette these are those next to each
other pewter and Hussle are kind of
pushing it as far as dupes but
do feel like I like the Jacqueline Hill
morphe palette better than this specific
lorac Pro palette I like the lorac Pro
formula a lot and overall I like it
about the same as the morphe Jacqueline
Hill palette if not a little bit more
than the morphe Jacqueline Hill palette
but the original lorac Pro is my least
favorite as far as the punchiness of it
if you like a more subtle look you'll
probably want to go with the pro though
I again like that bright bold punchy
look I thought it was kind of funny that
the juvie s place masquerade palette
it's such a bold bright poppy palette
has so many dupes in the Jaclyn hill
talent they're not exact dupes I do feel
like owning both of them you'll be very
happy because there is such difference
and the GPS place masquerade palette is
so so fun and I feel like the Purple's
are different in that that Jacqueline
hell has that little silver sparkle but
I like Chi better than twerk pool party
and Zola so it can be used
interchangeably salami and buns I like
them both and Giza and light I like G's
a little bit better than in light I like
both palettes and I'm happy to have both
of them and finally we have the honest
hacia Modern Renaissance calluses I did
have five quote doopy kinds of shades in
here I did want to show you I do a feel
like the modern renaissance is easier to
work with and the Jacqueline Hill
palette I find it easier to blend but I
feel like the Jacqueline hell palette is
just a tad bit more pigmented you'll see
that pukey and raw Sienna pukey is
definitely more pigmented than raw
Sienna but again I feel like there's
enough difference between the two
palettes that you wouldn't be too upset
if you owned both but the price per gram
difference between these two palettes is
ridiculous the price program on
Anastacio palette is over $5 per gram
where you're looking at about 75 cents
per gram for the Jaclyn hill palette so
the huge difference as far as price per
gram so if you were on the fence about
the modern renaissance and you liked a
few of the shades you might want to pick
up the Jaclyn hill palette instead
because you do get five very very close
shades so that is it for this epic video
I hope that you enjoyed it I this is the
video I have worked the hardest on of
any video on my channel I will
never be doing this for a 35 pan
eyeshadow palette again in my life if
you made it this far I do appreciate you
watching and I hope you enjoyed it
because my heart and soul went into this
video so much work went into this video
and finding these dupes for you so I
hope that you found it helpful if you
did definitely make sure you subscribe
to the channel I hope you're having a
wonderful day or evening wherever you
are and mad love to you and I will see
you in a video soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
