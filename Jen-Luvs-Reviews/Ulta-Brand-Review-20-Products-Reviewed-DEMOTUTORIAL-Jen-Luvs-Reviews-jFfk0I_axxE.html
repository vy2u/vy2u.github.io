brand review I am so happy that this is
finally here I have been trying these
products and trying these products for a
few weeks now making sure that I have a
good solid opinion about everything
before I give you my full review because
I never want to recommend something to
you that I don't feel like I have fully
tried and if there's anything in here
that don't feel like that fully tried I
will make sure I let you know let me
tell you how this is going to work I am
going to show you a demo of how I got
this look using all Ulta brand products
except for one but I'm going to explain
why and then after I do the demo and
show you how the products work I'll go
into a full review of each product
including products that I didn't fit
into my look today but I still tried and
I still want to let you know how I feel
about them so let's go ahead and jump in
to the demo so you can see how these
products apply to the face sometimes I
and when I wake up in the morning I
can't believe this whole words crazy
with the motion in a thickest comment
open don't know how to find it really
put in you I've helped get me through
they say I'm crazy but if I'm crazy I'm
crazy
then if we all go crazy
is it crazy
that I lost my mind again misplaced it
never
buteven wanna win on a PTO Isaac the
inspiration that I need to keep my soul
alive in his crazy
they say I'm crazy
but if I'm crazy
we all crazy
they wanna go crazy
crazy
uh-uh
right now
No
I'm crazy for you you would have won
that I'm in on a ring
when I saw you then I'm better half
wanna love you every morning
since it to my brain baby come on
nice man
out of control every second when I pick
up my phone again another story about a
person that the cover man is messing
with and a me what's the message of a
terrorist and in the ocean is a war
still is killing fish the corporation's
who are buying up the politics we lost
they say I'm crazy
I'm crazy I'm crazy
we all want
is crazy
all right
now and everybody singing one
in the air you can feel it coming
I'm crazy and it goes on in and out at
home sometime
I hope you enjoyed that and I hope that
you were able to get an idea of how
these products work in action now I'm
going to give you my personal thoughts
on everything I did not buy a face
primer I don't know if Alta has a face
primer they did not have one in the
store for me to purchase so this is the
Demi matte foundation and if you've been
watching my channel for a little while
you know how much I love this foundation
it's got a really nice lasting power I
love the finish that leaves on my skin I
love that it's buildable you can go from
a lighter coverage to a nice medium
coverage don't feel like it builds up to
full coverage I do have normal skin so I
can't say how it reacts to oily skin or
dry skin but for me personally works
really really really well lasting power
is great and yeah I really like it I
have no complaints about this I love the
squeezy tube I love the pump I just love
this I love this product this will be a
repurchase guaranteed next we have the
Ulta eye primer yes this is a story here
okay so you may have noticed in the demo
that I use the Ulta eyeprimer on one eye
and I use Urban Decay's even on the
other side and there's a reason for that
the reason why is because the formulas
are actually very very similar they
perform very similar on the eye this
one's a little pinky err this one's a
little yellow ear but I don't think it
really makes too much of a difference in
the way that it performs because it's
such a light shade like it's it's kind
of hard to tell and you're covering it
up with a bunch of eyeshadow what really
is nice is the does muted out
discoloration so that you have a nice
blank canvas to start on so let me get
my notes because I like to look things
up and when I see something that seems
to be almost the same I have to look it
up so I did the first ingredient in both
of these products is called ISO dodecane
which is it seems to be closely related
to paraffin it's kind of acts like a
silicone but it's not a silicone that is
the first ingredient in both of these
products
the next ingredient in this is mica
which is for coloring the coloring and
this is talc but it's way down on the
list the next four ingredients are the
same but they are in slightly different
orders and then this one starts going
off where it's got two ingredients that
are not contained in this but if you
kind of look at all of the ingredients
that are in each one this one has 80%
ingredients that are in this one this
one does have more ingredients total so
only 60% of the ingredients are found in
this but man are they similar they are
so similar a couple of things to keep in
mind that I think is better about the
Ulta than the Eden and Eden is my holy
grail this is like hurting my heart to
even say this about eating because Eden
is my baby okay but just so you know
Eden does have talc in it and talk is
something that some people do have
sensitivities to so if you haven't been
able to use Eden this may be a good
alternative another thing is this
includes an ingredient that's derived
from lanolin and lanolin is a sheep's
wool product so if you have since if you
have sensitivities the sheep wool then
this would be something you wouldn't be
able to use but you would be able to use
this because it's not contained in this
so in a way this one seems a little bit
better because it doesn't include those
things the people the sensitive eyes may
not be able to use neither of these are
vegan they both include animal products
they both include beeswax and this one
has the lanolin product in it but
overall I mean I recommend both of them
but this one's like half the price so
I'm very sad that I'm probably never
gonna buy a tin again and it's like
thinking about that it just breaks my
heart you know I mean but this little
this little beautiful packaging I don't
need it if this is going to do the same
thing you know what I'm saying so yes
huge win there so so far huge win here
huge win here okay next up brows this
brow product is called the ultra slim
brow pencil - in dark brown it's the
same format as the Anastasia brow Wiz
it's a very very thin twist up pencil it
is different than the brow Wiz in that
it is more waxy you can feel it going on
you can feel it being thick and heavy as
you put it on the end effects I feel
like are pretty similar to the brow Wiz
but the application process isn't as
nice so if that bothers you you may not
want to get this you may want to stick
with the brow Wiz or the L'Oreal whether
the Loreal brow definer is very very
similar to the brow Wiz but this one I
would definitely I don't think I'm going
to repurchase this because I like those
so much better but it's similar it's
just that whole waxy thing I don't
particularly like the brow gel though I
like better than that honest Asya one
Stasi oh one it makes my brows kind of
crunchy and it smells really strong of
alcohol this one does not have a strong
smell and it doesn't leave my brows
crunchy so that makes me super duper
uber happy and it holds my brows in
place so this one is a definite
recommend for eyeshadow I use this
little no-name palette it is a gift with
purchase a lot of times Ulta stuff when
you buy a certain amount they'll give
you a bag of goodies or you know they'll
send you gifts with purchase so this is
one of those things I wanted to see if
this formula was similar to the Miss Jen
fabulous palette I will link my review
of the Miss Jen fabulous palette down
below this is also by Ulta brand it was
a collaboration with youtuber Jenny Fox
I'll link that down below if you want to
check it out but I did find that this
eyeshadow palette performed very
similarly in that the application of it
was actually kind of nice pretty easy to
apply especially the matte shades
believe it or not usually maps are a
little trickier but I actually kind of
like the mattes I like them better than
the shimmers because I feel like the
shimmers don't ever give you that punch
of shimmer like you get with a lot of
shimmer eyeshadow products you know
where you really see that shot in your
eyes I mean no matter how much I build
it no matter how much I pack it on if I
use my finger if I you know I haven't
tried them wet because I'm scared I
don't typically use eyeshadows wet
because I'm always scared I'm going to
ruin my product but just finger
application brush application it just
doesn't pack a shimmery punch like I
personally enjoy but I mean it's a nice
day to day palette if you're just
looking for something easy to use to go
to school or go to work this one will be
fine good maybe five to six hours before
it has significant veining but after
that five to six hour mark it does start
fading significantly by the end of the
day it's relatively gone off of the eyes
depending on your eye look and it's not
cute by the end of the day so just kind
of keep that in mind that they are less
expensive eyeshadows and they perform
like less expensive eyeshadows in that
way but unlike like some Revlon and
eyeshadows and things you can get a
really pretty look out of these this
eyeshadow palette the highlight in here
I use that as the inner corner highlight
and also the highlight on my face I
enjoy this as a highlighter same thing
about the lasting power lasting power is
not great but it is very very pretty so
I did enjoy using it but what I say yes
go out and make sure you get all two
shadows no I would not say that eyeliner
for
my upper lashline I use the Ulta a gel
eyeliner in black out I'm not a big fan
of using pencil eyeliners on my upper
lash line I typically enjoy pen liners
or liquid liners sometimes gel pod
eyeliners these aren't my favorite
because I can't really do a good wing
with a pencil and I like to do a wing
all the time but if you don't and you
like a pencil liner I would recommend
this one for an upper lash line it
reminds me a lot of the Urban Decay
eyeliner pencils in that it goes on very
very smooth but on the lower lash line
it does tend to seep down my eyes like
down under here and either it goes away
or just looks terrible by the end of the
day a lot of times I'll go like this on
my eyes throughout the day for one
reason or another
so sometimes it's there on the bottom
lash line by the end of the day and
sometimes it's just smudged and looks
horrible so definitely don't recommend
this for the waterline but if you like a
for upper lash line it'll definitely
work for you in my opinion with my
normal lids I did get this one as part
of the gift with purchase this is the
dual ended eyeliner pencil I didn't like
this one at all this one is one of those
if you've ever bought an eyeliner pencil
where you have to like drag it and push
on your skin in order to get it to apply
that is this it's terrible
do not recommend the pencil at all
horrible application really bad the
mascara is just okay this is the
ultimate Volume Mascara it's just fine
it's not a great mascara it's not a bad
mascara it's just fine gives a little
bit of length a little bit of volume but
nothing where I'm like yes this is a
great mascara and there are a lot of
really great drugstore mascaras this is
definitely not one of them for me if you
already have long or full lashes you may
really enjoy this but for me with my
short stubby lashes sparse lashes I
definitely don't recommend I've also
tried the lengthening one I find that
one it really gives me that like a
little bit longer but they look like
little sticks on my lids and I don't
particularly like that look very much so
I don't recommend the lengthening one
either unless you already have a lot of
lashes but yeah I didn't like this at
all flaking was not not a problem
and I don't usually have smudging on my
mascara I only have ever had smudging so
I can't speak to that on people that
have had smudging on their mascara but
flaking was not a problem with this and
removal wasn't bad either removal was
relatively easy oh when I was talking
about the foundation I forgot to talk
about the
the blending sponge this is the large
blending sponge really like this a lot I
was surprised because a lot of times
when you buy something that's not the
beauty blender or the Real Techniques
one it's hard as a brick that was what I
was expecting and it's not it's actually
really soft these are old I don't use
these anymore they're actually from my
empties drawer it's definitely softer
than the Real Techniques I do feel like
the beauty blender is just a tad bit
softer it has a tad bit more give but
it's really nice it's pretty close it's
definitely closer than the Real
Techniques as far as how it works and
also how it feels I do like the shape I
like this little balance II side and
thanks Niemi it's kind of a little
flatter than the beauty blender and I
also kind of like the pointy side too
for concealer I didn't buy a concealer
from Ulta brand but I do like it to use
with concealer I just didn't use
concealer today because they didn't have
an older brand concealer but definite
recommend on the Beauty sponge which I
completely shocked my completely shot me
it's really good moving on to face
products I tried the ultimate bronzer in
warm I don't like this it does not show
up on my skintone at all so if you're a
lighter skin tone this may show up
better on you if you're deeper just
forget it it's it's not going to show up
on you this doesn't show up on me hardly
at all I mean I tried to put on for the
demo just to show you even though I knew
it wasn't going to do anything I just
want to show you how it applied if
you're new to bronzer though and you are
of my skin tone or lighter this may
actually be a really good bronzer for
you because it's not going to let you
get out of control to the point where
you look really crazy so this might be a
fun one to play with if you know you
just want something that will give you a
little bit of a light bronze so that you
can kind of experiment and try things
out but I don't really enjoy it it is
very soft it feels fantastic it just
doesn't do anything and then for blushes
I this is the thing about blushes is a
lot of times there's variation in the
different formulas and the different
shades of blush within a certain line so
I only tried one because if I tried more
than one it would take me forever to
test them all out so this one is in the
shade Bella and I really like this one
this is just the Velvet blush lasting
power was a good solid six hours before
it was significantly faded which is
pretty good for a blush it's not great
but it's pretty good I mean it's not
terrible there's definitely worse
blushes out there but it's not the best
but I really like the way that it
applied and if you don't mind
it not lasting beyond your typical
worker school day it's a nice blush and
I would definitely recommend it this one
on the other hand did not work as well
for me but it might be due to the shade
I really feel like I need to try this
more this one I think jury's still out
this is the mineral blush in the shade
tulip it goes on my skin like I can see
it on my skin but it only lasts about
two hours before I can't see it at all
but again that might have to do with the
fact that this is just a really really
light shade of blush if you have
experience with either of these formulas
of blush I would love to hear about in
the comments below let's do collective
brand of makeup awesomeness on these
altar products if you have experience
with them let's all comment down below
read down below so we can learn more
about this and become even more educated
because I'm just one person and the
collective brain is gigantic
so definitely read the comments below
for more information because I know
people are going to come down with a lot
a lot of opinions Oh
face powder face powder I use the ultra
mineral setting powder I really like
this stuff a lot I don't like it quite
as much as my bare minerals or my Besame
but it's still very very nice it just
takes a little more work to blend out
the powder than those but it's not bad
at all I also use this to blend out the
deepness of my eyeshadow where it was up
in my crease and it was up in the crease
and it was up there and it was just a
little too dark so I used a little bit
of this to kind of calm it down so this
is really nice for use with that and I
can't speak to whether it sticks to dry
patches or whether it keeps oil at bay
all I can say is that it works really
nice on my skin I really like it a lot
on my normal skin okay for lip products
the lip pencil I used was the dual ended
one this is the lip liner I do feel like
it is better than the eye liner but it's
still very thick it doesn't go on super
easily like it you still have to kind of
rub to get it on there it's not the most
pleasant product to use but it'll get
the job done I wish that I had used the
deeper color when I was doing the demo
today
I had had an original plan and then I
changed my mind mid mid demo so if I had
had my original if I had had this in my
mind when I did it I probably would have
put this on but you know changed my new
things so but anyway it's not a bad lip
liner but it's like a typical pencil not
very great quality lip liner I don't
recommend this one
it's
mmm the liquid lipsticks this these come
as a set I really don't like this one
this one is in the shade elusive it's
really difficult to work with slips
around all over the place gets on your
teeth like it requires more than one
coat it's just really really really bad
I do really like these though this one
is in bombshell and this one is in
bestie these are a lot more opaque that
go on really really nice the formula
overall dries down to being a little bit
dry but it's not over drying and they
are kiss proof and transfer proof
they're very nice once they dry down
just while they're drying down just be
careful not to get it on your teeth this
is actually the second time I film this
video because the first of my film that
I had lipstick on my teeth so just be
aware of that learn from my mistake but
these two are really nice so I'd be
curious to try more liquid lipsticks in
the line that are the lighter shades at
this point I cannot recommend the deeper
shades at least this one this one's
really bad and then finally for what I
use today the Ulta nail polish and I
actually really like this for a
drugstore nail polish of course I have
brands that are more expensive that I
like more than this the poor smite
juleps are my favorites I have some
other brands that I really like they're
you know $15 a bottle ish and this one
performs to me like an Essie polish like
an OPI polish and it's a lot cheaper
than those it goes on in two coats like
you saw it lasts about two to three days
without a chip which is pretty typical
for me for an Essie polisher and OPI and
I really like it a lot for for what it
is for the price point on it for a
drugstore brand I definitely recommend
trying this especially the shade of
course there's definitely variations in
nail polish shades as far as the
performance of them but this one was
really really nice I like it a lot I
don't know if I'll be buying more of
them just because I have ones formulas
that I like better than this but if you
don't have a very big nail polish
collection and you just want a really
pretty new shade I would recommend
trying one of these out now moving on to
the brushes that I use today and there's
one that I forgot to use that's not good
so must be why I use it these are gift
with purchase brushes there's a blush
brush and an eyeshadow brush I don't
like either of these I don't like the
way the blush brush is cut it's cut very
flat on the top which makes it really
difficult to pick up a lot of
product and to blend it on the skin
evenly it just it kind of places the
blush and then you it's hard to get it
to blend just because it's cut really
weirdly for a blush brush I don't like
it at all and then this one is a very
flat brush so it's difficult for me to
pick up the Ulta shadows with it because
I had to keep going dipping on and
dipping on dipping on dipping on and
trying to get it to build and build and
build and build and it just it's a pain
in the tush so definitely don't really
like those but I did like these a lot
I'd be curious to try more also brushes
they remind me a lot of Real Techniques
brushes actually this one is the crease
brush and I feel like it's it's you know
it's not a blending brush it's a crease
brush it's good for going up in the
crease but they didn't have an alter
blending brush so I just use this for
blending as well but I like it more for
packing on color than I do for blending
it's really really nice very easy to use
I like the little dig in the middle of
it it feels very comfortable to hold and
it's very nice I also like the contour
brush a lot it feels good it doesn't
have to be just used for contour you can
use this for blush as well you can use
it for bronzer it's just a really nice
brush it's very soft and it does what
it's supposed to do and again I like
this little pinch in there it just feels
good to hold now moving onto products
that I did not show in the demo but I
tried and I wanted to let you know about
these are the ultimate lipsticks this
one came as a gift with purchase this
one was bought separately this one is in
the shade blooming and this is mulberry
blooming looks like that and mulberry
looks like that
and I like them both very much they're
beautiful shades the lasting power is
not good at all the lasting power is an
hour maybe I mean anytime you you wipe
your lips at all or touch your lips or
lick your lips or anything they're gonna
disappear they don't have good lasting
power but they go on very smooth very
opaque and they're not terrible they're
just not good so I don't think I'll be
purchasing any more of these I also got
this as the gift with purchase this is
the mineral lip gloss in the shade sheer
opal I'd be curious to try more of more
products from this formula it's very
interesting it gives it that metallic
your lips this metallic shine that's
really popular right now it feels very
thick but it's not sticky
this shade is just really light for me
so I don't really enjoy it but if there
was a deeper shade of this I may really
like this
so yeah it's layering it over top of
things does not work it kind of gets
lost in other lip products but on its
own it may be really really nice on the
right person or with the right shade so
I'm sad to say that these did not work
for me these are the eye crayons I got
birthday girl and white wedding and
these were actually recommended to me by
someone that works at Ulta that I really
really like a lot and she said she loves
them and I don't do they don't know why
I don't know why they work for her and
they don't work for me for me they go on
really patchy she said that they
replaced the NYX pencils for her these
will not replace the NYX pencils for me
just because they go on so patchy I
don't find that eye shadow goes on very
nicely over them I found a little bit of
creasing just not good on these maybe I
got the wrong ones maybe she has shade
that she likes that I didn't buy but
these were definitely a no for me and
then the last thing I wanted to
recommend that I've been using for years
are these dual tipped applicators the
ones with the pointy end they're really
nice for cleanup application sometimes
people will use tape here too to
separate here so that you don't get
shadow below a certain point I
personally don't like the way that tape
feels so this is a nice alternative for
me so I'll dip this in Bioderma but you
can use any kind of makeup remover that
you have and just let's just you know
clean up here and kind of bring it down
to clean up any extra that you got a
little eye shadow that you got a little
too low this is also really nice if you
get mascara on your lid after you've
applied your eye shadow just using a dry
q-tip to kind of pull away that mascara
you don't want to smudge it though so
you want it to be a little bit dry
before you start trying to get it off of
there but it works really really well
and I love these little q-tips this is
my favorite brand that I found of these
is the Ultra brand so that is it for my
