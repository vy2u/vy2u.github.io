the Urban Decay Naked Heat
palette this is probably one of the most
requested videos I've gotten recently
I'm about to leave for vacation in a
couple of days I just got this palette
yesterday but I wanted to get it to you
because I know but you all want to know
the truth about this palette and I'm
about to give it to you if you've never
been to one of my review videos before
they are quite long feel free to skip
ahead to your favorite parts in the
description down below first I'm going
to talk about what you get where you can
get it how much it is the value of it
will go a little bit into the
ingredients in the product and then
we'll do a swatches demo and then I will
give you my full review so let's go
ahead and talk about what this palette
is so the naked heat palette is the
exact same setup as the other naked
palettes you get twelve rectangular
shape shadows you get this large mirror
here and you also get a double sided
brush none of that is new to the naked
range you'll notice just like the other
naked palettes they're set up from light
to dark ish usually that's the way they
set things up along with the eyeshadow
palette in this collection they do have
lipsticks and liners but I didn't want
to spend all of that to be completely
honest and speaking of spending on this
I do want to thank the folks over in the
super chat after I posted on Instagram
about this that I bought this myself I
realized I remembered I was going to use
super chat money for this so thank you
so much those you and super chat who
allowed me to purchase this because I am
way over budget for tuned like way over
these names right here are the people
that purchase this palette for me so
thank you so much for your donation
super chat will be enabled probably
again in the fall I'm going to quote
urban decay on this it says this is the
most shade driven Naked palette urban
decay has ever created and I completely
agree with that these shades in this are
very monochromatic you've got read and
read and read and read and lots of red
there's just red everywhere I really
truly believe in my heart this palette
could not have come out two or three
years ago before the worm trend hit
people would have looked at this
been like oh my gosh is going to make my
eyes look bloody but because warm is so
on-trend I don't think people are really
looking at it is bloody anymore they're
just looking at it is very very warm of
course we do have a couple shades that
aren't red you've got these four over
here we've got one that leans a little
bit purple here but overall we're
dealing with red here there are seven
matte shades in here and five shimmer
shades here is a shimmer and then we've
got Matt Matt Matt shimmer Matt shimmer
shimmer Matt Matt Matt shimmer over here
I was lucky enough to get this on the
Urban Decay website when they had a very
very short time presale I do believe
this palette is going to be permanent
they haven't talked about it being
limited-edition in any way and all the
rest of the naked palettes are permanent
- they're aligned so I would expect this
one to be as well the release date for
this palette is June 30th on Urban
Decay's website and then it's a four and
auto online on July 10th and then in
stores on July 13th I'm assuming it will
also be available other places that
Urban Decay is sold now we're going to
talk about how this product was made so
it is bulk made in the United States
with us and/or imported ingredients now
that is a problem for lorac and that
lorac cannot guarantee the suppliers of
their suppliers that they are cruelty
free but Urban Decay says this Urban
Decay is a cruelty free brand and is
committed to ending animal testing we do
not test our products on animals nor do
we allow others to test on our behalf
additionally we require our suppliers to
certify that the raw materials use and
the manufacture of our products are not
tested on animals our brand is certified
by PETA as cruelty-free so so far we're
good on the cruelty free lane until we
hit the fact that they are owned by
L'Oreal which is not a cruelty free
company so depending on how far you take
your cruelty free Ennis you may say this
is a cruelty free product you may not
because the money eventually trickles up
to L'Oreal who is not cruelty free so
it's up to you what you want to say
about that as far as value there's a
little weirdness on the box that I think
is a misprint each pan is supposed to be
1.3 grams but also point 0 5 ounces but
if you calculate point 0 5 ounces it's
actually 1 point for one
Rams the rest of the naked palettes are
1.40 one gram so I'm assuming that the
1.3 grams is a misprint I know that's a
bunch of numbers just thrown out at you
but basically it says that it's got less
in it when I personally think it was
just a misprint and it has a little bit
more so we're going to go with the one
point 401 grams because that's the same
as the rest of the naked palettes so
that makes this palette at a $54 palette
it makes it three dollars and 19 cents
per gram am I crazy or you make a
palette used to be $50 and then there
were 52 and now there's 54 that's what
my memory serves me correct me if I'm
wrong or please validate me if you think
I'm right I think the prices are going
up a little bit with value these are
more expensive than Tarte and to faith
but they are less expensive than lorac
and honest Asya they kind of fall in the
middle of the range of their price
points of similar brands now just a
little bit about ingredients the first
ingredient is stalks if you don't like
that you don't want this the second
ingredient is something that's actually
a really good skin care ingredient I
don't know how much accounts for a
powder product but it's called Catholic
and capric triglyceride it's a skin
balancing ingredient so I don't know how
that affects the shadows but it is known
to be a good ingredient there are no
parabens in this product it does use
phenoxyethanol which some people are
sensitive to they do have that long list
of pigments and some of them are not lip
safe including ultramarine ferric
ferrocyanide chromium oxide greens and
chromium hydroxide greens you want to
know which ones you could tap into the
center of your lip for a little bit of
highlight you have to contact Urban
Decay directly to find out which one's
of these shadows do not contain those
ingredients one thing I was really
shocked about is that there's no carmine
in this product carmine is made from
crushed beetles
so that makes product not vegan it is a
red pigment that is used all the time
and red lipsticks and red eye shadows
and red makeup in general I'm shocked
not to find carmine so I have some
messages into urban decay I don't have a
direct contact at urban decay so I've
put in some social media requests to
find out if this palette is in fact
vegan it seems to be vegan which would
be great for the vegans out there
there's
some note at the hexyl palmitate i know
some of the people who watch my videos
don't use palm oil because of
environmental reasons so there's no
attacks will palmitate in this which is
also a really good thing so now it's
time to get into the swatches so i'm
gonna go ahead and show you those right
now while you immediate pink this bit is
preaching in suffocating waiting and
always has it tastings kryptonite
desires that my heart of fire
and forbidden boys can stay still don't
my heart afire I hope you found those
swatches helpful let's go ahead and get
into the demo of how I got this look
today I've been getting some critiques
lately that I do the same look over and
over I never step out of my comfort zone
so today we stepped out of the box a
little bit I figured this naked he
thought was a good way to step out of
the box I also you'll see a very fun
surprise what's not going to be
surprised I'm about to tell you I also
use the shadow as all of my cheek
products today actually came from the
naked heat palette so you'll see how I
use those so I'm going to show you that
now
all right so let's get this party
started with some Urban Decay primer
potion in Eden this is one that I really
liked because it mutes out some of the
discoloration in my lids it's not quite
as much as mixes pencil in milk but it's
enough you can see that there is some
coverage there we're going to go ahead
into a transition with the shade sauce
and I found that this has a lot of
pigmentation so you really don't need a
lot on your brush in order to get that
color on your skin at least for my skin
tone I'm going to try my hardest only to
use the brush that came with the palette
but I am going to dip into some other
brushes later just because I felt like I
really needed to let's go into dirty
talk I'm springing that right above the
transition and I'm just kind of winging
it out a little bit kind of making that
triangle shape on the outer corner and
bringing it in a little further than I
normally do just to make it a little
more dramatic we're going to go into
ashes now which is a matte like reddish
purple shade and bring that into the
crease this is not a cut crease but it's
about as close as I get to a cut crease
I'm just bringing that over all the way
over my lid and then winging it out just
a little bit on the outer corner
and then back into chaser this is just a
blend out the brow bone this shade is
not very pigmented at all so really this
is pretty much for me just as good as a
clean brush now this shade lumber is the
one that I had the most hope for it is
absolutely beautiful in a swatch but on
the lid it's not as punchy as I had
hoped
now the scores on the outer corner
you'll see that there really isn't a
whole lot of difference between lumber
and scorched on the lid they kind of
muddy together a bit now alex is a nice
very subtle highlight color there is
some pigmentation to it but it is
definitely not a super poppy light color
for the inner corner so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to put some six-plus
to show you the difference of when you
spray and wet the brush in order to
apply the shadows and you'll see it
definitely pops a little more I'm just
taking a clean fluffy brush to blend
what I've done so far kind of looks okay
I like my looks really Bobby and it just
wasn't giving it to me so let's go back
in the lumber and you'll see there's a
huge difference between a wet brush and
the dry brush and then back into Scorch
trying to brighten that up and you can
see that one pops quite a bit more as
well but I'm still not super impressed
with the way the shadows are working so
that is the end of the basic I look and
this is the look with a lashes and liner
and lipstick look I'm wearing here by
the way is f bomb and I've got some Pat
McGrath gold in the center as of looking
at the palette I was like ooh I wonder
if I could use this for my cheeks too so
I'm using he devil as a blush and as you
can see you only need the tiniest
tiniest a little bit and it actually
works better on the second cheek because
I had already gotten off a lot of the
products on my right cheek it just takes
a little bit of work but it works out
and then it's a low blow I was going to
try to use that as a contour but I don't
know if it really works as a contour it
was just more fun for this look I kind
of works I guess it'll depend on your
skin tone whether this will work for you
or not and then now I'm rubbing into out
as my highlight and I actually really
like this is a highlighter I like it
better as a highlighter than I do as an
eyeshadow it just gives a really nice
glow to the cheeks it's very very pretty
so this is the finished look on SIA and
you know just a little posing and
fluffing because that's what the beauty
gurus do so I figured I'd fluff and pose
that's the thing to do apparently and
overall I like the look it's definitely
not my favorite look on me personally
but I think it came out pretty good I'm
happy with it
now you have seen how these perform
maybe made some judgments based on the
swatches in the demo about what you
think about this palette as I was
editing this video I kind of had a
brainstorm of an idea I thought that
Korra from vintage or tacky did a little
bit of comparisons between different
palettes so I'm going to go ahead and do
that for you with a few palettes the
first one we're going to compare is the
Anastacio modern renaissance palette
there really isn't a ton of similarities
between these but I do want to compare
some of the shades I also want to show
you the color drain Queen of Hearts
palette this palette is coming back I
think in the fall late summer early fall
and it's a very very popular palette
among people that like very pigmented
poppy look so I want to do a comparison
there and then also the violet Voss holy
grail palette there are actually a lot
of similarities between the naked heat
and the violet Voss holy grail palette
I'll show you those in just a moment and
finally there are some comparison shades
with the naked heat and the hardest Pro
palette so let's go ahead and get into
those we're just going to go from left
to right on the naked heat palette
starting off with ounce we're going to
go ahead and compare that to tempera
from the a BH mono renaissance palette
as well as Vermeer from the honest alia
palette and then crystal from violet
Voss I wanted to do both tempera and
Vermeer because tempera is a matte and
premier is a shimmer and else is a
shimmer so just wanted to kind of give
you a comparison that if you mix those
you'll probably get the same shade as
you can see the shimmer is quite a bit
weaker on the Urban Decay palette than
it is on the Anasazi a palette so if you
like a ship a weaker shimmer you're
going to go for Urban Decay if not
you're going to want to get either the
Anastasio or the violet ball and I'm
going to go ahead and do the wipe test
for these because I want to show you
what would happen if you would do over
blend them or if it'll give you a hint
to lasting power as is typical for light
shades they all disappear except for you
really can still see just a little bit
of crystal left we're going to go ahead
and move on to the second shade which is
chaser which is my least favorite shade
in the urban decay palette and we're
going to compare that to air from
colored rain Betty from violet Voss and
bold from
part of course they're not exact dupes
but you can kind of get the sense of the
pigmentation you can see the urban decay
is definitely the weakest and
pigmentation and air from colored brain
is definitely the strongest but you can
get similar looks out of these shades
and with the white test for these you'll
see that the Urban Decay one is pretty
much gone where the other three hang in
there pretty well the third shade is
soft and we'll compare that to burnt
orange from Anasazi Oh Royal Prerogative
from coloured raine and are you kidding
me from violet balls and they're pretty
much all exactly the same there are
deserts very small variations between
these but they're all pretty much the
same shade they're all very good quality
- I like all these shades do you need
all four now with the white test you'll
see they all say it away to look almost
pretty much the same the undertones are
the same and you can see there's a
little bit of variation we're honest dog
and coloured raine hang out a little bit
tougher than the other two but they're
all pretty much the same
the fourth shade is cold low blow and
we're going to compare that to raw
sienna by Anastasio Royal Prerogative
by coloured raine and are you kidding me
by Pilate balls that is real frog ative
and are you kidding me are coming back
from the last swatch because there
really isn't a whole lot of difference
between soft and low blow if you really
look at them I mean there is a slight
difference but on the eye there really
isn't a lot of difference between the
two which is one of my big problems with
this palette if you compare those two
shades and raw Sienna from auto style
yeah they're still not too much
variation in the shades and the white
test shows that they're all the
understandings are pretty much the same
once again this shade I thought was
going to be the hardest to do and it
really was very difficult this is lumber
it's a beautiful pinkish shift on this
red tone and really there's no dupe for
this but I did want to put them next to
how you doing by violet vos and on sleek
by violet loss but really they're not
the same Urban Decay's is definitely
Pinker and in a white test they all hang
out they're pretty well not as well as
some of the matte shades but pretty well
this is one of my favorite shades this
is called he devil but as you're going
to see it's doable red ochre
Anasazi Beverly Hills and whimsy biked
art are very similar whimsy is a little
bit more on the orange side but they're
pretty much the same as we wipe these
away you'll see even more how whimsy is
just a little bit more orange but again
lasting powers fantastic this is another
one I thought was going to be difficult
to dupe this is dirty talk and I'm going
to compare this to on fleek by violet
balls they are very very similar but I
couldn't find any other dupes in these
palettes wiping them away violet lost
definitely seems to hang on a little bit
tougher but I look like the Urban Decay
would probably be more blendable
scorched is almost the exact same shade
as dirty talk so we're going to compare
that to on sleek and cranberry splash
from violet balls just so you can see
the differences in similarities they are
different I feel like that cranberry
splash is a little bit closer but they
are different I don't think that there
is a dupe for scorched in any of these
palettes when we wipe them away will
notice that cranberry splash definitely
stays on the best but they all have
pretty good lasting power just a few
more left Cayenne here we're going to
compare that to honest Ozzy as realgar
I'm not sure how you pronounce that and
tarts whimsy Cayenne is a little bit
lighter I'm going to go ahead and double
swatch that one just you can get the
true color but I feel like it compares
the best to whimsy you see the undertone
here is pretty good as far as the whimsy
and Cayenne dupe I feel like that's a
pretty close dupe I don't think real bar
it really is a do but you can see the
similarities between them and Fuego I
love that name and we go we're going to
compare that to red ochre from honest
audio we're bringing that one back Dutch
just from colored rain and teddy bear
from violet ball and as you can see
Duchess and teddy bear really are a lot
more Brown but I really wanted to see if
I can find more dupes for the shade and
obviously there's a fail there but I
feel like in Fuego and red ochre really
are pretty close just the and Fuego has
that little bit of brown in it that I
was hoping to be able to find in
Dutchess and teddy bear but I didn't so
I feel like that one is another one that
there really is no true dupe in this
palette but definitely the closest is
red ochre from honest Ozzy
these are less really really well I feel
like the Anastasio red ocher is
definitely the strongest as far as
lasting power but they all laugh really
well to left to left
ashes here ash is the one that I really
like a lot I'm going to compare that to
Cypress number from Australia teddy bear
from violet balls and smoked from Tarte
and ashes definitely has that purpley
reddish undertone to it that I thought
is the closest in teddy bear from violet
balls and I actually like Ash's better
than that shade and as we wipe them away
we will notice honest Asya and that the
tart definitely laughs the best but they
aren't the same shade so you can't
really compare them completely but again
great lasting power on these deeper
shades I do want to show you one more
comparison of ashes and drama by Tarte
and you can just see the pigmentation
difference is just insane drama is
insanely more pigmented and opaque than
ashes is the undertones are a bit
different here but personally I would
definitely choose drama over ashes here
and finally we get to another shade that
I absolutely love it's ember I thought
it was going to have a hard time keeping
this one but it really wasn't that hard
to me stylus yet be thrown from coloured
raine bat my eye from violet balls and
minks from chart I thought things from
tart surprisingly is very close to this
one but I think they're all pretty close
then you can do the exact same look with
any of these I think deep throat is
probably the least clothes but I mean
there's definitely similarities between
all these shades if you own any of these
palettes I don't think you need amber in
your life he actually didn't last as
well as I thought they would and if you
look at amber from Urban Decay it's got
kind of a black undertone that none of
the other shades have which is kind of
odd because I wouldn't have expected
that that black undertone so as it fades
on your eye through the day expected to
become smokier and that's that's why I
really like the white test is so that
you can see things like that but I do
think ember is a unique shade to these
in that black undertone but on the eye
during application it's going to look
pretty much the same as the others now
let me tell you what I think based on my
limited to day
Ariane's with this palette I wish I
could spend more time with it but you
either get it now or you get it in three
weeks and I don't want it to be in three
weeks so yeah I kind of already talked
you a little bit about it in the demo
how I feel about some of these shades I
really really really don't like these
first two shades at all they're very
weak you can wet them like you saw in
the demo and kind of beefed up this
shade out over here you can kind make it
a little shimmery but I feel like
there's so many shimmery champagne
colors out there they just check this
one spot
now when it comes to soft and low blow I
do really like those shades a lot I feel
like they're very nice I feel like
they're very pigmented so they go on
very easily
I love low blow as a transition like you
saw in the demo works really really well
I found that sauce was a little too
light for a transition for me but if you
are fairer than me then salsas might be
a good transition for you if you're
deeper than me you may be able to play
with some of these other matte shades
and matte chasing here perform
beautifully
except for Chaser they all perform very
very well so you could probably rock one
of those up in your crease as a
transition a big issue I have with the
shade selection here is we've got six
shades in here that really aren't that
different in tone especially these five
right here I think we start in within
Fuego you start getting a little bit
deeper and you've got some variation but
on the lid these all kind of muddy
together for me there's there's no real
separation of color especially when
we're talking dirty talk and scorched
there's just really no separation and as
you saw with the the lumber and scorch
there really wasn't enough different so
that you could see on my eye that
scorched was a bit deeper it is slightly
deeper but yeah I was very disappointed
in lumber when you when you Singer
swatch lumber just on your finger it
looks gorgeous it's got a beautiful
shift to it but you really need some
kind of 6 plus or water or something to
beef up the pigmentation of this and you
saw that in the demo when I use the 6
plus you can use water a spray bottle
with water
I remember watching Jackie I know do or
her video with this and she's putting on
like man look at that pigmentation
that's so great that you look oh by the
way I used to fix Clausen's like a wolf
that's why it looks so great I'm glad
she said it but it was kind of as an
afterthought and I was sitting
really impressed and then I realized you
know then she said she'd used to explain
all the go blah blah you know so Toby
was performing that way on its own
because now there are all these foiled
shadows that are so much better than
these that it's just like I feel like
they could have done better on Lombard
it's kind of disappointing for me these
three matte shades are fabulous they're
wonderful I have no complaints about
those and amber is absolutely gorgeous
if you've indeed skintone I can just
imagine amber looking gorgeous just all
over the lid because we've got that
beautiful shift to it it's just really
gorgeous it's a little too smoky for me
it's a little too intense I don't know
if I'll be doing that but I can see if
you do like that looking really really
good on the lid I put this on late last
night so I can't really speak to lasting
power and I just put it on just now so I
can't speak to asking power I will put
any updates as I use this to lasting
power down in the description below
based on the swatches and the white test
I would imagine these are going to last
really really nicely on the lid I did
wear them for about four hours last
night they did last pretty well for
those four hours I don't think that's
enough for me to give you like a full
verdict on lasting power so the last
question I like to leave you with is who
is this palette good for okay this is
what I want you to do I want you to
seriously go into your soul right now I
want you to sit and I want you to think
of your carlton plating this palette i
want you to think for a second have you
ever worn a red eyeshadow in your life
okay you answered okay if the answer is
no do you have any desire to wear a red
eyeshadow do you think you're going to
wear red on your eyes if the answer is
no do not buy this palette do not give
in to the gorgeous packaging do not give
in to the consumerism Thank You Kimberly
Clark do not give in to this palette do
not buy it it is not worth it you want a
warm palette there are so many warm
pallets coming out I don't think that
this is going to be for you now but if
you answered yes either of those
questions in that you love red eyeshadow
you wear all the time or you're really
interested in trying it then maybe this
one might be for you
my biggest thing about this is I wish
they hadn't gone so monochromatic
I wish instead of these six shades being
so Singh and similar why didn't you give
me a gold give me a gold give me an
orange and then I would have been so
happy because that would have opened up
an entire realm of possibilities can you
imagine a gold with like the shades over
here oh my gosh a halo eye with that but
a good thing about that is nobody says
you've got to stick to these shades you
can crowd your favorite gold foiled
eyeshadow and use it with this palette
so if you have shadows like that don't
be afraid to pull those into this so
it's not so monochromatic and you can
really get a cool flame look
so is it powder must-have absolutely not
is this going to be right for you you
really have to think about your answer
to those two questions that I asked you
earlier and that will kind of help you
decide it's definitely not my favorite
palette by any means but I can see why
some people would really really love it
it's one personally I'm probably not
going to reach for much when I think in
