me by that person that I do a vice
palette review I know there are a
million women out there so I'm going to
keep it quick and just kind of tell you
about all of the colors that are in the
palette um and what I thought of them so
let's go ahead and just get started the
first color is called desperation I like
desperation it's very pigmented it's
really nice for outer corner too dark in
a little bit on and if you're darker
stand a nice crease color it's very
smooth and creamy like desperation news
is the decks one going across and that
is my actual favorite eyeshadow of the
moment it is a shimmer eyeshadow it
doesn't have big chunks of glitter which
I like and it is fabulous for outer
corner and blending up into the crease
just poor dress obviously borders that's
my favorite jagged is I think the big
bust of this palette I found that it
works a little bit better wet but if you
don't wet it it's just chunky and
horrible I don't know what they're
thinking people are urban decay because
they know they have this high quality
product I don't know how this engine
ends up in a palette like how does that
even happen like it's just it's chunky
and gross and I just haven't seen a
single person on a vice powder you like
gee I guess it is a horrible color the
next one going over is called blitz
blitz is beautiful like a yellow
metallic like it's hard escribe it's not
a gold it's ain't like a yellow matao
their East range unique color but
beautiful like I like it on me but I
think it even more beautiful and someone
with a dark tan kind of color or on like
a brown brown skin would just be
absolutely beautiful and it's so
blendable so blendable like when you
blend it it doesn't go away it like
stays there but it blends so easily and
nicely I love the lips now penny lane I
thought was giving a lot like blitz and
it kind of is but it just doesn't blend
quite as well as blitz it is a really
pretty color and I do like it it's just
not my favorite the only done with the
second line is junkie I like junkie a
lot um it's very very pigmented but I do
like it I would never put junkie you all
over my lid it's too much what I'll do
is I'll put a light color on the inner
two-thirds and then on the outside I'll
just pow probably just kind of stamp
junkie and then kind of blend it a
little bit i got a lot of compliments on
my eyeshadow for what was it the my
October favorites video and I was
actually wearing junkie on my outer
corner for the for that video so if you
like that I showed that was junkie mixed
with um anonymous and echo beach which
I'll talk about later all right now
chaos kind of reminds me of bully bucks
from the book of shadows three I think
that's which one that I have the one
that came in the purple with the
butterflies and everything in the
pigmentation of it it's really not very
pigmented it's not that scary I don't
use chaos very often because i'm not a
big blue eye shadow person they really
have to have a very unique quality for
me to enjoy a blue-eyed child okay the
next one is occupy and occupy is very
deceiving it looks like it's going to be
very dark and it's not it shares out
very quickly I don't know how much I'm
gonna use occupy on its own unhinged is
like a teal sometimes what I'll do is
I'll put a little bit with on my lash
line and then I'll put like a black gel
liner over top so I just get that tiny
punch of teal so unhinged is really
really pretty if you can work at the
right way black market is just a typical
black um really nice to just add in the
outer corner um it's it's like any other
black it might be a tad bit lighter than
the other blacks that I have but for the
most part it's a black all right going
to the next line I have a love-hate
relationship with provocateur because I
want to love provocateur the glitter is
has so much fallout from from it that
it's it's really hard to work with I did
wear it in that getting unready with me
video if you haven't seen that it's
pretty fun I did my makeup and then I
ran the tape backwards so it's
everything coming off backward like my
hair like flips backward and stuff it's
really neat if you haven't seen it check
it out but provocateur just have to be
really careful with the fallout of it
rapture is also very deceiving it looks
like it's a light purple but it's
actually kind of dark there i can do
rapture on the outer half of my lid
because it isn't super dark so what I'll
do is I'll put a lighter color on the
inner corner at inner half and then I'll
start with rapture and I'll blend that
out and then I'll put vice stamp it in
the very outside and vice is the next
color which is a deeper purple but they
really blend nicely together so I have
paired them together and do it really
nice so like a light then rapture then
vice and then a little bit of black
market in the corner just to smoke it
out a little bit looks really pretty
noise is really funny I did not think I
was going to like noise because it is a
quite bright bright pink I love noise I
love it Woodstock is like too much for
me I can't handle Woodstock but noise is
a little less screaming um and it blends
really beautifully I mean it just is
gorgeous to blend and I use that in that
getting on ready with me video too and i
absolutely love anyways now armor is
very interesting to armor is very
deceiving it looks like it's a very
light grey but it's actually quite dark
on your lid it doesn't have a lot of
fallout even though it is very glittery
and I and if I'm wearing some kind of
silver I will grab armor before i'll go
for occupy which is more of a bluish
silver color you have a mind echo beach
in the palette look totally
same I mean they you can't even hardly
tell I guess nevermind looks a little
tiny bit darker but they pretty much
looked the same but they look totally
different swatched neither one are all
over lid colors for me latina skin will
look beautiful like I was saying with
rapture and Vice you could do the same
thing with nevermind and echo beach so
you would do a light color in the corner
and then echo beach in the middle and
then nevermind on the outside and then
smoke it out a little bit maybe with
news on the outside and kind of give you
that natural brown smooth you up maybe
gorgeous both of those colors are very
very clean very very blendable come on
another one of my favorites in this is
anonymous the more reason why it's one
of my favorites is because it's just so
versatile it's a typical brow bone color
they only complain about anonymous is it
it um does flake easily in the palette I
don't know if you can see that but I've
kind of scraped it a little bit it's
very sensitive shadow can't put a lot of
pressure on it it um it scratches very
easily but it's it's very pretty it's
very usable it's not and it's just it
but it's not it's not anything that you
probably don't already have if you have
a lot of shadow free bird is another one
I don't really like a whole lot because
it's not very blendable it's a little
bit on the chalky side and it just
doesn't transfer well to the lid it at
least on my skin tone because i am
lighter skin it seems to go on and it
just seems to come right off and maybe
it's just awkward your error but i can't
get free bird to work for me no matter
how hard i try it just doesn't show up
on my lid it's strange maybe it's just
because it's too close to my skin too
and it would work better for somebody
else but for me free bird does not work
for me last one is laced it's typical
it's very creamy it's
glenville i really like it but I don't
reach for a lot just because I have an
addiction shimmers right now I just got
a meat matte eyeshadow in my Ipsy bag
and I need to try to pay laced and my
matte eyeshadow and see how they work
better said that they can be beautiful
together it does come with a brush it's
just the typical fluffy brush on this
side and use that for blending and this
brush it's just not a brush that I I
don't know it's just it's it's stiff and
it's a little too stiff for me I don't
know I like other brushes that I have
that are similar to this better for for
putting color on it does have a really
really nice mirror I didn't mention that
and the palette is not for what you get
in it it is a good size it's not overly
obnoxiously good one thing I love about
this is the button on the front you can
just push it and and I just think that's
really neat you know it does have like a
soft rubbery kind of feel on the outside
and it's got the crystal plastic crystal
e UD on the front yeah overall I
absolutely love my vice palette I don't
think I like it as much as my naked 2
palette but I reach fort justice often
if that makes any sense because there
are colors in here that I like to use
pending on what I'm wearing I will find
the colors I need in here and i love
that that it's got a nice mix of neutral
natural shades and then bright colors so
you can kind of pinches based on
whatever it is you're wearing and just
reach for the one palette so if you want
some high-end I shadows that are good
eye shadows I would recommend getting
the vice palette it is a little bit on
the expensive side I think it's $59 but
if you think about that you're getting
48 120 eyeshadows there are of course
smaller than full size but I mean who
had
I shadows anyway and if you hit pan by
one of the symbols if you don't want to
use bright colors then i would recommend
one of the naked palettes instead that
is my opinion on the vice palette I hope
you enjoy that I hope that it was
helpful for you and if you liked this
