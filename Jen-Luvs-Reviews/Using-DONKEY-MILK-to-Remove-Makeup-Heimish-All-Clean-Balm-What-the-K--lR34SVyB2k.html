dough what the K where we test out
Korean beauty products to decide whether
they're worth your time and money today
we are testing out the all clean bomb by
a brand called Hamish and it is a
cleansing bomb with a little spatula guy
and this thing is like famous on reddit
everyone raves about this so we're gonna
see whether it's worth the hype or not
right now as I mentioned a moment ago
this is the Hamish all clean bomb it
cost me $17.50 on Amazon I got it
directly from Hamish cleansing bombs are
great for removing makeup so what I
usually do is I'll use my Clinique take
the day off or the bomb bombs away and I
will remove my makeup then I will use a
cleanser on top of that to like kind of
get the last residue or even like some
my solar water after that something else
beyond that to just make sure everything
was gone and then I'll follow with the
rest of my skincare routine so one thing
I was pleasantly surprised about what
this was the ingredients for it so I
compared it to the Clinique which is 29
50 and the bombs away which is $20 so
it's less expensive than those but it's
got a lot more interesting ingredients
you may think they're good or bad
depending on your personal experience
with some of these ingredients so let me
just do a little comparison with the
Clinique the 29:51 it is at the hexyl
palmitate base as is this which if you
don't like ethyl palmitate if you're
anti palm oil for environmental reasons
you're not going to want this or that
Clinique also has safflower seed oil as
the main ingredients now the bombs away
product is a mineral oil based product
so definitely very different than
I've had great experiences with both of
those for my skin as far as removing my
makeup I haven't had any trouble with
either one of those now this one has
some really interesting ingredients in
it though so we've got the F epsilon
Tate and then we've got like some
cleansers and some texture things and
stuff like that and then the sixth
ingredient is shea butter and the
seventh ingredient is donkey milk yes
there is a smilk in this literally so I
did a bunch of research on donkey milk
and what I could find was only in
articles and from places that sold the
donkey milk I couldn't find any
scientific studies on donkey milk but
these are some of the things that I
found first apparently Cleopatra used
donkey milk on her face to try to keep
herself young looking that's the legend
supposedly higher in vitamin C than
cow's milk it has omega threes and mega
sixes it supposedly absorbs very easily
can even out pigmentation reduce the
appearance of brown spots boost collagen
production protects the skin from sun
damage I mean lots and lots of claims
here considered an excellent ingredient
for those with skin ailments such as
eczema or psoriasis and can even help
reduce acne they also say that it's good
for dry dehydrated skin and more mature
skin should notice the biggest
difference so for me looking at all of
those we're looking at really good for
more dry damaged skin also acne prone
skin now these again are not scientific
sources some of them are from places
like refinery29
and you know places like Marie Claire
and some places that sell donkey milk so
I don't know how valid those claims are
scientifically but that's all I could
find so that's what I'm bringing to you
the next ingredient is coconut oil and
then we get into some citrus oils this
has a very very very strong fragrance so
we end up with lime oil orange oil and
grapefruit peel oil so if you do not
like citrus oils on your face some
people say that they can increase your
skin sensitivity and also they can be
irritation causing so if you have any
problems with those you may want to stay
away from this
they've got a lot of flower extracts and
plant extracts including Lotus and
jasmine and a told vise and I always
think a vice-like I just want to go to
sing on a mountaintop what I think April
bites and spin around and you know blow
whistles and things
there's also Rose extract in here and
lavender oil everyone people say they
don't like lavender oil so yes there
could be lots of great things in here
but there's also a lot of things that
are kind of questionable for some people
you just kind of have to take your own
personal experience with things
personally from what I've heard I would
recommend this for sensitive skin
because of all the citrus oils in it but
you may have a different experience and
again I'm not a cosmetologist I'm not a
dermatologist so you know just kind of
take what I'm telling you with a grain
of salt the directions for this product
is you're supposed to take three or four
scoops of the product rub it all over
your face
and then rinse it all as you can see I
have a very light makeup look on so I am
going to just apply an S ton of makeup
on my face I'm gonna put some craziness
on and I'll be right back okay I'm back
with an S on a makeup on my face so I
added some of my most favorite pigmented
eyeshadows I have my devious place eye
shadows on I plan some color brain
liquid lipstick I put on some in stain
blush I put I redid my concealer I threw
some powder foundation all over my face
to top off what I already have what I
already have foundation on so we're
gonna try and see if this takes it all I
think it's really really really
important to note the strength of the
scent of this it is very very very
strong incense so if you are sensitive
assets at all you are not gonna like
this so because I don't have running
water in here and I've been through this
once where I try to bring water in here
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna rub this
all over my face I'm going to go rinse
it off and then I'll be right back I
almost forgot to put on my bear ears I'm
really glad I didn't forget because I
think these are gonna be essential in
this process here oh I forgot to mention
I also put on two extra coats of mascara
I had them
eyelash on from the bomb and then I just
throw on some essence lash princess and
some lash paradise by L'Oreal so we
loaded up the mascara I wish I had
something like the benefit they're real
to put on but I know I look crazy right
now but I'm looking crazy on purpose
because I wanted to put on a lot of
makeup for use so it's already kind of
melting in my hands and it feels like
like a straight-up oil now and I'm just
gonna rub that on my face the strength
of it is very very strong I don't see
where this would be smart to put three
or four scoops on your face I think
that's crazy like this is plenty it is a
straight up oil like and it smells very
strong of flowers how'd it do on the
liquid lipstick my best yet okay let's
do the forehead and then we'll do the
eyes last and then I'll run to the
bathroom and I will see what happens
when I take one more scoop for the eyes
it's a lot earlier than the other two
the Clinique and the ball one that I've
tried before so I don't feel any
stinging all I feel is very oily I'm
just gonna kind of rub my lashes a
little bit extra being very gentle
though I'm not pulling or tugging or
anything kind of making sure I get both
over and under my lashes so I guide at
the brows so I am going to go wash this
off and I'll be right back with the
results I just looked at myself in the
mirror I look insane I am all rinsed and
as you can see I do still have some eye
makeup on I even still had a little bit
of that colored regular put lipstick on
I feel like this does not work as well
as the Clinique take the day off at
least after first impression usually
with the Clinique I definitely don't
have the raccoon eyes that may have just
been due to me not rubbing enough but I
seriously doubted I really felt like I
was rubbing everywhere especially as I
was rinsing it off I was really rubbing
you know gently I mean you know just
kind of you know trying to make sure I
got it everywhere and I do feel about
God everywhere and I don't feel like
this did as good of a job with my eye
makeup as the Clinique was but what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to go in again
with it and see if we can do a second
time because again it did say to use
three to four scoops so this is only
scoop number three and we'll put this on
the eyes again and see if I can get it
all off I feel like that's the only
thing that seems to be still on my face
my face feels cleansed but it doesn't
feel over dry which is really good
because I feel like with with the
Clinique and the ball one I feel like
sometimes my face can feel a little over
dry so that's a benefit but I definitely
don't think it took my eye makeup off as
well as I had hoped
remember I had three different kinds of
mascara on my eyes so maybe I was being
unfair to I don't know but I'm gonna go
ahead and I'm going to rub this on my
eyes again and see if I can get it off
I'm pretty sure that some of it is
seeping into my eyes a little bit
because of the corners of my eye and my
eyes do not sting at all which is a good
thing and you saw I opened my eyes
earlier and I was fine so that's really
good that I don't feel any stinging in
my eyes all right I'm gonna go rinse it
awful great back at this point I do feel
like my makeup is completely all I have
a tiny tiny bit of eyeliner or something
mascara or something right here on my
eyes just a little bit but it's
definitely nothing that is concerning me
at all the other thing to keep in mind
is this is a Korean product and there's
no one in Korea that would have as much
makeup on as I had on I mean if people
in Korea don't wear that much makeup so
keep that in mind to that I'm trying to
test this against American makeup and
mess of makeup I put on my face before
it started trying to take it off so you
know gotta keep that in consideration as
well but overall
I mean it's a good bomb it works it
definitely works the sense is gonna turn
some people off I think that's a big
negative all of the citrus ingredients
the lavender oil I know some people
really aren't gonna like that I do like
that it has the shea butter and the
donkey milk in it I think that's pretty
cool
especially if the claims on the donkey
milk are true I think that's awesome but
I mean you are washing it off
immediately so it's not like the
ingredients have time to really seep
into your skin I don't feel like it's
dehydrated my skin my skin feels pretty
good it definitely doesn't feel like I
feel cleanse but I don't feel over dry
if that makes sense so in all is this a
good product yeah that's a good product
is a great product no I think there's a
lot of people that aren't going to like
this for various reasons I'm actually
quite disappointed because I expected
this to be a five-star product with the
way that it's raved about on you know
Korean beauty forums I don't feel like
it is at least after this first
impression if I get any more impressions
of this I will definitely leave those in
the video description down below but so
far me it's good I'm happy to have it
but I'm sad that it didn't work as good
as some of my other products that is it
for what the K this week I hope you
enjoyed it if you did definitely make
sure you hit the subscribe button down
below I will tell you I am accidentally
out of new Korean beauty products so I
think next week I'm just gonna do a
single product review on maybe a mascara
or an eyeliner or a lip product or
something like that instead of what the
