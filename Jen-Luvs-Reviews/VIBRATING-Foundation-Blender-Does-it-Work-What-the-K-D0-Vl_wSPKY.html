the K where we test out Korean beauty
products to decide whether they're worth
your time and money today we're going to
be testing a beauty tool from Korea this
is by sense of care and it is called the
artists make up equipment it is a
vibrating foundation application tool
and I can't wait to try it out with you
as you know there are lots and lots of
ways to apply foundation back in the day
everybody just use their fingers and it
wasn't a big deal but now we've got all
different kinds of brushes and sponges
and all kinds of stuff so people are
trying to find creative ways to apply
your foundation that may or may not be
necessary so we're going to find out
whether this one is necessary or not it
is a Korean brand called sense of care
and it does say that it's waterproof and
it says as the soc professional
makeup-artist padding technology
provides two makeup covers so produce a
beauty and clean makeup cover without
stains so some of that I think is lost
in translation from korean to english
but what i'm getting out of it is that
you're supposed to pad the foundation
onto your skin with the vibrating tool
and it's supposed to give you good
coverage i don't really know what
without stains means maybe without
discoloration like the cover-up
discoloration maybe we're going to try
that against a beauty sponge this is a
sponge dry beauty sponge it comes with
like a little plastic stand I think it's
like 1899 and you get the sponge and the
little stand so I thought this would be
good instead of using a Beauty Blender
that everybody's seen a million times to
do a product that you may not have seen
before so we're going to be using that
but before that we need to apply primer
so I'm going to use my polish choice
resist smoothing primer serum first it
is a silicon based primer and today I'm
going to be using the Born This Way
Foundation I thought this off of
hautelook whole look now has a lot of
Korean beauty products on there so I got
it on HauteLook and I got it for $24.99
but I found that you can get it on
Amazon for like 15 bucks plus free
things I was like oh man I got ripped
off but then I saw on Walmart's website
that they had it for like 50 some
dollars what is it they had it for 54 98
on Walmart's website from one of their
Walmart sellers I also found it on a
weird random website that I've never
seen before called various reback store
I don't know 1999 there so I checked out
the Amazon seller he does have he or she
has good ratings it's called curious
small they have 126 reviews 97% good
rating and the ones that were negative
there was a comment from Amazon that
said this shift from us it's not the
sellers fault it's our fault
so that looks pretty good on that seller
so if you're planning on getting this I
would recommend getting it from that
Amazon seller based on the reviews and
the price who look also had that $7.99
shipping which is like the big killer
for a whole look I cannot stand their
shipping it's so crazy I didn't get some
other k-beauty with it though so it's
not like I paid just for this but you
know now I already installed the battery
the battery was really easy to install
it's one of those where you put the coin
in the bottom and turn the base with a
coin to open up the compartment and they
do include the battery with it so this
is what it looks like and then you kind
of push this here and pull then you take
one of the sponge heads here they do
give you four of them and they do say
that this is a waterproof tool so you
can probably wash the whole thing but
what I'm probably going to do is remove
this since this is all plastic and
there's no electronics in here I'm just
going to remove this to wash it which I
really like the sponge however right
here does not come off so eventually you
are going to have to replace it so
there's three other sponge heads to use
which i think is a plenty I think that's
very nice of them to include so many I
don't know if they sell the sponges
individually I don't think that they do
I did find their website but you can
only buy them wholesale I think you
could buy a minimum of like 3000 units
or something so you can't buy it
directly from the company you can only
buy it from independent sellers that
have already bought it from the company
I mean put up the microphone so you can
hear the vibration
I feel it really shaking in my hand when
I put my finger on here I can definitely
feel the vibration on my finger as well
I don't know if it's a strong enough
vibration to do anything to my skin but
we are going to find out apply an
appropriate amount of cosmetics on the
puff press the power button to start
vibration gently apply on cheeks and
forehead spread evenly over the entire
face gently tap the areas that need
extra coverage press the off button and
close the cap when finished so I can
either gently push it and have it come
on or I can pull the button down and it
will stay on so I really like that
feature that's nice and then you just
push it one more time to turn it off so
we're going to go ahead and do the right
side with this tool and then we're into
the left side with the beauty sponge and
they say to apply the foundation
directly on so I'm going to put my Born
This Way on here and I'm only doing one
pump to start and we're going to see how
that goes I get asked all the time what
this mirror is it's by a brand called
simple human you can get it at Bed Bath
&amp;amp; Beyond make sure you use the coupon
because they're kind of pricey okay so
let's go ahead and I'm going to turn it
on and leave it on there we go and we're
just going to kind of gently Pat
hmm I don't really feel the vibrations
doing a whole lot the sponge is quite
stiff I think I might need one more pump
for my forehead it is blending I'm going
to get another pump on here for kind of
the top half of my face I'm finding it
difficult to get around my nose creases
where with a beauty sponge I feel like I
can really get in those cracks
definitely even better than the silicone
sponge I'll tell you that I'm also
having trouble getting in here without
getting it all over my eyelid so I'm
just going to put it on my eyelid
because I don't only have a choice so I
don't like how stiff it is that I can't
get it to form to my face that easily
and I don't know if the vibration is
making a big enough difference okay I'm
done with this I'm going to go ahead and
turn it off as you can see it did get
quite dirty during use but that should
clean up pretty easily let's go ahead
and try with the beauty sponge and the
way I typically do that is I just I
squirt it on my hand instead and then I
blop it like this actually that's going
to be plenty I don't see that I'm going
to need two to two pumps for this half
of my face it definitely looks like it's
going to be plenty that's a lot of
foundation I don't know I guess I'm used
I'm used to using two pumps from my
entire face and I just did it on just
half because that's a lot of stinkin
foundation just for half my face so I
guess the sponge being brand new it
probably absorbed a lot of the product
but we'll see what happens
once I blend it in and we definitely
have more full coverage on the other
side you have to make it fair I should
probably use another pump on this side
that's a lot of foundation seems like
way too much to me this is way too much
cake face here I come
and just as an FYI my beauty sponge is
damp so this is the side with the tool
and then this is the side with the
sponge would love to know what you think
in the comments what do you think do you
think that one sided better than the
other looking at it very very closely
without any other product on my face I
feel like the this side is not blended
quite as well especially under my eyes
where this thing couldn't really get
it's flat and my face is rounded so it's
having trouble getting to like under my
eye but I feel like the coverage may be
a little bit better on this side it
looks a little more smooth as far as the
rest of my face I'm going to go ahead
and do the rest of my face and I'll come
back the final thoughts alright the rest
of my makeup is done if you're curious
what's on my eyes I do have a video
about that coming up the video is going
to be called something like an easy way
to change up your look in one step
something like that so when you see that
video that's this eye looks so make sure
you click on it and watch it if you're
curious how I got this eye look today
final thoughts on this after I put on
the rest of my makeup I feel like it
isn't worth more than this sponge I feel
like it is too stiff to really get into
the nooks and crannies and that's my
biggest complaint I only saw the
slightest bit of difference in the
smoothness of my foundation the airbrush
look of my foundation with this versus
the sponge I don't think it's enough
after I put on the rest of my makeup
after I put on the powder and all that
you can't tell a difference any more at
least in my opinion I did wash it so you
can see how much product came out of it
it does have a stain on it so this did
retain some product but I feel like they
give enough brush heads that it's going
to last a while I mean I would I will
probably keep this sponge head for three
to six months so this will last me
probably two years the sponges that they
sent which is good for me I'm fine with
that but I definitely don't know if I
can recommend this unless you just want
to try a fun little tool I think the
novelty factor would be the
settling point on this if you think it
would be fun to have something vibrating
on your face and maybe you would want to
try this for the $15 Amazon price if you
don't care about that and you're just
trying to put your makeup on this may be
just a little bit too much it's not
really necessary overall I am glad that
I tried it and I will be using it again
it's just I definitely don't think I
would purchase another one so I want to
thank you so much for watching
