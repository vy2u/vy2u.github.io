definitely building a box it's gonna
happen nice well we'll take you upstairs
in just a second and show you how we
build a box alright so this is how the
sample section looks you get to pick one
from each section so you get one from
this box and one from this box and one
from this box and one from this fox so
that's very exciting and I'm pretty sure
they change them out pretty often so
when you come back you get to see all
new products build a totally new box so
cool so this is the women's section and
then they've got this men's section over
here that is super awesome and John's
really excited about this stuff are you

what we got all right so we just left
orange box shop we did build to birch of
boxes we're super excited so we're going
to go ahead and show you what we got I
guess after week eat dinner

hotel will show you what we got and that
way we can spread it all out but it was
really fun the shop has a ton of stuff
in it
it was very overwhelming at first but
you know there's there's so much stuff
and it was just a lot of fun from you
know the bomb to cargo to steal la
amistad yeah you know all the men's
products and all that was all there so

really cool products yeah for sure yeah
so we're excited to show you this you so
we'll show you those pacific it's dark
in here it's dark okay but this is
really important so i have to tell you
that so we're at a place called movie
called life they presented us with this
menu okay there was regular menu and
then there was this menu and i'm going
to try to talk a little louder see they
keep you hear me so this is called game
guts
okay and it's like a special like prix
fixe menu right so john looked at this
people but yes and i was looking at it i
was like no because there's all kinds of
crazy stuff on it that the server came
by and he was like dude the whole table
askandar nobody at all so I'm taking it
for the team and I'm getting number one
is crispy puff beef tenderloin okay and
then there's much black pudding pie
which I'm not sure what that is ok that
one's not that bad but the next one is
beef heart tartare which freaked me out
it's got behind on Sesame sumac events
and keeper butter toast okay be part
that I am NOT adventurous like this okay
then even got veal sweetbreads with
apple puree fava beans mix radish salad
and sweet and sour sauce okay so i don't
i'm scared a veal because it just just
the concept of it kind of freaks me out
ok next one is rabbit okay i know Lottie
something like that with grazed
cockscombs okay that's the thing that
goes off of the Roosters head okay
braised like
like the stuff that goes off the
roosters had they like chopped it off
and they beat it to you like I'm freaked
out okay with crispy chicken skin okay
pork ramen broth and egg yolks okay and
then the fifth course is the new zealand
venison which is another thing that
freaks me out I just not a fan of eating
Bambi and then pickled beets for a
hibiscus black garlic cocoa nib for
Nolan the only minute sounds good to me
which is a caramelized white chocolate
tart with peanut butter cream banana and
bacon which sounds epic so it was either
all or none and I'm in and I'm doing
this thing and I'm going to go positive
attitude and I'm excited so
I'm very excited all right so we'll
check in with you later and wish me luck
pray for me pray for me
alright she's about to eat the cockscomb
to do
it's not bad it's not great
this is rabbit ravioli
hello my friend it has been a long but
very fun and adventurous day we just got
home from the craziest dinner that I
have ever had in my entire life I ate
part of a Rooster's head hey some duck
stomach I ate some baby cow I hated some
chicken skin what I'll say kind of
craziness but dessert dear me yeah but
dessert was worth a dessert was epic
Italy was like the Isle of like bacon in
like something sweet like a
chocolate-covered bacon just my favorite
so like chocolate peanut butter bacon
banana banana you know it was amazing so
but anyway enough about dinner we wanted
to show you our birch boxes that we got
at the Birchbox shop show you what we
picked out mine was $15 John's was 25 he
got six things I got five there we go
that's better oh we're done oh thank you
okay so it lets you pick what box you
wanted and I got the pink one and then
they put it in tissue paper like a
birchy box and then that is the contents
of my box that I need so the first thing
i got was this DDF brightening cleanser
and it is a full-size so I'm really
excited about that and then I got the
Fekkai this is like a hair conditioner
for color-treated hair so I just got my
hair dyed so I was very excited to see
that I got this this is by Art Club it
is a nail art duo it's got they said
Scott a dotting tool on one side and
then a brush on the other side so
there's the oh this is striper so
there's a striper on this side I said it
was a brush that's a striper so then
there's like a little I don't know if
you can see that but there's like a
little you squeeze it out and it's like
a you know dotting tool kind of thing
you know make little dots little lines
things like that little designs a little
sort of these if you want to and then I
got this vasanti cuz ya'll extreme rose
gold eyeliner
mmm gosh water looks like I thought that
would be really pretty on the lower lash
line that would be gorgeous and then the
last thing that I got was a perfume and
it's a chilly a cologne and it smells
immersion and it is orange sanguine I
don't know how to say I have to OPEC to
rip it open um but it just smells really
good I can't even stop it people don't
want to stay here forever while I open
up this packaging alright comes with
like a little card here and it just
talks a little bit about it but or
injured it smells orangey orange II kind
of perfume and it comes a little bottle
like this it's not a spray bottle so
that kind of stinks but it smells really
good it's like orange and for all so
that is my Birchbox that I spent fifteen
dollars all I think this is definitely
worth fifteen dollars very excited about
it I think it's well worth over $15 and
it makes me happy so you ready to show
you where is baby like a little
impromptu Birchbox smackdown alright
alright I'm not wanted to stick okay can
I hold your stick mm-hmm alright boom
that's the birchbox look at that epoch
okay so I got six products my first
product is from english laundry and this
is arrogant it's a perfumed shower gel
this is amazing four ounces my second
product is baxter of california and this
is a hard cream pomade so this is a firm
hold and a soft finish I like baxter of
california and I like my hair products
so that's pretty rad this next one I've
never tried this before this is michael
todd and this is blue-green algae
antibacterial toner aids and treatment
and prevention of acne I don't really
have acne problems but I like skin
toners so this will be cool and it
smells really good this right here is
from men's science I've never tried it
their product so I figured
pick one of these these up because I had
a lot of the other products in this
category this is post-shave repair combs
redness and razor burns so this is like
a good soothing product for after
shaving it has some tea tree extract in
it along with some other stuff so it
kind of smells like tea tree so that's
pretty sweet my full size lifestyle
product bombas socks or bomb ass socks
whatever however you want to say it I
love these I've gotten these in Birchbox
before they're super comfortable and my
last product is another english laundry
product and this is the scent notting
hill a little spray sample cologne joint
um this is really good citizen so all of
that good stuff for twenty-five dollars
that's a pretty pretty huge win for me I
really like this concept because you can
go in and you can build your box like
you have a bunch of different products
you can just be like that's money that's
money that's money that's money so like
everything that you pick out is
something that you're super excited
about so and they have so many choices
it's nice that they have a lot of
choices in each category and I'm pretty
sure they changed him up like monthly
they said they changing about weight off
and as far as what's in the case is free
to choose from so you're in the new york
city area i highly recommend going to
the birchbox shop and soho it was a lot
of fun people they were super nice so
that's it for tonight it was a fun
eventful night we're really excited
about IMATS tomorrow morning gonna meet
