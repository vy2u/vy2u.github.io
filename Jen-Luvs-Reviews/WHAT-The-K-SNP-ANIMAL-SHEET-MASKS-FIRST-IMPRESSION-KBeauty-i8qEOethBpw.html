first one okay we're gonna be focusing
on Korean beauty and skincare in this
brand new series cited I'm so stoked for
this all year so today on what the K we
are going to be doing animal face masks
I am so excited about these I got these
on Amazon I paid 11:49 for eight packs
and there's four different variations
that I'm gonna show you the sellers name
is find inner peace but the brands on
here is called shining nature purity and
I ordered them on February 22nd they
arrived on February 24th so the four
different kinds are the animal panda
whitening masks we also have the animal
tiger wrinkle masks very excited about
that one the animal dragon's soothing
mask and the animal otter aqua masks and
what makes these special is that they
make your face actually look like the
animal while you're wearing the face
mask now it's been watching my channel
for a while you know that I do not enjoy
face masks on the whole but this seemed
like so much fun I just decided to just
bite the bullet and just do it but we're
gonna go ahead and we're gonna put on
the animal tiger wrinkle mask and then
I'm going to tell you about the
ingredients that are in these and
whether they may actually work or not I
mean a little me Oh what is happening
here okay there's some gooey goodness in
the bottom of this we're gonna save that
for a minute I'm just gonna set that
right there be the change Tiger so here
we go you guys see this
don't-don't-don't isn't done it's the
eye of the tiger it's the thrill of the
milk damn I'm a dancer nananana nananana
oh it smells a little funky I don't know
if I'm gonna be able to give direction
with this thing on cuz
so we're supposed to leave this on for
ten minutes all right
ten minutes well it's 10 to 20 minutes I
don't know if you're gonna be able to
understand me with this thing on I
wasn't expecting that
can you take me seriously while I'm
wearing this thing so one thing I want
you to know about myself seriously
okay I'm breathing it in I don't think
this is meant to like talk but on your
face what you need to know about these
maths is that yeah I can't talk about
this thing all cuz it's like sliding and
getting in my mouth and that can't be a
good thing so I'm gonna go ahead and
take this off for now what you guys get
the point and I'm gonna save this for in
just a minute
it doesn't feel especially slimy it just
feels wet so I'm just gonna shove that
in there for now and we'll just rub in
the goodness there's a lot of goodness
rubber into my face right now so I'll
put some of my hands too because I could
use a little bit of anti agent put a
little on the deck or tang let's just
bathe in the stuff okay so as far as the
things I want to tell you about these
baths so the first thing is that there
are a couple of ingredients in here that
are not as good so the first one is
phenoxyethanol which is a preservative
that's in a lot of make up products and
people can have an allergic reaction to
it so people are very sensitive to it
the other one is perfume perfume and
fragrance you don't know what kind of
perfume or fragrance it is it is the
very last ingredient no that's my neck
it's dripping it's a less ingredient and
all of the best so depending on your
thoughts on the fragrance I'm going to
leave some links down below about
fragrance of you may or may want not
want to pass on this the other one is
alcohol it doesn't say what kind of
alcohol it is so depending on a type of
alcohol it can be worse or better so I
don't know what type so it's hard to
tell whether that's gonna be a bad thing
or not so those are the negatives now
let's talk about the positives so before
the author Matthew critics are actually
really good in this so we've got
glycerin which is a lubricant and a
bonding agent it attracts water to the
skin and helps the skin feel smoother
and softer
water is hydrating but it needs time to
sit on the skin in order to work alcohol
is the third ingredient of something
called the tain be ETA I and II is a
humectant and an anti irritant that's
probably gonna help with any irritation
with the alcohol sodium hire an aide it
promotes skin and blood of micro
circulation and nutrient absorption
absorption you know we have pomegranate
juice extracted helps prevent cell
damage speeds wound healing as well as
plays a positive role in the repair of
Sun damaged and aging skin now we have
something called chestnut shell extract
that's for skin firming Japanese
knotweed which helps to slow the
appearance of lines and wrinkles and
tree hollows trehalose Tremeloes may
allow the skin to retain moisture that
it would otherwise lose and then lotus
flower oil which has antioxidants it's
hydrating and anti-aging so that's the
otter going the animal otter aqua mask
say that five times fast now a lot of
them are the same ingredients I'll list
them down in description so you can
check out which ones are the same so now
we're just gonna talk about the ones
that are different so new ones in this
one are evening primrose oil the
anti-aging tiger mask that's skin
soothing and it has emollient benefits
and it helps with absorption then we
have camilla jeff the NICUs seed oil
which is a potent antioxidant and it's
skin soothing then we have sodium
hyaluronic pomegranate juice extract
acai acai acai acai fruit extract that
is an antioxidant and then blueberry
extract we actually treats acne
revitalizes the skin hastens healing and
makes the skin I have an overall glow
can you tell I didn't make that up
because it said he sends healing I would
never say that but again links are down
below write that out this information
okay the dragon's soothing mass has
something called a beta glucan in it
it's soothing moisturizing it has anti
irritant properties promotes wound
healing and reduction in scouring
licorice root extract which is skin
soothing and improves the look of an
uneven skin tone then green tea extract
antioxidant and
Tai carcinogenic properties when
ingested but limited studies prove that
it does anything for the skin so we
don't really know whether it would do
anything on the face mask and then
rosemary leaf extract which is calming
on the skin and then the last one is the
whitening line niacinamide improves the
appearance of enlarged pores uneven skin
tone fine lines dullness and weakened
skin surface can also increase whitening
when combined with other whitening
products then we have something called
paper mulberry extract which is skin
whitening then mulberry extract there
are actually two different things
brightening and improving uneven skin
tone and some pomegranate juice extract
and some a raspberry fruit extract in
here so this definitely has whitening
properties in it I don't know I think
it's just mostly supposed to even out
your skin tone and I don't know it kind
of freaks me out maybe I'll try it maybe
I won't so what we're gonna do now is
I'm gonna put this mask back on I'm
gonna leave it on let's see I've had the
juice on my face for about seven minutes
so I'm gonna put this back on I'm gonna
leave it on for another 10 and then I'll
be right back to get you kind of review
of how everything went okay come here do
you want to get turned into animals yeah
yeah okay yours is gonna be this one and
you want to turn into a dragon
and then why like you could turn into an
honor so we'll give John the soothing
mask and Lila the aqua mask how's it
stand on your face cuz it's so slimy
there's so much boogie on it you don't
have to keep it on if you don't like it
okay alright I didn't feel weird it does
alright here we go
you don't like it on is it - it is funny
when sure I guess yeah yeah I'll give
put your face up there you go put your
face up
okay ready to turn it to an otter
yeah it's gonna be cold and slimy that
so that doesn't go all right how's it
feeling Here I am I'm a beast you do
look like a beast you're sissy and
dragon do you think that you could wear
this for 10 to 20 minutes yeah I think
I'll be all right I don't really like
cheap masks like this too slimy all
right John abandon his see how when is
faces so then you take it and you rub it
into your face and you don't rub all
that skin care goodness into your face
does it feel and does it feel sticky or
does it not feel sticky yeah
not sticky just wet yeah all right mines
it on for a long time so I'm gonna take
mine off because I've had mine on for a
while thank you buddy
one thing that's good is there's a lot
of slime left in the container on the
end like the pouch so if you wanted to
like reserve that since it hasn't
touched the skin if you want to preserve
that you can kind of use that as like a
extra little skin care love just to rub
on your face without using the mask so
and they say you don't have to rinse it
off they say you can keep it on your
face and use the skin care benefit
goodness so hopefully I'll be really
cool free I doubt it but hopefully we'll
be wrinkle free so Lila you're gonna
keep that on for a little uh she's
you're trippin there's so much liquid on
here that it's actually dripping so
overall I feel like if you like sheet
masks this may be something you want to
try out but they are very wet but they
have great ingredients in them other
than those few they have some really
good ingredients in them and they were
relatively inexpensive and only a little
over a dollar apiece next time on what
the game we're going to be doing the
Golden Monkey glamour lip 3-step kit and
I'm just gonna do that one not the kids
because it's like a lip plumping thing
and that would just be weird for a child
so
make sure you subscribe so you don't
miss it not love and we'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
