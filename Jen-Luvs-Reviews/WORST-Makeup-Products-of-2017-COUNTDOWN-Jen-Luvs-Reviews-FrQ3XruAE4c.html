anymore oh hey I didn't see you there
welcome back to my channel today we're
gonna be counting down the worst
products to the even worst products to
the worst product I tried this year in
2017 it's pretty bad that sounds like an
interesting video do you hang tight
we're getting started right now as I was
getting together my ideas for my
favorites and fails for 2017 I realized
I just had way too many products that I
want to tell you about so I decided I
was gonna split this into two videos one
for the fails and one for the favorites
so this is gonna be the fails video I
will have the favorites video up for you
I'm hoping for the end of 2017 that's my
goal it just kind of depends on how that
week goes with the kids off whether I
can get that done for you or not before
I get going just stating the obvious I
have a cold my daughter gave it to me it
was worth it to like cuddle with her and
hang out with her to get her cold
totally cool with it sorry my voice is a
little annoying but I'm sure it'll clear
up eventually but not for this video
today we're gonna be counting down the
worst products I tried 2017 it actually
was kind of hard because I tried a lot
of really bad stuff in 2017 we're gonna
go ahead and start with number 10 so
when I was getting together products for
this video it was really truly a
personal choice I know that a lot of
products are going to be good for other
people and just not for me
and number 10 is definitely one of those
it was a really bad product for me but I
know that a lot of people really do
enjoy this product and I'm not trying to
take that away from you I promise is
just a difference of opinion and if
there's anything that is solidified in
my mind this year is the differences of
opinion are perfectly okay and I still
love you even if we disagree on things
it's totally cool and this is something
we might disagree on this is a Kat Von D
shade + light glimmer palette I really
didn't like this palette and and I try
to like it I tried really hard I just
don't I don't like the whole topper
thing I've realized I don't like the
glitter fallout on my face I mean these
shades up here aren't bad these two
satin ones well three satin ones
our bad but man there's like two four
six shades in here that I just don't
like wearing because of the glitter
fallout it really bothers me hey by the
way I have a friend named Linda who has
a channel named glitter fallout I stop
Linda how are ya
so anyway now that I'm back on topic I
just didn't like it I don't enjoy using
it it's not fun for me I am gonna keep
it for my collection for comparisons to
other pilots because I am a makeup
reviewer if I wasn't a makeup review to
you review where I would definitely be
passing this on because I just I don't
have fun with this palette and it makes
me sad
boo next up is something that I don't
have anymore actually return it to the
store I will put a picture right there
it is the Sephora Pro cool palette it
was fine I think what they decided to do
is they wanted to have something at
Sephora they would compare to like
Natasha to Nonna and visi art and things
like that for me that palette felt
completely short it felt like it was
powdery I didn't like the way the
shadows looked on my eyes I compared it
to like the lower quality Too Faced
formula it just didn't work for me I
didn't enjoy it I didn't have fun using
it so I took it back to the store and
again I'm not knocking you if you loved
that palette like I'm so happy for you
that you love it
I just didn't love it it didn't it
didn't float my boat you know what I
mean Oh No
so let's go into the tattoo junkies lip
paints I do still have these they are
some of the most drying liquid lipsticks
I have ever used they're super super dry
but this is the saving grace on these is
the stoppers that come with them make
for beautiful loose eyeshadows and they
do look beautiful for a short period of
time if you're looking for like an
Instagram photo to make your lips look
really metallic or something like that
but these were so incredibly
uncomfortable like I couldn't even I
couldn't wear them for more than half an
hour because it made me so uncomfortable
I really didn't enjoy these at all these
were a big know they have glitter ones
that look really really pretty but if
you actually get the glitter in your
mouth of course it's gonna taste like
eating sand it's just the so for me
these are a huge no I was gonna do an
entire video on these and I just
couldn't keep him on long enough to wear
them for a whole video it just wasn't I
wasn't having fun with them I'm still
not having fun with them now this
video is done I'm going to try to maybe
no I can't pass these on that's gross
I'm gonna throw them away I am going to
keep these guys though because these
things are pretty cool oh please
number seven is another thing that I
don't have anymore it's the boscia jelly
ball cleanser I will insert a little
clip of that jelly ball that I showed in
my monthly favorites and fails for it
last month it dried out something
terrible and it wasn't that it was a bad
cleanser it was a fine cleanser it just
it's there's no proper way to store it
so that it stays fresh and new so that
it keeps that hydration that you need
and it just kind of deflated and got all
gross and nasty and it's just I would
never repurchase that thing it was just
it was not good for me that one's
definitely a no because of its inability
to keep its form over a period of time
it's way too expensive of a product to
have it do that I feel like if it's
gonna be that expensive it better have
something you know some kind of
container with it that keeps it fresh
and new so that's just my opinion I
won't be buying that one again please
the next few things are things that I
don't have anymore because I returned
them this is the lorac I love brunch
palette it was also called beauty's who
brunch I don't know why some of them
were called one thing and some were
called another thing mine will call it I
love brunch I don't know what happened
there I don't know if they were slightly
different or I don't know but anyway the
I love brunch won it for me it was so
Montana monochromatic it was so similar
in tone that I had a lot of trouble
working with it to get pretty eye looks
if I used one of the shades out of the
palette I could get a really beautiful
look I love lyrics formula Rox formula
is fantastic but I just I couldn't I
couldn't dig on this palette enough to
keep it there were a couple of shades
like avocado toast I remember
specifically that I absolutely loved but
it wasn't worth it to me to keep just
four avocado toast just wasn't that she
had I remember really really liking I
did do a full review of that one I will
link it down below but but I did end up
returning it it just wasn't good enough
for me to keep there weren't enough
shades in there that I loved so I was
really sad about that I wish that they
had done at least a couple of mid-tone
shades a couple of deep shades just to
balance out the palette a little bit but
yeah I just it just didn't Wow me didn't
blow me away mmm this one I'm kind of
cheating on because they're both
two-faced peach stuff so I figured I
could just put them together and the
same thing because they're both equally
as bad this is the Too Faced peach
highlighter it was a cream highlighter
that came out with their peaches and
cream collection
it just it melts it into nothing I mean
if you like really subtle hi-low like
really to the point where people have to
take a magnifying glass to your cheek
you'll be able to see your highlighter
then you may like it for me it did
absolutely nothing I couldn't see it it
was like I put it on and it's like oh
where am I let her go I don't have any
more highlighter so I returned that I
also had this this Too Faced peach glow
palette again serious issues with
pigmentation and it surprised me because
I did really like this one this is the
Papa don't peach blush I really like
this one this one worked really great
for me and I use this all the time but
that one it just the pigmentation wasn't
there I couldn't get it to be on my face
if you're very fair-skinned maybe it'll
work for you but that's the only people
I can see that working for I gave away
that one that one I gave away to my
reporters I did a big huge declutter and
gave a bunch of stuff away to my
reporters and I'm pretty sure that was
in there because I don't have it anymore
hmm
now we're getting to the bad the really
really really bad okay this is an
expensive one this was the effortless
breathable tinted primer by Sunday Riley
every time I use this my foundation
breaks up every single time I haven't
found a single foundation I have what 20
different foundations something like
that I've tried this with maybe six or
seven of them and just just in the hopes
because there's a lot of product in here
it's 30 milliliters loads of product I
want to get my money out of it I got it
at the Birchbox shop I wanted to get my
money's worth and yeah haven't found a
single foundation this works with so if
you've tried this and you found a
foundation that it doesn't break up on
you if you you this is you know you
found some kind of magic touch with this
you've gotta let me know because number
three is by far one of the worst
mascaras I've ever tried this is the Mac
false lashes mascara you would think
that Mac knows a little bit about false
lashes that when they're trying to
scare they're like you know this reminds
me of false lashes let's call it the
false lashes mascara wah-wah-wah this
this is not false this does nothing
nothing
absolutely nothing it colors my lashes
black and that is it it's terrible I
mean it's just it doesn't do anything
and I would love to know if you've had a
good experience with this mascara I
would love to know about in the comments
below
what are your lashes look like you have
naturally long lashes you have naturally
full lashes because I have neither so
maybe this works for people like that
but if the point is is that it's the
matte false lashes you'd think the
people with very little bits of terrible
lashes like me will be the ones that
benefit the most not people who
naturally have lashes that look like
false lashes maybe that was the idea
behind it if your lashes already look
like false lashes then this mascara is
for you that's a new marking see Mac
needs to pay me for their marketing
because that was pretty good oh please
I had this grand plan for a Fendi dupe
video with the Catrice HD liquid
coverage foundation I was gonna do this
video and then I realized I just can't
stand this competition I can't even wear
it like it bothers me so much the sense
of it is so incredibly strong it gives
me a headache and I can't wear it and it
kind of ruined my idea for this venti
Foundation video I may use this in a
video at some point before the Fenty
hype goes out but I I don't know it's
just every time I went to go film that
video was like stuff stanky its stanky
it just smells really strong of like
flowers like it's like really strong
perfume scent all over my face and it
lingers and I don't like it I also a
spoiler alert I don't like the fenty
foundation on me it always breaks up no
matter what I do it breaks up around my
nose on my chin and I don't even have
oily skin I have normal skin the same
thing with this one they are I don't
think I said this yet their formula
dupes there's a little bit of difference
in the Fenton that it has I think some
things to mask the scent down in the
lower parts of the ingredients but other
than that their complete formula dupes I
don't know what fenty was thinking
getting being a dupe with this but they
obviously did something right because a
lot of people seem to really like the
Fendi foundation
I am personally not a fan it doesn't
work for me but everybody's skin type
again is different so you know maybe it
works better with your skin than it does
with mine but it does not work with mine
and this one is so much worse just
because of the Sun I'm not going to
include the fenty in this because I'm
kind of giving you a little bit of a
review in there but yeah this was a huge
note for me it gives me a headache
it's awful oh did I mention only comes
in like three shades there's another
down point that's terrible number one
okay this is this is because of
embarrassment factor this is this the
reason why this is the worst product I
tried is because I was actually
embarrassed because of this product and
this is nothing against this brand this
is a great brand okay I have nothing
personal against the brand I something
personal against these lip products
these are the makeup geek cream stains
let me tell you the embarrassing story
and why I'm mad at these so I was
wearing this one right here this one is
in Grapevine at IMATS and I was walking
around walking around for hours and
hours and hours and I went to the into
the restroom I used the restroom I came
out and I looked at my lips and I went
there it was awful my lips were all
crackled and there were patches missing
and I was like oh my gosh I've been
walking around I'm at wearing this and
it looks awful and I looked and I went
oh my gosh and the girl next to me was
like what I was like my lips look awful
she's like oh my gosh what is that and I
was like they're the makeup geek creme
stain she was like really say yeah she's
like oh I won't be buying those I was
like I'm really sad that I did buy them
and I counted on them not to embarrass
me and I Mads me these crackle on my
lips they're very very uncomfortable
they were uncomfortable at IMATS and I
was trying to do the wear test and I was
trying to get it to you know see how at
war and it was just a bad idea to wear
this for you know the second or third
time I'd only won them more natural
shades before this was the first time
I'd worn a darker one and I knew they
were uncomfortable I knew they cracked
it a little bit but I don't know I was
just a stupid choice I take full
responsibility but I do blame makeup
geek well I should take responsibility I
can't blame an inanimate object for my
bad choice but they're still gonna be at
number one for the worst product I tried
in 2017 because I'm still slightly
better even though I really should take
responsibility all right fine I don't
blame you inanimate object it's still my
fault but
still not happy and I'm still never
using you again so that is it for my
countdown of the worst products I tried
in 2017 if you found this negative sorry
it's a negative video it's clear in the
title this is gonna be about things I
don't like but please don't take it
personally if I said I don't like
something that you love please don't be
offended upset just know I love you no
matter what you love as long as you're a
good person you treat people well then
then I love you I think you're great so
