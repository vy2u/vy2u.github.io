channel so this is an example of how you
shape the content on my channel I
recently put up a video of products that
are highly rated at Sephora and Ulta and
it really went off very well everybody
seemed to really really liked it so I
switched gears for today's video and now
we're gonna be talking about low rated
products on Ulta and Sephora and whether
I agree with those ratings or not
because I feel like some of them I
actually kind of like a little bit I'm
also curious to know what you think
about these products if you tried them
so let's go ahead and get into them
right now before I get started just
though very quickly what I'm wearing
today on my eyes I'm wearing even Tasha
- no no lila palette on my lips i have
the rani cosmetics lipsticks park
dialing lipstick in the shade latte and
then my necklace is Kendra Scott I got
this from Kendra Scott at generation
Beauty another thing I wanted to mention
very quickly is I remembered in the last
video that I used to do this and I want
to start doing it again which is
featuring comments on the channel at the
end of the video so I started it in the
last video where you can see during the
end credits some comments that people
have left on recent videos that were
highly rated by the community so I'm
going to continue to do that because I
think it's a super cool way to get you
involved and kind of put your thoughts
permanently in a video so I'm really
excited about this would make sure
you're stay tuned to the end to see if
your comment gets featured I do want to
let you know that some of these things I
have decluttered some of them I have
given away to friends and subscribers so
I don't have everything but I definitely
have a fresh memory of what these things
are like so let's start with one that I
do have this is the TARDIS a pro Glo
liquid highlighter I only have a sample
of this and I was really excited to get
a sample with my order at Sephora I
believe and it's just a baby this is in
the shade stunner there are three shades
available for this it is $29 for the
full size and I don't think this is that
bad I I thought it was okay I don't know
if it's worth the $29
but and the reason why I say that is
because I feel like it kind of sits on
top of my skin rather than kind of
melding into my skin and looking like my
SCANA has a natural glow I feel like
either a highlight
really looks like it's part of your skin
or it just kind of lays on top and I
feel like this is one that kind of lays
on top but I'm little dad I think that
looks fine but again I wouldn't pay $29
for it I would pay $10 for a full size
of this but not 29 this is one I
wouldn't even pay five cents for this is
horrible this is the two-faced peach
frost melting powder highlighter in the
shade happy face it's beautiful
it's really pretty I think I would pay
five cents you know to put this on
display or something but as far as a
highlighter it's awful it basically just
disappears into the skin it doesn't do
anything for me at all I mean it just
basically disappears it does smell like
peaches I do enjoy that about it and
again the packaging is gorgeous I love
the little mirror inside but this is a
big want want for me did not enjoy this
and I do enjoy a cream highlighter
occasionally but this one's terrible
next is one that I don't have anymore I
did declutter this this is the stay
flawless 15 hour primer and the reason
why I didn't like this is because I feel
like maybe you have better advice for me
on this but for me it's thick primer
doesn't make any sense because unless
I'm going to paste it all over my face
like it unless it's gonna do like a
really light application it ends up
being too much and that's what happened
with this is I felt like I was just
painting my face all over and because I
like primer all over my face I don't
need it just like on my t-zone I know
some people will just put on the
forehead on their t-zone and this would
be good for that but for my purposes I
prefer something that I can rub between
my fingers and put all over my face
that's just my preferred method so this
was a big bust for me I don't remember
it extending the wear of my makeup or
making my makeup look any better but I
can't 100% attest that because I
honestly like my memory feels like I'm
not a hundred percent on that but if you
have tried this I'd love to know your
thoughts on it I declared it it's not a
good product for me and it was mostly
due to the format of it and it's just
not my preferred format for a face
primer this is one that I actually gave
away to a member of the collective brain
her name is Veronica she's amazing this
is the do the hula soft matte liquid
bronzer I'm pretty sure I gave it to
Veronica I'm like 99% sure I gave it to
her and this is one that it was very
orange on me I didn't like the way that
it looked it just looked like a balloon
ish it looked terrible on me and she has
a deeper skin tone so I thought that
maybe she'd be able to pull it off since
she's warmer undertones than I am but
she didn't like it either it just it was
just the wrong color I don't understand
how it can get to production being that
orange I'm sure that it would work for
some people that have really warm
undertones but if you're trying to get
something that's good for the masses I
feel like a neutral undertone is
probably a better way to go if you're
only gonna come out with one shade it's
another thing if you're gonna come out
with you know cool and neutral and a
warm cool but if that's the only one
you're gonna come out with just know I
mean I feel like benefit really lacks on
their bronzer shade selection
I feel like they can do much better and
I wish that they would because I feel
like they're constantly putting out the
same products over and over and over
again and these stupid little kits that
are very very cute but it's like how
many minis do I need of the they're real
mascara instead put your energy into
extending your shade range they do have
some good products like I love their
brow products their brow line that came
out was like OnPoint and awesome but
they need to do more of that and less of
this repetitive expletive deleted this
is one I couldn't find I looked
everywhere I tore apart my room I
couldn't find it it's tiny
it is the Too Faced white chocolate chip
palette and this one I didn't think was
terrible I mean there were a lot of
people that hated this palette I did a
full review of this palette I didn't
like it I didn't prefer it just because
I didn't prefer the shade range I felt
it was very very light and it didn't
offer a lot of variation but I think the
quality was terrible
I thought the quality was fine it was
fine and I can see some people really
enjoying this palette especially if you
were of a lighter skin tone I can see
creating some gorgeous looks with this
palette I didn't think it was that bad
but I mean it's low rated on Ulta so I
guess a lot of people thought it was bad
my friend one thing I talked about in
that video was my friend Tina Marie over
at true meeting of radiance she has a
deeper skin tone and she put on and she
just looked like a disco ball like it
was like there was nothing she could do
about it
it just looked crazy on her because it
was such a contrast to her complexion
and she hated it she absolutely hated it
because it just didn't flatter her they
missed it on the shade selection I wish
that they had done a little
bet I know it's the white chocolate chef
palette but if they had kind of maybe
thrown something in there to give it a
little more oomph a little more depth a
little more you know variation I think
that would have been smart but you know
I get it it was the white chocolate chip
palette it is what it is and again I
don't hate this palette it's fine it's
just not fantastic this is one that is
in my mind the worst mascara I have ever
tried this is the NARS audacious mascara
and the big issue I have with this is
the wand the wand is stupid it is
straight-up stupid it's like putting a
fork through your eyelash it's it's got
these really wide spread apart bristles
and it's like it's not doesn't even
touch the lashes they're so like all
over the place like how do you even coat
all of your lashes cuz lashes are you
know they're pretty close together but
the spacing of it it's just ridiculous
it's a if I remember correctly it's also
a very wet mascara so getting it to
actually get on the lashes and coat them
evenly is basically impossible in my
opinion I've had the worst time with
this mascara if you love this mascara
please know that I'm not insulting you
please know that I'm not saying there's
anything wrong with you I love you and I
think you're fabulous but I hated this
mascara and I'm just putting my heart
out there and if you disagree with me
it's totally okay with me leave a
comment down below and let me know why
you love this mascara because I
absolutely hated it and I will never
forget this mascara just because of how
expensive it was and how much Rochas it
was this is what I actually have yeah
okay I bought this recently this is the
Revlon youth effects concealer it's the
fill and blur concealer and this is in
the shade light this if you're gonna say
something's gonna feel and blur you
might want to make it a little thicker
it's in order to fill it has to have
some kind of substance and this is a
really really watery concealer let me
see if I can get it to come out it's a
click thing and then you put it on I
don't know if you can see that but it's
really really really watery like it's
not not watery but it's just very thin
especially when you blend it out it
almost is like a cream to powder almost
which I don't like under my under eyes
because then what happens is it
ends up creasing and it shows a texture
and I really don't like that I like the
concept of it with the click pen and the
little sponge I've seen that before in
other packaging but this formula is just
not good especially for what it's
marketed as and I think that's what your
takes me most about this product is that
it's supposed to be fill and blur and it
definitely does not do that if anything
it accentuates my fine lines under my
eyes and any texture that I have it is
just it's not good it's not good
speaking of texture just go off-topic
for a quick second last video I did put
a filter over the video and I ended up
feeling really bad about it I tweeted
out like okay you guys have got to tell
me if I need to stop using these filters
because I got so many compliments on my
skin what foundation are you using and
I'm sitting there thinking like because
I'm like oh my gosh it's not real it
wasn't my real skin so I have decided
that I'm not gonna use the filters
anymore because I just I don't want
people to think that that's real like I
was only using them in videos like that
where I wasn't reviewing anything on my
face like I would never do it in a
review video where I want you to see you
know the way the eye shadow looks or the
way especially the way I foundation
looks or skincare oh my gosh I was just
using it in videos like that and what's
up in makeup I don't think I'm gonna use
them anymore
even though I personally like the way
that they look I don't want you to be
misled and thinking of my skin really
looks like that when it doesn't so even
though I like it I'm not gonna do it
anymore so I just want to let you know
give you an update on that alright back
to the products this one's really really
bad this was sent to me by Ofra a long
time ago and this one's this is bad it's
really bad this is the over pressed
powder oil control and the reason why
this is bad is because it basically
looks like baby powder on the face I
can't even imagine if someone was deeper
than me how this would look I don't know
if you can see let me see if I can put
it hmm I don't know if you're gonna be
able to see but when you put it on the
skin it actually gives a white cast and
it's terrible now I don't have oil on my
face where I can test the oil control
nests but it doesn't look good on my
skin it is just white it ends up giving
like this white creepy ghosty look and I
mean it's not good it's not
I did get it from over a long time ago
so maybe they've changed up the formula
a bit since they gave it to me but but
yeah this is definitely a note for me I
just realized how many products there
are here from Revlon I didn't do that on
purpose I just sorted it by the top
rated and then I went to the last page
but there's a lot of Revlon stuff in
here
this one is the ultimate all-in-one
waterproof mascara I don't have this one
anymore
this one just didn't do anything for me
it wasn't particularly bad in any way
other than it just didn't mascara my
lashes didn't make them length more
length it didn't give them more volume
nothing so it was just it you know it
just didn't do anything so that's that's
a big note this one here this is the
Revlon Colorstay liquid eye pad triple
edged I actually bought a bunch of these
Revlon eyeliners and the thinner ones
really aren't bad my deal with this one
in particular is that it's very very
thick and I find it very difficult to
get a fin line because that's not really
what it's meant for it's meant for a
thick line and that's just not my
personal preference
I don't enjoy my eyeliner to look super
thick I don't think it looks good on me
so this one is just more of a personal
preference thing also there's no way to
do a wing with this at least at my skill
level because it is such a thick tip
just not functional
it also smeared this formula all of the
pens that I bought from this line were
also very smeary like if I accidentally
you know I had an itch when I and I
wasn't thinking about it and I wiped the
side of my eye I just eyeliner is just
everywhere it's awful so yeah that one's
gonna be a big no as well this one I
sort of have I have a full size but this
one was the one that's low rated is the
travel size they don't have the travel
size but I can't tell you about the full
size and this is another one that I've
talked about on my channel before this
is the Urban Decay troublemaker mascara
it's brand new when I first got it and
if you've heard me talk about this
before I apologize for the repeat but
some people may not have heard this it
smells awful at least when I first got
it now it's kind of aired out a little
bit it doesn't smell nearly as bad but
just like the Revlon one I would I would
use these interchangeably with the
Revlon one because this one does just
about as much is that terrible Revlon
one it doesn't do anything for me it
doesn't give me length it doesn't give
me volume well maybe it gives me that's
not true it does give me a little bit of
length but no volume and it's not worth
the price the sample size is a
eleven dollars I forgot how much the
full-size is but this is definitely a no
the packaging is gorgeous it's beautiful
it's just the formula is not good the
brush is fine the wand is fine there's
nothing I mean it's kind of spiky but I
don't find it to be ultra pokey or
anything but yeah it's just it's just
not good for me it doesn't do anything I
need my mascara to give me some oomph I
got little wimpy lashes and kind of give
me something give me something to make
my lashes go boom you know this is one I
recently talked about in a favorites and
fails video this is the woosh Beauty
eyeliner wheel my biggest complaint
about this is the price point the price
point is stupid on this this is a $29
piece of plastic that's ridiculous I
think I'm charging $10 for this I would
still think that was overpriced for a
piece of plastic but at least it seems
reasonable what you're supposed to do
with this is you're supposed to roll it
into a gel liner and you're supposed to
apply it like right there on your lash
line and then there's a brush on the
other side the brush on the other side
is actually quite nice I do enjoy the
brush but the roller wheel I can't get a
wing out of it I feel like it is
difficult too difficult for me to use
this beyond my skill level to do a wing
because there is no taper there it's
just all one one thickness so I can get
it really nice on my lash line but I
can't get a wing out of it I don't think
they advertise that you can do a wing
with this so that's fine but anyway I
feel like this product is more trouble
than it's worth
I feel like using this brush is so much
easier that there's no real point to
using the wheel and you can get a brush
like this for much cheaper and just know
it's it's just it's a big big big no
unfortunately another mascara the sole
ashy mascara by covergirl this is one
that I did throw out just the one is
super gimmicky again does nothing just
nothing it does nothing and it made me
sad because I was really excited because
James Charles was part of the campaign
for this and back then you know this
you've just become the first male
covergirl and I thought that was so cool
and that was why I bought it and it the
mascara was awful
it's not good with mascaras one thing I
want to mention since I have mentioned a
few mascaras I don't usually have
problems with flaking and smudging on my
lashes I don't know why it doesn't
matter the mascara
I don't have problems with flaking and
smudging so I can't really speak to that
when it comes to mascaras if it's gonna
flake and smudge on me it's really
really bad none of these mascaras have
flaked and smudged on me but that
doesn't mean it won't on you if that
makes sense I don't have particularly
watery eyes and I've heard whatever
reason a lot of mascaras don't flake on
me I don't know why it's very weird but
yeah I did want to mention that because
I know that they're gonna be questions
about that so if you've tried any of
these mascaras and they have flaked or
smudged on you definitely leave it in
the comments below so we can all learn
from you on those points and the last
one is another product that I have
mentioned on the channel before it is
the tattoo junkies lip paints I bought a
bunch of these because I was gonna do a
full review on them because I thought
they were so cool the ones that are the
lowest rated are the velvet lip paints
here's one of the velvet loose powders
or whatever they're basically like
shimmer eyeshadows but their lips safe
and what you do is you put on the liquid
lipstick and then you tap it over your
lips to give you a like a velvet finish
or they have ones that are like sugar
where they're like um you know they look
like sugar on your lips just to give
really cool instagrammy lip effects the
liquid lipsticks are so insanely drying
they flake they're very uncomfortable I
can handle a relatively dry liquid
lipstick and be okay these I couldn't
even handle like it was so uncomfortable
that I had to put something over top and
or completely remove it in order to go
through my day it was just insanely
uncomfortable the lip effects the the
one that is the lowest rated I actually
didn't hate as much as the ones that
were like the sugar ones the ones that
were um the ones that were like the
glittery ones and it's just because of
the nature of them that they would get
to get in your mouth and then you chomp
on them and it's like eating sand it's
just very uncomfortable so if you're
going to buy these I would recommend
buying them specifically for like
Instagram looks or Halloween coming up
something like that but with you know an
everyday day kind of look it's just not
functional because of the comfort level
at least in my opinion the flakiness and
you know eating the product by accident
which is disgusting if as you are
watching
video you had strong feelings about
really loving or really hating any of
these products I would love to know your
thoughts down in the comments below we
