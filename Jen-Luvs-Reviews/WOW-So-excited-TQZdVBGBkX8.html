interesting podcast she doesn't usually

50,000 subscribers she usually
interviews channels that are much much
bigger than me so feel very honored that
she wanted to interview me and part of
the reason why she want to interview me
was because of you because of the
community that you have helped me to
build here the what's up and make up
family on facebook on periscope on
Instagram on on what else where also our
way on the the wets of a makeup appt on
whatsapp eye makeup calm I mean any way
that you participate you are part of the
what's up in makeup community also in
our chats that we have weekly and
commenting underneath my videos I mean

able to share that information with her

podcast for you it is so good it's a
great thing to listen to on your car
