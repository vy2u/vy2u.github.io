work and I'm looking at the monitor I'm
gonna look at you I was inspired by Jung
Hwan and polished she did like a really
raw like video no editing don't say hi
were you showing what is that she'll
click Charlotte kicks chocolate chip
cookie chocolate chip cookie mix that he
got from his teachers today so i just
want to show you anyway Carrie go I
can't do it taco he's obsessed with
rhett and Link right now but anyway so I
was inspired by Johanna polish Nicole
she did like a really rough on edited
video and I got hey can I do my video
now they want to show them how to put it
okay real quick Sean oh la la that's
perfect good job okay I'm gonna show
them it's in my box you want to you want
to pull out the products out of the box
okay so I'm just gonna pull out I got
this today BAM so excited about this
hopefully it doesn't look backward i
think i might look backward if it does
i'm sorry about that not used to using
this camera but i want to show you this
so excited to get my walmart beauty box
and we'll open it yay and show you my
first reactions to everything and oh oh
I cannot wait this beauty box is five
dollars just for shipping until you pay
for and other than that it's free so
like so excite alright so there's the
box and just a little card whatever
doesn't look exciting okay so the first
thing in here our pond original fresh
wet cleansing towelettes okay sure they
like cleanser towelette thing so very
excited about those and yeah i'll have
to try those I've never tried these
before if you've tried before let me
know okay next thing loop is the aveeno
daily moisturizing lotion cool that's
always nice to have in the wintertime oh
oh sorry go ahead pull that out okay
don't know Wendy that's okay it's lotion
for your hands Danson's lotion for your
hands here we go okay what's next well
something else out very Pont a lot of
ponds in here a line
pine in here yes that's right this is
pond rejuven s the anti-wrinkle cream oh
by the way I get the old people one
there's young people one and an old
people when I think the cutoff for the
old people want is 35 it's like 35 and
up so I'm 35 36 36 so I get the older
one so that's why I get all the anti
wrinkle stuff alright so anti wrinkle
cream go next up what is that yeah net
nope NEX mean it's more tone perfecting
cream by all a very nice okay what's
next you know a lot of clean I know
there's a lot of cream as well I'm
saying what's that hey I legs on it does
have colors on it has pink on it it
looks like the l'oreal colour vibrancy
Nora sink nourishing a shampoo with
antioxidants so that's cool i love when
they say color vibrancy and then it's
got sulfates in it that stripped the
color out of your hair so let's see ah
any sulfates let's look um sodium
laureth sulfate in the shampoo so i'll
be using the other to be conditioned ER
and the antioxidant our side ok can I
finish shooting my video now please hmm
ok awesome so it's all probably be using
the other two products but I don't know
about the the shampoo I'll probably skip
that all right let's see what's next all
right a little nivea cocoa butter body
lotion very nice and then let's see what
this is ok this is age perfect cell
renewal golden serum and day cream from
l'oreal I know but you're drawing right
now I didn't think you wanted to do
anymore cuz he's drawing ok so this is
really like I'm very excited to have
this for five dollars very excited but I
might change my age so that i get the
younger people box because she only
needs so much anti aging stuff i don't
need to be reminded that much walmart
how old I am thank you at least put
something there doesn't have to do with
wrinkles that'd be nice alright and then
the last thing looks like in here is
another sample
uh I can't get it out oh it's stuck
that's why damned all right john frieda
luxurious volume shampoo and conditioner
and there's a coupon on the back and
that probably has sulfates in it too so
I probably won't be able to use that
either but at least I can use the
conditioner so for five dollars i think
we definitely got our money's worth I
mean this ponds alone is probably worth
the five dollars the anti-wrinkle cream
and then this Chum perfecting cream from
au lait and then this Nivea cocoa butter
cattail hello cat tail hello I've been
miss Nivea cocoa butter and then this
aveeno daily moisturizer I mean
everything is like girlfriend you dry
girlfriend you dry you need something to
reassure eyes because you're old and
you're dry so it's like come on be nice
to me and then the wet cleansing
towelettes and then the age perfect
self-renewal golden serum and then the
l'oreal shampoo color vibrancy because
we're old and we dye our hair because we
have gray hair so we need something to
keep that color in you know so yeah I
mean I am happy for five dollars but I
think I'm gonna tell him I'm 30 instead
of 36 so I get more other kinds of
things cuz I'm not happy with all this
reminding of how old I am so that's the
end of the video I hope you enjoyed it
thank you so much for watching mad love
and I'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
