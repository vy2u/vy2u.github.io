first wants of all unboxing and I will
tell you that I did not receive this for
promotional purposes I paid for this
outright and the reason why I pay for
this outright was because they got me on
involving my girl Melissa Raymond in the
the creation of this box she curated the
box shoot as she helped put it together
I guess I didn't ask her personally what
the deal was with it but her name is
included in this it was used to but she
used they used her name to promote it
she has excellent taste in makeup I love
her her dupes videos where you can find
dupes for high-end brand she's really
good at showing those talented at
putting on makeup and I just love her
personality she's hilarious so if you
don't know Melissa's videos i will put a
link down below and i definitely
recommend checking those out as always
though i will be honest about what i
find inside they do have you do it
wantable as they have you go through in
your style profile and pick out products
like say which products you like bridge
products you love which products types
that you don't want in your box and the
first thing i find inside is this text
and it says a beautiful new thing and
then and it says packed especially for
and then it has my full name there's a
little sticker there which i think is
really cute right there it says be your
own kind of beautiful and that's how it
looks on the inside it says your june
makeup box featuring Melissa Raymond but
that is not a picture of Melissa
Raymond's so the first thing I see is a
little makeup bag and it looks like it's
got a pocket here and a silica gel and
there you go this would be a nice little
clutch to carry out which I like I have
a ridiculous amount of makeup bag so i
will probably use this as a little
clutch for going out i think it is
appropriate for that it is a little
cheap looking i wouldn't wear this to
anything formal or carry the singing
formal but for just a regular night out
jeans and a t-shirt this is something i
would definitely use and then this is
what is underneath ah the first thing it
looks like I've got a few products from
Mirabella this one is a pic to color
palette this is cute so it
like a little palette for eyeshadow it's
got a little magnet there and then they
gave us two eyeshadows so this one is in
cultured and this one is in serenity I'm
going to pop these babies out and swatch
them okay so what I've done is I've
removed the eyeshadows from the
packaging and I put them in the little
case here so this one is a purple and
then a champagne color they look pretty
Matt let's watch them and see not super
creamy but not powdery either so those
are the finger swatches hand swatches um
to play with them and see let me see if
I can build them up a bit okay so here's
second swatch of purple there we go
second swatch of the cream the champagne
there we go very nice so that's actually
really nice I kind of prefer a buildable
color rather than one that just goes on
super pigmented because if it goes on
super pigmented sometimes it's really
difficult to blend and you might not get
the right amount of product on there
sometimes it's just really nice to have
a light color at first and then be able
to build it up so it looks like these
shadows are like that i'm blending with
my finger right now and it is not
blending out meaning that it's not going
away as i blend with my hand so that
makes me very very happy i'm excited to
try these on the eyeballs and then next
we got the ncl a los angeles and nail
lacquer okay this is an interesting
color it's called the spa comes to me
and it's like a muddy green like a spa
mask green let me do a little drip test
and see looks like a 12 to cope polish
it looks really nice actually eyes at CL
a drugstore I don't know I know NYC is
drugstore I don't think ncla is drug
store now thinking about it enjoy a
little California love on your
fingertips well this actually looks like
a really nice nail polish I'm excited to
try that cool okay and then the last
thing I got I'm excited about is vincent
longo I don't know any products by
vincent longo gom products by vincent
longo is it good I don't know anything
about it and
that is that and it's in golden sienna
and it's a pressed powder and that's
what it looks like inside cheap little
powder puff in here doesn't look
impressive to me whenever I find one of
these in there I'm like Oh mm I don't
know about that okay and then there it
is looks like a nice skin to a match
when it said golden sienna I was
expecting a golden like bronzer but this
looks like just like a pressed powder
look feels very creamy there's that yeah
just like a regular press powder day so
creamy was probably not the word I was
looking for more like soft it's like
super soft is very silky feeling does it
say anything about it no oh no let's see
if it says anything here one of the
sophos lace weight powders available in
compact form by triple milling the
powder and using real silk fibers the
powder becomes ultra fine and smooth to
the touch large mirrored compact is
great for touching up your makeup on the
go blends completely into foundation and
concealer leaving no residue for totally
invisible finish observed surface oil
sets foundation concealer to maintain a
smooth matte canvas throughout the day I
am cheek color glide on over the press
powder color will not streep ok so the
retail value on this is twenty-eight
dollars retail value on the makeup bag
with sixteen dollars I would never pay
sixteen dollars for this this is like
maybe 10 bucks and then the nail polish
is 16 and then the Mirabella mere belair
Mirabella duo color and cultured and
serenity are thirty dollars I don't know
if that includes I would hope that that
would include this because there's no
way that would pay fifteen dollars a
piece for an eyeshadow I don't know I
guess that's like what max shadows are
right I do think that this whole thing
together is probably worth thirty
dollars i mean it's a really nice little
compact and it looks like it will fit
other shadows in there I don't own any
mac shadows to put in there
unfortunately but you know my zeep Alex
I know them the makeup geek shadows are
the same size as the mac shadow so I'm
curious to see me put a makeup geek
shadow and this is shimmer mint and it
does fit so these will fit Mac shadows
push the edge lightly with my fingernail
and it popped right out cool so it would
be nice to be able to customize this
little one for travel or on the go
alright so that's the wonderful unboxing
on it
like 40 bucks I don't know about forty
dollars when I think about four dollar
subscription I think about new Beauty
test tube and how many products come in
there I just don't feel like this one is
as rich of a subscription as new Beauty
test tube and you don't get as many
products to try but I you know then
being full size I guess that makes kind
of the big difference so we got two
three things here for things here are
five things here are six things here so
40 bucks what do you guys think I'd love
to know in the comments below and thank
you so much for watching by the way I
appreciate it and if you enjoy this
video make sure you give it a thumbs up
makes me look super cool and also makes
you subscribe if you've never seen one
of my videos before hi it's nice to meet
you and I hope you stick around mad love
my friends and I will see you in a video
