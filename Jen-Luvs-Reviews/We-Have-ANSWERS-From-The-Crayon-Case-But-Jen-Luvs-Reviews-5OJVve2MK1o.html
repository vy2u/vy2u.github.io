few months you may remember my review on
the box of crayons I shadow palette this
is by a brand called the crayon case we
had a lot of questions after I had a lot
of questions and then we collectively
had a lot of questions and I constantly
still get questions on that video did
they ever answer you did they ever
answer the questions you had I finally
got some answers and I really wanted to
share those with you so that you can
make your own judgment I felt like that
video was never complete until I got
these answers so now we can wrap it up
in a little bow with our answers maybe
maybe not you have to decide for
yourself hang tight starting right now
if you did not see the box of crayons
review that I did it was very very very
long it was one of my longer videos it
was about 40 41 minutes long and that
was due to me doing for wear test for
the product I had planned to do three
but the eyeshadow primer was really bad
from the first two wear test so I
decided I wanted to add a fourth wear
test to really give this the best shot
possible if you didn't see that video
right now I'm gonna show you some clips
from that video just so you can get an
idea of what was said in that video so
that you know where the brand was coming
from and where I was coming from so I
can give you that complete story so go
ahead and check that out now timestamps
down below if you've already seen all
this so a little bit about the technical
stuff so if you look on the back here
hopefully you'll be able to see there is
the little PETA Bunny here but I could
not find that they were cruelty free
anywhere on their website so I do have a
question in to them along with some
other questions that we'll be getting to
on Twitter they have been commenting
back to some of my posts on Twitter so
I'm thinking this will be a great way to
get in touch with them and I will update
you on their answers as soon as I can so
we're working on finding out whether the
entire brand is cruelty free or if it's
just the shadows it's also written on
the eyeshadow primer that we're gonna be
talking about it says animal cruelty
free and hypoallergenic product on the
bottom here the other thing we don't
know is where the products are made
there's nothing on here that says made
in the United States made in the
PRC anything like that I I did ask that
question I'm assuming based on the price
point of $30 which is really inexpensive
and ten dollars here for the eyeshadow
primer I'm thinking it must be People's
Republic of China that's what I'm
thinking but we have no confirmation on
that yet I will let you know one thing
that's really really important is they
do not accept returns exchanges or
refunds and all sales are final I don't
know what that means as far as damaged
products I'm gonna ask her that as well
the other thing is is that they do not
say anywhere on the website how big the
pans are so that's another question that
I have in to find out which hopefully
will be in the next segment for the next
eyeshadow look okay now let's get into
the eyeshadow primer how adorable is
this eyeshadow primer I forgot to
mention about the ingredients is there
are quite a few typos that are both on
the bottle and also on the website for
example there's a ingredient in here
called enter inin a and I couldn't find
a single thing online about that
ingredient so I'm thinking it might be a
typo they also have something called you
so purified water
they've misspelled the word
phenoxyethanol they've also misspelled
methylparaben and ethyl paraben so I am
I'm I've I've got some questions and
about that especially about the in Turin
and one because I don't know I can't
find anything about that ingredient and
I want to know what it is I want to
mention is that I did reach out to the
crayon case what is it today's the 16th
so four days ago on Twitter did not hear
anything back yesterday I sent them a
standard message through their website
still haven't heard anything back so
that doesn't mean that they're
neglecting me on purpose they may just
be really busy when I hear something if
I ever hear something I will I will put
something in the description box about
it either I haven't heard anything yet
or what their response is on the
different things I'm sorry I don't have
that information for you I do wish that
they had gotten back to me but they
haven't so I don't have that info for
you so this was back in February it is
now April one of my subscribers actually
tagged me on Instagram that she was
trying to talk to the crayon case about
answering my questions and it really
felt to me like
were writing me off as kind of a hater
as someone who just wanted to slander
them which is definitely not who I am
it's not what I want to do all I care
about is giving you the truth that's why
I wanted to make this clarification
video so the way that this started the
way I finally got my answers was that I
was skimming through Instagram which I
rarely do Instagram was my least
favorite social media platform that I
participate in I saw the owner of the
crayon case had made a Instagram video
so I clicked on it to watch it and start
talking about you know how there was a
misspelling on some of their new
packaging where they had misspelled
distributed by they had spelled it as
disturbed and that you know they didn't
want anyone making video you know that
people you know YouTube beauty bloggers
or detectives and they didn't want
anyone making a video about it and
people being confused so they wanted to
kind of throw it out there okay let me
go get some water real quick I I gotta
get someone hold on a second all right
hold on in here okay and then in the the
video and like the description of the
post it says something about a 41 minute
video she didn't directly call me out
but you can tell me another 41 minute
video that was made on the box crayons
eyeshadow palette I would love to know
about it
and it was kind of confirmed in the
comments that I'll show you some screen
captures of later that she was speaking
about me so this is the thing I would
never never in a million years think
that that was a huge deal the difference
between disturbed and distributed it's
obvious what it means that we're talking
distributed where I do have a problem
with misprints on packaging is when
ingredients are so badly spelled that
you can't even tell what it is and in
the case of inter and then which was one
of my issues I couldn't I couldn't find
any information on that at all to me it
felt condescending I don't know her
heart so I don't know if she meant it to
be condescending but to me the the post
felt very condescending and belittling
toward me and because her the people
commenting under the video seemed to be
familiar with what she was talking about
I wouldn't be surprised as she has made
multiple posts over the past few months
at least one other post regarding my
video I mean this is while I'm sitting
here waiting of having asked multiple
questions on Twitter having reached out
in their contact page and having
received no response that she would
rather go on her Instagram and kind of
talk about you know her feelings about
the situation without addressing the
situation I commented back she mentioned
in the comments down under the video no
one said anything yet lol we just wanted
to address at first before they come
with the 41 minute YouTube videos again
and I said back and I'll put the screen
capture right here I emailed you through
your contact page and messaged you on
Twitter regarding questions I had
regarding ingredient typos including one
that I couldn't even identify can you
please respond to one of those messages
I still get questions about whether or
not you have answered I am NOT a hater
trying to expose anything I just want a
clarification and don't know why you
never responded and then I said in an
additional post by the way that 41
minute video was a near rave review of
your product her response was oh that's
what you called it we learned something
new every day and then a little pencil
emoji and a heart and that was an ear
rave review my big critique of it was
the one-line shade I felt felt like was
a little bit weak and that the eyeshadow
primer was a little tricky to work with
did you have to use the tiniest amount
but other than that the actual product
review what's glowing so in response to
the my said I emailed them she says back
the contact pad specified to email us
directly due to us having issues with
our contact system if I had seen that if
I mean I I was trying to get in touch
with them legitimately so if that was
prominently displayed on that page at
that time I don't have a screen capture
I didn't know she was gonna pull this
card so I did I don't have a screenshot
of that page but a contact page was
active or else I wouldn't have used it
you know cuz I really wanted to know
she says also Twitter our Twitter
account isn't hardly as active as our
Instagram considering we followed you
the whole considering we followed you
basically it's inactive and that's why
we're still following you but if it
wasn't inactive we wouldn't be following
you kind of thing okay all right that's
your choice a DM would have been
appreciated as well basically if you
would and reached out on our favorite
social media platform we probably would
have responded if I had known the
Instagram would have been the best way
to get in touch with them I definitely
would have but I felt like reaching out
on two different ways through their
personal through their website contact
page and through Twitter it was
sufficient I guess it wasn't she says we
never responded because we never
received any emails on Twitter or
messages from you you can email you can
directly email customer service at the
Crayon case comm so that was what I
ended up doing I said in the video that
I reached out to them on Twitter if she
had watched the video she would know
that I tried to reach out on Twitter and
would have hopefully responded to my
questions
I shouldn't have to jump through hoops
to get a brand to respond to questions
you know what I mean I shouldn't have to
know that her favorite social media is
Instagram feel like as a brand you
should be checking all of your social
media and a message shouldn't be sitting
in your Twitter inbox for months without
being addressed you know what I mean
I did respond back I will put that here
I won't read this whole long thing as
far as what I said back about the
contact page basically I just said it to
you but I don't think she respond to
that because I don't have a screenshot
of it and I think if she had I would
have screenshotted that as well and just
some other notes of her conversing with
other people here's another one where
someone said who the reported this I'm I
am weak AF and they say back nobody lol
we just said at first before they come
with the forty minute YouTube videos
lmao save a thing another one oMG people
are so petty and they say back yes but
you'll be surprised
lmao but we love all our cuties even the
over analyzers so even though they
wouldn't follow me on Twitter apparently
they love me anyway so you know I don't
know if that was sarcastic I have a
feeling that maybe it was I don't know
again I don't know her heart I don't
know what she's thinking but as you can
see in the next screenshot they
have deleted when I clicked on the link
from my my Instagram notifications
they've deleted my post and their own
posts so now let's go ahead and go into
what they said to me in the email so you
can hear what their answers are and see
if that's sufficient enough for you I'm
not gonna tell you what to think how to
feel but what I ended up doing was I
took my tweets that I'd sent them and I
copied and pasted them into an email to
their customer service so that they
could answer those original questions I
didn't reformat them or anything and
then this way too you can see how I had
format formed those questions it wasn't
in any kind of rude way at least in my
opinion
it didn't seem rude I was just trying to
gather information so number one they do
say that there are cruelty free brands
and that the PETA logo has been added to
all pages on their website and their
companies also listen under the PETA
organization when I clicked on the link
provided yes they are now listed under
PETA if you did see my video with
Courtney who is known as Phoenix on
YouTube she we did talk about PETA
certification and I'm not saying that
this is the crayon case I am not saying
that they are not cruelty free but
basically PETA for their to get the PETA
bunny illegally on your packaging all
you need to do is promise to be cruelty
free so anyone that does have that PETA
Bunny they can anybody can be PETA
certified really and truly it is 100%
possible that they are truly 100%
cruelty free so the second message was
all about the packaging my question was
how many how much do each of the pans
away and also where was it manufactured
so they say back our weight has been
listed has been listed on all of our
packaging
this wasn't listed on the first
production which is what I had purchased
but immediately added after the net
weight is 63 grams two point two ounces
also our products are manufactured in
China all which is located on our new
packaging was i nitpicking on the fact
that it wasn't on there no I just wanted
the information if they if they didn't
put on the buy I just wanted the
information for the video all right now
this is the one that seems to have poked
the bear the most for lack of a better
term you know they seem to be the most
upset about this or supa or you know
people over the crankies I said your
eyeshadow primer has an ingredient that
I don't recognize
enter inin
is that a typo you have fffe paraben
listed but I assume you meant ethyl
paraben I think when it comes to
ingredients I feel like the ingredients
need to be sopes spelled correctly for
clarity for the consumer that is my
personal opinion what I personally think
happened is I think that this is my
thoughts this is no proof behind it
my thoughts are is that this
manufacturer in China expected them to
proofread the ingredients they did not
do this so they just printed whatever
they had on there so I feel like
personally that was a ball dropped by
the brand but I did not say that in
correspondence with them because I
wasn't trying to be nitpicky I just
wanted to know what inter Ihnen was and
I said they're basically the reason why
I talked about the misspelling of ethyl
paraben was because I wanted to say I
noticed there's some other things
misspelled so maybe this is a
misspelling as well can you tell me what
it is so this is their response FA
paraben and ethyl paraben is the same
ingredient just written a different way
as explained by our manufacturer this is
how they spell it an FDA recognizes it
this ingredient is spelled this way on
hundreds of products not just ours we
don't see any problem with the way it's
spelled since is recognized and FDA
approved okay I do have a problem with
this and do do do this for me and see if
this this is what happens to you because
this is what happened to me when I typed
in I'll put the word here at the paraben
the first thing that came up was this
and then a couple of other products made
in they look to be made in China I
didn't do a lot of digging but they were
not popular mainstream or even popular
indie brands that had that were popping
up in the search so I don't know if I
believe that and I hate to say I don't
believe that I looked on ewg of all
places will give you a list of different
names that are synonyms for that product
and epi paraben is not according I'll
put a screenshot up is not a synonym for
ethyl paraben so to me I don't know I
don't think that that's true that's just
my opinion
not having verified that with the FDA
but if they want to use an uncommon
spelling of an ingredient
that's up to them they can choose to do
that if they want and if they say that
it's FDA recognized that's fine
personally if this were my brand which
it is absolutely not if it were my brand
I would want the most common spelling
used on my packaging to avoid any kind
of confusion that's just to me she says
we had the choice to revise this but we
chose not to since we've been cleared by
the FDA okay I'm gonna put a screen shot
of from my last video of all of the
misspellings that are on this too but so
do it so I want to make sure this is
very clear
do I care that they did disturbed
instead of tribute and distributed do I
think anybody should care no but
ingredients I think are important and I
think twisting it to try to make that 40
one-minute video creator look bad and to
make them look good
bothers me it's that's wrong with me
personally one more thing to clear to
finish that up she says the ingredient
list comes directly from the factory
system
I think the factory system is wrong that
is that is my thought and then she says
antonin is one kind of glycerin this
ingredient has no harm to the face and
is also material friendly I don't know
what material friendly means if you know
a material friendly means I would love
to know so I'm gonna go ahead and type
and enter in in and see if I get
something different will say entering in
cosmetics whoa let's do glycerin okay I
can't I still can't find anything I mean
the first page is not in English I died
tea so it must be Italian the next one
is a Washington Times article August 2nd
- 1908 this is not cosmetic stuff here
so I mean this is something is not this
is not right I'm so confused I mean
maybe it's something in another language
maybe it's an ingredient in an in
Italian I'll just say again if I were
the brand I wouldn't have responded that
way that's just that's just my I'm not
the brand though again I'm not the brand
message for was the one that I had the
least amount of problem with the answer
for so I said I was really just asking
about the return policy because it
basically said that they did not accept
returns so this is the answer if we're
product is received damaged the customer
has 48 hours to email us their order
number a photo of the damaged item and a
photo of their packing slip so just so
you know that's what you need to do we
then send the customer of return label
to send the damaged item back and we
will send out a new product if you
receive a damaged item please let us
know and we will send you another so
that is the process just you know if
it's past 48 hours I guess that you you
cannot do return of a damaged items so
just be aware of that I mean do I love
that return policy no but do I see any
problem with their answer no not at all
I I still stand by that I really like
this eyeshadow palette I really like the
quality of it I like the eyeshadow
primer I don't love the eyeshadow primer
but I like it this is where I'm laying
right now as far as reviewing this brand
in the future for future releases I
don't think it's necessarily a good idea
and I don't I don't want it to look like
I'm picking on them I want I all I want
is fairness and and I don't know I mean
I could see why people want me to review
their products so that I do dig this
deep and so that I can tell you any
concerns I might have but I also don't
want to like go after the broad you know
like I'm not trying to do that so I
don't know I'm not I'm not a hundred
percent decided on whether I will review
any of their products in the future I
don't like the way that supe talked to
me I'm just reviewing things the way I
always review them and if there are
questions I ask them I think that's my
right as a consumer and a YouTube
reviewer without the brand being you
know writing me off as a hater and I
don't know that she did that for a fact
but that's the way it felt to me and you
know again I don't know her heart so I
don't know but that's the way it felt
especially like with the dig about
Twitter of like that's why we follow you
on there that's the way I interpreted it
and the whole I don't want you buddy
make a forty one-minute video again and
it just it just sits wrong with me
you know and it's kind of I don't know
it's just weird
it's just weird but I I would never tell
you not to order from them if you feel
comfortable ordering from them and you
would like to order from them please do
I would love to hear about it I would
love to know your thoughts but you can
always leave it in the comments of my
videos if you you know tried something
and you want to share it with me I would
love to know and if you have any
requests for me to review some of their
products in the future I definitely take
requests I don't know from when
do it though yeah so that's my video for
today I hope you enjoyed it I hope it
was clarifying a shirt is I from Philip
DeFranco I actually have another one of
his shirts than be wearing in a video
very very soon
it says my mom thinks I'm advertiser
friendly and so hopefully that one will
be up next week I just you know I felt
kind of chilled today so yeah and we
want to wake up sheeple we want to make
sure we're not just following people
blindly we want to make sure we're
thinking for ourselves being critical of
what we see and making the decision
that's right for us and I thought that
was appropriate for this video so thank
you so much for watching if you enjoyed
the content definitely make sure you hit
the subscribe button down below and mad
love to you and I will see you in a
video calling out about the crayon case
very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
