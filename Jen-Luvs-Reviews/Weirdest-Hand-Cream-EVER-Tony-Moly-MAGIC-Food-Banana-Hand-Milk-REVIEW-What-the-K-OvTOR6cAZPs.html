the K where we test out Korean beauty
products to decide whether they're worth
your time and money today we're testing
out a banana and this did possibly be
the weirdest thing you will ever pull
out of your purse or bag some people are
going to be like what but is it worth it
that's what we're going to find out
right now this is the Tony moly
but now magic hand food milk is that
right no let's see if I can memorize it
Tony moly banana hand milk food no
that's not right either I can't memorize
this this is why I was never an actress
Tony moly magic food banana hand milk
I've got it this is a que beauty product
it is a hand cream and the first thing I
thought of was how funny would it be if
I was like just sitting you know in
class if I was still in school or at
work if I still had a job or you know
just sitting out at a restaurant or
something and just pulled this thing out
and just started like putting it on my
hands he'll be like what I think this is
one of the best talking point products I
have ever reviewed it is so stinking
cute it looks like a little mini banana
I did bring a real banana up here so you
can see the size difference it is quite
different I mean it's it's not a real
size of a banana unless you I've seen
many bananas in the store these are
probably about the same size as the mini
bananas that I've seen like once in the
grocery store it wasn't $9.99 for this
which I feel like is a lot to pay for a
hand cream of this size it's only 45
grams which really isn't a whole lot
it's not like a really small amount but
it's not a ton of product for 9.99 but
once we get into the ingredients I feel
like it might be justified so let's talk
a little bit about what's in this
there's 16 ingredients total which is
not a whole lot for a k-beauty product
which is does not bother me I don't mind
the number it's how good quality they
are so number one ingredient is water
second is glycerin third is shea butter
and then we have an artificial
moisturizer that I can't
then we have coconut oil butylene glycol
and macadamia nut oil and then there's a
bunch of other stuff including milk
protein extract so if you are not a milk
person you definitely do not want to use
this it's not vegan just a little bit
about glycerin and kind of a warning for
this the research is kind of mixed on
glycerin some people seem to really like
it and some people don't I talked about
it quite a few times what the research
says is that this is a humectant and
what it does is it pulls moisture out of
the air and into your skin but if there
isn't at least 70% humidity around you
what it'll do is it'll point pull
moisture up from the lower layers of
your skin and pull it to the top so
it'll feel like your hands or your skin
wherever you put this is moisturize when
really it is dehydrating the lower
layers of your skin which is not good so
definitely keep that in mind about this
product other ingredients I wanted to
mention are the banana fruit extract
there's actually some research behind
the banana fruit extract is good for
helping with inflammation so I would
imagine if you do have humidity in your
and a winter time and your hands are
really dry and inflamed that this would
be really good also your Rhea settle so
many comments every time I bring up urea
isn't that your in no it's not your in
there in urea in urine but urea used in
cosmetic products is traditionally
synthetic it's not from urine I'm not
going to guarantee that this isn't use
isn't from real urine but I would
seriously doubt it
cosmetic urea is not it's not urine its
job is also to be a humectant but it
also helps all of the other good
ingredients to sink into the skin it
helps everything penetrate the skin
better which is really good there is no
artificial fragrance in here which
really surprised me because the smell of
this is kind of ridiculous it's got this
little teeny tiny squirt bottle kind of
thing I almost reminds me of a mustard
bomb with the color and the way that it
comes out is like this so it's just a
little squirt of product which makes it
very easy to control so that you're not
wasting a lot my least favorite thing
about a lotion is when it's got the open
top and I feel like I just end up
spilling it all over my hands and I
don't need that much so you just need a
tiny little bit and this is probably
well that was almost enough
my hands to feel good let's use just a
little bit more but the set of this like
I was saying before I was talking about
how it came out
the scent of it it smells it smells just
like banana scented runts if you've ever
had run candy I'll put a picture here or
Laffy Taffy's any kind of artificial
banana scent is exactly what it smells
like as you saw it's not a milk I was
expecting it to be really thin and milky
especially there's milk in the
ingredients and it says it's a hand milk
but there's it's not milky at all it's
quite thick actually it seeps into the
hands very very quickly
there isn't any oiliness to it my hands
just right now feel very hydrated they
feel really really good I have used this
quite a few times at this point because
I knew that I was going to review it
this was something really easy that's
just throw onto my hands and what I've
noticed is that the scent lingers pretty
well for a while but I would say after
like 10 to 15 minutes I can only smell
it if I'm like consciously trying to
smell it and after a couple of hours I
can't smell it at all especially if I
wash my hands of course you can't smell
it at all I feel like the hydration
being someone with normal skin and not
dry skin will last me two to three hours
before I don't feel hydrated I don't
feel dehydrated if they don't feel the
way that I feel right now you know like
it's kind of lost its magic a little bit
but I mean is it truly magical no is it
good do I really like it a lot
absolutely is it a fun product
absolutely do I recommend it absolutely
I like the ingredients ingredients
aren't magical they're relatively
typical but I do like the ingredients
especially if you're in a higher
humidity area because of how much
glycerin is in this product I mean it's
the number two ingredient so I
definitely wouldn't recommend this if
you're in a dry environment but if you
were in a more hydrated environment with
lots of humidity in the air this is a
definite win for me it's a really fast
what decay this week I hope you enjoyed
