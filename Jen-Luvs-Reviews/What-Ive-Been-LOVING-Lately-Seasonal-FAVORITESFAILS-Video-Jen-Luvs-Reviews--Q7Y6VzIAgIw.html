favorites video I am so excited for this
video I've been waiting all summer to do
this and now that I'm officially back to
work as a teacher summer is officially
over for me I want to tell you about all
the products I've been absolutely loving
this summer and some other things thrown
in as well so in no particular order
here are my summer favorite the first
thing I want to tell you about is the
cocoa brightening mask mask by wonder
ruchi and I got this in my cocoa Mimi
box and I love this stuff it smells like
fudge it looks like fudge it kind of
tastes like fudge I have to say I did
end up tasting it this is just a really
fun product to play with it feels very
warm on this game which is a little bit
freaky but I've really enjoyed playing
with this and I feel like I don't know
if it has any effects on my skin I don't
have a lot of skin problems so it's hard
to say whether this actually does
anything to my skin or would do anything
for your skin but it really is awfully
fun to use I get so consumed by the
chocolate experience that I forget to
pay attention to my skin X product i
want to show you are these rimmel
lipsticks and I think these are a new
formula I really really like them a lot
there the moisture new lipsticks I got
two of them I got 125 into nude or not
to nude and then I got number 6 30 in
coral Britannia I really really like
these for the creaminess of them my
friend Emily over at lestats beauty
really liked them as well they're just
so moisturizing they have a nice lasting
power not fantastic not overly amazing
lasting power but I mean it's a nice
lasting power on them they definitely
won't last you eating but they do last
as long as you're not messing with your
lips for a significant amount of time
this is the two nude or not to noon and
you can see it's got a little bit of a
frost to it but I don't mind a little
bit of a frost this is the coral
brittania one boat are very natural
looking colors on me I happen to really
like my lip color right now so I'm not
going to take it off right now but I
mean that's exactly the way that it
looks on the lips I really really enjoy
them they're not super uber pigmented
but that's the way I like my lip
products so if you like your lip
products a little more natural then this
is definitely a formula you might want
to check out they're just super creamy
and really enjoy them a lot next up is
by rim also and this is the rim Bowl
mumble Rimmel scandaleyes rocking curves
mascara this is the craziest wand look
at this thing gimmicky gimmicky gimmicky
okay but I really really like the
formula on it I really like the way that
it makes my lashes look this gives me a
nice volume nice length for it does have
a tiny bit of flaking just a little bit
no smudging on me but a little tiny bit
of flaking just kind of got to keep my
eye out for it just by the end of the
day but I mean overall very happy with
the next ah our lip her lip and cheek
tints I've really just been using them
for cheeks but I've got both of these in
subscription boxes this is the model co
one and then this one is by Elizabeth
Mott and I've really been loving these
and the way that I apply these diddling
I put my foundation on first then I put
these on then I put my power on over top
and then of these things last all
stinking day like I love these
especially the elizabeth smart one you
can get your hands on this one
especially at any kind of discount I
highly recommend this one I do have the
staining ack one I have a couple of my
benefit this one is actually my favorite
followed closely by this one but really
really into these really excited about
these I did just get another cheek tint
in my queue box they just went live not
that long ago so I'm excited to get into
that in the fall cuz it's like a bright
orange red one we'll see but but really
digging on these next up this is a
Vincent Longo powder and this one isn't
gold in Siena which I don't really
understand why it's called golden Sienna
I don't see any golden really in that at
all but this was from my June washable
box and I've just really loved this
press powder a lot I mean it mattifies
my skin it's got a really nice lasting
power doesn't do anything funky I just
lives a really nice finish it is I think
a little bit pricey but I got into my
warrnambool box so i was really happy to
have that so i wanted to mention it to
you and then speaking of
outers this one I did not get in my 10
box this one I actually got for my
friendly she over at least she eternally
who just got married congratulations
girlfriend we did a video together where
she actually came over my house and we
phoned a video together i'll link that
down below but anyway when she came over
she had gone to a Knicks like party
thing I think it was at imats and got a
ton of stuff from NYX and she gave me
some stuff and this was one thing she
gave me that mine is in light medium and
this is the blotting powder and really
really love this honestly I like it just
as much as the vincent longo one and
it's a fraction of the price I do have
normal skin so I'm not sure how it would
hold up an oily skin but on my normal
skin it does a wonderful job I put it
over many different foundations and it
hasn't let me down yet it either has
this one so I'll recommend both of those
okay let's do a fail this is a fail for
me this was the end route dry shampoo by
the bomb and if you all know me you know
how much I love stuff by the bomb a
listen to this that little clicky ball
that little clinic ebo I don't know what
happened here but it broke there's
plenty of products in here but it's
broken no that is not going to work no
when it did work it worked okay it's got
a very alcoholic kind of smell to it it
worked fine this is definitely not even
close to anywhere near as good as the
Battiste you know which is the one that
I like the best especially the brunette
want even if it did work I wouldn't
recommend it and the fact that it's
broken makes me definitely not recommend
it so stay far away from this if you're
shopping for the ballroom especially on
her look it should be coming up again on
hautelook in September or October's to
keep your eye out you want stuff from
the bomb the two-faced cocoa powder
foundation I've really also been loving
now this is kind of a step more than the
powders this mattifies my skin but also
gives a little bit of coverage so
whatever foundation I'm wearing this
will kind of beef it up a little bit i
did just do a review just on this
product so if you want more information
on this i will link that down below but
i really am enjoying this a lot and it
smells like chocolate is it so out of
this world that it's completely worth
the price point is it a must-have know
ah but it's a really fun product and
I've been loving it so I wanted to
mention it on okay just one I've got to
show you this one is a huge
when this is actually the trip Trish
Mick envoy on boy eboy Mickey boy make a
boy McCoy McCoy I don't know I'm not
fancy like that my friend Lilly who I
met here on YouTube she only has one
YouTube video up right now but I'm
trying to encourage her to make more she
sent this to me along with a ton of
wonderful high-end goodies but this was
my favorite thing that she sent to me
and this is the eye base now this
reminds me a lot of the Mac Paint Pots
as far as the application you see how
it's like a it's like a matte um like a
flesh tone and I don't want to say this
is not everybody's flesh is this color
but it's like a matte I don't know what
you call it it's a peachy skin tone
white people skin tone color it's
beautiful she's a little bit deeper of a
skintone to me but she really likes this
one as well I really like this because
it does not crease and it kind of mutes
out any discoloration in my lids which I
really really like and I just love the
way my shadows go on over top of it it's
just beautiful I actually like it better
than my Mac Paint Pot in painterly and
it's amazing and I've never tried
anything from this line so I was really
really excited to try this she gave me
two of these she was so nice to send
that but this was my favorite thing that
she sent me so thank you lily my next up
is something I told you I would update
you on and that is the Elvita brush on
universe like a nail treatment I got it
in a mimi box and it's got these little
lavender pieces floating in it and I do
feel like it has strengthened my nails
so my nails were very very damaged when
I started using it what i did was i
would take my polish off i would put
this on overnight and then do my nails
again in the morning and I do feel like
its strength in my nails is it a
must-have probably not but I do really
like i enjoy using it it's a fun so if
you follow me on instagram you know what
this next product is this here this is
the Stila eyes are the window to the
spirit palette now on Instagram I want
those facebook too I showed you all the
original 1i got of this and I'll insert
a picture here I got it I was so excited
to swatch it and then one of the shadows
was broken and I ass
shuel if you thought it would be
appropriate for me to do a giveaway with
it even though the shot was broken and
everybody's like hair care do we give
away with the hook the only one of them
is broken and I could fix it with some
alcohol definitely do a giveaway so we
are going to be doing a giveaway with
this palette and it's amazing i will
tell you about the giveaway in just a
second but let me just show you how
glorious this palette is you will put
out a few of these I think there's three
of them may be four of them I think
there's three different palettes and
this is kind of like their new how there
was like in the garden and in the light
and all those this is on the eyes are
the window series now these this is kind
of like the greatest hits palette you
have all of Steel as most popular shades
and there is a reason why these are the
most popular there is not a dud in this
bunch I mean they are just stinking
amazing I do want to do a full video on
this but I just don't have time tonight
it is already almost midnight and I
gotta work in the morning so and this is
my last video I'm filming tonight so I
don't have time to film this one now but
i do want to film a full video on this
with a look and swatches and all that
couple this one is kitten which is a
very very famous steal a shade show you
that i mean just stinking gorgeous will
swatch this one here this one i have
absolutely been loving that one is
called Golightly and that's what that
looks like in the finger swatch just
beautiful I mean absolutely gorgeous up
in the crease and one thing I love about
this palette is that so many complete
looks where a lot of pallets are just
missing something like this is this is
such this is the perfect crease color
you know the perfect transition color
for me at least and I feel like this
would work on a lot of skin tones we've
got these colors over here which we're
just going to be beautiful for fall yeah
I'm just absolutely loving loving loving

and you're entered and that's
compliments of ulta because they set me
a new one because of the broken shadow
so I didn't pay for it ulta Tim okay
perfumes so this is the one I've been
loving this summer but i also want to
show you the one that i've been loving
transitioning into fall since that's
what we're doing now and this is just a
dual rollerball of the Viva La Juicy and
the Viva La Juicy left lu v load usually
look dude I don't say that very well
because i love smaller sized perfumes
because i never go through a full size
so i've been really loving the sense of
these it's a perfect mix for me of
fruity and floral I don't like heavily
white floral sense I don't like anything
too fruity either because then I feel
like it's like super young but this one
is definitely fruitier the Viva La Juicy
LeFleur believe it or not to me smells
fruity ER and more summery yeah this one
the La Fleur definitely has more of an
alcohol kind of set but it's definitely
got that fruit on the top and this one's
a little bit warmer the legit be below
juicy is a little bit warmer but they're
both very summery sense really really
enjoy these and they the lasting power
is ok it's pretty good but not fantastic
but pretty typical of a perfume on me
but the one that I've been loving
transitioning is this one by Rihanna and
this is the nude one it's a very nice
light based daytime mostly floral with a
touch of fruit kind of scent and it's
just it's just very light and it just
makes me happy like it's like happiness
in a bottle for me and just really
really enjoying this so if you come
across it I definitely recommend it if
you like those types of sensing another
thing that I have been loving is my
makeup eraser that I reviewed I did get
this for review and I've reviewed it and
I have i will put the link down below to
the review you can see i've been using
this for three weeks ish and you can see
that it is still totally clean I just
throw it in with the rest of my wash
I'll put it in with the fabric softener
and this thing is amazing now this is
the thing though I have heard you guys
about that there are cheaper versions of
this at like dollar tree and at big lots
and stuff and I want to pick one up and
do a comparison what I would love to do
see if you guys would be interested in
this is like you know do my make up
twice so I do it once and I take off
with the makeup eraser on one side and
then the cheap version on the other side
and then do the same thing but then do
like a Neutrogena wipe on one side and
then like a regular wet water wash cloth
on the other side and just compare you
guys are
than that let me know in the comments
below because I've really been loving
this but this is twenty dollars and if
you guys you know can do the same thing
with a you know dollar one from a dollar
store I want to tell you about it so let
me know about that but as of now this is
deadly been something i have been loving
later in the summer okay so a couple
things that I've been loving non makeup
related number one is YouTube music oh
my goodness I have been obsessed with a
couple of different YouTube channels if
you haven't discovered music on YouTube
you are really missing out the way that
I found a lot of people is by searching
for covers Alex G is amazing I mean
these are people that are all really big
I love Andrew Garcia I love chestersee
but my favorite favorite favorite is oh
gosh now I can't even have rid his name
listen my man it's coming it's coming
all right mm-hmm that's Chester's safe
that's Andy line who's my favorite okay
now we're on the edge of copyright
infringement here okay but seriously
Andy Lang is stinking amazing you need
to look him up now especially like
covers I personally love covers we need
to look him up he's amazing and my cats
are fighting another thing that this was
actually sent to me for review and I've
been using a lot and I'm just going to
tell you my opinion on it and it is the
SEO aromatherapy shower kit and the idea
behind this is is that you get this here
and this here attaches to a standard
showerhead little clippie on the back
and this was super easy to do you snap
this little clip on here like that so
this goes on your shower head and then
this hangs down now this adjusts to put
wherever you want so that it sits into
the stream of the water if that makes
sense and then you get these little pods
and each one has a different scent so
you take the pot out there's an
essential oil in here and then you
attach it here so this goes into the
little hole right there and then it
hangs there in your shower like this and
then the essential oils slowly drip out
so that you get this aromatherapy
experience in
shower let me tell you my experience
with it overall it's been very very
positive it was very easy to put into my
shower my only thing is these pods are
sometimes difficult to attach I found
especially this orange one for some
reason was super difficult to attach
I've had a heck of a time I lost almost
like about half the product trying to
attach this orange one but the green one
and the pink one were fine so I don't
know whether it was just mine something
happened in the manufacturing of that
particular one but the scents are really
really good this one breathe is
peppermint eucalyptus clears your
sinuses you greases decreases to
congestion so this one is a little more
invigorating this one has I really smell
like a cinnamon he kind of sentient but
it says it's orange lavender and
patchouli I did not smell the patchouli
i am not a fan of actually and i didn't
smell the patchouli which i'm very
thankful for and this one isn't
uplifting overlay of citrus and spice
and floral tones and it's supposed to be
a stress relief so God used each of
these probably three or four times a
piece at least they're still about half
full so they do last a really long time
and I've been enjoying using this so
this is a win for me i'll put the link
to SEO down below and you can check it
out to see if this is something you'd be
interested in will i purchase more i
probably wouldn't purchase more of them
but if you're more of an aromatherapy
shower person like that's like your
thing you really enjoy that like spa in
your home experience and that's like
something you were like into i would
recommend this for you i personally like
I like it but I don't know if I would
purchase it the last thing I wanted to
share with you that i have been loving
is my new workout routine I'm trying to
like lose some fat like body fat
percentage I'm not saying I'm fat in any
way but I'm trying to lose some body fat
percentage I'm trying to gain some
muscle mass and the best way they said
for me to do that is to actually just
walk on an incline for 45 minutes three
times a week which totally shocked me
because I'm one of those people that
when I go to the gym I like bust my butt
like I will run my face off like and
like sweat and i'll be on the lip t'kul
and i'll be trying to beat my time and
try to do more than i did last time and
what I learned from this personal
trainer is that you don't want to do
that like there's no reason do that if
you're somebody that's
like enjoys walking more and that's what
you should do for me walking on incline
I love to do because then I just set my
little iphone up on the little iphone
holder a plug in my headphones and i
watch youtube videos for 45 minutes
while I walk on an incline and it gets
my heart rate up for 45 minutes and it's
amazing so that's what I've been doing
and then after that I do a little bit of
weights for about 3045 minutes what you
are trying to lower your body fat
percentage something you can do that i
had no idea was just walking on an
incline and what that can do for you
like my body fat percentage has
definitely gone down on and decreased so
I'm really excited about my new workout
routine and hopefully I'm gonna be all
buff soon I want to like be like buff I
want to have like some muscles and I
want to get rid of some of this
happening here you know what I'm saying
ladies I know you all know what I'm
saying did I forget anything oh no you
don't here to tell me you can't even
tell me if I forgot anything like I
forgot something well that's my summer
