see for videos before I went away on my
road trip
the most requested video was Jen what
makeup are you taking on your trip what
are you leaving behind what are you
taking I can't show you what I'm leaving
behind but I am going to show you what
I'm taking its fits in here okay leaving
my babies but you know I I had to make
choices so if you want to know what
those choices were and tight we're
getting into it right now you did not
see my review of these these were
actually sent to me these lu bella bags
it was not a sponsored video but i will
put the link to that video and how it
where to purchase these bags down below
they are from amazon but they're really
really nice i like them a lot it does
come with a bunch of dividers that
divide this up so you can keep
everything organized but the pallets
that I'm bringing didn't fit unless I
took all of the dividers out so that's
what I chose to do so everything's just
kind of in here in a mess so I'm just
gonna start taking things out and show
you what I'm bringing so the first thing
I want to show you is these alte dual
tipped cotton applicators you probably
see me use these and my demos before I
love these things
these are for me to sharpen up my like
my line right here of my eyeshadow
fixing mistakes things like that I also
have a little mini my solar water in
here this one's by neo Jing I don't know
I got a sample of it somewhere but just
any my solar water I like this one
because it's a small container and also
it's got a little tiny top so I can just
dip the q-tip in very easily and clean
up any mistakes that I have so that's
gonna be really important face primer
primed and peachy it's gonna be hot most
of the places that we're going so I
wanted a nice light primer I didn't want
anything too heavy with silicone
dimethicone kinds of things so the Too
Faced prime the peachy is great it's got
like a little tiny bit of a cooling
effect which is really nice it seeps
into the skin it doesn't leave my skin
feeling heavy so that's why I chose this
one for a foundation I chose the
peerless BB cream and it does work very
well it's a lighter to medium coverage
so what I did was I also brought my
photo bomb and this is a powder
foundation by the balm and what
do with this if I want to beef up the
coverage of that is I'll just Pat this
on top this also works as more of a
mattifying kind of powder so it's kind
of multitasking there depending on how
thick I want to lay it on I can make it
more like foundation like or I can just
kind of dust it around to give me a
little bit more of like a setting powder
kind of feel to it I am bringing my to
face at peach perfect powder which I
love this just brings joy to my heart
it's good it's got such a nice scent to
it it's so finely milled and it's just a
beautiful way to just finish off my
makeup and just help everything just
finish and lock together and I love this
stuff also I love that the packaging of
it that it's got this top here so when
we're traveling everywhere I don't have
to worry about opening it up and
spilling it everywhere I can know that
I'm gonna have to pull this top open in
order to get the product out which is a
really good thing when you're in a like
small confined place you don't want to
make a huge makeup mess I'm bringing to
eyeshadow primary kinds of things I'm
bringing the covergirl lid lock up I
really really like this anything you see
covergirl in here was sent to me by
covergirl I do have a full review of the
entire spring collection from covergirl
down in the description down below but
the lid lock up is such a great great
great eyeshadow primer it works just as
good as my Urban Decay what I really
like off this is it's got a little bit
of a tackiness to it so I feel like it
hold onto shimmers better than eyeshadow
primer that isn't as tacky so I really
really like this a lot it also works for
matte shades but I feel like it does a
really great job with metallic and
shimmer shades I'm also bringing my Mac
Paint Pot in painterly to mute out
discoloration which I do feel like I
want to use sometimes I want to like
kind of get rid of that discoloration so
yeah so I brought this too for brows I'm
bringing a few brow products I've got my
covergirl pencil I could have picked any
of my pencils they all pretty much do
the same thing this is the one in soft
brown it's number 710 but I really
really like this it's got the spoolie on
the back makes me super happy it works
great and that's for if I want like a
little bit darker of a brown oh and then
I brought the brow gal instant brown
hair brow stuff that I got in a boxy
charm I really really like this product
a lot so it adds color and also a little
bit of filling in as well
it's got this little teeny tiny brush
that I love for detailing and I just
really like this product I was so
surprised that I really off like looked
at it I was like you know what I'm
bringing that and if I want something a
little bit lighter for brows I brought
this trusty Quan and I really like this
one too this one's just a little bit
lighter though it's got the brown crayon
II pencil II thing on one side that's
angled and then on the other side it's
got a tinted brow gel and that's what
I'm wearing on my brows today and I just
really like this one a lot it's it
leaves my brows set like I can feel that
they're in place when my brows don't
feel crunchy and I love that same thing
with the one from the brow gal I feel
like it doesn't leave my brows crunchy
but holds my brows in place so all
really good stuff for eyeliner I'm
bringing two I'm bringing this liquid
eyeliner again by covergirl I just
really like this I can't help it this is
number 320 and it's just a black I love
this because it's got this really really
fine point and it just goes on
beautifully it lasts really really well
and I really love this a lot and don't
get mad at me for including this because
it's a good product I can't help it
this is the Kat Von D tattoo liner in
trooper I had just purchased this before
all the stuff went down with her and
it's just a fantastic liquid eyeliner
and I love it it lasts all day it's very
easy to use so I'm bringing that to so
I've got my house of lashes lash glue
which is like a magnet it's like like
makes my eyelashes my fake eyelashes
just stick on really really well so I'm
bringing that I'm definitely gonna have
to re-up on this when I get home though
because I'm starting to run out a little
bit and I have a feeling while I'm gone
it's gonna get a little low I'm also
bringing my lash container this is my
random lash container and the reason why
I'm bringing this instead of brand new
lashes because all of these are already
trimmed so they're just they'd this is
what I do they just all sit in there
randomly there are these little spaces
that you could put them on and make it
look all pretty not they don't stay
there so I just throw them all in there
and what I'll usually do is all kind of
when I take them off I'll pick some of
the lash glue off and then I'll just
kind of smash the two lashes together so
that they stay together like this this
is two lashes stuck together and then I
throw them in here but these are all pre
trimmed so they're all ready to go when
I need to use them mascara I'm bringing
my essence lash princess Volume Mascara
do I need to say
love these mascara it's volume length
amazingness and it's fabulous and I love
it I'm bringing it let me show you the
one just in case you've never seen it
super super mascara and much less
expensive than a lot of comparable
mascaras as far as the performance of it
love this stuff all the Pala D stuff is
at the bottom so we'll do that last for
lips what I decided was this was this
was hard for me because I really had so
many lip products that I absolutely love
but what I decided to do was just bring
these bad habit liquid lipsticks because
I rewatched my live stream that I did
trying these on and there's such a nice
variation of colors in this set they're
pretty much brand new I think that came
out like a week or two ago and you know
there's a deep red there's a more bright
red there's a peachy color there's like
a cool brown there's a warm Brown and I
just really like these I feel like I've
kind of got everything that I could want
just with this so why struggle what I'm
trying to find other things when these
will pretty much do what I want them to
do they aren't the most comfortable
liquid lipstick in the world because
they are really transfer resistant
they're not transfer proof but they're
very transfer resistant so they are a
little bit dry on the lips but not super
uncomfortable if I do feel like they're
a little uncomfortable I'm gonna go
ahead and throw a gloss on and I brought
two glosses one is the Natasha de Nona
this is just a plain gloss that my
friend Nancy gave me and it's just the
plain gloss to put over top and then I'm
bringing the covergirl sparkly bits wan
this is the double platinum melting pout
glitz just for a little bit of extra
sparkle if I'm feeling in the mood and I
like this one because like with for
example the milk makeup holographic lip
gloss
if you must your lips together the
holographic effect is gone but with this
because it does have those fine micro
glitters in it the glitters do stay in
the lipstick like you can still see them
even if you motion lips together which I
personally really really like so I'm
bringing that too oh there's one more
bad habit one this is the peach one
I didn't say concealers I missed that
when we were talking about bases so I'm
bringing two concealers this one is the
color pop no filter concealer in the
shade light 14 this one is closer to
matching my skin tone where this one
here by makeup revolution this is C 6.5
this
one is lighter than my skin tone so
brightening concealing we got both we
got both now on to palate e-business I
brought for blush I'm not a big blush
person as far as needing a big variation
of blushes in my life but the girls
getaway trio I'm bringing this because
there's one that's you know the more
Brown and you've got one that's a little
more peach one that's a little more pink
these this is definitely really good for
someone with my skin tone probably won't
work as well for someone that is deeper
than me but it works great for me it's
great for travel because I get all three
on this little thing together and it's
perfect three more things for contouring
i'm bringing my play play by tarte this
is the original one that they got rid of
for some unknown reason i love this this
also gives me the neutral eyeshadows
that i need in order to make me happy
and create not neutral but more natural
shades in order to create a very simple
I look and I've got my contour shades
there and I just really love this
lasting power is fantastic it smells
like vanilla it makes me very happy to
add to my natural vault of eyeshadows
I'm also bringing my Too Faced natural
love palette because I've got you know
some pinks and stuff if I want to make
it a little bit more fun I can add a
couple of pops of color if I want to and
I really do love this palette I looked
everywhere for my chocolate gold palette
and I have officially misplaced it what
I do is a lot of times I'll make a bag
of stuff that I need for a video and
I'll put everything in a bag and I'll
film the video and then I'll forget to
put the things away I have a feeling
that it's in a bag somewhere and I tore
apart my room trying to find it I can't
find it so unfortunately I'm not gonna
be able to bring the truck with gold I'm
bringing this instead and to replace the
shimmers I'm bringing the magic palette
by Julius place this one is going to
give me any kind of metallic shimmer
that I could possibly want all my
favorite colors in here these two here
let me just show you these two these two
are insane
watch this watch this watch this oh my
gosh for reals though oh my gosh okay
and then loui wait okay let's just do
that let's do the gold and let's do this
light blue oh my gosh girlfriend or
boyfriend tell me you're not dying right
now
I can't even it's amazing it's so good
these metallic shades are incredible so
this I feel like is going to give me all
of the bright colors that I might want
to use together yes and then finally for
highlight I'm bringing my tart skin
twinkle volume 2 which is kind of a
random palette
I love these highlighters I really do I
love that there's four of them in here
so I don't have to worry about bringing
multiple palettes and I can use this one
kind of for a little bit more of a
bronzey look and then these are
beautiful for more of a lighter look
these two are my favorites oh my gosh I
love them so much let me see if I can
give you a little swatches of those
because they are just they make me so
happy they're very from space kinds of
highlighters they're really really
pretty so that is it for all of the
makeup that I'm bringing on my trip I am
going to be bringing some of my drunk
elephant skincare I do have a video on
that coming up very very soon that is on
the list of things that I already filmed
so you will be seeing that for haircare
I'm bringing a lot of mark-anthony stuff
they send me a lot of PR and I really
like their stuff so I'm going to be
bringing a lot of their stuff for
brushes I'm gonna be bringing mostly
probably Moda brushes and Luxy brushes
because those are my favorites and this
is everything packed inside I didn't
overfill it on purpose because I don't
want to have to struggle to fit
everything back in so I'm excited that
it all fits very easily in my container
so I want to thank you so much for
