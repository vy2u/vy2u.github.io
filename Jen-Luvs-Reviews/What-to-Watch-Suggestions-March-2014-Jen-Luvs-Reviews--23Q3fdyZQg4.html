idea of just to show you guys what comes
up in my what to watch when i login on
youtube i don't know i just thought it
would be interesting you guys might be
interested in seeing what i'm watching
and what YouTube thinks I should be
watching so the first subscription that
pops up is the Franco holic and I'm
mildly obsessed with his videos he
doesn't upload that often but every time
he I see a new video from him I get
super excited I he's kind of scrubbing
it in this video he usually looks a
little more put together than that but
he is the best perfumer reviewer I have
ever seen in my life if you want to see
how perfume reviews should be done watch
the frag aholic I have learned so much
about sense and about perfume vocabulary
and the way that they all work and go
together and and oh my gosh I've learned
so much about perfume from him so highly
recommending the fray aholic channel
just really fun the next one down here
is Mortimer and she is a recent
subscription of mine I just found her
she just finished up in February a
subscription box month where she wrote
to all of the different subscription
boxes and saw who would send her a box
review so if you're interested in
subscription box openings definitely
check out her februari videos I mean
she's just she's got a really fun just
sweet personality and I'm really
enjoying her videos now this one right
here at Disney collects my son is
obsessed with her channel basically all
she does is she buys toys and she
reviews them and my son is totally and
completely obsessed if she if it's a
play-doh thing she demonstrates how to
make all of the play-doh she
demonstrates how the toys work and it's
just ridiculous her popularity Toria
done LOL I I went on like a little
Victoria Dinello catching up video spree
like a week ago I just discovered her
channel she's just starting to get more
subscribers and views and I I don't know
she's just really funny and if you all
like honest channels people that that
really truly tell you what they think
you'll love Victoria's channel she's
very detailed her in her reviews and I
really enjoy her channel the next one is
Lucky Penny shop which is another one
that's similar to disney collector that
my son is obsessed with but he
he also buys like candy and food things
from other countries and all kinds of
really interesting things one thing my
son loves is he reviews like old-school
toys like McDonald's maker things where
like you can make McDonald's milkshakes
and things and it's just really
interesting to watch my son really is
completely obsessed with his videos as
well next up is the YouTube help I'm
always keeping up on the YouTube help
channel just to see what I you know make
sure I know everything I'm supposed to
know as far as running my youtube
channel should i watch that a lot
whatthebuckshow he is a news show I
don't this is not a typical video from
him how I met my husband his videos are
usually news related pop culture related
and I have been I don't know I don't not
positive whether he knows who I am or
not but I've been subscribed to him
since he had like 20-some thousand
subscribers and now he's like huge like
mega mega mega channel but I have a lil
T to him since I've been subscribed to
him for 84 years probably six years I've
been subscribed to him Melissa Raymond
you all should know her I would imagine
motion few all know her and melissa is
amazing she's hilarious she's got a
great personality and she is very
knowledgeable about makeup it's a very
funny picture of her that does not do
her beauty justice if you've seen her
channel you know she's gorgeous and
that's just a goofy picture of her but
she's great I really enjoy her channel
now these are the channels that I'm not
subscribed to that they're recommending
for me now I don't know hardly any of
these I don't know her this is actual
actually metaphysical stuff every once
in a while I watch videos about
metaphysical things like crystals like
how to use like stones for healing and
like all kinds of really interesting
things I don't know if I believe in it
but I just think it's really interesting
so this is how to use a pendulum I don't
I don't know so I don't know I just
watched that every once in a while I
don't know this channel this is the
birchbox channeling we know they had a
channel so i might check that out Tara
