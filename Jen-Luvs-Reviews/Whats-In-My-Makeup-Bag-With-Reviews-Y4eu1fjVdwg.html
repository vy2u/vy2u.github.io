everybody's doing well miss you too miss
YouTube videos but things crazy I have a
baby you want to see him he's eating a
piece of broccoli that's how I'm keeping
him quiet
I see hey hi baby John hi I have
recently become obsessed with makeup and
I've watched a lot of makeup videos on
YouTube
my first obsession for makeup videos was
makeup geek long long long long time ago
I found out recently that there are a
gazillion people talking about makeup on
YouTube and I thought I would join the
ranks and record a video of the makeup
that I use in case anybody cares or is
interested or might want to buy some
stuff and aren't sure whether it's good
or not I'll tell you what I got and what
I use and what I like so here's some of
my go-to stuff I have this Sephora
artist lipstick palette that I got a
while back I'm gonna use like two colors
of it yep I use that one and that one up
there because most of them look terrible
on me I don't see romantic I use that
one a lot and then I used reaming plum
woo dreaming I wonder what plums dream
about I'm gonna know um this another
thing that I use a lot that I love this
is actually my favorite eyeshadow Kat
Von D's believe it or not I didn't think
that I would like it as much as I do but
I do the black is completely gone I
broke it I was using it for eyeliner and
I broke it but it would be gone even if
I didn't break it but I'd probably use
this eyeshadow more than any other
eyeshadow I love it because it's very
very pigmented it blends really nicely
and it's probably the best eyeshadow
palette I have ever bought Ludwig oh it
says a smoky eye adds an instant air of
mystery I don't know about that but I
don't know if there's I'm very
mysterious but I'm not marry me source
is this book of mystery do I look
mysterious to you
all right next up I have my Z palette
that I got this is all makeup geek
eyeshadow hi I'm getting bored with your
broccoli and I just picked out colors
that I didn't already have and I'll put
in the description exactly what colors
these are makeup geek eyeshadows are
pretty good I like them overall there
they're definitely pigmented but they
don't blend as nicely as I thought they
would maybe it's operator error maybe
I'm just not that good at blending but
they don't blend as nicely as they Kat
Von D eyeshadows they're definitely
highly pigmented though you have to be
really careful with them we're all still
it'll go crazy I'm actually wearing o
makeup geek eyeshadow right now and I do
like it I do definitely like it I would
buy more of it but it isn't my absolute
100% favorite okay next up inside I have
my NYX jumbo eye pencil I forgot to
focus a little focus on it my NYX jumbo
eye pencil on milk this is good if
you're going to wear bright colors it
kind of brightens the color as you put
it on and then you smooth it and it's
super cheap I think it was like 3 or 4
bucks
it also minimizes fall out like the
little flake ease that sometimes you get
from cheaper eyeshadow or glitter
eyeshadow sometimes it falls on your
face so this kind of helps it to kind of
stick to your eye this I love Laura
Mercier I think I'm saying it right I
hope I'm saying it right in amethyst
this is the caviar stick eye color and I
absolutely love this let me show you
this let me show you how awesome stuff
is look how creamy and awesome that is
and watch it blend all my stuff and
watch this stuff look how beautiful that
is how beautiful that blends
unfortunately they only make a couple
colors of that I wish that they made
more because I would buy more if they
made more because it's awesome you just
have to be careful like I don't like it
all over my eye at just too dark it
makes my eyes look sunken in but it's
really nice for like over here on this
to kind of do that shading on the side
that's really popular right now for
foundation I just use I use GP
Foundation I've never noticed the
difference between expensive foundation
and Chafee foundation I also have no
problem with covergirl face powder never
had a problem with it I like the way it
looks it makes me happy okay right now
I've never found a really good mascara
that I like right now I'm using this
volumous and voluminous million lashes
by somebody cheap from the grocery store
I can't tell I'm getting too old the
print is too small and I'm too old maybe
I'll be able to see it later I'll put a
long note it works fine it's not
fantastic but it doesn't clump and it's
fine now I swear to buy this this is
crazy this I use just for my eyebrows I
have this weird let me show you this
weird little space right here and my
eyebrows I'll show you like right there
and I have to color it in so that it you
don't see a weird space so I use great
lash yeah it works fine that stuff it
used to really suck I used to hate that
it used to really dry out really fast it
was just it was just not good quality
but they've really improved it I'm happy
with it so I use it and also if I'm
desperate I have fresh complexion
concealer I don't get a lot of blemishes
everyone smile I've dark circles on my
eyes but not too much I don't really
like this much it doesn't blend very
nicely but in a pinch it works okay one
of my favorite things and you can see
this has had a lot of love this is my
Urban Decay primer potion I highly
recommend that it really makes my
eyeshadow stay on longer
this was actually Victoria's Secret
blush and I actually like it it's really
old it's probably a couple years old
blush trio it's called afterglow I like
their sunny cheeks too but I ran out of
that a long time ago so I don't have any
of that right now it's summertime and
I'll probably get another one or I'll
get something different I'm not sure yet
but I just discovered this blush by
Tarte it goes on really easily it's very
very pigmented but it's not so pigmented
that you end up pushing up your face and
making your face look like a clown
another thing face wise that I just
discovered that actually my husband
bought it for me for Christmas was this
Laura Mercier
illuminator I never used an illuminator
before and it is awesome especially for
nighttime it gives you like a little
shimmer without being gaudy and it
doesn't make me look like I'm trying to
be 12 or 17 or 21 or whatever how over
old you are when you were lots of
glitter so anyway yeah this stuff is
awesome let me show you kind of what it
looks like it's like shimmery you just
put a very lightly on your cheeks it's
almost like gives the effect of like I
got sunkissed dewy kind of feeling it
feels good on my skin like it's real
soft it just makes me feel like I'm
going out you know at night without
being obnoxious and glittery
I know it looks really glittery right
there at least on my finger it looks
kind of glittery in my view but but it
does look really really nice on okay the
next one is actually something I would
not recommend buying it's the Sephora
eye shadow I was not happy with this at
all
it has a lot of fallout if the color
payoff is not agree I keep it because it
I don't have any of these colors
anywhere else so I dig into it to try to
get those colors but I'm very
disappointing this eye shadow I would
not recommend buying it okay one thing I
just discovered were these with the
Bobbi Brown liquid eyeliners I think no
gel eyeliners long-wear gel eyeliners
these things are awesome I have black
ink and then I have I had to sigh
between purple and blue I end up getting
blue cobalt ink but I wish I got in the
purple because purple was beautiful I'm
going to go back and get the purple but
they're so obnoxiously expensive that I
hate spending more money on them but
they really are amazing they stay on
forever and ever and ever I also have a
couple of Laura Laura Mercier eyeshadows
they're good I like them they're above
average there are on the line with the
makeup geek ones they're good my
favorites but they're good
okay this I've had forever I don't know
if they still make it but this is the
but this is also incredibly good cream
eyeliner it was toasted brown and pink
play it was a gel eyeliner duo by
Victoria's Secret but especially the
brown was awesome
the pink actually kind of used for like
a cream eyeshadow instead it kind of
sucked as a eyeliner but it was nice as
an eyeshadow so I've used that a lot
this is the only thing I have by
Clinique and the other reason why I
bought it is because it was the only
author about that it was the only eye
shadow I can fine sorry for my baby
making so much noise this the only way I
can make a video cuz he doesn't ever
sleep ever right do you ever sleep baby
nope
I never sleep never ever ever ever ever
sleep but yeah see this nice natural
colors like this one right here is so
nice for by the brow bone for a
highlighter oh my gosh I love it
these colors are wonderful so that's the
only and I like these eyeshadows I don't
know why I don't buy more clinic
eyeshadows but yeah I really like them a
lot I throw away the brush because the
brushes always are terrible and totally
neutral so I wanted to do one more piece
of this I just went to the gym and I
wanted to show you I didn't wash my
makeup off before I went to the gym and
that's what still looks like look at my
eyeliner let me see when I say while I'm
making a video
look my eyeliner still there and look
check this out
remember the swatch I put on my hand of
that Laura Mercier creamy the sticky
thingy
look I just washed my hands and it's
still there
I worked out I did a bunch of stuff and
I wash my hands and it's still there so
there you go that high didn't she get
big she's so big all right my love see
you soon bye say bye hey my daddy that's
not daddy it's safe at my people my
people say mad love now yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
