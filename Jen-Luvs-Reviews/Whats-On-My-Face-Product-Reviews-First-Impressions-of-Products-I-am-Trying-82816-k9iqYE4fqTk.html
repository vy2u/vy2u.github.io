in my room filming what's up the makeup
hello my friends welcome to what's on my
face where I tell you everything that's
on my face in this week's episode of
what's up my makeup one time per month
which is the last Sunday of the month
this show shows up on the channel and
that's what you're seeing right now all
other weeks it shows up at what's up of
makeup calm so if you're ever curious
about what's in my face you can always
head over to what's up in makeup calm
every week and see what is on my face so
today I'm testing out a lot of new
products and I decided to use mostly
drugstore priced products this week
because i'm working on an altar brand
review so i've got a lot of ulta
products and I've got some other
products to that i want to show you so
let's go ahead and start off with where
i started which is face primer the face
primer i used today i got with my Ipsy
points it is the ambient light
correcting primer in luminous light by
hourglass i am in the middle of testing
this um so far I don't even really see a
lot of luminosity I don't see anything
magical happening with this but I want
to do like serious where test business
to see whether this helps my makeup last
longer i got it in three shades i don't
see much difference between the shades
i'm a little confused by this product at
this point but again i'm still in the
middle of testing so we will see what
happens with this I'm not sure what's
going to happen but we will find out
that was not a drugstore product but the
next one is I just reviewed this in my
monthly favorites for August this is the
altered Emmy matte foundation I'm
wearing it again today I love this stuff
it makes me so happy it feels good on
the skin has a really nice lasting power
blends out just beautifully and is only
12 50 so definite recommend on this you
haven't seen my August favorites they
will be linked down below for eye primer
i'm using the eye primer by ulta it is
the nude matt fragrance free oil free
paraben free eye primer i use this today
before i got ready because i got ready
and then i took off my makeup and i got
ready again
and I used this on one eye and my
favorite eyeshadow primer which is the
Urban Decay eyeshadow primer and Eden I
use that on the other eye and just as of
today I did not see much of a difference
between the two products they seemed
pretty much the same but i only tested
it one day so i'm gonna have to keep
testing this to see whether it can
really hold up to my Urban Decay's for
concealer today I use the glamour
flashlight by hard candy I've had this
for a minute I really like this product
blends very nicely with the fingers you
don't even really need a brush with it
it just blends out really nice it's it's
a thicker coverage for a stick found
concealer it's a thicker kind of
consistency but it blends out really
nicely not cakey not so thick that it's
hard to work with and it's really nice
I've had this for a while my friend
Victoria over Victoria Nelda had sent
this to me for a swap a long time ago
and I'm still using it and still loving
it she did great on her swap there's a
couple of products i still use that she
sent me this is one of them this is a
great product if you've ever run into
this by hard candy for browse today
another product that i used from my
favorites from august dekhe brow by
benefit absolutely loving this love the
little brush in the top love the the
dipbrow kind of formula they've got
going on here one thing I noticed is
this is a really small product compared
to the dipbrow so that was something I
didn't mention to my review I I put them
next to each other and I was like oh my
gosh look at the difference between the
sides own let me show you real quick
look at the difference in the size now
the pot for the anastacio is shallower
but it's not that much more shallow than
the benefit like crazy right but I do
like the formula this one better because
it's not quite as opaque I don't like my
brows to be super opaque so this one
really makes me happy I really really
like it a lot it's a great formula I do
like the dipbrow as well it just takes a
little bit more work to spoil you
through together to be a little more
natural eye shadow today I use this
little palette that i got in an Ulta
like freebie bag it's like one of those
where you get like free gift with
purchase you get a bag full of alta
makeup it doesn't even have a name
unless made in china isn't
name it's just a palette I tried working
with this initial thoughts are that it's
a really good day time look palette the
shades just aren't super punchy for
filming purposes so I did have to punch
it up a little bit I use these two
shades on my lid this is my crease this
on the lower lash line and this one in
the outer corner and this one and the
inner highlight inner corner highlight
they blend very nicely they go on very
nicely it's just not enough for me for
filming but if you just look you're not
filming which most of people watching
this probably aren't you probably aren't
looking for a filming palette so you may
actually really like the old eyeshadows
the quality reminds me a lot of the
missjenfabulous palette that I reviewed
from Ulta brand goes on really really
easily it's just not punchy I definitely
still need to play with this this is
only the second time I've used it
topping it off I used space cowboy by
urban decay it's just really just
glitter it looks like it's got a
pigmentation to it but it really isn't
there really isn't a whole lot of
pigmentation it's mostly just silver
glitter with a tiny bit of a
cream-colored base but you can't really
even see the base so I had to add that
on to give my eyes just a little bit
more pop stuff has crazy fallout but I
only plan on wearing this look for a few
hours so I wasn't really worried about
it I really just want to get a nice look
for filming so i did use this but i
definitely don't recommend this product
it's pretty bad as far as the fall out
and just being not a super usable
product but it works for today and
that's all i needed to do eyeliner today
I'm using the brand new to face sketch
marker that I got in my Nicki tutorials
kit that I will be hopefully filming
this week for you the review for that
I'm done testing it for review i do want
to play with a little more but I've
pretty much formed my solid opinion on
the palate and the kid as a whole just a
little mini review of this I really like
this eyeliner i do want to wear it a
couple more times just to make sure I'm
solid on it before I film and I did want
to wear it tonight just to kind of play
with it see if I can rub my wing off at
the end of the night things like that
but so far really liking it very easy to
use very very very black very enjoyable
product to use is so cute the little pen
little thing i feel like i need a little
pocket protector to go with
it it's just so cute so cute I think
jared is just a genius when it comes to
packaging and this is just stinkin
adorable and it's really fun to use and
very easy to use so definitely big
thumbs up on this I would love to get
more colors I just wish they weren't so
expensive for blush i use the ultima
neural blush this is in the shade tulip
this is a very very very very light
shade very light shade and it barely
shows up on my skin tone just barely but
it is very nice for a very subtle flush
of color and I do like the shade on me
but I did want a more subtle look on my
cheeks and this definitely gave that to
me I haven't tested this enough to talk
about where time of it but the initial
application was very very nice just you
know it's really light shades to take
that in consideration with your skin
tone and whether you think this would
work for you contour and highlight our
courtesy of makeup revolution courtesy
meaning that i use this palette not that
they paid me for this video or that they
bought this palette for me i bought it
it is the Ulta ultra contour palette all
this old stuff this is the ultra contour
palette I use this shade here for my
contour and I use this shade from I
highly very subtle highlight may be nice
for people with textured skin I would
imagine I don't have a very textured
skin but it is a more subtle highlight I
really like this contour shade a lot
feel like it came out very nice i'm very
happy with it the way that it came out
it's got a banana yellow a kind of shade
here that's really nice for under the
under eyes or if you need more of a
salmon ii pinky kind of color under your
under eyes that's a nice color there and
it's got a nice range of shades here
i've also used this highlight this one's
a little bit more of a pop and highlight
but overall just a really nice palette i
really like it a lot i enjoy using it i
haven't played with it enough to again
just talk about lasting power that's why
i haven't fully reviewed this yet i'm
still playing with it but you know
application wise it's very nice I just I
don't have a solid opinion as far as
lasting power on this so I'm not going
to speak to that lips today I did a
little bit of a crazy combo I started
off with this ultimate lip cream in the
shade bombshell put that all over my
lips it was a little bit deeper than
what I really wanted to go for so I
added a little bit of this one on top
this one is in the shade besties
that lighten it up and then it looked a
little boring to me so I had it on top
of there this ulta mineral lip gloss in
the shade opal sheer this stuff is
insane I have to show this you I just
have to I can't have to show it to you
it's crazy it's got a brush wand and it
is metallic metallic I want to wear this
just by itself sometime just for the fun
of it it is a fun metallic shade scent
is pretty terrible it smells like
plastic but really fun really fun kind
of goopy but fun so I pop that in the
center of my lips just to give it a
little bit of shine just to make it a
little more fun but again i just started
trying these products so i have no no
full verdict on these lip products yet
but that's what I'm testing out right
now and that's what I have on my face so
