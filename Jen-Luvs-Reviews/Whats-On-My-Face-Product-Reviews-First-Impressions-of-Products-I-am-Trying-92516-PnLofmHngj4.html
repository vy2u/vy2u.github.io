face where I tell you everything that's
on my face and in this case the things I
used to put things on my face in this
week's episode of what's up and make up
typically this video is housed on what's
it been makeup.com but once a month it
does come to the channel to last time
you the month because we typically have
a weekly live chat at this time but to
kind of replace that we throw this in
there to give you something to do until
5pm easter time when we have our actual
chat today and that'll be on youtube if
you want to join the chat you should
need to come to the channel at about 5
p.m. eastern time and you should be able
to find the video I should also be
linking the video underneath this week's
episode of what's up and make up if you
want to join the chat around 4 30ish so
without further ado let's talk about
what's on my face we're going to start
where I started which is a face primer
that I collie face primer but other
people call it something different this
is the josie maran argan deadly moisture
protecting perfect I use this in my holy
grail video was the rider die tag by
jaclyn hill i did use this as my primer
a lot of people were saying it's not a
face primer but Josie Maran herself says
it can be used as a face primers are
therefore I call it a face primer it is
technically a tinted moisturizer but I
love it as a face primark gives just a
tiny bit of coverage like this much it
just gives a really nice base for
foundation so I really like it a lot and
for foundation today I used my ELF
moisturizing foundation stick oh my gosh
is the stuff amazing absolutely amazing
people in the community have told me
that it is not technically sold out and
they were putting they put on super sale
on the elf website and but supposedly
you can still get this at Ulta calm and
some other places so if you can find
this I definitely recommend jumping on
it is stinking amazing oh my goodness it
is in the shade natural is the shade
that I use today I kind of use the
cheater pants method to apply it I used
my new artiste brush this is the artiste
oval
7 this is the first time I've ever used
this brush and oh my goodness like I can
see what the hype is all about so now
that I could see what the hype is all
about with artiste brushes now I need to
find a dupe for it because these things
are stupid expensive but I can see what
people really like them because it
blended my foundation like a dream oh my
gosh i was on periscope getting ready
and it was like oh like the Angels sang
when I use this so yeah going to be
looking for a dupe now because this is a
crazy price for what it is but it works
it works for powder today I used my
original mineral veil by bare minerals I
really like this as a face powder it's
extremely finely milled I love the way
it sits on my skin because it doesn't
actually doesn't feel like it sits on
the skin it seems like it just kind of
blends into the foundation that i'm
using gives me a really nice finish love
this one this is the holiday packaging
you probably won't be able to find this
one anymore but the contents are exactly
the same as a typical bare minerals
mineral veil definite recommend there oh
I forgot to tell you for concealer today
I used my brand new tart shape tape and
I did use this brush to blend it out so
far really really enjoying it this is
the first time I've ever used it
actually in like triangle it test it and
so I can't really talk about how it
wears or anything like that but the
application of it was very nice I do
really like it I have the shade light
it's a little bit light for my skin tone
but I think it's going to be alright but
definitely jury's still out on this one
have not tried enough the first
impressions are very positive going into
eyeshadow i did a base of the NYX jumbo
pencil in milk because i knew i wanted
my shadows to pop today I knew what I
was going to use and almost like I want
to make sure the color really shows up
today so I started off with this space
it's a great way to start off I shadow
really really like it i forgot under
that i use my Urban Decay primer potion
but I don't know how much that really
makes a difference with milk I don't
know if you really need them both but i
did use them both today for eyeshadow
today i used my brand new jus vyas place
masquerade palette I am excited to try
this more this is the first time I've
ever used it these pans are in
same Lee huge I used this shade up in
the crease and I've got a butcher the
name but this shade in the crease I use
this shade all over my lid and then I
use this shade too deep it up the crease
on my lower lash line is the shade right
here just to add a little pop of color
and I very much enjoyed using them today
but I really don't feel like I can give
a real true review of this from today
because i did use these little artiste
brushes this one is the one in oval
three and then this one is in elite
linear one it was very strange to use
these there's definitely a learning
curve on these as far as knowing how to
use them I was almost rubbing this on my
eyes like a toothbrush it was very odd
but it blended things out really really
nicely so I'm curious to play with this
more this one I use like right in the
crease with that deeper brown shade just
to really target and it was super easy
to get that shade in there and evenly to
target this one can be used for a liner
but I use it just to kind of draw that
deeper line in my crease and it worked
really really well but against first
time I've ever used it so I can't really
review it completely but first
impression was pretty fun it was fun to
use same thing with a dubious place
palette again first time I've ever used
it but this is have a look came out and
I'm really happy with it so can't
complain so far for brows today I used
the loreal brow stylist definer this is
an amazing iPad eyebrow pencil if you
are looking for a brow pencil highly
recommend this one this one the dark one
is really really dark though so if you
don't have super dark hair like like
this hair you probably don't want the
one that's a little bit later this one
is in dark brunette and you definitely
it's for like dark dark brown to black
hair it's very very nice for that but
it's a really nice pencil goes on really
smooth the spoolie is great it just
lasts all day it's it's it sinks right
down to the skin blends really nicely
into the brows just a fantastic product
for eyeliner today I used a product I
think I got this in a subscription box
or I got it with FC points i can't
remember this is the aurora intensively
precise eyeliner and waterproof it is a
marker tip so it's a little bit
difficult to work with but it's very
black which i really really
but the marker tip is a little bit fixed
so if you don't like thicker eyeliner
you may not like this one but it does
last a really long time the wings will
rub off if I do do wings during the day
but it lasts on my lash line really well
definitely not my favorite eyeliner of
all the time but it is a nice one I've
never heard of this brand Aurora so I'm
curious to try more products from this
brand moving on to lashes i got these a
generation beauty these are the our dell
studio affects their the 110s that's
what I'm wearing for lashes today and I
really really like them a lot i'm a huge
ardell lash fan huge huge huge and then
duo lash glue is the glue that I used
for cheeks today I used my blush and
bronzer palette by Coastal Scents this
is brand-new they did send this to me
for review I haven't tried it enough to
review it yet but i did use this shade
on my cheeks today that's the blush that
i'm wearing very very pigmented careful
not to go to clown face but so far so
far so good but i definitely haven't
done enough with it in order to review
it these are all things that i'm just
starting to try coming back from
generation beauties so these were all
reviews that are going to be coming up
this is the Urban Decay illuminated trio
this is a brand new set for the holidays
this is again something I haven't hardly
used yet I use this middle shade here it
is straight glitter strake litter if you
do not want glitter on your cheeks you
will not like this palette if you go out
to clubs or if you just like glitter on
your face this is going to be something
that you might want to look at but if
you don't like litter definitely pass on
this one I have a highlighter review
video coming up soon as soon as I have
enough time to test I have three holiday
highlighters I'm in review and this is
one of them but I definitely need to
test it more and then for contouring
she's my elf contour palette I just used
the shade here old reliable it's amazing
so that's it for what's up my face today
I hope you enjoy learning about what is
on my face and hopefully you found some
