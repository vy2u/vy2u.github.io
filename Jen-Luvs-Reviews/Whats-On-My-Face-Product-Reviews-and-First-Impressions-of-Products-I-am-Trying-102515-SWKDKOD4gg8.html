face when I tell you everything that I
put on my face for this week's episode
of what's up in makeup welcome to the
whites of a makeup website I appreciate
you being here and make sure you check
out all the cool features and buttons
and all kinds of cool stuff we have on
the website here before you leave the
calendar the forum and lots lots more so
check that out but for right now let's
go into what's on my face and we're
going to start where I started which is
face primer i started with today the
laura geller speckle tinted under makeup
primer in ethereal don't let this tint
thing freaked you out the tint isn't
anything there there's really hardly any
tint going on here it's really just a
little bit of a dewy finish but you can
see my face isn't super dewey so it
doesn't really do a whole lot but it
does give you a tad bit of a luminous
glow to your skin so it is very nice I
do like that it does make my makeup
lasts a little bit longer but I mean is
it a must-have I don't know I guess if
you really like to have that little bit
of a luminous glow then maybe but it's
not one that stands out to me as being
like a definitely you must have this in
your collection but it is very not use
today to l'oreal visible lift blur
foundation no one talks about this like
nobody I've never seen anybody talk
about this I've never searched for it
either but none of people that i'm
subscribed to I don't think talk about
this this isn't creamy natural it is has
been out for a little while but this
stuff feels so good to go on oh my gosh
it feels amazing to go on it's very
smooth I think I believe it has some
real good it feels nice but if you have
dry skin this may not work for you
because it definitely isn't moisturizing
in any way but if you have oily skin you
may actually really like this I have
normal skin oh really nice covered it's
a nice solid medium coverage next time I
was trying to reach for a powder that I
haven't showed you yet I don't think
I've used this in a video before this is
the lorac oil-free wet dry powder watch
me have used this last week or something
but I do really like this powder it's
not again nothing fabulous it does kind
of we're through the day
I don't feel like it lasts a really long
time but it works for its initial use
and application it mattifies my skin and
it looks nice I mean I can still see the
ethereal shining through but if I didn't
have that on this would mattify my face
very nicely it's a nice powder is it
anything outstanding ma'am but it's a
nice powder it works okay next up i went
from my eyes and I wet started with the
lorac behind the scenes I primer now
this is not my favorite eye primer
unfortunately I'm very sad that it's not
because it's lorac and I would expect it
to be amazing I don't feel like this
makes my makeup lasts and longer it
doesn't have any kind of pigmentation to
it it looks like it does but it doesn't
as soon as you put it on your skin it
just kind of blends away um I you know I
just it's not i'm not a big fan of their
eye primer I don't feel like it does a
whole lot for me I don't have whaley
lids or anything I have some fine lines
they don't really help with that at all
you know I don't really see much with it
Sorry Sorry lorac so next up I was
looking at my shirt I was on periscope
and periscope is my new addiction and
through a periscope I got to meet a lot
of really great people that are now my
friends we hang out all the time
sometimes multiple times a day on
periscope me and these same group of
people and then some people just kind of
come and go when you're here every once
in a while but we have a blast on
periscope so I did my makeup on
periscope I'm going to show you a little
bit of the makeup that I did while I was
on periscope now keep in mind this was
shot on my iPhone through an app so the
quality may not be fantastic but you'll
kind of get the point so we were looking
at my shirt I'm like what could I do so
I decided to go with the teal today to
kind of go with this someone was
suggesting to use the pink I think it
was Jen says he's the pink it kind of
freaked me out to use the pink so I
didn't use the pink I just wanted to do
the teal so we tried that I started to
put the teal on which is this shay here
from the Vice for palette did I say this
is the vice for palette this is the vice
for palette by urban decay it's new for
the holidays overall with this palette
it's a good palate is it a great palate
no but it's a good palate we'll talk
more about it once we get into the
shadows so I'm going to flip it upside
down so that the me
isn't distracting but this one here is
called what is it going underhand this
is called underhand it's got lots of
glitter in it kind of show you what that
looks like so I put it on my lids and it
just did not look opaque it just looked
lame it looked terrible and I was like
what is going on here what when you do
oh my goodness i forgot i probably
should blank out the discoloration in my
lids so what I did oh I forgot to
mention this because I did actually use
this as concealer totally forgot to
mention it this is a glamour flash like
blendable concealer duo I personally
like the lighter side for me that's just
me personally but I really like this
concealer it's a fantastic concealer
doesn't crease on me I don't usually
have a lot of creasing problems but
every once we'll all find a concealer
that will crease on me this one does not
and it lasts a really long time it's
just a really nice concealer especially
for a drugstore concealer this is by
hard candy if I did not say that already
this is by hard candy and it's called
the glamour flage light so I had used
this as concealer forgot to mention that
but what I decided to do was right over
top of that color I just popped this all
over my lids because I had to get rid of
the discoloration I had to get down a
solid base because it just wasn't
showing up pigmented and I wanted to be
pigmented and it totally fixed it it was
like yes we've made it we've done it we
have the green on the eyes yes okay so
then I was like I don't even know what
to do with that so I was like okay well
i'm gonna go with the sparkly and i'm
going to put this color right here this
one is called grip and i really like
grip but it is darker than it appears
you know it's like images of objects in
the mirror are closer than they appear
shadows in this palette or darker than
they appear so it looks very light but
on my lids it showed up kind of dark
because it's got like that shine to it
where it gets dark so it was too dark
there was nothing in here that was
really helping me i'm like oh gosh what
am I gonna do so I was like ah Mary Lou
to the rescue and we broke out mary-lou
manizer I love this this is a highlight
but this saved my eye look completely I
ended up putting this on the middle of
my eye to the inner corner totally
worked
I end up kind of going back and forth
between the shades that were there
mostly the the green which is called
Arctic mostly between Arctic and this I
kind of went back and forth to kind of
try to get that blend there but this
totally saved me totally saved me I end
up using this as a highlighter as well
Mary low is famous for a reason she's
amazing she's a fabulous highlighter you
see my highlight right there but it's
poppin and it's awesome kind of went out
of order there but that's okay you'll
forgive as I was doing my eyeshadow I
realized I had to do some kind of
transition color and my crease to give
it a little bit of a shadow in my crease
just to make the other colors pump so I
was it oh I haven't used this contour
palette in a while I'm just going to use
this shade this is the Smashbox contour
palette I use this shade in my crease it
didn't really do a whole lot for me but
it's served the purpose I figured I'd
mention it because i did use it and i
think it worked a little bit mmm i do
like that contour palette though but the
elf one is an exact dupont get the smash
by 41 get the elf one the elf one's
amazing the contour palette then i need
to deepen up my outer corner so i
started using this guy delete in my
outer corner i know i keep flipping the
palette like a make up your mind are you
don't write set up or upside down upside
down right center I mean doing upside
down delete is what I put in my outer
corner a bit and that was like you know
what I wanted a little darker than that
so I ended up putting deadbeat in my
outer corner and then blending it up in
so that's what I ended up with and I end
up really liking the look I think it
came out good i'm happy with it and I
feel like the Vice for is a good palate
definitely not my favorite palette for
the holidays for colors if you want a
nice color palette honestly I would
recommend the the movie de loca palette
instead I really like the way that one
performs better but this is a good
palate if you want to try some urban
decay shadows you want to try some
colors out it is kind of fun to play
with but I just don't feel like it's as
easy to work with as the kat von d so
just so yeah I forgot to tell you I did
do my brows today with the a cosmetics
brow pencil I really like this a lot I
think it's a fantastic brow product
there is that there this is in the shade
Universal taupe and it works great for
me I wish it was just a tad bit darker
but I do really like it a lot and it
works well it stays on all day
it fills in my spaces nicely I didn't
get my brows down pretty bad but you
know this helps me as much as I can be
helped at the Skyliner i went to
generation beauty and when I went to
generation beauty i got a creators swag
bag which was full of i don't even know
how many dollars for the stuff like
ridiculous ridiculous one thing that was
in there was tart put a one hundred
dollar gift code in there which was so
generous and nice of them so i went
shopping a bit and i was thinking well
what would people in my channel want to
see and one of the things i've been
really curious about is this chart
tardis a clay paint liner and it was
kind of skeptical about it because i'm
thinking about the benefit whatever it's
called I'll put it right there at the
benefit product that was totally a boss
was supposed to be gel in a pen form and
it just dried out really fast and
supposed to keep the stopper in but they
don't tell you that and it dried out and
I just gave up on it and made me mad so
I was like I hope this isn't like that
man I had fun playing with this I'll
tell you it's a squeezy tube and there's
a little hole there and it squeezes out
but one thing I really like about this
is pretty stick ingenious was it has
this little Bowl here can you see that
it's got this little Bowl there and what
that's for is when you squeeze the
product out you can kind of wipe it
around the little Bowl there so that you
can get the perfect amount on your brush
which i think is absolutely stinking
genius who ever thought of that it's
hard good job it also comes with this
little eyeliner brush which I also think
is super super smart to do because not
everybody has an eyeliner brush and if
you buy this you don't have an eyeliner
brush you are going to be out of luck so
they include one which i think is pretty
awesome and it's a very nice eyeliner
brush it's got a very very fine point it
was very easy to use I really enjoyed
this you just have to make sure there's
no extra clumps or whatever on your
brush and it was really fun to use I
really enjoyed it i'm very happy with
this product now i can't speak to
lasting power because this is the first
time i've used it but really like
initial application really loving it a
lot very very opaque black while we're
talking about eyeliner i did do this a
little bit later in my look but i use a
mr. right now this is a new product by
the bomb this is in the shade Dean it's
just a black eyeliner and it's just very
creamy very opaque very
wearing i have used this before on my
lower lashline it does last very long
time in my waterline last all day on my
lashline just a fantastic eyeliner if
you're looking for a good eye liner the
mr. right now is by the bomb are
fabulous I also put a little bit of this
once believe it or not so far as
eyeliners are actually really really
good this is in the shade Blonde
Ambition I believe yes blonde ambition
and what I did was I put the black just
from here to here and then I took the
blonde ambition and just kind of ran it
all the way over just to give it a
little bit of that shine and I really
like it I've never seen anybody do that
but I do it because I like the way it
looks oh no is it in trend I don't know
I just do it because I like it so then I
got these two gift sets from Tarte to
review for you guys the first one that I
got was a blush set and this one has
four shades there's the ecstatic which
is the nude melon the epic which is
poppy pink and embellish which is a plum
rose and then entertain which is a rose
pink and i swatched all these for my
friends on periscope and we ended up
picking out the top one which is e this
is the nude melon was the one we picked
out and what we decide is that these
things to watch terribly let me see if I
can get a good brush swab and get a good
brush swatch look at that it's just so
pretty so pretty and it's on my cheeks
right now and I'm really liking this so
far again this is the first time use it
so i can't speak the lasting power but
if it lives up to tarp expectations it
lasts all day tart blushes are fab
there's no mirror in these by the way
just so you know if you decide to get
this set from the chart website there's
no mirror it's a $35 set retail value 60
bucks I think if you're trying to try
some tart blushes is definitely a great
way to go or you can give them out you
know as gifts each individual one you
can give them to people nice stocking
stuffers things like that but yes very
much thumbs up on that blush really
really happy with it I really want to do
a full review on all of these but
crossing my fingers time is time is
seriously
for me and apparently dropping things as
an issue for me as well alright so then
I went on to my contour powder and I had
a gift card from beautylish that I had
from when I got a lucky box from them
guess it was like springtime they gave a
20 20 or 25 dollar gift card to spend on
the website and I hadn't used it yet so
I got spent my twenty dollar gift card
and I got a little bit extra so one
thing I got was this Kevin of Quan
bronzing powder this is in medium oh not
run bronzing powder contour powder it's
called the sculpting powder and it's in
medium there we go can I speak and I use
that today I've been using this all week
I've really been loving it lasting power
is pretty good it's not amazing but it's
pretty good by the end of the day I can
might be able to see it the tiniest
little bit but it really is fun to use
very easy to use really enjoying it a
lot so I was on again I was on periscope
and we were looking through the lip
products and we were talking about
different things and I said you know we
definitely decided we wanted to do a
more nude lip because the eyes were so
bright we had to do a nude I broke into
the set and I showed everybody i said
okay and i showed them they come in
these little packages here and i said
okay which one do you think and they
said oh this one right here so what I
did was I put it on my lips and we were
all like no no no okay look at this this
is crazy this is called striking and you
can see the packaging there and look
what happens when I put it on my hand
look how hard that is it's like wait
what what where did that come from
that's not the same color as the
packaging so we all went now and then I
ended up taking that off and then I end
up going with this one this one is
called stunning and there is that there
but it was it was still too bright for
this I look I needed something nice and
calm and this was to brighten
everybody's like add brown add brown and
then somebody said what about your
Charlotte Tilbury lipstick that you just
got and we went aha let's try that so I
put Charlotte over top and Charlotte
kind of took over chuck was like you
know what tart smackdown you are just
out of here and Charlotte took over and
that's what I ended up with so this is
called Hepburn honey and let me swatch
that here and there is that shade on its
own actually
Oh blush watch their let me put it
someplace else let's put it here so you
can really see the color so this is the
Hepburn honey by itself this is the tart
stunning by itself and that's the two
mixed so I have the two mixed on my lips
right now and it was perfect everybody's
like yay thumbs up yes we really have a
great time and it does make a difference
having them together and pairing them I
wasn't sure if Charlotte just completely
took over and you know forget you tart
but it is a nice mix of the two so I'm
happy about that and as far as the
Charlotte Tilbury lipstick I'm really
enjoying it it's very very creaming
lasting power is pretty typical there's
no staining or anything but it feels
good smell is very good it's very like
like creamy-cookie kind of smell is what
it smells like to me maybe like a hint
of mint this it's a really nice lipstick
I hate to say it high-end lipsticks I
feel like a lot of times really are
better than drugstore lipsticks I hate
to say it I'm not saying all but I feel
like it's one of those products that I
feel like lipstick is one of those
things you can invest in and feel okay
about because like drugs or lips it can
be really can get hard fast they can dry
out they can make your lips dry out they
can go on patchy and I feel like
high-end lipsticks a lot of times are
pretty consistently awesome and this is
another example of awesomeness and a lip
product so will I be buying any more of
these probably not anytime soon because
they're stupid expensive but having one
makes me happy and I'm happy that I have
my one so that's it for what's on my
face this week I hope you enjoyed this
