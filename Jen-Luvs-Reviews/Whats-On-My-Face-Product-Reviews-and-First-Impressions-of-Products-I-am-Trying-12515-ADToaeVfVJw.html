and you are watching what's on my face
this is when i tell you everything
that's on my face in this week's episode
of what's up and make up with the makeup
is my makeup news show that goes live
every sunday morning at nine-thirty a.m.
eastern time and this is the video that
i go along with that video so i make
this to go with that and it's usually
posted on what's up a makeup calm
exclusively but once a month it does
show up on my gen louis reviews youtube
channel and it's just some product
reviews of what i used on my face you
can see them on my face right now and
i'll tell you what i thought of them as
i was using them some of them are new to
me some of them are ones that i've been
trying for a while so let's go ahead and
get started where I started and that was
face primer the face primer that I used
this week is the ofra silicone primer
gel this was sent to me by Oprah as part
of a brand review that I'm working on
this is called a silicone primer gel but
do not let it fool you the last
ingredient the very last ingredient in
this is silicon it looks very silicon II
when you squirt it out it even looks
very silicon II but when you blend it in
it does not feel silicon II it just
feels wet very very very wet I would
never put that much on my face by the
way that was just an example don't ever
put that much on your face whenever you
put on face primer your eye primer you
want to point on as little as possible
it really just feels very wet and a
little bit moisturizing just a tad bit
it's it's wet that's all I can really
say about the feeling of it I do feel
like it does make my makeup stay on
longer I do feel like it does what it's
supposed to do as far as making my
foundation look better and all of those
things um it's not like anything that I
say I would say is like a standout
amazing like oh my gosh it makes this
huge huge difference for me and my
normal skin but it is a nice primer and
that's where I'm gonna leave that
product move on to the next product
which was very new to me I've used it a
few times and this is the Sephora CC
cream SPF 20 CC cream I got this from my
sister-in-law it did not work for her
and I realized why this isn't working
for her this is the
second time I've used it it makes my
pores look gigantic I have very small
pores she has like normal people pores
pores that you can see and I can see
where this would accentuate her pores so
if you have non-existent pores this
works very very nice I have small pores
it works fine no one's really gonna
notice unless they're looking like super
up close at my skin no one's gonna
notice I noticed so I'm probably still
going to use this but what I might do is
put on a very light coat of this and
then use it with a powder foundation to
kind of minimize all of that or maybe
some kind of pore filling primer to go
with it but I mean I don't think that I
would purchase this out right and I
don't think for most people i would
recommend purchasing this it does come
out kind of swirly just so you know and
there is a pump on here which is very
very nice i'm glad that it has a pump
but i don't know it's not great that's
correct alright next product what did I
use next Oh the next thing I used was
concealer and this is one that I'm
obsessed with I talk about this all the
time this is the bare minerals concealer
and summer bisque it's amazing it's the
best under eye concealer I've ever used
in my entire life I can't stop using it
I use it again this week that's all I'm
gonna say about it because I've talked
about this thing to death it is fab and
then I skipped face powder because I
knew I want to use a finishing powder
and I didn't want to do too much face
powder so I went straight to eye primer
necks this is a step one eye primer by
Coastal Scents it's an amazing eye
primer it works very very very well it
is I think about 10 bucks on the coastal
sets website I don't know if this is
worth a purchase all on its own but if
you're already ordering something from
coastal scents like the new Coastal
Scents smoky palette that's coming out
very very soon the revealed smoky
palette which I have here is the
packaging for it i'm going to be doing a
full review on this next week but if you
happen to be ordering this i believe
that the release date of this is
december 11th i definitely recommend
picking up their eye primer it's really
really really good if you have the Too
Faced shadow insurance and that works
for you or if you have the
Nick a regular primer potion that works
for you this is very very similar you
probably don't need it but if you were
looking at those and want a cheaper
option this is definitely worth a
purchase will give you a little sneak
peek of the real revealed smoky palette
just because you're here but i'm not
going to do a full review accepting a
full review this week but that's what it
looks like on the inside yes so make
sure you subscribe since you don't miss
that video that comment this coming week
after my eye primer today i used this a
fabulous naked 3 palette by urban decay
this is the first time that i have used
this I got this as a gift from my friend
Mandy hashtag para loves thank you so
much for sense to me I appreciate it so
much this is the first time I've used it
and I can tell you that I really really
really really really like it a lot but
girlfriend if you do not like pink do
not buy this okay that's straight up if
you are even concerned at all about
wearing pink on your eyes this is not
worth a purchase at all I mean these
shades are pink pink pink pink pink I
got my pink shirt a little pink
eyeshadow we're good to go I mean you
can kind of neutral it up a little bit
with these those are the shades I used
today I use nooner no I use liar all
over my lid I used factory up in the
crease and then I use dark side to
deepen up the crease then I mix dust and
strange in my inner corner and I use
strange on my brow bone but this is
definitely I would say if you're a pink
lover definitely go for it if you're not
skip it that is after one use though I
haven't tested lasting power of this so
this is just upon initial application
after that I went into yes after that I
went into my essence gel eyeliner this
stuff is so good it is so good and it
was so cheap you can get this at Ulta if
you're looking to try a gel eyeliner
you've never tried a Joey island before
this is a great option because if you
end up not liking it you're not out a
lot of money I do recommend that you get
a very skinny pencil brush with this let
me show you what I used okay you want to
use something that is similar to this
very very very thin a brush something
like this is going to be way too thick
you don't want something like that you
definitely want something like this very
very skinny even skinnier than that
would be even better if you can find it
essence probably even sells a brush that
can go with this but it's really good
it's really really good very creamy very
easy to apply lasting power is very good
if you do rub your eye like if you do a
wing and you rub your eye through the
day you'll probably end up rubbing your
wing off but if you don't rub your eyes
this will be fine for all day where it's
really nice oh I did get this in the
generation beauty swag bag just this
full disclosure I did not pay for this
but they don't know that I'm making this
video hashtag not sponsored all right
after I did that I did a little bit of
tight lining this is the Smashbox always
sharp waterproof kohl liner it's really
neat because especially if you're going
to use an eyeliner for travel this is
great because in order to open this you
do actually have to twist it and the
twisting will sharpen the pencil for you
there's a built-in sharpener so I don't
know how that affects the the last thing
of the product I haven't found that any
of the product is coming out so i don't
know if it's just kind of shaping it
shaping it orbits actually sharpening it
i haven't used it too many times and i
did use this just for tight lining and i
really like it for that purpose it
doesn't transfer it's a nice eyeliner I
got this with Sephora 100-point perk for
sephora i believe yes no i got this as
an Ipsy point perk i believe either way
I can't remember i'm pretty sure i got
this is an FC point perk I didn't
purchase this out right I always like to
tell you guys but again Smashbox does
not know that I'm making this video ok
eyebrows this week I used an oldie but a
goodie this is the YBF it's called your
best friend automatic eyebrow pencil and
universal taupe it's been a hot minute
since I've used this and I don't know
why because it's it's just an amazing
eyebrow pencil I actually really like
this better than the Anastasia brow Wiz
because I feel like this goes on a lot
more evenly it's a lot easier to apply
it's a thicker point so it doesn't take
as much work from my particular browse
if you have stream leaf in browser you
may like the brow is better but if you
have like my size browse this is works
great absolutely great i don't have
super thick brows it's wonderful i have
nothing else to say about it like and
then it's got the spoolie on the other
side and everything
it's just the perfect eyebrow pencil
this is I think it's I want to say it's
kind of mid-range price I think it's a
little less than the anastacio but it's
more than like a drugstore price and you
can get these at their website at the
YBF website alright next four eyes I use
these seal a huge mascara this is very
similar in brush and formula to the
better than sex mascara I do like it
better than the better than sex mascara
the better than sex mascara clumped up
right away on me this I'm not finding
quite as much clumping but it's a
similar kind of effect so if you like
the better than sex and you want to try
something different try to steal a huge
I really like it a lot I haven't found
it to be flaky or it doesn't transform
me i do not have watery eyes though so
if you have watery eyes i can't speak to
that but for my normal eyes that don't
water a lot and really really enjoying
this a lot a lot of volume a lot of
length all of that it was in my monthly
favorites for november i'll leave a link
to my monthly favorites down below if
you want to see what else my favorites
were that essence gel eyeliner was
recently in my best of generation beauty
swag bag video that i put up last week
so i'm going to link that video down
below as well if you want to see other
favorites for blush this week i use my
wet and wild pearlescent pink blush this
is another oldie but a goodie this is of
extremely reliable blush if I don't know
what to wear this is a great one of
course very inexpensive very long where
time on this very easily buildable
easily blendable this is a fantastic
blush I would anybody talk about the wet
and wild blushes in a while and they
should be talked about roll time like
all the time everybody should we talk
about these they're so good so good this
one does have a little bit like it says
pearlescent pink it does have a little
bit of a shine to it oh it's not a
glitter but it's a little bit of a
shimmer to it so just be aware if you're
going to get this one if you don't like
a shine try heather silk that's another
really good one it's a little deeper
than this but it's very very nice and
then for contour this week i use my
little mini burberry this is light glow
number seven it's called earthy blush
and this is wonderful i don't think i'll
be purchasing a full size of this
because i feel like this is enough for
me but it really is a wonderful contour
for my skin tone I feel like if you're
any deep
than me this may not work but light
medium light to light medium skin tones
I think this is a wonderful wonderful
product if you're looking for a splurge
item then for highlight this week I
wanted to try this again it's been a
while since I've tried it this is the
Beca highlight in opal in the cream form
or the liquid form whatever you call it
liquid for my guess is what you call it
does it have any kind of special
shimmering skin Perfector spotlights I
got this at a holiday set last year I
need to put more love into them because
they're not gonna last a whole lot
longer and I do like it I just I prefer
the powdered highlights more than the
cream highlight so I have a feeling I'm
not going to use these too much longer I
may pass these on to somebody that likes
them more just for the next few months
until they go bad but it's like I'm also
you want to pass them on at this point
because they're just they're getting old
and I'm dropping it yeah they're they're
just getting old so I don't know these
will probably just end up it's kind of a
waste but i don't really like them that
much they're not bad though I mean like
you can see my highlight its poppin it's
just I don't prefer the cream formula
then for finishing powder finishing
powder i use the Mary Kay translucent
loose powder i really like this as a
finishing powder it leaves my face with
just a really nice finish exactly what
it says it's a nice finishing powder I
think it helps my makeup stay on longer
and it just gives a nice look to the
skin I really like it a lot and it is it
doesn't it doesn't look white once you
blend it into the skin it's a white
powder it's kind of messy but but it
works very very well and the last thing
that I'm going to be talking about today
is the lipstick that i'm wearing it's
not even really technically a lipstick
according to two phases to lip balm this
is called pink slip and in this their la
creme lip balms when I swatch it you can
see there's definitely color there if
you're looking to try out some what
colors you're not used to wearing lip
colors i definitely recommend these the
only thing is is they have a weird funky
smell it's very chemically like almost
like it's trying to be sweet but it's
not like it's not pulling it off well
where the regular lip creme lip sticks
have a really nice like sweets no please
do not pull it off their kind of
chemically but if you can get past that
there are really nice
let products and the packaging is
gorgeous it's really that's it for
