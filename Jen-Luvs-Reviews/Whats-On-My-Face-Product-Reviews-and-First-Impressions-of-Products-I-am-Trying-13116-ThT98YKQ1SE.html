hello my friends welcome to what's on my
face where I tell you everything that's
on my face and this week's episode of
what's up and make up this video is
typically housed on what's up in makeup
calm I put it out every single week on
what's up a makeup calm as a thank you
for visiting the website so if you enjoy
this episode make sure in future weeks
if you're curious of once on my face and
a particular what's my makeup episode
you can go straight to the website and
find out product reviews on everything I
use that week so without further ado
let's go ahead and get into what i use
this week and we're going to go ahead
and start where i started which was face
primer now the face primer that I used
was actually the first face primer I
ever tried I had gotten this in an Ipsy
bag back in 2012 I got it again in a
Birchbox i guess it was probably at
least a year ago but it's been sitting
in the back of my drawer and i
completely forgot about and i saw it
today i was a ball oh my goodness I
forgot I even had this with it let got
shoved to the back you know how that
happens sometimes it is a silicon based
primer it kind of reminds me of the
Smashbox primer and one thing I realized
today because I hadn't used it a well as
I put on way too much this is the
perfect amount for your entire face and
when you rub this all of your face it
just feels so silky and smooth I do feel
like it makes my makeup lasts all day
and it just feels really good so if you
like the primer from Smashbox I
definitely recommend trying and this one
out it does have a little bit of a
plastic he sent those so just be aware
of that if you're sensitive the sense
you may not like this but its
performance wise it's fantastic speaking
of primer today I use for my eye primer
at the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
potion anti-aging this does live up to
the Urban Decay primer potion reputation
it is really wonderful if you're looking
for an anti-aging product this actually
does work if you use it religiously if
you use it everyday I have seen
anti-aging effects I have not used this
religiously for a really long time so I
can't the effects are gone they're
completely gone but i dint least all my
lids getting more talked when i did use
this and it does make my a show stay on
all day long so if you're looking for
the anti-aging effect on your lids
highly recommend this primer the
packaging
lately different now than this one but
it's a really really wonderful I
foundation today I use this Navy or a
yagi foundation I had gotten this in the
FC bag and then repurchased really
really like this um and it did
unfortunately take two coats to build up
to medium though so if you like a later
coverage foundation you'll probably like
this better than if you like a more full
coverage foundation because it in a
little bit more work this is in the
shade buff by the way and but I do enjoy
it just takes a little work to build up
need coverage of a face powder this week
I use one of my favorite powders which
is the best may brightening vanilla
powder translucent and this just feels
luxurious to put it on it just feels
nice it's a very finely milled powder
you can use the little poof if you like
I find that it slips off of my hands so
I don't typically use the poof what I do
because it is a loose powder as I'll tap
it off into the cap and the poof does
give it a very nice feeling and the
proof feels really good it's very nice
but using a fluffy brush as well leaves
a really nice finish and it smells like
vanilla like if you think about the Too
Faced chocolate products it's like that
but vanilla scented if you ever happen
to run into this in the store i
definitely recommend just smelling it
and if you can get your hands on it to
touch it and feel it on your skin it
just feels really good concealer this
week i tried out once again the benefit
fakeup i got a sample of this and I do
like it my samples almost gone this is
really good for people that have dry
under eyes and it has a moisturizing
outside and then the concealer is in the
core so as you put on you really feel
that hydration going into your skin so
if you have dry under eyes I definitely
recommend trying this it's very very
nice mine is in the shade light it's a
perfect shape for me I'm typically a
light medium skin tone so if you are
very light this may not be light enough
for you but if you are of a light medium
skin tone then the light will probably
be very good for you so definitely
recommend us for dry under eyes anybody
else it probably won't work very well
you're not the target market girlfriend
if you don't have dry on guys eyebrows
this week I use a product that I've been
meaning to review this is the smashbox
brow shaping powder this is relatively
new on it comes out like an old style
liquid eyeliner
and then the product is housed inside of
here one thing if you are looking for
Instagram brows and you like like that
long Stassi a dip brow pomade and you
want to try something different I
definitely recommend trying this this
gives the same kind of effect as like
the dipbrow pomade if you want it to be
a little more subtle a little more
natural you just have to be careful and
just really put it on gently because
this is an intense product and as you
can hear it's very loud I don't really
know what the purposes of the little
tiny ball in the cap because there's no
product up there I think it's just maybe
just for auditory happiness I don't know
but the product overall is very nice the
lasting power is very good there and
it's a powder so you don't have to wait
you definitely we're going to want to
set it with some kind of gel or
something if your eyebrows don't stay in
place because it definitely doesn't do
anything like that but it's a very
opaque powders this is in the shade dark
brown and it's a perfect shape for my
hair color eye shadow today I've been
hearing a little bit of comments a
little bit of whispers about how it
always wear the same I look all of the
time so we went a little crazy today and
ready and you always gonna have to
balance out my color with some neutrals
because what I tend to do what I want to
wear some color is all pop a color all
over my lid or I'll pop a color up into
the crease or a pop of color on my lower
lash line I just pick one place to put
that color and everywhere else gets
neutral mats everywhere else gets
neutral matte so the perfect thing for
neutral mats is the Urban Decay Naked
basics or the Naked basics to is a great
like supplemental palette to give you
some neutral Mets to blend with brighter
colors so what I did was I put um I put
frisk in the crease of trying not to
have a reflection of the light the frisk
up in the crease I used yes and then i
use primals deepen up the outer corner
and then i used undone to deepen it up
even further and then i used in the my
galaxy chic talent by BH Cosmetics this
is a wonderful child I think it's like
twelve dollars on the bhcosmetics
website this is a wonderful wonderful
bright shadow palette I use common here
all over the lid
use a little bit of meteor toward the
inner corner and then I needed something
else so I just kind of gently dipped
into my lorac mega Pro to and grabbed
out this gun metal shade here which is
very very nice so I use that just kind
of in the inner corner to brighten it up
gives a little more complexity so that
was my eye look for today to try to make
it a little more fun than what I
normally wear on a typical video you
know my big brain you just throw
something else in there who cares if
it's the middle of winter let's go some
reg or eyeliner today I use the julep
fluid I glider in jet black and i really
love Penn eyeliners I know some people
do not like them they are my absolute
favorite formula of eyeliner I
personally feel like they are the
easiest to use they go on so smoothly if
you get a good one the julep one has
taken some breaking in but it is really
nice it's very very black you see the
tip is very very sharp and pointy makes
it very easy to make a nice wing I feel
like with pencils there's just no way I
can make a way with a pencil I just
can't do it it's not in my talents I
can't but with a pen I've got that wing
like I totally got it gives me
confidence in being able to do a wing
when I have a a pen liner so definitely
recommend the jeweled one just know that
it's going to be a little stiff when you
get it but the more you work with it
it'll kind of you know it'll you'll
break it in a little bit and will be a
little easier to use the more you use it
but it's a really nicely put i'm going
to mascara i use my it cosmetics hello
lashes this is a really nice mascara
it's not my favorite mascara of all time
but it does give some nice length some
nice volume but it's definitely not like
a WOW factor mascara for me but it's
good it's good it's got this little
Baldy thing on it it's really nice for
the lower lashes I personally don't
prefer mascara on my lower lashes it's
just not my thing so I I just use this
on my upper lashes today and it's nice
it's fine one time though I accidentally
got a big clump of this in my eyeball
and my eyes like lit up like fire it was
horrible i had to redo my whole I look
it was horrible so just be careful if
you do get this whatever you do do not
get it in your high it's really
really bad experience so and I've never
had that experience with mascara in my
entire life so yes just be careful of
that it's not meant to go in the eye but
just be careful it's all for contour
today I broke into another old favor
this is the Smashbox contour palette and
these are the shades here these are
exact duplicates don't feel like you
need to invest in this one but if you do
see this at Sephora um it is a really
really nice contour palette if you want
to invest in a more expensive one
honestly though you can just go for the
elfin get the exact same effect but the
pigmentation is wonderful on these
products let me just kind of show you
where we're going here I don't have
anywhere swatch because i had a lipstick
fiasco i'm going to tell you about a
second but just really nice subtle
colors that the contour shade is perfect
so perfect the bronzer shade is very
nice a highlight shade it's a matte
highlight so it's more for like under i
setting powder and just subtle
highlights not a pop and highlight but
this contour powder gets some love get
some love it's all really nice contour
palette but again just get the elf it's
an exact your blush today i used a tart
blush that i got in the holiday kit that
I gotten this is in embellish it's a
gorgeous gorgeous blush it looks mad but
it's got a tad bit of sparkle just built
into it and it's very very nice just a
nice in from the cold kind of flush
color very very pretty very blendable
very buildable really really nice color
if you could ever come upon embellish
it's wonderful highlight today i have a
new highlight that i had never tried
before this is the first time i've used
it this is the artist patois diamond
glow powder in ES and this is mack daddy
if you know him on youtube he's a makeup
artist this is his company and this is
straight-up glitter it is glitter
glitter glitter glitter glitter there's
nothing subtle about this highlight this
is a poppin while I don't know if you
can how much is going on me I feel like
it's glowing pretty good i'm looking
monitor life I think I'm glowing let me
show you what it looks like over here
just very very very sparkly just whoo
girlfriend like this is like a night out
kind of sparkle right there really
really bold really low but fun very fun
and I'm not afraid of a pop and
highlight I love top and highlights so
for lips I had a little Fiasco with the
lips because of the bright I I had
trouble getting a lip that would book
okay with this and I'm still not one
hundred percent sure I was getting ready
on periscope as I always do and they
were really helping me a lot trying to
figure out what I was going to do I
started off with this violet boss which
is brand new it's in lust it was too
dark and too Brown like it was just too
much I'll just kind of put it right here
just really brown brown brown just it
didn't look good I'm not with the eyes
not with the eyes so then my friend Nick
he said you know top it with Sapa solo
from colour-pop so that's what we did
this is solo from colour-pop and that
may it kind really nice but it was a
little too pinky so then we popped a
little bit of Angeles from Oprah on top
of that show you that and that lighten
it up just a little bit and then to make
it even more calm then we added a little
bit of tarts Park Avenue princess this
is a lip gloss over top and that just
gave a little sparkle in the center so
that is a concoction sunny my lip combo
it's a lift concoction we made tonight
and I ended up really liking it I I'm so
thankful for my friends on periscope
helping me out we had so much fun
tonight getting ready it took me like an
hour and a half to get ready but we had
a blast like the hair thing was the hair
was a thing it was I can't even go into
