loans reviews and you are watching
what's on my face where I tell you
everything that's on my face for this
week's episode of what's been makeup i'm
also going to tell you what's on my
shirt this is the shirt that I designed
I drew this on a piece of paper and then
I ended indoor cheap and it says men
love Genlis reviews these are available
on cafepress com I really make a very
very small percentage they can make a
ten percent commission off things so
please don't think this is a huge money
maker for me it's just something fun
than I did for our community there's the
mad love design there's the collective
brain of makeup awesomeness and then
there are things for the paralyzed my
friends that are on periscope and
definitely check that so that we got
phone cases and shirts and all kinds of
cool stuff so just search for Jem those
reviews on cafepress or what's the make
up to find the merchandise it's a lot of
fun coffee mugs stuff like that oh so
this video is typically only available
on what's up in makeup calm this week is
the week that it shows up on the channel
so if you'd like to see more episodes of
this go ahead to what's up and makeup
calm and go to the exclusive content
you'll see previous episodes of what's
on my face they're so now let's go ahead
go into what's on my face we're going to
start where I started which is face
primer I started off with my Laura
Mercier face primer radiance I really
like this face primer it's nothing like
magical I don't feel like it really
gives me a lot of radiance that shine
through the foundation I feel like if
you're going to use something that's
really light coverage then it might make
a difference as far as ah you know the
the radiance aspect of it um show you
there it's more kind of a wet look but
if you're just going to put foundation
over it it kind of disappears you can
see the only radiance that I have right
now really is the highlight that I have
on so I mean it's fine it's a nice face
primer down like use my makeup on much
much longer but it's definitely not a
must buy for me and for foundation I had
to try this again this is the Physicians
Formula mineral where it's helped free
all in one ABC cushion foundation SPF 50
in light medium I just put a review of
this wasn't really a review was more
like a try on demo kind of thing kind of
giving you the opportunity to see how it
wore on
me my there's some cool music in the
background and it was more like I was
kind of testing a format out and what I
learned from about 25 people was that I
applied it incorrectly so I mean you can
see the way that it looks based on the
application that i did but what I can
tell you is I did decide that i was
going to Pat it on today I also did two
layers of it instead of one and it did
build up to a lighter to medium coverage
when I did two layers I might have been
able to build it up more but I
personally don't like that look so I
didn't but it might have been able to
build up to more I did only use the
sponge today and I did it in a patting
motion I do really like that much better
using it in the patting motion rather
than the swiping motion but you know you
live and you learn I do still feel like
the the the review is valid the
application of it is valid because
that's what it looks like when you apply
it that way but there are other ways to
apply it so look for this foundation to
show up again in videos on my channel
I'm probably going to put the Leumi i
tested against the the l'oreal lumi one
i did order that from Ulta so hopefully
we'll see that soon but so far I mean
even the way that I swiped it on I
really like that for a day to day
coverage it feels very nice on the skin
it's kind of watery it's definitely not
a thick foundation in any way and I do i
do like the way that it applies overall
even when I do do a light application I
really enjoy the way even to my skin
tone so that's kind of my opinion on
this at this point I do still want to
play with a little bit more i'm sure
you'll see this again sometime soon on
the channel though i watched a bunch of
videos on the cushion foundation formula
and they recommend it and everything
that i read and everything I saw to put
on your concealer after you put on the
cushion foundation so today i use my eve
pearl duel salmon concealer and i use
the deeper shade here this is the shade
fairlight and i use the deeper shade
today i really like the way that this
looks I love the coverage of it and it
is a salmon color so does cancel out the
any kind of purpleness you know dark
circles it's God think that peachy
salmon color and and it's very very nice
concealer it is a bit pricey but if
you're looking for a good cancelling out
blueness under your eyes I definitely
men trying this out as a concealer /
corrector I I can see being used for
both I use it personally as a concealer
rather than a corrector though okay then
I went straight into eyes and I used to
put a lid on it I primer by the ball I
just looked up the ingredients of this
primer just so you know the first
ingredient is a solvent the second one
is talc and the third one is an
emollient so there's no silicone in the
first three ingredients but tell a lot
of people are very sensitive to so just
be aware of that if you want to get this
I do feel like it keeps my eyeshadow on
longer but not as long as some of my
other primers so after I stopped filming
last night I realized I really wanted to
do a little more research into the
ingredients of the eyelid primer so with
the bomb I compared it to the elf eyelid
primer it does include five of the same
ingredients as the elf eyelid primer
including the first ingredient and the
third ingredient also when I I did
decide to compare it to the Too Faced
shadow insurance and they share the same
top four ingredients and 13 ingredients
overall which is a total of sixty five
percent we're with the elf I'm where
it's forty five percent it also shared
sixty-five percent of the ingredients
with the Urban Decay primer potion and
also the same first four ingredients are
the same in the Urban Decay primer
potion so I thought that was kind of
interesting to compare just for fun i
looked at the difference between the two
face and the urban decay and they shared
eighty percent of the same ingredients
including the first five ingredients in
the same order which i thought was
really interesting i had a lot of things
going on my eyes today the first thing I
used was a coastal scents hot pot in
like taupe this is a wonderful wonderful
hot pot I had a lot of questions lately
on my feelings about the Coastal Scents
hot pots let's double swatch right there
overall I really like them there are
some hits and misses in the hot pot but
overall I feel like they are very good
and for the price i feel like if you get
a couple of misses you know i would say
eighty percent of hot pots that they own
a really really good and then twenty
percent are just kind of
yeah like they're they're usable but
they're not great you know any mean but
this happens to be a really good one I
really like this one I want to use this
one up in my crease up in the crease and
then i use i wanted to try this out this
is the Coastal Scents duo that I got in
my hip see back birchbox I got it in my
birchbox and it is the style eyes
eyeshadow sampler and this was the first
time i use it i thought it was okay it
definitely swatched worse than it
actually was I was not impressed with
the swatches but then when I used it
actually turned out pretty nice you can
see that the cream shade is very powdery
looking that's one swatch but they're
okay they're all right um again I feel
like I have some coastal scents I showed
us that I like better than these I feel
like the burgundy shade is a little bit
chunky but it did blend out pretty
nicely and I like the way that looks I
happen in my outer corner a little bit
blended up into the crease and I do
really like it but then I wanted
something for all over my lid and I just
got in a jewel mystery box if you've
never checked out the jewel mystery
boxes oh my gosh they're amazing $25 its
mystery stuff so you never know what
you're gonna get but I got like five
polishes and like I got this eyeshadow
and a cheap product and an eyeliner and
lipgloss 25 bucks you cannot beat it so
this is something that i got i did use
just this shade today this one is called
broadway and it is so gorgeous
absolutely gorgeous it's just like a
gold champagne II gold color and it's
just so so so pretty I'm really really
happy with their eyebrows today I used
my on estancia dip brow pomade this is
starting to get a little bit old but
it's still hanging strong I I really
like this a lot it's a little more
difficult to work with than a powder or
a pencil but it will give you more
Instagram eyebrows like that was really
defined brows if you really like that I
always have to spoolie mine out because
it never looks natural until I spoolie
it out so just be aware of that if you
do get this it's very very creamy so it
makes it a little more difficult to work
with but it is really nice prod they
also use the benefit gimme brow this is
very
for people that already have filled in
brows or something to use at the end
after you filled in your brows to kind
of bring it all together it's supposed
to have fibers in it but you don't feel
like the fibers really do much it is a
very nice product though I really enjoy
using it it's just not a standalone brow
product for me it's something that I use
at the end to kind of make it all work
and also it kind of helps my brow stay
in place but it doesn't have a crunchy
feel like let's say the honest Tavia joe
brow stuff it's like crunch city this is
definitely better than that in my
eyeliner today I used my shoe a kitten
liner I was pleasantly surprised by this
when I first opened it up I wasn't quite
sure how I was going to like it because
the tip was very stiff it has does have
a brush temper no it's a marker tip it
has a very very fine point on it and it
does the perfect amount of product the
only thing is if you do have fine lines
you want to keep a brush handy to blend
out if it seeps into your fine lines to
click on like an angled liner brush or
something like that to kind of blend out
any seeping into fine lines but other
than that it's really really good last a
really long time don't write with the
side of your eye if you made a wing
though because it will wipe off even
like hours later but it does stay on as
long as you don't wipe your eyes it will
stay on all day it's a really nice liner
very very black to which I really pay
for mascara say I was getting ready on
periscope and I was like I'm gonna try
this Alta mascara for you because I've
used it before and it's terrible so I
just want to show you how bad it is and
that's why we're going to use it and I
ended up not hating it as much as I
thought I would I had used this two or
three times before I felt like it did
absolutely nothing this time I felt like
it did a little bit more I still don't
recommend it this is called the
legendary lengths lengthening mascara by
ulta and it's just it's kind of weak if
you already have nice lashes you'll
probably like this but if you have like
shortness or sparseness or anything like
that it's pretty weak there's a lot of
much much better mascaras than this one
show you the wand it's kind of that
two-faced better than sex shape but you
can see it's very very very thin thin
formula it does
home do the lashes very very nicely
which is nice but overall it's just not
a great mascara it's not bad if you get
it like one of those deals where you can
get like 10 ulta brand products for free
or something this is one you might want
to pick up but if you're not getting if
you're spending more than like a couple
bucks for it I definitely wouldn't
recommend this is like the julep what's
 makeup I use this julep cheek
stick this is called to skip the brush
and it's in Desert Rose this is a
gorgeous gorgeous blush it doesn't have
the best staying power ever but it's
really beautiful on the cheese has got
that shine to it and it's really
gorgeous it's fun to work with I can see
this working on many skin tones it's
just beautiful to work with I really
enjoy it a lot I did use this without
any powder first I do feel like when you
put it on over top of the powder it can
kind of give a strange finish so i make
sure before i use this that I don't put
a powder on first I'll put it right on
top of my foundation I think it looks
absolutely gorgeous it's a nice wintry
kind of color too and I just really like
this product is super super creamy this
is one of those kind of blushes you can
throw in your purse because it's like
hardcore not going to open up and at
least that I I mean it's like I'm
pulling on it and I'm not getting it
open i have to like grab it with my
whole hand this would not be difficult
to put on when you're out on the go so
put the stripe on and then I splendid
out my fingers super easy now for
contouring today I did use the wet and
wild contouring palette this is the new
formula I really like this a lot overall
I do feel like the bronzer and this is a
bit warm this is in Dulce Dolce don't
say de leche yes but I really like this
they're both extremely met formulas
they're very very creamy very creamy
there you go so there is the bronzer
there is the highlight it is a bit warm
in the bronzer so just be aware of that
it's not really the best contouring
bronzer but I mean it's just I don't
know I like that it's so it's such a the
formula i would just wish that they had
made the shade a little more neutral and
a little less warm and then i would have
been super happy with it the white shade
I used to brighten my under
I i also use it for a little bit of
brightening here and i really liked a
lot it's just it's a little bit too warm
and it makes me sad i want to love it
but I just don't um as far as a contour
shade you can also use it as I shadow to
if you don't want to use it as a contour
you can use it as a bronze or to see I'm
trying to sell this because I really
like the formula I just don't love the
shade I really wanted to love it and
there's nice little directions on the
back to there's just good for any time
so just doesn't really work for this
proper highlight my highlight of the
year the Laura Geller baked gelato swirl
illuminator and gilded honey this is
gorgeous it's a beautiful highlight is
down there just oh the glow the glow my
friends the below 0 so pray so pretty oh
every time I put it on it makes me go oh
I just love it so much and then I used
for finishing powder today I use the
tart smooth operator this is a new
favorite of mine this is the press
version there is a loose version as well
but very very nice finishing powder I
was a little scared because of the
whiteness of it but it definitely
doesn't leave a white cast I feel like
it just really brings everything
together into one full look you know it
brings my cheek look together it just
brings everything and just makes it look
good you know just makes my face look
good and it makes me happy all right
before I did my lips today I if you know
me you know I have chronically dry lips
so I constantly have to exfoliate I used
today the tarte maracuja lip exfoliant
and I think my husband John bought this
a really long time ago it's very very
minty but it works really really well
the grains are like medium to fine
grains in there and it just it works
really well it's very nice it's
moisturizing and it just feels good on
the lips I really recommend this if you
can find I fought with my lips tonight I
fought with them I could not figure out
a lip color and that looked right I
couldn't and then my friend Valerie on
periscope was like you have touch of
spice by Maybelline I was like yes I
happen to have that I pulled it out of
my drawer I put it on and I was like yes
Valerie for the win you're amazing so
because of Mallory I found the right
color for my lips that's my love getting
ready on periscope if you're not
following on Paris
it really is a lot of fun we have a
great time and you guys help me and I
help you and we're all just a good happy
helping each other family but yeah this
is such a spice by Maybelline it's a mat
and it's wonderful and I love it it's a
beautiful color and still moisturizing I
mean I've been wearing it for prob about
half an hour and it still feels moist
there's no dryness at this at all it's
just it's a wonderful lip product sent
on this it's a little bit sweet but it's
not overpoweringly sweet it's not like
the Milani ones it's just a little bit
sweet it's not real plasticky either
it's maybe a tad plasticky but it's not
bad it's not bad at all so really nice
list then finally I wanted to show you
my my nail polishes that I'm wearing I
have been wearing this nail polish on my
nails for almost a week and I like
seriously like look how gorgeous this
color is I mean they're not perfect
anymore but oh my gosh this is a mix of
two julep nail polishes that I got in
that mystery box one this one is called
hazel and this one is called Layla now
my only concern about Layla is it's got
these big like crystals in there it's
got these big rectangles the rectangles
peeled off of my nails so like with this
one right here you can see where they've
peeled off which does not look cute but
the rest of it looks cute what you can
do if you do get this and you plan on
wearing it for a long time is when the
big rectangles go on your nails just
pick them off with a pair of tweezers so
that they don't stay in your nails and
it smooths itself out as long as you do
it quickly enough because the small
little flecks are gorgeous then you
don't really need the large rectangles
so overall really recommend these as a
pair i haven't worn them separately so i
can't speak them severally but as a pair
oh it looks like you know my old EFC bag
that i got couple months ago that's what
it reminds me of like a night sky kind
of look it's just gorgeous so I thank
