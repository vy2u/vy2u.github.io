come on my friends books for what's on
my face where I'll tell you everything
that's on my face and this week's
episode of what's up and makeup so we're
going to go ahead and start where I
started which was not face primer but
some kind of weird wrinkle thing that
I'm going to show you in a second the
instant wrinkle filler by hydroxatone is
what i put on my forehead today now I
definitely see an instant difference
when I put this on my forehead but as
far as like overall like minimizing of
wrinkles I feel like it doesn't really
do as much they hoped it would like my
wrinkles are still still definitely
prominent and drives me nuts but I do
feel like this helps a little bit I
think this is much better for fine lines
than it is for wrinkles so it is what it
pays primary that I use today is the
Laura Mercier foundation primer in
radiance that's what I used all over my
face I am trying to use this up it's a
very nice face primer as long as you
don't use any kind of mattifying
products you will get radiance with this
but as soon as you put any kind of
mattifying foundation or powder or
anything on there you will lose a lot of
the radiance so definitely keep that in
mind if you're going to purchase
speaking of that foundation today I use
is the Marc Jacobs marvelous mousse in
bisque light this is a very old product
I really need to use this up this is
definitely at least year old I did do a
full review on this it's drying out but
I can't bear to part with it because it
is marc jacobs and it was very expensive
so i can't bear to part with it but i
can't wear it on an everyday basis
because it is a more medium to full
coverage foundation i don't know if you
can tell the difference in my face but
it's definitely more of a full coverage
foundation it's not what i typically
wear so that's kind of why I still have
it left but ya know you know you know we
just use it up things until they're gone
and even if there's bad i have trouble
throwing it away especially i spend
money on it and i apply that today with
the beauty junkies Beauty Blender ish
thing it's very similar in shape to the
to the Real Techniques sponge but I do
feel like it feels more like a Beauty
Blender it's definitely less dense than
the Real Techniques one I do want to get
a Beauty Blender so I can compare it
right to the Beauty Blender so I have to
purchase that before I give a full
review of this I also use a bunch of you
junkies brushes I'm going to be doing a
full review on their highlighting set
and there I brush set there are some of
the brushes that come with the sets and
again I'm going to do a full review on
these but some of my favorite brushes in
here are definitely the Oliver shader
it's a very ordinary brush but it's very
nice i like the pro highlighter brush a
lot i also really like i'm surprised the
pencil brush even though it's kind of
scratchy it definitely works really
really well this is one of my least
favorite was the duo fiber even though
it really does apply blush nicely for
some reason something about it just
doesn't sit right with me but it works
really well I don't know my favorite
brush that I've tried so far is the pro
sculptor brush this is fabulous that's
how I did my contour day we'll talk
about more about that in a minute also I
really really like the the tapered
blending brush this is fabulous and also
the crease brush is really nice I mean
they're very nice or very affordable you
can get them on Amazon I believe but
there again there's gonna be a full
review later on and I'll probably some
kind of discount code too so you might
want to put off for a minute on that if
you want to discuss but they are
extremely reasonably priced so let me
jump on it you know it's up to you again
I'm still testing them and I'm still
waiting to do on the full review on it's
a collaboration with my friend terry Lee
over terry Lee nifty and thrifty so look
forward to that in the next few weeks
next up for concealer today is the
instant age rewind eraser for dark
circles by Maybelline I think this is
getting kind of old like I think this is
dying i don't think i used it fast
enough and I think it's dying it doesn't
seem to be as effective as it used to be
so I think I might have to throw this
way that makes him really sucks it's a
really good product but it's just not
working the way it used to and I really
think that it's just getting kind of old
so that's going to have to go away
alright moving on to happy things the
mirror ness I primer I use this all the
time this is the secret sexy secret eye
primer and it is an opaque I primer so
when you put it on it does mute out
discolorations so I really like that at
that a lot but it's not so cake that
it's going to give you like if you have
a deeper skin tone it'll just kind of
give you a lighter shade of your natural
skin tone and it'll be evened out at
least that's what I believe would happen
that's what I would imagine how
kind of what happens to me that it
doesn't change my skin tone and more
just makes it all the lighter color and
evens it out and also how smash how to
stay on long on longer which is a good
thing for eyeshadow today I got the
peanut butter jelly ballot oh my gosh
and it really is good it really is good
my biggest complaint about this so far
is this like what is that what is this
like it barely like you barely have to
touch it for it to open which I don't
like also I think this contributes to so
if like I take this out we'll see if it
stays closed better no it still doesn't
stay closed better like it just pops
right open so this is not good for
travel it seems like it would be because
it's a 10 but it's not you do have a
little mirror back there once you take
out the little guy to have some looks in
here but oh my goodness oh my goodness
so easy to work with so easy to wear
with definitely worth the purchase if
the shades are calling to you definitely
recommend it as far as the smell
everybody's talking about the smell I
feel like it smells very artificial
compared to the original chocolate bar
palette you know the way that you would
have like a peanut butter flavored candy
kind of thing instead of like real
peanut butter it smells more like reeses
pieces mixed with a little bit of
chocolate sense so it smells very good
it's just not a true peanut butter sense
the quality the shadows perfect perfect
we could kind of show you that I look
that I've got going on today I'll tell
you what colors I use so i use all over
the lid i use the i use spread the love
from here to here from here to here i
use jelly up in the crease i used a mix
of peanut butter and spread the love yes
peanut butter and spread the love i put
up into the crease and then I deepen the
crease up with a little bit of peanut
butter cop and very happy very happy
it's a very nice palette highly
recommend so far i use it this morning
and then took my makeup off and then i
use it again lasting power was very good
for eyeliner i tried to use the wet and
wild fergie eyeliner with one of the
beauty junkies brushes and it was just
okay I think it might be drying out a
bit I might not be like the way that the
product was when it was fresh I honestly
don't remember it's been a really long
time since I've used it this is a cream
eyeliner in little black dress but it
didn't work for me today but that
doesn't mean that it's a bad product if
you've ever used this I'd love to hear
your thoughts on it down below
it was good for you when I was brand new
it's just at this point I think it's
pretty old so I think it might just be
drying out so I on top of it to kind of
make up for that i use the tart artist
clay paint liner in black this is
wonderful this is a really really really
nice liquid eyeliner well I guess it's
more of a gel eyeliner you have this
little tip on the top there that's
really easy to use you squeeze the
product out then you put your brush in
it and use it and it's a really really
nice Island only thing is it does flick
away if you do a wing I didn't do a wing
today we do a wing it will flake away
and then for mascara i use the l'oreal
double extent i really do like the red
one better than the blue one what it is
that it's got a primer on one side that
gives you some length and volume and
then you top it off with the other side
this blue side which is the actual
mascara and it's a very nice product but
definitely don't get the blue and get
the red one it's better I don't know
what the difference is formula wise but
red one better alright for brows today I
use the loreal brow stylist definer I've
talked about this a bunch of times it's
a wonderful product exact dupe for the
Anasazi brow Wiz except for in shade I
feel like this is darker than the dark
brown from honest asya but it's it's
wonderful product works great and it's
got this fully on the back give me a
little brushy brushy it's good stuff
it's very good stuff especially for 10
bucks and for my cheeks I just got this
brand-new from hautelook this is the in
stain blush by the bomb in the shade
houndstooth this is brand new for me I
use it today for the first time and then
I use it tonight for the second time
it's just a gorgeous gorgeous blush a
let me see I have some old lipstick
swatches there so not that that so
amazing and you need kind of a more
fluffy brush with this you don't want to
use a super dense brush you don't want
to use a super dense brush because it
will give you clown face so you want to
use kind of a lighter less that's brush
with these because they're kind of crazy
but laughing power in this is amazing
next up on my cheeks i use my burberry
earthy blush number seven in light glow
this is the contour powder it is so fab
it is my perfect contour shade this is a
smaller version of it i'm so glad that i
have it it smells really good it smells
like burberry perfume and it just smells
amazing it works amazing it's my perfect
contour shade and I absolutely love it
it's so amazing
lasting power is also really really work
it worth a purchase if you're looking
for a good high end contour and you're
my skin tone I don't know about other
skins I'll tell you about mine we're
lips today for lip liner I use the Lord
and Barry silhouette lip liner and
filler I just kind of popped that around
the outside it is a clear lip liner
which is what I'm most comfortable with
kind of keeps everything from bleeding i
actually put on my lipstick and I was
kind of a hot mess so I had to take it
off then I put this on the outside put
it back on and it was much easier to
deal with so this is a really nice
product if you happen to run across this
I really like it a lot especially if
you're not used to using lip liner it's
like mistake proof because it's clear
you can't mess it up you know you have
to worry about drawing a straight line
because it's totally clear and then for
lipstick today I used one of the
lipsticks that I made at the bite Beauty
lab bite Beauty has a lip lab in New
York City where you can mix your own
lipstick well they mix it for you tell
them what you want them to add and as
far as color wise and where you're going
and then they mix it for you so this was
the shade that I made and I absolutely
love it I don't wear the darker one as
much so where the later one but really
really like a lot so you can't purchase
this but bite Beauty lab definite Moss
if you're ever in New York City highly
recommend it is very pricey but if you
have the money to blow on a lipstick
definitely do it it's super fun for
highlight today I use the highlight part
of the CC radiance ombre bronzer and
it's just this part up here is what I
used as my highlight and it is pop and
girlfriend it is pop and I forgot how
awesome this thing is this is just a
really nice product it's kind of great
bronzer down at the bottom you can see
that it's got the overspray of the
highlight so you can get a little bit of
highlight if you go in the middle but oh
my oh just BAM and bam bam amazingness
absolutely just tell you quickly what's
on my nails i do i did get both of these
recently these i think i'm pretty sure i
got them both at nordstrom rack for
super cheap she wants to rock or
marshalls might have been Marshalls i
got them on two separate occasions this
is SES bell bottom blues and i have on
here this is a they're both one coat
polishes what what i would say this one
you probably pushing it
one thick coat I put two coats on
because I just felt better about it this
is formula x is legend a dollar fifty at
marshalls it was fantastic if I can't I
couldn't believe it and then i couldnt
believe I found this either the bell
bottom blues I think this was on a
different occasion I want to say it was
like 250 or something so definite total
wins from marshalls on that one about
one coat polish on this one it is
chipping now I've only had it on for a
day and it's chipping a little bit which
kind of stinks but you know for a dollar
fifty two dollars but you think from
these brands you'd have better and that
is with a top coat forth from such feet
I you seche vite top coat and base coat
was formula x is base coat so that's it
for once on my face this week I hope you
