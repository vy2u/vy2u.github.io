hello my friends welcome to what's on my
face where I tell you everything is on
my face and this week's episode of
what's up in makeup let's start where I
started which was face primer so her
face primer today I use the cover FX
illuminating primer this I've been using
since October on and off and this is an
illuminating primer just like it says it
does what it says it's going to do it's
going to give you that glow from within
kind of look but only if you use it with
a satin finish foundation if you use
this with a dewy foundation oh my
goodness girlfriend people gotta see you
glow from the moon like it you will look
shiny it's gonna look bad so don't use a
little luminous foundation make sure
you're using this with either a satin
finish or if you have oily skin maybe
even a matte finish foundation I might
give you that little extra touch of glow
that you may enjoy so definitely
recommend this it definitely makes my
makeup stay on longer and it is a more
of a moisturizer kind of feeling rather
than a silicone kind of feeling so if
you like that then you'll probably
really like this I would imagine this
would be best for people with normal to
dry skin rather than oily skin but all
these skin girls you may like it too I
don't know I have normal skin and I love
it so that's my opinion straight up how
I feel about that let's go ahead and
move on to my eye primer now this is one
that I I I did not like this product
when I first guy this is the kat von d
color correcting eyeshadow primer and
fair and my expectations for kat von d
products are very very very very high
because of her the quality for
eyeshadows quality of her old formula of
her blushes i just think that she can do
amazing things and I think she's an
amazing person so when i get a kat von d
product i expected to be wonderful now
when i first got this it went on very
very very very patchy and it was like
what is going on and then when I blended
it with my fingers it completely blended
away so i tried blending it with a
beauty sponge I tried blending it with a
brush and just nothing was making this
work now that I had this open for a week
or two I like it a lot better maybe it
was like a film on the outside of the
that was making it just not work very
well I do like a lot better but here's a
kicker illness it is not as opaque as
let's say Urban Decay's primer potion in
Eden or max paint pot in painterly or
soft ochre it's very translucent in its
fish so just be aware of that it does
make my eyeshadow stay on just a bit
longer but I don't think that it is
worth the $28 or whatever this cost
price tag is just way too much for
something that's not really that amazing
get our bday cakes primer potion and eat
in or get one of those Mac Paint Pots
those things are fabulous for foundation
today I use the product from Mira nesto
Mira NASA is an australian brand that
I've like some things from in the past
so I like to try things from them every
once in a while when they're on whole
look this is the flawless revolution
anti-aging three in one 24-hour skin
perfecting SPF 15 foundation now that's
out the sounds like Physicians Formula
name it's so long now one thing is just
the packaging overall now when they show
you the picture on the website of course
it doesn't look like this all mushy it
looks like this all beautiful right and
then there's a little note when you get
it it says you know probably mix some
you know in shipping so it's like why I
put this little glass here with this
thinking that it's going to be beautiful
and then see a hot mess that's like way
if you go into a restaurant you know how
to have those open kitchens and you just
seem mess everywhere it's like don't
have an open kitchen that if you're
gonna have mess everywhere I know I mean
it just I was disappointed in that I was
just a little weird as far as the actual
formula of this there's nothing
extraordinary about this it is a light
to medium coverage depending on how you
build it I haven't seen any of these
claims on here particularly for me it
says line smoothing know it says poor
reporter refining primer I don't really
have large pores so i can't speak to
that one and it also says sheer color
corrector it definitely did not color
correct any redness that i had i
actually had to do some redness hush up
touch ups at the very end of my getting
ready so this definitely did not work
with that I don't don't think this is
worth a full price price tag on this I'm
not even sure if it was worth the sale
price that I got on hautelook so you
know just kind of an okay products
so the idea for eyeshadow today I was
supposed to using the sweet peach valid
but I had a little problem like i did
get to ordered it the original launch on
to face calm i did end up getting
through before i went to work the data
that launched and i was very excited to
have gotten it but i was going so fast
accidentally had it shipped to my own
address that i lived at back in July so
I fixed that today they're going to set
ship me another one so I'm really
excited about that thumbs up for the
customer service over at to face they
really helped me out a lot with that so
I was like well what's next best to the
peach palette and trying that out let's
just use the original chocolate bar
palette so the chocolate bar palette
I've said before if I could make myself
into an eyeshadow palette it would be
the chocolate bar happen this is the
most me eyeshadow palette ever of course
it smells like chocolate everybody that
is heard of it knows that it smells like
chocolate it smells great and some of
the shades in here do not work for me
than what the biggest one that does not
work for me is this one here called
candied violet and just straight-up
Gray's out on me it's terrible it's a
terrible shade unless you want a gray
its deadly not purple but some of the
stand out shades hear from me are creme
brulee and marzipan those are two of my
favorites here oh I'm not holding up
high enough creme brulee and marzipan
are two of my standout favorites I also
really like champagne truffle amaretto
is great I mean there's a lot of really
wonderful shades in here the shades i
use today i used a hazelnut from here
over on my lid i use creme brulee from
here over this way on my lid i use
marzipan as a little bit of a highlight
over here i use milk chocolate oath in
the crease and then I used a truffle
fudge to deepen up the outer corner I
also use white chocolate to kind of
blend out my brow bone so that was how I
use this today but there is a big pop of
shimmer right there and I'm going to
tell you what that is that did not come
from the chocolate bar palette that came
from artist Couture by angel and this is
the diamond glow powder and conceited
what I did was I took this with a little
drip of Kiko mixing solution if you can
get your hands on the stuff the stuff is
amazing it's like Max fix+ but way way
way cheaper put a drip of this on your
brush put it in a mineral
shadow and it really makes it pop so
that pop of color right there is this
it's a wonderful wonderful eye shadow as
far as giving you that pop of glitter
this is supposed to be a highlighter I
do not use this as a highlighter it is
way too glowy for me it is it's sparkly
it straight up sparkly if I wore this
and to work my boss will look at me like
I was insane like what why do you
glitter on your face like are you a
fairy like what so I would recommend
this for people that go out clubbing for
people that have a lot of events should
go to where they need a glow people that
like to take pictures on Instagram
things like that but for the everyday
wear this is just very glittery unless
that's your thing girl friend imagine
thing goes speaking of eyes you may have
noticed I'm wearing false eyelashes
which I never where I was at target
today with my daughter and I I saw these
and I was like oh my goodness like I
needed to start I just suck it up try
some lashes they look so beautiful I'm
so many people I need to just suck it up
so I got on periscope my pair of loves
over there that my community over on
periscope helped me to do this I'm not a
beauty guru okay the parallels help me
put this together I would not look like
this if it weren't for them they tell me
where to blend they tell me how to put
on my lashes and it was a fight but we
did it together special shout-out to
Nikki 6543 on Instagram and also Nikki
six five four three at blogspot doc
blogspot com she was the major player
and helped me apply these but so many
people like I can't even list all of the
names of people that helped me to put
these lashes on I mean just thank you so
much to all of you for all your advice
so enough about the story about me
putting them on let me tell you what I
think of them it does come with a clash
glue and two lashes I'll show you what
they look like right there in the box
when they're actually in there this is
the more wild one the bigger lash I kind
of ruined the first one by clipping off
both sides and everybody was trying to
tell me not to do it but I wasn't
looking I was too busy cutting and I
ruined the one pair so now we've got the
big ones on but but yeah I mean they
were relatively easy to go on the lash
glue was not the best it def I had to
reapply them a couple times because the
inner corner was not sticking so just be
aware of that I think they were ten
bucks for the pair which is not too bad
for
drug drug store lashes it's not bad so
yeah if they call to you i would
recommend i'm sure i've been going with
the eyes i use the ico that's where I
draw on the line I do liquid eyeliner
this is a marker tip eyeliner it goes on
very black very smooth very opaque at
the wing though that wing though it rubs
off emotions it rubs off like it stays
on the lash line fine they say it's
waterproof I don't think that it's
waterproof because it doesn't take much
to rub it off I mean it's really pretty
easy to get off so just be aware of that
if you get that and then the mascara i
use underneath my lashes was to steal a
huge mascara really really like this
mascara it has kind of a better than sex
mascara hourglass shaped form to it the
formula is amazing it's so good i can't
believe i haven't heard more people
talking about this i think it's because
sila is just generally a brand that a
lot of people don't really talk about
but i really like this mascara i'm so in
love with drugstore mascaras it's hard
for a high-end mascara to impress me and
make me think that i may want to pay a
high end price and any mascara was going
to make me pay a high end price it was
going to be this one and I've tried a
lot of high-end mascaras but this one is
pretty stinkin also length volume no
flaking I mean it just it beats a lot of
my drugstore mascaras and that takes a
lot to do eyebrows today I use the it
cosmetics brow power Universal eyebrow
pencil it is a very nice brow pencil
goes on a little bit hard it's a little
hard it's not as creamy as let's say the
Anasazi eyebrow is or the loreal brow
definer but it works it's nice I like
that it has a split on the ends it is a
little thicker of a tip then the Anasazi
Brown is so be aware of that if I to
choose between the two I would pick the
Anasazi 01 / this one just because I
think it's a little easier to apply but
it's not a bad brow product it's just
not a great bra product moving on to
cheeks the blush that I used today was
the baked gelato vivid swirl blush in
papaya by laura geller if you can find
any of these laura geller swirly
products they're all all ones i've ever
tried or really really good the
highlighters the blushes they're super
super pigmented and they stay on all day
long they're just beautiful they're easy
to work with they build very
slee just a really nice nice product you
don't go straight to clown face and if
you do put a little too much it's really
easy to blend without blending the
product away it's just a really nice
formula i highly recommend it alright
the knicks cream highlight and contour
palette it's taken a little warming up
for me to like this product one thing to
keep in mind is that when you don't use
this the top layer will dry so you have
to kind of break through a layer of
dryness before you get to the workable
product underneath it's not hard to do
you just have to rub your finger a
little bit on it and you'll get to the
good product this product is a little
difficult to work with in then it takes
some blending like you have got to
especially with the contour like get
some elbow grease in there to blend out
the contour it takes a little while it
goes on very very thick and it just it
just takes some work the highlight is a
little less work you I use a small
stippling brush from ELF to apply this
and I really like that a lot I also use
today the this one here and this I use
as an under eye brightener and I like
the way that that looks so i'll show you
my cheek kind of so you can see the
highlight there you can see the
brightener here and you can see the
contour there and overall i really like
the look it's just taking me a while to
kind of get used to how this product
works but now after using it quite a bit
i actually really like it and then to
finish it all off i use the chart smooth
operator finishing powder this is a
really nice finishing powder it gave me
enough Matt to make me happy but left a
little bit of that dewy glow from the
primer that I really wanted so I really
like this it helps my makeup stay on a
lot longer and it just it's a nice
finishing powder it does exactly what a
finishing powder is supposed to do just
brings the whole look together
mattifying the face just a little bit
but I feel like it gave me like a nice
satin finish I really like this product
but it's off it's really really good i
don't know i don't i don't brag about
tart that often so when i say something
about tort you know it's good and then
the last thing i use was thanks to my
friend you send you over is sonya cuevas
on youtube she is my friend
that I went to the bite beauty lab in
New York City I went with her after
generation beauty and we had a blast
making our own lipstick so this is the
lipstick that I created having the
person behind the counter she mixed
everything for me and we went a little
this way a little that way trying to get
a color that I really liked and this is
the one we ended up with so this has no
name and this is not something you can
purchase but if you're ever at in New
York City and you have some money to
blow on a lipstick it really is a fun
experience I don't think I'll do it
again just because of the price tag of
it but it really is fun it is fun I was
glad I did it once but I don't think
I'll do it again just cuz it was
thinking these old formula though this
isn't the amuse-bouche line this is the
old formula so I haven't tried the
amuse-bouche line I'll let you know if I
try one what I think of that but I
haven't yet so that's it for what's in
