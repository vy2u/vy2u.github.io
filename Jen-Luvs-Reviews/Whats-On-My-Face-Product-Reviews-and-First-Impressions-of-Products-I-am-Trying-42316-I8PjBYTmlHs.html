face where I tell you everything that's
on my face in this week's episode of
what's up in makeup thank you so much
for joining me for this video live on my
channel typically this video is housed
on what's up in makeup calm every single
week i have this video about what i use
during the filming of the show so if
you're curious about what i'm wearing on
my face in any other episodes of what's
been makeup definitely check out what's
up in makeup calm for those videos but
once a month when we do our evening chat
at five p.m. eastern time which is
daytime for a lot of people but it's
evening for me ish evening ish for me
this video goes live on the channel to
give you something to do during our
typical 10 IM chat time so without
further ado let's go ahead and jump into
what's in my face we're gonna go ahead
and start what I started which was face
prime now the face primer I use today
was the oprah silicone primer jail now
this is a very deceiving name for this
primer it says silicone primer gel but
if you look at the ingredients the
number one ingredient is water and the
very last ingredient is silicone which
is very very strange to call it a
silicone Bremmer when it's really very
very little silicone now it looks like
silicone it's very strange the second
ingredient in this is ginkgo biloba and
then sorbitol and then echinacea the
next in green after that is sodium hilar
run 8 which it's like what what why
didn't they use one of those as the name
instead of silicon primer Joe when you
put this on it's very strange it looks
like a gel but then when you rub it in
it feels very wet and very cooling
almost a water kind of feeling as its
drying down it gives a little tiny bit
of a tackiness just as it's barely
drawing at like almost dry and then just
dries down to nothing it is very very
light it feels fantastic on the skin and
it really really helps my makeup to stay
on longer now this was sent to me by
over quite a long time ago but I did not
tell them I was going to review it they
said review it if you want to show i'm
reviewing it for you and I really really
like it a lot definitely recommend this
for foundation today i'm wearing the rim
obd cream Matt beauty balm 9 and 1 skin
perfecting super makeup and actually
really enjoying this product a lot I
don't hear a lot about it on youtube but
I'm really enjoying it it's a more
full coverage for a BB cream so you're
looking at like a light to medium
coverage it definitely mutes out all
discoloration like if I put it over top
of my lips you can no longer see my lip
color my natural lip color at all it
definitely kind of calms down my
freckles a little bit but you can't you
can still see my freckles through it so
that's kind of what we're looking for
where time when this is about four to
six hours before it starts fading which
is pretty good and I really do enjoy it
it's a nice product my shade that I am
using is the shade light me concealer
today I am using the Sephora gel
concealer in the shade parfait I was at
the vib rouge sale at my local Sephora
and my friend Gayle who is in all parts
of the community recommended that I pick
this up I had heard about this on
youtube quite a few times and I was like
oh yeah that sounds good so I grabbed it
I put it in my basket and I bought it
and I do not regret it it is really
really nice coverage is very good for my
dark circles really enjoying that I love
doing the whole highlighting of this V
section here it looks really really nice
and it has not been creasing on me
except for once now just don't make this
mistake if you accidentally put powder
under your eyes do not under any
circumstances put this on over top it is
a terrible terrible terrible idea
because what ends up happening is it
will accentuate every single line you
have and it will make it crack like it
just straight-up crackled it was so
horribly bad but if you put your powder
over top of it after this is set no
problems at all so just be aware of that
but overall huge win on the Sephora gel
concealer now for eye primer today I
want to tell you about it but then I
have a little story this is the l'oreal
magic decrease and this is a relatively
new product now i've been using this for
a good couple of weeks I got this with
my Ulta coupon it was kind of an impulse
buy with my old to coupon the twenty
percent off that my friend shannon q had
let me use her coupon she couldn't use
it in canada so she sent it to me that
was very nice of her thank you so much
Shannon for that it's almost like the
Urban Decay primer potion in Eden where
it mutes out discoloration but it's not
quite as good as Eden I really do feel
like Eden is
worth the investment over this but I had
tried the kat von d new eyeshadow primer
that supposed to mute outs coloration I
like this a lot better it definitely
does not the shadows do not crease on me
when i use it lasting power of the
shadows with it is definitely much
better than other drug store primers
that i have used it's definitely better
than the elf is definitely better than
the lorac one that i have used but this
is the thing today I had a little
debacle and I don't know if it was the
foundation the primer this or a
combination but when I put this on
something happen where it broke up on my
skin right here on the inner corner just
in the inner corner it got all crackly
and powdery and I had to use a wet
Beauty Blender ish thing to a beauty
sponge I had to use a wet beauty sponge
to kind of Pat out the product now I do
feel like it had to have been a
combination of something else going on
maybe the the gel primer here I don't
know but something because it wasn't all
over my lid it was just right here so I
have a feeling i brought the primer up
here as i was applying it and it didn't
mix well with it so if you're having
trouble with this i recommend making
sure you do not put it over top of any
other product just put it straight onto
your lids and see if that helps so
overall this is a big win for me i am
gonna play with it more before i give a
full review because i'm now I'm nervous
about this product it makes me kind of
go I need to test this a little bit for
eyebrows i use the YBF your best friend
eyebrow pencil now this is kind of the
classic brow pencil i think i remember
this came out i want to say even before
the honest on Zia one the roll-up pencil
I could be wrong on that but I want to
say that it's older than that one so
it's got the roll-up form just like the
Anasazi Dubrow is it is a harder formula
so you do have to kind of rub to get it
on there but this is what's what's great
about this this is called Universal
taupe so if you are a makeup artist this
may be one you want to invest in if you
do a very light stroke then you have a
nice shade for blonds if you do it a
little bit harder you get a more
brunette shade if you do it really hard
you end up with dark brown
like really cool how it builds like that
I absolutely love it it's so it's great
for being able to kind of change your
shade to a little more dramatic so if
you have lighter hair and sometimes you
like to make your brows darker this is a
great one to have because it's kind of
an all-in-one product in that way also
it's got the spoolie on the back which
of course is very nice Ajay always seem
to need always seemed unique okay for
eyeshadow today it was kind of a process
so let me take you through the process
of how I got this I looked because it
was kind of an experimental and it
didn't really go well so I turned a
different direction so I started off
using this Jake at Beauty triple crown
baked eyeshadow and Baked Alaska what I
was going for was a Prince Purple Rain
kind of look in tribute so I I know it's
like here someone passes away so I do an
eyeshadow look in tribute I know how
ridiculous that absolutely sounds but
that was what I chose to do judge me if
you will alright so we started off with
this silver shade this is an absolutely
beautiful beautiful silver shade it is
very opaque very long wearing it will
blend away if you're too rough with it
so you just have to be careful when
you're blending it that you don't blend
it away but these Jake at beauty trios
are really really nice i think there's
six dollars for a trio don't get the
blue one but other than the blue one
I've really had great luck with these
you can get these at Ulta calm very very
nice product so as I was doing that I
said okay now i need a crease color so
for my crease color i dipped into my
little black book of bronzers by to face
and I use the milk chocolate Soleil as
my crease color that went on absolutely
beautifully and then I said okay I need
to add some purple so i went into my
bare minerals this is called passionate
plum and it's one of their mineral eye
shadows and it was just too matt for the
look that i was going for but it is a
beautiful shadow so i do want to show it
to you especially if you want some
subtle color on your eyes this is an
excellent choice for people that are
looking to do a little bit of color but
don't want something really wild there
are a lot of people out there that want
to try some color but aren't sure how to
incorporate it this is a great shade to
start with I do have some old swatches I
apologize this here is how that looks
and it's just a beautiful matte purple
shade and it's not loud in any way it's
just it's a great great shade but
unfortunately for this look
wanted something a little more while so
where I reached for to get that wild
look was this shade right here this is
the buxom shade in la la lavish and let
me show you how beautiful this is and it
goes on the lid just like this you can
get a little bit more of a subtle tinge
to it if you apply it with a brush but I
popped it on my lid with my finger and
oh my gosh just absolutely gorgeous it
kind of reminds me of makeup geeks
duochrome in blacklight but this one is
so much more beautiful in my opinion I
love makeup geek but I really like the
shade better for that effect it's just
it's really really stinging beautiful
actually let's get black light so this
is black light by makeup geek and then
this is the buxom la la lavish and I
definitely I feel like just the makeup
geek falls a little short but you gotta
remember that the the buxom one is twice
the price as well so if you want a
cheaper dupe then the makeup geek one is
a cheaper dupe I don't feel like the
makeup geek one last nearly as long as
the buxom though just so you know but
they're very very very similar to finish
off the look i use my lorac Pro that my
sister-in-law Amy gave me and I use just
the black shade in the outer corner over
here and I did have to take two passes
on this for the black shade because I
felt like when I blended it it just it
didn't um it blended out too much so I
knew I wanted more of a punch of black
so I had to add more in just to give me
a little bit more of a smokey eye so
definitely the black be careful with it
as far as if you want a really black
black you might have to do a couple of
passes on it for this and that was I
look that's what we got going on right
now and then so let's go ahead and move
on to eyeliner or my eyeliner today is
the tart so fine liquid eyeliner and
this eyeliner is so fine in so many ways
and this is probably one of my favorite
tart products of all time this is a
wonderful wonderful eyeliner the way
that the pen it is a pen tip and the way
that it bends is just perfect it is so
tiny it is so fine if you are looking
for if you're not used to doing eyeliner
and you're looking for something to
start with for eyeliner I definitely
recommend this because it is so fine
you're going to get the tiniest tiniest
tiniest little
line you just want to keep it really
close to your lash line but it is so
easy to work with it's so black and so
fun to use and that the bends on it is
perfect just a wonderful eyeliner for
beginners and for people that are
experienced as well because it's just it
cuts out your time when something goes
on so easily and effortlessly it cuts
out the time that you need to invest in
your makeup application Rupert cheeks
today I am really loving makeup
revolution really loving it so glad
people in the community recommended I
think most of the facebook group really
recommended makeup revolution to me is
one of the big reasons why I bought so
much makeup revolution I have a couple
of our shadow palettes then I have a
blush I have a highlighter but this
blush is really really nice and for a
drugstore blush a lot of drugs for
blushes either a lack in pigmentation or
they have too much pigmentation and what
you really want Anna blush in my opinion
that is most useful is one that builds
so it starts off with a light
application but then you can get a
little more if you want you can get a
little more if you want to get a little
more if you want and that's how you can
get it to work on lots of different skin
tones as well that is exactly what this
blush does this one is in the shade
divine and it just builds so beautifully
it looks like a crazy crazy pink I know
that but look it is not crazy it does
not have to be crazy you just have to
put on a light application blend it out
and it's beautiful it is absolutely
beautiful I did put it on a little bit
extra because I was filming today but
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous blush and
fantastic formula it reminds me of my
tart blushes as far as the way that it
bill for contour i use the wet and wild
mega blow contouring palette in dulce de
leche now this contouring palette does
have a little bit of a warmer tone for
the contour but I feel like it works if
you have a cool skin tone you may not
like the shade I've heard that the other
one I forget what it's called but the
other one in this line is better for
cooler tone but i did use as my contour
today and I do like it I don't feel like
it's so warm that it has to be a bronzer
you can use it i think in my opinion for
either this is what i use to set my
under eyes actually ended up putting
this all over my entire face for a
deeper skin tone this would be really
nice nice as a highlight for someone
that is a lighter skin tone than me this
may be a little too dark for you as far
as highlight
it matches perfectly with my skin as far
as highlighting and a dusting of powder
i really like it a lot I know it looks
lighter than my skin tone when you dust
it all over it really leaves a nice
finish and I really enjoy it all or
highlight today my new love the honest
hacia glow kid and gleam oh my goodness
I am so in love with this I'm so in love
with you the reason why I love this
thing is because of the uniqueness of
some of these highlights especially hard
candy hard candy is so so stinking fun
it reminds me of you remember getting
those stickers when you were a kid that
when you looked at it one way it looks
one way and then you turned it and then
the picture would change that's exactly
what's happening here duochrome ish but
really dramatic duochrome for me so when
you look at it one way it looks kind of
brownish but then when you turn it it
turns pink like really dramatic
duochrome for me i'm really loving it a
lot i'm really loving it it's so fun and
you can see it on the cheek it's really
beautiful it's kind of loud if you don't
like allowed highlight this one's kind
of loud but then you've also got these
four and the Panzer huge they're
absolutely huge but I feel like the most
important thing I want to tell you about
this is the lasting power this will
seriously last me 12 hours on my cheeks
I am NOT even kidding when I put this on
my face at eight o'clock in the morning
I'm not kidding you by eight o'clock at
night I still have high later on like
you can still see it it is amazing it is
really really great I definitely
recommend investing in one of these if
you're looking for some fun highlights
if you like pop and highlights if you
like subtle highlights this is probably
not going to be for you but if you like
that glow that BAM this is what you got
this shade of the NYX liquid suede in
soft spoken in my Ipsy bag so I wanted
to use it again I've used it quite a few
times to kind of remember what it's like
because it's been a while since I've
used it now okay on its own this formula
dries down feels uncomfortable and then
flakes off for me personally I don't
enjoy the formula the initial
application is very pretty but it
doesn't feel good and then it doesn't
wear down very well so what I've been
doing is I've either been using my
Smashbox instant
that which is this one right here over
top to keep that matte finish but to
give me some hydration or I've been
topping it with something else and
that's what I chose to do today I wasn't
sure what I wanted to top it with but
one of the parallels I wish I knew who
it was recommended that I try unicorn
tears over top of it this is two-faced
unicorn tears it is the craziest most
fun lip product I have ever purchased in
my entire life i will put a link down
below to my review of this and how i've
tried this on different lipsticks it is
really fun on the lips by itself it
looks insane it looks absolutely insane
but over top of another product it looks
so cool that's what i'm wearing on my
lips today so let me show you i'm going
to do two swatches of soft spoke and 1
i'm going to put without unicorn tears
and the other one I'm going to put
unicorn tears on top let it dry down for
a second so there's my two swatches and
I'm going to put unicorn tears over top
of this one here so you can see what it
looks like and look how fun isn't that
fun it gives it like that true Prince
Purple Rain awesomeness isn't that neat
like it gives that little shift and I
love it I was so excited about this
lipstick again I will link the review
full review of unicorn tears down below
so you can see me play with it even more
decide whether you want to invest in it
but if you if this in any way looks
interesting to you I definitely
recommend trying it out it is so so
stinkin fun so that's it for what's in
