you
hello my friends welcome to what's on my
face where I'll tell you everything
that's on my face in this week's episode
of what's a bit makeup this video is
typically housed at what's of a makeup
calm but once a month it is house on my
youtube channel so this is the time that
it's housed here because I do what my
youtube a chat at this time but to
accommodate a lot of different people
who can't join us on sunday mornings i
change the chat time at the very last
sunday of the month to a later time so
today it will be at five p.m. eastern
time and instead you're getting this
lovely video to keep you busy until chat
this evening so i'm gonna go ahead and
start where i started which was face
prime face primer today is a product
that I'm kind of trying to use up I do
like it it is the spackle tinted under
makeup primer in ethereal by laura
geller this is a really nice base primer
i do think that increases the longevity
of my makeup just a tad but honestly
like lately I've been kind of
questioning face primers in general and
how effective they truly are I feel like
I primers are definitely effective but
as far as face primers I feel like I
need to look into this more that I've
been assuming that they've been doing
things where I'm not a hundred percent
sure so I'm going to be looking into
more about face primers and whether
they're actually worth the investment
this one in particular does give a
little bit of a glow if you have a
lighter coverage foundation if you have
a fuller coverage foundation that's
probably the glow is probably going to
be pretty much covered up ethereal yes
but only under a lighter coverage
foundation it is a lotion II kind of
formula it's not a silicone II kind of
formula and it feels nice to go on the
skin I do enjoy this primer I don't know
if it's a hundred percent necessary but
I do enjoy it for foundation today I
used to narrow narrow today for
foundation I use to nick's mineral
foundation sticks this one is in light
medium this one is in cool tan and I
kind of mix these together to get my
skin tone and overall I do like them i
feel like the lasting power is pretty
good they last me through a good school
day work day kind of time about six to
eight hours but i kind of toward that
seven eight hour mark they start fading
a bit also
the coverage is not fantastic on these
you really have to build them up and
when you do build them up they kind of
get to cake face so I kind of have mixed
feelings about these they are kind of
fun to use because they are in the stick
form and I like them enough but I
probably would not purchase these and I
probably wouldn't recommend purchasing
them just because I don't think that
they're something that's great they're
fine but they're definitely not because
I use those to beef it up a little bit i
used my mary kay mineral powder
foundation in ivory too i like to have a
mineral foundation or a powder
foundation as a backup so just in case i
don't have a quite enough coverage and
whatever foundation or BB cream I use
and I want to beef it up just a little
bit this is a nice thing just to have in
your drawer just in case and this is a
nice one I really like the coverage on
this you can get it up to almost a
medium coverage it is pretty light on
its own but put over top of a BB cream
or tinted moisturizer it gives a really
nice finish had this for quite a while
but I really do still enjoy it concealer
today which I did apply before the
powder foundation you always want to put
your liquids on before the powders or
else crazy things can happen I use the
the naked skin weightless complete
coverage concealer by urban decay this
is in the shade fair neutral it is way
too light for me and I will tell you
that I used a big foundation a blending
kind of brush with it initially today
just to try something different and it
blended it out way too much I definitely
recommend a smaller brush or your
fingertips to blend out this product
because I feel like it doesn't really do
it justice if you blend it out too much
you really have to kind of Pat it into
the skin to really get that concealing
effect so if the concealers aren't
really working on you you might be over
blending them like I did today so
definitely tapping it into the skin or
patting it in with a very small brush
not very small but you know a smaller
brush than a face brush is the way that
I prefer to use this it's a nice
concealer I do I think that it's way
better than anything else I've ever used
no definitely not but I mean I hate to
give it a negative review but I really
don't find this to be anything special
but that might be because number one I
don't have super bad dark circles and
number two it's too light of a shade for
me so maybe if I had the right
shade or if I had more discoloration
problems I would respect this product a
little more but for me it's just kind of
an okay prod I shadow primer today I use
the julep blank canvas mattifying I
primer I've had some bad issues with
this where I feel like it doesn't really
do what it's supposed to do as far as
the lasting power what it does do is it
will mute out discolorations it's kind
of like Urban Decay's primer potion and
Eden where it commutes out the
discoloration so that you can get more
of a blank canvas on your eyes before
you apply your eyeshadow and it
definitely does that I don't think that
it really makes my eyeshadow stay on
longer but it does give a nice blank
canvas so it's really what you're
looking for in a primer personally I
would recommend max paint pot and
painterly or Urban Decay's primer potion
and Eden instead of this one that's just
my personal opinion it's not bad it's
just not great again we have a lot of
those this week for brows today I use
this sample of the milk makeup gel brow
milk makeup is a brand new brand to
sephora i got this in my very first two
for a play box there was an issue where
I didn't get the second so for a play
box the one for this month so I don't
know what I'm going to do as far as
reviewing that I'm kind of a mess with
it right now because I didn't get maze
box so there won't be a review this
month and the next month I'm going to be
on vacation so there won't be a review
next month but eventually i'd like to
start reviewing sephora play I'm just
going to review this product for you
this brow color is very nice it's very
opaque it is a little bit light for me
but when I press down harder I feel like
it gets a little bit darker and it's
workable I mean I like the way that it
looks at my brows my big complaint about
this is it's very very very waxy very
waxy and I don't enjoy that it feels
very heavy on the brow at this point I
don't really feel it anymore but for a
very long time after I put this on I've
been wearing this for about three hours
at this point and i like the effect of
it i just don't like the way it feels
for that first couple of hours our to
where it just feels heavy and thick and
i would definitely not purchase this
just because i don't like that feeling
at all i would definitely recommend
getting the loreal brow stylist definer
it's ten bucks so much cheaper and so
much better than
product in my personal opinion this look
I kind of put a lot of mish-mosh eNOS
into my look but you might be able to
find these colors in your collections so
i figured i would show you what i used i
started off with the Too Faced chocolate
bon bons palette and I use this color in
pecan praline as my crease color it's
just kind of a topi brown then I went
into this kind of medium to light ash
pink color by urban decay it's called
scratch I got this in one of those 24
favorites kits it's the one that was
like the pink one I really like this it
is a satin finish so I use this all from
here from like three quarters of the way
in all the way out to the outer corner
then after that I was like well I was
talking to my friends on periscope and
they were like let's do pink and silver
with a pop of greens like Cass so I
pulled out this shade this is called
couche and it's by color pop now I don't
use my color pop shadows very often
because I find them difficult to work
with I just feel like even my pinky
finger is just too big I like to use a
brush and these just don't work well
with the brushes that I personally have
and I just I'm just not the biggest fan
of color pop I shadow fish is the
application I don't enjoy it's too much
work for me personally they feel really
neat though they're kind of sushi they
feel it just very soft and they break
pigmentation so I pop this on the inner
corner of my lid and I was like oh
because the shimmer eNOS the metallic
pneus of this was too overpowering for
this pink shade so I had to kind of beef
up the pink shade this is a highlighter
it's by a brand called artist couture
and it is the diamond glow powder in yes
and this is designed by a youtuber his
name is angel and I don't want to
butcher his last name but I end up using
this kind of as a multitasking product
so after I did the pink all over I put
the color pop eyeshadow and couche from
here over to the inner corner of my lid
and then I popped this one this is has a
little bit of a pink shimmer to it what
lot of pink shimmer but it's very light
pink I popped that all over my lid now
that lightened it up quite a bit so then
i layered this back over top of the
highlighter and that worked really
really well to bring that pink back into
the look though i really like the way
that that came out with the help of my
friends on periscope what i decided to
use in the outer core
it was bless her heart from the peach
palate it's that deep all of the green
shade it doesn't really look green here
like it all like I'm looking at it and
it's kind of grayed out a bit I don't
care it's got a little bit of a green
tinge to it which is kind of nice i
really like it but it's not like a pop
and green it didn't show up super green
but i do love it's like a nice mossy
mossy color it's very nice and then for
my brow bone I use peaches and cream
just to kind of bring it all together on
the brow bone just a nice matte brow
bone shade and then that is it for that
part of my eye look for the eye shadow
part so let's move on to eyeliner for
eyeliner on my upper lash line i use the
Jessie's Girl liquid liner in brown you
can't really see that a whole lot in
this look which is totally fine with me
it was just kind of to line my lash line
to get it ready for the false lashes if
I wasn't going to wear false lashes this
actually looked really really pretty
before the lashes went on so I would
wear this again with this look it looked
really nice to balance out the look and
then up through the lashes on just kind
of ruin the brown but I definitely would
come out a brown liner with this look
okay so what is on my lower lash line is
what's really poppin that I feel like
really makes this look unique is the
Sephora eyeliner pencil this is the
waterproof version and Capri Anya
dreamin I'm hoping I'm saying that right
it's Portuguese i don't know i don't
think i've ever said a portuguese word
on my channel so i'm really hoping i did
that right but anyway it is a very
bright bold green liner and again i have
been wearing this look for a couple of
hours now and it has not moved and i
really really like these sephora liners
if you ever see these in a set and you
like the colors i definitely recommend
them they stay on my waterline very
nicely and i never hear anybody talk
about them and they're super super super
nice i also through that Jessie's Girl a
little bit down on the lower lash line
this doesn't really do great for the
lower lash line but I stuck it right on
the lashes instead of trying to stick it
in my waterline and it really worked
very nicely so this pairing was pretty
good pretty good really just today I'm
going to insert the picture right here
of the inky making lashes that I use
these are by Sabrina who is another
youtuber I love to support youtubers
this one is in the design or the style
called white lie and
Sabrina's lashes they last really well I
think this is maybe the fifth time I've
used this pair of lashes I've used it
quite a bit they still look the same as
they did when they came out of the box
they haven't worn down at all they
haven't gotten goopy or gloppy or
anything I really like them a lot i'm
really enjoying her lashes definitely
recommend moving on to my cheeks I use
this blush this is an essence blush in
the shade heatwave I kind of stuck to
the this side right here the pinky or
side and I really like this blush a lot
I want to get more of these I don't know
how many more shades they make in this
but this is the shade number 10 I so I'm
hoping there's more of these because I
would really really like to buy more I
did get this last year i think at
generation beauty in the swag bag i'm
pretty sure and i'm just absolutely
loving it and i love the ombre effect
number one it's really beautiful and
number two you truly get two completely
different shades in this blush which is
really a contour i broke into my Kevin a
quan contour book but this shade is sold
individually this one right here the
sculpting powder it's in the shade
medium this one is sold as an individual
and it's kind of my perfect contour I
really love this shade for contouring
it's just a beautiful cool tone which is
what I personally prefer and I really
love the shadows in here but the candle
light powder isn't great like for me
because I would like a super pop at
highlight but if you like a more subtle
highlight something more along the lines
of hourglass you'll probably really like
the candle light powder I'm not as big
of a fan of the cream products in here i
have used them but i prefer the powder
products so for me the big wins on in
this particular palette is the sculpting
powder and then the eyeshadows but i
don't think you can get this anymore
I've heard of people finding it on
discount here and there so if you do see
this somewhere it's definitely a
recommend from me overall I VI really I
love this palette it's very fun to use
even if just I'm just using the powder
products I still really really like this
one finally we're going to do lips and
nails for lips I am wearing as i
recommend from the community over on
periscope and i'm so sorry i can't
remember who the name of the person
recommended it i can't i'm like terrible
with it so i sincerely apologize that i
can't remember if i can get it off a
periscope on the replay baby that's what
i'll do i'll put the person's name right
here so thank you so much for the
recommendation this is so
lo a bicolor pop I really like this one
a lot it's a little more subtle than
what I really want to do today we tried
on a bunch of bright shades and it
didn't really work so this one worked
out pretty well and then what I did was
I took the highlighter and yes and I
just popped it in the center kind of my
mom um that out and that's how I got my
lip look for today and I think I came
out good i think i really like it a lot
it's better than I thought it was going
to be when I was like solo that's so
boring but adding that highlight that
sparkle in there really really helped a
lot and I also use the gas for my
highlight today that i forgot to mention
i use that as a highlight it's a very
glittery glittery glittery highlight
though so just be prepared if you buy
those artists couture highlights that
they are super super super glittery
they're not shimmery their glitter so
just be forewarned be forewarned and
then for nails today I'm using the julep
polish in Seoul a julep is my favorite
nail polish brand I have to say they are
the most consistently awesome brand over
as well over se because a see I feel
like is very inconsistent Zawya you know
I have lots of different polishes if you
guys have seen my polish wall I have so
many different brands I have orally you
know I have an arse polish i have 0 p
eyes i have all these different brands
but julep by far as my favorite I know
that they are smaller than the typical
polish but for me the way that I buy
them I feel like it's worth it if you
get their mystery boxes that's a great
way to get a bunch of jewel polishes if
your julep maven that's another great
way to be to get a lot of jolt polishes
for less than the full price I would not
pay fourteen dollars for a nail polish
and I have not bought any julep polishes
at full price I've gone through their
different systems to get them so I
definitely feel like they're worth a
discounted price I would pay at most ten
dollars for one of these but I'd have to
really really love it I prefer to go to
$68 root on any nail polish after that
it gets gone crazy that's why I love the
mystery boxes in the julep maven program
in order to get more of these so that's
it for what's on my face and what's on
my nails I hope you enjoyed this video
