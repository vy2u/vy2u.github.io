back with our regular season next week
but for now I am Jen from Genlis reviews
and welcome to what's up and makeup
rewind welcome welcome we are back let's
get started with the rewind this week
we're going to be telling you the most
important most interesting things that
happened over the last three weeks that
starts with a story we left you with a
few weeks ago about Revlon Revlon had
acquired Elizabeth Arden in a
multi-million dollar deal and she sado
had bought Laura Mercier now recently
another huge deal L'Oreal has acquired
it cause medics Jamie Kern Lima will
stay on as CEO and promises that
everything will be as it was and the
brand will remain cruelty-free they also
introduced the superhero I transforming
anti-aging super palette so it seems the
names are getting a little longer as
well and now we have word that castanea
partners and main post partners are
teaming up to buy becca cosmetics the
sale is expected to finalize mid-august
CEO Robert De Baker will remain sources
say so we might still see some
collaborations with Jacqueline hill on
that champagne collection in
august-september we say goodbye to
drugstore com and unicom walgreens is
shutting down the sights in favor of a
new and improved Wolverines calm to face
Jerrod Blandino posed with kat von d to
showcase the hashtags hashtag better
together and hash tag coming soon to
sephora but we still don't know exactly
what in the meantime to face introduced
packaging for a new sweet peach
highlight palette but just the outside
and they also revealed the power of
makeup palette by Nikki tutorials and in
really neat app news a company called
match Co has created an app which uses
selected points of light on your body
your forehead your wrist etc to get a
real read on your skin tone then blend
the foundation specifically for you even
your name is printed on the bottle
primer moisturizer and color all in one
no two bottles are alike the buzz is big
on this product right now what is only
available for iOS and is available in
the App Store did you get the new
kathleenlights collaboration collection
with colour-pop cosmetics well it was
available on July twelfth the collab
includes pen and pot eyeliners as well
as ultra satin lip sticks by the way the
12th was also the same day that color
pop started shipping internationally
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble has a new beauty
department called the glossary but what
is it it's a section of local college
bookstores which stock beauty products
concept stores have opened at five
colleges as a special section of the
campus bookstore brands included are
lipstick queen butter london philosophy
smashbox Burt's Bees covergirl
Maybelline and more you might ask
yourself why are they doing this well
apparently schools that have this
department in their bookstore are far
from local moles and difficult to get to
but with online shopping who would need
to cover girls Instagram now has a very
special ability you can shop directly
from their feed see a color you like
click and go easy breezy you know the
rest speaking of covergirl did you know
that hard candy is suing covergirl well
more precisely their parent company
Procter &amp;amp; Gamble this photo is why can
you see what the problem is according to
legal documentation obtained by TMZ hard
candy says it's had trademarks for
10-plus years and the Katy line is
infringing now can you see it while the
lawsuit doesn't specify all signs point
to the heart in the middle of the brand
name hard candy wants the collection
removed from stores and is asking for
part of the profits so in the future be
careful what you put your heart on this
just in something very strange is
happening with NYC cosmetics though
their website is still up there
Instagram their Twitter their YouTube
and even their Pinterest have seemed to
disappear what is going on we will keep
you posted let's close this section with
a happy thought once a year there is a
nerd from called comic-con and this year
