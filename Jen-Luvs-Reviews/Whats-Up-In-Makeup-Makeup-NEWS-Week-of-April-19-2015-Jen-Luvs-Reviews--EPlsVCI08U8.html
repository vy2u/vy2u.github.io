lowes reviews and you are watching
what's up in makeup welcome back from
our small hiatus while I was it imats in
new york city i had a blast but now
what's up and makeup is back whoa let's
get into the new stuff this week Urban
Decay's summer collection came out this
week including revolution hi color
glosses there are 82 shades and Urban
Decay says they feel and look amazing on
your lips they have a pigment infusion
system that gives the formula it's super
creamy texture insane pigmentation and
superior color dispersion now this is
the part that gets me I don't even know
how to pronounce this because they made
up a crazy word it's also laced with
hiller lip here lip mmm which defines
and hydrates lips while making them look
plumper and fuller let's go with it next
up the afterglow eight-hour powder
blushes they are twenty-six dollars each
there are eight shades including a few
shades that look like they might be able
to be pulled off as bronzers they are
light diffusing pigments to enhance and
perfect the skin next up the ultimate
ozone which makes me want to look for
turbo anybody ever seen break into
electric boogaloo back in the 80s that
was one of my favorites but anyway this
is the ultimate ozone multi-purpose
primer pencil and they call it the
double stick tape of the beauty world
they are so creative there it holds lip
color in place prevents feathering
correct mistakes and even fills in fine
lines very creative hopefully it works I
am very curious to see the reviews on
that one alright next we've got the
eyeshadow primer potion there's three
new shades in Eden minor sin and enigma
i think in Nathan's been enigmas been
out for a hot minute that was actually
currently sold out on the urban decay
website but I think you might still be
able to get it on the Sephora auto
websites they're twenty dollars each
enigma is a limited edition
neutral eyeshadow primer that funds the
ultraviolet edge which is Urban Decay's
global initiative to empower women next
up tart is celebrating their 17th
birthday with an exclusive set you get a
full-size better than sex mascara the
natural eyes palette a soul mates blush
and bronzer and a makeup bag for $65 you
got to go to the tart website to find it
you click on their little link and it
will tell you to add all of the products
to your cart and then you put in a code
that they give you and then you get it
all for $65 finally in big big big news
the Anasazi of Beverly Hills artist
palette came out this week it is thirty
dollars there are 12 shadows from
velvety to matt too shimmery it's
available at sephora ohtsu and Anastasio
Beverly Hills calm specifically in
Sephora news we've got a lot of stuff
this week the Sephora favorites lash
stash to go there is a new one that just
came out in $25 if you've never gotten
one of those before they're pretty
amazing for trying high-end mascaras you

the blank ink amplified mascara make up
for ever has the artist plexi glosses
finally on sale at the support website
they're only available right now to vib
and vib rouge members there are 35
shades from transparent to black makeup
forever says they offer vivid color a
stunning shine in a non sticky formula
the tip is a super loaded split tip that
has a unique contour to sweep on the
ideal amount of lip lacquer I wonder if
that little cut is necessary or gimmicky
I'm very curious to know Marc Jacobs
beauty also came out with a enamored
high shine lip lacquers in 18 shades
they offer a mint scent across that is
high shine and has lasting brilliance in
Foundation news Lancome came out with
the miracle cushion liquid cushion
compact foundation it's listed right now
as
coming soon at least as of the filming
of this video it's 4650 and it comes in
11 shades Lancome says that it is a
color true liquid foundation and a
unique cushion sponge that seamlessly
delivers light to heavy coverage while
hydrating the skin it has the benefits
of a BB and CC cream to achieve a light
medium coverage so I'm a little bit
confused on the contradictory language
there is a light medium is it like a
heavy what's going on here one thing to
note is it is 0 point five ounces of
product versus the typical 1 ounce of
foundation product in this there is a
tutorial on so forest website by Lisa
Eldridge and she says a couple of things
about it she describes its cooling on
the skin she applies a thin layer in
some places and the thicker layer in
other places but she also notes that it
is especially good for travel Sephora
has a few new brands on their website
including a Korean brand called touch in
Seoul there are quite a few products
from that brand but a couple of my
wanted to mention first one is the feel
like honeymoon skin base its twenty four
dollars and it is cruelty free it's a
honey and collagen based rejuvenating
skin primer that supports smoother skin
for a flawless makeup application next
up is the Technicolor lip and cheek tint
for $22 it comes in six shades it's a
versatile cream to powder matte lip and
cheek tint with a long-lasting rich
mousse texture and then the last one I
wanted to mention is the style neon
super proof gel liner their twenty-six
dollars each and they have come in five
shades the next brand that I noticed
that I hadn't recognized before is Brett
Freedman beauty and they have the Brett
brow products the first one is the arch
control gel which is a cruelty-free
clear brow gel with a dry brush blender
so you get product on one side and then
the other side is just to blend it in
and then also the Jewish a pencil and
five shades a final new company that I'd
never seen before is eco brow that has
in defining wax it's a mineral base wax
that comes in four shades something was
going on in mascara land in the makeup
world this week there are so many
mascara kits on so forest website right
now there
like five or six of them but I just
wanted to mention a couple that stood
out to me the first one is the Lancome
grandiose mascara set it's $32 and it
has the grandiose mascara and the TSILS
booster XL lash perhaps one I wanted to
mention is the lashes to the extreme by
Clinique it's 1950 you get a full-size
high impact extreme volume mascara and
extreme black a full-size cream shape or
eyeliner in black diamonds and it's a
luck sample of the take the day off
makeup remover for lids lashes and lips
two more of those mascara sets tart came
out with one called the lights camera
action lash duet it comes with a
full-sized lights camera lashes for in
one mascara and a deluxe sample of the
lights camera splashes waterproof
mascara and then finally the Too Faced
set is called twice the drama it's $23
it comes with a full size better than
sex mascara and a deluxe perfect eyes
waterproof eyeliner in black the final
step that I wanted to mention at Sephora
is the YSL signature lip trio which
looks amazing it's $58 and it comes with
a full size glossy stain a limited
edition glossy stain and also a sample
of the rouge pur couture in LaRouche
finally for Sephora one more thing but
it's nail polish land nails it came out
with a really cool looking formula of
glitter not glitter but like flaking
nail polish it's called lux boho and
they call it a soft creamy blend of nail
shades for getting a wearable bohemian
inspired look and they say that has
opacity and two coats and QVC news this
week Laura Geller has a watercolor
illuminating gel with brush for
twenty-six dollars plus the three
dollars shipping and handling you get a
choice of two colors in sea shell which
is a soft pink shade with a shimmer and
Sunkist which is a bronze shade with
shimmer and it comes with an application
brush and just one more thing for QVC
the bare minerals prep step mineral
shield SPF 50 daily prep lotion it's
about thirty dollars and the description
says this unique skin protecting prep is
formulated with skin conditioners to
leave skin feeling soft and smooth the
lightweight lotion feels like a
nourishing skincare product unique micro
encapsulated pigments transform the
white
silky lotion into a lightweight makeup
base that blends beautifully with your
skin tone and dries to an invisible
finish so there you go and let's move on
to the drugstore all right we've got
L'Oreal who came out with the collection

selection of nine shades of red to go
with all of their beautiful actresses of
many different skin tones they can be
found in the Mother's Day section of the

each nail polish to match each of the
lipstick shades Maybelline's come out
with some really cute limit edition

color shadow palette they are seventeen
dollars each and for now they're only on
the next website there are three
different palettes in art throbs to reel
my heart and nuvo chic and I can
actually show you one other thing that
was in that because my friend Kirby's
Miranda actually gave me something out
of her bag this is the go-to palette in
dispensable and it has six shades and
then there is a blush a bronzer and a
highlight I'm wearing the shades today
and I absolutely love the shadows that I
worked with today they were super easy
to work with I am really excited about
these I can tell you that the bronzer is
not fun to work with it's not easy to
use I am enjoying the blush but I can
see a little hard pan developing so I'm
a little nervous about that I'm a little
disappointed that these shades are so so
similar I would have loved to have had a
matte shade here for this light color
overall really really loving this this
is not out yet but I am assuming we will
be seeing this in coming weeks how's
that for a little mini review in all the
