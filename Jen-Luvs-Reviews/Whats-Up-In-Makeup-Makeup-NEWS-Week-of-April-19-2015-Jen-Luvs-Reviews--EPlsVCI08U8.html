hello my friends this is Jed from Jed
loves reviews and you are watching
what's up in makeup welcome back from
our small hiatus while I was at IMATS
in New York City I had a blast but now
what's up and makeup is back whoa let's
get into the new stuff this week Urban
Decay's summer collection came out this
week including revolution hi color
glosses there are eight shades and Urban
Decay says they feel and look amazing on
your lips they have a pigment infusion
system that gives the formula it's super
creamy texture insane pigmentation and
superior color dispersion now this is
the part that gets me out even know how
to pronounce this because they made up a
crazy word it's also laced with Hillier
lip lip which defines and hydrates lips
while making them look plumper and
fuller let's go with it
next up the afterglow 8 our powder
blushes they are $26 each there are
eight shades including a few shades that
look like they might be able to be
pulled off as bronzers they are light
diffusing pigments to enhance and
perfect the skin next up the ultimate
ozone which makes me want to look for
turbo anybody ever seen a break into
electric boogaloo back in the 80s that
was one of my favorites but anyway this
is the ultimate ozone multi-purpose
primer pencil and they call it the
double stick tape of the beauty world
they are so creative there
it holds lip color in place prevents
feathering corrects mistakes and even
fills in fine lines very creative
hopefully it works I am very curious to
see the reviews on that one alright next
we've got the eyeshadow primer potion
there's three new shades in Eden
minor sin and enigma I think in Nathan's
Ben enigma has been out for a hot minute
and that was actually currently sold out
on the Urban Decay website but I think
you might still be able to get it on the
Sephora Ulta websites they're $20 each
enigma is a limited edition neutral
eyeshadow primer that funds the ultra
edge which is Urban Decay's global
initiative to empower women
next up TARDIS celebrating their 17th
birthday with an exclusive sets you get
a full-size better than sex mascara the
natural eyes palette a soulmates blush
and bronzer and a makeup bag for $65 you
got to go to the Tarte website to find
it you click on their little link and it
will tell you to add all of the products
to your cart and then you put in a code
that they give you and then you get it
all for $65 finally in big big big news
the honesty of Beverly Hills artist
palette came out this week it is $30
there are 12 shadows from velvety to
matte to shimmery it's available at
Sephora Ulta and Anastasio Beverly Hills
calm specifically in Sephora news we've
got a lot of stuff this week the sephora
favorites a lash stash to go there is a
new one that just came out in $25 if
you've never gotten one of those before
they're pretty amazing for trying
high-end mascaras you get five deluxe
sized samples and a voucher for a full
sized mascara whichever one is your
favorite of the 5 in the set you get the
Josie Maran Argan black oil mascara the
Lancome Paris Hypnose drama mascara the
Tarte lights camera flashes the Too
Faced better than sex mascara and then
finally the blank ink amplified mascara
makeup forever has the artist plexi
glosses finally on sale at the Sephora
website they're only available right now
to the IB and the IB Rouge members there
are 35 shades from transparent to back
makeup Forever's says they offer vivid
color a stunning shine in a non sticky
formula the tip is a super loaded split
tip that has a unique contour to sweep
on the ideal amount of lip lacquer I
wonder if that little cut is necessary
or gimmicky I'm very curious to know
Marc Jacobs beauty also came out with a
enamoured high shine lip lacquers in 18
shades they offer a mint scent across
that is high shine and has lasting
brilliance in foundation news Lancome
came out with the miracle cushion liquid
cushion compact foundation it's listed
right now as coming soon at least as of
the filming of this
yo it's 46 50 and it comes in 11 shades
Lancome says that it is a color true
liquid foundation and a unique cushion
sponge that seamlessly delivers light to
heavy coverage while hydrating the skin
it has the benefits of a BB and CC cream
to achieve a light/medium coverage so
I'm a little bit confused on the
contradictory language there is it light
medium is it like too heavy what's going
on here one thing to note is it is 0.5
ounces of product versus the typical one
ounce of foundation product in this
there is a tutorial on sephora's website
by Lisa Eldridge and she says a couple
of things about it she describes its
cooling on the skin she applies a thin
layer in some places and the thicker
layer in other places but she also notes
that it is especially good for travel
Sephora has a few new brands on their
website including a Korean brand called
touch in Seoul there are quite a few
products from that brand but a couple of
them I wanted to mention first one is
the feel like honeymoon skin base it's
$24 and it is cruelty free it's a honey
and collagen based rejuvenating skin
primer that supports smoother skin for a
flawless makeup application next up is
the Technicolor lip and cheek tint for
$22 it comes in six shades it's a
versatile cream to powder matte lip and
cheek tint with a long-lasting rich
mousse texture and then the last one I
wanted to mention is the style neon
super proof gel liner they're $26 each
and they have come in five shades the
next brand that I noticed that I hadn't
recognized before is Brett Freedman
beauty and they have the Brett brow
products the first one is the arch
control gel which is a cruelty free
clear brow gel with a dry brush blender
so you get product on one side and then
the other side is just to blend it in
and then also the duo SH a pencil and
five shades a final new company that I'd
never seen before is eco brow that has a
defining wax it's a mineral base wax
that comes in four shades something was
going on in mascara land in the makeup
world this week there are so many
mascara kits on Sephora's website right
now there's like five or six of them but
I just wanted to mention
couple that stood out to me the first
one is the Lancome grandiose mascara set
it's $32 and it has the grandiose
mascara and the SILS booster XL lash
perhaps what I wanted to mention is the
lashes to the extreme by Clinique
it's 1950 you get a full-size
high-impact extreme volume mascara and
extreme black a full-size cream shape or
eyeliner in black diamonds and a deluxe
sample of the take the day off makeup
remover for lids lashes and lips two
more of those mascara sets tarte came
out with one called the lights camera
action lash duet it comes with a
full-size lights camera lashes four in
one mascara and a deluxe sample of the
lights cameras splashes waterproof
mascara and then finally the two-faced
set is called twice the drama it's $23
it comes with a full-size better than
sex mascara and a deluxe perfect eyes
waterproof eyeliner in black the final
step that i wanted to mention in sephora
is the YSL signature lip trio which
looks amazing
it's $58 and it comes with a full-size
glossy stain a limited edition glossy
stain and also a sample of the Rouge pur
Couture in love Rouge finally for
Sephora one more thing but it's nail
polish land nails it came out with a
really cool looking formula of glitter
not glitter but like flaking nail polish
it's called luxe boho and they call it a
soft creamy blend of nail shades for
getting a wearable bohemian inspired
look and they say that has opacity and
two coats and QVC news this week Laura
Geller has a watercolor illuminating gel
with brush for $26 plus the $3 shipping
and handling you get a choice of two
colors in seashell which is a soft pink
shade with a shimmer and Sunkist which
is a bronze shade with shimmer and it
comes with an application brush and just
one more thing for QVC the bare minerals
prep step mineral shield SPF 50 daily
prep lotion it's about 30 dollars and
the description says this unique skin
protecting prep is formulated with skin
conditioners to leave skin feeling soft
and smooth the lightweight lotion feels
like a nourishing skin care product
unique micro encapsulated pigments
transformed the white silky lotion into
a lightweight
make up base that blends beautifully
with your skin tone and dries to an
invisible finish so there you go and
let's move on to the drugstore all right
we've got L'Oreal who came out with the
collection of private red lipstick and
there's a selection of nine shades of
red to go with all of their beautiful
actresses of many different skin tones
they can be found in the Mother's Day
section of the display in Walgreens
there's one additional shade called
because you're worth it red which I
thought was very cute they're rubberized
lipstick tubes with a gold autograph for
each of the women that the shade
represents and the sleigh also features
a shade of color riche nail polish to
match each of the lipstick shades
Maybelline has come out with some really
cute limited edition packaging to go

the New York skyline on all of the
packaging it's really cute some products
that have this new packaging are the

just repackaged and then you've got some
new things

sensational lipsticks and here the
shades you want to look out for for the
new ones there's strike a pose
purposeful mauve magenta B newest one

hyphenate that the way that I would have
coral cocktail and very chic also

Knicks products including the brand new
Avant pop ten color shadow palettes they

different palettes in art throbs surreal
my heart and Nouveau chic and I can
actually show you one other thing that
was in that because my friend
Kirby's Miranda actually gave me
something out of her bag this is the
go-to palette in dispensable and it has
six shades and then there is a blush a
bronzer and a highlight I'm wearing the
shades today and I absolutely love the
shadows that I worked with today
they were super easy to work with I am
really excited about these I can tell
you that the bronzer is not fun to work
with it's not easy to use I am enjoying
the blush but I can see a little hard
pan developing so I'm a little nervous
about that I'm a little disappointed
that these shades are so so similar I
would have loved to have had a matte
shade here for this light color overall
really really loving this this is not
out yet but I am assuming we will be
seeing this in coming weeks how's that
