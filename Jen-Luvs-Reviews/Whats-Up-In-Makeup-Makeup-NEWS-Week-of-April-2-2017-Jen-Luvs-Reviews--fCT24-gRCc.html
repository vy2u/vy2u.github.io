found you will not believe where and
smaller may just be better I'm Jen from
Jen Lowe's reviews and what to the
makeup starts now welcome to what's a
food makeup for april second 2017 let's
get started with some top industry news
we found out last week that Nakia joy
was one of the Mac social media stars
and got a glimpse at her pale pink lippy
this week during a makeup tutorial she
announced that she'll be launching her
own cosmetics line later this year she
gave a quick sneak peek of some natural
wispy lashes that'll be part of the line
all lashes will be cruelty free silk or
synthetic for more information and
updates as they become available follow
her on instagram at Nakia joy cosmetics
or just keep watching here last week we
heard about problems when trying to buy
makeup through facebook groups but what
about when you buy makeup through a
supposedly well-known and reputable site
is it real is it safe that brings us to
a lesson one person learned when
ordering makeup through group on cats
I'm a kitty cat 42 on imager ordered
what seemed to be a legit Urban Decay
Naked 2 palette from the site upon its
arrival she compared it to another Naked
palette she owns and immediately knew
something was not right
turns out palette was counterfeit she
then took to imager to try to warn
others of the risk stating I
accidentally ordered a fake Naked 2
eyeshadow palette from Groupon they were
gracious enough to refund me right away
but they didn't ask me to return the
fake one
I thought I would make a post to compare
the fake and the real and these photos
the top pallets are real and the bottom
palettes or the counterfeits the
packaging is obviously not the same
though the shadow shades are close
enough to possibly pass to an untrained
eye some might ask what's the big deal
with it being fake studies conducted on
fake makeup have revealed dangerous
ingredients such as mercury and arsenic
if you're seeking the look of higher-end
makeup but can't put out the higher-end
money consider a do
many cosmetics such as nyx and
colour-pop have comparable dupes for
less and remember when seeking out a
more affordable option if it seems too
good to be true it probably is
let's face it we all want to save some
money but we have a way for you to get a
little make-up for a smaller price
Mini's snatching these cuties off the
shelves at Ulta and Sephora is a great
way to get the products you want while
saving some serious cash and less likely
to go bad before you can finish them
