hello my friends this is jen from Jen
loves reviews and you are washing what's
up in makeup happy late April Fool's Day
did you catch all of those jokes on
Instagram by all of the beauty brands
these were some of our favorites here at
what's up and makeup we saw that essence
came out with a new trend called the
color tongue temporary tattoos there
were 10 a sensational flavors they send
with tiny aroma pearls that ensure the
flavor lasts up to 12 hours the flavors
advertised were orange strawberry apple
popcorn and chocolate also Rimmel posted
on Instagram a new vanishing mascara
remover that looked a lot like regular
mascara Nix had a funny one called the
knicks unibrow they even had it up on
their website but it was considered sold
out they did a similar one last year
where it was a completely empty palette
giving you the perfect natural look I
love nixes april fools jokes they're
great and the last one that we wanted to
mention was from Birchbox they came out
with a special edition saved by the box
Birchbox that you could order featuring
a bottle of peroxide to get that Zack
Morris bleach blonde look a to kelly
from Zack mixtape a bottle of hair spray
for that perfect 90s flip raise your
hand if you had that 90's flip with the
hairspray way you took the curling iron
and you meant like the rock and then you
had the big giant wings so yeah you see
got some hairspray and then also a
lavender lipstick and a cordless phone I
think that was a cordless phone or it
was one of the first cell phones I'm not
sure it looks like a cordless phone to
me but either way companies all over
makeup an on makeup had a great time on
April Fool's Day and all of their
customers had a great time too except
for those that fell for the Oreo one I
because that actually looks like a
pretty good idea in YouTube news julieg
came out with a new line of polishes
with jesse's girl called the candy shop
collection the full set of 9 polishes as
$36 can also get those for four dollars
each and she describes them as a jelly
bean finish so i don't know if that's a
jelly finish I don't know that's her way
of covering herself people say they're
had a real jelly finish because of blah
blah blah so she calls it a jelly bean
finish so that she doesn't have to hold
to that I don't know that's my guess
either way I am very curious about those
jus air has released its own
subscription box called Allah match box
but it is temporarily out of stock you
can choose from warm or cool the
subscription was $45 a quarter or you
could get a one-time box for $65 you do
take a beauty quiz before you order the
box so that they can pick the best
products for you you air says that all
of the products in the box are full-size
and drugstore news NYC came out with the
New York color city proof eyeshadow
primer it is a crayon form they called
the ultimate prep for creaseless and
more vibrant shadow L'Oreal came out
with a new version of their miss manga
mascara called the miss manga rock
mascara and it purposely cloaks your
lashes into little spikes so this is not
a look that I would personally rock I
can see where this might catch on as a
trend exclusively at Target Sonia Kashuk
came out with a ton of new brush sets
well three new brush sets one of them is
the 10 piece brush set for at $36 you
get a powder brush a blush brush
appointed foundation brush a dense
powder / blush brush a concealer brush

makeup 6 piece brush set for $25 you

creative a is to emphasize precise areas

define with an angled brush the final
brush set from sonia kashuk is called
the contour five piece set for seventeen
dollars you get a large duo fiber brush

and beauty business news Cote has
acquired bushwa cosmetics from chanel

to have a wider distribution in the
United States coty brands include calvin
klein OPI philosophy marc jacobs Rimmel
Khloe and Sally Hansen so look out for
the bushwa Brad showing up in more

ugh store report from Veronica over at
Vila loca 777 on youtube at walgreens

called circa and it looks like it is by
Eva Mendes the other one is called color
prevails and the prices are both from
between ten and twenty dollars for a
product color prevails brand has i
shadow palettes that come and really
really cute packaging and it looks like
a butterfly wing according to Veronica
