industry news of the week starting with
kathleenlights collaboration with makeup
geek we've received a sneak peek of the
highlighter palette three shades that
range from a fair pick a shoe to a deep
golden hue the price has not yet been
announced have you ever heard of blush
cetacean well after the story you
probably will wish you never did on Fox
News's sports court two men bo Dietl who
is a Fox contributor and mark Simone
who's an NYC radio host where asked
their opinions on Olympians wearing
makeup and this was the answer just you
just have to see it to believe it
Olympians are sexing it up more than
ever by wearing makeup during their
competitions do you think that women
should feel like they need to be
empowered by wearing makeup the whole
point of the Olympics the whole reason
for this training for this work to get
there is product endorsements when you
see an athlete why should have to look
at some chicks zits what some guy sits
on his face we're not a little blush on
her lips and cover those it's why not
the men wear a little makeup too little
blush it ation on her face let them look
good to look at our swimming it okay
what's that skinny guy they got 118 gold
medals Michael foul that guy to look at
whatever ask look how beautiful you are
would that make up what do you look like
when you crawl out of bed naman it if
you look like a washed-out reg no one's
going to support would you put money by
a gal that won the gold medal it looks
like a washed out Rick I just I just
can't to face owner Jerrod Blandino has
given us several sneak peeks on his
Instagram of the upcoming Papa don't
peach blushes and now we can finally
piece together a complete picture of the
products we can see the packaging the
inside mirror and some of
powder pans and they will smell like
peaches still no word yet of the price
or how many patterns / aids there will
actually be but the blushes will be
available in spring 2017 now if you've
been anywhere in the what's up and
makeup community this week you've heard
about the two-faced Kat Von D
collaboration called better together the
better together palette has a
heart-shaped package with half pink for
to face and half black for kat von d the
sides are connected with magnets that
can be broken apart for travel each side
features six shades of shadow and a
full-size better than sex mascara and a
full-size trooper liner are included the
palate is $65 now here's the rub when
photos came out the community well let's
just say they were a little underwhelmed
with all of the neutral shades present
there was such great anticipation they
were really hoping that the inside would
have some pops of color but perhaps it
will be more intrigued by the better
together cheek and lip makeup bag this
is an adorable double-sided bag with one
side showing a representation of Piaf
which is Kat Von D's cat and the other
Jared's dog clover it'll contain minis
of the kat von d everlasting liquid
lipstick in x 0 and studded kiss
lipstick in muse to face love flush
blush in so happy together and to face
candlelight glow highlighting powder and
rosy glow they'll also be a better
together best-selling mascara and liner
duo the travel sized versions of the
better than sex mascara and the tattoo
liner in trooper will be twenty dollars
all items will be available in the US
and canada on december 16th and
internationally on februari 14 are you
excited about this collaboration leave
your thoughts in the comments below are
you one of those people that
occasionally does their makeup in the
car well if you are and this bill passes
you may not want to be traveling in new
jersey there is a bill under
consideration in the state legislature
that would prohibit any activity
including drinking and eating that is
deemed unrelated to the actual operation
of the motor vehicle violators could
face a fine of two hundred to four
hundred dollars for the first violation
400 to 600 dollars for the second
violation and a third violation eight
hundred dollars and license suspension
up to 90

testicular cancer he announced on his
Instagram that his doctor had found in
22 millimeter tumor and will undergo
