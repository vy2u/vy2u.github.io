hello my friends welcome back to what's
up in makeup so good to see you this
week oh my goodness
I didn't think we're gonna have a lot of
news this week cuz everybody's getting
ready to gear up for their holiday
collections but girlfriend I got a new
show for you and top news this week not
a big shocker if you have been on social
media this week you know about this if
you haven't let me enlighten you to the
sephora epic fail rewards program
everybody was wigging about this it was
crazy is do people still say Wiggin I do
every once in a while oh my goodness so
let me just give you the quick rundown
on what happened with Sephora's epic
rewards so Sephora promised that they
were going to piece these epic rewards
meaning there was gonna be things that
people were going to be able to spend
ginormous amounts of points on anywhere
from a thousand points all the way to
ten a thousand points so what they did
was they said save up your points now
Beauty insiders two-times points VIPs
three times points VIP rouges four times
points you get a point for every dollar
you spend because these epic rewards
they're coming then they showed
everybody oh my goodness
10,000 points trip to Paris to talk to
people at Lancome 10,000 points and go
to New York City talk to people from
makeup forever
5,000 points Marc Jacobs bag filled with
Marc Jacobs makeup 1000 points becca
cosmetics highlighting whatever
craziness designed by Jaclyn hill I mean
like include champagne pop like people
were freaking out so excited about this
people went to the store they bought a
ton of stuff to wrap up their points so
they could get the reward that they
wanted I mean people just spend a ton of
money then we found out it was gonna
happen on August 10th a lot of people
stayed up all night refreshing their
screen trying to see when they were
going to be available because they
wanted to make sure they got one and
they knew they would probably sell out
quickly so some people stayed up all
night some people read that it was
supposed to happen during business hours
on August 10
so during business hours I imagine
thousands and thousands of people
hitting refresh trying to wait for those
epic rewards to come out now at exactly
355 Eastern Time the rewards went live
and the sephora games began it was
literally not literally figuratively
like The Hunger Games people just adding
things to their car going to their carts
as fast as possible and checking out now
based on what I saw on Instagram it
seems that the rewards were available
for approximately two minutes and it
looks like approximately maybe 50 people
got them I I mean there's no way to know
exactly how many people got them unless
Sephora lets us know how many people got
them but let's just say very few people
got them meaning that thousands of other
people that did not get them were really
really upset at all of the money they
spent in order to save up for these
rewards only not to get them people
staying up all night only not to get
them so social media blew up for Sephora
with angry messages i swearing never to
shop at sephora again swearing you know
take everything back that they just
bought people showing pictures of you
know boxes of things in their cars that
they were taking to their local Sephora
for return because they were just so
upset about the whole program and how it
went down
later on that day the CEO of sephora
went on his Instagram and said to email
and I will apply if I can't I'll link
that email address down below if you
were not able to get us so for a reward
to email them and they'll try to make it
right so for a put out an official
statement on their their beauty chat
board about their position about that
the rewards how they had you know so
many more available than they normally
do but the demand they just weren't
ready for the demand and they sold out
super quickly and the comments down
below were so interesting where you know
the points that people made about how
how could Sephora not know when they've
put out this entire campaign how could
Sephora not expect the demand and based
on how many people were upset about
adding things to their carts and then
having them disappear out of their carts
as they're ready to checkout some people
are saying that they don't
leave Sephora that Sephora is lying and
just trying to smooth things over so
people are swearing never to shop at
Sephora again
now my favorite meme that I saw about
this entire event is this one because
that's totally me I was not able to get
a reward but it's like when the holiday
collections come out will I shop at
Sephora
probably I'm also looking forward to
seeing how Sephora is going to fix this
through that whole email thing and see
how that goes so I would love to hear
your experience with the epic rewards
down in the comments below and how that
went for you of any of you were able to
get the rewards I would love to know
what you were able to get I know Susan W
our QVC reporter was able to snag a
reward and I'm really excited for her
but you know other than that she's the
only person I know that was actually
able to get one so I would love to know
if you got one in your opinions on the
whole fiasco now on to other support
news we've been talking about this a
really long time so let's move on from
this the Sephora beauty box is coming
it's $10 I did sign up for it with my
email address I will put the picture
here if you go to Sephora comm slash
play that's where you sign up for the
wait list for the beauty box if you're
interested in that moving on from
Sephora news that by far the most
exciting thing in drugstore news that I
have seen in a really long time
Maybelline is doing a collaboration with
Star Wars I don't know it's a
collaboration with with a movie and you
collaborate with movie there do you want
a Star Wars collection alright people
are freaking out all over the internet
because Star Wars isn't just for boys
you know and makeups not just for girls
so I'm curious to see how this is going
to sell on the shows it looks super
super cute the advertising is awesome
what it is is it's six lipsticks three
nail polishes and special packaging for
their super sizer mascara so look out
for that in stores at near you coming
soon speaking of coming soon a lot of
holiday palette news release information
coming out this week the first is the
lorac mega Pro - speaking of Fiasco's
the lorac mega Pro one was a huge fiasco
for lorac how they had the very limited
release hardly anybody
then hopefully they'll do better with
the mega Pro 2 it is going to be an all
too exclusive so I'm assuming that that
is going to be something that is going
isn't really super limited edition we're
keeping more people are going to be able
to get it crossing my fingers lorac
learned from that mistake and then also
the Urban Decay vice there's been some
release of some swatches and the some
pictures of the new Urban Decay vice
