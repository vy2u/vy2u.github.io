hello my friends this is jen from Jen
loves reviews and you are watching
what's up in makeup alright couple of
details before we get going with the
news today some people were saying that
they didn't know about some things
because I always talk about the end of
the video so this video we're going to
talk about Italy getting first thing I
want to tell you is there is a what's up
a makeup website you can click the link
below or you can just go to what's at
the makeup calm every week I give you a
video about what's on my face so if
you're curious about what lipstick I'm
wearing or what eyeshadow i used then
you can go and go to what's of the
makeup calm and you will see a little
video that i made for you telling you
what's on my face product reviews of
everything that I used had a little
debacle today with my primer /
foundation combo if you want to hear
that story and some tips of what not to
do then you're gonna go ahead over to
the what's wit makeup website and then
see all the other goodies including
where to buy everything that you see in
this video there are going to be links
to everything and yeah if you're curious
about what was in the episode if you
want to know where to buy them what's up
of makeup calm is the place to go it may
not be available immediately after this
video goes live but within 24 hours of
when this video goes live it should be
up and available the other thing I want
to let you know about is the what's up
in makeup app you'll notice a lot of
times when I show pictures you'll see a
little image of a face above with a
username that's because people have
contributed to this show through the
what's up and make up app if you would
like to contribute products that you see
to the show and be featured in the show
then you can go and download the
whatsapp and makeup appt it is available
for Android and for Apple products and
the links to the downloads to those are
down below as well and they are both
free downloads there is a paid section
but that doesn't have anything to do
with any of the what's up and make up
stuff if you want to learn about the
paint's that can you go to the app and
it'll tell you about that part but the
best part is the community and the
contributing to this show so if you'd
like to be featured that's all you need
to do so on to the makeup news first of
all Sephora epic reward / I think
failure last week that we talked about
people started receiving some of their
products
proving that the epic rewards actually
did happen and people actually got some
products next up Kylie Jenner alluded to
a new lip kit that will include a brown
lipstick she told everyone on her
Instagram to stay tuned for more
information so make sure you follow
Kylie Jenner on Instagram if you are
interested in that product also we have
a sneak peek of max enchanted lip said
found by user Beth Ann Santiago as well
as a sneak peek of lip products from Max
magnificent me collection she's also
showed us at Bobby Brown sterling lights
holiday set and Kat Von D's
collaboration with formula X nail polish
all will be coming soon and also any
more from the app found an image of this
year's tart blush palette it's called
bling on and it looks to be a lot
slimmer than last year's packaging that
everybody seemed to complain about last
year's was super thick so hopefully this
one will make everybody happy ER in the
slimmer packaging now on to sephora
specific news one exciting thing for
high-end beauty lovers sephora is now
carrying burberry products and i could
tell you when i look at some of these
products my heart kind of skipped a beat
ate some of them are quite quite
beautiful I don't know if they are a
high quality but they sure are of high
quality packaging I can tell you that
burberry products there's 32 new makeup
products including the fresh flow
luminous fluid base the lip and cheek
blooms the face contour effects
contouring pen for face and eyes the lip
of velvet lipsticks the autumn/winter
2015 a runway palette oh so beautiful
and also the Burberry beauty box which
is right here this baby is 30 bucks for
vib rouge is only it is quite tiny but
if you are interested in trying some
burberry products like i was this was a
pretty sweet deal considering this
product alone the full-size is
forty-eight dollars this is the light
glow earthly blush I am wearing that as
a con con core as a contour today I
really really like this product a lot
along with that you did
get a they're very very famous fresh
glow here you've got a lipstick this is
in military red I have not worn in this
yet it would have been good with my my
math shirt too I should have worn this
today but this product here I have not
tried it yet it will be tried soon and
then it comes with a little tiny kabuki
brush which is very nice for applying
the contour powder and it is quite dense
and soft and lovely so if you were
interested in getting that that is what
that looks like do I think it's worth
thirty dollars i guess it depends on who
you are so that is my very very fast
review of people burberry bob if you
want to hear a little bit more about it
