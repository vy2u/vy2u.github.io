Pat McGrath labs it's called lush 004
it's three lip kits like no one has ever
seen before Pat stated that and I quote
the kits are inspired by every lip I've
ever done in my career should they

the tricks i've been using backstage and
on photo shoots since day one each lip

matte lipsticks one clear lip gloss

superfine loose glitter the shade flesh

glitter while bloodline brings you
burgundy lip sticks and a garnet colored
glitter in addition to these three kits
which retail for sixty dollars each

bustle calm the eyeshadow palette and

cosmetics calm are you tired of Pokemon
yet well apparently instagramers and
youtubers are not tired of it pokemons
makeup is a huge trend right now can you
guess this one it's togepi we would like
to think we did it first but maybe we
were second in case you missed it I'll
leave a link to the what's up and makeup
reporters and Friends pokemons go
challenge in the infobox home Pokemon go
gotta catch them all youtubers alyssa
ashley and alyssa forever have team to
create a challenge that is putting black
own beauty brands on the shopping list
of many people the challenges for
youtubers of all ethnicities to create a
makeup look using as many black own
brands as possible since that list is
super long and there's many many lists
me found on the internet i will be
linking some blogs down below if you're
interested in doing this challenge the
new max alena collection will be

tember 28 and from the photos that will
make you both laugh and cry at the same
time department this I know many of us
have tasted it but this toddler actually
ate her aunt chocolate bar palette she
ate it eighteen-year-old Lauren rakan
caught her one-year-old knees Caitlyn
eating her palate not knowing if she
would laugh or cry Lauren contacted to
face who told her that there aren't any
harmful ingredients in the palette but
to take Kaitlyn to the doctor she showed
any signs of illness so this proves that
if you want to eat your palate
technically you can but who would do
that when you go get a Hershey bar for a
dollar 25 at the drugstore but brownie
point
to face you sent Lauren a brand-new
chocolate bar palette free of charge in
