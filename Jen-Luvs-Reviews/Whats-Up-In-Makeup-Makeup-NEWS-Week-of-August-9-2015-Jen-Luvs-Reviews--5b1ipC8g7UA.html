information as we hear it next up Kat
Von D is selling a lot of her products

jcpenney they have had some flash sale
kinds of situations on a Sephora website
if you love Kat Von D products I know
that the chrysalis palette was on sale
as of the filming of this video it may
not be on sale now but definitely keep
an eye on the sephora website because
Kat Von D is clearing out a lot of her
stuff to make room for a lot of new
products that she is starting to develop
and finish up with I'm assuming for the
holiday season on our Instagram she's
released some information about some I
shadows that she's been working on for
five years she says don't even bother to
try to guess what they are you'll never
get it they're just that unique really
curious about those also she's got some
new lip liners and a special lipstick
for charity face has come out with a new
collaboration palette now this is a
unique one because it is not a
collaboration with someone on YouTube
but someone on Instagram it is the
Stardust palette by Vegas nay she's best
known for her beauty photos on Instagram
there are 12 matte and shimmer shadows a
loose glitter pigment deluxe sizes of
Too Faced shadow insurance and better
than sex mascara and then six look cards
the release date for this is august
twenty-third the price is $45 and then
going on to an announcement by occ their
famous lip tars are changing their
packaging they were the first ones that
we my knowledge to come out with the
tube lip formula now they are moving
into the traditional lip gloss container
with the doe foot applicator this change
in packaging will begin in the fall of
this year nyx is opening their first
stores in San Francisco and in Los
Angeles California and they're due to

to Megan Wharton on the what's up a
makeup appt she has found some new
pictures of the holiday

did not previously have so let's go
ahead and go through those the first one

to the fresh sugar lip delight for $55
the buxom leave your mark set for $32
the Bobby Brown University lip palette
for sixty dollars and the Marc Jacobs
the Sophia mini lips they set for $45
that's the one that looks the most
exciting to me personally Megan also

description except for the change in the
oil base of water-based but right now
the oil base only has one shade where
the water base has six different shades
showing these are supposed to be mixed
into foundation to get your perfect
shade they look a little scary with the
red and the blue and the bright yellow
but I'm assuming makeup artists know how
to do these things that's why they get
paid to do what they do gevo she has the
