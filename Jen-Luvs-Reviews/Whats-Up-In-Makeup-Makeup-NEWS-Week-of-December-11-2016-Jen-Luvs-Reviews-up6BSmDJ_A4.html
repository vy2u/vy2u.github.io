cosmetics looks like Kylie might have
some competition and the best boyfriend
ever I'm Jen from Jen loves reviews and
what's been makeup starts now welcome to
what's up and makeup for december 11
2016 let's get right into the top
industry news we all know that cosmetic
products are made out of various natural
and synthetic ingredients and mostro
where that some of these ingredients may
be harmful but are you aware of how
little our government protects us from
possible hazardous ingredients in these
products did you know that only 11
cosmetic ingredients are regulated by
the FDA you may be surprised to know
that the last us legislation to pass on
regulating the safety of cosmetics was
nearly 80 years ago now take a moment to
think about how cosmetics products have
changed since the 1930s that's why
lawmakers are bringing up these concerns
posing questions about possible risks
and calling for the FDA to help the bill
would require the FDA to evaluate a
minimum of five ingredients per year to
determine their safety and appropriate
use the first two ingredients they are
targeting are from aldehyde and propyl
paraben the review process stated in the
bill would provide companies with clear
guidance about whether ingredients
should continue to be used and if so
what the concentration level should be
and whether consumer warnings are needed
big parent companies like Johnson &amp;amp;
Johnson Procter and Gamble Revlon Estee
Lauder and L'Oreal are supporting this
bill along with organizations such as
the environmental working group and the
Society for women's health and research
british reality TV star Charlotte Crosby
has unveiled her new makeup line the
star of geordie shore a british reality
television series broadcast similar to
the US as at Jersey Shore has created
fleek a 40-piece line of products
ranging in price from 39 pounds
ninety-nine for the ten shade highlight
palette to 24 pounds ninety-nine for the
contour palette this converts to around
fifty dollars to $32 respectively it has
been my dream to launch my own makeup
range I get so many comments from my
fans asking for makeup tips and
breakdown
my look so this is for them stayed in
Charlotte who has often mentioned her
admiration for the Kardashians and
Jenner's looking at the packaging it
seems that the line may have been
inspired by Kylie cosmetics products are
available now at the easy locks website
link below in the video description 2016
is coming to an end and that means that
the best and worst lists are starting to
make the news the campaign for a
commercial-free childhood has their own
award for this year's worst toy it's
called the toady which stands for toys
oppressive and destructive to young
children this year's winner was Lulu's
pink fizz beauty essentials little bow
feet collection 11-piece makeup set
which is aimed at children aged 3 and up
the packaging promotes the ultimate glam
makeup collection in a box but it won
the tony award for containing harsh
chemicals and promoting sexuality and
children through the art on the cover of
the box as well as the use of makeup by
children in general the box the toy
comes in the toy meant for children
actually states to keep out of reach of
children but what are these harmful
ingredients that have been identified
the biggest offenders are talc mineral
oil titanium dioxide propylparaben and
fragrance all common ingredients in
adult makeup do you feel the tody was
well deserved we'd love to hear your
thoughts in the comments below mirror
mirror on the wall help me remember what
in the world this department store
makeup artist did to my face so I can
recreate it at home now that doesn't
quite have the same ring as the original
magic mirror Neiman Marcus is helping
its customers with a magic mirror that
actually does record your makeup
sessions the new in store makeup mirror
digitally records the makeover
experience and every cosmetic product
use can be accessed through a dedicated
URL which links the customer back to the
makeover session these new memo me
mirrors are rolling out in 21 Neiman
Marcus locations around the US and
speaking of makeovers like many people
17 year old Tatiana's Schneider really
wanted to go to Coachella but tickets
are way out of her budget her best
friend and boyfriend Jordan Rona
offering to lend her the money but
Tatiana refused not feeling good about
taking the money from him
but not willing to take no for an answer
Jordan had a different plan as Tatiana
booked a series of makeovers to help
cover the cost her biggest client was
Jordan since Tatiana posted the pictures
of Jordan on Twitter she has gained
media attention for her skills and he
has gained the same for his ability and
willingness to rock a makeup look for a
good cause now that's a special kind of
love and finally do you remember the
