and we have sponge so don't desert us
I'm Jen from Genlis reviews and what's
of and makeup starts now welcome to
what's up and make up for December
eighteenth 2016 let's get right into the
top industry news of the week the highly
anticipated two-faced sweet peach
collection launched as expected with
tens of thousands of people waiting into
the night to buy their peach scented
goodies early Wednesday morning the
virtual line kept the site from crashing
but also kept users waiting for hours
past midnight tens of thousands of
people were able to get their hands on
the collection that included the
eyeshadow palette highlight palette
blush and lip glosses and by late
morning the line had died down and only
the highlighter had sold out Thursday
marked the much quieter launch on
sephora.com and also calm we're all
products are still available the blush
lip gloss and eyeshadow palette are
available on HSN with the shadow palette
available on flex pay if you could be
patient products will be available in
ulta stores on january fifth and spore
stores on january sixth also in to face
news Jerrod Blandino gave us a sneak
peek at the upcoming natural love
limited edition shadow mega palette
coming summer 2017 he also revealed on
periscope that there will be an animal
themed palette named after his dog
clover coming soon the cosmetics market
is expected to reach over three hundred
ninety billion dollars globally by 2020
and we all know that it costs much less
to manufacture makeup than consumers are
being charged now a new website is
breaking the rules and changing that for
you beauty pie is banking on the concept
that you will pay a small membership fee
each month for the chance to buy a
high-end cosmetics for cheaper than
drugstore prices here's how it works
beauty pie sources lipstick foundation
lip glosses and other products from
major cosmetic labs in France Korea
Italy Germany the UK and the USA they
repackage and then sell them under the
beauty pie label okay think about a $24
mascara you can choose to buy it at the
high
price or buy it into the beauty pies
monthly membership plan and for a ten
dollar membership into the club you can
buy that same $24 mascara for two
dollars and six sets total cost to you
is twelve dollars in six cents versus
the twenty-four dollars you can also
choose a lipstick to go with it which
would retail for twenty-five dollars or
just two dollars and thirty eight sets
total cost for both items and the
subscription would be fourteen dollars
and 44 cents instead of $49 beauty pie
will not release the names of the labs
they work with but an article in bazaar
magazine suggests the formulas are very
similar to brands such as Charlotte
Tilbury Bobbi Brown nars and Chanel the
service is available in both the UK and
the US it should be noted however that
even subscribers have to pay for
shipping there's also a shopping
allowance that limits how much makeup
you can buy in a month however unused
allowance money does roll over to the
following month to find out more with
all the details go to beauty pie calm in
recent weeks silicone makeup applicators
have burst onto the makeup seen one of
the most hyped is the silly sponge by
Molly cosmetics they cannot keep the
product in stock however Molly house
another product in the works it's called
the silly sponge Stardust this limited
edition cream and liquid makeup tool
will fit inside most makeup compacts to
replace the included foam applicator
release date is expected in early
January followmolly cosmetics on
Instagram for updates kathleenlights us
having some problems fulfilling orders
for her new nail polish line KL polish
folks who pre-ordered are still waiting
for their polishes while others who
purchased later have already received
their orders and some customers received
orders with broken bottles Kathleen said
that the pre-orders were a mess and that
the delays were unexpected and vows that
it will not happen again many new
companies experienced bumps in the road
but in her usual classy way she emailed
everyone who pre-ordered to explain and
take responsibility color pops
