reviews and what's up and makeup starts
now welcome to what's up in makeup for
December 4 2016 hope you're all feeling
good after Black Friday and Cyber Monday
let's get into some top industry news
now take a moment to look at these two
images how similar do you think they are
is one infringing on the copyright of
the other this is a question that a
judge may have to answer from makeup
artist of lata haggerty and Kylie
cosmetics lada has claimed that Kylie
has copied her work before vladas lawyer
told WWD that the artwork causes public
confusion Kylie cosmetics sells its
products under a logo that is so similar
to the dripping lip art style that
symbolizes amiss haggerty's makeup
artist brand that she receives daily
inquiries as to whether she's associated
with Kylie cosmetics said Stephen
McArthur of the MacArthur law firm
photographer and blogger julia Coombs
kuzmenko McKim is also on Team vlada and
a recent blog post she presented the
history of similarities between vladas
and Kylie cosmetics images in the post
McKim claims that the same dave Lauda
posted the holiday image that Kylie
cosmetics allegedly mimicked she also
posted another image in which she tagged
photographer marcelo con tu marcelo shot
the Kyle a cosmetics holiday image in
question and McCann implies that con tu
must have seen the post and used it as
inspiration people often point out to
McKim that the lips in the two images
are different in response the blog
presents an image of another piece of
Lauda's work from sep tember with a lip
resembles the lip in the Kylie cosmetics
photo Kylie's representatives have not
responded to requests for comment are

picture with the caption I'm up to
something peachy just for you my
Instagram darlings make sure you're
following me tomorrow night December
first at 945pm PSD for a sweet surprise
at that time two-faced opened the
floodgates to shoppers wanting to buy
the to the sweet peach eyeshadow palette
customers were led to an online queue
which gave the number of people in front
of them and their estimated wait time
but of course not all went as peachy as
two-faced expected customers complained
about waiting for over an hour getting
into the shop and then being promptly
kicked back out into the queue others
noticed a glitch in the system by
stopping the queue page before could
load some customers were able to skip
the line altogether potentially leading
to incorrect wait times for people
waiting in the queue though there were
some difficulties it seems that all who
did want the pellets were able to get
them before the pre-launch ended early
Friday morning the official launch date
keeps changing slightly as of the
filming of this video the collection
will be on two faced and two fours
