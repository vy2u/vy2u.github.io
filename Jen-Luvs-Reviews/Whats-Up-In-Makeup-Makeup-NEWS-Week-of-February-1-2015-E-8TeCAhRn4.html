loves reviews and you are watching
what's up and makeup big news at least
for me because I'm a huge the bomb fan
the bomb came out with new eyeliners
this week so excited and they have the
most creative names they are called mr.
right now sugar pill also released their
new spring line of eyeshadows there's
nine of them all together and they are
stinking gorgeous oh my goodness oh my
goodness in high-end news should now
release their spring line I am NOT going
to try to butcher the French name so I
will just type them down below but I'll
tell you basically what we've got here
they released three new nail polish
shades a powder blush shade a multi
effect Quattro eyeshadow quad a
long-lasting eyeliner three new shades
of the intense long wear lip color to
sheer lip shines two gloss immers to
precision lip definers two Ultra wear
lip colors a brand new mascara and a
vital Lumiere moisture rich radiance
sunscreen fluid makeup in the shade of
soft bisque you can get that entire
collection for six hundred and sixty six
dollars coincidence
maybe but maybe not in Sephora news
Estee Lauder released some new lip
products they're the pure color and the
shine sculpting shine lipsticks and
there are fifteen shades and they're $30
each tart also released two new products
the smooth operator Amazonian clay
tinted finishing powder in four shades
from fair to tan and also the tardis
clay paint liner that looks really
really cool it's like a squeezy tube and
it comes the product kind of squeezes
out almost like a lip balm and then they
give you an eyeliner brush that you dip
into it and apply it looks really cool
so I might actually get that and try
that because that one looks really neat
NARS also released the narcissist dual
intensity eyeshadow palette not too long
ago there's eight shadows in it it's got
also got a travel size of brush they can
be used wet or dry so that you can make
them darker or lighter depending on your
daytime nighttime needs or your style
what
ever'one you want to go with this is the
company I have never heard of but I have
a feeling we're going to be hearing more
about them at Sephora in the very near
future
Besame Cosmetics came out with a
brightening vanilla face powder that
supposedly smells like vanilla and it's
new and exclusive to Sephora it is a
face powder that controls redness and
brings a warmth to the complexion is
what they say and it's a velvety soft
for all skin types it has a yellow tint
that is what controls the redness and
it's ideal for light to medium skin
tones they say you can also use it to
brighten your dark under-eye circles or
just an overall matte finish in natural
makeup news geek chic is exploding with
all new eyeshadows and products they
have two new lip glosses called moon
princess guardian and guardian of Venus
for five dollars each
they also have a new powerup primer for
$5 and the hunger games series is
officially available it's called ever in
your favor which i think is so cool and
creative if you don't know geek chic
cosmetics you must at least go there and
window-shop because they have the most
creative eyeshadow names ever like I'm
not even kidding so they have the Hunger
Games collection it's nine shadows
individually there's $6 a piece but you
can get the complete collection for $59
and also you can get the limited edition
tan with everything in it for sixty
three dollars and that's the nine
shadows the new eyeshadow of the month
for February is called hypernova and it
is lip safe and it is available on
February 1st which is today and also
their spring collection comes out today
and it is Sailor Moon themed there's 12
shadows two lip glosses 10 nail polishes
and again it releases today and it is a
hundred and thirty dollars for the
entire collection I present per came out
with their limited edition brush set
they're on sale Walt supplies last the
travel kit was fifty three dollars and
now it's twenty five the starter kit was
82 and now it's 45 and the complete set
was 170 and now it's 95 so jump on that
the new pomegranate oil lipsticks in
eight shades are $25
the reviews on the website praised the
formula but the pictures don't seem to
be quite true to color what people are
receiving so definitely keep that in
mind if you're planning on ordering
those the all natural face has a vegan
and a bowl love dust they have vanilla
Sparkle and cocoa sparkle they're ten
dollars each you can eat it but you're
not really supposed to eat it and it's
really just meant to be a highlight
speaking of food ego emme is jumping on
the chocolate fix an addiction of a lot
of people out there and they have a
chocolate box with eight products for 16
dollars and it's a mix of edible and
non-edible chocolate products how fun in
altar news Stila came out with some new
shades of their color balm lipstick and
the shade collection is called the nude
interlude collection also urban decay
came out with another one of those cases
where you can keep four shadows it's
like those empty pallets they're ten
bucks it's actually really cool looking
but you got to still fill it with the
eyeshadows so you're gonna end up way
over ten bucks if you do that the Urban
Decay vice limited edition palette came
out this past week and everyone seems
being buying it up it is still for sale
as of the filming of this video Tiffany
over Tiffany beauty of 101 who is our
Ulta reporter for this new show did
purchase it and she is really loving it
right now she says some of her favorite
shadows are perversion junk show and
vaporize Real Techniques is beefing up
their collection and also adding two new
brushes to their traditional original
makeup line there is a sculpting brush
and a concealer brush that they've now
added they're also now selling the bold
metals collection exclusively at Ulta
there are say seven brushes that's a lot
holy moly
alright let's go through these new
brushes we have the triangle foundation
brush the angled liner brush the oval
shadow of the tapered blush brush the
arched powder brush the pointed crease
and the flat contour brush and it looks
like their prices are going up quite a
bit
I remember that brushes being pretty
reasonably priced but I don't remember
him being $26 a brush
real techniques I don't know what's
happening with that but I'm not like
that price increase am I going crazy
here or did they raise the prices the
skincare company al Janice just came out
with a new tinted moisturizer they're
selling at Ulta for $42 but I do want to
let you know that they are also selling
it at QVC at QVC it is $36 not 42 and
that there is free shipping on that
product also at QVC Laura Geller is
coming out with a new liquid foundation
called the baked liquid radiance
foundation and it comes with a brush
they're selling that for $39 including
shipping 39:36 it's not gonna be
available to ship though until March
26th and it's gonna come in seven shades
laura geller says that this is
definitely a full coverage foundation
it's supposedly for any skin tone any
skin type that's a lot to say especially
for those in need of high coverage on
the skin but a natural looking finish so
I'm curious to see what the reviews are
gonna be like for that one not a whole
lot no at the drugstore this week but
I'll tell you a couple little highlights
first of all Milani came out with some
color statement matte lipsticks in eight
shades I have a feeling those are gonna
show up everywhere last time I checked
Milani was having a 30% off sale on all
of their lip products on their website
so you might want to check that out and
see if that's still going on wet and
wild also reformulated and repackage
their silk finished lipsticks when Wilde
says that they are conditioning
ingredients of vitamin A and E aloe vera
and macadamia nut oil in those lipsticks
sounds pretty moisturizing I wonder if
it holds up to that claim and finally in
Mac news Mac has been making its way
through fashion week abroad in Berlin
and Hong Kong this week and you can
follow this fashion week journey on
Instagram they're taking lots of
pictures and showing all of the fashion
week goodness from all over the world as
