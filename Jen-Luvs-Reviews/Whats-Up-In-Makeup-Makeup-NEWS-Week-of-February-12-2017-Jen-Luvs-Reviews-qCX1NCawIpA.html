only be one Kylie and do you practice
safe sponge I'm Jen from jet mode
reviews and what do the makeup starts
now welcome to what's up and make up for
February 12 2017 and here are the latest
top industry news stories the legal
battles a trademark the name Kylie has
been won by Kylie Minogue according to
an article on Metro co uk the original
Kylie's lawyers sent the US Patent and
Trademark Office a long list of reasons
why Jenner's trademark should not be
granted the letter argued that Kylie
Minogue was an internationally renowned
performing artist humanitarian and
breast cancer activist known worldwide
simply as Kylie and described Kylie
Jenner as a secondary reality television
personality Australia and Kylie who's
Gary era was once declared a national
treasure now has autonomy over her name
Jenner's legal team has filed Appeals
who is the one true Kylie tell us in the
comments below showing up to the gym
with a full face of makeup is becoming
more than norm these days however
skincare experts are warning against
this trend because wearing makeup while
working out can have negative effects on
the skin Emily Moss's hair training
manager at Bioderma warns that pours
need to be free of makeup in order to
allow a healthy level of water and oil
to exit if pores are unable to breathe
during this wedding process they could
become easily clogged leading to
blackheads spots and dull skin before
the gym skin should be cleaned with a
gentle cleanser then moisturize with a
light cream or serum says montazere she
recommends also cleansing the face
immediately after a workout and applying
a light ultra hydrating moisturizer if
going to the gym their face is just not
an option for you Fred Lapierre national
face designer at YSL Beauty says that
there are two rules you must follow one
always go with products that are
lightweight and texture and apply
lightly and to cleansing afterward is a
must a recent study out of the
University of Groningen suggests that
plastic surgeon
are missing the signs of a serious
disorder when consulting with patients
seeking cosmetic procedures body
dysmorphic disorder in which a person
can't stop thinking about one or more
perceived effects or flaws in their
appearance is believed to occur in
approximately ten percent of patients
who pursue cosmetic procedures however
after having these procedures performed
up to ninety five percent of patients
with BDD are generally not satisfied and
often look to having additional
procedures performed so why aren't more
doctors intervening many cosmetic
professionals say that they address body
image problems during consultations but
additional results from the studies show
that while they say they are familiar
with the condition only two-thirds of
those doctors admit to diagnosing an
average of one to five patients with BDD
over the span of their careers even more
concerning less than half of those
doctors consult with psychiatric
professionals when they do suspect a
patient has BDD Beauty consumers are
always looking for that next big thing
or at least something that works better
than what they're currently using the
Beautyblender took the market by storm a
few years ago as a revolutionary new way
to apply foundation recently silicon
makeup applicators have become all the
rage neither seemed to be fully
satisfying many consumers because makeup
sponges like the Beauty Blender tend to
absorb product while silicone
applicators like the silly sponge don't
absorb but they also don't seem to blend
the product as easily as the Beauty
Blender what is a foundation lever to do
well youtubers and instagramers decided
to try something new wrap a beauty
sponge in what else a condom after
unwrapping a brand new condom they rinse
place the Beauty Blender inside and
blend the foundation out on their skin
this method has been tested by many with
mixed results would you practice safe
