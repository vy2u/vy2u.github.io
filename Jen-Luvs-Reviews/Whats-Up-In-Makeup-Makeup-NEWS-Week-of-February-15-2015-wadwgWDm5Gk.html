loves reviews and you are watching
what's up a makeup happy belated
Valentine's Day I wore my heart shirt
for you in makeup news this week
two-faced released big shocker a contour
palette or any of you surprised it is
the cocoa contour kit it contains a
highlight in a shade called light cocoa
a sculpting shade in both medium cocoa
and dark cocoa and that a contouring
shade in a shade called pop of light I
am so surprised they don't have the milk
chocolate in the dark chocolate in there
I'm curious to see the swatches to see
how those shades compare it also comes
with a contour boogie brush and a little
glamour guide to show you how to use the
kit speaking of kits Marc Jacobs came
out with an eye liner kit it is called
the blacker is better I defining
essentials and it contains a magic
marker precision pen eyeliner in black
or a high liner which is a crayon style
eyeliner in black ER and then an omegle
ash volumizing mascara which I try to
sample of and it was really really nice
very volumizing separating really nice
mascara at kohls this week the balm
released a new quad palette and it is
called Mont bomb and it is marketed for
girls on the run it's $15 also walls on
the coals website I also noticed a quad
called la bamba steal the spotlight also
for fifteen dollars I don't know if
that's new or not but I've never seen it
before so I figured I'd mention it just
in case let's go ahead and jump a
distance of foreign news with some nail
polish and it looks like the trend for
spring is going to be shades of white
according to formula X the new for mini
lacquer set is called white party and
the lacquers are in a dainty which is an
ivory white delightful which is in a
dove gray precious which is in a mint
white and blushing which is a cotton
candy pink jumping also on that trend
nails inc has released a new line for
spring it is called the new white and
each nail polish is fourteen dollars
each they released a baby pink one a
peach one a smoky gray one and I
mint one and it's supposed to be
conditioning nail polish that paints on
white but then dries with a subtle color
jumping on the pastels for nail polishes
the spring ciate released the ice cream
collection all of the minis are named
after ice cream flavors the naked better
fudge which is a yellow cream double
bubble gum which is a blue believe it or
not ice frappe which is a new dream wham
bam strawberry jam which is a pink cream
and pistachio la la which is a soft
green cream it also comes with some self
stick nail decals that kind of make it
look like your nails are dripping like
melting ice cream also they include some
directions on how to apply everything
and get that perfect manicure Benefit
Cosmetics came out with the pretty
parfait kit it's $38 and it is in a
collectible ice cream shop tin that
looks very reminiscent of the Christmas
Tim that they came out with for the
blush set that they had this holiday
season this kit comes with a full size
they're real mascara also it comes with
a full size Benetint a sample size of
the professional and a little mini of
the laugh with me Lily perfume special
rapporteur emily from inside sephora she
has some updates on some products that
she has been getting feedback from from
the customers have been coming into
sephora that we've been talking about in
previous weeks the first one is the Marc
Jacobs Lamarck lip creams which I'm
actually wearing one today I'll tell you
what she says first she said that they
are so so pigmented there Matt they had
cocoa butter in them so they're not
super dry and I totally agree with that
let me show you I did a little mini
order at Sephora online so that I could
get to this little tiny baby sample and
this one that I'm wearing today is
called kiss kiss bang bang and it is the
new the new formula and I am enjoying
and I agree with her it is not drying at
all i'm really really enjoying this
formula will i buy a full size probably
not but i do like that i have a little
sample of it she also wanted to give us
an update on some of the feedback she's
been getting from the diorskin noodle
airline that just came out she said that
she feels like people that have normal
skin are the happiest with the
foundation for those that do like it it
has a nice coverage and it's bill
a bowl but she said it's definitely not
for oily skin at all because it becomes
really really shining oily only after a
few hours and it's also not for super
dry skin either because it seems to sink
into fine lines after just a little bit
of wear as far as updates on the powder
that goes with it she said it's very
light and breathable and has a nice feel
but it definitely needs to be touched up
through the day because you do get shine
just after a few hours finally in
high-end Sephora news girl on came out
with a new meteorites compact they call
it a pearls compact that creates a
subtle and natural effect by giving
every skin tone just my right amount of
light and correction reviews say that
the results are very subtle for this
product and QVC news this week on Friday
there was the tart tsv or today's
special value that they had on which was
very interesting and even if you missed
it I did want to mention there are a
couple of new products from Tarte that
they did feature in that that I'm hoping
they're going to be adding to their new
line which included the Amazonian clay I
and cheek palette and also the maracuya
miracle found sealer found sealer have
we now created a new product it's not a
foundation is not a concealer it's a
fountain sealer no it just made my mind
just explode all of a sudden really cool
good luck I don't even know what to do
it I can't even handle it while we're
talking about QVC QVC just started
carrying Eve pearl cosmetics which I was
very happy to discover it imats in New
York last year they are now carrying the
blush trios which go by your skin tone
the HD dual foundation with a brush and
sponges and the dual salmon concealer
with a brush they also have the
invisible finishing powder with a brush
and an eye palette with two brushes a
QVC reporter Susan did want to let you
know that these are on a waitlist for
the most part somewhere on our wait list
some of them aren't you going to have to
check the website to see which ones
today or wait-listed and which aren't
two other things she wanted to mention
tart has a new colored clay full
coverage cci base for 20 to 25
aight i always crack up at the prices at
QVC they always have the weirdest change
in there it comes in both yellow and
pink tone depending on your coloring
finally Isaac Mizrahi I think that's how
you pronounce it does a lot of fashion
stuff came out with a lip gloss set with
a wristlet for thirty-nine dollars they
say that it's infused with peppermint
oil and vitamin E to help condition and
protect your lips and also it has a
sheer shine with see-through colors if
you like high pigmentation this is not
going to be a set for you and they say
that it is a satin lip shine just a
couple of things in drugstore news this
week Maybelline has snuck in some
limited edition color tattoos into some
of the drugstores recently there's three
of them one of them is called hibiscus
pink next one is called petunia Punk and
the last one is called hydrangea hype i
do not have photos for those because the
only ones I could find we're on blogs
and I did not have permission to use
them they are not public domain so
hopefully you'll be able to find them in
stores and be able to see them they did
seem like they had shimmer in them but
that's all I've got for you so far if I
get some pictures they'll be up next
week in what's up in makeup Maybelline
also released a matte master blush stick
and rut Rosie rush which also I don't
have a picture of because Maybelline is
being secretive about these things I
don't understand why they don't just
tell people a we've got new stuff go buy
it like I just I don't know I don't get
it I happen to be a huge fan of
Garnier's BB cream they've now released
a miracle skin Perfector daily anti-acne
BB cream so I'm curious to see how that
compares to the original that I
absolutely love and finally Nix has now
released a define and refine powder
foundation but it sold out on their
website and I can't find it anywhere
else but they did want to show you the
picture of it it's right there they say
it's essential medium to full coverage
compact features a deeper crescent of
color with a hint of pearl you're
supposed to blend them together to
customize your look for perfection
year-round it is twelve dollars and
hopefully it'll be back in stock soon in
natural make-up news balance guru has a
free full of love miss worth ten dollars
with every purchase and that's valid
februari 13th through 15th i think that
over isn't that over know that ends

want that jump on that notoriously
morbid has new flavors of their costs
coffin kissers lip balms Matheson's
marshmallow fluff jaymund grape soda
Stoker's sangria post pistachio cream

dollar value with any purchase of a 120
