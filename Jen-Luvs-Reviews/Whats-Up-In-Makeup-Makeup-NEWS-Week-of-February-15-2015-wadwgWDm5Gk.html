hello my friends this is Jen from Jen
loves reviews and you are watching
what's up and makeup happy belated
Valentine's Day I wore my heart shirt
for you in makeup news this week
two-face released big shocker
hey contour palettes or any of you
surprised it is the cocoa contour kit it
contains a highlight in a shape called
light cocoa a sculpting shade in a both
medium cocoa and dark cocoa and then a
contouring shade in a shade called pop
of light I am so surprised they don't
have the milk chocolate on the dark
chocolate in there I'm curious to see
the swatches to see how those shades
compare it also comes with a contour
Buki brush and a little glamour guide to
show you how to use the kit
speaking of kits Marc Jacobs came out
with an eyeliner kit it is called the
blacker is better eye defining
essentials and it contains a magic
marker
precision pen eyeliner in black or a
highlighter which is a crayon style
eyeliner in black ER and then an O mega
lash volumizing mascara which I try to
sample of and it was really really nice
very volumizing separating really nice
mascara at Kohl's this week the balm
released a new quad palette and it is
called mont balm and it is marketed for
girls on the run it's $15 also was on
the Kohl's website I also noticed a quad
called la bamba steal the spotlight also
for $15 I don't know if that's new or
not but I've never seen it before so I
figured I'd mention it just in case
let's go ahead and jump a distance of
foreign news with some nail polish and
it looks like the trend for spring is
going to be shades of white according to
formula X the new four mini lacquer set
is called white party and the lacquers
are in a dainty which is an ivory white
delightful which is in a dove gray
precious which is in a mint white and
blushing which is a cotton candy pink
Jumping also on that trend nails Inc has
released a new line for spring it is
called the new white and in each nail
polish is $14 each they released a baby
pink one a peach one a smoky gray
and an iced mint one and it's supposed
to be conditioning nail polish that
paints on white but then dries with a
subtle color jumping on the pastels for
nail polishes this spring ciate released
the ice cream collection all of the
minis are named after ice cream flavors
the naked better fudge which is a yellow
cream double bubble gum which is a blue
believe it or not iced frappe which is a
nude dream wham-bam strawberry jam which
is a pink cream and pistachio la la
which is a soft green cream it also
comes with some self stick nail decals
that kind of make it look like your
nails are dripping like melting ice
cream also they include some directions
on how to apply everything and get that
perfect manicure Benefit Cosmetics came
out with the pretty parfait kit it's $38
and it is in a collectible ice cream
shop tin that looks very reminiscent of
the Christmas tin that they came out
with for the blush set that they had
this holiday season this kit comes with
a full size their real mascara also it
comes with a full size
Benetint a sample size of the
professional and a little mini of the
laughs with me Lele perfume special
rapporteur Emily from inside Sephora she
has some updates on some products that
she has been getting feedback from from
the customers and then coming into
Sephora that we've been talking about in
previous weeks the first one is the Marc
Jacobs Lamarck lip creams which I'm
actually wearing one today I'll tell you
what she says first she said that they
are so so pigmented their matte they
have cocoa butter in them so they're not
super dry and I totally agree with that
let me show you I did a little mini
order at Sephora online so that I could
get to this little tiny baby sample and
this one that I'm wearing today is
called Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and it is the
new the new formula and I am enjoying it
and I agree with her it is not drying at
all I'm really really enjoying this
formula will I buy a full size probably
not but I do like that I have a little
sample of it she also wanted to give us
an update on some of the feedback she's
been getting from the Dior skin noodle
airline that just came out she said that
she feels like people that have normal
skin are the happiest with the
foundation for those that do like it it
has a
nice coverage and it's buildable but she
said it's definitely not for oily skin
at all because it becomes really really
shiny and oily only after a few hours
and it's also not for super dry skin
either because it seems to sink into
fine lines after just a little bit of
wear as far as updates on the powder
that goes with it she said it's very
light and breathable and has a nice feel
but it definitely needs to be touched up
through the day because you do get shine
just after a few hours finally in
high-end Sephora news girl on came out
with a new media rights compact they
call it a pearls compact that creates a
subtle and natural effect by giving
every skin tone just my right amount of
light and correction reviews say that
the results are very subtle for this
product and QVC news this week on Friday
there was the Tarte TSV or today's
special value that they had on which was
very interesting and even if you missed
it I did want to mention there are a
couple of new products from Tarte that
they did feature in that that I'm hoping
they're gonna be adding to their new
line which included the Amazonian clay
eye and cheek palette and also the
maracuja miracle found sealer found
sealer have we now created a new product
it's not a foundation is not a concealer
it's a fountain sealer it just made my
mind just explode all of a sudden I'm
really good I don't even know what to do
and I can't even handle it
while we're talking about QVC QVC just
started carrying Eve pearl cosmetics
which I was very happy to discover at
IMATS in New York last year they are now
carrying the blush trios which go by
your skin tone the HD dual foundation
with a brush and sponges and the dual
salmon concealer with a brush they also
have the invisible finishing powder with
the brush and an eye palette with two
brushes our QVC reporter Susan did want
to let you know that these are on a
waitlist for the most part somewhere on
our wait list some of them aren't you're
gonna have to check the website to see
which ones today or wait-listed and
which aren't
two other things she wanted to mention
Tarte has a new colored clay full
coverage CC
I base for 2228 I always crack up at the
prices at QVC they always have the
weirdest change in there it comes in
both yellow and pink tone depending on
your coloring finally Isaac Mizrahi I
think that's how you pronounce it
it does a lot of fashion stuff came out
with a lipgloss set with a wristlet for
$39 they say that it's infused with
peppermint oil and vitamin E to help
condition and protect your lips and also
it has a sheer shine with see-through
colors if you like high pigmentation
this is not going to be a set for you
and they say that it is a satin lip
shine just a couple of things in
drugstore news this week Maybelline has
snuck in some limited edition color
tattoos into some of the drugstores
recently there's three of them one of
them is called hibiscus pink next one is
called petunia Punk and the last one is
called hydrangea hype i do not have
photos for those because the only ones I
could find were on blogs and I did not
have permission to use them they are not
public domain so hopefully you'll be
able to find them in the stores and be
able to see them they did seem like they
had shimmer in them but that's all I've
got for you so far if I get some
pictures they'll be up next week in
what's up in makeup Maybelline also
released a matte master blush stick and
Rutte rosy rush which also I don't have
a picture of because Maybelline is being
secretive about these things I don't
understand why they don't just tell
people a we've got new stuff go buy it
like I just I don't know I don't get it
I happen to be a huge fan of Garnier's
BB cream they've now released a miracle
skin Perfector daily anti acne BB cream
so I'm curious to see how that compares
to the original that I absolutely love
and finally Nix has now released a
define and refine powder foundation but
it sold out on their website and I can't
find it anywhere else but they did want
to show you the picture of it it's right
there they say it's essential medium to
full coverage compact features a deeper
Crescent of color with a hint of pearl
you're supposed to blend them together
to customize your look for perfection
year-round it is $12 and hopefully it'll
be back in stock soon in natural makeup
news Balance guru has a free full of
love miss worth $10 with every purchase
and that's valid there you were
13th through 15th I think that's over
isn't that over no that ends today
today's the 15th
woohoo so if you want that jump on that
notoriously morbid has new flavors of
their costs coffin kissers lip balms
Matheson's marshmallow fluff jaemin's
grape soda Stoker's sangria post
pistachio cream Lovecraft's limoncello
and Bradbury's banana pudding I think
those are all vampires pretty sure about
that which would explain coffin kissers
the last thing that Julia wanted to let
you know as far as natural news is that
100% pure is giving out a free mascara
and eyeliner which is a $43 value with
any purchase of a 120 dollars on line
only in altar news ck1 has released some
new lip glosses for $15 there are 15
shades of those their minerals has
released some brand new eyeshadow
palettes that look absolutely amazing
there's three different variations they
are $48 each and that's what those look
like over there and bare minerals does
claim that the eyeshadow actually
delivers skin nourishing benefits
including reduced appearance of fine
lines wrinkles and puffiness with use of
their eye shadows Lancome has released a
Lido stick and it's $36 and it's
released in five different shades their
contour shade is used to shape and
define your features and of course the
highlight is used to illuminate and
emphasize your features it cosmetics has
released a new concealer called the eye
color correcting full coverage cream and
it's for lightening under-eye circles

your delicate skin and reduce puffiness

pretty amazing that they can shape
makeup into something like that I just
think that's really cool Dior has
released a new line of lip glosses
called the Dior brilliance and they are
supposedly very very good for
moisturizing your lips while also giving
you a lot of pigment there's three
different types of oils in them and also
some vitamin E and also something that
helps with the collagen in your lips and
there's a range of twelve different
shades for these new lip glosses now

released their new spring line and when
I saw this I was like I have got to show
them this just for the sheer beauty of
this product I mean what really like
