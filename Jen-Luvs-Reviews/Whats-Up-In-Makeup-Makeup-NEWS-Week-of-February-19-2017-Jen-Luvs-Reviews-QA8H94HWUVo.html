this then we've got some news for you
I'm Jen from Jen Lowe's reviews and what
savvy makeup starts now welcome to
what's been makeup for February 19 2017

news New York Fashion Week brought us
some makeup Wow as well as some wth
trendiness here are some highlights from
the 2017 spring/summer shows
girls night out scene at the Anna Sui

Cosmetics Gordon s Pinet for the de
sequel's show brush strokes by Diane
Kendall for the tongue show kendall
focused on clear beautiful skin first
then painted on The Strokes will you be
trying any of these looks tell us in the
comments below
blinded by beauty that's exactly what
almost happened to 16 year old Tyler
Dury who experienced an extreme allergic
reaction to one of the ingredients in a
common eye lash and brow dye kit I'm
concerned as she and many members of her
family had previously used coloring
products Tyla failed to perform the
manufacturer's suggested reaction tests
she applied the product as directed
waited the standard time for processing
and washed it off everything seemed fine
pleased with the result she thought
nothing else until around 30 minutes
later when the area around her eyes
began to itch what Tyler was unaware of
at the time is that this product
contains a chemical to what she was
about to have a severe reaction pair
phenylenediamine PPD commonly found
in inks for henna tattoos as well as
hair dyes Tyler woke up the next morning
to a nightmare she stated I woke up
almost blind because of the reaction my
eyes had blown up like huge balloons it
was like having beach sand thrown in
your eyeballs and not being able to get
it out and then stinging like razor
blades on my eyebrows doctors
hospitalized the terrified Tyla and
began treatments for chemical burns to
her eyes she was told that she was lucky
the reaction did not blind her and must
now see an optometrist regularly to
monitor the lasting effects of the
reaction doctors have also warned her
that using a product containing PPD in
the future could possibly permanently
blind or even kill her Tyla states
I am never using dye on myself ever
again and shared her story in order to
warn others to follow the product
recommendations and perform a reaction
test each time you use a product
cruelty-free cosmetics customers and a
few more fluffy bunnies around the world
can rejoice after an on-again off-again
relationship Stila is once again on the
cruelty free list once sold in China a
country which mandates that animal
testing must occur for cosmetics sila
has now removed all of their products
from China's market Korean beauty lovers
are celebrating all the way to
Nordstrom's Asian beauty products can
often be difficult to come by but
shopping for these items has gotten a
lot easier thanks to Nordstrom's the
store has launched a k-beauty concept
shop bringing hi and Korean skincare
makeup body products and other favorites
closer to the doors of the masses
decorated in kpop inspired items such as
spinning light displays and fuzzy pink
yoga balls the pop-up shops launched in
seven North American locations Seattle
Los Angeles Dallas Chicago Vancouver
Toronto and Bellevue Washington
this happened on February 10th but if
you're not near those cities have no
fear the pop-up is also online the shops
will featuring more than 500 products
including cult favorites such as
too-cool-for-school Nordstrom states
that based on performance they may
consider making more Kei beauty products
a permanent part of their inventory
Albrecht
mortar locations and the online shop
will be running through March 26
Jake Jaime Ward aka the beauty boy on
YouTube has been named one of the faces
of Laurie Oz latest infallible total
coverage campaign after seeking ways to
use cosmetics to cover his acne as a
teen then moving on to his channel of
makeup tutorials for men Ward has worked
to end gender stereotypes within the
beauty industry he says I clearly
remember standing in the makeup Eilidh
boots being surrounded by advertisements
featuring only women I very quickly
realized that I wasn't alone and that I
wanted and needed to make a change to
the industry Ward will be featured on
campaign posters in both boots and
Superdrug stores in the UK he will also
be alongside former X Factor winner
Louisa Johnson in the hero video
advertisement
despite being iffy at the box office
fifty shades darker is still having an
impact on the cosmetics industry Rimmel
has announced the release of the
limited-edition movie inspired
collection in collaboration with one of
the movie stars Rita Ora the collection
will consist of five products including
a Rita red lipstick mr. gray nail polish
and more each will have our signature on
the specially designed packaging sadly
there are no plans for a launch within
the States the collection will only be
available in the UK choosing to possibly
lose business in order to put their
beliefs first is a huge step that is not
often seen in today's society Illamasqua
is making this bold move by requesting
that anyone purchasing products agree
with their newly added human
fundamentalism pledge agreeing means
that you vow among other things to never
discriminate against race color
nationality ethnicity age or sexual
orientation villa Maskull also states
through a spokesperson we know that we
can't physically stop people buying our
makeup and it's unethical to force
people to change their beliefs so we are
politely asking those who don't agree
with our human fundamentalism pledge to
stop buying our products we understand
that we may lose customers and fans from
this statement however we strongly feel
the need to always prioritize human
rights over profits illamasqua joins a
list of
beneath such as Nordstrom dove and it's

stand did you ever love the unicorns
