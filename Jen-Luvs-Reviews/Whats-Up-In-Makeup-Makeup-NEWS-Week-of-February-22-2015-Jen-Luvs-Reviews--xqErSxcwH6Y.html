reviews and you are watching what's up
in makeup
hope you're keeping warm in this
freezing cold weather we've been having
lately I know at least where I live it
is absolutely freezing but let's go
ahead and talk about something a little
more awesome which is what's up at
makeup this week the most exciting thing
for me this week was the release will
not release but the announcement of the
release of the new NARS blush duos will
blush bronzer highlight ish duo's they
are called dual intensity blushes
they're gonna be new and they're gonna
be permanent they're gonna be amazing I
think and they're gonna be in stores at
Sephora
on March 4th on April 1st they're gonna
be in specialty stores and department
stores so excited for these I mean they
are just like my heart stopped I looked
at them and I was like oh my goodness
and it's like you know and things like
that
it's like woody some people they look at
beautiful birds and beautiful flowers I
look at that and I think the exact same
way it's like wow so of course they
recommend the blush brush going along
with those but I'm sure that that's not
100% necessary it does look like a nice
brush though next up Estee Lauder is
coming out with a brand new collection
they've worked with with fashion
designer Andre corage I think I'm saying
it right it is a 13 piece limited
edition line the formulas are described
as light translucent and reflective with
a papi palette there are two lip visors
in two different shades clear and coral
a super gloss in rosy future and
illuminations face powder some super
lashes that are super expensive and only
35 bucks or something crazy like that to
i amplifiers in aqua silver and black
silver and i glide pencil in Silver
Streak and iridescent ball highlighter a
lip and cheek ball in ultra pink an
ultra white eyeliner and lunar white
that matches his fashion style very very
well if you google him everything seems
to be pretty much in black and white and
then a brand new kabuki brush those will
be available in March there will be
early access at Sephora for vib rouges
and vib members so keep your eye out for
that their minerals
also released a new line of passion
blush balms there are three different
shades in Posie passion papaya passion
and natural passion they've also
released the pop of passion lip balms in
eight shades and those are sixteen
dollars each the blushes are twenty two
each Nordstrom has released an exclusive
palette by Smashbox
it's called crush on blush and it is a
limited edition palette for $45 it
includes four blushes in warm apricot
guava Rosie and rosettes bronzed lights
in Sun Tan or soft lights in shimmer and
a get the looks insert to help you
figure out what in the world you're
doing with all these colors very very
very exciting in Sephora new Sephora is
now carrying Kevin a Quan makeup oh so
exciting with the release of the regular
line of Kevyn Aucoin products they've
also released a contour book called the
art of sculpting and defining its $59
and you get all of those shades and a
bunch of tips and all kinds of things
I'm curious to see how that compares to
all the other contouring palettes that
are coming out right now
speaking of contouring dr. jart came out
with a BB matte contouring 1-2-3 kit and
you can see the shades that you use
there that's $45 in primer land Shiseido
has come out with the glow enhancing
primer with SPF Lancome is all about
erasing and correcting with their labate
pro-poor erasing primer I believe yes
primer yes that's what I meant to say
that guy is also going to help you
conceal with the ultimate coverage
concealing cream and also the under eye
brightening corrector those are supposed
to be used together the under eye
brightening corrector is supposed to be
used underneath the concealer as a
backlight for your concealer I'm not
quite sure what that means I'm hoping
that someone will do a tutorial so that
I can see what in the world they're
trying to do to sell this extra product
and whether it's actually worth it or
not also very exciting in Sephora news
and I think I'm not sure if it's only
being sold at Sephora but I know that
it's being sold at Sephora is the hot
collection it was released to vib and
vib Rouge members early in the week now
it is open to everyone
our reporter Emily from inside Sephora
has checked out all of these products
and has given us all of her opinions and
the opinions of her customers on them
the cheek palate she said they both have
great thick maintainer formulas there's
two of them her only problem with it is
the one that's in pink the two pink
shades are very very close in color so
she's a little bit upset about that like
coming when you know about that but she
says she likes the other one a little
bit better just because there's a little
more contrast in the color selection and
within the palate there's also the hot
and nudes shadow palette that's
beginning mixed reviews in her store
some people seem to love it some people
don't like it she says they have a nice
pigment but then some of them are a
little bit powdery and some of them do
have fallout so then she said there's
nothing particularly bad about it but
she said she doesn't think she's gonna
purchase it because there's so many
amazing nude eyeshadow is out there
personally I don't really care for the
packaging I think it looks a little
cheap dare I say I don't know what do
y'all think about the packaging hos
palette they also came out as part of
this line with three art sticks in
orange pink and berry there's supposed
to be like a lip crayon a lip liner in
one Emily says that they are very
pigmented and they do dry matte I should
have mentioned this when I'm starting
out all the other contour stuff but
Clinique has also come out with some
contour products building on their
chubby stick line there is a sculpting
contour stick and also a sculpting
highlight stick Emily in sight Sephora
says that the contour stick she says
doesn't seem to be working on light skin
tones it seems to be a little too orange
but seems to be working a little bit
better on the darker skin tone she says
she's it's great formula though just
hoping they release it in more shade so
that more people can get the benefits of
the formula of this product few more
things in Sephora news YSL came out with
a contour eye primer in two different
shades fair and medium bite Beauty came
out with a whole new lipstick line
they're called butter cream lipsticks
and there are eight shades and they're
nude two neutral shades Estee Lauder
also released a pure color and the shine
sculpting shine lipstick is that right
shine sculpting shine lipstick that's a
lot of shine they're in fifteen shades
nail-polish news nails Inc has released
a really interesting product called the
blossom foil effect nail polish they're
$15 each and there's
you can wear them alone or ver over a
complimentary polish and it looks like a
flower pattern and it's really really
neat almost like crushed flower is just
really cool-looking and finally if
you're into the skincare josie maran

bloom argan hydrating color collection

it comes with a 1.7 ounce pure argan oil
light and argot infinity intensive
creamy oil a coconut water cheek gel and
poppy paradise I love your lips
hydrating lipstick and playful pink and
then finally an Argand Lac oil mascara

strange but that's what it says that's
what they chose to call it so that's
what we got a set and natural news MBA
