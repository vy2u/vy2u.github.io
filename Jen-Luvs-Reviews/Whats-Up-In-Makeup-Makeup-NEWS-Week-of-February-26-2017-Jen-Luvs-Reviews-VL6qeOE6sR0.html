Kanye throws his hat in the ring and
what's that extra surprise ingredient
hmm I'm Jen from Jen Lowe's reviews and
what zip and makeup starts now welcome
to what to then make up for February 26
2017 let's take a look at some top
industry news we've all seen social
media buzz about the upcoming Rihanna
cosmetics line Fenty beauty but what's
real and what's just disturbia last year
we heard that the first offering was due
in spring of 2017 and would be a
holographic lipstick
however the company's official agency a
bold PR has now discounted that rumor in
fact the only official information the
agency would reveal was that makeup
artist James Vincent would be leading a
search for a global makeup artist for
fenty Beauty a representative from bold
PR stated any other post and/or chatter
are from fan pages they're
enthusiastically awaiting the launch and
our unofficial and conjecture about the
launch it may not be what some of you
wanted to hear but there is one bright
spot it seems that fall 2017 may be
holding a surprise after all more
information as it becomes available in a
world full of celebs creating and
collaborative UT industry it is no
surprise to see new celebs jumping into
the arena
what does surprise some is when you see
members of the same family circle going
against each other in that industry
that's exactly what may be happening
sometime in the future with Kylie Jenner
and brother-in-law Kanye West West has
filed the necessary paperwork stating
his plans to create a line of perfumes
lotions and other cosmetics the line
which will be named in honor of Danza
Kanye's mother who passed away in 2017
although the paperwork is still being
processed it is said that it is just in
case the line does happen in the future
a decision and notice has been issued
regarding the class-action suit brought
against Sephora the suit alleges that
Sephora unlawfully deactivated thousands
of US customers
counts from their website in November of
2014 these accounts had email addresses
associated with three china-based email
service providers that use Chinese as a
default language plaintiffs claim that
alleged deactivation of these accounts
subsequently led them to not being able
to participate in the 2014 vib sale it's
a twenty percent off sale offered to vib
and vib Rouge customers the settlement
will require Sephora to pay a total of
nine hundred fifty thousand dollars
after all is said and done courts
estimate that money will be divided into
either one hundred twenty-five dollars
cash or $250 electronic gift cards for
all authorized claimants after all
claims are settled if any funds are left
over the remaining will be donated to
the nonprofit organization of the
National Asian Pacific American Women's
Forum Sephora will not be eligible to
recoup any of the net settlement
proceeds both sides of the suit disagree
on who would have won if this had made
it to trial and under the heading of do
not try this if you have ever traveled
by plane then you know that getting just
a simple clear bag of beauty products
past security can be a royal pain there
are limits to the amount of products
each must be under 3.4 ounces well can
you imagine trying to sneak a 2.3
kilogram that's 5 pounds worth of
moisturizer past the TSA some of us may
try to sneak in a bottle of water an
extra to of sunscreen but the Ecuadorean
suspect was trying to hide something
much more surprising it turns out that
the suspect who was traveling from Peru
to Thailand had a skin care routine
containing more than the usual it
contained cocaine that's right she mixed
cocaine into her facial creams in an
attempt to smuggle them across borders
the punishment for drug offenses in
Thailand are quite severe including the
death penalty for some offenders seems a
lazy high price to pay for beauty in

there will be another generation Beauty
