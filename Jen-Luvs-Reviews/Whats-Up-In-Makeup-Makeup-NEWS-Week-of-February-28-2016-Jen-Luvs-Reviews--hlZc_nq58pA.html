edits by estee and mac helps us feel
finally free i'm jen from Genlis reviews
and once of a makeup starts right now
hello my friends and welcome to what's
up and makeup februari 28th 2016 here's
what's new and top industry news we need
to stop the presses stop the pixels
break the internet mac has announced a
collaboration with none other than
Caitlyn Jenner as I said in their
announcements this is not a drill this
is really happening the collaboration
will be for a single product a lipstick
called finally free it's a creamy rose
shade that will look pretty on anyone
and everyone according to Mac the
lipstick will go on sale on April 7th
it's priced at seventeen dollars and one
hundred percent of the proceeds will go
toward the MAC AIDS Fund transgender
initiative in order to further work in
support of transgender communities so
with this little lipstick be the herald
of bigger and better things from Caitlyn
Jenner we'll keep an eye on the story
for you folks are loving the makeup geek
and man emu AI shadow palette but as you
know the course of true love never runs
smoothly here's how we got the story
from marlenas and Manny's snapchats
Tuesday was a launch day in the palette
went live around nine or ten a.m. as a
surprise it was scheduled for 2pm let's
call that the pre-launch and it sold out
within an hour they still did that 2
p.m. launch and we hear they employed
three extra servers to handle the load
wasn't enough so they added two more and
after a couple of hours to get it up and
running the batch sold out on Wednesday
they launched in the morning and that
batch was gone in under half an hour
they're restocking early next week but
it's unknown how many units they'll have
did you get one tell us in the comments
down below stay with me on this one this
one's really interesting for a while ron
has marketed a collagen boosting product
called lift on express for its
anti-aging applications but now the
increasing number of people getting
tattoos has inspired a new collagen
boosting product called lift on expert
active
freshly tattooed skin requires
specialized care and as more people are
joining the tattoo trend including
thirty-eight percent of Millennials and
visibly repairing cracked cuticles and
nail care applications come into light
in addition to the immediate soothing
effect on tattooed skin the formula also
targets anti-aging lifting and wrinkling
stretch mark reduction and visibly
repairing correct cuticles and nail care
applications the Borghese and for those
who remember the 80s the princess
Marcelo bore gaze brand is undergoing a
few changes in the aforementioned 80s
the board gaze was a department store
brand since then it's most often found
its paws and its specialty retailers now
with the installation of a new global
president there are plans for more
effort into the direct consumer
platforms this might include more
ecommerce direct sales media outlets
like QVC and infomercials and other
methods we'll keep you posted one thing
we do know is that borgess was sold at
target and the ad is currently
participating in their five dollar gift
card with $20 cosmetic purchase that's
their program they're running now it
might be a good way to get acquainted
hashtag not sponsored and hot off the
press more fees first liquid lip

shade is called vinyl and it's a shade
created for every skin tone the release
