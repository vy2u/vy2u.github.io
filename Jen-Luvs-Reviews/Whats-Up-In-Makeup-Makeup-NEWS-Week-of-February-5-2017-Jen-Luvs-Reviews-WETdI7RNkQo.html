something does not smell like peaches
I'm Jen from Genlis reviews and what's
been makeup starts now welcome to what's
it been makeup for february's fifth 2017
we have a lot to tell you this week so
let's jump right into top industry news
something smells like I mean doesn't
smell like peaches the new Kylie
cosmetics royal peach palette which
launched in January 12th has been a
subject of complaints about the smell
instead of peaches many say it smells
like everything from bleach to spray
paint to death youtuber shop or Mandy
post the video on January nineteenth
before the scheduled restock warning
buyers of the problem she said it smells
like death she also claimed it gave her
such a bad headache and made her so
nauseated that she couldn't even have it
with her in the room while she filmed
since the video went live several other
anti royal peach pallet videos have
popped up and tons of customers are
flocking to social media or have emailed
the company to complain about the
horrible smell some buyers are guessing
that it may be the plastic and the
packaging while others think it may be
the glue that holds down the pans either
way customers are questioning whether or
not the pallet is safe for use those who
have emailed Kylie's customer service
regarding the issue are receiving
generic responses the responses report
that their safety team attributes the
smell to an odor from the glue and the
packaging and that the eyeshadows are
safe to use they say it just needs to
air else but many have said that they
have allowed their pallets to air out
and the smell won't go away one customer
is not letting this go lightly this gal
has emailed back and forth with customer
service six times at this point she's
reported the kyliepeach palette to the
FDA is demanding that Kylie cosmetics
produce a MSDS or material safety data
sheet that proves this so-called sticky
glue is safe for use however as of right
now currently cosmetics is refusing to
furnish this information as well as
declining multiple
media outlets request for comment
request for refunds are being denied and
is leaving customers frustrated and
angry seems like the only recourse
customers may have is to contact their
credit card company used to make the
purchase and report the pallet unusable
and or defective your brows may say more
about you than you think new research
done by neuroscientist dr. Javed Sudhir
a professor of Neuroscience at Canada's
renowned University of Lethbridge says
that a person's eyebrows are the key to
revealing a person's emotions eyebrows
can communicate the full spectrum of
emotions from aggression to fear to
Joyce as dr. sudhir his study called the
role of eyebrows in facial recognition
and conducted at MIT studied six
emotions happiness sadness anger fear
disgust and surprise the study revealed
that the upper compartment of the face
played a role in each emotion but who
are the real brow experts enter Benefit
Cosmetics who decided to combine their
brow expertise with dr. sudhir
scientific knowledge to create the
benefit brow translator a micro-site
designed to use facial recognition
analysis to learn what your brows are
truly saying about your personal
feelings and emotions the website has
been off and running it since January
sixteenth vivek benefit brow translator
com capture upload a photo and you'll be
able to see what your brows are really
saying about you and an instagram makeup
trends couldn't get any more strange
introducing the world of fine makeup
seriously the only make up that would be
applied to the legs and thighs but maybe
some bronzer or perhaps even some
contouring but now makeup lovers are
taking makeup evolution even further by
doing a full contour on yes the thighs
these makeup levers are using actual
based products such as I shadows liners
and even brow products the looks are
uncannily realistic and some are even
three-dimensional some skeptics are
calling it a waste of makeup and just
can't understand what the point in it is
at all while others are loving the
freedom of art and creativity and
speaking of the never-ending quest for
perfection if you are often wondering
your makeup never looks like some of
your favorite youtubers no matter how
hard you try it may be because it simply
isn't possible in a controversial video
released this week Wayne Goss exposed
the effectiveness of filters and
lighting that some content creators use
in YouTube video production Wayne
demonstrated this by showing how he look
in natural light in artificial light and
then add it on a filter that can be used
in post-production to smooth the skin
and create an airbrushed look many
people know that filters are often used
for images on Instagram but the use of
filters on YouTube is less well known
Wayne believes these filters are so
fundamentally wrong what do you think
