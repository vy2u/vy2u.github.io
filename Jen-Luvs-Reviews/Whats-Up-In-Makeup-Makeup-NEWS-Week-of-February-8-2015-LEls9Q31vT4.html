call it at Sephora when they give you
free stuff to try so you can tell
customers how awesome it is bag and
she's super excited about it she said it
does have some curling effect but she
wishes the brush was just a little bit
bigger it was really wet when she
applied almost a little bit too wet but
it made her lashes so long that it was
leaving spots on the top of her I
another thing she mentioned she was
reading about it in the the information
they gave her and they said it's
supposedly very nice paired with their
real master their real gives it volume
