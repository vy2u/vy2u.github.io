loves reviews and you are watching
what's up in makeup mac recently
announced the release of their new
collection on January 29th and it will
be in Nordstrom on February 2nd and all
stores on February 5th and it's called
Toledo and is named after designers
Ruben and Isabel Toledo Ruben designed
the packaging which is in a white tooth
with rubbery texture and Isabel's face
is the design how cool would that be to
have your face on matte lipstick what I
thought only Rihanna got that privilege
there are 45 new products to be launched
what's up with that I wonder how long
it's gonna last maybe 45 minutes we
shall see supposedly there's going to be
a lot of Reds and the lip products a lot
of hombres and the cheek product
eyeshadow palettes are going to have
lilacs and neutrals pops of blue and a
little bit of lime thrown in it sounds
like a fancy mixed drink to me the
drugstore has been exploding with new
products the most exciting ones coming
from covergirl and L'Oreal cover girls
coming out with that new bloom mascara
I'm really excited to see what that's
all about
the new colorlicious lip sticks were
reviewed earlier this week by Emily
Noelle 83 her biggest complaint on those
was that you could not see what the
finish was in the tube that you could
see what color family it's in but it's
really difficult to actually tell
whether you're getting a shimmer or
satin or a frost even covergirl also
came out with some new eyeshadow quads
the Queen collection was beefed up with
the CC creams and the lip glosses there
are 13 shades in the lip glosses now and
the CC cream has five shades altogether
L'Oreal came out with a new foundation
from their infallible line that's
supposed to be all in that foundation
coming up some rave reviews they
describe it as a demi and matte finish
that lasts up to 24 hours I don't know
about 24 hours I don't know of any
foundations the last 24 hours good you
are up for 24 hours girlfriend you need
to wash your makeup off and go to sleep
as far as high-end Bobby Brown recently
came out with an extra illuminating
moisture bomb for the skin a new limited
edition
I shadow palette and new shades of her
lip gloss CC cream and the natural brow
shaper and hair touch-up tool Chanel
came out with the new jardin de Chanel
blush in camellia rose that thing is
beautiful do you see that do you see
that magical Ness but it's limited
edition and it is 55 smackers they've
also announced a new line of Coco Rouge
lipsticks they're gonna be 32 dollars
and they're gonna be released this March
and QVC news it cosmetics has a today's
special value coming out this coming
Monday this today's special value will
include five different items including
the new CC plus eye correcting full
coverage cream which has a cooling
applicator interested to see what that
looks like it also includes the color
correcting full coverage cream compact
and it's a revamped version of their
popular CC cream but they put it in a
compact it also comes with the angled
buffing foundation brush which is a
slanted brush and the blurred lines
smooth fill lipstick finally it comes
with the CC plus airbrush perfecting
powder and the shades that are going to
be available our fair elect medium tan
and rich how's that for a skin tone rich
nice along with that today's special
value there also going to be having some
other features for it cosmetics
including the naturally pretty radiance
duo and French boutique brush that
sounds fancy it includes the hello light
anti-aging radiance illuminating powder
and the vitality cheek flush and pretty
and peony and it's a soft peachy pink
shade and also the heavenly luxe French
boutique blush brush and if it's
anything like the heavenly luxe powder
brush that thing is going to be amazing
also not to be ignored on QVC they just
started carrying the Perricone md makeup
line also QVC announced that tart is
going to have a TSV on february 13th to
see a preview of those products you're
gonna go to susan w's channel who is a
reporter for this news show and she
actually had purchased that on pre-order
so you can check out all the products in
her video and i will link that down
below also from special reporter Vicky
we have a special report on the wet and
wild Fergie celebrity concealer
that is definitely not for dry skin it
is very thick more fully skinned and a
little bit goes a long way and it is
$4.99 at Walgreens she also let us know
that Urban Decay released their spring
line this week and they released a new
Naked concealer and naked powder
foundation and they've also released a
new line of sheer revolution lipsticks
which is so my style because you know I
don't really wear this kind of
brightness on the daily so I'm really
looking forward to checking those out
they've also released a new mascara
called mascara resurrection this mascara
is supposed to be for touch-ups so if
your master is fading during the day
you're supposed to be using this mascara
to kind of revitalize your current
mascara which is a very interesting
concept that I've never heard of before
go Urban Decay on something innovative
hopefully it works as well as they say
it does that's a for recently Renee
reports that the Benefit Cosmetics puff
off has been getting a lot of attention
and it's funny that this thing comes
with the the applicator and it looks
like a little iron which was really cute
and it is metal it's getting mixed
reviews on the Sephora website some
curious to see how this product tends to
fare over time with the many many
reviews that I'm sure will be coming on
YouTube in the coming weeks smashbox
released a photo finish powder
foundation in ten shades that's supposed
to have eight hour wear
they call it light filter technology and
long lasting photo set polymers that act
as a photo filter for your face Kat Von
D of course released her bronzer contour
highlight magical mists that has been
all the buzz on YouTube lately it's
beginning of rave reviews and I am very
very tempted to buy it I'm trying very
hard not to but it's beautiful it has
three highlights three bronzers and it
just looks so versatile and amazing to
face also released not too long ago the
soulmates bronzer which they marketed
beautifully calling them Ross and Rachel
and Carrie and big of course of friends
and Sex in the City
Fame the initial reviews are more
positive for fair skin tones the people
who are reviewing with medium to dark
skin tones don't seem to enjoy it quite
as much people seem to enjoy swirling
those together more than
using them as an individual blush and
bronzer just going to show how those
pairs really should have been together
as for the Pantone color of the year all
the lip and eye shadow colors are
completely sold out already on the
Sephora website I'm really hoping they
bring them back
the only things available right now are
the reddish eyeliner the reddish eyebrow
product I think I'm going to pass on
those Tony Thorson was the first to tell
me about the lorac unzipped gold palette
that came out this week so exciting an
extension of course on the very popular
lorac unzipped palette that was like all
the rage a year or so ago there are ten
shades in this palette and they go from
light to dark and it also comes with a
little mini primer in that set as well
lorac also released the pocket Pro
palette with only three shades for $15
