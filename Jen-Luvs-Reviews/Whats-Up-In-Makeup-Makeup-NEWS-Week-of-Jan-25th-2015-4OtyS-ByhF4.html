loves reviews and you are watching
what's up and make up this week it
Sephora contour palette galore everyone
seemed to be coming out with a contour
palette if it wasn't last week or the
week before it's this week and this week
the one that's blowing up is the one the
Sephora brand contour palette is
beginning rave reviews from the people
who've reviewed it so far it's called
the contouring 101 face palette the
narcissist blush and contour palette
also came out this week it comes with
three blushes in a Roman Holiday and
rapture and enthralled a highlighting
blush in albatross the bronzing powder
in laguna big shocker and the lip gloss
in Asteria one thing to be careful of if
you are ordering this as make sure you
know that this is a very small palette
that sizes of the products inside are
much smaller than the virtual domination
college so just be aware if you're
ordering it don't expect ginormous
products inside also sila came out with
a new nouveau i shadow palette this week
it's forty nine dollars and also coming
out to initial rave reviews clinique
came out with a new concealer is called
the beyond perfection concealer in 20
shades Kat Von D came out with a new a
face primer called the locket
featherweight primer it is supposed to
be a lightweight water-based face primer
that hydrates smooths and protects the
skin while reducing the look of pores
now the initial reviews are saying that
is much better for normal to dry skin
than oily skip you with oily skin do not
seem to be enjoying it at all on sale
this week is the OCC cosmetic color
pencil essentials six piece set the
original price on that is $42 and it is
now cut down to 22 dollars so jump on
that before it sells out if you enjoy
their eye pencils and that product does
have a five star review on safaris
website another deal for you if you're
looking at that brand new bare minerals
tinted like moisturizer kind of thing
it's called complexion rescue if you're
looking at that at the altar Sephora
websites you might want to check out the
QVC website because they're selling the
foundation and the brush that goes with
it for $45 where separately it's a
foreign Ulta you're going to get the
tinted moisturizer for twenty nine
dollars and the brush for 28 so you're
saving quite a bit going through QVC if
you plan on getting the brush
as well onto a bit higher and at sephora
Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana have released two
products that are support exclusives one
is called a shimmer lip it's limited
edition and it's in four shades dolce &amp;amp;
gabbana says that this is the perfect
balance of a lipstick and a lip gloss
and it's pairing color and gleam for a
delicate semi-sheer finish but then
there's like a blue color or maybe it's
gray and then there's like a whitish
color so I'm curious to see how these
are going to looks watch what's people
start getting them in their hands and
they are thirty seven dollars
additionally Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana's come out
with a shimmer powder for cheeks and
eyes and again it's a Sephora exclusive
and it's limited edition it's a
lightweight highlighting cream that
illuminates the arch of the brows and
softly accentuates the cheekbones so
it's a highlighter at Sephora also the
Dior kingdom of colors palette just came
out inside that palette are 10 cut they
call them custom colors and for
professional applicators it includes one
eye liner to lip glosses lipsticks a
highlighter a blush and eye shine to eye
shadows and something called a
mattifying skin Perfector that's like a
little triangle that's like dddd tiny
which I'm assuming has something to do
with blending your eyeshadows cuz i
can't imagine putting that Danny Danny
little space trying to get that all over
my face so essentially you could
probably do your whole face with this
one palette up but it is $85 so
hopefully you'll like the stuff that's
in it when you get it it is coming out
to some mixed reviews also in high-end
landlord more CA came out with her
spring line including a watercolor
missed I and cheek palette and also some
paint wash liquid lip colors in nine
shades they are very very bright colors
I can tell by all the products that are
coming out that the big big thing this
spring is going to be the bright bright
colors it does claim to be a deming that
stay all day formula but the reviews say
that it is a bit thick but it doesn't
stay all day at some are complaining
that it is transferring after an hour
and a half of it being applied to the
lips so that's a little concerning to me
if when you call something long way
you know um sand next up Mark Jacobs
released some new products including the
hashtag insta mark light filtering
contour powder of course because
everyone's releasing contour products
and also the Lamarck lip cream creme
creme creme CR eme with a little thingy
over the e girl on also released the
angelic radiant meteorites curl as of de
blush and it's it reminds me of
something from physicians formula I'm
sure if physicians formula wasn't the
first one to come up with it but it's
got the little baby things in it and
there's three different colors and you
screw them all together and use it as
blush it looks absolutely gorgeous I
mean you could see the picture right
there it looks beautiful I am curious to
see how the reviews are going to cut out
on that one YSL also released some mono
I shadows that just singles are only
available at Saks and there are thirty
dollars each they claim to have all day
wear chromatic power no priests and no
migration and intense color payoff
they're available in matte satin
metallic and shimmer finishes our
glasses modernist I shadow palette is
coming out to some mixed reviews and
it's very odd when you read the reviews
on safaris website it's like three and a
half stars and people are like they're
creamy and they're amazing they blend so
beautifully and then people will like
their chalky and they're terrible and
don't buy it like I just feel like I
want to put my fingers in them and try
them myself because obviously somebody
is a bit confused are they creamy or are
they powdery make up your mind I'm
trying to sound if I want to buy
something or not you know I'm saying nor
is released they are brand new all day
luminous weightless foundation recently
YouTube has been exploding with all
kinds of reviews of this product it
seems to be a very light drippy kind of
formula kind of like the bare minerals
bare skin it is forty-eight dollars and
it's in 20 shades I will link some
excellent reviews of that product down
below in case you're interested in
learning more information and seeing
that product actually applied also on
ours is website they've released a soft
velvet loose powder and eight shades and
also a new shade of many of their
existing products including a new sheer
lipstick a new velvet pressed powder and
Valley soft it's supposed to be for the
deepest neutral skin tones which is very
exciting they added to their I paint
collection with the shade Puerto finir
we
is a soft pale pink and a new eyeshadow
which is a soft shimmering pink peach
color called Valhalla and a new lip
gloss it is a seashell pink called Diane
I think I said that right i hope i did
coming in is another special report from
Vicky Urban Decay's vice limited edition
eyeshadow palette is going to be
re-releasing exclusively on altas
website on January 25th so keep your eye
out for that it doesn't say a time when
will be released so just keep it in that
refresh button if you want that palette
from special reporter Jessica we've
learned about the new elf skincare line
that's coming out and the strangest
promotion I think I've ever seen so what
you do is you go into the elf's website
and you pick out some skincare items
from their new line and you purchase
them they're all on pre-order elf is
going to release four of those items if
you put one of those for any of those
four in your shopping cart shopping cart
and purchase them then they will send
you them for free okay kind of makes me
want to buy some of skincare so I guess
it's probably pretty genius also from
Jessica the Anastasia Beverly Hills
liquid lipstick all those people to get
the promo Anastasio products they're
just blowing up with swatches and all
kinds of stuff so if you're interested
in those they're extremely extremely
bright like i was saying that's going to
be a big trend in the spring they're a
full coverage intense pigment matte
finish easy to apply liquid formula
according to Anastasia and those are
available in 20 shades moving on to
drugstore Knicks made a huge splash at
La IMATS giving out a goodie bag with
supposedly 300 products in each bag to
the guests of their party hollow most of
them are from their new spring line so
now people are taking pictures and
putting my friend Laura over mrs. Lowell
in whose provided these pictures for me
of some of the products that she got in
her goody bag so let's just talk about
this real quick destiny godley who has a
blog I copy some of her thoughts on the
new Nick's high voltage lipstick she's
that their creamy moisturizing more of a
bomb consistency she loves the color
choices there's a lot of those 90s
colors that are like the big rage right
now I don't know how that happens like
ie oh that's so out of date and all of a
sudden it's like the rage she said they
wear pretty well offers moisturizing as
they are but she says they do last
better if you have some kind of base
under them as far as the set she says
they have a baby soft hint of vanilla
she says she thinks it'll be all right
for people that are sensitive to smell
Nick's jumping on the hot lip of
bandwagon with those products and also
the intense butter glosses they're also
jumping on the contour bandwagon they
had the cream contour palette now
they're going to be coming out with a
powder contour palette called the
highlight and contour Pro palette

exciting that the best thing about this

almost makes you want to buy it except
for that they're hot pink they're crazy
Miley hot pink is what exactly what they
are there's a lip glass and then there's
a lipstick for the right person I think
