2017 let's get started with some top
industry news there are tons of ways to
apply foundation fingertips brushes
beauty sponges paddle brushes and most
recently introduced the USB silicone
sponge just when you thought you had
seen everything somebody thinks of
something new this time it is called the
EV blender the EV blender is a teardrop
shaped silicone applicator like the
silly sponge that does not absorb
foundation the difference is the blender
is textured for an airbrush finish

in the United States we've seen a recent
shift in mainstream media and brands
accepting makeup as genderless both
Maybelline and covergirl have recently
announced the male ambassadors for their
brands and shows like transparent and
orange is the new black are challenging
gender roles in ways never seen before
in Japan there is a new wave of men
bending gender norms they call
themselves Don see they wear makeup and
nail polish but don't regard themselves
as feminine they choose their cell based
on the concept of free will and doing
what one enjoys in order to be happy
model singer and dancer tramonto sake is
one of the leaders of the genderless
dawn see movement he feels women
appreciate men who are
more sensitive to beauty however tamam
says there is a downside as Japanese
mainstream society especially older
adults telling him that he should not
dress the way he does to tomorrow
however wearing makeup isn't about
sexuality but about fashion and making
himself feel beautiful nars has
announced their summer 2017
collaboration with British French
actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg
according to refinery29 details on the
18 piece collection are still secret but
