news this week Sephora has created an
accelerator program for female lead
Beauty startups the beauty retailer is
kicking off a new program this year
called Sephora accelerate which will put
10 early-stage startups through a boot
camp at its San Francisco headquarters
provide them with mentorship and give
them a stage to present at a demo day in
August they'll select the class of
participants by March the program is
part of Sephora as a larger social
impact agenda which includes Beauty
classes for women re-entering the
workforce or living in transitional
housing and shelters starting in April
and support for employees affected by
natural disasters are major life events
it is therefore requiring that its
startup applicants also have a socially
minded element in addition to a female
founder that could mean sourcing
sustainable materials or donating a
portion of revenue to charity the exact
impact will depend on the sort of
business at hand which can range from
brands producing physical beauty
