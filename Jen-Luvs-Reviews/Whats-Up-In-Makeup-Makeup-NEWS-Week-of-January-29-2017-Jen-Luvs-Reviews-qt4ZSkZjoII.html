are unsettled and makeup settles the
balance of the universe I'm Jen from
Genlis reviews and what's been makeup
starts now welcome to West and makeup
for January 29 2017 let's explore some
top industry news as we previously
reported a makeup artist of la de
Haggerty was in the process of
litigation against Kylie Jenner for
copying her photos to promote the Kylie
cosmetics line TMZ reports the two were
seemingly able to settle the dispute
without going to court in addition kylie
is posed to the original works on her
instagram giving credit to the ad vlada
mua account and to photographer julia
McKim pulling the works wonderful and
inspiring details of the actual
agreement remain under wraps in other
kylie news Kylie cosmetics will be
opening a pop-up shop in New York City
in February more details as they develop
and beware when purchasing any cosmetic
item from ebay or Facebook the central
crime branch of India has seized fake
cosmetics in a raid of a marketplace
these products will be tested for
ingredient analysis but are believed to
pose health risks and be harmful to the
skin products included perfumes hair
care body care and cosmetics speaking of
harmful things you can put on your face
Crayola has issued a statement warring
against melting crayons to use as
cosmetics the practice recently gained
some buzz on Instagram and controversy
ensued although our products are
non-toxic we do not recommend using them
to make eyeliner lipstick or other
makeup and strongly discourage their use
in this manner seta Crayola spokesperson
they are not designed tested or approved
for this use she sado has acquired the
app that will help you pick the perfect
foundation shade they are purchasing the
app match co which we reported on a
while back as you might recall the app
allows customers to scan their skin tone
and uses the data to blend a matching
personalized foundation the company will
remain in santa monica california but
become part of shisei toes global
makeup center for excellence shiseido
CEO masahiko otani says that new
partnerships will allow the cosmetics
giant offer its customers a more
personalized experience through
accelerated innovation in rapidly
evolving digital tools and customized
products Jacqueline Hill has been
teasing us for a few weeks now about
surprise upcoming collaboration and now
the guessing is over the new project set
for release sometime in March will be a
35 pan eyeshadow with who else but
morphe Jasmine says she's been working
on it for two years and had put her
heart and soul into this project she
wanted to make sure the formulas and
colors were absolutely perfect and she
wouldn't sign off on them until they
were she's been giving us glimpses of
the packaging and swatches on her
snapchat over the past few days but had
not fully shown me inside yet across the
pond in the UK a debate unfolded on a
morning show between two of the guests
it all stems from a statement by makeup
artist Charlotte Tilbury who was a
speaker at the bafta event earlier in
the week she stated women need make-up
to get ahead in life in their careers in
their personal lives whatever it is no
women should feel that they have to wear
makeup all that there are some help
disadvantaged professionally or in any
other way because they choose lots when
they cut like me it's never disadvantage
me there you wouldn't heart in later
love you wouldn't hire someone if they
weren't wearing makeup I think
unfortunately not by the end of the day
it is what it is this is a society that
we are dealing with we're not
reinventing the wheels we have to deal
with modern society and perceptions as
it is would you go into a meeting with
some viewers ridiculously high up in the
company without a face of makeup or
absolutely because it doesn't matter I
would far rather be judged on my
intelligence or the way that I speak
having hell on the way the icon of
course yes but you're going to be judged
on everything anyway hey Tara Gemma do
what makes them feel best and if you're
absolutely confidence I'm all for it I
have a general are you going to say to
them that they're going to be charged if
they don't wear makeup yeah because
that's upon my husband if they want to
wear in fine I don't think it's
important it shouldn't matter I would
far rather somebody walks away from the
conversation with me thinking what a
lovely person or what an intelligent
personal what now in this being the
Harrison not on her eyebrows all right
ladies we're going to sleep there
many viewers tweeted their opinions one
stated i hate the fact that we live in a
world where i looked at or even treated
differently because of what is or isn't
on my face another set i personally
wouldn't want to work for someone who
has more focus on my makeup ability than
my ability to do a job what do you think
let us know in the comments below beauty
blogger Yasim and Gaetti was tired of
hiding the fact that she had depression
and anxiety she didn't want to be
labeled as crazy but hiding it was
making everything worse for her so Katie
spoke out in a big and beautiful way she
painted half of her face with how she
was feeling on the inside and shared it
with her YouTube and Instagram followers
by creating the inside out challenge
daddy inspired others to share their
stories through the creativity with
makeup there was an overwhelmingly
positive reaction Katie stated it's
amazing to know you are not alone
there's a lot of comfort in that unity
she created the challenge to start a
conversation and she has done just that
inspiring others to spread awareness for
illnesses such as schizophrenia panic
disorders depression and anxiety now
here's a topic you don't see much on
what's up and make up Buddhist monks but
he is a very special Buddhist monk he is
also a celebrity makeup artist koto
nishimura is started doing makeup
professionally after he realized how
much joy makeup could bring to others
he's worked the Miss Universe pageant as
well as numerous fashion shows after
completing his Buddhist training in 2015
nishimura participated in the out in
Japan project the purpose of the project
is to spotlight prominent members of the
Japanese LGBTQ community more recently
he has been giving back by offering free
makeup lessons to transgender women and
others who are interested in learning
about makeup application nishimura
stated as a Buddhist monk I want
everyone to live happily and in harmony
I believe makeup is one of the tools to
make yourself happy and if you're happy
it becomes easier to be kind to others I
don't know anyone who wouldn't agree
