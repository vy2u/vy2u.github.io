hello my friends this is jenna from
Genlis reviews and you were watching
what's up in makeup thanks so much for
tuning in this week there are so many
products this week we're actually going
to film two episodes for you one is
going to be drugstore only that is going
to air tomorrow at nine-thirty a.m.
eastern time with all of the drugstore
releases because there are so many
everything else is going to be in the
show today so let's go ahead and jump
right into the top industry news of the
week and that comes from some
legislation that we are applauding the
tiny micro plastic microbeads using many
facial scrubs and other products are
being banned in the United States
President Obama has recently signed a
federal law that will ban their
manufacture starting in 2017 one bottle
of face Washington's contain as many as
300,000 microbeads and around 300 tons
are released into our waters each year
they then go into the water systems and
wreak havoc and if you're wondering why
how do they get into the water system
it's because they're so tiny they can't
be filtered by sanitation systems so not
only do they mess up the systems they
also can be eaten by fish and in turn
eaten by us because they don't break
down in the water so in a future episode
we'll examine some replacement products
that you might want to try but for now
we should be happy we got a good thing
going on even though it's only in 2017
but at least at least legislation has
been passed now let's get into some
