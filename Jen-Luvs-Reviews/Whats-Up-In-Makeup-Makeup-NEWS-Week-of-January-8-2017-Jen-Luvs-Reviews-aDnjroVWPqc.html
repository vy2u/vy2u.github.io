lashes and what is Kim getting made up
now I'm Jen from Genlis reviews and
what's up in makeup starts now welcome
to whatsapp and makeup for January
eighth 2017 happy new year to you hope
you had a fantastic holiday season now
let's look at some top industry news
Maybelline is picked two spokespeople
for their new colossal Big Shot mascara
and they may look familiar makeup Shayla
and Manny mua the two shot a theatrical
ad for the new product throwing a golden
case full of mascara onto a bed before
getting bossed up for a big night out
Manny is Maybelline's first male
spokesperson according to bustle
anne-marie Nelson boggle senior vice
president of marketing at maybelline new
york stated Manny and Shayla represented
the boss Beauty attitude in this mascara
campaign like no one else could bringing
to life this message on screen to
inspire their millions of fans as they
do on a daily basis to also lash like a
boss Revlon also has a new ambassador
and it's Gwen Stefani when invites us
all to join in making 2017 the year of
love does this woman ever age you may
remember a big recall back in 2007 of
toys manufactured in China due to the
dangers of lead the lead is a natural
element it has been found to be toxic to
almost all human organs and especially
dangerous to the brain development of
children the US Food and Drug
Administration and recently released a
statement expressing their concerns
regarding lead content in makeup
surprisingly cosmetics and their
ingredients do not have to be approved
by the FDA in order to be marketed and
sold the only exception being color
additives because the FDA cannot enforce
an exact limit on the amount of lead
used in cosmetics they have suggested
that no more than 10 parts per million
be contained in any cosmetic product the
fda tested hundreds of products for
traces of lead they confirm that
although most cosmetics on the market in
the united states generally already
contain less than 10 ppm of lead
small number contained higher amounts if
you are concerned about lead in your
cosmetic products safe cosmetics org
suggest you email call or write to
companies and tell them that lead free
products are important to you cut back
on reapplying make up through the day
and finally keep all makeup out of the
reach of children and finally we all
know celebrities like to get gussied up
in expensive ball gowns with full hair
and makeup before heading to an event
like the VMAs Kim Kardashian took things
a step further of course as evidenced by
these photos with her makeup artist
