can't believe it's over news
subscription box lovers got a blow this
week as Birchbox announce the change to
their point system Birchbox is known for
having the best point system in all of
subscription boxes but founder Katia
Beauchamp says that it just isn't
sustainable the reviewing products each
month subscribers could earn up to five
dollars back to our purchases and birch
boxes online or brick and mortar shops
this means this is a subscriber could
earn up to sixty dollars per year
here just for reviewing products in a
statement to the consumerist Birchbox
wrote we found that many people were
leaving reviews without having tried the
sample first so beginning july eleventh
we will only be offering points for the
first five reviews that our customers
right in essence Birchbox was paying a
high dollar amount to subscribers for
reviews of products but the reviews were
not of high quality because of this
after july eleventh Bartok's subscribers
will only have an opportunity to earn
five more dollars toward the birchbark
shop through the reviewing process
Birchbox points however are not gone
entirely you will still be able to earn
points by referring new customers as
well as through purchasing products from
their shop two more elements are
changing first you can now spend points
in one dollar increments instead of ten
dollar increments and on a less happy
note points will expire in six months
rather than one year Birchbox
subscribers are threatening to spend
their points and ditch out with Birchbox
already laying all fifteen percent of
their employees and cancelling
operations in canada could this be the
end of the original beauty subscription
or will they step up their game so much
because they want you to stay a
subscriber only time will tell and house
