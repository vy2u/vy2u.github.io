a lot of things from SE
this week I found all of these on the
Ulta website as he has a couple of kits
one is called the silk watercolor swept
away nail look kit the description looks
very very ordinary but if you look at
the box it looks anything but ordinary
they've got this crazy watercolor
looking swatch up in the corner I don't
know what is going on with this kit I
wish ulta would describe it a little bit
better but it looks really really cool
you can see that it's got all the
primary colors there which makes me
think that you can really mix these
colors together to make some custom
shades so I would really like to know
more about this I wish also did a better
job describing it there's also another
kit called the silk watercolor abstract
floral nail look kit again the
description looks very ordinary but if
you look at the swatch up in the corner
it looks beautiful so I'm really curious
about these kits I hope that I can see
some reviews soon because they're so
neat looking also se has released the

instagram thank you so much for your
help this week I could not have done it
without you and as typical we are going
to have the what's up in makeup chat
this morning from ten a.m. eastern time
to a 11 a.m. eastern time even though
its father today we are going to go
ahead and go for it and but I gotta cut
it off at eleven because I gotta go
spend time with the husband and the
kiddos also an update on the what's up
and make of app the creator of the app
has told me that the Android version
should be available sometime in July
let's cross our fingers just a reminder
I have basically this much control over
how the app is designed it's all up to
the Creator so I will put in all of your
suggestions on what we should be doing
with the app but I have no personal
control over anything as I did not
purchase the app it was offered to me so
please be patient with me with the app
and as far as the features and how they
all work I am putting in your
suggestions but there's only so much
that I control but I am having so much
fun using the app with you guys we are
developing such a wonderful community
over there I believe there's about 700
of us over there right now and I hope
there will be more people contributing
one thing I love about it so far is it's
such a safe place to upload your photos
of your nails of the day your faces of
the day it's not like Instagram where
you're competing with a bunch of
professionals we're just regular people
where imperfections are embraced and
appreciated we just care about learning
about new products from each other and
developing such a wonderful community
over there so thank you to the 700 or so
of you that have download the app
without you there is no community so I
thank you all so much for being a part
of it and those of you that are waiting
for Android it's coming as fast as he
can get it to come so hopefully soon
we'll even we'll probably end up
doubling those numbers at least once the
Android release has been released
because that's what happens with
releases they are released as far as new
products that i want to show you how to
request to show you some new products
unfortunately I can't show you products
that were in this week's episode because
they're brand new this week but I do
want to show you just the preview of
some of the elf products that I got I
got the new elf I shadow palettes I got
all of them i also got the contour and
bronzing kit girlfriend this is the one
I'm wearing on my eyes today oh my
goodness honestly these are awesome I am
so excited this shade is a total bust
but oh my gosh just are you kidding me
elf are you kidding me the nude one is
amazing those are the two of you so far
I'm going to be doing a full review on
all of these products as far as just a
preview of the contour kit I feel like
this is kind of versatile for a lot of
skin tones this highlight shade is my
exact skin tone so this will be better
for medium skin tones the highlight of
course is good for anyone I feel like
these are better for medium to lighter
skin tone so that's the that's the
contour kit and then here's the bronzer
kit overall just absolutely loving these
products I mean I just I can't believe
how pigmented they are how easy they are
to use if I had
pick between the bronzer palette and the
contour palette I would probably pick
the contour palette but the bronzer
palette is really nice as well I don't
think that you need both I think that
one or the other is going to be fine but
again I am going to be doing a full
review of all these pallets once I've
tried them all but I figured I would
just kind of give you a little bit of a
preview of what I've used so far oh the
other thing that I where is it this year
this is the the color-changing lipstick
don't don't waste your money in my
opinion it dried my lips out something
terrible the color-changing aspect is
kind of cool but unless you plan on
keeping reapplying this all day long
like every hour I would not recommend
the got a glow lip tint at all but again
full review coming soon so as our a word
for watching this video all the way the
end you get that little elf previous I
thank you so much for watching you were
awesome mad love and I will see you in
the next video bye Wendy and she is the
