hello my friends this is Jen from Jen
Lowe's reviews and you are watching
what's up in makeup biggest top news of
the week it was splattered all over the
Internet Urban Decay is coming out with
a new Naked palette it is called The
Naked smoked palette which to me is kind
of a little bit of an oxymoron and that
when you do a smoky eye it's not really
naked but maybe you can make it a little
more naked with this palette I don't
know who am I to judge
beauty bloggers and vloggers were given
promotional palettes for this launch so
you can find swatches and reviews all
over you too all you gotta do is search
for them to see what that palette is
like release date is July 8th on Urban
Decay dot-com and I believe also at Ulta
shades in this palette include warm
bronzes dimensional grays rich Browns
topes and deep blacks Too Faced is
coming up with some new products on June
15th including their Born This Way
Foundation and love flush blushes the
foundation is described as a medium to
full coverage with a barely-there finish
and the blushes have a candy smell and a
satin finish there may be more products
released on the 15th but as of now these
are the only ones that have been
announced there also are some you know
different conflicting things about
whether the blushes are coming out on
the 15th and whether they're not so
we'll have to wait till the 15th to find
out officially lorac has come out with a
Pro Plus a fiber mascara that it's
available only at Kohl's for the time
being
they say it's a buildable volumizing and
lengthening mascara in Sephora news bite
Beauty came out with their lip lab for
the month of June on June 3rd and it was
called because of course they sell out
in like 15 minutes it was called mango
daiquiri and it was a tangy coral rose
YSL has two priming products that are
brand new to Sephora one is the Touche
Eclat blur Perfector it's $55 and
transforms from a balm to a powder upon
application to soften the skins
imperfections creating a transparent yet
subtle rosy glow effect and then also
the Touche
blur primer for $52 it blurs
imperfections and boosts radiance with a
subtle golden shimmer which is kind of
interesting for a primer to put golden
shimmer all over your face
but maybe it's really subtle we'll have
to see some reviews to find out about
that Besame Cosmetics has a very
interesting product it's called the
classic color lip matches and there are
only $6 these vintage reproduction Reds
are the exact shades used by best left
Hollywood starlets back in 1920 they're
encased in a vintage Mac matchbook
packed with five original Besame red lip
shades from 1920 they're perfect for
on-the-go touch-ups you get 5.0 3 ounce
lipsticks in the Besame red the
full-size lipstick is $22 for 0.12
ounces so getting that much product
really is a fantastic deal it's just the
format of it is a little bit less
convenient than in the actual tube
there's a new brand that I've never
heard of at Sephora but I figured I
would mention it to you in case you have
heard of it it's called will go with
Amuro miksa they have a mineral text
touch concealer it's $65 for this
concealer if you can get it in ivory or
beige it treats the skin while vitamin C
and E correct skin tone and support
collagen production C on say London came
out with a ton of new makeup products
this week including the bikini body balm
illuminizer for $29 the bamboo bronzer a
long wear bronzing powder for $28 there
are two possible shades in this one is a
little lighter of course some one is a
little bit darker Ciotti has also come
out with precious metal eyes shadow duos
but don't be fooled because one of the
duo's is a primer and then you get a
shadow with it you're supposed to
perfect and prime your lids with the eye
primer which smoothes and perfects Liz
to create the perfect eye shadow base
and then sweep on the shadow pact with
pearl pigments then impart a silky
smooth and gleaming liquid metal finish
with long lasting results the primer
seems to be the same shade in all four
of the duo is available the duo's are
$28 each ciate also came out with the
lip-locked tint and balm duo there are
two shades in berry and fuchsia it's a
semi matte lip tint for highly pigmented
buildable color
that lasts is what they say the tinted
balm is infused with shea butter for a
soft sheer finish the next two products
are nail products which is what they are
more known for the first is the
monochrome manicure you get 2 full-size
nail polishes in a black shade and a
white shade it also comes with stencil
designs that allow you to create
negative space manicures in monochrome
shades that negative space stuff is all
over Pinterest and Instagram
super super popular right now so I'm not
surprised as yatza has come out with
some way for us to create this look
easily at home also the South Beach
socialite collection it's a four piece
polished set featuring two rose gold
shades with glitter and foil finishes a
white polish and a top coat now onto a

long but it's now on sale down from $52
- $39 it is a 100 $21 value you get both
the beautifully bronzed palette and the
gorgeously glowing palette each palette
comes with three eyeshadows and one
comes with two blushes the other comes
with two Blanc
bronzers and each one comes with a lip
gloss so that's a really fantastic deal
if you're a bareMinerals fan it also
news most exciting for me because I'm a
huge Z palette fan z palettes are now at
Ulta they have all different sizes range
from $14 for the small to $45 for the
double-sided palette what you do is you
put metal stickers on the back of
depotted eyeshadows or blushes or any
kind of product it comes in a pan and
then you stick it inside your Z palette
so that you can kind of consolidate your
makeup collection each palette comes
some of the stickers in case your deep
potted pans are not magnetic but then
you can also buy additional magnetic
stickers if you need more and it's just
a great way to organize a larger makeup
collection if you have lots of drugstore
little drugstore palettes you want to
deposit them there's tons of videos on
YouTube on how to do that and then you
just stick them all in the Z palette so
you can keep them all in one place so
I'm really excited to see those at Ulta
also at Ulta this week clarence has an
online-only multi blush cream blush and
it's $30 it comes in three shades they
say it glides on the cheeks with the
ease of a cream and transforms into a
powder with the heat of your skin also
the instant lip light balm Perfector for
$23 this one is also online only
it moisturizes plumps and illuminates
the lips and it comes in five shades
next the instant light lip Perfector for
$24 this is also online only it comes in
three shades it's a melting gel with a
deliciously sweet flavor and 3d shimmer
for luscious smooth shiny lips and a
natural colored luminous smile and then
finally a bronzing duo for $36 it comes
in three shades and again this is on
line only in Mac news nothing brand new
that came out this week but they have
announced a new collaboration with
singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding in
December you're gonna look first a lot
of peaches and nudes in this collection
it seems like an odd color choice for
December but with the sleek packaging
and the relatively universal appeal of
those types of shades I'm sure it will
sell well and QVC news there's going to
be two of very interesting TSVs this
week or today's special values the first

hombre special effect nail color it

technique in order to create the ombre

nail one from half up and then one just
on the tip so that it looks more
gradient and gradient 'add gradiated i
don't know so you get that gradient
effect from the base of your nail all
the way to the tip I'm curious to see
how that looks when people start trying
to do that look I hope that it works
also Maybelline has the new baby lip lip
glosses Krista at my monthly obsession
tells us on her Instagram that she is
not impressed with these unfortunately
she purchased them at Walmart for a
little less than $4 though she liked
that they were non sticky and
comfortable the pigmentation was
non-existent in the two lighter shades
and she describes the smell as like soap
exclamation point exclamation point
exclamation point which is not a good
thing a user commenting on her post
mentioned that they smell like Froot
Loops Froot Loops soap is this a good
thing
I don't know I I might pass on these
these don't sound like they're for me
and you're fortunate enough to attend
generation Beauty in LA you may have
gotten a chance to buy some of the new
NYX liquid suede lipsticks they're set
to release sometime this month but no
official release date has been announced
in an T news geek chic Cosmetics has

to go with her hair color pop is
releasing another collaboration with
coffee break with Danny it is called the
metamorphosis collection these shades in
it are hope kindness bravery and
strength I couldn't find it on the

of it maybe it's legit I don't know it
is an eye contour cream and a wrinkle a
retouch wrinkle and pore filler okay now
we know skincare products can be
expensive but the retail price for these
two products is one thousand three
hundred ninety nine dollars and ninety
eight cents but only thing social they
have it for 69
dollars and 99 cents that's quite a
price reduction what is this stuff made
out of and and what what this is what
are you kidding me I personally have
never seen skin care for that expensive
but maybe there's things that Nicole and
I just don't know if you know anything
about this and you have insight into
this product please let us know because
right now we're just laughing at the
fact that they're they're making this be
$1400 for a retail price that just seems
just outrageous and silly because here's

set you get five shimmer eyeshadows one

little more realistically price Estee
Lauder has the expert color palette for
eyes and face the original price is
