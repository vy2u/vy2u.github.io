this is jen from Jen loves reviews and
you are watching what's up and makeup
starting off this show with the biggest
fail well not the biggest fail in the
rock history but maybe the second
biggest fail in rock history behind the
mega Pro release the resort's Iron Sheik
palette limited edition nordstrom
exclusive 185 dollar value for twenty
dollars is now sold out there is a 1
comment underneath the palette and an
it's from at morale from miami florida
and let me read it to you the lorac
resort call it sold out online although
i had it in my cart ugh anyways will the
power be back in stock any time in the
future or not in addition is this
specific resort palette avail but
Nordstrom's brick-and-mortar shores
thank you here's the response hello
Admiral I'm sorry to hear that it
doesn't look like we will be restocking
them on our website as it's a limited
edition palette also it's not available
in any of our shores however however
you're more than welcome to join us via
live chat and we'll be happy to suggest
similar pallets the poor woman had it in
her cart and it sold out while it was in
her cart I don't know how many they had
but apparently not enough another fail
from lorac on to happier things to face
has now released something called the
selfie powders and I think this is one
of the most creative releases that I
have seen recently they're called it's
called light fragmenting technology and
they say it's used to brighten bronze
and illuminate the skin how cute is that
packaging oh my goodness it's like
Instagram II like that is so this thing
and adorable I'm a little confused about
the blue powder I guess it's some kind
of illuminating redness cancelling kinds
of powder I cannot wait to see somebody
use it also the NARS dual intensity
blushes that I was so super pumped up
about last week are releasing this week
on march forth so excited o glorious
like that's the kind of make
that gives me chills all right update
from Emily inside Sephora on the
bareMinerals ready eight point o powder
neutral eyeshadow palettes there are
three pallets available in store right
now each comes with eight shadows and a
mini brush she says that they are very
soft and easy to blend but for better
color payoff she does suggest you use a
primer the mats are beautiful however
the shimmers can be a little obnoxious
for people that aren't used to wearing
shimmer also she want to let you know
that the end of next week 8 exclusive
contour kits are going to be released in
store in Sephora these are all ones that
have been released on the website she
doesn't have the whole list she says
that right now they do have the Too
Faced cocoa contour chisel perfection
kit in stock in her store but they're
also going to get the brand-new stila
shape and shade custom contoured duo
which was told to me on last video by
stephanie lord thank you stephanie for
the heads up on that steel a palette it
looks awesome and also the Kevin a quan
contour book is going to be part of that
the bare minerals care of California
bronze multi-effect bronzing trio and
also the Kat Von D shade and light
contour palette all of those are going
to be spotlighted at the stores a lot of
the stores are going be holding contour
classes for beauty insiders so if you're
interested in that you can call your
Sephora store or check online for class
schedules for that so very very exciting
at Sephora online there really wasn't a
whole lot going on except for a lot of
the try it kit I noticed that an Ulta
online as well this week a lot of the
ones where they have like a lot of
little sample so that you can try things
or just a selection of full-size items
so sila has released the floral fixation
lip glaze trio there are three lip
glosses in see show which is a rose pink
hibiscus which is a sparkling mall and
tropical punch which is a purple orchid
color also buxom came out with a lip set
called lips say it all for eighteen
dollars with a mini full-bodied lipstick
in hooligan which is a mauve plum and a
mini full-body lip gloss in dolly which
is a shimmering sultry move then of the
cosmetics came out with a sampler set
called cheek me out it comes with a mini
Posey tinted lip and cheek stain and
be pink and a mini high beam and that's
like a liquid highlighter Collini came
out with a lip set as well called kiss
me honey and at seventeen dollars get a
little chubby stick in a richer raisin
and almost lipstick in black honey and a
superbomb moisturizing gloss in black
honey in full size products at Sephora
stila has come out with a new line you
know I'm not shirking call the lines
only three lipsticks it's the nude
interlude color bomb lipsticks there's
three different ones in a light a medium
and a dark and if you look at that
packaging does that kind of look like
the Urban Decay Naked lip glosses it's
they're really really pretty two
different foundation kinds of things the
Clinique came out with an acne solutions
BB cream with SPF 40 there are five
shades from light to deep girl on
released a new sheer foundation called
baby glow there are three shades only in
light medium and golden there's an
excellent blog post that I'm going a
link below that shows you the three
different colors just be aware that the
golden is not very dark it looks like
almost like a light light medium and
medium rather than any kind of darker
shade they're pretty pretty light but
definitely click on that blog post if
you're curious it's also quite amusing
and the way that she words her review of
it the product says it's a light
revealing sheer makeup foundation with
SPF 25 and it's even your skin tone
refreshes and created creates a youthful
looking complexion isn't that nice girl
on also released this week two different
palettes there's a four color palette
and a six color palette finally Laura
Mercier released a flawless skin
infusion de rose nourishing oil and they
say it's a lightweight restorative blend
of skin conditioning super oils then
infuse the skin with nutrients while
balancing out moisture like I just want
to hear birds chirping in the background
all of that but if you look at the
ingredients you'll notice that the first
ingredients are sunflower seed oil
safflower seed oil and very close behind
that vegetable oil and soybean oil so
you might want to just go to the grocery
store and mix some of those together and
you might get a similar product but it
won't come in
that gorgeous packaging there are some
other oils in there including rosehip
oil and macadamia oil but the primary
oils are actually oils you can find in
your grocery stores but it is a new
laura mercier oil that i did want to
mention to you in high-end news this
week just one highlight from Chanel the
lesson temporals deschanel collection

eyeshadow palette that is limited
edition includes five eyeshadows and
it's embossed with a leather braided
chain looking like her bags the colors
range from black to define the eye to
green and plum colors to enhance and a
silver white gold tones to highlight
your eyes so there is that it looks like
it would be hard to create a look with
that but if you're really talented maybe
also they've released a silver nail
color as well that is also limited
edition speaking of very expensive stuff
