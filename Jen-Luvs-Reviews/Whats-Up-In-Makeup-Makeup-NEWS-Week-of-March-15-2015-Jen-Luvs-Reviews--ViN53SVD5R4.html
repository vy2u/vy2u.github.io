reviews and you are watching what's up
and make up happy belated pi day I know
that has nothing to do with makeup I
just wanted to wear my new shirt most
exciting news in makeup this week is the
Ulta 21 days of beauty that starts today
I'm going to take out my handy-dandy
ulta catalog and tell you what's coming
up alright so today we're talking about
bare minerals and philosophy today

all-over face color and blush fifty
percent off it is ten dollars you're
also going to be able to get the
philosophy micro delivery exfoliators

going to tell you all of them but i will
tell you what's going on the rest of the
week just as far as brands march 16th
perricone md and stila March seventeenth
tart and Murad on the 18th clinique
exuviance and a pur minerals on the 19th
it brushes for alta dermalogica and
Lancome on the 20th clarisonic it
cosmetics and Smashbox and finally on
the 21st bare minerals benefit
clarisonic philosophy at Urban Decay for
more information on the specific deals
from those brands go to ulta.com ha love
21 days of beauty the only about twenty
one days of beauty is that you gotta
jump on it fast because it sells out if
you try to go to the store you got to
get there right when it opens they sell
it super fast with all of these deals
speaking of alta will go to the
drugstore side of ulta Neutrogena came
out with a new noshing a long wear
eyeshadow there are six new quads they
are ten dollars each they have a
built-in primer to help prevent smudging
and creasing and also they claim that it
has a 12 hour we're now rimmel london i
am a little confused on what rebels
doing okay i don't remember a specific
spring line they've come out with yet
but they have release of some products
and their reproduction the scandalized
Kate Moss mascara was released I believe
in the UK and Australia but is now
available in us stores it's 699 they
have it in three
Shane's three shades four shades jet
black sapphire emerald and amethyst also
the kate moss eyeshadow stick which also
was in seems to pippin in the UK and
also in Australia it's 499 there's four
shades rose gold deep amethyst electric
sapphire and something called purple
turquoise which seems like a complete
oxymoron to me it looks more like a
turquoise but they can do what they want
it's their brand right finally Rimmel is
doing some reap remotes they have their
glam eyes HD eyeshadow I don't really
know the history of this eyeshadow I do
know that it used to look like that
Union Jack symbol but now they're going
back to this other kind I have seen some
people review this kind but it was like
a year ago so I'm a bit confused on it
but just so you know ulta says that
they're new and therefore 99 each and I
there's four choices available rimo has
also repackaged their match perfect BB
cream at 699 it comes in three shades
Kardashian beauty has a new eyebrow
tamer it comes in clear and brown for
ten dollars and finally two more things
one little combo from it cosmetics hello
lash extensions mascara plus the note
tug gel eyeliner are now going to be
able to be bought together for twenty
four dollars which is significant
discount if you were curious about those
products and then Real Techniques has a
new limited edition three brush set it's
called a sculpting kit comes with a
sculpting brush a fan brush and a
setting brush for twenty dollars and
they are part of the regular line not
that high end metallics line in Sephora
news Kat Von D has a new palette that
she's coming out with so excited it goes
along with the shade and like contour
kit I that's for your face and now she's
got the contour I palette she put it up
on her Instagram and probably other
social media and it looks totally
amazing in a little less happy news
let's talk about Anastasia or honest
asya Beverly Hills however you want to
say it they came out with something
called the brow bar to go it's sixteen
dollars it comes with a mini tweezers a
mini
brow wiz and a mini clear brow gel now
that costs sixteen dollars but if you
break down how much your product you're
getting you're only getting twelve
dollars worth of products so you're
really paying to try everything that's
getting horrible reviews on sephora.com
mostly because of the brow is being such
a small minuscule amount people are
saying it's only even just a couple of
applications so i posted on my instagram
earlier this week i was doing the
calculations for that if you were to buy
1 ounce of product for the Anastasia
brow Wiz it would cost you seven
thousand dollars talk about overpriced
holi moli but anyway people are really
upset about this product so just before
Warren another semi fail from urban
decay they have on the Sephora website
something called a shadow box it's $34
it says that its new it was released at
Ulta calm back in September nine of them
are pre released and three are brand new
shades temptalia.com says that the
shadows that our permanent seemed to be
a different formula than previously
released she does have some swatches on
her blog but she definitely says you
should swatch it before you buy it what
is up with these makeup companies I
don't know let's get into some more new
releases one from hourglass the
panoramic long wear lip liner has been
released in two new shades called canvas
and ballet Rochelle from glam mom says
that these are amazing and wear
beautifully on the lips through the day
Laura Mercier has come out with a silk
cream moisturizing photo edition
foundation for forty-eight dollars it's
available in shape 12 shades and is now
oil-free woohoo for those of you that
oil does not do well on your skin
supposedly it has a 12 hour where it is
very moisturizing and it is a long wear
formula that supposedly blends very
seamlessly into your skin I don't really
talk about skin care products on what's
up in makeup but are inside Sephora
reporter Rochelle told me I have to
mention this and it is the glam glow
youth cleanse daily exfoliating cleanser
she said if you are a glam glow mask fan
this
is a must-have it's five times more
product and almost half the price it is
a mask and cleanser and one and she
absolutely loves it it is a mud to foam
formula givenchy I think I'm saying that
right has a new waterproof mascara
called the Phenom eyes and it's $31 it
does come in black and blue Make Up For
Ever has also released a new mascara
called the smoky stretch lengthening and
defining mascara Becca has also released
a new product that is very intriguing it
is a limited edition shimmering skin
Perfector pressed it only comes in one
shade and that is called blush copper is
a warm copper infused with a rose
gold-tone last week Smashbox released a
collaboration of lipsticks with a man
named Donald Robinson who is an
Instagram artist this week they're
coming out with another product from
that line it is the photo angle pure
pigment gel liner its twenty four
dollars and it comes in six shades this
is the quote from the website I take
anywhere pen with a unique flexible tip
that combines the intensity of a gel
with the creativity of a magic marker
for smooth line every time clinique also
released a very hyped up acne solutions
BB cream in broad spectrum SPF 40 it is
thirty seven dollars and it comes in
five shades finally one more thing from
rachelle inside Sephora she wanted to
give us an update on the Murad rapid
collagen infusion for lips that we
reported on she says the clients are
just dying over this product so if
you're curious about it I definitely
suggest going into sephora and checking
it out this week in Mac news the hot and
naughty collection has just been
released to go along with the Haute and
naughty lash and Haute and naughty to
blacklash mascaras with the new
waterproof formula and a fresh brown
shade they may wear brown mascara I
don't know there are some new pigments
in vanilla grape and fuchsia also fluid
lines and the colors black track and
macro violet which I think were the two
from the Cinderella collection I don't
think those are new I don't know but
they're saying that they're new with
this collection i I don't know people
read promotes and ah
it's all so confusing something i don't
know that is new from mac is the mac and
nordstrom naturals eyeshadow palette for
spring of 2015 this is $85 it is limited
edition but what they did was they just
took a lot of their very very popular
neutral shades and they just pop them
into this palette for you they're almost
like try it's for mac eyeshadows I think
they're a little bit smaller than the
traditional pans but it's just a way to
try all those shades that you've always
heard about and always wanted to try but
never wanted to pay full price for so
you get 15 eyeshadows including all that
glitters wedge SAT satin taupe rice
paper wood winked Omega beauty mark
carbon those are ones that I know I hear
all the time and and a few more so very
exciting about that if you're new to mac
eyeshadow or want to start exploring mac
eyeshadows in natural news love for
humanity has a new supernatural face
cream as well as an ultra silky cleanser
um aroma and company has a limited
edition pure love kit which comes with a
rose tony mist and a glow karat rose
serum and then red apple lipstick has an
eye shadow single called endpoint which
is 1875 whoo but then they also have a
sale going on it's fifteen percent off
of brown eyeshadow select brushes and
empty pallets that you can stick your
singles in it high and news napoleon
perdis came out with a nude nude oh I
knew it say you with a little ' nude up
I nude I don't know even how to say that
nude you I chicken brow palette it is
absolutely gorgeous a lot of lighter
shades though but they do look very
pretty if you have a very light skin
tone or if you have a deeper skin tone
and we're just looking for some lighter
shades to brighten up your look giorgio
armani finally released the maharaja
collection for spring of 2015 it is
inspired by the delicate beauty and
lively saturated colors of indian
embroideries and they really didn't get
