spawns a new cosmetics vision and
chipmunks love mascara brushes find out
why I'm Jen from Jen Lowe's reviews and
what to the makeup starts now welcome to
what's up and makeup for March 19th 2017
let's get started with the top industry
news are you a fan of Kat Von D products
then we've got some news for you so get
excited for these upcoming spring
releases you most likely already know
about the rock candy 6 piece set
featuring newly improved studded kiss
formulas and six new stunningly bright
shades coming to Sephora $45 we
consistently sold out studded kiss
lipstick shade and lovecraft available
in the everlasting liquid lipstick
formula this is coming in spring to
Sephora newly formulated unlock it
makeup remover wipes and the matte
version of the tattoo liner coming soon
as if those weren't enough to swoon over
watch for these the mother mini lip set
in both the everlasting liquid and the
new studded kiss version for $19 in
April a new 24-hour wearing cream that
most are assuming is a cream version of
the ever popular shade and light contour
palette new silver shimmering shadow
that will have a foil running for the
hills and the latest peak everlasting
lip liner coming in on April 11th to
Sephora calm which ones will you be
getting let us know in the comments
below the cosmetic industry is packed
full of products but to a woman of color
and may seem very sparse when trying to
find your correct shade especially when
doing so online good news and Ivy League
trained attorney named Kimberly Smith
has stepped into the game to change that
she travelled around the world in search
of products for women of color and in
February created marjaan e beauty
company here's a look at six of their
products
AJ Crimson in dutty wine $22 marina
Beauty let aunt taru $40 true Moringa
rejuvenating body polish $29 afro Diddy
Jillette Caribbean coconut hair
treatment masque $18
read love beauty pure fractionated
coconut oil $17.50 and liquid courage a
liquid matte lipstick $19.99 will have
their website on our where to buy page
at what's up a makeup calm now for just
a moment imagine a world with two Modern
Renaissance palates could this be
possible is there room for another could
another possibly be as amazing as the
first a live chat conducted by Sephora
last week with daughter of the company
namesake and president of Anastacio
Beverly Hills Claudius or revealed that
another product like the modern
Renaissance is in the works for fall of
2017 when asked directly if she plans to
release a second modern renaissance
palette source stated I believe I
created her twin she's a little
different but they are related
nonetheless she also gave a bit more
information on the upcoming palette by
saying everything i put out has a part
of me in it modern renaissance
definitely has shades that our holy
grail for me and our next palette will
include holy grail shades as well so
known as noir vina on social media has
tweeted several times about the new
palette suggesting that it will come in
a similar shape and size but will not
have the modern renaissance in its name
and that it will be the spicy sister
when asked about this a source stated if
modern Renaissance is day her sister
palette is night and now the four to
five month wait begins in a world full
of beauty standards that most people
cannot possibly live up to it's
refreshing when we see that even
celebrities are just normal everyday
people with the same struggles as us
what makes it even better is when you
see or hear one of them embracing their
own imperfections as well as inspiring
and encouraging others to do the same
this is exactly what star lee smith is
doing alongside her brother and sister
star lee formed the band the Atomics
which rocked last month's dolce gabbana
runway show
but trolls had to point out that
Charlie's acne was visible during the
show Starly took to social media and
posted a no filter no makeup selfie
stating who cares if you have acne
you are beautiful she wrote a love note
to myself and other struggling we all
have imperfections and it's time we
start embracing them instead of letting
the world tell us we need to hide them
kudos the star leaf we're showing the
hater that imperfections are more
beautiful than perfection
Nikhil's makeup is an art and it's
especially wondrous when an artist will
collab enter jean-michel basquiat who is
known for vibrant combinations of
symbols and texts along with commentary
on society and race the collection will
contain twelve Basquiat inspired
products each product will have a name
and colors that are drawn from the
artist's work they'll be a blush and
bronzer palette three lipsticks of which
two are named abstract and exhibition
two eyeshadow palettes and of course the
classic UD eye pencils in red yellow and
blue that will be designed to look like
art pencils as well as accompanying
cosmetic bags all product packaging will
feature Basquiat artwork and range in
price from seventeen dollars to thirty
nine dollars each or purchased as a
complete fault for a $165 stay tuned for
more information as it becomes available
and finally how many mascaras have you
collected 110 more with that said have
you ever wondered if there were any
really good uses for old wands what if
you could use them to help out a furry
friends would you be willing to clean
pack and ship your old mascara wands
offer a good use
if so listen up evolution Wildlife
Refuge in North Carolina wants you to do
just that in a Facebook post last week
it was revealed that the old warrants
from mascaras are used to remove fly
eggs and larvae from animal fur it left
on the animal then nasty little critters
can cause infections and skin irritation
the wands are great for this job due to
their closely packed bristles so the
next time you're about to pitch that
used up mascara in the trash take a
moment to consider how you and that wand
can aid an animal in need wash it up
pack it up ship it off for more
