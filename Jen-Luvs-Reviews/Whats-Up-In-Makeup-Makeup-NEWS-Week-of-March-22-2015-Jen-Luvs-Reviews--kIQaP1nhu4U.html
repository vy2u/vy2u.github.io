reviews and you are watching what's up
in makeup biggest news at least the one
that I'm most excited about this week is
the Too Faced summer collection for 2015
along with the selfie powders the
contour palette and the natural matte
palette that we have covered in previous
weeks of what's up in makeup they have
now added the highly-anticipated melted
liquefied long wear lipsticks that are
the metallic shades so so excited
they're called melted metal and
supposedly they are liquefied metallic
lipstick in a tube and this is what it
says on the site we've taken a the 90s
field statement lip and reinvented it
with the lustrous look of liquefied
metal there are eight new shades in that
little line from Too Faced also to face
has released the little black book of
bronzers for forty nine dollars you get
the chocolate Soleil the milk chocolate
Soleil the brand new dark chocolate
Soleil bronzer snow bunny pink leopard
beach bunny endless summer and the
original Sun bunny bronzer for that $49
price tag now I compared those to the
full sizes so you would know whether
you're getting your value so if you get
each one of those individually there are
thirty dollars a piece of course the
ones in the set are quite a bit smaller
than the full size but if you even it
out as far as value you're getting about
the same value as far as product when
you get the full-size now but you're now
you're going to get to try lots of them
instead of just getting one big full
size so you have to decide whether
that's a good product for you or not to
face also released another highly
anticipated product the sugar pop
palette which I broke down and ordered
because it looks so amazing I bought way
too much makeup lately I need to stop I
know you know exactly what I'm talking
about but the colors are just absolutely
gorgeous they're all shimmers and
glitters and then also of course the
full-size dark chocolate Soleil bronzer
for thirty dollars and that is a matte
bronzer also jeffree star came out with
some new lipsticks in his line they are
the liquid to matte velour liquid
lipsticks one is called Queen supreme
and it's a pinky purple weirdo which is
a black 714 which is a nude pink and
unicorn blood which is a dark red oh and
also celebrity skin which is a nude and
that's the add on to the three existing
shades just one thing in natural news
earth kiss came out with a brand new
mass collection there are six different
masks they are 299 each they have white
tie clay for rejuvenation clean up mud
for exfoliating detox mud for pore
cleansing Moroccan clay for pore
refining miracle clay facial for
hydrating and finally million-dollar
clay for facial revitalizing they also
have free shipping on orders over twenty
dollars lots and lots and lots of
Sephora news this week holy schmoly here
it comes okay first of all I don't
normally report on perfume releases but
there's two I want to mention first is
one called the blends and that's the
name of the brand I'm assuming it is
called the custom fragrance blending kit
it is one hundred fifty dollars but let
me tell you what it is because it's
interesting you get 10 roller balls and
sent such as water lily grassy vert over
further there Bert over mmm amber
vanilla force patchouli and tropic bloom
okay and then what you do is you can mix
the roller balls onto your skin to
create your own unique fragrance it also
comes with recipes for ones that they
have created and suggestions on how to
use the roller balls also Sephora
favorites has come out with a new
perfume sampler there it's called the
bottle dreams perfume sampler it's $58
it comes with seven deluxe sample size
perfumes including bvlgari omnia
crystalline I'm not familiar with that
one you probably are though Elizabeth
and James Nirvana black and also the
Nirvana white the Escada joyful freshest
fresh life gucci guilty and Lancome love
es Belle so what you do is you try the
seven deluxe samples you pick which one
is your favorite you take your little
certificate into sephora and then
you get a full-size of whichever perfume
you chose from the sampler now it's only
the one ounce version but it is still
considered a full-size so that's pretty
nice I was like those sample kits I
thought I mentioned that too also sa
lauder has come out with a very
interesting product it's called the
crescent white BB cream it's a
lightweight BB cream that creates an
even tone finish that minimizes a look
of dark spots and imperfection for the
skin it features brightening properties
to create a luminous complexion and a
high level of SPF SPF 50 also cover
effects has come out with a really
interesting product called custom cover
drops there's 24 shades and it's a
formula featuring pure pigments that
allow you to customize any product in
your beauty regimen to control the level
of coverage so if you have a even just a
lotion and you want to make an attentive
moisturizer boom now you've got a tinted
moisturizer Boop now you've got a light
coverage foundation boo boo now you've
got a full coverage foundation it's just
and you know yet depending on how many
drops you use that's how full coverage
the foundation that you make is so you
can add it to an existing foundation you
have you can add it to an existing
tinted moisturizer it says it works with
water silicone and oil-based products I
thought that was really cool and
innovative and I definitely want to
share that with you Bobby Brown also has
a brand new skin smoothing poor
Perfector for thirty-eight dollars
Lancome has one as well called the
la-based pro-poor eraser perfecting
makeup primer along with the primary
Lancome has also released a brand new
line of lipsticks called the shine lover
vibrant shine lip sticks they're
twenty-five dollars apiece they are
moisturizing they're glossy and they're
infused with hyaluronic acid and Rose
the musket oil there's 14 shades
including for Sephora exclusive shades
Emily inside Sephora says that they are
very shiny there are light weights then
put the colors are pigmented and they're
very moisturizing she said the only
downfall is that there is a very odd
very strong fruity scent so if you are
scared or you do not like those fruity
scents than or strong smelling lip
products then you should definitely pass
on these according to Emily Laura
Mercier has come out with a few new
products including a face illuminator
outer there's one shade called
indiscretion and extra lash sculpting
mascara a new brow definer which is a
wax gel formula and then a new eyebrow
gel Becca's released a low-light
highlight perfecting pressed palette and
it is the low-light sculpting Perfector
pressed and then the shimmering skin
Perfector pressed in opal put together
in a duo so you can get them together
clinique has released six new shades in
their color pop collection Heather pop
pinkpop Rosie pop pansy pop melon pop
and fig pop and they are very vibrant
yet natural looking blushes and they are
just gorgeously pressed into that floral
shape they're absolutely beautiful in
the past two weeks we have reported
about Smashbox and the new Donald
Robertson collection doll Robinson is an
Instagram artist now they have a
collection that you can get all together
comes with four matte lipsticks and for
gel eyeliners for one hundred and fifty
dollars so if you're excited about those
if you swatch those and you love them
and you can get them all together in
that one set now I was debating whether
I wanted a report on this but I feel
like I kind of have to I put it off last
week because I had a really bad
experience with the ciate lash lights
mascara over the summer last summer so I
was like ciate makeup like their nail
polish is even just kind of for a
high-end nail polish so I wasn't gonna
report on it but it's just all over
Sephora so I figured I would let you
know ciate does have a lot of makeup
products there when Sephora including
the triple shot mascara the glow pop
cream highlighter something called a lip
chalk which is a matte lip crayon the
patent pout lip lacquer and I chalk
which is a pastel I pencil and a glow
pop cream bronzer nude sticks is also
released a few products and that's
another brand where I try their mascara
and did not like it so I was like nude
sticks boom so if you've ever tried good
nude sticks products let me know in the
comments below but they now have a mat
and blemish pencil a blur pencil which
acts like an instant line crease and
poor blurring tool for a flawless
complexion also a clean up pencil which
is one of those makeup eraser pencils
it instantly removes makeup mistakes in
just one like draw and white some really
exciting news from Emily insight Sephora
she says that they are getting rid of
some of their makeup brands in order to
make room for new brands are also
getting rid of a couple of skincare
brands and I am going to fill you in on
those right now and you are not going to
believe it but stila is leaving so fora
stores like I'm just like feeling the
tears like welling up like are you
kidding me like i love sila but seal is
leaving sephora stores they're going to
continue selling the liquid black
eyeliner but that's pretty much it it's
currently still available online but it
will be leaving their brick-and-mortar
stores giorgio armani however is now
arriving in sephora stores and you will
be able to buy those in stores if not
already very very soon the two skincare
brands that are leaving sephora our
bliss and soap and glory and that's
another one it's like it breaks my heart
because I love both of those brands very
very much they're adding a Korean
skincare line called belief or belief b
li f which is a new brand she said the
packaging is very very simple but the
products are absolutely amazing she
recommends that you check them out she
said all of the products are sulfate
paraben and phthalate-free as well as
petrolatum free since that they don't
have any synthetic preservatives no Dino
fragrances and no animal origin and
greedy ins there are extremely clean
brands and they will now be featured at
Sephora also a product that she has let
me know about but I cannot find any
pictures anywhere in the Make Up For
Ever pixi glosses there are supposedly
going to be 24 shades that there and
they're super pigmented with high shine
they have a patent-pending brush with a
divot and one side that's supposed to
hold more color for a smoother
application there's going to be nudes
pinks reds and some crazy colors such as
ever green and purple and QVC news the
most exciting thing coming out is on the
27th of March it cosmetics is going to
have a today's special value or tsv it's
going to be a kit called the your way to
radiant skin color
section they're keeping everything
pretty hush-hush but our QVC reporter
Susan was able to acquire some pictures
so this is what we're getting right here
it's a five piece collection including a
CC plus cream illumination of vitality
face disc which is the matte bronzer the
yellow light luminizing powder and a
blush stain and she absolutely loves
that palette also there would be one
shadow trio and pretty in spring a
heavenly Lux radiance wand brush which
is a brand new brush and also a note ugh
dual I shadow brush she also saw listed
and I hope I pronounces correctly
cogiendo moisture foundation with brush
and color base for fifty nine dollars
plus the three dollars shipping and
handling susan has also bracele accepted
the challenge of reporting on HSN as
well she saw some really exciting things
on there especially from Becca because
their prices are cut down on HSN even
including the shipping so they have the
ombre nudes palette for $34 the
shimmering skin Perfector trio that I
got over Christmas that I love for 1995
also the Becca the one perfecting brush
for forty dollars i'm pretty sure the
original price on that is fifty dollars
they're also carrying the Becca ultimate
coverage complexion cream and the
coverage concealing cream on HSN so
check it out if you're interested she
also wants to let you know that HSN also
carries lines such as Smashbox to face
lorac benefit Korres Trish McEvoy and
you air now a lot of those brands have
been on HSN for a while but they've
really been beefing up their makeup
