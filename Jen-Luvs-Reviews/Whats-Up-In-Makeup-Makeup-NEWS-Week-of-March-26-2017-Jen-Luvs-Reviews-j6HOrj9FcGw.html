Jen from gin mugs reviews and what's up
and makeup starts now welcome to West
and makeup for March twenty six twenty
seventeen let's get started with some
top industry news there's so much fame
in this photo one person has worked with
Prada DKNY and gia did and the other had
her own nail polish collection for OPI
just like Miss Piggy have you guessed it
yet it's Selena Gomez and Pat McGrath
that you are collabing in what appears
to be a pretty in pink and glitter
concept according to McGrath Instagram
post where it shows a small clip of the
two together while Gomez is blowing pink
glitter all over and McGrath is living
it up and all smiles in the background
what will the product be we'll just have
to wait and see hmm is launching a
limited edition cosmetics collection for
spring and here are some of the
highlights first the liquid foundation
for 1799 highlighter concealer pen 999
strobing palette also 1799 makeup bag
999 shoving brush 699 a highlighting
concealer brush 799 and regular makeup
brush 999 a sheet mask on steroids
that's what people are saying about the
newest no needle facial wrinkle erasing
treatment from Korea the treatment is
exclusively available at luis's in
California the skin care facility of
Georgia Lewis who is the facialist to
a-listers like Jennifer Aniston the
skull paula treatment essentially drives
an ingredient called poly l-lactic acid
along with a mixture of anti-aging
ingredients such as niacinamide and
caffeine into the top layer of the skin
the actual treatment involves two steps
step one is a serum which is applied to
the face and step two is a dry sheet map
that's carefully molded to the contours
of your face the sheet mask is made with
encapsulated hydrogen and when the
hydrogen meets the serum it drives the
filler inquiry
hands into the skin after 10 minutes the
mass drive into a film and when the film
is removed it leaves the skin smooth and
unclogs pores according to the makers of
skull Paulo one treatment can last
around six weeks and a series of three
treatments done in one week intervals
can last up to five months there is no
downtime but you'll have to avoid water
including sweat for 12 hours after the
treatment starts at one hundred eighty
dollars with a team member at luis's but
reserve some big bucks if you wish to
have Georgia Lewis herself do the
treatment right now her waiting list is
closed but when it opens up her services
are available for six hundred dollars

everyone wants a good deal and some of
us look to social media trading selling
and buying groups to find them a segment
of makeup lovers have no qualms about
getting gently users watched Ione's if
it means saving big on a higher-end
product and will see other make of
enthusiasts as trustworthy that's where
many of these groups go wrong as did one
Facebook makeup sell and swap group
based in Canada 80 people so far are
claiming fraud after joining group and
buying items that were only partially
received or never received at all the
group allegedly run by a woman from
kitchener ontario had a well-established
number based around 200 members one
member who was a victim of the scam
stated when i joined this group the
owner made me feel like she was my
friend that i could talk to her i could
messenger if I had anything I needed to
say you know she was there for me she
made me trust her this victim claims to
have lost over two thousand dollars as a
result of 29 train
consisting of four hundred items the
victims have started their own Facebook
group where they have totaled what has
been a whopping loss of 37,500 six
dollars among 109 people with only 11
people ever having received any form of
refund for items not received some of
the victims will have to pursue civil
actions in order to recoup their money
