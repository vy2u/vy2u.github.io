reviews and you are watching what's up
and make up most exciting thing that I
saw this week was the release of the
tart summer collection we're now into a
few days in the spring and the summer
collections are starting to roll out
their collection is called the poppy
picnic collection it is a
limited-edition collection including the
puppy picnic limited edition Amazonian
clay I and cheek palette no it is a
matte eye and cheek palette infused with
the Amazonian clay and celebrates the
fun florals of summer they are all
limited edition shade also in that
collection is the limited edition lights
camera lashes precision long-wear
eyeliner it looks like it's purple but
it's actually in a deep brown shade if
you want a real glam eyelash curler
there's also the neon lights limited
edition picture-perfect eyelash curler
then they now have an Amazonian butter
lipstick in Park Avenue princess to go
but they're very famous bronzer and a
rerelease of their rain forest after
dark colored clay eye and cheek palette
that was very very popular i believe
last spring and summer and then finally
a new lipsurgence lip cream there are
four shades according to the blog of
musings of amused there her name is
Isabella they also have a tart guard
sunscreen lotion that's SPF 30 and then
also another palette called the tarc
showstopper clay palette and it's $38
and theirs are coming soon if you go to
the link down below I will link you to
Isabella's blog post and you can check
out those items they're the bomb also
came out with a new palette called the
balm of voyage to and it is a face
palette for about forty dollars they
call it a multitasking travel companion
featuring nine exclusive triple milled
eyeshadows which may use wet or dry two
blushes a bronzer a highlighter and to a
versatile lip and cheek creams that are
stowed away in a little compartment also
in YouTube news Melissa Autry has
released a new makeup line there are
three lipsticks and they are called pink
power supreme and Wiggy they are
seventeen dollars each I will also link
that down below in case you are
interested in those in Sephora news
estee lauder has released their bronze
goddess products for this year including
the bronze goddess shimmering nudes face
and eye palette for $55 it is a sheer
sun saturated palette of 3i shades of
bronzer and dramatic nudes for face
cheeks and eyes also in that collection
they have the bronze goddess
illuminating powder Julie I looked up
five different ways to say that word I'm
not sure if I got the right one but
that's my best try jilly smashbox also
released for more shades in there la
lights blendable lip and cheek colors
there only had released one previously
so I'm happy to see that they're
releasing more emily insights of 4 says
she doesn't understand why they didn't
launch him all the same time but what
else she says they're not too many
people reaching for them in the store so
she can't really tell you a lot of
customer opinions of them but she does
seem to be liking the newer shades
especially the bronze and highlighter
one she said they are so shimmery and
beautiful algenis has released a
repairing tint and radiance moisturizer
and SPF in four shades clinic has
released more of their cheek pop blushes
there are eight new shades currently
available only to the IB rouges on these
Sephora website you might be able to
find them other places they've also
released some new lip colors to go along
with those they're called the Clinique
pop lip color + primer and they are in
16 shades they are a rich weightless
formula that fuses bold saturated color
with a smoothing primer so I'm very
curious to see what those are all about
giorgio armani has released a very
interesting-looking bronzer look at that
it's so pretty it is called the Sun
fabric sheer bronzer there are four
shades it promises a sheer velvety soft
formula that leaves a natural looking
finish Sephora collection has released

glosses in there
shake and night out as well as a Rouge
infusion lip stain and red essence and a
colorful blush in raspberry sheen the

believe it is gold and also a jumbo 12
hour waterproof liner and peacock blue
shimmer and two colorful blushes in
orange pop and fuchsia flash along with
those you also get a set of ombre bobby
pin ups in green all those bright colors
all over the place I don't know if my
eyes can handle it finally they have
released the serpentine skinny brush rap
for $39 it comes with a powder brush a
foundation brush a crease brush a shadow
brush a liner brush and then in a nice
cream scalloped pouch Emily inside
Sephora has so updates for us for some
things that we've reported on in
previous weeks including the Smashbox
plus Donald Robinson be legendary matte
lipstick she says that it is ultra matte
it's super cute package II the colors
are very vibrant and gorgeous she says
even though it stays hydrating it still
is a little bit dry however it really is
super long wearing also an update on one
that a lot of people ask me about the
benefit Porefessional license to blog
she says she hasn't personally tried it
but the clients who have have been
absolutely loving up but she said one
important tip with it is not to apply it
straight to your face but you use your
fingers instead because if you apply it
straight to your face it actually will
lift your makeup off of your face she
says unlike oil sheets which help remove
the excess oil on your face it seems to
just kind of cover it up however for
some it does work and mattifies the face
but the lasting power is really only a
couple of hours there is a controversy
and high-end news i'm not sure if you
saw this but the owners of Dolce &amp;amp;
Gabbana are in big trouble with
celebrities all over Hollywood including
Elton John and Ellen DeGeneres who are
now starting a boycotting campaign all
over social media and the regular media
why are they boycotting it's because the
owners
would an Italian magazine that babies
born from an vitro fertilization are
synthetic and come from rented wounds
that does not make people like Elton
John happy who has children from in
vitro fertilization and this couldn't
come into the worst time for Dolce &amp;amp;
Gabbana as far as makeup lovers you're
going to have to choose between
boycotting or buying their new spring
collection including the smooth eye
color quad and color explosion and
intense of butter gloss in bougainville
I believe that's how it's pronounced
it's an island in Papua New Guinea and
also some nail lacquers and Blue Angel
boog on via grass and soul I hate to say
like that but I can't say it seriously
because I don't know if I'm saying it
right or not so the best thing I can do
to protect my ego is to just say it
dramatically on to Edward best they have
a matte artists eye shadow palette for
$75 Charlotte Tilbury starting to show
up places like Nordstrom there now
clinic carrying the goddess clay mask
which is very exciting for Charlotte
Tilbury fans it is seventy dollars if
you choose to go pick that up also
Clarence has a new generation ever
lasting foundation and SPF 15 it claims
to be lightweight and a full coverage
formula for forty dollars available in
fourteen shades and also an instant
light lip comfort oil that's a limited
edition in honey and it supposedly
transforms your lips from Brian damage
to plump and luscious while adding just
a hint of color and that's $23 and
skincare high and clarisonic now has a
smart profile set and this is what it
says on the nordstrom website it says
the clarisonic smart technology enables
the smart profile device to read the two
new smart enabled brush heads to
automatically adjust between gentle and
deep cleansing for an optimal
head-to-toe experience how about that
also the brush head replacement
indicator illuminates to prompt you when
it's time to replace the brush head it
comes with a facial brush head a turbo
massage body brush head a refining skin
polish or refreshing gel and the price
is $265 which is not shocking for people
that already own clarisonic and know it
pran's it is quite expensive but I've
heard it is well worth it Bobby Brown
now has an intensive skin serum
foundation and SPF 40 according to the
nordstrom website it's ideal for normal
to dry skin types let's go to drugstore
news cuz we gotta go to drugstore news
cuz that high-end stuff is making me
sweat Sonia Kashuk has come out with her

guys here naomi said she saw the l'oreal
Allah palette nude one at walmart for
1584 which is what i paid for it but
