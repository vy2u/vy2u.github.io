leaving the mystery make up I'm Jen from
Jen loves reviews and what's a bit make
up starts now
welcome to what's up and make up for
march 5th 2017 let's get right into that
top industry news winged liner fans rave
about the Kat Von D tattoo liner saying
it is one of the best on the market but
can it be better the answer is yes it
can
Kat Von D went to social media to
announce she's working on a new super
matte finish version no word on the
exact price or a launch date or where
it'll be available stay tuned for
details and if you're a fan of pretty
packaging then hold on to your hat
Christian LaBute saan is launching eye

lot of buzz the collection includes a
velvet eye definer pencil brow defining
pencil lash amplifying lacquer mascara
and the luminous ink liner of which one
shade is the iconic red the collection
will be launching March 23rd on the Lou
blue tone site $40 to $75 per item
Korean pop ups in stores inside

hard to acquire items for a few more
weeks among the highlights white flower

factory for $15 Cho Sangha bounced up
packed powder foundation in three shades
each $36 an Abbe Mart ten piece brush
set for $60 serums have become a staple
of most people's skincare routine with
their ever-growing popularity you might
find you're buying a serum for this and
a serum for that but is there one serum
that's right for your needs
Geils says yes apothecary preparations
from Kiehl's is a custom serum you mix
fresh at home getting your personalized
formula kit created is pretty simple you
visit a Keele store where they will do
simple testing for skin hydration and
health then combine it with their skin
Atlas to find exactly
what your skin needs with this
information they'll determine the exact
nature of ingredients your skin is
craving from there you'll receive a
custom label bottle containing skin
strengthening concentrate and your two
personalized complexes you then take
your personalized formula kit home and
mix it fresh does this idea appeal to
you let us know in the comments below
and to find a store close to you visit
the Kiehl's website many of you have
noticed that finding NYC cosmetics and
stores is getting harder trips to the
NYC website with the hopes of finding
favorite products have resulted in
frustration for many this led to rumors
that the brand was closing its doors but
news was scarce the good news is the
brand's not closing its doors completely
the bad news is the brand is going to
get harder to find as it's no longer
being carried in the u.s. New York color
is only going to be available to those
in Canada when searching for your
favorite products on various websites
you may be surprised by what they could
now cost you let's take a look at the
popular NYC smooth skin loose face
powder for example usually retailing for
$2.99 it is now going for a minimum of
three dollars and 59 cents plus three
dollars and three cents in shipping on
eBay that's a total of six dollars and
62 cents or if purchasing from Sears
calm was shipping it could run as high
as 16 dollars and 77 cents
our suggestion is if you are lucky
enough to still find NYC cosmetics in
your local store stock up while you can
all of us get a bit excited when
expecting a package from Ulta or Sephora
to arrive at our door some of us gamble
on surprise boxes that give us the joy
of expectation and the thrill of

tube of Vaseline as the latest gift not
knowing exactly what was going on she
would just dispose of the items but then
the neighbors got to talking comparing
notes now over 5,500
