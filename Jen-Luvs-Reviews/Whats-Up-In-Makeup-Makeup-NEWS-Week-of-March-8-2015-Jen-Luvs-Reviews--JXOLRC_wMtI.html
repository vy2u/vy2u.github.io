loves reviews and you are watching
what's up in makeup buckle up ladies is
going to be a long one first up if you
have been looking everywhere for that
new L'Oreal Allah palette it is now
available on L'Oreal's website I haven't
seen anyone find it in us stores yet it
has been available in the UK for quite
some time but it hasn't shown up in the
US but now we can buy it at least on
L'Oreal's website which is awesome it is
1999 and I am very curious to see what's
going to happen once it actually is
released in stores speaking of drugs to
our newsroom will have some products on
sale this week at walgreens if you've
been craving those lasting finish
lipsticks or their BB creams they are
now fifty percent off for the rest of
March Maybelline is teasing us with a
palette on walmart's website called the
blushed nudes and it is ten dollars and
it looks very similar to their the
brights the smokes and the regular nudes
palettes it has been sold out on
walmart's website forever I don't think
anybody actually got it I think that it
just hasn't officially been released yet
but it is there if you want to see what
it looks like you just can't get it
that's not nice Maybelline a couple of
wet and wild releases this week they now
have a color icon brow kit it's a dollar
ninety-nine and it comes in four shades
and they're very creative names so I
have to read them first one is brunette
do it better black ops blonde moment and
then ginger roots and it comes with a
brow pencil and three browse stencils
also wet and wild has a new limited
edition eyeshadow collection called the
Silver Lake collection there are five
different palettes available call it
embrace obscurity vegan culture of vinyl
collection thrift store chic and
California roll and we know in the past
a lot of those white plastic pallets
have not been as good as the regular
line hopefully these can surpass
expectations based on the packaging and
what we know of what and while palettes
that are in those kinds of baggage
encoder and it's called the lovely look
set it is fifteen dollar
and it comes with a foundation brush a
shade brush a flat eyeliner brush at an
angle blush brush and a powder brush
also lip smackers if you want to bring
back your childhood or if you're still
happen to be in childhood they have
three new trios there's a chocolate
theme a donut theme and an ice cream
sundae theme young lots of Sephora news
this week what seems to be the biggest
news are the new makeup forever step one
equalizers it looks like a beautiful
rainbow in the store they are gorgeous
they are have different textures there's
a mattifying primer which reduces shine
a smoothing primer which evens the skin
texture a hydrating primer which
restores the skins balance a nourishing
primer that moisturizes and comforts a
redness correcting primer that
neutralizes redness and then they have
ones for tone including the radiant
primer in blue which adds radiance and
light to the skin there's a pink one and
a yellow one that add radiance to
lightning and skin tones depending on
what your undertone is and then there is
a peach one that adds radiance to medium
tan skin and then one in caramel which
adds radiance to dark skin tones we have
a new insight sephora reporter named
rochelle from the channel glam moms and
she wanted to let us know that they
remind her of the Mac prep and prime
primers and the ones for texture seem to
be getting the best response in her
store the tone primer she's feels like
they work the best when the skin is
hydrated and it's applied with the
sponge or with fingers rather than a
brush emily inside sephora also says
that they've been getting positive
reviews at her store she said they have
a nice consistency and it's long lasting
one thing that people have been a little
upset about is it's the not not the same
consistency that they are used to the
new smoothing one is still nice but it's
thicker than the old formula and it also
doesn't leave that glow that the old one
used to so people that were in love with
the old formula are a little
disappointed and the new revamped
formula their minerals have a new lip
oil balm there are sixteen dollars and
they come in eighteen shades Sephora
describes this as an oil rich formula
that delivers vibrant color with a slick
shine and a comfortable color stain
tells us that they are definitely for
people that want a wash of color but
they are really hydrating and they stay
in your lips super fast Rochelle says if
you like the tinted bombs from fresh you
will probably love these and they are a
bit cheaper than the ones from fresh
algenis also came out with a repairing
tint and radiance moisturizer with SPF
30 for $42 it does come in four shades
there's not a whole lot of information
on the Sephora site yet because it's not
listed according to Rachelle but she
says it does blurred lines and
imperfections and evens out the skin
tone for a natural coverage she is
absolutely in love with the stuff and
highly recommends it if you are
interested in Rachelle's review I will
link that down below SI Lauder came out
with a brand new and beautiful palette
called the bronze goddess shimmering
nudes eyeshadow palette in that palette
you have five bold nudes and three
metallic eye shades also they came out
with the bronze goddess shimmering nudes
face and eye palette as well to
complement that get your glow on getting
ready for the summer time the Sephora
collection came out with a brow enhancer
it comes in six shades and it is a jumbo
highlighter pencil for defining
enhancing the brow bone and what I was
impressed by was the range of shades
from very light to very deep for all my
oily skin friends out there benefit
professional released the license to
blot it is an instant oil blotting stick
with tiny invisible blotting spheres
that mattifying shine for up to six
hours of application it's very
interesting looking it's a real of
benefits packaging here is to see
reviews on that one as well you're
looking about with a set based on their
very popular eyeshadow shade kitten it's

makeup set is twenty dollars you get 3
deluxe ice samples one of the kitten eye
shadow one of the kitten lip glaze and
one of the kitten convertible color

Sephora news Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana has a new

goodness Giorgio
he came out with some new lip pencils

skin Perfector poured and it's $38 and
there are five shades and it looks like
it's the same as their liquid shimmering
skin Perfector zits just in a more solid
creamy kind of form perricone md came
out with two more know something
something's there's no highlighter
highlighter and a no lip gloss lip gloss
the highlighter is just seems like a
regular highlighter to me I don't know
maybe I'm ignorant to it and the lip
gloss is an anti-aging lip treatment as
well so that's kind of what makes it I
guess no lip gloss lip gloss I don't
know but supposedly it's deeply
nourishing and it does protect from sun
damage as well so it sounds like a great
product white beauty released their new
march lip shade they had 14 februari and
now they have one for march they are

couple more updates from Emily inside
Sephora of some of the products that we
featured in previous episodes of what's
up in makeup the Urban Decay mascara
resurrection to her seems like a huge
bust like bad and I probably could have
called that one from the jump basically
what you're supposed to do is you're
supposed to use the mascara to kind of
resurrect your mascara through the day
to give it more life she said it's just
bad it's a great concept but it's bad
she said it looks like Elmer's glue in a
tube the smell is unpleasant she says
some people claim that it actually makes
your lashes stick together because of
its gooey consistency no no on the other
hand the bare essentials pop of passion
products are getting rave reviews from
Emily and the people in her store she
said that the blush bombs are amazing
she's watched them and she could not
believe the consistency that they had
such a nice glow and the color left was
so nice and subtle they're easy to blend
and easy to build she also said the lip
balms are very very nice they've come in
eight shades and they're extremely
moisturizing and it has great
pigmentation for a bomb they'll share
but it's a really nice wash of color in
alter news stila came out with two
different try it sets the bright

on in Mac this week the bail bail when
collection came out this week and I'm
just going to quote Tim Thalia it's an
amazing blog I'm going to quote her as
far as the quality of these products she
says the lipsticks are the best
performers though they are due pible the
eye palette is nice if you use a damp
but can be messy to use dry the duty
powder looks beautiful on but the
texture could be denser so that's what
Tim Talia has to say and I trust her
wholeheartedly in her reviews coming out
on March twelfth the Mac plus julia
petite collection is launching on line
and will be available in select mac
locations on march 19th if you don't
know who julia petite is she is a
brazilian makeup artist and lifestyle
blogger and the collection is supposed

landscape of sao paulo and sunkist
hughes primed to release your inner
brazilian bombshell so if you have an
inner Brazilian bombshell that is just
dying to get out then this may be the
collection for you it comes out really
