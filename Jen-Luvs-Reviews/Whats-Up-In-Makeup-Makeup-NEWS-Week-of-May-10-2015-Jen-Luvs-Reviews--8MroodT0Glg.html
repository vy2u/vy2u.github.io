reviews and you are watching what's up
in makeup in top news in my opinion this
week i am very excited about the new
Coastal Scents lipsticks they are four
dollars each and there are fifteen
shades available from vibrant pinks to
deep reds to rich purples they are
paraben free which is very very nice
special rapporteur Leanne bought all 14
colors she says they're pretty good
pigmentation especially going for the
darker colors but the picture the colors
are a little bit different than the way
they actually are in person so just be
aware of that if you are going to order
those but she feels like when you're
paying four dollars for a lipstick it's
totally worth it also OCC has announced
their spring and summer collection of
2015 it is called the cosplay collection
and there are five new lip tars well new
ish lip tars that have coordinating and
nail polish colors they're called
cha-cha pale which is a tangerine damn
true which is a baby pink belladonna
which is an ultraviolet cosplay which is
a teal toned green and then John Doe
pale which is an ash toned taupe it
looks like all of those lip colors are
Matt I there is a lip tar that does not
have a matching nail polish that one is
called momento and it is a pink plumbing
neutral and then there's a nail polish
that is not in a lip color and that is
called silence grade which is a beige
shimmer the availability on those is
June first at OCC makeup.com they will
also be available at beautylish.com
beauty.com and Nordstrom some of the
comments on different blog posts are
talking about that these are a lot of
rape promotes from OCC but OCC is
claiming that they're redoing their
formula so even though it seems like
they might be reproducing that they are
new because the formula is new in
Sephora news sad Sephora news at this
point bite beauty came out with their
monthly lip color that is now sold out
but I figured I'd
you know what it was it was it's the lip
lab limited release they come out with
one every month and it was shade 005 in
lavender thistle and it's really really
pretty i'm sad that it's already gone it
was described as a hazy lilac sephora
collection has a new contour product
that is not quite out yet but you can
sign up if you go to the product you can
click where it says email me and i'll
let you know when it's available if you
are interested in it it is the highlight
low-light face contour duo there are
four shades from light to deep dior has
quite a few new products well they're
not new they've been available on doors
website into your counters but now
they're available at Sephora the first
one is the diorskin nude tan healthy
glow enhancing powder tie-dye edition
those things are stinking gorgeous also
they have the designer five color
palettes for $62 there five shade
eyeshadow palettes with a shadow base
two eyeshadows a highlighter and an
eyeliner it's currently also listed as
sold out but it is brand-new at Sephora
so that should be coming very very soon
there are five different palettes and
navy khaki nude pink amber and taupe I
believe those were already available and
there now just on so forth starting to
be on so forest website but they are new
for this season dior also has the
illuminating neutrals I palette for $62
it comes with a base primer a black
powder eyeliner and for eyeshadows Bobby
Brown also has a new product called the
shimmering sands I palette we did
mention that and what's up a makeup last
week for the body brown website but now
it is available on Sephora at seventy
dollars it's 12 nude shadows in a range
of all different textures laura has been
accepting lots of new brands into their
stores recently the one that i noticed
this week is called herb orion and it is
a korean brand and they have a BB cream
and a CC cream from that brand the BB
cream says its enriched with ginseng for
a flawless looking coverage and
protection helping to refine skins
texture sorts visibly smoother and
softer it's $39 it's listed as coming
soon but there are going to be two
shades
in like a light color and a light medium
color the CC cream is currently
available it's $44 they described it as
a high-definition skin perfecting cream
with one shade fits all color matching
technology for a luminous soft and
flawless looking complexion there are
some other products from this line
available including three different face
masks and exfoliator and a cleansing oil
also from stila there is a new aqua
globe perfecting primer stick its twenty
eight dollars they describe it as a
cooling water based primer stick that
prep skin from makeup application that
is also available at Ulta we're going to
get into more Alta stuff later but the
Stila stuff is kind of doubling up at
Ulta and sephora so the next thing I
wanted to talk to you about is besame
cosmetics which is a relatively new
brand for sephora i absolutely love
their vanilla face powder they now have
these classic color lipsticks they're
$22 each there are six shades available
they describe the lipstick as a satin
matte finish that delivers full coverage
in one coat and look at that gorgeous
packaging holy beje-- oly tons of
bronzing and contouring products this
week including the besame cosmetics but
doire short hair contour brush looks a
little more like a hairbrush than a face
brush but we'll see about that it's very
interesting-looking no doubt about that
into more contouring bronzing products
Bobbi Brown has a face and body bronzing
duo for forty-eight dollars that comes
in two shades peter thomas roth has a
radiant instant mineral brush on bronzer
sunscreen with SPF 30 sila has the stay
all day bronzer for face and body it's
in three shades and again that is
available ulta as well rowland has the
terracotta sunglow kit it's $53 they
call it the world first bronzer launched
in 1984 a say it creates a
natural-looking bronzed look so
apparently this is not a brand new
product but it seems to be new to
sephora YSL also has the healthy glow
balma powder
for $55 and estee lauder has the bronze
goddess shimmering nudes face and eye
palette for $55 there's three eyeshadow
shades and one bronzer shade there and
sephora and nail polish news butter
london has now released the high tea
lacquer collection there are six shades
or fifteen dollars each I'm going to
kind of look at the shades and kind of
guesstimate what kinds of colors we're
looking at we're looking at a forest
green a bright coral a deep burgundy a
blue toned silver a light brown and a
bright buttercup yellow and those are my
interpretations not butter london's
formula x has a very interesting product
called the infinite ombre nail design
set it's thirty dollars they call it a
revolutionary five polish nail design
set it helps give you that ombre look
without all of the sponging and
craziness you have to do to get a true
ombre it comes with 4.1 3-ounce effects
nail colors there's different shades in
boundless berry which is an electric
pink infinite indigo which is a vivid
bluish purple timeless teal which is a
dynamic blue green and limitless lemon
which is a radiant yellow now the most
important part of this it seems is the
point for ounce effects nail color and
platinum prime which is your silver
anchor base that kind of brings it all
together in alta news lorac has released
the alter ego lipsett you have three
different choices of what you want to do
with this lip set it's thirty dollars
online only there's a nude option a pink
option and a plum option it includes to
alter ego lipsticks plus two matching

the lipstick and the gloss together or

perfecting primer for $28 also the Stila
stay all day contouring bronzer for face
and body like I mentioned in the sephora

aqua globe watercolor blush has been
available sephora for a while but is now
available altos $26 there's five shade

friend my good friend Susan over her
channel is called Susan w she actually
purchased this on pre-orders so she has
a video up of all the products and her
opinions so if you're interested in that
you can go ahead and click the link down
in the description and you can check out
that tsv or today's special value for
yourself Bare Minerals has a new palette
out at QVC called the ready eyeshadows
eight point 0 Royals collection it's 36
36 Plus that three dollars shipping and
shipping and handling and all of these
shadows are queen and then a name so
we've got queen Phyllis Queen Dana Dana
yeah Dana Queen Linda Queen Marie matte
cream filled cream Phyllis now I can't
even read them all but there's there's a
like Buttercup shade an angel pink a
medium gold am at smoky lavender you can
see all of those beautiful shades there
it does include a little brush with the
palette 2 which is very nice Susan want
to let you know that the Queen
are not new they came out a few years
ago but they were in those loose
pigments and they were absolutely
gorgeous when they were in the loose
pigments she's repurchased them several
times and they're great for brown eyes
she says specifically and she has to say
they are probably her all-time favorite
colors which is a lot for Susan to say
that woman owns a lot of awesome
incredible makeup bareminerals also has
another new palette out called the
archer defined brow perfecting palette
it comes with a brush it's 3274 plus the
three dollars shipping and handling the
brow perfecting palette comes with a
brow highlighter a light brown powder
and a dark brow powder so you can
customize it for your own shade that you
need for your brows it also comes with a
double ended arch and define brush two
more quick things from QVC that are
quite interesting that we wanted to
mention QVC is now carrying the cover FX
drops they have less choices compared to
sephora they are thirty-eight dollars on
the website though plus the three
dollars shipping and handling so 39
point so the 41 dollars compared to
forty four dollars on the sephora
website also the other thing they're
caring is the josie maran argan
enlightenment aluminized veil it's the
same prices at sephora but you also get
a brush with it and you have to pay that
you do have to pay that three dollars
shipping so depending on what your
shipping is with Sephora you'll have to
kind of way which one is a better deal
