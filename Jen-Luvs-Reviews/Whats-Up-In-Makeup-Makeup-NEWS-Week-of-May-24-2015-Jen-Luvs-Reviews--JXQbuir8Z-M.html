you
hello my friends this is jen from Genlis
reviews and you are watching what's up
in makeup in top news this week urban
decay has shown us a new vault and it is
called the stock pile lip vault right
now it is only available in UK but my
American friends you can have it shipped
to you from Selfridges i will put the
link to the website down below it is 180
pounds i will put me american dollars
here also you're going to have to pay
shipping if you really want it hopefully
we will see it in the US at some point
but no news as to when it comes with 10
revolution lipsticks and 10 24 7 glide
on lip pencils lots going on in sephora
favorites news this week some of these
we missed in previous weeks but all of
them have come out this month i just
wanted to mention them to you support
favorite kits are fantastic for trying
high end products that maybe you don't
want to buy a full-size but you want to
have a good shot at trying out the
product this one is a really great one
it's called the Sun safety kit it's $32
they say that it's a hand-picked 16
piece set featuring SPF and self-tanning
products to keep you protected from head
to toe plus a hot pink beach friendly
reusable travel bag and twenty dollars
of each kit sold will benefit the skin
cancer foundation in that kit you get
products from amore pacific clearance
clinic dr. dennis gross dr jart fresh
josie maran Korres Murad Ali Hendrickson
origins peter thomas roth shiseido st.
Tropez supergoop and vita liberata so
and then you get the travel bag as well
there's also a kit called the beauty on
the fly ultimate travel bag for face
body and hair it's a 12 piece collection
featuring skin and hair essentials plus
a travel bag everything you need in your
beauty routine for a weekend trip that's
how they are marketing it in that kit
you get products from algenis first a
beauty kate somerville only hendrickson
fresh origins glam glow vitae Liberata
josie maran and living proof and then
one product from alterna for summer they
have also come out with the spray of
sunshine perfume sampler the
really really cool for those perfume
fanatics where you're not really sure
what perfume you will really love you
get six up those little spray bottles
the little sample size spray bottles of
perfume and then you get a voucher to
get a rollerball so it's twenty-four
dollars for the sampler kit and then a
rollerball is typically anywhere between
twenty and twenty-five dollars so really
you're getting the little samples for
free and then you trade in the coupon
for a roller bowl of your choice of any
of the sense the sense included are the
Khloe love story Elizabeth and James
Nirvana white giorgio armani's see which
is amazing if you haven't smelled that
one who that's a good one marc jacobs
daisy dream stella mccartney's stella
and tory burch's signature scent now
this one made me a little bit upset a
couple of weeks ago someone mentioned to
me that they came out with the Sephora
bronze bears all set and then I
completely forgot about it the next week
I forgot about it again I was like you
know what I am buying this I'm going
online and I am buying it so i went
online and i bought it and i went to do
my research for what's of a make up this
week and it is now sold out and I'm like
oh because now I can't even review the
thing because no one can buy it it just
says bronze natural essentials and it
came with products from becca by beauty
formula x nars sephora collection tart
two-faced and urban decay and i'm sorry
i didn't get that one to you earlier it
just breaks my heart couple more kids
but not from Sephora favorites we have a
dr jart original BB set for $34 their
half-size versions of four of their
products they are the BB disappear
beauty balm the Black Label detox BB
beauty balm the premium beauty balm and
BBB radiance Beauty bone perricone md
also came out with a vault set it is
called the no makeup skincare limited
edition vault set it is two hundred and
fifty dollars which is a bunch of their
full size no makeup products I guess I
think it has a lot of skincare benefits
in their products I think that's why
it's called no makeup makeup here are
the products involved in that vault you
get the no foundation foundation serum
the no bronzer bronzer the no blush
blush the no highlighter
my lighter the no concealer concealer
the no mascara mascara the no lipstick
lipstick and the no lip gloss lip gloss
there's no shades listed for this so
that's that's a little odd to me but if
you look at the picture you can kind of
see if those colors will fit for you and
your skin tone Kate Somerville also has
a skincare set called the beautiful
indulgences gift set its eighty eight
dollars you get full sizes of the
Norrish hydrating firming missed the DLO
oil restorative treatment the Norris
daily moisturizer and they exfoliate
intensive exfoliator also tart has a
couple of sets there's a lot of stuff on
sale on the Sephora website from Tarte

sales on tarts website so if you love to
our products definitely check these out
the first one is the just cheeky deluxe

ambition it's on sale for twenty-six

cream a deluxe muse cheek stain and a
deluxe miracle oil all these sets I I'm
just the reporter bucks and as a have
glam will travel set its $19 you get a
mini hot escapes bronzer in Tahiti and
then a mini vanity lash mascara with a
full and fabulous brush roll on has
released a new version of their maxi
lash it's called so volume it's thirty
dollars it looks like it may not be a
brand new product but it's I've never
seen it once for website before so I'm
reporting it just in case just so you
know the mac / formula does have a
delicate floral fragrance so if you are
sensitive to that you may not want to
purchase this product Makeup Forever has
added some new colors to a couple of
their line first is the Aqua Matic I
shadow crayons there's five new shades
exclusive to sephora they have the
metallic gold and khaki the Diamonds
light turquoise the diamond peach the
matte black and the metallic pink
and then also in there aqua Rouge line
they have two new shades in cool candy
pink apricot pink and they are new and
exclusive to sephora dior has a new
diorshow brow gel it's very interesting
looking to me it has a click brush
applicator designed to release just the
right amount of a thin gel serum formula
ensuring you get your desired brow shape
with a lasting and lightweight
non-sticky finish there are three shades
for that product in transparent blonde
and brown butter london has a new trio
out and it is called the pretty neutral
nail lacquer trio there are three deluxe
sized polishes in Teddy girl which is an
opaque pale pink pink ribbon which is a
sheer pink and yummy mummy which is a
medium beige Serapeum he has a ton of
brushes at Sephora i'm not sure if these
are brand new this week but I've never
mentioned them in 17 makeup before so I
did want to mention them they are a
luxury Japanese handcrafted brush brands
so if you were looking for some luxury
brushes these are some options for you
they have the shadow brush petit the
shadow brush moyenne moyenne I'm going
to say shadow brush grande the artistic
smokey eye brush petites the smokey eye
brush grande the sculpting brush the
highlight brush and the face brush but
just so you know you're looking at at
least fifty dollars all the way up to
two hundred and thirty dollars for each
brush these are handcrafted takes a week
to make a brush kinds of brushes a
really neat free gift with purchase
they've got it ulta right now it's the
michael kors three piece gift set it
comes with a lip lacquer a nail polish
and then a little matchbook of three
different perfume samples the different
colors that you could get with that for
the lip lacquer or Dame bombshell or
diva the nail lacquer is audition in all
three of the choices and then the
matchbox fragrant sampler has glam
Jasmine sporty citrus and sexy amber as
the three cents in it and it doesn't
matter which lip you pair it up with but
I thought that was really neat so it's
free with any $50 ulta.com a purchase
laura geller has the hat
a beautiful collection it's online only
and it's $49 it comes with a spackle
hydrating under makeup primer a baked
blush and brighten entropic Hughes a big
shadow duo in honey sable and an
incredible waterproof gel eyeliner and
brown eyed girl and then a color luster
lip gloss in strawberry cream also
lancome has their bridal collection and
now at Ulta they have the bell DT and
bronzer the blush subtle CTO Xochitl and
the color design 5 pan I shadow palette
and these were designed with brides
specifically in mind also OPI has a
product this is the color paints
blendable nail lacquer it's a six piece
mini collection it comes with a silver
canvas base coat a yellow and orange a
pink a purple and a turquoise for $22
basically the concept is you put the
silver down and then you paint the
colors on in different designs and you
can kind of paint them like watercolors
which is kind of interesting we did see
this with the formula x brands couple of
weeks ago was it last week maybe two
weeks ago I can't remember with formula
X the formula x one has a full-size base
coat where the OPI one has a deluxe
sample you can get the full-size OPI one
though if you want to but the formula x
one has a yellow a pink a bluish purple
and a turquoise but it is also eight
dollars more expensive than the OPI
version so just a little comparison if
you're interested in trying that new
type of nail polish this has a beachy
keen set it's $42 it comes with their
new arm candy which reduces redness
helps provide a firmer smoother and more
toned appearance to your arms a fuzz off
foam body hair removal foam and the
height and glow sleek for fair to medium

able to find a couple of things and this
