happening in Canada I'm Jen from Genlis
reviews and what's a good makeup starts
right now welcome to what's a bit makeup
june fifth 2016 edition let's go ahead
and hop right into the top news of the
week recently 380 million people watch
Alicia Keys recent performance at the
champions league final they noticed
among other things that she performed
totally makeup-free the singer has now
written a blog to explain just why she's
chosen to stop wearing makeup and move
to a completely natural look she says we
all get to a point in our lives
especially girls where we try to be
perfect she says it's another moment
where you some piece of you realizes
that to fit in or be thought of as
beautiful you have to cover up to be a
bit closer to perfect after reflecting a
bit on her move to New York and time in
the recording industry she concludes I
don't want to cover up anymore not my
face not my mind not my soul not my
thoughts not my dreams not my struggles
my emotional growth nothing she is
therefore gone makeup-free when doing
the shoot for her new album and single
in common as well as in shoes for Vanity
Fair and fault magazine I hope to god
it's a revolution she wrote we think
she's gorgeous either way Health Canada
the National Public Health Department
and regulatory body of that country has
approved mgc pharmaceuticals anti-aging

different about that the collection is

strength anti-aging antioxidant and
autoimmune benefits derived from CBD to
encourage repair and rejuvenation in
addition to the skin care treatments we
are all accustomed to seeing the company
also offers stem cells and peptides eye

Administration approval of its first 16
