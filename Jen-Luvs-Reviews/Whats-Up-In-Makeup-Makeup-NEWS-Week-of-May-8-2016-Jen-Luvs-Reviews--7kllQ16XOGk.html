entrance and is it really finger lickin
good I'm Jen from Genlis reviews and
what's up and makeup starts right now
welcome to what's up and makeup may 8
2016 edition happy mothers today to
those who celebrate and for those that
are looking forward to the chat today
I'm gonna take the day off to spend some
time with my family for mothers day so I
apologized it will not be a what's been
makeup chat today but look forward to
one next week there will be a chat next
week at least that's what's in the plans
let's go ahead and get into the top
industry news of the week you might
remember a few months ago when it was
announced that Ruby Rose would be a
spokesperson for Urban Decay now on the
Urban Decay Facebook page we finally get
to see and add as well for the new vice
lipsticks Jerrod Blandino of two-faced
released a video a few days ago offering
his thanks to his fans for support and
pledging that he would do anything
possible to get peach pellets out as
soon as possible meanwhile HSN featured
the peach palette for sale and of course
it rapidly sold out and remember our
story from last week's show about Ulta
so keep your eye out if that happens to
be true or if you'd like to take
advantage I'm actually doing a giveaway
of the peach palette at what's up in
makeup calm go ahead and go there to
enter you can wait for the picture to
show up on the main screen once you see
the peach palette click and they'll tell
you how to enter the giveaway bath and
body works will be releasing a list on
Monday that's tomorrow of a small group
of 1990s arrow fragrances that they are
reviving for summer and thanks to our
intrepid reporter Nikki six five four
three we have learned that the
fragrances will probably be cucumber
melon brown sugar at fig mango mandarins
sun-ripened raspberry peony freesia
country apple and cotton blossom it
cosmetics will soon be coming to sephora
in September what's more to say we
cannot wait for this to happen and the
hottest news of the week if you like the
chicken leg soap we featured a few weeks
ago then you will love k
sees chicken-flavored nail polish that's
right chicken flavored nail polish it's
edible right now it's only in Hong Kong
we're not sure if it's going to get us
in the States BBC sent a reporter to
investigate and here's what they found
both polishes are indeed made of edible
ingredients with no preservatives each
bottle must be refrigerated and last for
less than a week in fact each bottles
instructions state that it is good for a
one-time use only the BBC report
continued that it does indeed taste like
KFC but the colors were transparent and
even after two coats still transparent
this is not at all like the polish in
the music video so I guess we can't have
our nail polish and eat it too our
