Nikki the dates for the vib sale so you
know Rouge is kind of the most the top
tier of the Sephora food chain then

questions about the sale one thing
that's very very important especially
for rouges to understand is you will not
be able to get your twenty percent off
during the VIP window like you could in
the past so make sure if you're a ruse
you get it during the Rouge window
regular VI bees during the vi v window
you want
I get it during the Rouge window so
