nail polish line KL polish say hello to
brick sidewalk and Zoe recently we told
you the cover girl is named 17 year old
James Charles as its first male
spokesmodel that seems to have sparked a
conversation on gender identity and what
constitutes masculinity and femininity
it's a hot topic lately sparking the
introduction of new pronouns and a push
for a bend in the gender rules despite
these changes new data from yougov shows
that the u.s. may not be ready to accept
men wearing makeup fifty percent of u.s.
adults polled believe it would be bad if
men started wearing makeup daily around
a third could go either way while only
eleven percent think men wearing makeup
is a good idea the study also revealed
that young people are far more open to
the idea of men wearing nail polish and
mascara than their older counterparts
another part of the study showed that
women were more open to men wearing
makeup them were other men speaking of
covergirl another youtuber nora Afiya
from the channel baby Leila

like what I can relate to with a lot of
Muslim girls as we've all felt insecure
about either being Muslim wearing a
hijab or just your culture at one point
