Jen from Genlis reviews and what's up
and makeup starts now welcome to what's
a bit makeup for november 20th 2016
let's start with some top industry news
and it's extra good this week the
biggest news of the week is the sale of
Two Face to the estee lauder companies
for 1.4 billion dollars this is the
lauder companies largest-ever
acquisition co-founders Jerrod Blandino
and Jeremy Johnson made a special
announcement on their YouTube channel
claiming that their 19 year old company
would not change rest assured that our
morals and values that we built two
faced on will never change we promise
you that we will never ever test on
animals the co-founders suggest they'll
remain involved in the brand are you
concerned that they'll start testing on
animals or that the parent company does
tests on animals has this changed your
opinion of two-faced tell us in the
comments down below inspired by her
grandmother's love for red lipstick
Renata helfman of Los Angeles is
bringing joy to the faces of cancer
patients in Los Angeles she started
lipstick angels in 2012 a nonprofit
organization that brings volunteer
makeup artists into hospitals to pamper
patients with facials makeovers and
massage treatments she uses only natural
and organic products it kind of becomes
I have an appointment for a facial
rather than I'm going to the hospital
for chemo Tony a patient who did not
disclose her last name for privacy told
foxnews.com I was transported from a
place that is clinical with people being
treated in cubicles and suddenly I could
look across and see the lipstick angel
working with someone and you see joy
it's a sweet and comforting alternative
treatment helpmann adds these out
patients are going out into the world
again they pick up a mirror and they see
themselves they don't see a cancer
patient lipstick Angels has served over
2,500 patients with programs in los
angeles long beach and new york city
they hope to expand to at least one more
location in both New York and Los
Angeles in 2017 for those interested

selling a themed stocking in a makeup
bag products officially dropped tomorrow
monday at 1pm and features free domestic
shipping for that day only imagine this
you walk into sephora you see these
brand new lipsticks that you probably
won't buy maybe you're wondering if
they're worth the hype you take one of
the testers off the shelf and swatch it
on your hand or maybe ask someone on
staff to apply it to your lips or maybe
just maybe you apply it to your lips
yourself but is this safe no skin should
ever touch any of the testers said
baylor college of medicine medical
esthetician Kim and Shang during an
interview with Houston news channel to
the biggest concerns according to Chang
are
have strep and e.coli from people who
have used the bathroom not wash their
hands and dip their fingers into the
products she faults the general public
as well as the stores who have no real
regulations for makeup testers according
to channel 2 news Chang says specialists
are trained to sanitize beauty products
by scraping swabbing and dispensing on a
tissue to save you from these germs she
suggests tapping the powders onto a
tissue using only what's on the tissue
and scraping a layer of lipstick on to a
disposable tool she suggests testing
products on your hand only and never put
them on your eyes further see suggest
asking for samples when available in
