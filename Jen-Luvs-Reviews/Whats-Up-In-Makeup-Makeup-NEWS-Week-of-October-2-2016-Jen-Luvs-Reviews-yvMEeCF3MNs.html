big whoops I'm Jen from Genlis reviews
and what's up in makeup starts now
welcome to what's it been makeup for
October second 2016 here's what's going
on in the top industry news have you
seen color pops contour sticks helping
to check out the names and see anything
strange and maybe downright offensive
the contrast is more than skin deep when
you name a lighter shade something happy
like gummy bear a castle and darker
shades after mistakes like yikes and
typos and a statement released a
BuzzFeed color pop said on behalf of
colour pop we are sorry and are
extremely grateful for our customers
feedback we've taken immediate action to
change the shade names and review our
naming process to ensure this does not
happen again the colours have promptly
been renamed yikes has become bloom and
typo has become platonic is this change
a little too little too late leave your
thoughts in the comments below the 2016
united states presidential race went
into full swing with the republican
democrat face off on September 26 and
some viewers went ham on Trump not for
his stance on race relations before his
contour we know Trump is no stranger to
the bronzer brush but for this event as
makeup artist instead reached for a
slimming effect of a contour or tried to
singer Mindy white tweeted someone
please tell Trump his highlight and
contour isn't doing him any favors while
drag queen lady bunny commented I had no
idea Trump's makeup team watched
RuPaul's Drag Race and too bad he missed
the episode on wig styling before you
shake all this off consider this
according to Mike calm and dr. John
Freeman an assistant professor in the
Department of Psychology at New York
University he said in an email the
utility of cosmetics for male facial
appearance could include increasing
perceptions of health and vitality such
as through evening out the skin tricky
move Trump nice try ever gets so
frustrated with your lack of makeup
skill that you just want to give up well
don't you can do it and this woman
proves it Caitlin
brow contracted bacterial meningitis in
2013 resulting in an amputation of all
four limbs did this stop her from
achieving full fleek nope Caitlin
started her makeup tutorial Channel four

include a grunge look smokey eye and
winged liner due to her skill with a
brush and her fantastic attitude Kailyn
