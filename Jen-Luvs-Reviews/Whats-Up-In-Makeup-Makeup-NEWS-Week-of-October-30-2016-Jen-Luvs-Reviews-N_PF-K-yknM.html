raises your beauty IQ and putting on
makeup in public is taboo I am I linea
the benevolent goddess of makeup and the
perfect wing behold what's it been
makeup starts now welcome to what's up
and make up for October thirtieth 2016
our second Halloween edition here's
what's in top industry news this week
before you put no name brand Halloween
makeup on you or your children hear this
a new study by the Breast Cancer Fund
tested Halloween specialty makeup and
the results are shocking out of the 48
makeup palettes tested almost half
contained toxic heavy metals and nearly
twenty percent of the palettes contain
lead and cadmium the study also found
that some products contain chemicals
such as arsenic and chromium the bcf
found that the darker the pigment the
higher concentration of lead as you know
lead is very dangerous at any level is
especially dangerous for children as
many of these makeup items do not list
ingredients unaware parents are
purchasing these products and putting
them on their children you may be
surprised to know that the FDA does not
regulate this type of product at all now
on to international news cultural
etiquette about when and where makeup
should be applied varies from country to
country a Japanese add however caused
quite a stir by criticizing women who
apply makeup on drains according to
Japan today the video is one of four
made by Tokyo as part of an awareness
campaign on passenger etiquette launched
this fall but only the makeup version
has triggered controversy on the
internet the other three videos relate
to smartphone use jumping in front of
others who are in line and carrying
large bags and crowded compartments in
the video a woman is seen looking
annoyed at passengers putting on makeup
she then wraps what translates to be why
can't she do that before leaving home
and your eyebrows restored and eyelashes
multiplied your transformation is
witnessed ending her rant with please
refrain from putting on makeup in trains
one person asked why are they being
criticized for doing something that
causes no harm to others another person
I said that there are passengers who
were much bigger nuisances such as
drunks and groper
okay I'm going off script for a second
that's insane like I I drunks and
gropers that is a really that that's
really really bad people who defend the
video say that women who put on makeup
on the train cause harm by staining
other passengers clothing they also
suggest that the makeup transformation
is a private act and should not be done
in public a Tokyo spokesman said that
they have actually received more
positive feedback about the makeup ad
than negative and he added that the
railway has no plans to withdraw the ad
in addition to housewares electronics
and laser powered hair stimulators QVC
is one of the biggest players in the
beauty game so it's not really surprise
to us that they're launching their own
beauty channel called Beauty IQ the new
network set to go live on October
thirty-first will feature live
programming five nights a week with the
rest of its schedule rounded out by
recorded Beauty centric segments all
beauty all the time special sizes kits
favorite lines you can expect to see
them all or can you word has it that the
new channel will concentrate on for
Steve beauty brands like it cosmetics
tart Becca Josie Maran Angie vashi 40
million US homes will have the
experience on providers such as directv
and dish with even more exposure through
beauty iq com there are truly endless
number of skin tones in the world but
women with deeper complexions have often
felt underrepresented by makeup brands
belanda at ease wants to change all of
that at East is a chemist that manages
the L'Oreal USA women of color lab in
New Jersey a haitian-american at East
says finding a foundation is the
greatest struggle when speaking of the
beauty industry at East stated although
we are excited to see the effort being
made we did notice that there was still
the concern of the shades either being
too ashy to read and they just didn't
cover a large segment of the population
and response at East and her team
traveled across the United States and
internationally to gather skin tone
measurements to make sure that the
shades created were suitable for a large
range of skin tones they found a
colorant called ultramarine blue that
allowed makeup to go deeper without
sacrificing the natural color of the
skin hopefully we will see the fruits of
it eases labor in our stores soon after
receiving criticism for her
collaboration with morphe kathleenlights
announced during a video that she is
done collabing with companies for a
while instead she is working on more
personal products that
not be discussed at the moment during
the video while discussing this she
places her hand on her chest that
continues to move toward her neck while
giving the impression she's trying to
hint at what it may be is it the nail
polish she's wearing the shirt or
something with the neck itself who knows
