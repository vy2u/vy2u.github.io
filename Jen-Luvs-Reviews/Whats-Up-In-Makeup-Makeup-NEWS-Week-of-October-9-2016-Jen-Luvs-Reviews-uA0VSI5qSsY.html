from Genlis reviews and what's up a
makeup starts now welcome to what's oven
makeup for october 19 2016 it's been a
busy week so let's get started with some
top industry news let's take a moment to
consider lime crime after a history of
controversy the brand was starting to
pick up again until users started
reporting alleged brown spots on the
brand's new super foil shadows claiming
they were everything from mold to rust
Lime Crime reps have responded to the
posters with explanations and also hired
a third-party lad to perform independent
testing however the super foils have
been pulled off the market for now could
it be anything crazier than the online
launch of the Salina and that collection
absolutely the in-store release of the
Salina and Matt collection in the
evening hours of October fifth women and
men lined up with their mentally spent
cash waiting for stores to open the next
morning Chicago Selena fan Christina
Alonso was quoted to say I love Selena
my husband said take water take a chair
but I said I just need this pen for
protection while Christina waited in
Chicago dedicated husband Mark Ramirez
waited with hundreds of people in a
dallas line at the request of his wife
hopefully all of the spouses who saw
their bank accounts lose a couple
hundred dollars on thursday will agree
with mark when he stated happy wife
happy life didn't get yours mac sent out
a tweet saying they intend on restocking
the collection so keep a lookout on the
mac website a few weeks ago we told you
about the dubai masterclass by Kim
Kardashian west on october fourteenth
due to the robbery that took place
during paris fashion week the master
class will need to be rescheduled
kardashian-west makeup artist mario d
devon avec apologized in an email to

contestants Samantha Lavery was
presented with a strange request before
her song remove her makeup judge Simon
Cowell no stranger to an honest approach
took one look at seventeen-year-old
Lavery and stated I'd almost like to see
you without so much makeup he said all
I'm saying is I want to peel away the
mask at this request Lavery left
returning later with a natural makeup
look after being praised for her
physical beauty Lavery received high
praise for her voice Cowell commenting
it was like we were meeting you for the
first time did Simon do the right thing
by asking Samantha to remove her makeup
leave your thoughts in the comments
below what would you say if I said there
existed a smart near that find your
flaws but also prints makeup to fix them
no this is not the Sephora on the
enterprise but a real product in
development by Panasonic its face and
skin analyzing smart mirror detects skin
blemishes sun damage spots wrinkles and
more then the mirror sends that data to
a makeup printer that spits out a thin
layer of makeup match to your own skin
tone in roughly two minutes once printed
it needs to take about a day to dry and
settle before it can be applied to a
person's face then the makeup layer is
placed on the face sprayed with water
and gently smooth out the water soon
evaporates and you're left with a makeup
application similar to a temporary
tattoo supposedly it feels more natural
the longer you wear it the product is
still a prototype of panasonic has hopes
that it could be used to cover scar
tissue and tattoos as well in events
