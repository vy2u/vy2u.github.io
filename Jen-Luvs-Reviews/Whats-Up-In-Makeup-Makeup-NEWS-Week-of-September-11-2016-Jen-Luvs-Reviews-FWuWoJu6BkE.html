makes a New York date and Kat Von D
she's just really great I'm Jen from
Genlis reviews and what's up and makeup
starts now welcome to what's up and make
up for September 11th 2016 let's start
with the top industry news julep
recently settled a lawsuit with the
Washington State Attorney's Office over
deceptive business practices the lawsuit
dealt with complaints received between
2012 and 2015 which were brought after
consumers had difficulty canceling
subscriptions according to the AG as a
promotion julep offered a free welcome
box consumers had to provide a credit or
debit card for shipping and taxes
however in the time period covered by
the lawsuit the company did not
adequately disclose that consumers were
also enrolling in its maven subscription
plan disclosures regarding the
subscription and cancellation terms were
buried in web checkout pages that the
consumer was unlikely to see at the AG
said but Jane Park the company's founder
and CEO is disputing details released by
the AG's office last Tuesday even saying
that the characterization of the
settlement was unethical and deceptive
Park says julep issued 1.5 million
dollars in refunds to consumers before
ever being contacted by the AG's office
she says juleps only penalty paid in
relation to the settlement was a
$250,000 legal fee to close the matter
she says I started julep out of a
passion for transforming the beauty
experience and encouraging women to
experiment outside their comfort zones
I'm grateful for each and every one of
our customers full details of the story
are available at GeekWire com this week
