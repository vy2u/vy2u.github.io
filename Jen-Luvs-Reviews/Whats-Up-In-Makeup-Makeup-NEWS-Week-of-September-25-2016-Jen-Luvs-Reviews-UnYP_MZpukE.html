stay tuned a lot of women wear makeup to
work but would you be okay with a rule
that required you to wear makeup every
day 23 year old Brenna McPhee of Toronto
decided to skip out on her interview at
the body shop when she learned that
wearing a full face of makeup was part
of the dress code in an email response
to the body shop she said I chose not to
come as I was deeply turned off by the
prospect of working for your company the
fact that you require female interview
candidates not even employees to wear
full face of make
is very problematic we realized that
while our audience loves makeup we
uphold the rights of those who choose
not to wear a full-face or any at all
beauty vlogger Breland
of glitter forever 17 has stepped out of
the box for a beauty video way out of
the box so far out of the box that she
did a full face of makeup using only
non-toxic nail polish though we're
dealing cautions multiple times not to
try this at home the comments section is
splattered with critiques of her actions
especially since the video has begun to
gain media attention those subscribers
are threatening to have her video take
it off of YouTube and of course
unsubscribe this twenty-eight-year-old
previous NYX face awards testing
