hello my friends this is jen from jen
loss reviews and you are watching what's
up in a makeup welcome back just to
remind it a head over to the what's at
the makeup website and hang out on our
brand new form and be one of the first
users over there starting threads and
having great conversations also to let
you know our featured youtube user of
the week is the plainest Jane she is
absolutely amazing I will be linking her
channel down below and also on the
what's up a makeup website and if you're
curious of what's on my face the
exclusive video will is located on the
what's of the makeup website and now on
to the news here we go number one top
story of the week is a bug in the Beauty
Blender story there is a UK youtuber
named Stevie Miller who claims to have
found bugs in her beauty blender there's
a whole video of her extracting these
bugs from the Beauty Blender that I
think it's definitely worth a watch if
nothing else for the comedic purposes
she spends a while chopping up her
beauty blender hunting out and picking
out all of these bugs the entertainment
value of this video is amazing so she's
screaming about the bugs having licensed
gun mags it's got legs and then she's on
the phone with her mom and her mom's
telenor not to hurt the bugs because
they're living creatures but the best
thing is the one-liner when she stops
and she starts talking about how her
bugs are illegal immigrants who have
smuggled their way into her country
through the beauty blender and I about
died I lost it but her delivery of it is
amazing and I strongly suggest that you
go ahead and go over there and watch the
video it's absolutely hilarious whether
it's real or not I have no idea but it's
funny now an actual makeup nudes urban
