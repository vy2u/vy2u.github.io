schooled in civics and one lesson
everyone needs to learn I'm Jen from Jen
Lowe's reviews and what's been makeup
starts now welcome to what's been makeup
for August 20th 2017 we've got a
thunderstorm happening outside but it's
going to be carrying on for the next few
hours so I'm just going to shoot right
through it but if you hear some rain
some thunder and lightning everything's
okay as long as the power doesn't go out
then we're in some serious trouble but
until then let's go ahead and get into
some top industry news it's that secret
that we're all going to get older the
big question is how are we going to
handle it are you going to fight it or
do you see yourself like a fine bottle
of wine allures editor-in-chief
announced in September edition that the
term anti-aging will no longer be used
in Allure magazine going on to say
whether we know it or not we're subtly
reinforcing the message that aging is a
condition we need to battle and why
should that be when there are so many
women out there that have proven with
age that they only get better Helen
Mirren Jennifer Aniston Jennifer Lopez
the list goes on all the more reason to
take another quote from allure to heart
growing older is a wonderful thing
because it means that we get a chance
every day to live a full happy life most
makeup lovers have heard about unique
and their 3d fiber lashes mascara and
it's very mixed reviews one customer not
only dislikes the product but it's filed
a claim in court that she and many
others were misled by the company megan
schmidt alleges that the company
misrepresented the product by claiming
that the fibers were natural unique
labeled and marketed the mascara with
claims that it had 100% green tea fibers
but that claim is false as the mascara
does not in fact have any green tea
fibers in it instead it has ground-up
nylon which is by no means natural the
suit claims that with these
misrepresentations that company misled
customers and that is a violation of
many laws throughout the u.s. Schmidt is
not only seeking justice for herself but
also others who
feel they have fallen victims the
company's deceit the suit is requesting
for all affected to be rewarded
monetarily including punitive damages as
well as any cost incurred during the
proceedings we will keep you posted new
on the elf website the brush finder the
brush finder prompts you to pop in the
answer to three questions in the style
of Mad Libs it will then offer the best
choice of four brushes for you it is my
way to play around while you're waiting
for the next episode of Game of Thrones
this item comes under the heading of
things we can't believe we have to
report again you've probably seen some
variation on the old April Fool's joke
that uLTA Beauty is closing as a result
of being bought out by Sephora newsflash
it's not true but this time the story
takes on a darker twist it starts with a
Facebook ad that references the Ulta
rumor and then asks if you would like to
receive free or extremely reduced price
products buyer beware because in each
case the ad leads to the same place a
company called tranquil eye cream
located in California and Utah selling
its products at a discounted rate that's
it nothing related to alter Sephora it's
a total clickbait and perpetuates rumors
about brands unrelated to their own the
company behind those ads has not
responded to any of the claims against
their shady marketing practices but the
moral the story once again is this don't
always believe everything you see on the
internet and always look for
verification from the stores themselves
before diving into those great offers
when you hear the brand name Burt's Bees
you mostly think of their popular lip
balms and skin care items just last year
they launched lipsticks with huge
success and now the company is creating
some buzz get it the new visa welcomed
