Katy give up Sparkle and Smashbox gives
us the finger I'm Jen from Jen Lowe's
reviews and what the bin makeup starts
now welcome to what have been makeup for
August sixth 2017 let's get started with
the top industry news not long ago
Anasazi of Beverly Hills cosmetics was
known only for their amazing brow
products but with eyeshadow palette
releases such as the master palette by
Mario and then now legendary modern
renaissance palette a BH showed everyone
that they were a force to be reckoned
with in the eyeshadow market the
long-awaited release of the modern
renaissance sister palette called
subculture happened on July 25th
followed very soon by a plethora of
reviews on YouTube there's one big
consensus the shadows are abnormally
powdery the first person to our
knowledge to point this out with a very
disappointed ELISA Ashley as of today if
you search YouTube for subculture
appellate review you'll see some nail
after thumbnail clearly expressing
disappointment in the quality of the
palette so what is abh act to say about
this president Claudius or also known as
noir Venus stated that this was their
first time using an automatic pressing
machine when the shadows aren't pressed
hard enough the result is a dusty mess
the question is what is abh doing about
this will this be a continuing problem
where is there hope for subculture a BH
says customers can feel free to return
their palettes for a full refund if you
ordered within the US you can use the
return label enclosed with your order
you'll receive email notification once
the return has been received and the
refund will be issued within 7 to 10
business days as for future subculture
palettes nor vino assured customers on
Twitter that future palettes will be
pressed harder for your thoughts on
subculture do you feel a BH is handling
the situation well and what are your
thoughts about ordering this palette
we'd love to know in the comments below
it's official desi Perkins and Katie de
Groot also known as lustre luxe are
collabing with dose of colors on some
beautiful products the collection will
include two highlighters
I shadow palette and five lip products

gloss prices range from $15 to $18 for

highlighters are also $28 and are
described as champagne golden shades
official launch date is August 14 here's
a story that starts and ends with
fingers foundation wares are always
looking for a new hot tool to achieve
the flawless airbrushed look they may
have started with their fingers then
brushes and sponges and maybe even the
silicone sponges now Smashbox has
designed yet another silicone sponge
with a twist get up close and you will
see little ridges all over it in centric
patterns so now we've gone from fingers
and you're leading sponges to sponges
that emulate fingers could this $20
sponge change your foundation game YSL
is receiving some backlash from people
of color regarding the shade range of
their new all our foundation looking at
this photo is apparent the deeper skin
tones have been left out of production
after some confrontation on Instagram
the brand responded with this thank you

important to us and we take it very
seriously we are pleased to let you know
that five new darker shades are already
set to join the range next year
