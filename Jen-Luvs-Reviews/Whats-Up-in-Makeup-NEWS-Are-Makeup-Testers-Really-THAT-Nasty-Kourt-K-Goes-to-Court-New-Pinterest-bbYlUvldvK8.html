worse courtney case says it's time to
converse and pinterest takes a tip from
the google verse I'm Jen from Jen Lowe's
reviews and what if a makeup starts now
welcome to what's up and makeup for May
6th 2018 let's get started with the top
industry news an independent lab
recently analyzed swab samples for
PopSugar
and proved the point that we've all been
dreading mega testers are dirtier than
toilet seats the CFU or the colony
forming unit describes the magnitude of
bacteria growth within the sample
topping the list at 98,000 CF use was
the eye liner tester followed by the
mascara tester at 30 mm CF use and for
reference a toilet seat is about 27 CF
use let's take a moment to wrap our
brains around that that means the
testers Harbor about 1,200 to 3,600
times more CF use than the toilet seats
tested we cannot stress this point
enough please protect yourself to
prevent the spread of bacteria or
potential illness please keep testers
away from your eyes and mouth and
utilize virtual try on options of
available speaking of swatching vegan
friendly nail polish brand lb k just
made shopping for your next manicure
shade just a little bit easier their
bottles are designed with a swatch on
the cap you lift the swatch and then
rest the top of your nail on it to take
the color for a test drive
lb k's new line has 48 shades for $10
each now here's another PSA from us to
you because we live in a polluted world
exposure to air pollution can lead to
acne or clogged pores that's right it
may not be the Hershey bar you ate it
may actually be your city air several
skincare steps can help mitigate
pollution based skin issues also
remember to take protective measures
such as applying sunscreen and
antioxidants and barrier building
skincare products and always cleanse
well after a day in the same
so now you know and knowing is half the
battle and when you're researching that
skincare think about this there is more
to skincare brand bioscience than the
calming packaging designs and natural
formulations every item in the line is
approved by the Environmental Working
Group the brand also sources innovative
ingredients they harvest squalene from
sugar instead of from other plants or
sharks and the products are wrapped up
in recyclable dye-free containers
bioscience is committed to campaigning
for better cosmetic and skincare product
regulation through their relationship
with ewg they join a lot of brands on
this eco-friendly movement so when you
see their luxury price tag you might
know why and who else is working with
ewg none other than Kourtney Kardashian
she joined the environmental working
group in Washington DC to support their
hashtag beauty made Better campaign the
campaign supports the personal care
product Safety Act which would give the
FDA the power to determine if a product
is safe and recall products that are
deemed unsafe Kourtney's presence at the
campaign turned the heads of broadcast
news and online media alike she posted
her support on Instagram saying quote I
went to Capitol Hill with environmental
working group yesterday to advocate for
safer personal care products because
everyone including children deserve to
be protected from chemicals in their
products that we know cause harm it's
time for Congress to do its job stand
with me and take action today
improvements that Pinterest will soon
help you curate your makeup board you'll
soon be able to filter beauty searches
by skin tone the unique search is
similar to the one used in food searches
where users can filter based on dietary
needs a little extra code and voila
Pinterest uses a third-party AI
technology called motto phase to provide
the algorithms necessary to narrow
searches the beta tests will be rolled
out to users on the Pinterest mobile and
desktop version soon have you ever
wished you could develop your own lip
balm flavor when lip smackers tastemaker
competition and the prize could be yours
the winner of the taste maker
competition will land a lip
development deal with the product to be
sold exclusively on lip smacker calm
submit your ideas to taste maker dot lip
smacker combine a ninth just a little
note that will never be a lip smacker
better than dr. pepper but please feel
free to try when you put moss on your
face what if it claimed to protect your
face from pollution and boasted skincare
benefits my belt biochemistry has
developed a biotechnology grown
botanical moss called moss cell tech
number one the company claims quote
mosses filter all the necessary in
nutrients from the air and rain they
also accumulate air pollution particles
such as heavy metals and in order not to
poison themselves mosses have a large
set of antioxidants to mitigate the
effects of accumulating toxic compounds
the sustainable resources grown in the
lab to keep up with cosmetic grade
standards and maybe an upcoming trend in
the skincare industry it begs the
question would you only work on the
north side of your face we know that
target has just bumped up its indy
profile with a makeup aisle and now
target is looking to boost
representation of their hair and
skincare startup companies with their
take off series the retail giant hosted
ten companies at their minneapolis
headquarters for a week-long summit
aimed to help the startups boost their
sales chops the companies were then sent
back to work to develop a sales pitch to
get their products on target shelves oh
my gosh the pressure targets
specifically focused on women-owned
startups and companies with diverse
product lines to start the take off
series uk-based drugstore boots has
pulled an eyeshadow palette from shelves
after multiple complaints from women who
deemed it unsuitable for their teenage
daughters made by makeup revolution the
obsessive eyes palette retailed for
twelve pounds
for twenty four shadows and appealing
cost for bargain hunters and teenagers
the palette contained shade names such
as milf wasted dealer and sugar daddy
and those are the ones we can report on
concerned mom Angela stated with a
palette price at 12 pounds it's not just
people my daughter's age will be buying
this it's younger girls I complained to
boots and they replied that it was not
marketed at children but I don't think
that makes a difference
makeup revolution up
apparently already had plans to rename
the shades ASAP a representative from
boot stated quote this complaint has
made us accelerate our plan and we will
remove this product obsessive eyes from
stores and online with immediate effect
now do you feel that price point matters
when it comes to the naming of makeup
shades let us know in the comments next
time you're strolling through Los
Angeles International Airport be sure to
look for the new a la Prairie retail
space the marble-like black and chrome
three-part stand features interactive
touch points
featuring animated displays high-profile
promotions and a custom la prairie
animated film this encourages travelers
to interact with the brand from the
moment they enter engaging customers
providing space to try samples and
receive consultations the retail space
location is key as it captures the most
visibility for la Prairie and reaches
its target audience of affluent
travelers Avon is ramping up their
smarter beauty ad campaign in the UK and
is using it to go after one of the
largest brands in the cosmetic industry
mac the campaign shows a model with Mac
products applied to the left side of her
face comparable to Avon products applied
to the right side the cost comparison of
the products is listed and the tagline
is quote we believe Premium Beauty
doesn't have to come with a big price
tag there is a better option a smarter
option Avon Avon is you see the ads help
customers be smarter with their cosmetic
purchases stating that a woman on
average spends about twenty-two thousand
pounds that's just under $30,000 a u.s.
on makeup products in their lifetime
Avon is use this ad strategy before on
another Estee Lauder company when it
made a side-by-side comparison of an
Avon lipstick to a clinic lipstick this
past week Hawaii lawmakers passed a bill
prohibiting the sale of sunscreen
containing oxybenzone and Octonauts
eight scientists have found that the two
substances commonly found in many
sunscreens can be toxic to coral which
is a vital part of the ocean ecosystem
and a draw for tourists in Hawaii
consumers would only be allowed to buy
sunscreen with the chemicals under
prescription though the measure itself
doesn't ban online purchases or tour
from bringing in their own if Hawaii
Governor EJ signs the bill the law go
into effect starting in 2021 at Hawaii
we become the first state to enact such
legislation a similar bill failed to
pass last year after it pitted
environmental scientists against
businesses and trade groups that benefit
from the giant market of Sun care
products in the United States worth more
than two billion dollars a year
Democratic Senator Mike Gabbard who
introduced the measure shared with the
Honolulu Star advisor quote amazingly
this is a first in the world law so
Hawaii is definitely on the cutting edge
by banning these dangerous chemicals in
sunscreens when you think about it our
island paradise surrounded by coral
reefs is the perfect place to set the
gold standard for the world to follow
it's often said that no good deed goes
unpunished but this one has a happy
ending imagine for a moment you are
makeup artist and Nicola Gordon Jones on
the way home from a makeup course taught
by award-winning Bridal artist Christina
gas for us you see your stop approaching
stand up and reach for your bag but it's
missing your bag with your entire kit
along with your DSLR camera valuing over
four thousand dollars it's just plain
gone Gordon Jones stated that the
experience was quote absolutely
devastating as it contained everything I
had built up over the years now cut to a
few train stops earlier where educator
Lauren Costello reaches her stop grabs
for her bag and adds the Train only to
realize that she's made a terrible
mistake and now has the wrong bag
Costello turned the back over to the
Lost and Found department at the train
station but she didn't stop there upon
returning home Costello posted a plea on
Facebook asking for help in locating the
mystery makeup artist amazingly a friend
of Gordon Jones saw Costello's post in a
makeup artist Facebook group and as a
result she was reunited with her prized
kit oh and Costello got her own bag back
too but the story doesn't end there as a
reward for her efforts and honesty
Costello was offered a free makeup
session and photoshoot with Christina
gasps Burris herself makeup artist Kevin
James Bennett recently posted on his
Instagram about a statement by Estee
Lauder company CEO Fabrizio fretta
according to Bloomberg
during a conference call with investors
fredda stated quote we recently learned
that some testing related to certain
products advertising claims had been
intentionally altered for some time by a
small group of employees the company is
in the process of retesting the products
in question to ensure that the claims
stated in advertising and on the
packaging are accurate but the names of
the products affected were not revealed
fretta apologized and also stated that
there were no safety issues regarding
these products but some of the company's
product claims will be changed and
speaking of claims that should not be
made
blah blah blah Revlon blah blah blah
what can I say
they're still there our viewers have
been asking if it's only Foundation and
if it's just the one brand we've seen
other foundations in previous reports
and here's some almay that recently
joined the crew but it does extend to
other products these products are all
found on shelves and they are all very
much expired let's take this tube of
Maybelline blushing beige in lip Secours
it's almost old enough to vote
well maybe not really but it's 5 it's 5

some of the cosmetic companies as well
