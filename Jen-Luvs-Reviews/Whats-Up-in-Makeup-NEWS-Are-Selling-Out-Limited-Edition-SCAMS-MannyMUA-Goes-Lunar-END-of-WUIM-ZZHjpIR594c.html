shoots for the moon and changes are
coming soon I'm Jen from Jen Lowe's
reviews and what's up and makeup starts
now welcome to what's up and makeup for
december 31st 2017 happy new year let's
get started with the top industry news
due to heavy demands of their
much-sought-after skincare products a
glossier has partnered with an outside
vendor to help meet demands of their
loyal customers capacity a u.s.
ecommerce fulfillment company will be
responsible for shipping glossier
products from dedicated satellite and
packing stations and shipping terminals
while maintaining quality control
capacities work with glossier previously
during their 2014 launch of their online
only beauty start-up company they have
strong history of partnering with beauty
brands including tart and Becca glossy
eight will need the extra hands as they
launched in the United Kingdom this past
October and have plans to expand in
France in 2018 when you ask any makeup
addict where is the best place to shop
you'll hear Sephora Ulta Kohl's yes the
place we love to spend our Kohl's cash
has been building up their beauty
department by adding top known brands
such as the Baum Pargo
pure cosmetics and bliss in 2016 the
stores added professionally trained
beauty advisors to all stores for 2018
the retailer has hired a new vice
president and divisional merchandise
manager of beauty his name is Bob J's
offski who previously assisted Belk
department stores and bringing in brands
like Urban Decay what this means for
Kohl's and those looking for another
place to purchase their beauty products
still remains to be seen but it does
give all of us something to look forward
to it most likely came as no surprise
that Mannie MUA announced on Christmas
Day via his Instagram and Twitter page
that he is in fact launching his own
cosmetics company coming in 2018 along
with the announcement a mani shared the
lunar Beauty Instagram link where the
new page quickly grew to 70,000
followers within hours it follows the
belief stated on his IG page quote I
think boys deserve just as
much cosmetics recognition by adding to
the growing inclusivity that we see
happening in the industry while not
sharing exactly what to expect in the
form of products Manny did share on his
snapchat that fans can expect the brand
to be quote ethereal magical whimsical
pretty and quirky the brand has been
said have been worked on for years which
leaves the impression that a whole lot
of love and effort has been invested the
brand's logo has since been shared and
has received over 104 thousand likes we
will update you on new products as the
information becomes available picture
this you hear the news of a new product
or line coming out then anxiously wait
for the launch set alarms and reminders
on your phone stalk the site and then
what happens you get a site that has
crashed or a page announcing that they
are already sold out this is the exact
aggravating scenario that has been
played out over and over again this past
year with what seems to be no end in
sight the real question is why the first
thing to realize is that cosmetics is a
business there to make money one of the
main strategies most companies employ is
manufactured scarcity this plan is often
the one used when you hear the words
limited edition or limited time if you
believe the supply is small then it
builds anticipation and hence creates a
sell out the companies are probably
already planning to restock the items in
the future
sometimes these items are actually made
in-house and could be made permanent at
any time but leaving them as limited
makes for a better profit it's a
marketing plan that has been used with
great success over time and is relied on
to rake in the cash and it all comes
down to simple math if a company only
produces 5000 units and they can sell
out in ten minutes
they are making more profit compared to
producing 37,000 units and having 10,000
of those sitting on a shelf after a
launch all tactics aside there are times
that companies actually sell out of
product for a brand to keep up with the
demand they have to be able to produce
an item at a fast rate and that is
dependent on whether the brand can
produce in-house or if they have to
outsource producing an in-house can say
4 to 12 weeks on waiting for restocks
for more on this we can ask two-faced
about their peach palette problems in
2016 but with more companies
using items in local houses like see
beauty in Southern California which
supplies brands such as k'kaw Beauty
Kylie cosmetics and color pop and has
the capacity to whip out products
seemingly on the run why do we still see
sellouts only one answer for that and it
goes back to the earlier mentioned
strategy create FOMO and the consumers
will flock to the sites spend their
hard-earned money and for what
bottom-line for consumers pay attention
to the hype and you will see exactly why
you have such a hard time getting your
hands on certain items better yet
skip the hype just wait a few weeks and
you'll probably get another chance we
see more headlines every day about how
something is harming our beautiful
planet it leaves many people wondering
what they can do in their everyday
beauty routine to possibly help reduce
the destruction Unilever whose brands
you probably already know and use and
don't even realize it has now made it
possible for you to reduce your
footprint easily and affordably through
your beauty routine starting this month
drugstores will be carrying a new line
of hair and body products called love
beauty and planet and eco-friendly
beauty line the creation of this line
marks the first time ever that a major
corporation considered and built in
every single factor surrounding a
product from naturally sourced
ingredients to the recyclable packaging
as well as applied science that will
allow shorter shower times with better
rinse out technology
first up fragrances in the new line were
infused using ethically sourced extracts
and oils which offer up an elevated
sensory experience second the formulas
which have been proven and testing to
reduce rinse time of about twenty
percent that in turn reduces the amount
of water you're using each time you
shower third the packaging where every
single label is easily removable from
the 100% recyclable plastic bottle
altogether the line will have eight body
and eight teen hair products ranging
from $3 to $9 they'll be divided into
six collections each having up to five
products that deal with issues such as
dry skin or frizzy hair the goal is to
help parrot on your routine and join the
minimalist trend that helps out the
environment beauty independent reporter
Rachel Brown has looked into her crystal
ball and shared a list of bold
predictions for the beauty world in 2018
overall the themes are support small and
wellness will mingle with beauty let's
take a closer look at what she predicts
female business owners will increase
solidarity to help build their brands
boosting marketing efforts with service
providers and agencies who specialize in
working with smaller brands there may be
more collaboration between ande brands
and large legacy brands and ande brands
will also connect with various health
focused brick-and-mortar stores yep like
coffee shops and juice bars to sell
their products brands will promote self
care products that encourage unplugging
from technology until it's time to shop
in which case you may see an increase in
chat bots voice based commerce for
online shopping and a focus on better
customer service
there'll be an increase in Shae ranges a
direct influence from the boom of fenty
along with indie brands increasing
loyalty programs to use positive
word-of-mouth reviews to spread the word
and most interestingly a prediction that
brands will encourage consumers to
reduce beauty items used and focus on
more impactful products to that and an
increase in using local ingredients in
beauty products seems likely with
clearer ingredient labels instead of
general claims like natural or organic
far less use of palm oils and an
increase of natural deodorant options in
social media she predicts an overall
movement of effortless makeup looks that
move away from the heavy-handed
Instagram beauty trend and trends
changing more frequently as brands
diversify their products and finally
with the closing of the year we have
some changes to tell you about this will
be the last whatsapp in makeup as you
know it sorry for the clickbait couldn't
resist there will be changes to the show
in the new year as our goal is to make
it more concise and juicy by focusing on
the most exciting new product releases
we're tightening up the structure of the
product reports will improve the flow
and we're very excited about the changes
