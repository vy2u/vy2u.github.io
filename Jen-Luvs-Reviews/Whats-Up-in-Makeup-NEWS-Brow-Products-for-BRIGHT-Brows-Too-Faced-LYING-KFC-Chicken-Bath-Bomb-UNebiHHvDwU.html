reviews and what so the makeup starts
now welcome to what's up and makeup for
November 12th 2017 let's get started
with the top industry news everybody has
a lip kit these days and the Victoria's
Secret Angels are no exception the
company has just launched lip kits based
on the choices of angels Ella hosk Sara
Sampaio jasmine tux and Martha hunt each
limited-edition kit has a lip liner
matching matte lipstick and glittery
gloss plus a giant picture of the
corresponding angel on the box each kit
of three products cost you only twenty
four fifty what's the best way to
protest against the beauty industry
create your own cosmetic line that's
what former charm star Rose McGowan and
her aunt Rory have done they have been
working on their cosmetic company the
only skincare for ten years in the hopes
that it would offer women who are tired
of skin damaging chemically rich
products and alternative the only
skincare potions are based on nature and
roses not told her about a mineral lake
that healed skin they recreated the
mineral list in their kitchens and
followed up with a lab refined complex
adding many natural ingredients so far
the line includes two products the only
wash foam cleanser cleansers $32 and the
only lotion moisturizers 48 dollars
pre-orders are being accepted and the
line will officially launch at the only
skincare calm in February a Mack and
Patrick star makeup collaboration is
coming for the holidays a full
collection is expected December 14th to
include a dozen delights starting with
this setting powder called Patrick's
powder lightweight and finely milled
with great coverage according to Mac $34
Kerry Washington actress and Neutrogena
creative consultant tease what the brand
has on tap for 2018 more hydraboost
beauty products being added to the
popular hydro boost water gel are the
hydro boost hydrating lip shine
extensions hydro boost mascara and the
nourishing brow pencil we'll have more
details soon Lime Crime will soon
release the companion to their diamond
crushers lip topper the triangular
looking tubular containers hold a liquid
eyeshadow that can be used alone or as a
topper and who's going to stop you if
you use it as I lighter not us the
product will come in ten shades from
teal blue to sparkling pink and promises
no fallout or smudging one shade will
cost you $20 and the entire collection
is $170 lip smacker Disney emoji we can
really just stop right there but let's
talk more about it these adorable balms
come in round character containers that
stand vertically you flip the base to
use them each one smells delicious and
has magical cuteness currently the line
includes Mickey Minnie Cinderella and
Belle each $5 and resembles the popular
some some line what's up there'll be
more to come available at Target and
soon at the lip smackers site anyone
who's ever dyed their hair a different
color than their natural hair has
probably asked what do I do about my
brows and these days what do I do with
my brows now that my hair is bright pink
now Kat Von D has the answer for you and
she's calling it quote the best
long-wear eyebrow product of all time
gotta have it yet don't answer yet
because she's also teasing three new
formulas brow struck eight reflective
powder signature brow a precision pencil
and super brow a pigmented pomade this
photo is of the paul maids in 16 shades
including electrics well you get one
when you think to face you probably have
unicorns in the back of your mind well
bring them right up front because the
brand is launching an entire themed
collection next february the life's a
festival collection is filled with
unicorns let's take a look the unicorn
tears iridescent mystical bronzer is $30
it's part bronzer and part highlighter
Viet life's a festival peace love and
unicorns i shadow palette is $42 has a
dozen shades in four finishes they're
also highlighting sticks and four
lipsticks and we will see the debut of
the magic crystal transforming lip gloss
$19 in unicorn tears angel tears fairy
tears and mermaid tears now are you
feeling it are you over it did you ever
want to hear the word unicorn again
or are you a mermaid at heart and here's
the big question should we hit the pause
button in all things mystical until next
year let us know what you think in the
comments below
and speaking of to face something a
little less magical it seems they may be
in hot water with the national
advertising division part of the Better
Business Bureau for some claims made
about the better than sex mascara nope
it's not the name they're not being
asked to prove that the mascara is
actually better than sex the claim in
question is that the mascara adds 1944%
more volume to the lashes as a report in
Women's Wear Daily
the agency which says there is not
enough reliable evidence wants to face
to eliminate the claim and the
before-and-after photos from the
packaging however in a statement to WWD
the company stated that quote to face
strongly stands behind the claims and
has appealed the NAD s decision in this
case the test used to establish these
claims were conducted using sound
methodology at a highly regarded
independent laboratory and the results
support not only the 1944% claim but
also the before and after photographs at
issue stay tuned and finally we have a
tradition here at what's up in makeup we
have a special showcase in our hearts
