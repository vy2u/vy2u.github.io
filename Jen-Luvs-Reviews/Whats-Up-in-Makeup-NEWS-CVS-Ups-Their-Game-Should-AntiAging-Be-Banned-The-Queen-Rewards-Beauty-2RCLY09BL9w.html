18 and 55 among its notable findings are
that the two most popular products to
buy online are makeup and skin care
products over 45% of respondents have
purchased a cosmetics item via a social
media post
57% of respondents would buy an item
from a third party seller if the product
was offered at a discount rate and 69%
of respondents were concerned about
