surface of your skin the service will
send you a skin test kit and pair your
results against their product database
skincare companies will be able to
partner with Epogen care to find out how
many customers will benefit from their
products based on the skin test they
hope that the relationships built with
skincare brands and customers will
encourage companies to be more
transparent about their product
ingredients you can pre-order your own
skincare perfecting kit on Epogen cares
website with tests starting at $199 next
time you want to find a new signature
scent you may find that it isn't a spray
more companies are releasing perfumes in
alternate formats which may last longer
and can be easier to pack in your bag
brands like pin rose Chanel glossier and
replicas are currently ahead of the game
with alternative formulas currently on
the market you can find balms oils
towelettes wax sticks and even perfume
cushions that can boast long wear time
and added skin benefits it appears that
a member of the drunk elephant skincare
instagram team had an unfortunate slip
of the hand a user named at Steph gray 3
4 3 3 commented on a glossier post
complaining about their new solution
containing fragrance then a user
unrelated to the incident replied about
how she didn't mind the smell the next
comment appears to be from at drunk
elephant skincare but is in direct reply
to the second user where the reply
should have been from at Steph grey 343
for the team at drunk elephant skincare
deny allegations that the account at
Steph grey 3 4 3 4 was created for the
sole purpose of starting drama but the
user account has since disappeared from

lawmakers are attempting to fight
against animal testing with legislation
introduced by Senator Kathleen Galgiani
of Stockton called the California
cruelty free cosmetics act backed by a
social compassion and legislation the
Physicians Committee for Responsible
medicine cruelty-free International and
lush cosmetics this legislation would
ban the sale of any animal tested
Cosmetics throughout the state of
California galgianni hopes to continue
setting an example to the country as a
whole
California has long been a leader in
promoting modern alternatives to animal
tests as Galgiani in action at the
federal level compels California to lead
the way if passed the bill would make it
illegal for any cosmetic manufacturer to
knowingly import or sell any cosmetic
including personal hygiene products such
as deodorant shampoo or conditioner in
California if the final product or any
component of the product was tested on
animals we've been hearing rumors and
buzz about deci on parent company of the

longer with the company is another
co-ceo and Nicola Kilner who told
wracked in a text message sadly yes I'm
too heartbroken to talk about it at the
moment possible former CFO Steven Kaplan
whose status is still unconfirmed by the
company is also currently unreachable
for comments the news arrived amid a
flurry of odd posts made by the brand as
a result of Truex's personal takeover of
all debts iam social social media
accounts when the cut reached out to
Truex regarding his choices on social
media he stated quote I'm in a happy
place and I'm ignoring anyone who is
unhappy about it loving people will see
me and SEM for who we are unhappy ones
