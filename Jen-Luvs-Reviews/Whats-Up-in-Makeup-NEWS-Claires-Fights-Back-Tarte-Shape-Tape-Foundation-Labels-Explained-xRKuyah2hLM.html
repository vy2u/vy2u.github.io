always cut and dried and tart is sending
us on a ride I'm Jen from Jen loves
reviews and what CIPA makeup starts now
welcome to whatsapp and makeup for
January 7th 2018 let's get started with
the top industry news 2017 was packed
full of new things for beauty especially
in the trend category trend whether it
was brows lips gadgets or applicators
some were interesting and some were just
plain odd so let's run straight into
2018 by running away from some of these
trends let's start with some of the most
seen trends the oddball items used for
applying foundation most of us heard of
the silly sponge when it came out but
what its spawn was just plain weirdness
there was the Beauty Blender encased in
a condom the boiled egg and the chicken
cutlet silicone bra insert also referred
to as the boobie blender offered upgrade
entertainment but almost zero offered
quality results and who could forget
brows feather brows caught on for a
short time the squiggle brow had
trendies practicing their drawing skills
for those without skills the brows stamp
was sure to please and let's not forget
the braided brow on second thought let's
do forget the braided brow especially
since most of the time it was just
someone photoshopping a braid onto their
face on a more serious and more awesome
side there was also the brow wig for
those lacking in that area also a
favorite freckles painted on decal dawn
or star shaped they all had their spot
in the Hall of infamy and lastly
although not a beauty trend the last one
was a concept beauty trend the idea of
shinning was it had to help everyone
stop worrying about looking so perfect
on Instagram and now the 2018 is in full
swing we can only wonder how many more
interesting or even downright bizarre
trends might come our way when they pop
up and you know they will we'll be here
to cover them get ready to shout shut up
and take my money Kim Kardashian has
announced her plans for a lipstick
collection her latest post says it all
quote the k'kaw beauty product I'm most
excited about for 2018 lipsticks no word
on the exact price or launch date
rest assured they'll be plenty of height
before the launch more information as it
becomes available as you may know Sonia
Kashuk stepped down from her role as
creative director for her line at Target
her last official collection with the
company was in spring of 2017
since then the brand has seemed to
continue to sell as usual until now word
is spreading among Target employees who
handle inventory that the line will be
discontinuing their cosmetics and
concentrating solely on bags and brushes
we have no confirmation yet from Target
but if you happen to be a fan of the
cosmetics you might want to start
watching the shelves and stock up if you
need to buy now almost every makeup fan
has heard of tart shaped tape most seem
to love it so imagine if tart came out
with a shape tape foundation based on
the brand social media it seems the
clues are pointing in that direction
there has been no official announcement
but here is what we have to go on for
now and Instagram video by the company
shows what appears to be longer and
broader applicators with the same shape
tape Chevron on it a tweet from
kathleenlights
asked at Tarte cosmetics can we get a
shape tape foundation lol and tart
replied quote we're thinking the same
thing winky face one might also find it
interesting there is in fact a shape
tape family section that pops up in the
search on tarts website we'll just have
to wait and see what Tarte has in store
fancy took the makeup world by storm
when they launched a product that
catered to over 40 skin tones with
highlighters and lip glosses right
beside them many have been wondering
what would be next for the brand and now
we know - over the brand's top-selling
products are now available in a mini duo
called the bomb baby mini lip and face
set Odin loved minis the second Cannes
one kilowatt highlighter in hostile baby
and the universally flattering gloss
balm please excuse that terrible
rendition of that song Fendi merely
describes this set as a must-have set in
travel friendly sizes for killer
radiance on the fly the set is now
available on the Fanta Beauty site and
at Sephora for $23 we've all been there
we walk into a store and feel as though
we are in the middle of some type of
vocabulary test one label says natural
one says not tested on animals the other
one claims to be hypoallergenic
when all these terms actually mean we're
gonna break it down for you right now so
hypoallergenic simply means less likely
to cause an allergic reaction this is a
guideline not a guarantee no company can
actually truly create a hypoallergenic
product natural simply stated it refers
to products that are made with
ingredients that are not created in a
lab however a company need only prove
that five percent of its ingredients are
natural to print this claim so I know if
it lasts longer than three weeks once
open the odds are it is not 100% natural
next up we have organic the FDA hands
off the quote USDA Organic seals based
on three options first option is 100%
that other than salt and water the
ingredients or organically produced
second is organic which is 95 percent
third is made with organic ingredients
which is 70 percent approved ingredients
alcohol-free once again there are three
categories with alcohol-free products
the categories are fatty simple and
aromatic
next up essential oils when seeing this
on a label it tells a consumer that it
contains an ingredient that has the
essence of a plant one needs to consider
what carrier oil was used with the
essentials the heavier the carrier oil
the less likely the essential oil will
penetrate the skin
next up active ingredients any
ingredient that has a biological effect
on the skin they're often found labeled
on packages as percentage such as
retinols a Ajay's be a cheese and
vitamin C with any of this news to you
let us know in the comments below
surely before Christmas we told you
about a mother that sent her child's
makeup purchased at Claire's to a
laboratory for testing where it was
found to contain asbestos it was then
that the company decided to pull all
item we're suspecting to contain the
harmful ingredient from their sales
floors we now some updates on the story
on December 27th Claire's issued the
following statement concerning this
matter we have retained an independent
laboratory to test the cited products in
order to determine whether the recent
news reports are accurate in the interim
we have stopped the sales of the
products and are issuing full refunds to
concerned customers as always the safety
of our customers and products is our top
priority
well two days later on December 29th the
company event issued 8:30
it's saying the initial result of
testing by an independent certified
laboratory show that the cosmetics
tested to date are asbestos free out of
an abundance of caution additional
testing is underway we also have
confirmation that the talcum ingredient
supply is from a certified asbestos free
European vendor we will continue to
honor returns to any customers remaining
uncomfortable we have a feeling this
isn't over yet and we'll update you as
details develop 3d printing is finding
its way into almost every area of our
lives even our makeup in 2016 Smashbox
experimented with 3d printed lipsticks
in celebration of the launch of their be
legendary lipsticks now researchers from
the UK's cosmetic science group at
London College of Fashion
recently published a paper describing
the use of 3d printing to produce
personalized lipstick after obtaining a
scan off the person's lips and a few
tweaks the result is a lipstick base
mold and cap where the inner part of the
mold perfectly matches the lip contours
of the person it is then manufactured
using a 3d printer the end product
lipstick that they say can be perfectly
applied with no mirrors necessary the
idea is that the user would be able to
simply press the lipstick against the
lips for perfect application well our
questions would be what happens is the
lipstick wears down what kind of
applicator is going to hold the product
and how will it work and will my hands
get disgustingly messy from it and the
ever-important we're just pressing the
lipsticks onto the lips look just as
good as swiping the product over the
lips like a traditional lipstick and if
this catches on what we finally get our
flying cars there's a new Kickstarter in
town and it combines a magnetic makeup
palette smart design and obsessive
organizational abilities the palette by
salt New York was developed by Caitlin
Galloway aka Kiki G on YouTube a makeup
artist and upcoming youtuber who saw a
problem and developed a solution the
palette lets you snuggle your pan only
makeup securely in a housing that is eco
friendly made with post-consumer
recycled materials and vegan leather and
built to last
shadows face products and even pencils
and brushes can all be kept in a
separate clutch even better there's no
to worry about your makeup clanging
together breaking and coating the
interior if your bag and a cloud of
particles and purchasing pan only refill
makeup from your favorite brands help to
fight the problem of cosmetic packaging
waste upwards of 25 million tons of
waste annually being a Kickstarter of
course there are perks there are levels
where you can receive pallets or at a
higher level you can get a one-hour
session with Kiki herself via Skype or
in person to answer questions review
your products with you and help you to
determine exactly what it is you need if
you happen to live in New York
you're a one-on-one will also include
dinner this project will only happen if
enough funds are raised by January 14th
of this year so if you think it's as
smart as we do show your support soon
I'm walking into a MAC store you can
find pretty much anything you need from
concealers to lipstick but one thing
that's been missing has been nudie
sponges namely Beauty blenders just like
Mac this tiny sponge has been a cult
classic and now it will start carrying a
selection of the raved about sponges
this week online and in stores at Mac
for the same amount everyone's used to
Beauty Blender originals will be $20 as
well to the Beauty Blender pro the micro
minis will be $18 and while we're
talking Mac they first approached Jeremy
Scott two years ago to collaborate on a
limited-edition line and the day to see
this collection has arrived he has given
us a boom box shaped eyeshadow palette
with 29 shades a lip palette shaped like
a cassette tape and chic products in the
shape of a CD for our younger viewers
this is how we used to play music just
in case the Mac Jeremy Scott collection
will be available starting January 8th
at select Mac locations all right you
got a 9:00 a.m. meaning an 11:30
conference call and your brows are a
mess who are you gonna call if you're in
California you could get on the phone
with sly brow the on-demand Mobil Brown
service launched in 2015 by Suzy mold on
the on demand brow service has already
built a following with clients like Hulu
Linkedin Salesforce Neutrogena Twitter
and Conde Nast and now fly brow is
looking to expand across the United
States
they say if you'll want someone with an
obsession with a passion for
eyebrows you are going to go to the
right person and that person is from fly
brow Moldavian says if that person is
coming to your office and making your
life easier it's a no-brainer it's not
productive for women to sit in the salon
during work hours I meet them at their
work and take an errand off of their
list services include brow shaping for
$40 tinting for $25 lip waxing for 10
and typically has clients back in their
offices within 15 minutes
hoping to franchise fly brow would be a
good company with other on-call beauty
services like glam squads they'll be
Prive be glammed and beauty linked
