two-faced art and colleague will be
sooner is unexpected
I'm Jen from Jen Lowe's reviews and
what's been makeup starts now welcome to
what's with the makeup for August 13
2017 let's get started with the top
industry news earlier this week
colour-pop announced that they will be
selling at Sephora their first
brick-and-mortar store co-founder and
president of the brand parent company
Laura Nelson stated the one thing you
can always count on from colour-pop is
change we want to evolve the model of
how brands and retailers work together
we are proud to partner with the fora
who shared our vision for revolution not
evolution we are redefining what luxury
means in beauty is no longer defined by
price points the news left many happy
and a few puzzled wondering why Sephora
and not Ulta many founds a ray of hope a
day or so after when a tweet made the
realm with a simple answer from an Ulta
rep quote details will be available soon
be sure to keep an eye out and then the
other shoe dropped color Bob responded
to bustle stating color pop has no
current plans to be in Ulta and is
thrilled to enter Sephora in November of
2017 Ulta reps
also reached out to refinery29 and
stated it was all a big misunderstanding
as well while also does love color top
and thinks it is a great brand there are
no immediate plans to add the brand to
their lineup also is currently looking
into who sent out the incorrect
information but we were all happy there
for a minute
by now you've probably seen the upcoming
two-phase peaches and cream collection
you may be happy and excited but there
is one company that is not so happy cha
cha filed suit on August 7th against
two-phase claiming quote unfair
competition the legal filings follow a
letter sent to toothpaste on July 6th of
this year in which two-phase was said to
quote use and/or imitate touches
inherently distinctive trade dress
product in question is tacho chotto silk
lipstick which two faiths allegedly
infringed upon with their peach kissed
moisture mat long wear lipstick in the
legal complaint it said that quote
outside counsel for two-face has stated
defendants intention to move forward
with the launch of a V infringing
products Tata is hoping the complaint
will stop that also in the complaint
Tata presents that with the widespread
social media coverage of to face new
products confusion within the
marketplace is already happening
one customer stated on Instagram why
does a lipstick look like they ripped
off the packaging from Tata s MH not
cool alongside the previously stated
claims talked to laid out numerous
factors in the suit that shows
similarities noting that these key
features have been a part of their
product since 2015
among them a solid colored cap with the
company's name etched into the side a
golden tube with bright gold circular
medallion displaying the brand's logo at
the base of the case at the closure
point and a semicircular cutout in the
cap that ensures the trademark is
centered above the logo when the
container is closed after seeing this
photos do you see a case for ChaCha let
us know in the comments when you were in
school how did you take a break from
cramming for exams for one college
student downtime meant formulating a
distinct set of cosmetics the student
Nirvana sefie is from Pakistan her
friend from a wide range of
nationalities such as Indian Lebanese
and Sarah Lankan were constantly on the
hunt for a shade that complemented their
skin tone
Sethi said makeup is part of her DNA she
was raised in a home full of independent
strong women who loved their beauty
products as a kid she would often sneak
off to play with her grandmother's
extensive collection she was not allowed
to wear makeup as a teen but all that
has changed it has been 10 years since
the launch of her dubai-based brand
luscious cosmetics the brand has a wide
range of products affordably priced from
$9 to $30 and American fans can now
rejoice it is now available in the US on
their website how can you not love a
and that has a sentence tone policy that
any new mascara must be tested approved
by Amir Bono's on before release when
Kylie Jenner launched her cosmetics line
in November of 2015 at the age of 19 and
immediately sold out of her first three
lip kits financial experts expected the
brand to end up a top player in the
beauty game numbers ranging from $50 so
three hundred million dollars were
thrown out bear but it seems they missed
this target by a huge amount in just 18
months Kylie cosmetics has raked in a
whopping 420 million dollars history has
shown that most companies take a
prolonged period of time to hit the
billion dollar mark Tom Ford took a
decade which is one of the Estee Lauder
companies fastest growing alongside Joe
Malone
Bobby rounds of 25 years and
surprisingly Lancome took 80 years at
the current rate of growth projected for
Kylie cosmetics she should be in the
billion dollar club around 2022 her
seventh year in business which lands her
right in the midst of some of the
largest Beauty companies in the market
not a bad place to be setting as she
will be only 26 years old
fifty shades of beige the phrase often
used to describe a lack of POC friendly
foundations one company a PDG is taking
social media by storm receiving
outstanding praises for their truly wide
range of shades the brand's long wear
liquid pigment can be used as a
foundation concealer or mix of your
favorite moisturizer for a custom-made
DIY BB cream it's offering 33 shades
ranging from porcelain white to almost
onyx black including 16 darker shades
with varying undertones and their
cruelty free so everyone can find their
correct shade the brand is offering
sample packs each containing eight
shades and four color options
light/medium medium dark and dark for
ten dollars each the bun even had jackie
ina tweeting that she has never had such
a demand for information on any other
product as she has with a PDG and that
she herself missed out on the sample
packs but good news they have recently
been restocked maybe odds be ever in
your favor
check the shades at a PDG
oh and finally let's take a trip five
years into the future or future
suicide when your local beauty retailer
has counter is specifically catering to
men this may Sharma L'Oreal UK director
spoke about taboos being broken fitting
that many brands may have counters
targeting men within five to seven years
today you have very small proportion of
men who want to use makeup products but
that population is growing and it will
continue to grow he stated the taboos
are going so between my generation and
my son's generation the taboos are very
different many companies have started
hiring males to represent their brands
but does this actually help
Georgie Aldous a male beauty blogger
thinks it does not and says in my
opinion it creates a bigger gender
divide when we are trying to get rid of
it instead of creating more of a divide
brands should focus on marketing better
towards men so they don't need separate
stands makeup artist and stylist Louis
Duncan Whedon stated I think male
oriented makeup counters would be a
fantastic thing but does concede that
not every chap would feel comfortable
with that it's about time the general
public saw that guys wearing makeup
isn't a big deal do you think male
beauty counters would be a good thing
