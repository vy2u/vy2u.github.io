new faces on deck and Alexa gets you
ready high-tech I'm Jen from Jenn Mo's
reviews and what to the makeup starts
now welcome to what have been makeup for
January 28th 2018 let's get started with
the top industry news L'Oreal and Revlon
are working on diversity based campaigns
but some aspects may seem politically
charged Palestinian born blogger and
activist Imani alcazaba owns Muslim girl
calm and recently declined the Revlon
changemaker award in opposition of the
brand's new ambassador gal gadot Imani
stated on Instagram that godot's support
of the Israeli defensive forces actions
in Palestine goes against a Muslim girl
coms morals and values she went on to
say I think we are in a moment where we
must persist that women's empowerment
includes all women from the bottom of my
heart I feel I would not embody the
meaning of the changemaker award if I
were to accept in these circumstances
similarly Amina Khan the Palestinian
beauty blogger who was named L'Oreal's
first hijab wearing hair model retracted
her participation in the new campaign
after anti-israeli tweet she wrote in
2014 were uncovered Amina took to
Instagram to explain championing
diversity is one of my passions I don't
discriminate against anyone I've chosen
to delete the tweets as they do not
represent the message of harmony that I
stand for she explained that she was
backing out because the conversations
surrounding her messages were detracting
from the sentiments of the brand's
campaign when you're pregnant one of the
first things you may do is become an
expert in product labels but fear not
expecting moms the maternity clothing
brand hatch has developed skin care that
they say is safe for you and your baby
the new line is called mama and it is
here to help overcome the challenges
unique to pregnancy that many of us
struggle with stocked with beauty
necessities and pampering products
packed with non-toxic ingredients the
line includes stretch mark reducing oil
belly sheet masks rescue bombs and hair
oil all can be found on the Company's
website for between twelve dollars and
sixty
dollars how much money is on your lips
right now a kind redditor recently
calculated just how much we're paying
for lipstick by the ounce if you're the
type of person who wants the best bang
for your buck you may be surprised to
find out some dupes aren't giving you
the best deal when Wilde ranks the best
value at seven dollars and sixty-two
cents per ounce but color pops shocking
157 dollars per ounce ranks just above
Kat Von D at about one hundred fifty
eight dollars per ounce
hooda beauty is more affordable than you
might think at about fifty nine dollars
per ounce and the most expensive on the
list probably not a shocker Tom Ford at
a whopping five hundred forty dollars
per ounce so let's repeat the question
how much money is on your lips right now
last week we shared tweets and Facebook
posts from Ulta employees claiming that
locations resale used returned makeup oh
tha's official response was to say quote
we do not allow the resale of used or
damaged products now comes word that
derm store may be selling expired drunk
elephant products as you might know
drunk elephant uses ingredients such as
vitamin C and skincare products and
therefore it does have a specific
expiration date
even for unopened products it has taken
a while for us to trace back the
situation that started it all but from
what we could find apparently an
influencer by the handle Beauty deals
BFF posted a deal on her Instagram which
included a derm store sale and discount
code which could be used on drunk
elephant items drunk elephant commented
on her post later that derm store is no
longer an authorized reseller of their
products this seemed to be a sale on old
stock that should have been returned to
drunk elephant a similar exchange
between drunk elephant and a redditor
using the handle at Leaney one two three
seems to confirm this was old stock
later leaning one two three added a
response from derm store stating quote
all drunk elephant inventory at Durham
story is not expired and has been
approved by the drunk elephant team
multiple times we have been an
authorized professional skin care
retailer for eighteen years and only
ordered directly from our brands always
as drunk elephant strategy continues to
evolve they have made the decision to
focus their
sources on their own online business and
have hence postponed their partnership
with germ store and other online
retailers our agreement with drunk
elephant is that we will continue to
sell their products until February 1st
this is where the story should come to
an end but we've been reading comments
from you in the comments underneath the
makeup minute earlier this week and
other places on the internet about your
experiences with expired products from
derm store and derm store customer care
not meeting your needs so we have a
feeling this one may not be over yet
we'll keep you posted the intentions of
the latest gel online of italian nail
polish brand y khan was lost in
translation the line was reportedly
inspired by a collection of hip-hop song
titles such as bottles in the club and
million dollar kitty cat but not the
word kitty cat but they went too far
when naming their black shade thick as a
n-word the brand defended their faux pas
by re-explaining their inspiration but
has since apologized and is said to have
taken all names off of the entire line
and replaced them with numbers however
we checked their website for the shade
and it may have been renamed to black
