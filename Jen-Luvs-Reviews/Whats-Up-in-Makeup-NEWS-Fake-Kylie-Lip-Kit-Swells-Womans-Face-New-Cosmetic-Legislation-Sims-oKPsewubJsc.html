recalls make the scene look grim and is
the next top model' Oh
sim hum Chen from Gemma's reviews and
what - the makeup starts now welcome to
what's up and make up for February 18th
2018 let's get started with the top
industry news in a world full of bespoke
makeup convenience and beauty regimens
on demand service websites and apps are
struggling to grab hold
after a boom in 2015 of the apps which
bring hair stylists and makeup artists
to your doorstep it's becoming more
evident that consumers are looking for
an experienced over convenience then set
an app offering at-home blowouts for a
whopping 100 dollars is now focusing
their efforts on partnering with
corporations and events instead some
apps of closer doors completely proving
that sometimes the way we've always done
it really may be the best way to
continue so I'm 64 and Soho London is
asking that you reimagine what you see
in your salon experience first imagine
that it doesn't actually seem to be a
salon part members club part coffee shop
part dressing room salon 64 aims to
personalize your next appointment from
start to finish they aim to bring back
the day's we're sitting in a salon was
the start of your evening founder Ricky
Walter specifically chose a designer who
had no experience with salons noting in
an interview with Forbes quote the space
had to be remodeled away from any salon
stereotypes or preconceived views
Walter sums up the experience by
claiming no other salon in London or the
world has created a social hub where
patrons can meet greet work and enjoy a
host of hair and beauty treatments the
ultimate morning getting ready spot or
post work retreat am i real or are you
imagining me is this the singularity
there has been an interesting influx of
models on social media who are in
reality very carefully crafted digital
images of people who do not exist such
models have recently been seen wearing
fancy Beauty and representing patent
Grethe entire Instagram accounts of the
models are dedicated to representing
whatever the creating artist chooses at
shoo-doo Graham who is described as the
first digital supermodel is created by
photographer Cameron James Wilson using
a 3d modeling program similarly pun
intended
lil Mikaela whose origins are unknown
can be seen modeling street fashion has
a Spotify account and will be the next
Pat McGrath Muse do you think CGI models
are the new reality or are they really
just a dream
can you tell their simulations tell us
and you know we're Canadian based hair
care brand Marc Anthony has acquired
indie company cake beauty Heather rear
founder of cake Beauty stated quote a
building cake from the little company
started in a kitchen to the beloved
brand it is today has been the ride of a
lifetime and the natural next step for
cake is international expansion the
acquisition will support cake beauty by
providing global marketing and
operations expertise while allowing Marc
Anthony to expand into the color
cosmetics sector and along those lines
indie beauty brands led by self-made
females are becoming increasingly
prominent online and recognized by the
media brands like core organics owned by
model Miranda Kerr and the lip bar owned
by businesswoman Melissa Butler as well
as spectrum collections owned by
creative sister Sophia and Hannah
Pycroft have a few things in common that
propel their success their products all
have the visible personal touch of their
owners who are involved in most of the
design and formula decisions they also
make environmentally conscious business
savvy decisions that are met with
success in sales to top it all off the
brand's all got their start with little
to no outside help
proving that passion prevails with
today's customers you may have noticed
that the beauty section at your local
target is starting to look a little bit
more like your local department store
the company started a pilot revamp in
October with 70 stores the open floor
layout concierge driven beauty section
design allows customers to discover new
products complete with a trial sized
trainee collection
we'll roll out up to 330 more
renovations this year helping you find
the luxury and drugstore makeup and
skincare Kylie Jenner has taken to
personally confirming a fans counterfeit
suspicions on her Twitter page the user
asked if a site where she found supposed
Kylie cosmetics products was legitimate
the star replied fake Kylie cosmetics
com only with a link to her site so
buyer beware only the brand site is
authorized to sell Kylie cosmetics
products
unfortunately the warning did not come
soon enough for a young woman in Ireland
named Rachel McLaughlin who purchased a
mat Kylie liquid lipstick from a
facebook vendor who claimed it was
genuine the price alone it was around $4
should have been a tip-off
Rachel wore the lippy out on a Friday
night but soon started feeling strange
the next morning the lower half of her
face was swollen and she struggled to
breathe
I lost all feeling around the bottom of
my face and my lips continued to grow
bigger from when I first saw them a
glock Len told Belfast live from which
the original images come her family took
her to the ER and her lips continued to
swell she received treatment and is
currently on the mend her lips are
completely gooey and blistering her
older sister Branagh
explained she added that their aunt a
nurse said that if Rachael hadn't been
young and with a strong immune system it
could have been much worse a
spokesperson for the Belfast Trust said
whilst we cannot comment on individual
cases we urge everyone to be vigilant in
using fake lip kits as some of the
contents may lead to a reaction of
varying severity on a related note if
you're still holding on to your benefit
gimme brow after its recalled like I
have been you may want to finally say
goodbye a report released by the FDA and
found by a member of our whatsapp and
makeup team revealed that samples of the
product contained an antibiotic
resistant bacteria repeat antibiotic
resistant if you have any concerns
related to the product you can call or
email benefit using the information
listed here and because of several
recalls on makeup products containing
harmful substances a push for tighter
regulations on production and
ingredients is in the works
currently decisions concerning product
safety are overseen on a company of
specific basis however watch for these
on the horizon first the personal care
product Safety Act which states that the
FDA will require tests on ingredients
for safety and established limits for
use then the children's product warning
label Act which will require that
products containing talc are labeled
with an appropriate warning unless the
product is proven to be asbestos free
the Safe Cosmetics Modernization Act
which requires companies to document
ingredients and report adverse events
and the cosmetics safety and
Modernization Act which will update the
safety standards for cosmetic companies
if passed into law these regulations
could make a huge impact on product
development and brand transparency on
positive note in light of CBS's campaign
to go Photoshop free the company hosted
the face of beauty panel at New York
Fashion Week the panel consisted of
MSNBC journalist joy and read beauty
blogger at Norton gory CBS chief
marketing officer Norman de Greve a
Revlon model Ashley Graham and honest
beauty spokesman Daniel Martin the group
aimed to bring attention to the benefits
of honest advertising and beauty
realities by citing women's health and
marketing statistics you can view the
entire panel video on made to measures
or m2m s Facebook page did you know that
musician house E is a makeup artist the
team at YSL Beauty recognized the
performer skills and has offered her
unique type of partnership how they will
create unique makeup looks to share on
social media via her personal and
brand's accounts the brand hopes to
appeal to the Millennial consumer by
showcasing the partnership traditional
drugstore makeup brands such as Revlon
covergirl and Maybelline are facing
pressure to undergo makeovers in their
branding and marketing the Beauty Giants
have been seeing slowing sales as
direct-to-consumer and boutique beauty
stores are becoming more popular one
could argue that the struggles are a
result of poor social media profit
presence or shoppers being exposed to a
larger variety of novel products in an
effort to put a fresh face forward the
brands are revamping store displays

expanding product selections do you
