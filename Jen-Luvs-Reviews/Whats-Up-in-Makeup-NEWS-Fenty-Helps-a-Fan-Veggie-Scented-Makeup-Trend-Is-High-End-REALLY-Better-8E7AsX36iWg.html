difference between drugstore and
high-end is actually valid and next year
your makeup might smell like a salad I'm
Jen from Jen Lowe's reviews and when to
the make out starts now welcome to
what's up and make up for April 8th 2018
let's get started with the top industry
news model Larissa Cross and makeup
artist Christopher Michael have paired
up to bring us the model diversity
project the first of many projects is a
photo shoot featuring 5 models of
varying age race and body type cross set
in an interview with Mike we wanted to
show the beauty where it's not just one
model by themselves but all of us
together this is personal this is the
world that I see I see light black Asian
latina I see older models younger models
the duo encourages everyone to take part
in the movement and share the images on
their social media with the hashtag the
model diversity project Philadelphia
natives Camille Bell and Johnny
Velazquez started pound cake with a
dream for everyone to find their perfect
red lipstick the hot cakes collection
contains 5 matte red lipstick shades
that complement your skin and natural
lip tones with a guide on line of which
color to choose the company's mission
States never again will you have to buy
lipstick that looks different on you
then as advertised or as expected the
startup met their IndieGoGo campaign
goal and hope to release the line in May
of this year Dallas based makeup artist
Sandra Saenz is working to make her mark
behind the runway scenes as a Mexican
born Muslim woman her goal is to be the
first hijab wearing makeup artist to be
represented by an agency that supports a
runway shows during an interview with
Dean magazine Sandra explained that
while she hasn't encountered negativity
in her personal life she has in the
workplace I do makeup with my hands not
my head job she said you can check out
her work on Instagram
at the saundra sounds major rihanna fan
Chiara aka at only for the Rhian Twitter
face tragedy when her belongings
including her prized Fendi beauty
collection were stolen from her hotel
room
she took her frustrations to Twitter
where the brand noticed her sad news
they replied that they were willing to
replace her items proving that the Fendi
family is endlessly supportive of their
fans and racking up endless goodwill
points if you follow sephora's new
arrivals and bestsellers page long
enough you may notice that the company
has helped some small brands grow
Lawless we and others have received
extra love on Sephora's website and
social media platforms and are prominent
in the AR tools in the sephora app
representatives from the brand's
admitted to the blog glossy that their
participation in Sephora sample program
has also attributed to growth while none
would disclose if these tactics came at
an extra cost so force a support and
stamp of approval can certainly turn
small brands into household names if
you've ever wondered what really sets
drugstore products apart from high-end
you may conclude that the differences
are clear as mud paths advancements are
made with ingredients formulas and shade
ranges the correlation between price and
quality appears to be diminishing the
differences between a mystique and
prestige manifests in variables such as
ingredient quality and source
development technology and shade
availability the concentrations of
quality ingredients will also impact the
price point premium brands may also be
able to address your specific needs more
readily than brands you find at the
drugstore
however drugstore brands can help you
achieve the trendy looks you love for
less regardless of the market it's
always important for you to consider
what works best for your skin and your
personal price point Clarins will open
five concept stores in Asia this year
modeled after their Hong Kong location
the signature red and white branding
will be paired with light wood and
welcoming lighting and the layout will
encourage testing and experiencing the
products the shops will house a travel
friendly section as well as an in-store
spa geared to helping each customer make
the best choices for their individual
skin the stores will also feature the
brand's most popular products
prominently
filler in dbrand obsessive-compulsive
Cosmetics has disappeared from social
media and their website is down to a
simple statement while rumor has it that
the company has closed completely their
website suggests the absence is not
permanent those without standing orders
are encouraged to email info at OCC
makeup calm no definitive statement has
come from the company itself so we will
continue to monitor their website and
social media channels for updates we may
be able to get gwen stefani signature
bright red lip color with her stamp of
approval the no doubt front woman and
solo artist filed to trademark
variations on the name paint which will
service cosmetics nail products and
retail services we can't wait to see
what Gwen comes up with hopefully there
will be skin care as well because that
chick does not age in a campaign with a
surfrider foundation ran skincare hopes
to go waste free by 2021 in the clean to
skin clean to planet initiative Ren will
assist the Surfrider Foundation and
cleaning up over 300 beaches extending
their passion beyond their skincare
realm the company promises to reduce all
necessary product packaging use recycled
plastic and offer reusable and
refillable options for their products
you've enjoyed products fragrance like
peaches and chocolate but have you ever
wished your skin care but smell like
carrots or tomatoes or cucumbers or
peppers according to one company
vegetable scents are the next big trend
for beauty products bell flavours and
fragrances is a leading supplier of
flavors fragrances botanical extracts
and ingredient specialties to many
industries including personal care Bell
is predicting that crisp vegetables will
be the next cosmetic trend in the coming
year since green alternatives are the
top choice for eco-friendly and
health-conscious consumers
according to Bell vegetables are not
only needed in a balanced diet but due
to their rich ingredients the
nutritionally rich plants are also
associated with many positive effects
for the skin and hair we encourage
brands to go for extraordinary product
concepts explains marketing specialists
on Joe Racing vegetable fragrances are a
good example of how the extraordinary
can be used to address the consumers
desire for a healthier way of life a
combination of vegetables spices and
herbs can be combined to create fine
fragrance notes that evoke the feeling
of warmth and comfort think pumpkin and
pink pepper tomato and sage or sweet
corn and basil what are your thoughts
would you want to smell like a delicious
salad after a shower or would you rather
stick to the more traditional scent
share your thoughts in the comments
below now for putting their own twist on
familiar products milk makeup has once
again turned the ordinary into the
extraordinary the cutting-edge brand has
just expanded its skincare line with its
first solid serum the watermelon
illuminating serum the product is
similar to milks existing solid products
housed in a transparent cylindrical tube
but the contents are totally new both
for the brand and for the beauty
industry in general quote every serum we
saw in the market was in a dropper glass
bottle they were really frilly and not
easy or portable Diana Ruth product
developer and head of operations for
milk shared the product is not wasted in
your hands it is very modern and very
utilitarian the serum contains hydrating
water melon extract Swiss a garden cress
sprout and vitamins A C and E which will
brighten the skin according to them
while protecting it from free radicals
