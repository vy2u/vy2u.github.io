taking on some new forms and hurricane
inspired makeup I'm Jen from Jen loves
reviews and what's up and makeup starts
now welcome to what's been makeup for
September 17 2017 let's get started with
the top industry news covergirl has been
a household name in the cosmetic
industry for decades often choosing an
amazing person as the face of the brand
people like Queen Latifah Rihanna Ellen
DeGeneres and the ageless christie
brinkley have enhanced the value of the
brand now the company has named their
latest covergirl ISA ray well known for
her web series awkward black girl and
her role in the HBO series insecure the
official announcement was made through
ESA's Instagram page where she stated
quote I remember casually flipping
through covergirl ads singing their
slogan in my head never ever in my life
did I imagine I would be one ASA stands
out as the only face of covergirl that
has written and starred in her own TV
show she said in an official statement
quote my character is ever-evolving and
makeup is a tool to help transform my
persona whether for a role I play in
content that I produce or the different
roles I take on in life she went on to
add becoming a covergirl means a lot
because the brand recognizes just how
important it is for people to embrace
their individuality and express
themselves in unique and diverse ways
this has been a major part of my
personal journey and a message that I
want to share with others Congrats
ISA on this latest achievement and if
you see covergirl displays in store you
may also see one of the collective
influencer network with products to
recreate their looks look for the
Instagram logo on those displays
creating makeup looks that no one else
has done is getting harder and harder to
do it seems people have thought of
everything but turns out there's always
a new spin on makeup to be had on
September 9th Instagrammer Callie Harlow
steps out of the box and into the storm
with this hurricane inspired I look as
part of the text accompanying the post
Callie wrote
my heart breaks for the Caribbeans the
Bahamas and now Florida and eventually
Georgia everyone please be safe and be
careful however not everyone saw the
look the way Kelly did and comments soon
erupted into their own storm one
commenter wrote very cool timing people
are dying and you are taking advantage
of the situation to get likes not cool
callie eventually apologized to quote
everyone who i have offended with my
latest makeup post so what do you think
was this just art or was it
disrespectful to the people who endured
and are still enduring the effects of
this tragic event we'd love to know your
thoughts in the comments below
