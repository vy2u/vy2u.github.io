lesson in makeup for July 30th 2017
let's take a look at the top industry
news of the week when I'll stop there
Beverly Hills noir vina maybe
announcement about a sister palette to
the modern renaissance and then a photo
was released anticipation was high this
week the wait was over as the subculture
palette made its debut people flocked to
the site to order and in what seems to
be standard four new releases these days
the palette quickly sold out however
earlier this week noir veena responded
to a fan tweet by stating that the
palette was permanent
back in February Mac intrigued us with a
photo of a palette called basic bitch
and buzz ensued this past week Mac
announced the launch of the hashtag
matte girls collection six pallets that
include eight matte and shimmer shadows
alongside an illuminating highlighter
here's a quick overview of the basic
bitch and her friends rockin rebel for
those wanting more color this one's for
you
mischief minks creates a perfect sunset
eye with a few sultry add-ins fashion
fanatic covers pretty much every shadow
trend of this year thus far pretty
princess pretty and flattering neutrals
power-hungry shows your dominance with a
gold leaf eye and basic bitch the basics
meet sultry amped up neutrals and a
Dasha staff available online now and in
Mac stores August 3rd 3950 each Amazon
has just announced a partnership with
wheat glow to create the first Amazon
exclusive beauty product the rich
collagen face mask is the only product
available right now but more are in the
works for now think about a map that can
gently exfoliate plump your skin and
offers grapefruit an apricot as well as
soothing cucumber the mask is gentle
enough to use daily and it's suggested
for three times a week for max effects
importantly it does not test on animals
the mask is available on Amazon and a
pack of 12 for $39 or on the we closed
site where you can join their masks
subscription despite more and more men
admitting that they take care of their
skin it's still not a common thing for
them to use face masks mostly thinking
masking is it's girly thing to do this
is why om4 skincare line for men has
designed shaving masks the product is an
effort to bridge the gap between Shaving
and skincare
om4 CEO mike Bruggeman stayed
and we formulate it to work in a short
burst of time by using a bio
accumulative emulsifier which enables
the mass to work if used three times per
week without leaving it rest for a full
five minutes the mass are available in
four different types advanced anti-aging
intercepting hydration buffer free
radical defense cream purifying oil
control mud and soothing sensitive
relief gel the master available on om
fors website there are some of us to
remember the days where high-end
cosmetics were only accessible in
department stores the entryway with all
the brand-name counters dazzling glass
cases blindingly lit and filled to the
brim with populist packaging the
cosmetic counters were once the
centerpiece of any department store but
those days are starting to dwindle as
more and more specialty stores are not
only stocking higher-end cosmetics but
offering regular discounts on them Ulta
Sephora the brand own e-commerce and
other outlets have department stores
changing their game in the past 10 years
a huge increase in customers patronising
Sephora Ulta and other specialty beauty
stores has resulted in them snatching up
a 20% market share that in turn calls
the once dominant department stores to
drop from 23% to 19% those numbers may
not give you the big picture so let's
take a broader view of it in 2015 there
was a whopping 13 billion dollars spent
on cosmetics over half of that money was
spent in drugs food and club stores and
in the previously mentioned 20% that is
going to specialty beauty stores and 11%
going to online shopping the whole
picture comes into view what's the
bottom line for you discounts sometimes
huge discounts more department stores
are jumping on the sale bandwagon when
it comes to cosmetics
some of them are even starting up their
own customary rewards program more
savings in your pocket can mean more
revenues in their coffers and any makeup
lover will tell you that Estee Lauder
Double Wear foundation is a Holy Grail
product for many with a wide shade range
and desirable formula from enthusiasts
to pro all agree that there's only one
thing missing but step the world Estee
Lauder has announced that the missing
item is now available of pump while the
pump does not come with the product
itself you can now purchase one for only
$10 on the Estee Lauder website also
make these or bloomer
during sight there is one thing that
really makes a beauty lovers jingle the
opportunities it can cut your own
special blend now if you're in New York
City you can visit these st. Ives mixing
bar to create your own custom facial
scrub the process starts with st. Ives
signature base and then customers can
choose from over 50 natural ingredients
such as avocado oil honey
pistachio extract and watermelon yes
watermelon then the mixture is blended
to a creamy texture next pick an
exfoliant like pomegranate seed powder
or volcanic sand to have mixed into your
customized facial scrub and it's done
not in describes the mixing bar also
offers fun things to do like customizing
your own lotions photo-ops in the
apricot room and even testing out new
products Kim kardashian-west k'kaw
Beauty has been hit with a lawsuit from
organic beauty brand care wife
apparently this is over the brand's logo
design which is similar to the organic
brands packaging court documents
obtained by TMZ contain a statement by
owner Kirsten Kerr wife that the logos
are confusingly similar and hinder her
company's success a statement that the
kardashian team is said to refute as
part of the lawsuit care wife is asking
that she be awarded payment for profit
and additional damages and requesting
that kardashian-west ceased use of the
initials can you name the mass-market
brand with the most loyal customer base
we'll give you a moment to think about
it do-do-do-do-do-do all right times up
according to a beauty product loyalty
report by marketing company Cora the
answer is covergirl the survey which
looked at over 1,000 women over the age
of 18 showed that over half of covergirl
users were said to have stayed loyal to
the brand for five years or more the
report stated that this was partly due
to the brand new approach to diversity
Illustrated among other examples by
naming James Charles as their first male
covergirl and finally there seems to be
a product on the market for just about
anything you can imagine for instance
ever considered how spiffy your nether
regions to be yes now there is a product
to help you get your vajayjay just as
bright and shiny as your cheekbones
thanks to the perfect fees
shade of the very V Luminizer your veg
can now glow to the gods avoiding to
their website they claim the product
will add luminous iridescent color to
your vulva area while brightening and
minimizing any skin imperfections but
there's a catch the product is currently
only available in Scandinavia
