racist and is L'Oreal ripping off a monk
I'm not even kidding I'm Jen from Chen
Lowe's reviews and what's up in makeup
starts now welcome to what's been makeup
for September 10th 2017 let's get
started with the top industry news
youtuber Kim Tai has severed relations
with Oprah cosmetics the brand had
collaborated with Thai on a water and
aloe vera gel based moisturizer called
wander lush details are still nebulous
at the moment but Kim tweeted this all I
can say is if you're going to trash talk
someone don't accidentally send it to
them true colors will always show and
quote disappointed and extremely hurt as
of now the moisturizer is still
available for sale at Ophir cosmetics
calm for the original price of $29 no
word from Oprah about whether this
product will be removed from their line
now get this L'Oreal is being sued by
Dennis Wis Kowski he's a former Roman
Catholic monk and according to the
Associated Press
L'Oreal appropriated wisk housekeys
patented technology to use in its
anti-aging Revitalift products the
technology in question is called easy
mine which was developed by scientists
at the University of Massachusetts
Medical School and featuring adenosine
it's a chemical compound found in the
heart that can purportedly boosts skin
elasticity in 2009 the cream was
licensed to whisk au ski which allowed
him to sell it for $65 a tube to benefit
the Therese Ian Carmelites their
religious charity that works with poor
prisoners addicts and children the
lawsuit was filed in June for
unspecified damages L'Oreal has asked
the case to be dismissed because the
product adenosine falls outside the
patents terms quote for me
L'Oreal pillaged the pour that's what
they did was Kowski told The Associated
Press a recent article in Forbes has
revealed that a Balkan war refugee could
incur heavy fines simply for teaching
makeup techniques
Jasna bulk Vic Bayani studied makeup
artistry in college back in Sarajevo and
after becoming a u.s. citizen created
her own studio in Charlotte North
Carolina
once this succeeded she decided to
expand with a school to teach me
of techniques to prose and to regular
folks and then the regulator's caught
wind the North Carolina Board of
cosmetic arts examiners chief of
enforcement went to her studio and said
she could not hold her courses unless
she became a licensed aesthetician
teacher that license will require her to
teach the state's entire 600-hour
aesthetician curriculum including
subjects completely irrelevant to makeup
techniques such as aromatherapy she
would have to spend at least $10,000 to
buy equipment that has nothing to do
with makeup artistry including a thermal
wax system and a galvanic current
apparatus which just sounds really scary
in response Jasna has partnered with the
Institute for justice and sued North
Carolina officials for stopping her
right to free speech their argument is
teaching is speech and is protected by
the First Amendment the Institute for
justice attorney Malad and mom says it
does not make sense to force makeup
artists like Jasna to spend hundreds of
hours teaching skills makeup artists and
just do not use the case puts up a major
precedent more than 30 states require
licenses from makeup artists while
several federal courts have already
ruled that occupational licenses stifle
free speech for other entrepreneurs
targets rolling out an exclusive
k-beauty brand noting that this is one
of the fastest growing categories in
premium skincare the big-box retailer is
launching glo studio in partnership with
e-commerce site and Korea Beauty Expert
glow recipe it will feature four step
routine kits that simplify a topical ten
step Korean beauty regimen and Korea
beauty routines are most more focused on
prevention rather than treating issues
like acne or wrinkles target explained
glow Studios is in stores at target.com
now at prices ranging from five dollars
to thirty eight dollars if you've been
on Instagram for a while you know all
about hashtag woman crush Wednesday
recently instead of giving someone else
a shout-out one makeup artist decided to
show herself a little love Talia
Reynolds aka Miss Betty WAP online used
the hashtag to celebrate her own
uniqueness yes
I'm cross-eyed and I love it she told
her 23,000 followers
Talia goes on to say I have my days
where it gets me down she's also dealt
with bullying and
threats from people who don't accept the
unconventional but she hopes it by
sharing her message she could inspire
others to show more kindness love
yourself and show love to others you
never know what someone is going through
she added I wish the world was a better
place but it starts with us you've
probably seen the bombs meet matrimony
palette but it's now sparked an
interesting question from Metro Co UK
writer Miranda Larbi is this makeup
palette racist or just mega dumb lobby
goes on to explain that she believes
quote were entering a golden era of
ethnic diversity in fashion and beauty
and in her opinion the nine shades seem
to have been stereotypically named after
people assumed to be of that color
there's Matt Lin for the paler shade
matt lopez for tan and black for matt
ahmed however Matt Moskowitz is plumb
matt rossi is taupe and Matt Reed is
umber can that be considered racist so
we're going to post lobby's question to
you is this makeup palette racist or
just mega dumb or something else we'd
love to know your thoughts in the
comments below and finally the perfect
