anger folks are concerned that this will
mean a change in the formulas and
downsizing in quality well we shall see

Beauty makeup lovers might forget their
makeup kits but they will never forget
their phones with that in mind meets the
Pelt case a bone case that allows for
easy and discreet transport of your
makeup the founder came up with the idea
after trying to find a way to hide or
compact during the meeting she attached
a compact to her phone with a hair tie
and this idea was born the case has a
slide-out compartment that houses a
customizable palette choosing between
the four shades of foundation seven
shades of lipstick and one clear gloss
is the most complicated thing about the
case which is
up comes in four colors the pout case is
now available for pre-order but the
price of convenience does not come cheap
the case itself will run you 38 dollars
and then you can choose up to three of
the cosmetic shades for an additional
$25 near an avid YouTube watcher and
love makeup then you may be familiar
with the channel Hank in Henry he takes
using color to another level with purple
and cobalt I paired with a vampy plum
lip to a sultry black and gray smokey
eyes look with this bright turquoise lip
with all that love for makeup and skills
is no shock that he himself is launching
his own cosmetic brand this announcement
came out on his Instagram page with
little information other than it's what
I've been working so hard for and that
it's coming fall of 2017 so for now
that's what I can say Kim
kardashian-west announced that she'll be
launching her own makeup line called
k'kaw beauty on June 21st post on the
new brand Instagram indicate that the
first product will be a contour and
highlight kit in fair medium dark and
deep dark and it is the promotional
material for this product that brings us
to the point of controversy specifically
this photo it shows Kim looking super
stunning as usual with her signature
heavy contour but some are accusing her
of going black face and that has drawn
some interesting tweets like me how did
a team of PR people look at the photo of
Kim in blackface and then tell her to
post it and make it her Abby black women
get told to lighten meanwhile Kim spent
her entire career in perpetual blackface
and is lauded for her beauty and hoopla
Kim K in blackface for her ad why is she
a hundred years late with a contour kit
some might say this is simply an
editorial filter on the photo what do
