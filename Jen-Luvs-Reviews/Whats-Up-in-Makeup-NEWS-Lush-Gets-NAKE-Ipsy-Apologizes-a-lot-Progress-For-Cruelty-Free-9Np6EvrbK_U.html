subscription service FC was under fire
this week by the LGBTQI community after
an attempt to release a pride themed ad
the flying colors video featured a woman
a lesbian named Cassandra saying there's
definitely a spectrum between trans
women between authentic cisgendered
women and everything in between
the issue taken was with Cassandra
statement assuming that trans women are
not authentic social media Bleu
subscribers threatened to cancel and if
C's choice to delete social media
comments only called more attention to
the issue in the video if C then
released a statement saying a quote
unfortunately we missed the mark in a
very big way our sincere apologies to
anyone that we hurt with the thoughtless
comments included in the video that
seemed to imply that trans women were
not authentic women it was a big mistake
and oversight to have included that line
in what was meant to be
celebration of inclusivity we realize we
really messed up and that we still have
a lot to learn if she has since released
the second statement enforcing their
commitment to the apology highlighting
that they're seeking social media
moderation training making efforts to
support and work with the lgbtq+
community in order to ensure appropriate
content and welcoming suggestions from
the consumer community that closed the

cosmetics a resolution or Senate joint
resolution twenty two calls for Congress

some new members of the U crew joined
them including this other Revlon this al
may cover girls with 30 different model

reporter should apply for a part-time
summer job just to see what actually
happens in the cosmetic aisle and if
there really was some mysterious vendor
who never came back to change the
products out
but we're not stopping there this is
becoming part of a chronic problem
