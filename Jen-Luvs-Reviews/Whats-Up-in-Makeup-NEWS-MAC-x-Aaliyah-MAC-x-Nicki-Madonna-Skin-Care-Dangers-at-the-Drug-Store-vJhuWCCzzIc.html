signs the checks and entering the u.s.
arena it's Madonna I'm Jen from Jen
Lowe's reviews and what's up in makeup
starts now welcome to what's been makeup
for August 27th 2017 let's get started
with the top industry news first makeup
trivia Mac fans might remember a pink
for Friday the Bubblegum at pink
lipstick shade that Mac and Nicki Minaj
created together a while back well Mac
is teaming up with Nicki Minaj again and
the collab will be here sooner than you
might think

lipsticks including two shades called
Nicki's nude and pink print that were
created by Miss Minaj herself 17 50 each
the collection is scheduled for launch
in stores and online on September 21st
and as a limited edition they are saying
it will be gone by October 19th and last
week Mac announced that they will be
honoring the memory of Aaliyah in a
press statement Mac said Aaliyah is
truly one in a million an unstoppable
icon whose groundbreaking work inspires
us all adding quote today we join her
countless fans in celebrating her with
the announcement of the Mac Aaliyah
collection you made it happen the only
detail we know is that it will be
available in summer of 2018 all shades
in the L'Oreal Ballman collab have now
been revealed and there are 12 color
riche matte shades
they'll be divided into three color
collections get your Safari look this is
rock and this is couture with each
having different marble tubes here's a
close-up of the stunning packaging the
entire collection will be up for grabs
at L'Oreal Paris USA on September 20th
the struggle to find the perfect shade
of nude is eternal possibly even more so
when you're a person of color that is
the exact struggle that inspired KJ
Miller and Amanda Johnson to start the
brand mented cosmetics creating
lipsticks and nail polishes for women of
color by women of color the brand with
the name formed from the word pigmented
will continue their success with the
gloss for grown-ups collection for
it's called baby brown milk chocolate
bury me a deep raspberry mauve over a
dusty mauve and send nudes a caramel
each with just the right amount of
pigment to not disappear completely on
deeper skin tones show of hands who here
loves Madonna skincare line not too many
hands well that's because in the past
few years it's only been available in
Japan but it's finally coming to the US
on September 26th according to Women's
Wear Daily the singer said I developed
it for me specifically but it also feels
universal I mean my children use it my
friends use it the entire line includes
face and eye products masks and removers
ranging from $50 to $240 there is a
rejuvenator set for $600 more products
will launch in November and in early
January Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson has been
ordered to pay damages in the amount of
417 million dollars due to the effects
of their Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson baby powder
on a 63 year old woman from California
the plaintiff ever at Chavarria
developed ovarian cancer after using the
product starting at age 11 I won't get
into the whole backstory of the powder
but I'll link information in the video
description for the American Cancer
Society regarding talcum powder is
potential link to ovarian cancer a chav
areas stopped using the powder in as of
2016 but stated that had the product had
a warning label
she would have discontinued using it
years ago so why is there no warning
label and that's because Johnson &amp;amp;
Johnson baby powder is legally
considered a cosmetic product not a drug
it's therefore not subject to review by
the US Food and Drug Administration like
a drug would be but it would have to be
properly labeled with ingredients and
other information and the product quote
must be safe for use by consumers under
labeled or customary conditions of use
according to the agency this is not the
first case that Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson has
faced under the same claims many
plaintiffs have already received
resolution and there's still many other
cases continuing to be fought throughout
the states we bring you the story as a
reminder buyer beware on a lighter note
you need just an extra five minutes to
perfect your eye look wouldn't it be
great to be at Hogwarts with
access to a time Turner voilá time
Turner brushes no guarantee to rollback
time but they could help you with a fear
