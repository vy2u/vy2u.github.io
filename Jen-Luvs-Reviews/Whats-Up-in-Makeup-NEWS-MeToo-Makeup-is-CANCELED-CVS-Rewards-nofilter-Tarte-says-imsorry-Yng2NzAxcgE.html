moment in the makeup world want to act
slick and make money off someone else's
art not today it was not long before

we all had to decide what makeup to take
on vacation and
the festive and asked what makeup we
would want on a deserted island well
have you ever wondered about makeup in
space nASA has during the 1970s NASA
took some time to think about what a
woman would want in space with them
Sally Ride the first woman in space
noted the engineers at NASA and their
infinite wisdom decided that women Oz
astronauts would want makeup can you
just imagine the discussion amongst the
predominantly male engineers about what
should go in a space makeup kit
as an aside these same engineers asked
Sally if 100 tampons would be adequate
for her one-week journey through space
the kit which included mascara eyeliner
blush eye shadow I makeup remover and
lip gloss but oddly enough no
applicators or cotton pads never made it
into space but I guess we have to give
the engineers credit for at least trying
to get it right the next wave of skin
protection is here super goups new
unseen sunscreen will guard your face
not only from UVA and UVB but also
visible blue light this type of blue
light emitted by your cell phone is the
most damaging of the visible lights and

customers on beauty blenders website
reported fraudulent charges made after
their purchases in an investigation by
the company's website service provider

confirmed that over 3,000 customers
could be affected by a security breach
the investigation showed that the
brand's website was infected with
malware that takes customer information
at checkout however the date the virus
infected the website could not be
determined due to a lack of data backups
by the company that would have revealed
changes in the website coding the
malware has since been removed but
Beautyblender is now contacting all of
those individuals who may have been
affected by the breach Padma Lakshmi Top
