some new holiday and do natural
ingredients really make a difference I'm
Jen from Jen loves reviews and what's a
good makeup starts now welcome to what's
up and make up for October 8th 2017
let's get started with the top industry
news
you probably recognize the name Michelle
Phan from YouTube tipsy her footprints
are well settled in the industry gram
cosmetics line created with L'Oreal was
not selling well after that Phan took
some time off to travel the world and
find her footing once again
since then she has purchased em back
reworked the products and relaunched
with brand new formulas now michelle has
reached an agreement with FC to divest
em to her new company divinium labs LLC
as part of this agreement she will
devote her time to divinium leaving FC
in the hands of its other two founding
partners and those would be marcelo
cambros and Jennifer Goldfarb and an
email sent out by Goldfarb she stated
Michelle was instrumental in bringing
both hip C Open Studios and FC
generation Beauty to life and those
programs are now thriving and growing
with more than 8,000 creators as part of
FC open studios and for successful
generation beauty events each year hip
c1l launched an e-commerce platform
called FC shopper which will enable
members to buy full-size products
starting in November anasazi Beverly
Hills is adding more reason to get
excited for this holiday season the
brand has released ten items ranging
from eyeshadow to lippies to add some
cheer and sparkle to any collection here
are some of the highlights the prism
eyeshadow palette with 14 shades
including duo chromes and metallics $42
holiday blush kit and radiant or

Burberry fragrances cosmetics and skin
care Coty will have overall
responsibility for strategic direction
and Burberry will lead on creative
elements Burberry beauty products will
continue to be so
and leading luxury beauty retailers
globally as well as in Burberry stores
and digital channels are you ready for
more cover girls introducing fitness
trainer Massey arias and motorcycle
racer show Linda Morita and
announcements on their instagrams Morita
said I go on track with my makeup on my
makeup sets me apart from the guys when
I'm here DUP on the grind and all you
can see are my eyes peering out of my
helmet or a de caption to her photo
having my makeup on makes me feel strong
and confident Aria shares a similar
experience explaining that even a
powerful red lip can motivate her that
much more in the gym there are times I
proudly rock a full face especially when
I'm filming and want that extra dose of
confidence before putting myself out
there in front of millions of people she
said doesn't it make you wonder who's
next amazing cosmetics the cult classic
beauty brand that has been around for
nearly two decades has announced they
will be branching out to form
partnerships with new retailers first up
on this list Amazon which has become a
one-stop beauty shopping resource for
the net amazing founder sue cat stated
everything's changed about retail where
the customers going to buy and how she's
buying and it's really up to us as a
brand to make ourselves available where
she is and cater to her habits it became
extremely clear to us that Amazon is
where she is I'm wondering about
thinking about where he is I wish they
changed that language just a little bit
but that's my personal thoughts there
the brand will also be releasing their
illuminating primer highlighter and rose
gold pearl and bronze at Ulta as well as
an exclusive primer at QVC we've all
done it pick a product off the shelf
look for the ingredient list and wonder
what back many of them are and then put
it back on the shelf consumers are
becoming more and more aware of what
ingredients mean and looking for a
higher level of green and sustainable
ingredients many companies such as CVS
and Target have been taking steps to
remove products with unwanted chemicals
from their shelves now Walmart is
following the same path moving forward
to reduce their chemical footprint by 10
percent over the next five years the
company is making a pledge to be more
transparent in their
Department and pushing for sustainable
packaging as well as cleaner products
starting in 2018 all priority chemicals
and products will be required to be
disclosed by suppliers Zach Freese
senior director of strategic initiatives
for sustainability at Walmart stated we
know our customers are interested in
what goes into products and how they are
made it's important for them and we are
advocating for them by encouraging
innovation and transparency into that
process this may seem like a new trend
but it's been a long time coming
compared to countries such as Australia
and the UK the u.s. is lagging far
behind in a beauty ingredient
