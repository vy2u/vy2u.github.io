silence Beyonce has been dethroned as
the most valuable influencer according
to social media tracking firm @d Emery
Analytics the crown has been passed to
beauty brand owner Kylie Jenner liquid
lipstick Queen makes an estimated 1
million dollars of her Instagram post
with our current count of posts topping
over 5,000 Demery analytics looked at
engagement statistics for example like
how many people interact with the post
either by liking clicking on or
commenting on them number followers was
not factored into the research and since
not all of Kylie's posts are
endorsements the team assigned
a value to each individual demographic
of her followers to help determine how
much she would make per post if it were
an ad posting about products like sugar
bear hair gummies fit tea wraps and her
own Kylee cosmetic products on Instagram
continually brings her profit because
people actually buy what she promotes
she's seen a recent spike in engagement
since posting about her baby stormy when
Kylie announced her daughter's name via
a post it became the most liked photo in
Instagram history Frank a spotter for
SEO of Dee Marie analytics said quote
kylie is an undeniable global brand
which may make some roll their eyes but
the reality is this young female
entrepreneurs savvy helped her reach a
milestone in the influencer marketing
and advertising industry which many
seasoned professionals have failed to
achieve and one more silent moment this
