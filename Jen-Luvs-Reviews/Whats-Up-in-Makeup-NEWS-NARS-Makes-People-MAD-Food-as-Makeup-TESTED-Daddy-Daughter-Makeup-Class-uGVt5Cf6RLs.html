to Generation Beauty Toronto,
to Montreal…
I'm Jen from JenLuvsReviews and What's Up
In Makeup is back and starting now!
Welcome to What's Up In Makeup for July 2,
2017...on this episode we are reviewing the
Top Industry News of the past week or so.
This week's major story -- Nars has decided
to sell its products in China, meaning that
the popular brand is getting its
share of controversy.
In 2013, the EU banned the sale of any cosmetics
or ingredients that have been tested on animals.
In the U.S., animal testing is not illegal,
but is left up to the company's discretion.
But in China, animal testing is the law.
Some users of the social media platform Weibo,
in China, said they felt &quot;more assured&quot; of
quality after products were tested.
But it's more than assuring potential customers...
China is projected to become the largest market
in the world for the cosmetics industry, with
an estimated $50 billion in domestic sales
of beauty products in 2015 alone.
And that's a siren song that is difficult
to ignore.
Currently, brands like L'Oreal, Benefit, Rimmel,
Maybelline and Shiseido (which owns Nars)
are among the many cosmetic products sold
in China.
Each is subject to the animal testing law.
Nars has issued a statement on their Instagram,
saying, &quot;We want you to know that we hear
you.
The global elimination of animal testing needs
to happen&quot; but that it had to &quot;comply with
the local laws.&quot;
You can see that statement, and the reactions
to it, on their Instagram account @narsissist.
And those reactions are resoundingly negative.
The company has been accused of caring &quot;more
about profits than animal welfare,&quot; and another
noted &quot;This is called hypocrisy.&quot;
Let us know your thoughts in the comments
below.
On YouTube, Ms Yeah is known mainly for unusual
cooking videos, but one of her most recent
videos shows an interesting way to use food
(and office paraphernalia) as makeup.
The video went viral and I know I saw it all over Facebook.
LIfehacker's Claire Lower also enjoyed the
video, enough to try to recreate the effect.
She didn't have the exact same ingredients
Ms Yeah did, but tried her best with flour
and cocoa powder for foundation, contouring
with cocoa, coffee for eyebrows and a regular
pen for eyeliner.
For shadow, she used green skittle water with
flour, and strawberries with ketchup for the
lips. Was she successful?
Check out the full results at lifehacker.com
&quot;Real Housewives of Potomac&quot; Star, Gizelle Bryan
has officially launched EveryHue Beauty
after two years of development.
The brand includes a tinted moisturizer (available
in 12 different shades), a foundation brush
and blending sponge.
The formula includes vitamin C and E, aloe,
and has SPF 25.
Bryant told PeopleStyle, “I, with my silly
self, thought it would take six months [to
create].
There were some formulations that we came
up with that were good but they weren’t
great and I didn’t want to come out with
something that wasn’t great that I didn’t
believe in.”
Watch for EveryHue items to roll out every
three months.
Next up is a trio compact that includes a
highlighter, a setting powder and a bronzer,
which will be available in two color hues.
Following that will be a matte lip with top
gloss.
Glow Perfect Tinted Moisturizer, $36.

We've told you before about Beauty Pie, the
membership-only makeup outlet that launched
last December.
With a mission statement of low-priced makeup,
under the belief that &quot;Most luxury skincare
has a price markup of 10 times the cost it
takes to manufacture it&quot;, the brand has many
fans and members...including Bobbi Brown.
At the end of May, Beauty Pie unveiled skincare
products in their online mix.
The skincare line now includes 11 products,
with prices from $5.21 to $13.11, and range
from a cleanser to micro-peel drops, to an
anti-aging cream and a Korean-style mask.
Future goals include a retinol range, a vitamin
C range, and super hydrating products.
Even adding in the $10 monthly membership
fee, this is definitely a bargain compared
to mainstream products.
Blushington is the place to go when you want
to get a special makeup application, and you're
in California, New York or Texas.
With that in mind, what better idea could
they have than to establish a Father's Day
celebration Makeup 101 class, to teach tweens
and Dads makeup from the ground up?
Well now, it's a permanent part of the beauty
lounge's menu.
It was such a hit for both girls and their
pops who want to understand where the contour
goes.
&quot;What really struck me out of our class was
this was the child sharing her passion with
the parent,&quot; adds Blushington CEO Natasha
Cornstein . &quot;It's a complete role reversal....The
dads have been completely hands-on — we
even had some of them testing Jouer lip prep
on themselves.&quot;
During the 90-minute group course, which costs
$50 per father-daughter team, both work with
an expert to learn about which products to
use and when, and they then take turns applying
the product with the proper tools.
The average participant is between the ages
of 11 and 14...prime seekers of YouTube tutorials,
but Blushington is more about age-appropriate
looks.
Makeup 101 courses are available at two locations
in Southern California, in Manhattan and Dallas.
And last up for this week, I've got a bunch of little stories for you
kind of like a lightning round but not that fast 'cause I just couldn't spit this out
in a lightning round format. The first one I want to tell you about is
Unilever has severed ties with Sawit Sumbermas
Sarana, a supplier of palm oil, because of
issues with their deforestation practices.
They are the latest company to cut ties with
SSMS since 2015.
a team of scientists from the Estee Lauder
companies recently presented data on the effects
of Pollen on skin, and what ingredients can
lessen those effects
Olay is always looking for new ingredients
that promote cell regeneration, and they are
currently investigating the properties of
Carob as an ingredient
German cosmetics brand, BeYu, will launch
300 stores in India
L'Oréal's is in the process of pulling its
Decléor brand from the US market, because
basically, no one knows what it is. I don't even know how to say it.
And Huda Kattan has been named to TIME's list
of the top 25 most influential people on the
internet
That's it for now, don't forget the Daily
Makeup Minute, 60 seconds of news you can
use Monday through Friday starts up again tomorrow.

products that I received at Generation Beauty
in Toronto.
