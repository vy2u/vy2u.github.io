pedaling CTF G and some clues about the
fate of OCC I'm Jen from Jen Lowe's
reviews and what's been makeup starts
now welcome to what's up and makeup for
april 29th
2018 let's get started with the top
industry news underneath we are women is
a statement and Instagram handle and a
movement started by Amy Herman and
Australian photographer underneath we
are women will display 100 females in
their underwear and share their unique
stories with the masses the ladies will
appear in an accompanying coffee table
book attempting to reinforce the concept
that each of us has our own beautiful

calm Procter &amp;amp; Gamble announced their
sustainability plan called ambition 2030
the plan includes points on packaging
supply chain management societal
partnerships and employee development
and hopes built relationships while
slashing pollution and waste by 2030
because they already met rather
aggressively most of their 2020 goals
Procter &amp;amp; Gamble's chairman David Taylor
explained consumers expect the brand's
they trust and deliver superior
performance and to also help solve some
of the most complex challenges facing
our world a keen eye might notice a
game-changing tweak in beauty bakeries
cake mix foundation shade range the
shades are in order from number one
being the darkest to number 59 being the
lightest CEO cashmere Nicole tweeted for
our cake mix foundation launch I knew
what was going to be important to me as
a black woman there are constant
reminders sometimes subtle sometimes a
little more overt everywhere that women
of color are only second best that is
why I ordered our foundation is from
dark to light the change directly
challenges the reality that shades are
most often listed from light to dark
beauty bakery showcases their diverse
range at the forefront of their
advertising and social media creating
ways ensuring accessibility to the
perfect shade for everyone
web based Beauty giant glossier has an
a second store in Melrose California the
1,500 square foot store will serve as
its West Coast showroom after having
several successful pop ups in the area
and steady sales at their store in New
York the store will have an interior
theme that is inspired by a road trip
through the California desert CEO Emily
Weiss tells Los Angeles magazine quote
we want to make a very unique and
special experience and hinted at
something that may be called a selfie
Canyon inside the Melrose shop but that
is about all there letting slip opening
is currently scheduled from a high
school senior Julian Ramirez capitalized
on his crushes love of makeup went
asking her to prom his promposal
included a set of Brett moon rocks
Morphy cloud products and a sign that
read Ally's a make me blush by being the
highlight to my prom thankfully Ally's
they said yes and Ramirez was retweeted
by Brett moon rock himself his photos on
social media have inspired similar signs
which often look like makeup palettes
popping up punny prom proposals we've
got another buyer beware for you this
week third-party sellers on Amazon it
may not be what they seem and neither
are their products
the online giant claims to spend
significant resources fighting
counterfeit sellers and the legitimate
companies that are affected by fake
product sales yet several lawsuits have
been filed against Amazon claiming their
failure to discourage counterfeit sales
in its third-party marketplace this
could possibly affect your next beauty
binge through the site be sure you are
purchasing directly from the brand
themselves or from authorized retailers
and check the price descriptions and
photos like we said last week if it
seems too good to be true it's probably
crap cannabadiol
also known as CBD is a non psychoactive
cannabis plant extract it is becoming
increasingly popular in cosmetics you
might recognize it from milks at new
cush mascara and its appearance in lip
balms and lotions CBD is a relatively
new addition to product and as an
ingredient is recognized for its
versatility and benefits from being
vegan because it's new its quality
regulation remains unclear where
supplement pharmaceutical and topical
aspects are concerned so exercise
caution
your purchase make sure that the source
is legitimate as with milks mascara and
don't be fooled by excessive claims
L'Oreal Shane wolf global manager of

has debuted his own line under the
company seed phytonutrients is the
intrapreneurial effort and is currently
available online the line of 16 products
is formulated with us sourced organic
seeds packaging is a mix of glass and
recycled paper from L'Oreal facilities
and is produced by ecologic brands Wolfe
causes development group the seed squad
saying quote we brought together a group
of experts around two ideas one was
about saving the seeds and one was about
supporting independent organic farmers
products are available for hair face and
body
the larimar association for people who
are blind in Sao Paulo Brazil is
offering makeup courses in partnership
with Jacque Jean salon rail labels are
added to brushes and products to assist
in forming familiarity
they are also taught how to apply false
eyelashes attendee Maria expressed her
excitement who says I can't see my face
maybe not like other people but I
imagine my face and I believe I am
beautiful the class is making the
practice of applying makeup more
accessible and building confidence in
the women who attend partnering with
large retailers can be a dream come true
too small beauty brands but the
maintenance costs associated
could make or break the bank and from
that statement we may have a clue in
what happened to obsessive compulsive
cosmetics the popular brand rumored to
have shut its doors has a history of
struggling to keep up with Sephora's
partnership costs two lawsuits dating
back to 2015 revealed some of the
company's setbacks in the first occ
sought restitution for costs of store
fixtures and loss of revenue after
allowing Sephora to become their brick
and mortar retailer OCC allegedly
negotiated these terms when they agreed
to work with Sephora but the plans were
not fully executed instead OCC paid for
their store fixtures this is customary
and gaining shelf space in store but
we're not compensated for losses accrued
due to exclusivity with Sephora the
second lawsuit tried to claim back funds
lost due to Sephora's discount and
subsequent liquidation of OCC's products
during their partnership termination it
stated if provision
relief is not granted OCC will suffer
irreparable harm because an immediate
markdown of the outstanding inventory
would have financially devastating
effect and mood any award of damages
while the resolution of both lawsuits
and OCC's current retail status are not
publicly available the story of the
behind the scenes costs associated with
Sephora partnership is quite telling
OCC's operating status still has not
been communicated to the public on a
happier note earlier this year CVS
introduced the CVS beauty mark a
watermark that will appear on imagery
that has not been altered like through
Photoshop and things like that
last week the retail chain kicked off
its beauty and real-life campaign the
first advertising campaign carrying the
CVS beauty mark which features a diverse
cast of women from all over the US and
retouched print and video imagery quote
there's been a shift in what customers
want to see when it comes to beauty
they're asking for more transparency and
authenticity and that's what beauty and
real life is all about said Norman de
Greve a senior vice president and chief
marketing officer CVS health in a press
release we wanted to introduce a
campaign that uses Beauty to make women
feel good about themselves by empowering
them to feel comfortable and confident
in their own skin beauty in real life is
the biggest beauty campaign CVS has ever
produced and it's worth noting that the
cast photographer director marketing and
Beauty teams involved in the ad campaign
for all female in contrast a L'Oreal ad
and a Milwaukee drugstore is causing a
media outcry the ad features Helen
Mirren Eva Longoria and Maria Borgess
Borgess who is from angola which is in
southern africa is the only spokeswoman
to be wearing a face mask this bothered
local woman Kristen Bell coffer who
shared it didn't make much sense at all
why the person of color that was
represented in the ad was the only
person wearing this lighter color mask
Belk offers shared her frustrations on
social media and her post was shared by
others who asked the cosmetic giant via
Twitter why only the black woman has her
face covered in the ad L'Oreal did
respond stating quote the display
combines images from three different
products Helen Mirren for age perfect
moisturizer Eva Longoria for Revitalift
cream and Maria Borges for pure
lay masks to ensure transparency in
campaigns for masks we always photograph
spokespeople with the product applied
our displays are updated routinely so
you can expect to see a new Bunsen and
speaking of things that may not always
be as they seem my Revlon foundations
were still there as of our reporters
most recent visit we think they may
always be there sort of like Blake
Narnia but what else is being consigned
to the eternal in the cosmetics aisle
this Maybelline stick foundation will
soon be old enough to start kindergarten
and these pencils will be their
classmates but wait we have news of
another cosmetic island peril
yet another what's it been makeup
community member found rapidly moldering
a Revlon foundation at a Publix in
Smyrna Tennessee
there were also Maybelline products that
were rapidly approaching their Twain
years
she took the items to the manager and
explained the situation but this is
where things change
one week later she returned to find the
entire cosmetic aisle had been cleaned
and all the expired products removed
well done in Publix so if they can do it
what about the others
we will continue to dig but in the
meantime we dig this jingle
