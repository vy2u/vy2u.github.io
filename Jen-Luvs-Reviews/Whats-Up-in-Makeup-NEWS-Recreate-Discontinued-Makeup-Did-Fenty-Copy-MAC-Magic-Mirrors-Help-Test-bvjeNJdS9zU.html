mirrors say you're the fairest and
please be careful with Rihanna's new
lipstick I'm Jen from Jen Lowe's reviews
and what's it been makeup starts now
welcome to what's up in makeup for
November 19th 2017 let's get started
with the top industry news millennial
pink strikes again the shade used for so
much packaging right now was also
spotted backstage at New York Fashion
Week where makeup artists were noted
using Maybelline lab samples of the new
coconut infused mascara total temptation
with a soft whipped mousse formula
it offers volume and length according to
Maybelline the scent is reported as
subtle more coconut butter than pina
colada
total temptation comes in brownish black
very black and blackest black and is
available on Amazon now or at drugstores
in January for at 9 dollars we've had
many news items recently cautioning
shoppers against using sketchy testers
now Mac has come up with a genius
solution a virtual try on a magic mirror
the modifies powered mirror uses
augmented reality to let the shopper try
on products virtually this effect is
achieved by the mirror mapping the
shoppers face 30 times per second down
to a fraction of a pixel you can try out
29 eye looks or 45 shades of Mac
pigments without having to apply and
remove Tim terrico Mac's SVP of global
creative visual merchandising and store
designs said quote we believe this will
be a game-changing addition to our
stores the magic mirrors are being
installed in u.s. stores at this time
and in global Mac stores in early 2018
speaking of Mac last week Mac announced
their collaboration with Patrick Starr
and now the brand has released
information on the full line there will
be a total of 12 products for the face
to eyeshadow quads
a $32 each three lipsticks $18 apiece
three lip glosses seventeen dollars
apiece three lip liners and the
previously announced face powder $34 all
will be available on Mac's website
December 14th just in time for the
holidays and will only
be available until January 11th 2018
Brianna's about to release a quote make
out proof lipstick in a bottle that
seems to closely mimic the packaging of
the Mack and Charlotte Olympia studios
nail lacquer a limited-edition product
that came out in March of 2016 the old
Hollywood deco style package features
the same sharply pointed metallic cap an
octagonal bottle with sharp ridges on
each point Mac is not accusing Fanti of
design stealing but you may want to
carefully read the print on the side of
the bottle if you have both items when
Serena Williams presented the supernova
award at Glamour's women of the Year
award she hired celebrity makeup artist
Renny Vasquez who exclusively used black
opal cosmetics to create Serena's
stunning look quote I used black opal
makeup to create a natural-looking yet
elegantly sculpted look that
complimented her high ponytail and black
Versace dress said runny among the black
opal products used on Serena were true
color pore perfecting liquid foundation
in black walnut true color skin
perfecting stick foundation in hazelnut
heavenly honey to highlight and ebony
Brown to contour and finally the
invisible oil blocking loose powder
great publicity for the drugstore beauty
brand Kim kardashian-west is no stranger
to social media marketing from sneak
peeks on snapchat to communicating
directly with fans on Twitter to sharing
personal moments on Instagram she noted
that she is in no rush however to have
her children follow in her footsteps and
an exclusive interview with WWD recently
she said you have to have a thick skin
which is a given you know the other day
it was so funny my daughter watches so
many YouTube tutorials and videos that
she was unboxing the My Little Pony
color pop collection and I thought to
myself I wish I was recording this
because her reaction was so funny and
then she didn't make up on the My Little
Pony that they gave and she said mom I
want to do a YouTube video are we about
to see another generation of social
media maven not quite yet Kim and Kanye
agreed that North could record a beauty
tutorial but it would only be available

jaca is a makeup line out of the UK

Jessica shared quote a lot of lgbtq+
community faced discrimination in some
form whether it's in public or in the

over the winter Jessica recently won the
Young Entrepreneur of the Year at the
SME Business Awards thanks to her new
inclusive line 24 year old beauty
vlogger Katherine Martinez was asked one
day to translate what was being said in
the video into American Sign Language
and an idea was born
Katherine realized that an entire
population was being left out and made
it her mission to start creating content
with ASL and closed captions a deaf
woman in my class would always ask me
about my makeup and I told her about the
Beauty vloggers I follow who give tips
Katherine told people chica but while
rewatching those tutorials she realized
that none would be helpful to her
classmates since they lack closed
captions
Catherine then decided to take a course
on sign language and created content
tailored to the deaf and
hearing-impaired brilliant catherine
received her degree in ASL studies
communicative studies and disorders
program at new york university she now
combines her degree with her love of
makeup by creating and sharing tutorials
on her instagram page and finally
Spotify is a great place to find new
sounds but now a partnership with March
bar Spotify has started to feature
artist makeup on their profile pages so
users can shop the look makeup artist
Pat McGrath is kicking off the
partnership by selling three shades of
her lipsticks and eye pencil and other
items for her beauty line to coincide
with the launch of a new singer single
from singer Maggie
Lindemann McGrath stated in this
digitally empowered digital era of
makeup where fans crave instant glamour
gratification I always want to reach
fans where they're most engaged that's
why this relationship with Spotify is
absolutely major because it merges
beauty and music in a whole new way
that's never been done before Jordan
Graham Lise pata Faiz head of artist and
fan development said in a statement
Maggie Lindemann is an extremely
exciting young artist with over 7
million fans listening to her all over
the world every month on Spotify and
partnering with Pat McGrath to offer
beauty products in this innovative way
she will be connecting directly with
their fans in the place where they go to
enjoy her music already spot if I had no
comment on whether the McGrath launch
will be the first of such beauty
partnerships and they also have no
comment on whether McGrath or merch bar
will be offering more items at a later
date but take note that Spotify will not
be taking a portion of the sales that
will happen through the platform this is
meant to allow artists more opportunity
for revenue beyond streaming in events
