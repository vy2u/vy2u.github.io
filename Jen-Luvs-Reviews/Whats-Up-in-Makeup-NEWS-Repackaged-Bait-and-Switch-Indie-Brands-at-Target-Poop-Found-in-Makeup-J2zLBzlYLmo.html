rewrite shopping history and counterfeit
cosmetics could leave you blistery I'm
Jen from Jen Lowe's reviews and what's
the make up starts now welcome back to
what's of in make up for April 22nd 2018
thank you so much for hanging with us
through our hiatus last week I had a
fantastic time at IMATS in New York I
also had the wonderful opportunity to do
a collaboration with my YouTube idol
Emily Noel 83 if you do not follow me on
other social medias that is what I was
doing earlier in the week so look out
for those videos hopefully Thursday of
this week that's the plan you are going
to love them now let's go ahead and jump
right in enough about me let's talk
about us and what we're interested in
let's go ahead and jump right into top
industry news controversy over labels
was the buzz of the week first it was
the near controversy when someone
happened to peel the label on a color
pop palette only to discover that it was
meant to be an entirely different
palette that you had me at hello pallet
dropped in October of 2017 but it was
meant to have another life as a cloud
palette with kathleenlights called
Lumina but was this a shady move forced
into play by Kathleen's controversy over
a certain word said during gameplay
which was captured by Jacqueline Hill
well colour-pop says no according to
them that palette packaging was simply
repurposed from our project that was
pulled projects and collabs are
cancelled often and at different stages
it would seem that this one was
cancelled after the packaging had
arrived so stickers were placed on the
front and back making it into the
palette we know today we'll never really
know what caused the cancellation that's
information internal the colour-pop but
this particular mystery for now has come
to an end however just as one case
closed another one opened the Urban
Decay Velvet Iser came under fire when
more than one person peeled the label on
the jar only to find the words naked
finishing
a product that was in the process of
being discontinued urban decay issued a
statement that they were simply
recycling existing containers and while
the two products were similar one is
translucent the other is pigmented and
the two have very different formulas but
putting the ingredient junky that I am
of course I had to compare the Velvet
Iser ingredients to the naked skin and
what did I find
the ingredient list is near to identical
emphasis on the near tho both products
have the same eight ingredients in the
same order down to the pigments listed
with two changes that should be noted
the biggest change to the Velvet Iser
is the addition of nano silica this may
significantly change the texture and
performance of the product but a
side-by-side test would probably be
necessary to know for sure the second is
that mica has moved from does contained
in the naked skin light to may contain
in the Velvet Iser this might be the
change from a pigmented naked skin to a
translucent velvet Iser
it's important to recognize that even
when ingredients are listed in the same
order that doesn't necessarily mean that
the same concentrations were used they
could be the same but they may not be
urban decay claims that the consistency
is similar and that they have very
different formulations I'm not sure if I
would agree with that statement but it
is possible that they are different just
not very different
only Urban Decay knows for sure given
that both products were launched at the
$34 price tag it doesn't seem to me that
urban decay is trying to pull a fast one
more that they were probably trying to
refresh and improve on existing product
and as they claimed recycling the jars
any team that grew up with a selfie
stick in hand will tout the importance
of their online image on their social
life the sentiment is reflected in the
growing popularity of cosmetic sales in
the gen Z age bracket beauty and self
care products are second on the list of
priority purchases to female teens with
food spending at number one what their
digital presence is affecting marketing
and completely novel ways forcing beauty
companies to maintain a heavy social
marketing presence gen Z spends an
average of $368 a year on beauty
products according to global cosmetic
news supporting the
130 billion dollars in annual retail
sales your next watch party could be
instagram-worthy
a market of swatch stencils available on
Etsy offer fun designs ranging from
Chevron's to unicorn horns the stencils
retail for less than five dollars and
are reusable do you think swatches are
as important as the product themselves

know in the comments below the
Environmental Protection Agency has
developed a policy targeting reduction
in animal testing now wait for it

testing on cosmetics and skin care the
methods described in the policy can be
used immediately and the EPA has asked
for comments on the document by June of
this year the EPA anticipates that their
policy will decrease animal testing and
encourage the use of alternative
measures Italian brand bio on will

Christina hennington
targets senior vice president of beauty
said target has been working over the
years to ensure its offerings are as
diverse as its customers this is the
year we decided we need to do deeper
work on our cosmetics side of the
business and making sure we're inclusive
and we're finding products that are
relevant to our guests that have deeper
skin tone she said as the United States
becomes more multicultural and
multi-ethnic we need to be responsive as
a retailer the brands were either a
found by target through social media and
market research or reached out to Target
hoping for shelf space the lineup is
available now on target's website and
will be in store on May 20th this story
has been all over the net but we of
course have got to talk about it whether
we want to or not because it's relevant
yet disgusting the Los Angeles Police
Department found human waste
and bacteria in a massive amount of
counterfeit makeup earlier this month
not only is this absolutely disgusting
it also shines light on the booming
counterfeit makeup business authorities
seized 700 thousand dollars worth of
counterfeit products during a raid in
the fashion district of LA targeting 21
locations in the
the alley shopping area after the piracy
unit of the LAPD received several
complaints about cosmetics causing skin
rashes wonder why in the Federal Bureau
of Investigation's and Central Bureau
Vice units assisted in the raid in a
tweet after the raid LAPD captain mark
arena warned customers looking for a
bargain that quote the best price is not
always the best deal the counterfeit
Cosmetics included imitations of popular
brands like Kylie Anastasio Mac Urban
Decay Naked and Too Faced what are we
always saying if the price seems too
good to be true it's probably full of
crap the nonprofit organization girls
who code a group dedicated to closing
the gender gap in technology has teamed
with covergirl cosmetics in a campaign
to increase inclusivity of women in STEM
fields computer science is one of the
fastest growing careers in the country
but so few women are part of the field
girls who code offer different programs
for girls in elementary school through
high school to learn how to code and
encourage them to further their learning
in college currently only one in every
five computer science graduates is a
woman and only 24% of computer
scientists are women and unbelievably
the number decreases decreases every
year girls who code is active in
changing those statistics and have had
90 thousand girls enroll with a majority
of girls making computer science their
career after graduating college with the
help of covergirl they'll be reaching a
wider audience of girls who didn't
realize they too could code the girls
who code campaign will feature an ad
starring three younger female coders and
spotlights the brands that clean a matte
collection covergirl will also be
donating $50,000 to girls who code and
finally we applaud CoverGirl's effort
but
yes it's time again for this week at
Harris Teeter our intrepid community
member decided to extend her search to
the covergirl section now take a look at
these foundations they look perfectly
okay right wrong
comparing the batches to a Czech
cosmetics net info shows that some of
the foundations were manufactured in
