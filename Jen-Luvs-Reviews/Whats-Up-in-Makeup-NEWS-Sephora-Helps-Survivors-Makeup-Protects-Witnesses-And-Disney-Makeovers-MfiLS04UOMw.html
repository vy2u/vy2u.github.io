slow down movement here to California

rituals USA we feel very welcomed here
already and are thrilled to be
connecting our brand footprint with an
ever-expanding audience and speaking of
slow down movements
as befits holiday weekend responses to
our inquiries about expired Revlon
foundations at Harris Teeter have been
very slow we've received one response
from Kody parent company of covergirl
about the peacock flair mascara that we
talked about last week as follows thank
you for taking the time to contact
covergirl we just wanted to let you know
that our peacock Clair mascara just came
out in September of 2017 there is no way
that the product was produced in 2009
well yes we know the question
incidentally was whether or not product
codes were ever reused or recycled but
we will try again people use those codes
to check expiration dates in apps
available to see if cosmetics are
expired we also received this from a
viewer named Marissa
I just watched yesterday's news video
and wanted to let you know about some
interesting information I discovered
about an English Elle eyeliner I
purchased from camera-ready cosmetics
I've only ever purchased one of these
black gel eyeliners and did so in
December of 2017 upon checking the
manufacturer date of this product check
cosmetics net said that the date of
manufacturer was April of 2018 which
obviously isn't true
our queries to the software developers
also go unanswered so far we're also
attempting to track down the vendor who
allegedly handles the cosmetic aisle at
the Harris Teeter in Delaware where all
of this began some of us are skeptical
that this vendor even exists but
regardless here's this week's new crew a
different Revlon badly separated
covergirl starting to separate some
Maybelline also to separate and document
it as old and the group we've started to
think of as the usual suspects
sometimes this story is like that of the
Vikings and beekeepers who could only
set sail east by day and west by night

had the whole scoop but now it seems the
Ulta versus Carol story has come to a
bitter end if you haven't heard this one
in late April YouTube celebs and went to
Ulta with his crew and when the employee
Carol asked for a selfie the team said
only if she gave Morgan a Texas makeover
the video was uploaded on May 2nd and
featured Morgan receiving a face of
makeup and a hairdo that dotson is
calling me $10,000 makeover as a result
the employee Carol allegedly ran into
hot water with Ulta Carol posted a photo
on Instagram saying she lost her job as
a result of the video
Dawson took to Twitter calling out Ulta
for seemingly firing someone for helping
out several influencers voiced their
opposition to Ulta alleged decision Ulta
insisted to Shane and the Twitterverse
that carol was not fired a
representative told at Teen Vogue she
has not been let go we do realize we
could have done a better job
communicating with her about the
situation we have given her some time
off with pay to decide if she wants to
return and we hope she does after
several days of deliberation Carol
decided to officially leave her position
at Ulta sang on Instagram she wished the
situation was handled better by the
company now moving back to makeup
releases does seÃ±or look familiar it's
the star of the Dior cruise 20:19 show
