Sephora's new policy might make you
curse and for Claire's it's just getting
worse I'm Jen from Jen Lowe's reviews
and what's been makeup starts now
welcome to what's up and makeup for
March 18th 2018 let's get started with
the top industry news research teams
across multiple labs are working on
validating models and methods that could
replace animal testing for skin exposure
a combination of tests were performed on
two artificial skin models to see if
they match results of known in vitro
tests or tests that don't involve living
cells 100% matching test results were
found in four out of five labs with 70%
matching test results in the fifth
further validation across other test
methods chemicals and laboratories are
key for the models to make an impact on
regulations validation process is
ongoing but is promising for a
cruelty-free future in the beauty
industry Beauty by pop sugar has arrived
after over 18 months of planning and
research after taking input from the
PopSugar community the a gigantic poll
the company developed a multifunctional
cruelty free products which contain
ingredients inspired by vacation
destinations
each has accompanying inspirational
messages on the packaging the PopSugar
team is careful to represent their motto
quote no bad stuff Lisa sugar founder
and president expressed the importance
of maintaining their mission and doing
right by fans stating quote inclusion is
a cornerstone of pop sugar across the
board from our content to our staff and
now to our makeup line pop sugar is for
everyone we want people who engage with
us to feel welcome and to know that we
are thinking of them and the same is
definitely true with our makeup you can
purchase Beauty by pop sugar products on
beauty by pop sugar calm as well as at
Ulta online and in select stores the
next time you need to buy stocking
stuffers you may not be able to get them
from Claire's the mall jewelry beauty
and gift store is rumoured to be poised
for bankruptcy to make matters worse
they continue to deny the presence of
asbestos in their cosmetic products
even after new research by nonprofit US
Public Interest Research Group revealed
15 current products contained the
harmful substance Clair's is reportedly
struggling with failing mall locations
increased online competition and a high
debt load some rumors suggest the
company may try to reinvent themselves
but the jury's still out a parents of
four employees have brought a collective
action lawsuit against the company
requesting compensation for time spent
upholding Sephora's makeup code of
conduct the filing states quote Sephora
required application of a minimum amount
of makeup and the maintenance of that
makeup throughout the day without
compensation for the time spent doing so
the employees claim that because of this
makeup requirement Sephora did not
provide employees with the wages to
which they were entitled Sephora
recently revised their employee handbook
to state their makeup code of conduct is
optional but adherents and restrictions
vary by store the request for
certification was granted meaning any
Sephora employee who qualifies could be
remunerated as long as all parties
agreed to the terms when wild could be
under fire for falsely labeling a
product as vegan photos have surfaced on
social media showing their mega last
time-saving basecoat nail polish with
packing indicating the product as vegan
but containing silk powder as ingredient
no word yet as if this was a misprint on
the packaging or if the labeling was
intentional but the ingredient is also
listed online be sure to check
ingredients when deciding on the vegan
and cruelty-free status of your purchase
companies that are known for their
generous return policies are now
thinking twice about being so
accommodating a service company called
the retail equation is partnering with
companies including Sephora to help
identify customers who could be taking
advantage of return policies so for
shoppers have reported on social media
that they've received an email banning
them from returns or were denied for
making returns in-store due to what
Sephora calls a high return activity
when asked for a statement by ract the
representative from Sephora noted we
make every effort to accommodate returns
but a small fraction of customers take
advantage of our policy and
cases returning more than twice as much
return merchandise as they purchase this
limits production selection and unfairly
impacts other clients do you think these
changes will impact shopper experiences
let us know in the comments world famous
professional tennis player Serena
Williams is setting her eyes on Rihanna
and Kylie Jenner for her next big match
I'll explain
Serena filed legal documents in January
to trademark anarres which is Serena
spelled backwards for a teen beauty

rinses hair spray and gel cosmetic cases
and makeup brushes Serena already
trademark anarres in 2016 for fashion
related goods including clothing george
Sevier principal associate at gowling
wlg law firm said quote using an res
rather than sarena is a sound move apart
from avoiding issues with other
businesses already using the name it
allows Serena Williams to sell the
rights to the brand without being
prevented from using her own name in the
future there's more makeup equal bad
leadership skills according to a study
led by dr. Christopher Watkins of a
burden of psychology published this
month in perception journal women
wearing heavy makeup are less likely to
be thought of as good leaders random
pairs of photos of women who were
wearing a social event makeup subtle
makeup or wear makeup free were
evaluated by judges 186 male and female
participants to determine who they
thought would be a better leader the
study found that regardless of race or
age of the judge and the woman
photographed the faces without makeup
were always perceived as being better
leaders than those with social event
makeup the woman's face had the amount
of makeup applied altered by the
computer software those with subtle
makeup had slightly better scores but
were still ranked negatively against
those free of makeup the study
demonstrated the effect of color cues in
makeup aka color cosmetics but stated
that products that don't make a color
impact such as foundation mascara or
concealer may not have a large effect in
contrast a 2016 Harvard University
Research
I found that women wearing makeup were
viewed as more competent at their jobs
and more likely to receive a promotion
have you found that you've been treated
differently at work due to your makeup
