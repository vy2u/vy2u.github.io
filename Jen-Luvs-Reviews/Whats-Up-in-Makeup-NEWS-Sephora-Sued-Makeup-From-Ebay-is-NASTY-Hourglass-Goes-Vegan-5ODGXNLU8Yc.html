dangers of shopping for makeup on eBay
and can you really catch an STD from a
tester I'm Jen from Jen Lowe's reviews
and what's up and makeup starts now
welcome to what's up in makeup for
November 5th 2017 let's get started with
the top industry news Hourglass
Cosmetics announced that it is going
fully vegan and that it will revamp its
ingredients list by 2020 the brand
already sells predominantly vegan
products that are not tested on animals
but plans are to eliminate animal
derived ingredients including beeswax
lanolin and carmine they're asking
experts in biotech to find new
ingredients that don't sacrifice quality
the price range of $18 to $350 will not
change as the brand evolves hourglass
will sell a limited edition vegan
leather makeup bag online contributing
all of the profits to animal rights a
recent report by market research future
expects cruelty-free products to grow
about 6.1 percent by 2023 Google's
latest report on skincare trends found
that searches for vegan products have
grown 83 percent year over year since
2010 Shiseido has announced it will
close nearly half of the 209
bareMinerals stores in the US according
to WWD launched in 1995 the bareMinerals
parent company bare essentials was
acquired by Shiseido in 2010 famous for
its mineral foundation the brand has
struggled in recent years in an
increasingly more competitive market the
company claims that a full 30% of
American women used the brand Shiseido
affirms that it will continue to invest
in the brand
in contrast the Estee Lauder companies
issued a forecast of holiday quarter
sales well ahead of market expectations
apparently thanks to those acquisitions
of brands aimed at attracting
Millennials such as Too Faced aunt Becca
the company also credits having signed
on influencers and celebrities to
promote its products the strong forecast
followed better than expected sales and
profit in the first quarter
as sales in the asia-pacific region and
Europe soared quote we benefited from a
continued acceleration in China Hong
Kong travel retail and global online
chief executive Fabrizio Freitas said in
the United States though
brick-and-mortar sales have been falling
the company's greater use of cosmetic
retailers Ulta and Sephora have helped
it offset any hits to profits Disney
fans we know you've been waiting for
this one the Besame cosmetics no wait
1937 collection launches this month
you know Besame for their throwback
style and classic formulas Snow White's
creamy skin and dark Rouge lips are a
hallmark of vintage makeup looks the
colors in the collection are based on
the original Disney cell and background
colors specifically created for the film
all universally flattering for a
polished look here are the highlights
the 1937 storybook palette is $68 with
20 shadows with a smile and a song cream
Rouge is $20 or with a smile and a song
eyes shadow palette $43 in two colorways
classic color lipsticks $24 those come
in four shades Seven Dwarfs mini
lipsticks at $35 snow-white travel back
$35 or book motif makeup bag $15 the
fairest vanity mirror is $40 and more
the collection will arrive at best
amazed flagship store in Burbank
California and will also be available
online at Besame ModCloth and sephora as
well as the Disney Family museum in San
Francisco but if you prefer your
princesses more on the modern side Mally
beauty's new frozen makeup collection
just launched on QVC this holiday line
features shadows liners mascaras lip
glosses and blushes into gorgeously
packaged kits one for Elsa and one for
Anna 4998 each there's plenty of makeup
that claims to give you a glow to the
heavens but what about glow in the dark
some brands are taking that idea to a
level that requires you to turn off the
lights but safety questions are popping
up about these highlighters the FDA
which only test the color additives used
has pinpointed a luminescent zinc
sulfide as the
only fda-approved compound used to
create the glow-in-the-dark effect while
it can be used on skin it should not be
used every day and nowhere near the eyes
experts recommend you perform a patch
test and not hesitate to remove the
product if there is any redness burning
or stinging and it's not only about
putting it on it's how you take it off
check the labels for any removal
instructions be extra careful around
your eyes and then use both an oil based
cleanser followed by a foaming cleanser
to completely remove the chemicals
that's a lot just for a few hours at
glowing in the dark reporters at Florida
as NBC 2 news recently wanted the answer
to the question are counterfeit
cosmetics really harmful to humans and
you will not like what they found the
products in question came from settlers
on ebay and claim to be discounted
versions of designer products the
products arrived in small black bags
labeled clothing suspicious the news
team then brought them to Princeton
Consumer Research in st. Petersburg for
analysis where differences in color
application and texture were noted they
were then sent to that company's labs in
the UK where the real trouble started
all of the counterfeit products
contained quote significant quantities
of lead and aluminum traces along with
rat droppings yes they contained rat
droppings one fake also had traces of
mercury very Drouet PC our technical
director noted quote the biggest problem
is banned substances can penetrate
through the skin and go into the
bloodstream the last thing we want is
for someone to become ill because of a
fake product for example lead poisoning
can cause memory loss muscle pains and
headaches aluminum can accumulate in the
brain and tissues causing memory loss
and dementia over a period of time
exposure to mercury and eye makeup can
damage your vision permanently as well
as damage to the heart kidney lungs and
brain bacteria invested fake makeup can
lead to serious skin rashes and as for
rat droppings among other things the
just cross so yeah when you see a modern
renaissance palette for $5.00 on eBay
you might want to skip it this week we
heard TMZ reported that a woman in
California is suing Sephora after
claiming a tester from the store gave
her herpes in quote exact alignment with
a 2015 visit this was later diagnosed by
a doctor as oral herpes the unnamed
customer bases her claim on never having
had a cold sore or herpes prior to the
visit she's suing the chain for strict
liability negligence intentional
infliction of emotional distress and
negligent infliction of emotional
distress and believes the company should
have warned customers about the risk of
contracting and infection according to
the CDC oral herpes is most usually
caused by hsv-1 and may result in fever
blisters or cold sores in or around the
mouth but can you catch it from a tester
to quote an article in popular science
calm down herpes is primarily spread via
skin-to-skin contact or saliva if
someone with HSV is experiencing
symptoms like cold sores they go through
quote viral shedding which is just what
it sounds like
according to the article herpes can't
survive long outside of the body but
it's technically possible that it could
hold on just long enough to infect a new
host if two people use the same lip
stick in a very quick succession
especially if the second user had open
wounds on their lips think chapped lips
it's a horrifying prospect but how
horrified should you really be again the
article cites a 2015 study by the World
Health Organization which found that two
out of three people under the age of 50
have HSV one aka oral herpes plus some
90% of people who are diagnosed with
herpes by way of blood tests have never
had symptoms and had no idea they had it
which brings us back to product hygiene
many stores have their policies and
spritzers but even if they mounted huge
flashing signs or programmed robots to
remind customers about best practices
you must remember this ultimately the
responsibility is on you do
nah apply the contents of any testers
directly to any area of your face even
if it is brand new completely pristine
and free of bacteria and viruses
you look contaminate it with your own so
be a good human and think of the next
person we don't know what will happen
with this lawsuit and we'll keep you
posted of what changes it may bring
until then protect yourself but there
are good things going on at Sephora as
well their holiday reached out in gift
campaign which encourages people to
connect with others through Beauty gifts
includes a diverse group of their own
employees over 1,000 cast members apply
to be a part of the campaign with a
video talking about what Beauty means to
them and ten were selected from across
the US and Canada for the campaign based
upon celebrating different perspectives
