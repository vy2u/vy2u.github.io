honest company answers some questions
and there's no question about this trend
I'm Jen from Jenn Moser news and what
the van makeup starts now welcome to
what have been makeup for july 9th 2017
let's get started with our top industry
news we've all been there that moment
when you're staring at one of your
favorite products and debating whether
or not it's too old to use the guideline
says it is expired but do you toss it or
take the chance i small at-home
experiment conducted by reddit user
semicolon underscore expected might give
you some insight the user tried out two
expired products of five year old
mascara and a year old lipstick she
swapped each product into a petri dish
and left them to sit for three days with
no incubation each plate grew large
colonies of yellow and white bacteria
the findings are not surprising at all
if you consider anything about the areas
of the face that these products are
intended for the eyes and lips now that
you know this do these findings solidify
the idea that you should discard your
products according to guidelines or are
you still not convinced comment below
with your view in a world where it seems
like everyone's trying to find a new way
to bring their views to light why not
put your support where your mouth is if
you agree with this cause that is that's
exactly what lipstick Lobby and opening
ceremony had in mind with this latest
product kiss my pink is a punchy matte
pink lipstick that will help you as they
put it
hashtag lipstick it to the man the
lipstick Lobby states on its website
wearing this lipstick is a reminder that
small actions can create big waves it's
a small thing we can all do right here
right now to create change 100% of the
profits from the $19 tube will be
donated directly to the Women's Health
Initiative at Planned Parenthood
speaking of lipsticks here's another way
to make a statement as you can imagine
creating a lipstick with a punch can be
an overwhelming task especially when you
get into brighter colors with that in
mind try creating a neon lipstick that
also follows
green standards mission impossible not
provide an easy amuse-bouche nearly
neons lipstick collection launched this
past week and Valley well away these are
true
neons the limited-edition shade range
covers the standards like pink fuchsia
and Peach as well as some edgy air
shades like purple orange and blue by
beauty founder Suzanne Langer stated
it's extremely tough to formulate with
natural and food grade ingredients but
is made in-house and we never outsource
formulating or producing our lipsticks
she went on to add for nearly neons
a base of organic castor seed oil is
triple milled with a blend of iron
oxides food grade pigments and dnc
colorants it's not possible to create
bright Pink's exclusively with organic
colorant as they're not approved by the
FDA for use in lipstick it's always
about balance the rest of the
ingredients list includes a base similar
to bite Beauty the news bouche line a
mix of hydrating organic oils
moisturizing butters and antioxidants
entirely free of parabens sulfates
petrochemicals and Bay lates
and to create that comfortable glide on
the list Suzanne turns to silicone
alternatives like jojoba available now
at Sephora $26 each this is a trend
that's getting more noticeable a
so-called limited-edition limited
quantity or just hot new product
launches and sells out immediately
moments later the company pops back up
to announce the upcoming restock so is
it missed the item are happy but more
and more often the sell out / restock
cycle is making customers IVA skeptical
after all doesn't it take a while to
manufacture more of those items the
answer is yes of course here's the
rundown for most products the
manufacture cycle takes upwards of 6
weeks and that's that there's no
precious ingredients that are too rare
to keep on hand those alone can add up
to eight more weeks to the cycle for a
total of fourteen weeks even if you
start taking pre-orders it can take
longer than some companies are taking to
announce the surprise restock it's that
type of tactic that Marlena stell owner
of makeup D question in a recent post on
Twitter Marlena stated I'm always
curious when restocks mysteriously
happen in a week or two production takes
them
minimum of six weeks and that's where
the customer skepticism comes in with
previously mentioned timelines it does
make one wonder exactly what these
companies are up to doesn't take Nancy
Drita deduce that the company may have
already had ample stock on hand for the
original launch and it never really was
sold out in the first place my question
to you is does a false sold outside make
you not want to buy or are you just
happy to get your hands on the product
no matter how it's marketed I love them
they're your thoughts in the comments
below
CVX why creator viewer experience live
is an annual convention held to allow
media creators and viewers to come
together with attendance that has grown
every year since 2015 each year
thousands of creators submit content in
order to be considered for the next big
youtuber contest this year we are so
proud to announce that one of our very
own collective brain of makeup
awesomeness members Orly Campbell has
been selected as one of the top 100
finalists for the award voting to help
Orly take the crown as the next big
youtuber will begin tomorrow July 10th
congratulate on placing in the top 100
best of luck to you my friend the honest
company is known for using marketing
terms such as no harsh chemicals and
natural but a proposed class-action suit
holds the brand accountable for using
such terms fraudulently according to a
report published by Reuters the suit was
filed two weeks ago in Manhattan and is
currently pending approval by a judge
the company owned by Jessica Alba has
set aside a 7.3 5 million dollar fund
for the plaintiff the company which
denies wrongdoing has however pledged to
adjust its labeling practices quote this
settlement in no way changes the fact
that our marketing practices are
entirely appropriate and we will
continue to market products as natural
so the company in a statement get on
snapchat blow a kiss to the camera and
change your hair color L'Oreal Paris UK
has partnered with snapchat to launch a
custom lens that does just that the lens
was designed to promote the brand's
colour ISA hair and makeup range
launched last week it was available for
24 hours via the snapchat lens carousel
and is unlockable for 90 days you
an exclusive snapcode which is only
available at L'Oreal color East
promotional events speaking at L'Oreal
they've joined forces with Google to
launch the medium def initiative which
is sorting through consumer data in
order to create six-second
advertisements for video the partnership
was formed when data revealed that
customers are less willing to engage
with lengthy ads and in fact respond
well to shorter marketing teasers that
are more catchy and will keep their
attention Media best initiative is set
to be the first level of collaboration
in this category a campaign promoting
Unilever's baby dub line seems to have
taken a wrong turn along the way among
that emotional tools is a high profile
advertising campaign which bears the
message seventy-five percent say
breastfeeding in public is fine
twenty-five percent say put them away
what's your way the blow back arrived
soon after when consumers influencers
and health organizations objected to the
brand's support for those that believe
that breastfeeding in public is wrong
among men was baby milk action which
posted on their Facebook that quote it
is illegal to discriminate against
anyone for how they feed their child in
public a very long time ago in what's up
and makeup we talked about the Walgreens
booths alliance to buy Rite Aid they
have now called off the planned merger
after failing to gain regulatory
approval instead they have announced a
plan to purchase almost half of Rite
Aid's Us stores for 5.18 billion dollars
the deal is expected to close in the
next six months and you probably have a
lip balm in your pocket or purse but you
never gave a thought to your beauty care
down there the V magic feminine lipstick
offers gentle moisture to your other
lips the all-natural ingredients
including some organic food grade
ingredients like olive oil and honey are
gentle to sensitive areas $18 at their
website man we're all talking about the
body parts this week take a look at shan
EXO sneak peak of a new brush line the
nipple brushes yes that's what they're
called and they do live up to their
names as the average thank you little
nipple right on up the nipple said to
