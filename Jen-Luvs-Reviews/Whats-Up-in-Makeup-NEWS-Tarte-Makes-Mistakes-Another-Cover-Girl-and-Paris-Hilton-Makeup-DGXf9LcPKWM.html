covergirl has ties the space exploration
and Paris Hilton may have the next
makeup sensation I'm Jen from Jen Lowe's
reviews and what's fin makeup starts now
welcome to what's a bit make up for
October 1st 2017 let's get started with
the top industry news did you know that
Paris Hilton has had a cosmetic line for
two years if you did not you are not
alone Paris Hilton Cosmetics has a small
almost underground cultish following
with those who know the products
swearing by their quality but where are
they not in the stores you're probably
accustomed to shopping the Sephora and
altas and nada department stores in fact
those looking for the line have been
hopping from discount store at a
discount store to seek out that treasure
trove but according to insiders the line
may be making a move into big-box stores
the celebrity recently took to Instagram
to display a wide range of cosmetics on
her desk with the hashtag girl boss so
where is it we don't know how much is it
we don't know that either if you know
let us know in the comments below and we
have a contender in the Battle of the
glitter face masks
Joyce Benelli a makeup artist widely
known for inspiring Kim Kardashian's
bleach blonde look back in 2015 has
announced she will be releasing a bling
face mask that's fit for royalty the
announcement was made on Bonelli's
instagram page via a photo of her
wearing a giant diamond ring diamond
bracelet and that mask the caption
states yes it's real and I'm not only
talking about the ring could the mass be
made of or at least contains some form
of diamonds who can blame makeup lovers
for getting excited over shimmers and
glitters we can only imagine that this
could be one luxury price masked
diamonds may be a
girl's best friend but they sure are not
a friend to the wallet more information
as it becomes available
over the past couple of weeks tarte
cosmetics has been out of the frying pan
into the fire and back into the pan last
week the company saw blowback from a
distasteful meme posted to their
Instagram page
there among discussion of potatoes and
tomatoes was a phrase many Asian
customers found offensive tart removed
the post blamed an unspecified intern
and issued an apology this did not seem
to please their followers overall as
they were then reprimanded for not
apologizing directly to their Asian
customers and followers shortly after
that a second apology directly from CEO
Maureen Kelly appeared just when things
were seeming to die down customers
started receiving receiving order
confirmations from the company that
we're not there's some reported
receiving 50 or more emails all alike
but with different names on them each
email contained the customers name
shipping and mailing address and email
address even worse if the receiving
party clicked on the link within the
email they were sent directly to tarts
website where they then had direct
access to the person's phone number and
the last four digits of the credit cards
used for the purchase when customer
service was asked what they were doing
to correct the situation those who asked
were told delete the email those who
pressed further on social media received
what appeared to be a macro response
last Friday tarte gave a statement to
revel in which they said there has been
a lot of misinformation on social media
and we want to set the record straight
last weekend we experienced an issue
with our shipment notification email
tool that affected 1,400 orders as a
result of this issue some of our
customers received multiple copies of
shipping information other than their
own we want to assure our customers that
no information was disclosed that would
expose them to a heightened risk of
identity theft or similar harm this item
in revel us went on to say that
effective customers received a full
refund and that tart would also be
setting them new holiday items for the
inconvenience however there has still
been no official statement from the
company on any of their social media
outlets
we'll follow the story as it develops
back in May we were
on Forever 21's plans to open a limited
number of freestanding cosmetic stores
across the country called Riley Rose the
first store has now opened in Glendale
California the stores termed as
experimental spaces focused on
accessories cosmetics and home goods for
the Millennial consumer will carry a
wide variety of go to standards and hard
to find cult classics that range from $2
to 189 dollars the short main focus will
still be in D and K beauty brands but
you will be able to grab some of your
fave items from laura geller Stila tony
moly and SE now you're asking what will
the stores look like thanks to a sneak
peak offered by pop sugar we now know
the Riley Rose stores will look a bit
like our childhood dollhouse with a tech
twist the products will be displayed on
vanities instead of on tables and
customers can get makeup advice via
interactive touch screens if you can't
wait for a store to open in your area
three more are set to open in 2018
you can shop Oh Riley Rose online
starting in November another new face
for covergirl has been announced joining
the team this time around is the
stunning may musk at 69 years young with
decades as a model she's still gracing
the runways of countless shows and is
sure to open a brand new market for the
brand with wearing makeup a part of my
job as a model one might think I'd get
tired of it but I absolutely love it she
commented it's a fascinating process you
start out as a blank canvas and then a
transformation occurs but there's always
a very real and honest piece of me there
- musk says Okinawa Ojo SVP of cover
girls stated May is an affirmation of
the power and importance and diversity
and inclusivity in the world of beauty
she is unstoppable and together we're
just getting started
but she's not just a gorgeous face may

brush options such as a three-block
brush set that slides apart for use and
fits together for travel
they were also Styles developed purely
for their decorative appeal like a brush
with three distinct Tufts that form a
heart there's no doubt that there's a
shade range dilemma in the cosmetic
industry and while some companies have
taken step forwards in creating more
shades for everybody think mac makeup

song we're all out of your shade well
between the time we film this show and

Molly's employer requested that she take
the video down and a prepared statement

pressure right now due to the lack of
stock of the Fanta products the video
was removed for publicity reasons and
the fear that it would exacerbate the
issue I would like to state as a cast

realize that support is the middleman in
this situation and to please be patient
