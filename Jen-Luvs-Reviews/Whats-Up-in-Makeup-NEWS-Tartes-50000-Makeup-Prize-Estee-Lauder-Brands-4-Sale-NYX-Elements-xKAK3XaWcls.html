let's get started with the top industry
news are the Estee Lauder companies up

acquisition is making fans of the
company's wide range of holdings very
nervous rumors have been flying this
past week with various reports naming
potential suitors as L'Oreal Procter &amp;amp;
Gamble Colgate Palmolive and Unilever
wagers are being placed Bloomberg's
money is on Unilever and Nasdaq is
betting on L'Oreal as the consumers we
just want to be sure the quality of the
products would remain the same now
fast-forward to one day later and
Bloomberg News has obtained an internal
memo in which executive chairman William
Lauder and chief executive officer of
Fabrizio Freda said to employees the
Estee Lauder company is not for sale
adding that the company and the board
place quote great value in remaining
independent and the company is quote
strong and we have excellent momentum
going forward more details as they

the line most of us know for their
amazing prices has announced that they
will be launching one brand new product
every single day throughout the month of
September what more could you ask for
the excitement of a new item each day
plus prices that won't make your wallet
run for the hills comment below with
what you'd like to see in the month-long
surprise launches seems like we have one
of these stories almost every week
people of color having a difficult time
securing a shade match for many items
foundations new lippies the list goes on
but now this has revealed a recent study
in which 75% of beauty products marketed
to black women do in fact have
potentially hazardous ingredients in
them compared to those that are marketed
to white women
the most toxic of the products were hair
relaxers bleaching products and hair
color safety organizations have been and
are still pushing for safer alternatives
in the beauty community for women of
color in a world of technological
advances it's time for safe products for
all can a sticker save your selfie pics
out says yes the company which has
recently appeared in Sephora's beauty on
the fly area offers zip fighting
stickers drenched in vitamin A salicylic
acid and aloe vera so unique they are
now patented the stickers of the
brainchild of 26 year old and Rico
Fraser himself a former resident of zit
City he says the main difference from
other companies is that we are real
people creating the products we
understand what it feels like to have
skin imperfections and we are on a
mission to address them with effective
products that work superfast
20 anti acne stickers are 19 dollars at
Sephora and finally let's talk about a
couple of trends that are hot right now
the first one is wiggle brows aka wavy
brows at first glance your impression
might be why but they seem to be the
thing for these back to campus retro
disco kid quasi dystopian times I mean
how Hunger Games are they if you're
thinking of wearing them for a job
interview you might want to reconsider
but for a night out why not
they're squidward approved the second
trend comes with a warning
glitter tongue is making the rounds
right now on Instagram and many medical
professionals caution you do not use
regular craft glitter for this most
craft glitter is made of plastic and
really doesn't belong anyone near
anywhere near your face much less inside
your body it can cause digestive
problems if swallowed illness if
bacteria Ladin or if it's glass glitter
much much worse there are however a
double glitters used for cake decor
which are made of food based ingredients
such as colored sugar those are fine so
use those for your photos just be
careful and we still wouldn't recommend
you wear this to your job interview in
