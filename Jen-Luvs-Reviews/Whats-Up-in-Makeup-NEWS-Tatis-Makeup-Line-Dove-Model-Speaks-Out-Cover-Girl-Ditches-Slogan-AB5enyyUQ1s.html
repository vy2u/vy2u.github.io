you recognize this woman
and what's the true name of this school
I'm Jen from Jen loves reviews and
what's been makeup starts now welcome to
what's up and makeup for october 15 2017
let's get started with the top industry
news for the past two weeks we've
reported on covergirl announcing many
new faces for the brand and wondered
what are they up to well now we know
easy breezy beautiful covergirl has been
the brand's iconic slogan for decades
but this week it's run has come to an
end
okano jo senior vice president of
covergirl said about their consumers the
more we listen to her talk about her
beauty her self-identity she's becoming
a lot more comfortable in her own skin
and in her ability to create who she is
and makeup is a significant part of that
self-expression and with that in mind
the company announced its new slogan I
am what I makeup I'll let you
contemplate that for a moment
no it's not a misquote of Rene Descartes
it's from a quote by Toni Morrison
what's the world for you if you can't
make it up the way you want to get off
their new campaign they also released a
short film online featuring six of the
brand's new faces along with the change
in slogan the brand is also overhauling
their packaging digital branding and
in-store experience for their customers
but that's not the only new buzz with
new faces this week when Wilde has
launched their campaign this week and
one of the faces 27 year old Diandra
Forrest Ari has a pretty impressive
portfolio she's been on the cover of
Ebony magazine and has walked in New
York Fashion Week
in addition to being gorgeous she is
also an albinism awareness activist has
the title of the campaign breaking
Beauty a celebration of inclusivity
which aims the spotlight directly at
fiscal attributes that the models have
previously been told to hide forest goal
has always been to debunk the
classification in the modeling world
that people with albinism were
otherworldly or mythical it was that
which drove her to one goal quote to
normalized what Alban is
was being depicted as I wanted to do it
for myself
and young girls growing up other faces
in the campaign include mama Cox a
cancer survivor and amputee activist
Valentina Hien a DJ writer and
transgender model Michele zhannar and
Asian American musician and Brianna
Marquez and Olympic weightlifter well
done went wild and congrats to all the
new faces here's to accepting beauty of
all kinds last weekend the buzz was
largely about a Facebook ad from dove
which showed a black woman shedding her
tea to become a white woman in the
extended version that woman also sheds
her skin to turn into a medium skin
toned person has some pointed out this
is the third item from the company that
has stirred racially insensitive
controversy now one of the models in
this ad has spoken out Lola Agana me and
an opinion piece for The Guardian
insists that she is no victim having the
opportunity to represent my dark-skinned
sisters in a global beauty brand felt
like the perfect way to freak for me to
remind the world that we are here we are
beautiful and more importantly we are
valued she wrote on the day the ad was
film she said that the concept was
understood by all of the models the
experience I had with the Dove team was
positive I had an amazing time on set
all of the women in the shoot understood
the concept and overarching objective to
use our differences to highlight the
fact that all skin deserves gentleness
wrote Lola I remember all of us being
excited at the idea of wearing new
t-shirts and turning into one another we
weren't sure how the final edit was
going to look nor which of us would
actually be featured in it but everyone
seemed to be in great spirits during
filming including me however once the ad
hit Facebook the controversy began quote
I woke up to a message from a friend
asking if the woman in a post he'd seen
was really me Lola wrote I went online
and discovered I had become the
unwitting poster child for racist
advertising and she understands how
people took offense I can see how the
snapshots that are circulating the web
have been misinterpreted considering the
fact that dove has faced a backlash in
the past for the exact same issue Lola
said there is a lack of trust here and I
feel the public was justified in their
initial outrage
and while some might point to Lola as
the victim of a campaign perceived as
racist she was actually quite proud of
her work I am NOT just some silent
victim of a mistaken beauty campaign
Lola writes I am strong I am beautiful
and I will not be erased while I agree
with doves response to unequivocally
apologize for any offence caused they
could have also defended their creative
vision and their choice to include me
and unequivocally dark-skinned black
woman as the face of their campaign the
hutt group has announced their
acquisition of award-winning prestige
beauty brand Illamasqua founded in 2008
by Julian Kynaston on Illamasqua is
known for its professional great
products quote we have been working with
thg for over a year now and have seen
great successes so this move was a
natural step for the brand Coniston said
Matthew molding founder and chief
executive officer of the Hutt group
stated quote we are confident that with
our world-class ecommerce platform and
large marketing infrastructure we will
deliver significant growth and further
extend Illamasqua global customer base
the Hutt group is Europe's largest

gorgeous and glossy box news of a collab
between Maybelline and Gigi Hadid hit
the net hard last week an excitement of
finally seeing the fruits of the nearly
two year planning phase but neither
party gave any details most people
assume that the palette would be solely
eyeshadow but the surprise factor was
amplified as a video was posted showing
Hadid dipping into the palette and then
padding her lips now the wait is over
and the palette has dropped sooner than
anyone thought the jetsetter palette
arrived on Friday the 13th to boots UK

Beauty bakery website is offering free

to bring your attention to a recent post
by Beauty truth sleuths about a
subscription box called Beauty
overstocks which apparently sells
counterfeit products one question they
freely admit that the products are quote
a mix of both most are authentic though
end quote
the sleuth then showed photos of
products with sketchy packaging we
definitely urge you to avoid this
company as you never know what is inside
replicas / counterfeit / fake products
and the ingredients are sometimes
harmful buyer beware and another company
suffering from fake knockoff syndrome is
luv Lux Beauty which has discovered
fakes of their fantasy palette on
Mercury eBay and Aliexpress they posted
this guide on their Instagram they're
not even the same shades what in the
world again buyer beware but here's
something real be it cosmetics love is
the foundation heart-shaped brush is now
at Ulta and for each one shouldering off
two or one will be donated to look good
feel better
finally one correction to an earlier
news story since filming this episode
new day
