Lowe's reviews and whatsapp and makeup
starts now
welcome to what's it been makeup for
October 22nd 2017 let's get started with
the top industry news YouTube star
Alissa Ashley who has nearly eight
hundred thousand followers is launching
a lipgloss with elf
I chose this color because it's one that
anyone could wear she said in fact it
might remind you of the Fanta beauty
gloss balm but it's only six dollars
launching October 24th and that leads us
into what some are calling the makeup
minimalist movement and beauty shoppers
are moving away from the matte liquid
lipsticks and lip kits and getting
reacquainted with their old friend lip
gloss professional makeup artist
Victoria Chae commented most girls want
to focus on foundations and perfect skin
and a strong lip isn't really a request
celebrity makeup artist Kate Jane Hughes
detects a shift as well although we may
still see matte liquid lipsticks from
time to time people are slowly
transitioning into this beautiful
healthy hydrated glossed look she says
the finishing touch will be here
sometime in spring of 2018 when the Too
Faced fantasy toppers collection teased
by Jerrod Blandino should arrive the Too
Faced mystical effects lipstick
collection will include unicorn tears of
course now accompanied by angel tears
fairy tears and mermaid tears more
details we don't know him yet you know
Jared but we guess he's been busy
getting the brand new clover palette
ready this is a limited edition palette
with neutrals and brights named for
Jared's pup clover and to mark the
occasion to face is donating a quarter
million dollars to Best Friends Animal

delightful future kissed lipstick and
brass shelled blushes all instinct
classics expect alive when they hit Mac
stores November 2nd brace yourselves
we're just gonna say
it Kat Von D and Green Day are
collaborating on an eyeliner I know it
should be called basket case
after Green Day's 1994 single details
are still sparse but we have a photo of
Kat Von D handcuffed to Billie Joe
Armstrong and that will have to hold you
for now remember the 80s even if you
don't you can enjoy the work of iconic
illustrator Patrick Nagel and his strong
confident women Urban Decay is bringing
out these three vise lipstick palettes
which contain 5 shades each which will
inspire you let's hop the pond and check
out something going on in the UK L'Oreal
has collab with Cheryl Cole for three
lip kits each with a special mission one
pound from every lip kit soul will be
donated to Cheryl's trust and associated
with the prince's trust look good while
doing good the National Retail
Federation forecasts the US spending for
this Halloween will hit a record nine
point 1 billion dollars a chunk of that
can be attributed to Halloween related
makeup this halo is due in large parts
of the impact of Instagram and YouTube
influencers demonstrating their skills
with both pretty and scary looks
Halloween is becoming almost as
important as holiday says Julie Campbell
vice president of marketing at astral
health and beauty owners of pur
cosmetics done right a brand can do very
