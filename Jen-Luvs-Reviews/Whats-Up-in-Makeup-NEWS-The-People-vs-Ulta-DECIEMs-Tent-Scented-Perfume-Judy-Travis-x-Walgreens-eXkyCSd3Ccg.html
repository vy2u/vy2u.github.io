started with the top industry news as
makeup sales continue to grow brands are
facing increasing challenges a market
research report by analysis company
Tecna
revealed that the highest demand is for
natural and organic ingredients in
products while the largest challenge
lies in the growing availability of
counterfeit products the report states
that consumers are more willing to pay
for luxury products that instill
confidence in quality and performance
however this also means that
counterfeits are aiming to provide the
same look for less often with the
sacrifice to ingredients in safety to be
safe you may want to always purchase
makeup from authorized retailers and
brands to avoid fake products Canadian
Olympic gold medalist Tessa virtue has
been named the next face of Nivea Canada

an iconic brand like Nivea as an
exceptional honor I adore the products

misunderstanding between the company and
the agency when asked for comment by
cosmopolitan Oh L'Oreal representative
stated the photoshoot was
to support a new haircolor launch and
feature hairdressers and lifestyle

organic trash to do so after 18 months
of
lore'l identified a potential renewable
energy production solution by utilizing
landfill gas which is created as food
and other compostable materials
breakdown landfill gas made up of 50
percent methane is a major contributor
of greenhouse gas emissions but can be
captured and treated to create renewable
natural gas L'Oreal has signed a deal
which is expected to eliminate the
carbon equivalent of 1.8 million gallons
of gasoline consumed by the company each
year so the next time you throw out
