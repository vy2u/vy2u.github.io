cosmetics market BH founders will retain
a significant ownership stake in the
company a recent study by researchers at
the University of California San Diego
and the European molecular biology
laboratory resulted in a unique new tool
to map our skin through surface sampling
followed by a battery of molecular tests
the researchers were able to identify
cosmetic and hygiene products used on
volunteers up to three days after they
were applied they're calling the methods
and results 3d molecular cartography as
it shows a map of the substances on the
surface and one part of the study
mapping the molecules on the skin of two
volunteers resulted in prevalent traces
of sunscreen and other hygiene products
even three days after they last been
used said Heather Bushman in her
coverage of the research when paired
with these other analyses the team hopes
that these findings will aid forensics
