just forever hot I'm Jen from Jen loves
reviews and what's been makeup starts
now welcome to what's up and make up for
June 11th 2017 let's get started with
the top industry news it started with a
collie s a snack box created buzz
everywhere launched on Friday morning
and ended not too long after the Urban
Decay Naked heat palette will return to
their website on June 12th that's
tomorrow and what they're calling super
limited quantities for beauty junkies
only maybe odds be ever in your favor
full release on June 30th oops he did it
again
the king of sneaky peeks Jerrod Blandino
of two-face just sneaked an upcoming
collab with the Princess of Pop Britney
Spears in a recent Instagram post Jerrod
showed shadow shades and what looks to
be a magnetic palette as well as pots of
glitter the caption I'm a slave for you
if he simply referencing Spears this
2001 mega hit to express his feelings
for an upcoming project or is Britney
bringing her lucky energy to the
toothpaste line we'll let you know more
as the story develops after someone from
covergirl saw this sign in a subway car
and we agree that no clipping should
never be done in public they started
wondering is it just the subway or was
there a bigger issue that reaches
farther than anyone thought to find the
answer covergirl conducted a survey of
over 1500 women around the country the
results over half of those women stated
they do in fact feel uncomfortable doing
their makeup in public and who among us
has been there even a simple
reapplication lipstick can end up with
someone staring at you as if you've
offended all of society to combat this
Sigma covergirl has started project
public display of application or hashtag
project PDA they set up mirrors all over
New York City and invited 500 women to
apply their makeup in public to make a
statement
whether it is lipstick liner shadow or
blush you can apply it anywhere you want
including in public as the video says
because how when and where you makeup is
up to you so
out there doll yourself up and show your
PDA
who doesn't love having their nails done
it's a staple for many beauty lovers but
it's something of a challenge for
Muslims the Islamic practice of halal
discourages nail polish because the
polish prophets water from reaching the
nails during the cleansing in
preparation for prayers Muslim girls a
confounder Armani all hot hot bed
hopefully I didn't butcher that so that
there would be another way and has
teamed up with Orly to create challah
paint a collection of six polishes that
are made up of 100% halal certified
ingredients including vitamin C Pro
vitamin b5 and argan oil each is
permeable to water allowing it to reach
the nail along with that it has some
great names
Amani said many of us are the girls who
could never find our names on a keychain
so we wanted to make sure we provided
that experience through the collection
with that in mind
say hello to while a bro wipeout what's
the Fatima he ignore the haters and the
perfect Amana cure the collection is
limited edition but have no fear if you
miss out all of or Lee's breathable
polishes are halal certified and part of
their permanent stock let's check with
the lease of Frank and glamour dolls
evolution experience last week we had to
reveal of the single shadows as of right

floating around Jacqueline Hill people
are up in arms since the reveal of her

some quick backstory in January pix went
out of a cake that was presented to
Jacqueline during a party some people

took it as a prediction of the actual
shade in the palette
Jacqueline responded on Twitter by
stating no it has some similarities but
no and the pout you saw on a cake are
not my colors except when the pellet

familiar shades are they exactly the
