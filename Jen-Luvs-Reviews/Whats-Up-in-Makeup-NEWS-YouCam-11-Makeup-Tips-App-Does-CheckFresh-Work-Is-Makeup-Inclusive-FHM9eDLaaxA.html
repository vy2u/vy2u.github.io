makeup exploration code checkers really
give the 4 1 1 and inclusivity is for
everyone I'm Jen from Jen Lowe's reviews
and what's been makeup starts now
welcome to what's up and makeup for May
20th 2018 let's get started with the top
industry news as they approach college
Jen Z is leading the charge when it
comes to demanding inclusive
non-gendered makeup according to market
research company men tell 30% of teens
indicate that they own genderless beauty
products but what exactly are genderless
beauty products what does this actually
mean I guess for brands that are
well-established this means altered
marketing tactics and repackaging but
for startups orienting product
development with inclusivity in mind may
be a little bit easier
mainstream beauty brands market bronzers
mascara and concealers toward men
transgender and cisgendered persons by
the way for those unaware cisgender just
refers to a person who identifies as the
gender to which they were born new
brands like jeka fluid and Foreman are
leading the movement to formulate base
products that neutralize five o'clock
shadows and powders that tackle excess
oil and sweat but on the flipside not
everyone's convinced with a special
makeup line formulated for people born
male is necessary Paul Heaton is the
owner of born it's you case based makeup
and styling studio that specializes in
trans beauty and feminization he uses
the same makeup products on his
transgender clients as he would on a
cisgendered woman however he may use
them in slightly different ways so do
you feel that different lines are needed
to meet the needs of people born male or
are traditional products enough let us
know what you're thinking in the
comments below
Instagram initiated a beauty partnership
team headed by Kristy - the group will
focus on building relationship with
beauty companies to maximize marketing
capabilities increase networking within
Instagram and help the partners build
their customer base the group will also
take feedback from the partner companies
in the development of instagrams
direct-to-consumer sales and features
potentially making your next insta Hall
a little more instantaneous looking for
some personalized makeup to
vice beauty app you camp continues to
innovate cellphone experiences with the
launch of their beauty advisor one on
one service it's a group of beauty
professionals hired by the company that
are available for you to call while in
the app to get tips and instructions a
beauty advisor can then apply makeup on
themselves or on you virtually to
demonstrate their advice the service is
available from 3 to 9 p.m. Eastern time
7 days a week and only to u.s. users to
help you get ready for your night out
you cam is available for download on
Android and iPhone devices you may want
to consult your high school chemistry
teacher on the periodic table of
elements so you can get behind good
science beauty the new company utilizes
the elements and nature prominently in
their packaging and marketing products
are described precisely and often with
diagrams to help customers determine
which skincare items are best for them
most items are not yet available for
purchase but for now you can browse the
good science beauty shop at their
website wlwt's is beauty calm cody has
signed a lease for a 5-story retail site
at 30 Times Square in New York City the
company which owns covergirl among
others hints that the building would be
designed as a flagship but the main
appeal to the site is the outside with
5,800 square feet of LED billboards
which can be seen from many blocks away
in any direction which do you think it's
a bigger draw the retail space or the ad
space but giant ads like that draw you
into shop let us know in the comments
Amazon is going to make indie brands
order fulfillment a little bit easier
companies that are not currently sold at
major retailers and are at least 50%
independently owned are available for
their indeed distributor program amazon
is offering fulfillment support as well
meaning you could get indie makeup with
prime shipping we could see the lots of
new indie brands arriving at amazon as
early as June of this year some members
of the what's of the make up Facebook
community who ordered from tarts $63
promotional sale have reported trouble
with their orders dried out products
damaged products and packaging items
incorrectly fulfilled and
missing ions have been noted the
commentary begs the question does being
on sale justify lower quality or
customer service or are we simply
getting what we're paying for let us
know how you feel
lush will be closing its store front
doors and shutting down its factory in
Brazil the company blames high taxes and
low profits for its termination lush
will liquidate most items at a 50%
discount and will donate the proper
proceeds to charities as originally
intended according to the press release
lush will continue to source ingredients
directly from local brazilian
communities including tonka beans and
Fairtrade organic honey mera queen of
Atlantis in both the Justice League and
upcoming Aquaman film portrayed by Amber
Heard has taken up a new role with
L'Oreal Paris
the former Friday Night Lights actress
is serving as their global spokesperson
making her first appearance on behalf of
the brand at the Cannes Film Festival
2018 where she'll be starring in worth
it show a talk show honoring women in
cinema beauty and Beyond inspired by the
company's slogan amber will be in good
company is the face of L'Oreal joining
the likes with Julianne Moore
Neelam Gill and Eva Longoria amber
stated her pride by saying a quote I
feel like these women my fellow
ambassadors represent a voice of power a
movement and an opinion we spotted a
post in our Facebook group as you know
it's also called whatsapp and makeup
where a member purchased a covergirl
peacock flare mascara and check the date
only to find that it kept coming up as a
having been manufactured in 2009 this is
weird because the product only launched
in the past six months now there are
some sources who say the companies will
recycle codes after some time has passed
we have no direct statement at the time
of filming for any company we reached
out to but our reporters started
checking random peacock flare mascaras
and other products from various
retailers here's what we found
given the unrelated samples of the
peacock flare we found most gave the
same results manufactured in 2009 this
seems to bear out the recycled code
theory the reporters checked other
products to see if their codes had been
recycled many of them came up valid
singular codes with an x-ray date
befitting a newer product still others
came up with missing or invalid codes
including this tube of Paul Mitchell
product which is
obviously expired and even this favorite
of our para left crew Maybelline's touch
of spice check fresh did have the proper
info on that though just so you know
needing a brain break our reporter took
a quick walk through Walgreens using
multiple check sources and spotted
expired foundations now the question of
the hour can the check sources be
trusted well we feel they can data can
be checked across multiple sources and
we think our viewers are pretty
well-versed in what products are new in
case they run across one with a recycled
code common sense wins a day and with
that let's hit it
our reporter visited the Harris Teeter
where she has continually found expired
Revlon foundation and you won't be
surprised to learn that the Revlon
foundations were still there she grabbed
the selection and took them yet again to
the managers desk there was a different
person on duty a woman
our reporter presented the bottles and
explained her concern she says I told
her that not all of them have expiration
dates on the back but as she could see
they didn't look great I showed her one
that had an expiration date engraved in
the bottle and told her that's been
expired since 2014 she thanked me the
person on duty said they have a vendor
who does that aisle and said quote they
obviously aren't doing their job and we
agree have events been set in motion at
last tune in next time to find out
