put it all together in a script so I
don't function a way to present it to
you so thank you Tabitha for your hard
work this week are you watching the
makeup minute Monday through Friday 60
seconds of news you can use lots of
really cool releases this week that we
talked about this week so hopefully
you're watching those so you can make
sure you were up-to-the-minute up to
date on everything you know in the world
of beauty just as a quick announcement I
am working on closing down be what's up
in makeup app if you are a what's the
makeup app reporter their names are
scrolling right here below me then we
are replacing the what's up and makeup
app with a what's been makeup Facebook
group to report the things that you have
seen anywhere online that you want to
share that you think are newsworthy for
the show we are working on that that
should be happening within
next couple of weeks of transition from
the app to the Facebook group if you
have any questions about that you can
always email me at Jen Lowe's reviews at
gmail.com chat today we'll be at 10 a.m.
Eastern Time I'm sorry I couldn't swing
it be 5 p.m. chat this week and I'm sad
to say there will be no chat the
following week my family has plans to go
to Hershey Park in Pennsylvania and it's
just it's crazy because sundaes are our
family day so sometimes family just
comes before the chat and I'm really
sorry but I do get ready for filming of
what set the makeup on periscope every
single week so if you want to come and
just chat and hang out then you can
definitely join me on periscope just
download the periscope app I come on
anytime between 12:00 and 1:00 on
Fridays so that is another way to
interact with the community we also join
the west's and makeup Facebook group and
interact there and ask questions there
there's just lots of ways it's dissipate
in the community and I'm really sorry
that I haven't been able to swing that 5
p.m. chat but we are going to get there
eventually one day we will have a 5 p.m.
and I will be so thankful when we do so
thank you again so much for watching
