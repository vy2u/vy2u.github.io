Lowe's reviews and what's up Omega
starts now welcome to what's been makeup
for April 30th 2017 let's get started
with the top industry news shea moisture
is in hot water over a new ad people are
raging on social media about the
exclusion of kinkier textured hair and
darker skin tones in their latest hair
hate video the ad is about hair issues
and insecurities but does not include
the kinky tightly coiled texture that
initially made the brand of success
while many women of color seem to be
okay with the inclusion of other hair
types they are heard by what feels like
a blatant decision by the brand to no
longer feature them as part of the
target audience CBS will be joining the
ranks of the companies that have decided
to clean up their product the
multi-billion dollar company will be
removing three controversial ingredients
from their almost 600 beauty products
the chains in-house beauty brands
including blade Beauty 360 and essence
of beauty are all expected to be paraben
sale Aid and comment from aldehyde donor
free by 2019
what is one phrase that all makeup
enthusiasts love to hear beauty on a
budget shot miss a originally gained
popularity a few years back when they
launched with just accessories they then
added some beauty items and landed in
the radar of makeup lovers with many
quality items at just one dollar now
they're at it again with their newest
brand launched AOA studio although the
brand has many items ranging from liquid
lipsticks to color correctors the real
standouts are the makeup brushes here
are just a few the flat top kabuki brush
large fan brush precise pencil brush
angled shader brush these are all just a
dollar each essential 24 piece brush set
is only $20 the basis of a great look is
great skin but there's still one factor
that can ruin it all the Sun saving our
skin from the Sun can sometimes feel
like a losing battle but that's about to
change
Paul Starr has launched a new anti-aging
ingredient that took the silver at the
end Cosmetics global innovation
ingredient Awards in London called
mica it is
designed to block formation of
light-induced oxidase stress Robert Hume
vice-president of research and
development for Hall star stated Micah's
breakthrough Chemistry represents a
whole new category of Sun care
protection and anti-aging because it
halts the photo aging process before it
starts independent clinical research
shows that Michael
unlike sunscreens or antioxidants
prevents 100% of free radicals ro s
inflammation and DNA damage from UVA and
visible light at a use level of only
0.2% we've all been there wake up one
morning and you'll find yourself
crashing a party in VIP City well some
of us only get one or two here there but
for others it seems to never end but
that might be changing sooner than you
think a team of scientists at the
University of California San Diego are
in the process of developing an acne
vaccine Eric C Hong leader researcher
for the team told alors that acne is
caused in part by P acnes bacteria that
are with you your whole life and we
couldn't create a vaccine for the
bacteria because in some ways P acnes
are good for you but we found an
antibody to a toxic protein that P acnes
bacteria secrete on the skin the protein
is associated with the inflammation that
leads to acne the vaccine is still in
the testing phase which should last
about two years so hang in there help
