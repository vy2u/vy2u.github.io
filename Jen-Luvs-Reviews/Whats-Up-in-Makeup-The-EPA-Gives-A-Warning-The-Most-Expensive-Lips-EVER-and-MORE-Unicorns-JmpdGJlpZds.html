these world record lips and yeah I'm Jen
from Jen loves reviews and was it a
nigga starts now welcome to what didn't
make up for April 23rd 2017 let's get
started with the top industry news most
of us have seen advertisements and
thought no way does that product do all
of that well that's exactly what the
Advertising Standards Authority thought
about the new Rimmel London cara
delevingne reloaded mascara
advertisement according to the AAA the
videos use of abundant airbrushing
exaggerated the effects of the mascara
to a misleading degree this led them to
ban the advertisement from UK television
Cody UK rimmel's parent company stands
firm that Kara had naturally long in
full lashes and the AG properly
represents the product but they did
reveal that in order to see the lashes
better against her smoky eye they added
individual lash inserts to create a
uniform line and added lashes in
post-production the a-si is standing by
their decision issuing this reply
because the ID conveyed a volumizing
lengthening and thickening effect of the
product we consider the Yuuzhan lash
inserts and post production technique
we're likely to exaggerate the effect
beyond what could be achieved by the
product among consumers usually the last
thing most of us think about is whether
or not the beauty products we use our
life threatening according to the ewg
skin-deep database we should be thinking
exactly that the database shows that 14
dioxane a cancer-causing agent is found
and at least 8,000 common personal care
products on the market how is this
possible in the simplest terms the FDA
has yet to ban the use of the chemical
although it has been classified by the
EPA as a likely carcinogen fortunately
two senators Schumer and Gillibrand
demanded action when 71 percent of the
Long Island water supply were found to
have concentrated levels of dioxin in
them this along with the ewg finding
that forty-six percent of personal care
items can't
the ingredient where do we go from here
while the ewg has sent surveys to 500
manufacturers inquiring how they plan to
rid their products of dioxane senators
Gillibrand and shimmer are hoping their
petition goes through and that it will
help protect everyone from exposure to
this potentially harmful ingredient
we'll keep you in the loop you better
hold on to your wallet WWD reports that
NYX Cosmetics is coming to walgreens
