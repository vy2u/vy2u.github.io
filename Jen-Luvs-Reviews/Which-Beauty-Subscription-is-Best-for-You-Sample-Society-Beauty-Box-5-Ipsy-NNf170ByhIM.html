subscription might be right for you well
I am going to tell you about three
different subscriptions that I have been
subscribed to since August and you may
be able to match up what type of box
might be right for you I'm going to go
ahead and start with sample society
sample society comes like this it's
fifteen dollars a month and it is
designed by Allure magazine and this is
mostly a skin care hair care kind of
subscription so if you're really into
that then this might be the one for you
it doesn't usually come with a lot of
makeup products I'll show you the
November box I did unsubscribe from this
one so I only have the November box we
got a perfume that I don't particularly
care for this is the second one of these
two TKE perfumes that we've gotten um to
me it's 240 it smells very um 90 years
old kind of smell for me I don't enjoy
this um but they give you that we also
got this dermatological skincare um it
is a cleansing gel and a pre cleanse the
pre kind of lens was kind of pointless
to me I did enjoy the cleansing gel we
got this a lot the octane on hand cream
which I love my daughter has very dry
hands and this worked out very well for
her and then we also got this little
teeny teeny tiny lipstick that I did not
care for I did not really like the color
and it's a very very small makeup sample
so I did not enjoy that very much but
make up in these boxes are very very
rare for sample society so if you prefer
a hair care skin care kind of stuff then
sample society will probably be the best
one out of these three for you next up
we have beauty box 5 no beauty box 5 is
a lot of brands that you may never have
heard of you get a nice mix of skin care
hair care and makeup items in beauty box
5 i'll show you what we got for november
first now in november the first thing we
got was this bamboo smooth candy oil dry
mist this did nothing for my hair it
supposed to be for strong sleek frizz
free hair is what that's supposed to do
it did not work for me but we got that
we also got this glitter that is
supposed to be four eyes I did not enjoy
that it's not a color
would use we got the cetaphil lotion
which is a nice lotion but you might as
well give me Lubriderm or something like
that I mean this is like a drug store
thing I thought that was kind of weird
to get something drugstore in there so
nice lotion but come on people alright
and then we got this global goddess
shalini bought a hair on shine um it's
like a it's a hair treatment at coconut
I'm la revitalizing hair treatment the
beauty secret of india and i really like
the way this made my hair feel we got
two packets of this really enjoyed this
um we also got this this is a face mask
and you can see the way that goes on you
and i will show you a picture of me
wearing this this was the most
uncomfortable unpleasant thing ever to
wear it was very slightly and cold i did
not enjoy doing this and I saw note
results it is supposed to be an eye
treatment that provides hydration and
revitalize the eye area very strange
strange product there and then we got
this lipgloss by model code that I love
it's got the mirror on the side nice
nude color for this love this okay so
that was um November's box this is
December's beauty box 50 finally beauty
box five is ten dollars per month if you
get three months if you only get one
month it's $12 three months it is ten
dollars over December we got these
cleansing pads that I really really like
nice smell cucumber II like those a lot
also got this eyeshadow giant giant eye
shadow by offres it is in golden sparkle
it is very orangie it has gold glitter
it is not very wearable for me maybe
blended with other colors it might work
got another mask and I will not be
trying this because I so hated the other
one and this one goes actually all over
your face there's I holes a little nose
hole and a mouth hole it looks like uh
no thank you i will pass this on I don't
even want this on my face because the
last experience was so bad and then my I
had actually unsubscribed from beauty
box five and then I found that this was
going to be in the box so i subscribed
again they got me which was this makeup
brush by everyday minerals and i love
this brush is whoo it is a flat top
brush I needed a blush brush I know this
is
autumn blush brush but I use it for
blush and it works beautifully i love
this brush so this to me was worth the
ten dollars alone just to get this brush
so that is beauty box five branch mostly
branch you've never heard of mix of skin
care hair care and makeup items finally
we have my personal favorite which is FC
previously known as my glam you get a
bag like this every month you get a new
bag which i use i always use these for
something this one was November's it is
a little bit dirty because i have been
using it and i thought a lot of products
i think i got an extra product in this
bag but I love love love love love love
FC because you get a lot of brands that
you've heard of Sephora for Sephora
brands hautelook brands this was what I
hadn't heard of this is nail'd teeny
nail polish unfortunately I did not
enjoy this nail polish and just to tell
you what this is kind of like every year
we put up our fig tree my cat likes to
eat the fake tree thing the tree
whatever the leaves or whatever from our
fake tree and then he throws it up
that's what this nail polish reminds me
of it is a very randomly size gold and
green glitter and i did not enjoy this
at all i did not like the way it looked
on my nails i really wanted to love it
did not love it also got this very there
in cute little tiny by the foam of meat
matte shadow this is it Matt Batali it's
a dark brown love the shadow beautiful
if you can get your hands on look bomb
the bomb eyeshadows they're wonderful we
also got this Moxie by marvelous Moxie
by bare minerals this is a beautiful
lipgloss I'm actually wearing it now put
it on again because I think it's all
gone by now but but it's beautiful i
love love love love this color i don't
know oh it's in daredevil nice it's got
that mint eNOS to it nice smell not
sticky love this we also got this black
eye liner in starlet it is a pencil
liner and lasting power was pretty good
it is a little bit hard but nice nice
line are there and this is what i think
i got to both products i think it was
only supposed to get one this is by
cello or Shella it is an eyebrow
defining
this did not work for me at all to me it
just kind of is a nice brush with some
kind of wetness over my eyes they my I
not excuse me out my eyes but my
eyebrows to kind of put them in place
but it definitely does not hold my brows
in place at all this fear is one of my
favorite discoveries and you will see
this in my next video which is my 2012
favorites video and this is the benefit
they're real mascara this stuff is
amazing i'm telling you it makes your
lashes look thick there are beautiful
long gorgeous lashes they don't look
real though it's it's they make them
look like just if you want to look like
you're wearing fake lashes without
wearing fake lashes this lives up to the
name amazing i'm so thankful the Ipsy
send this to me so I could try it i will
be buying a full size of this no doubt
about it so that was no members back i
will show you December's back now if you
contribute into the FC website in any
way i have a couple videos up there and
made a calm down a couple reviews they
gave you an extra products and what they
gave us was a sample of the new urban
decay naked skin baby cream and i
thought that was really nice so this is
what they gave us and i love this i
absolutely love it and like I will
probably be behind a full size of this
when it comes out if I can pay the forty
dollars remember the world's don't cause
but I love the way this made my skin
look it wasn't so light of a coverage
that you couldn't see it and it was just
I love the way it me my skin feels just
amazing I really enjoyed this and I used
it four times before I ran out of the
sample so it was really happy with this
size even though it was small I use it
pretty well and then we got these my
Couture highlighting papers and what I'm
doing with these these are really nice
I'm enjoying these I tear off a piece of
it and then just highlight my um my
cheekbones and my brow and then I'm done
and I can do it with just a third of the
strip so I'm really enjoying these love
these so happy to have had those a mere
full-size near
belif primer and this is for our face
and eyes and this is the best primer I
have ever used for my face it is amazing
and it's full size and epsy costs ten
dollars this is a $28 primer and we got
a full size with our 10 on my bag
amazing along with that we got a knicks
pigment which I've never used because i
didn't think i would like the bottle and
i don't really like the bottle but i
really enjoyed using this a couple times
that i've used it it stayed on all day
love this and we got this I do not enjoy
this this is a lip gloss um by be a
bombshell I did not enjoy the eyeliner
we got from them either but this red
color is not for me it's an orange e
undertone red color and this is not a
color that I would ever wear I'm going
to be passing so long my friend Kenda hi
Canada she is blonde and she can get
away with this color I cannot so she
will be getting this but it is full-size
I mean for 10 bucks and hello we got an
urban decay 24-7 glide on eye pencil and
this is in zero which is their black and
I already have this and the backup of it
so i will be using this probably forgive
away eventually Nextiva way will be an
end of january or early februari for
valentines day and I've got some amazing
stuff for that so if you enjoy makeup
products primarily very few skincare
items mostly make a property will love
