to show you that I got for my birthday
my birthday was on June 8th and I turned
mm-hmm
something older my husband was kind
enough to take me to Sephora for my
birthday and he said pretty much that I
could go nuts so I did and I'm kind of
regretting it because you know it's my
money too not just his but at the same
time I'm not regretting it because I got
some amazing things out my goodness of
amazing things I'm not going to show you
everything I'm only going to show you
the pallets I got I'm going to save
everything else for another video this
video is going to be obnoxious if I show
you everything in one video so show you
the four pallets that I got first and
one that I got was the Too Faced matte
eye palette and this thing is so
wonderful it kind of reminds me of the
meet matte nude palette but just
different colors let me show you what's
in here um we have tufted suede
Velveteen bunny fresh linen chinchilla
pebbles vintage violet coffee bean
London Fog and midnight and this is just
a really nice well-rounded neutral
palette and my experience with this so
far has just been absolutely fantastic
it is so the colors blend so nicely into
each other it makes me never want to use
a shimmer shadow again be completely
honest I mean I'm sure that I will and I
have since I've gotten this but just the
way that the matte colors flow together
it's just stinking gorgeous and the
softness of these shadows shutters are
incredibly soft they're incredibly
pigmented I'll show you just a few
swatches
I'm not going to swatch everything
because I'm sure you can find these
swatches online if you're curious but
I'll just show you those the coffee bean
London Fog at midnight and that's one
one swipe of those I mean just
absolutely gorgeous let me show you this
Velveteen bunny one I mean just
absolutely beautiful highlight color I
mean just perfect absolutely perfect I
mean it just
Oh loving this absolutely loving this
palette next up is one that I'm sure
you've seen a gazillion times I'm not
going to spend too much time on it and
it's the naked basics palette I have
been wanting this for so long and I
looked at it so many times and I just
haven't gotten it yet but I'll show you
just in case for some strange reason you
haven't seen it yet one of the reasons
why I hesitated on getting this is
because these shades look so incredibly
similar and honestly on the eye they do
seem similar unless you're really
looking at it I mean nobody except for
people that would watch this video will
notice really the difference between
these I mean it does start to get a
little darker but me are they gorgeous I
mean they're just incredibly beautiful
and you know this one's a little bit
shimmery this one's a little yellow too
and this is a little pink tone and this
is a little bit tan toned and then of
course the fawn and the Elmo's caught it
crap and then crave fawn and crave of
course are a little bit darker but I
mean just beautifully blended soft
pigmented all of that magical nastain a
kid palette and I apologize if I just
blinded you next up I got the NARS and
God created woman palette and I was so
stinking excited to get this and this is
actually I do love this don't get me
wrong I do love this I mean the shadows
are gorgeous
you've got your like a pinky color a
grey like Ray you've got a golden bronze
a brown shimmer a brown matte and a
black shimmer these are of course it's a
NARS anything is going to be probably
pretty amazing and this is amazing these
are really super super pigmented they're
a little bit harder for me to blend the
first time I use this palette I actually
had to take off my makeup and start over
because I just made a mess of my eyes it
just looks stupid but I think with a
little bit more practice I will get
better at this but if you are new to
using eyeshadow I don't suggest you get
this as your first palette but it they
are gorgeous shades gorgeous colors and
once I get practicing with this I'm sure
that I will get better at using it but
for now this is my least favorite of the
ones that I bought for my birthday the
last one that I want to show you is
actual
I'm very surprised is my favorite of
these and it is the ladybird palette by
Kat Von D I really I've been looking at
and looking at it and all I can know
about this I'm like I might get it and
then I saw it I was like you know what
I'm just going to get it because it is
again I'm crazy about Matt I right now
it is a matte palette and I just OH
ladies ladies ladies the amazingness
that is in this palette it comes with a
brown eyeliner that reminds me a lot of
the Urban Decay 24/7 liners same
creaminess all of that and it is a brown
one in immortal love love this
but let me oh my gosh just gorgeous I
have not used every shade in this this
one scares me a little bit but I'm sure
with the new red I can rock this somehow
but I will work it out but I've used
most of these colors and they're just
you can create some of the most
beautiful looks with this palette
because they are matte but you've got
some really cool colors in there that
are just really fun to play with I mean
this is just a fun
I'm blinding you again alright this is
just a fun fun fun palette and I love it
so much just because of the versatility
of the different colors and how you can
put things together and again make
something like meet Matt nude I mean it
just this is this is my favorite thing
that I got if you're going to get a nude
palette at Sephora I would recommend
this one over any of the others that I
got followed closely second to this one
here the matte eye and then the Naked
basics because it is so basic and then
the NARS was my least favorite of these
