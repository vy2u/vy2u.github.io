highly requested video that I am very
very nervous to film this is my why I
quit teaching video I have had so many
requests for this since I said that I
might do it and I wasn't going to do it
because I wanted to still have a window
open to go substitute at my old school I
wanted to be able to go back and I am
really really loving doing YouTube
full-time and I feel like at this point
I don't want to go back I miss my
friends I miss my students but I just
don't I don't want to go back and work
and I'm ok with that I've kind of
accepted that and I feel like the risk
that I'm taking making this video is
worth it for how it may help my friends
I don't know how many people will end up
seeing this video and I think that's
where my nerves come from is I don't
know how far this video is going to go
and if it will incite change but if it
doesn't even go far it's it's a nice
it's an interesting video to see the
insides of teaching and what it's really
like like I'm getting upset like
thinking about making this video like I
don't really knew what I wanted to do
for a living and then I ended up in
college I was at a community college
where I got my associates degree in
mental health I did that for three years
then I went to university as an
occupational therapy major I did that
for a couple months realized that wasn't
for me and because of the internships
I'd done at Community College I decided
I wanted to go into special education so
I got my undergraduate degree in special
education it took me a really long time
I got that and then I also got an
undergraduate degree in psychology
because I had so many extra credits
floating around I only needed one more
semester to get a double major I got
certified to teach general ed and
special ed and then eventually I got my
masters in elementary reading and
literacy I taught for 11 years as I
taught I started off in special
education self-contained so kids with
severe learning disabilities I taught
there for five years I did inclusion for
a year which is where you go into
general education classrooms and you
help the kids who have special education
needs then I took a year off to spend
time with my
as he was a little teeny tiny baby so I
was on maternity leave for a year and
then I went back to doing inclusion for
a year I taught fourth grade general
education for two years including the
advanced academics reading class and
then I taught last year I taught
inclusion one more time and that was
what kind of pushed me over the edge so
all right you guys know how much I love
YouTube I've been doing YouTube for four
years it is my passion it's what I love
to do but I tried to do both and I
realize I just couldn't do both the time
restrictions for teaching I mean the
even if I wasn't trying to do YouTube
along with teaching there was just no
way that I could do my job well with the
demands that were placed on me it's just
impossible and I'm one of those people
that if I can't do something well I
don't want to do it at all and that was
really what pushed me over the edge a
lot of the things that affected me
personally I can't talk about because
I'm not trying to throw anybody under
the bus some things happening to
teachers around me that it just it broke
my heart and I just couldn't watch it
anymore I couldn't watch seeing that
happen but what I will tell you is that
the teachers did not let it affect the
students the teachers were so amazing
that no matter what was happening to
them but no matter how much stress they
were under they never let the kids see
it and they did everything they could
despite the demands despite all the
roadblocks put in front of them they did
everything he could to make it so the
kids didn't know about it didn't know
about how hard they were working or the
demands put on them that they thought
were so unreasonable
they made a way to make it work and
that's why I just I have so much
admiration for people still in the field
I feel like I left my um my you know
soldiers in battle you know I left them
on the battlefield and I feel really
guilty about that sorry so because I'm
getting emotional I'm going to take a
little break and I'm going to show you a
video that I made actually for my
administration so they would know what
the teachers were going through there is
one mistake in it it says that it's 40
minutes of planning
time when it's actually 50 minutes of
planning time but I want to go ahead and
show you this video so you can get kind
of a picture of what it was like to be a
teacher and what it currently is like to
be a teacher all right welcome to why
teachers burn out and here's my little
fire with little sparks going off of it
all right I'm going to teach you a
little bit about why teachers are
burning out in today's educational
society so starts off with the beginning
of the school year and I like to think
of the beginning of the school year like
a race here's our starting line okay and
you've got a bunch of kids here that are
starting right at the starting line
they're excited they're ready for let's
say fourth grade yeah and they're all so
happy they got mom and dad at home
helping them they're excited they're
ready to start fourth grade so you've
got these kids here then you've got a
few kids over here okay they already
know some of the information in fourth
grade they're ready to go they've got
probably some fifth grade skills they're
there they're solid they're ready to go
but they're at a different place where
these guys are then you've got kids that
are here they're a little bit behind
they're not maybe not so happy about
school but they're ready to start the
year then you've got kids that are way
back here you've got a couple of kids
back here they may be happy they may be
angry okay got all kinds of stuff
they're not you know you had angry kids
everywhere and everyone but this guy
right here he's got a broken leg he's
going to go super slow now this analogy
is kind of where kids are academically
so you've got kids starting to you're on
grade level above grade level slightly
below grade level really below grade
level and really group below grade level
with problems like learning disabilities
processing deficits things like that
they're going to make it really
difficult for them to catch up to these
guys over here okay so as a classroom
teacher you're dealing with all of these
kids maybe even in the same
room at the same time so what a teachers
have to do in order to help all of these
kids get to the end of the line which is
the end of fourth grade or whatever
grade they are going to be in so this is
what ends up happening this is this is
what's happening where we're at so
you've got your teacher teacher starts
the lesson with the whole group so
you've got your class all sitting here
maybe they're in tables where they're
sitting together all these kids and
they're all ready to learn some of them
are some aren't you know some of them
are indifferent they're you know just
hanging out their desks you've got about
25 of them sitting there I'm not going
to draw them all okay and this teachers
teaching they teach their whole group
lesson then what happens is is you got
now you got to make your groups okay
so you've got billion and Jessie over
here who are way ahead of the game
they're not going to be able to have the
same lesson as Johnny and Susie back
here because Johnny and Susie can't do
the things that billion whatever whoever
else I said can do okay so you got to do
totally different lessons even these
guys aren't going to be able to do what
these guys can do this guy's not gonna
be able to do what these guys can do so
now you have to plan for all of these
kids instruction okay so that they could
all learn all right that's our job as
educators make sure that no child is
left behind make sure that every child
learns that's your job that's what we do
so what you do is you end up making
groups okay so you've got three groups
of kids sometimes more okay teacher
teaches this group Group a group B and
Group C they're all different levels
okay they treat each group a for 20
minutes so this is a planned lesson with
group a for 20 minutes while these guys
are learning with the teacher while
those guys are learning with the teacher
these guys are maybe doing some
extension work to kind of teach them to
the next thing these guys are doing a
preview of what they're going to do with
the teacher in 20 minutes okay
20
it goes by okay so teachers plan for
this teachers plan for this extension
with this group they plan the preview
for this group 20 minutes goes by now
Roubaix is now doing extension work or
reteach work okay Ruby who is doing
extension is now doing maybe more
extension maybe they are doing a
different skill something else maybe
it's a project group C is now with the
teacher so teacher has now planned this
lesson the extension for this lesson and
something else for this group so this is
20 minutes time goes by 20 minutes so
teacher has now planned six different
activities well they may be the same
activities but they're different because
each kid is on a dip each group is on a
different level 20 minutes goes by now
group a is doing their reteach maybe
another reteach group with a special
educator or some other kind of support
staff if you're lucky the sports staff
person has planned that lesson okay Ruby
who was originally an extension they've
done something else Group B is now with
the teacher doing some work okay she has
no arms apparently and Group C is now
doing some extension work on what they
did with the teacher teacher has plans
now all of these things okay they've
planned 20 minutes here they've planned
these three things they've planned these
three things and they've planned these
three things okay probably as much as
been given by the curriculum is probably
this has been given by the curriculum
and maybe one of these pages the rest
needs to be made up by the teacher okay
now let's say the teacher now the lesson
is now over now you're an hour
and okay you're an hour in now we need
to figure out a writing activity writing
or grammar grammar spelling all of that
needs to be fit in at three different
levels a B and C we also need to take an
account of our learning styles tactile
visual auditory then we got to take into
consideration disabilities modifications
kids that were absent okay how are we
going to catch them up all of that needs
to be taken into consideration not only
for the writing grammar and spelling but
for every one of these lessons all of
that needs to be taken into
consideration
now if the teacher is lucky she's
departmentalized or he's
departmentalized it only has to worry
about one subject being reading if
they're not now teacher needs to plan
the math lesson and we start a B and C
all over again format then I need to
plan social studies usually in social
studies or science you can have one
group of all your kids but this guy and
this guy can't read the core text so we
need to figure out how we're going to
get them to be able to read the core
text all of this happens for one day
this is one day's worth of planning all
of this for all of these different kinds
of kids one day of planning why teachers
are burning out teachers are burning out
because this is too much it's too much
it's too much it's too much it's too
much it's too much because on top of
that there's more emails to parents data
collection grading
all of that is also factored in and how
much planning time do we get 40 minutes
per day to do all of this
that's why teachers are burning out and
see the balance of home and school there
is none there is not if you're trying to
do your job well and the guilt-trip that
is laid on you if you can't do it if you
can't do all of these things you're made
out to be bad at your job and it's just
not fair it's not fair the demands that
are placed you know and when someone
says oh well teaching is not a
nine-to-five job you're expected to do
things off school hours every teacher
knows they're expected to do things off
school hours but for how many hours for
how many hours it cannot consume your
life you it's not right it's wrong it's
absolutely wrong the way teachers are
being treated right now and it's you
know if you don't do this then you
obviously don't care about your students
if you don't do all of this then you
obviously aren't good at your job you're
not a good teacher and it's like if you
would just listen people in charge if
you would just listen to the teachers
and listen to what we're telling you
about how it can be better
they we're not trusted as professionals
to know what we're doing we're babysat
to the minut details of everything we're
doing everything we're doing has to be
watched over to make sure we're doing it
exactly the way we're told to do but yet
we're told to individualize things for
kids but you can't individualize it
because if you individualize it then
you're not only spending a stupid amount
of time modifying things but you're also
then slammed down because you didn't do
exactly what you were told to do and
it's like there's so much confusion and
so much double standard and there's so
much do this but don't do this and it's
just too much so here's where I offer
solutions here's the big solution let
the teachers teach just let them teach
give them the standards tell them what
you want them to teach give them
materials give them a
curriculum and then just let them teach
let them do what is best for the
children in their classroom if you ask
any teacher you'll they'll tell you I
created all of this stuff this year
let's say last school year I created all
of this stuff and I did all of this for
my students and I'm going to save it for
next year ask them how much of it they
use another year you can't you can't use
it another year a lot of the things
because the kids change the kids are
different from your year their needs are
different their interests are different
you can't just carry things over from
your year and what what what our
government fails to understand is it the
only person that's truly going to know
what's best in that classroom is the
teacher and you've got to let go when
you have if your mom and you have a
child you're at the hospital do they
give you an instruction manual manual
that tells you exactly how to raise your
child no they don't why don't they why
don't they tell you exactly what you
should do in every situation because
every family and every child is
different every classroom culture is
different every teacher is different
every group of students is different and
and there's so much micromanaging from
up above trying to tell teachers what's
best for their kids and that is what's
killing American public education is
that teachers do not have enough control
over what happens in their classroom if
you get lucky you have a wonderful
principal that understands that and
isn't afraid to let you do what you need
to do to help your students and trust
you I would say the majority of
principals out there are trying to do
their job trying to do what they're told
from up above so they spread those
messages to their teachers creating all
of this problem so if you are in
government or if you know somebody in
government that works in education law
please please please have them spend one
day in a classroom have them go to a
classroom after school see the teacher
planning have the teacher go through
exactly what they do to plan a lesson
then the next day go in and help it be
implemented watch it be implemented see
what the teachers go through in order to
meet the needs of their students one day
one day that's my challenge principals
people in educational law you have to
get in the classroom if you want to know
what in the world
should be happening in a classroom and
that's the big problem is we've got all
these political science majors
graduating from college thinking they
know all of this stuff creating all of
these laws and they've never spent one
day in a classroom how does that even
make any sense it makes no sense
whatsoever none there needs to be a
tremendous overhaul in the public
education system and I am terrified for
what's going to be happening in the next
few years because it doesn't seem like
either political candidate has talked at
all about education I have not seen one
thing come up about public education in
the debate or any other time it's not a
topic it's not a topic and I'm terrified
because it should be a topic it should
be something that is important to
everybody because the kids in school
today are our next world leaders they're
our next presidents they're our next
government officials and if we don't
take care of them what's going to happen
to our country and that's my big point
so I want to thank you so much for
watching this video I hope that you
learn something from it it's not my
typical video that I make on the channel
and please know that this is not
something that I will be doing often but
it was highly requested and I feel like
the message needs to get out there so if
you feel the need please definitely feel
free to share this with anybody you
think that will find it interesting
