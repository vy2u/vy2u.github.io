favorites September is finished which
means we're moving into october and i'm
going to start smelling those wonderful
fall smells that we smell over here in
the central east coast so excited for
fall I'm trying to keep it short so I
narrowed it down to my favorites like
seven things and then three fails so
let's go ahead and start off with the
three fails first and one of my
favorites right now oh look at my hair
you guys like the curls thumbs up for
curls first thumbs down is this pure
silk rich and luxurious shave cream this
stuff is horrible okay it is the worst
shaving cream I have ever used in my
entire life okay up the purpose of a
shave cream is it supposed to help the
razor move across your skin easier I'm
telling you this stuff makes it so hard
look I am better off using just water
then putting the stuff of my legs
because it makes my razor go like
skipping up my legs no this is going in
the trash why not using that anymore so
excited to throw that away this is no
shocker to me I had a feeling this was
going to be a fail as soon as I open it
and is the pixie lash booster mascara
okay if you want your lashes to be a
darker color that's what this does there
is no lengthening there is no volumizing
all it does is make them what color
whatever color this is a black color
I'll show you the one just for fun let's
focus on you and your minute I know baby
let's look at the wand typical spoolie
wand look you can already see how clumpy
that
can you see the Colombian is already
starting yeah I mean clomp clomp city I
mean I I seriously use this maybe three
times and it's already clumping on the
side not a good sign at all well again
I'm not surprised that I hate this
because I've pretty much hated every pic
see product that i've ever used the only
thing that i did not hate was the lip I
guess someone who maybe that was by pop
beauty but pop and pixie I both to me I
cannot sting in their products I
actually got offered to be sponsored by
pixie and pop beauty by a friend of mine
who worked there and I told her that
there can feel free to send me things
but I hated basically everything that
they have ever made that I have ever
tried and of needless to say I've never
got anything from them but that just
shows you how real I am I don't like
this company refuse being sponsored by a
company that has products that I hate
this is also gonna go they love drawing
product it's super fun last fail is a
high-end fail if you don't know Sephora
has the new Sephora favorites kids out i
bought the lip gloss one the eyeliner
one and the mascara one but now there
are a whole bunch more ready for the
holiday seasons this Sephora liquid
liner within the eyeliner one this stuff
is horrible so that is how Matt's
watches I have some old swatches up
there please excuse my old swatches so
i'll show you kind of how that applies
loop see how it's like nearly clear I
mean just horrible horrible quality I
don't know what they were thinking this
was actually in the kit last year or the
support favorites whatever you want to
call it last year and actually really
like this one this is the roll-up pencil
version of that but watch how pretty
that is I mean that is just creamy and
gorgeous I don't know what that is it's
in glitter black and it is horrible
quality Oh going to Trish next up
favorite lots of favors lots of good
favorite I'm not sure if you all know
this by him an eyeshadow junkie I love I
shadow I if I could have every single
color of the entire
rainbow of eyeshadow i would buy it and
then i would try to find dupes like I'm
that big of an eye shadow junkie my
friend just for grain 518 who I met on
keek but also has a YouTube channel was
so kind enough to send me three of the
wet and wild palettes these are from the
the army collection so I was so thankful
because I can never find any of the one
wild limited editions around me so
thankful and these are wonderful heard
some negative things about the pop
collection the ones that we're in the
white containers that have all the
really bright colors heard some of them
weren't very pigmented these are
fabulous and I've heard that a lot of
places have these on discount right now
because they're clearing them out for
the next set of limited edition so if
you can still find these I suggest you
get them this one is my favorite being
listing for beauty love this one this
one is in zero dark flirty and then this
one is soldiers in charms I'm actually
where I soldiers and charms today so you
can even get my eyebrows done but how to
show you that's all soldiers and charms
there okay I'm going to go ahead ice
watch all these babies on my arms so we
go ahead and zoom in and show you that
this is soldiers and charms this is the
this is the brow bone color this is the
crease color and then this is the lid
color and then this one is the enlisting
for beauty this is the brow bone color
this is the crease color this
is the lid color and then this one is
the zero dark and blurry this is the
brow bone this is the crease and then
this is the lid if you want to see a
really good video with all of that
entire line swatched my friend chica for
22 she's gotta jiggle loves makeup I
think it's what she just changed her
name to but anyway I will put her link
down below she's got swatches of every
single one of the eyeshadows from this
line and she did a fabulous job on that
videos i'll link her video down below if
you want to learn more about this
particular line of wet and wild I
shadows there you'll be really nice
speaking of being an eyeshadow junkie I
finally broke down and got the ammo
palette from urban decay I got this at
nordstrom rack i think it was either ten
or twelve dollars you can find these on
the urban decay website discounted and
then other places i mean they're
discounted all over the place i think
urban decay is trying to clear them out
because they're getting kind of old but
i absolutely love love love this palette
it's got the cute little mirror there
and then all the shadows are just
gorgeous so if you happen to find this
it's definitely worth the discounted
price I don't know if it would have been
worth the full price to me i think it
was like 30 some dollars something like
that but it's definitely worth the
discounted price of ten or twelve
dollars even though it's an order
palette the shadows are fantastic and
really really fun to play with they are
all glitters and shimmers mostly
shimmers so if you're not into that you
won't like this but if you do like
glitters and shimmers I highly recommend
this one also I just got this in my new
Beauty test tube and you can tell it's
already been loved and it is my it
cosmetics our face brush love love love
this it is so soft oh my gosh it's very
soft and dense and it really really does
the job as far as packing on the
foundation or the powder that you need
in order to get a beautiful beautiful
look it is ridiculously priced I don't
know if I would have bought it just
because it's like 48 bucks but in my new
Beauty test tube I was so thankful to
have this I definitely will be using
this very very very often I love it it's
all I know
next up is actually a very strange
favorite but I'm really really loving
nail art having new obsession with
missjenfabulous and her easy nail art
for beginners tutorials absolutely love
those and she recommended that I go on
Amazon will not me specifically but all
you know 900,000 people or whatever that
watch that video to get some tools so i
will put the price I paid for these and
I'll put the link to the seller in the
description but these are stripers the
purpose of these is to make straight
lines on your nails and they're super
super easy to use I mean they look very
cheap but it doesn't even matter because
they work perfectly and I love these the
other one is this set of dotting tools I
want to say this was like two dollars
for all of these and what I love about
these is that they're all different
sizes and so you've got from very large
and then on the other side is very small
and they're just so fun to play with if
you're just getting started and nail art
like I am if you are interested in
starting off with nail art it's really
really fun and I definitely recommend
missjenfabulous videos because she
really makes it easy to do really cool
designs I get compliments on my nails
all the time people think I'm this big
nail artist and I'm not it's all Jen
it's not me I just follow the directions
like paint-by-number next favorite which
should i do lips chipper mascara
lipstick rimouski era let's go with
mascara well and this is the defenses
and I really really like this for
lengthening mostly for lengthening and
separating my lashes volumizing okay I
believe this is also in the lash stash
by sephora and the sephora favorites kit
i don't i'm not sure if they're
available in the stores are just online
but what they have is a little voucher
and then what you do is you pick your
favorite from the stash and they will
give you a full size of whichever one is
your favorite they give you with a
little coupon to bring it in to give you
a whole size so i think this is one of
the choices alright so i've got two more
favorites for you one of them is by
phyto and it is the phyto carotene
carotene keratin serum Oh
this stuff is supposed to mend your
split ends and I'm telling you this
stuff works it's crazy I had so many
split ends like I'm not even kidding
like it looked like a commercial for
split for like I hear him I mean it was
like branches everywhere I put this
stuff on and I'm not even kidding they
just all glued right together the only
thing it does not do is it does not
restore the texture of your hair so my
hair still is very dry on the end but at
least these split ends are not as crazy
as they once were so highly recommend
this stuff it is like a like creamy kind
of consistency and yeah you just rub
that into your end and I'm telling you
it seals them right up it is awesome
last favorite is one that I learned
about from a geek I learn a lot of stuff
for my friends on if you're not on
kekeke is kind of like Twitter or
Instagram for videos it's thirty six
second videos there's a bunch of us
beauty people on there and we have this
cute little community and we're getting
to know each other really well and it's
really fun but I learned this from
someone named Jennifer and her username
one cake is Colorado pinkie pie and
we're all begging her a start a YouTube
channel if she does I will let you know
because she's amazing and she would she
would blow up on youtube this is Airy
fairy by Rimmel and it has a little bit
I want to say it has a little bit of a
sentiment smell but it's not strong like
a sweet cinnamon and it's just it's very
creamy it's moisturizing wearing it
today it's so stick and pretty it is
such a nice nude natural for fall I love
to wear lipstick to work when they don't
like to wear crazy bright lipstick to
work all the time so this is a really
nice new tile swatch it for you and
again I am wearing on my lips today I'll
put a little fresher na na freshen it up
but yeah I mean just a really beautiful
nude lip I mean it doesn't get any more
beautiful than that in my opinion I
definitely get more of these rimmel
lipsticks because I am enjoying the
formula and I'd love to see what other
colors they have so I thank Jennifer
