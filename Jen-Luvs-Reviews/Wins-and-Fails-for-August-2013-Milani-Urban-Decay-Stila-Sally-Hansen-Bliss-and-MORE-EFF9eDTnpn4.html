been like a week or something crazy yeah
after besting beauty I just need to take
a week off because girl I just you know
I was done for a week you know what I
mean I'm not trying to burn myself out
best in beauty was a lot of work you
know I'm saying so now I'm back and I
wanted to share with you the things that
I have been loving and the month up
oddest you know what I'm just gonna get
to the chase I'm not gonna preface this
with anything else that's enough first
we're going to start with face and like
skincare contestar first thing is this
lemon sage body butter by bliss this
stuff is awesome okay except for the
smell it smells weird it smells like
seasoning for Turkey it's lemon and sage
I mean it's weird like I wish that they
came in a different scent I'm sure that
it does but um but yeah the texture of
this stuff is amazing it is so
moisturizing and just fabulous and i
highly recommend this i'm going to be
buying a another full-size version of
one of these hopefully they have a
different scent as soon as i run out of
this next up for skincare i have a big
old fail and that is the yes to carrots
nourishing moisturizing eye cream this
stuff burned the crap out of my eyeballs
I put this on my eyes and I'm not even
kidding tears were like streaming down
my face if you're gonna make an eye
cream yes to carrots people please make
it so it doesn't sting my eyeballs and I
had to use it a couple of nights to make
sure it really was this and I'm never
using that again awful awful awful
product but i did get these in my new
beauty test tube these are the lumen a
i'm not sure i'm saying they're a day
cream and a night cream now ladies this
is all i'm looking for in a face cream
i'm looking for something doesn't make
my face greasy i'm looking for something
that doesn't sting my eyeballs and i'm
looking for something that really if it
doesn't kind of seeps
my skin it doesn't make me feel like I
have a film on my face and these do that
I love them both I have been using the
night cream more than the day cream it's
just because I neither the night cream I
absolutely love my L'Oreal collagen day
cream so I've been using that a lot but
i do love both of these products i think
the full-size are quite expensive so i
don't know if i'll repurchase them but
if you are in the market for a high-end
cream check these out ok the next
product product is just a ridiculous
ridiculous fail on so many levels and it
is Sally Hansen natural beauty inspired
by Carmody luminizing face primer and I
don't think they make this anymore but
you've got to see this stuff something's
crazy first of all this is this is the
first problem look at this look I'll
spray it right at you nothing comes out
of the pump it is completely sinking
useless in the pump the pump doesn't
stink of work hold on a minute okay let
me so what I have to do to get the
product out as have to actually
physically open it up and you can see
you zoom in a little bit well I just
dreamed okay it's a good thing I don't
want to use this product okay and you
can see immediately why it's not going
to come out of the pump because the
stuff is too thick you would think that
a company like Sally Hansen would
realize that a really thick product is
not going to come out of a pump like
this you're the other big problem with
this check this out you got to see what
this stuff looks like okay and this is a
face primer okay this is supposed to go
all over your face but it is shiny oh my
goodness like seriously straight up you
will look like edward cullen or you know
whatever her chicks name is after she
turns into a vampire when you wear this
stuff luminizing no sparkly as hell yes
can you see the sparkle in that I don't
know you'll be able to see but it's like
sparkly like what what were you thinking
it so this Sally Hansen luminizing face
primer is a huge giant fail I'm not
going to throw it because it is made of
glass and I am NOT a completed yet ok
moving on to makeup products I have
mostly wins one fail
the first win is I found at nordstrom
rack they had this Stila countless color
pigments for 10 bucks each and I was
like so I ended up picking up so many of
them I had these two from my birthday
this one is in light show this one is in
finale this one finale is very very
orange so if you're not looking for a
red and orange on your eyes don't buy
this one this one is gorgeous and light
show it's got a little bit of green
yellow but it's mostly mostly blue and
then at nordstrom rack I picked up in D
which is mostly looks like a pinky's
pinky purple e ma vie kinds of colors
really really pretty and then I picked
up the melody which is a purple
lavenders Purple's gorgeous and my
favorite favorite favorite one which is
center stage and I love this one because
there's just so many stinking options in
here when you buy one of these each one
is unique you have a different amount of
each color depending on whatever
happened in your product I just love
love love these shadows and the big
reason why i love them is they are very
very blendable I'm you have all the
different color choices in there to play
what they are just fun eyeshadow toys
especially for 10 bucks at nordstrom
rack I would highly recommend you pick
at least one of these up for yourself I
did have the brown one the brown one was
nice it did the same thing as all the
others but I've so many brown eye
shadows that I just decided to take that
one back moving on to other eyes last
month I had this essence days no matter
what pen liner in my favorites now I'm
not sure if you know but Sephora now
came out with new Sephora favorites
collections which are amazing they had
an out last Christmas they might have
had him out this time last year but I
wasn't as much into this this time last
year as i was last Christmas so I picked
him up around Christmas time and their
kids where they contain many different
deluxe sized samples of items so I got
the eyeliner one and i got the lip gloss
one and in the islander want to ended up
keeping this one and the other ones are
going to be forgivable most of them and
this is the Stila stay all day
waterproof liquid eyeliner now the
reason why I'm
up the essence one is because these are
almost exactly the same I do like to
steal a one just a tad bit more
sometimes pan liners they will seep into
my fine lines neither of these do that I
do find that this one is a little it
doesn't stay as solid through the day as
the steel of one it does stay very very
well but not not as nicely as the
ceiling one also the essence one leaves
kind of a shadow behind after you take
it off where the steel of one does not
so um if you don't care if you just
really want a good pen liner don't spend
your money on the steel of one just get
the essence ones this is like four bucks
this is like 20 bucks for the full size
but if you really want I feel like this
seal of one is the absolute perfect pen
liner and I would recommend can liners
to anybody that is just stirring out
with eyeliners when I say a pen liner
let me show you what it looks like so
that's what that looks like and here's
the line that it draws I mean just so
easy to control of course I'm doing it
like not like doing it the way I would
normally do my makeup but I mean just
gorgeous absolutely gorgeous black black
black let me show you the essence one
just to compare this one actually is a
little bit softer this one's older but
this one's a little bit softer to apply
the Stila one is a little bit more firm
a little easier to apply now putting
them on side by side I would say the
seal the one is more black then the
essence 1 the seal of one definitely is
a little more firm of a tip than the
essence 1 um but I really do like both
of them I would try the essence one
first and if you feel like it's not
quite awesome enough then splurge for
the Stila let's just leave it at that Oh
going back to more eyeshadow i forgot to
show you this I got this at Whole Foods
this is a mineral fusion is the name of
the brand eyeshadow and it's i think it
was like fifteen dollars some ridiculous
but I just had I just had to have it cuz
i saw this color and i was a blue oh my
goodness it's in the shade flash and
I'll swatch that for you just the
perfect pinky brown i absolutely love
love love this color it is kind of SAT
me
it's not summer ii or sparkly it's very
satin finish and it's just a gorgeous
gorgeous all over lid color so if you
happen to run into these mineral fusion
eyeshadows they usually have them open
to test I would recommend that you on
swatch it and see if it's something
you'd be interested in but the blends
ability the staying power all of those
good things you wanted an eyeshadow i
found in this one finally for lips i'm
just going to talk about just briefly
the Milani lipsticks i'm not gonna it's
not the color it's the formula the
formula these things i just love love
love i had the one in nude cream and i
promptly lost it and i'm hoping i will
find it soon because i love that shade
this one isn't naturally chic it is
number 25 and then i got fruit punch in
number 11 and i will swatch those for
you my love's I should have worn one
today that wasn't very smart there is
naturally chic and there is fruit punch
now what I absolutely love about these
is the moisturizing factor okay for the
most part that is I think the big wit on
these is just it feels like a lip balm
going on which I've never found in a
drugstore lipstick absolutely love that
the smell they literally smell like
fruit punch nothing crazy as far as the
lasting power on these pretty typical
wear for a lipstick but I really really
just love the smell and the moisturizing
effect of these lipsticks so if you've
never tried on Milani lipstick I would
recommend picking one up in your
favorite shade nude cream really is
beautiful if you want something that's a
little more calm and fruit punch is also
very very popular now my friend Linda at
the beauty puzzle does not like Milani
lipsticks because she feels like it
sinks into her fine lines around her
lips I do not have fine lines around my
lips yet but if you do you may want to
pass on these because Linda says that
they do not work for her and I trust
Linda completely when it comes to things
like that she is amazing so for the last
product I wanted to show you is this
Urban Decay brand new lipstick what see
what are these things calm
it doesn't even say on here just says
California the new brand new formula
verb indicate lipsticks and this is in
the shade 69 and you can you're gonna be
able to tell the difference between this
and the Milani lipsticks that I just
showed you just in the swatch she don't
know baby oh which one of these is not
like the other which one of these just
doesn't belong I mean can you tell that
this is the Urban Decay one I mean holy
pigmentation Batman that is some insane
pigmentation so you know I typically
don't go for highly pigmented
pigmentation is that a word no it's not
I typically don't go for highly
pigmented lipsticks because I don't like
my lips to look painted like I feel like
it makes me look like a clown I don't
enjoy it but if you just barely touch
this on your lips it can work at least
for me you're like really pigmented lip
sticks you will probably like the new
Urban Decay formula it lasts 4ever like
it stays on your lips like forever it's
crazy but I do share it out considerably
because I just don't like it on full
strength it's just too much for me I
can't handle it alright my friends that
