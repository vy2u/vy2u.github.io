favorites video well wins and fails
favorites and flaps whatever you want to
call it for months I think the last time
I did one a true one was October so I
just decided to instead of trying to
push in like a January favorites or wait
till the end of februari to do one I
would just do a winter favorites video
because I have tried a lot of products I
just haven't I've been getting all these
subscription boxes and things and I just
haven't been able to fit it in so I'm
very happy to bring you my winter
favorite I'm gonna kind of copy off my
girl cassie over at thrift thick what
she does is she starts with the worst
products and then she works her way up
to her favorite product for that time
period so we're gonna start off with my
least favorite products I've discovered
since November but i'll start off with
these because these did absolutely
nothing these right here these are by
john frieda the frizzies formula they're
both deluxe sample size I think I got
both of them in new Beauty test tube and
neither of them did anything this one is
the straight fixation smoothing cream
and this is a three days straight for
curly hair now I have wavy hair so I
would hope that with wavy hair it would
work it did nothing this one you're
supposed to just rub it in too damp hair
and blow to blow-dry straight this one
you're supposed to spray liberally start
with damp or wet not dry hair seven
start with seven to fifteen sprays use
more or less I think it ended up like
the third time i use it i use like 30
sprays trying to get this to work no
such load these crap products very sad
about those put the next crap product i
got a bunch of stuff from rain cosmetics
i love rain cosmetics I shadows they
sell them on hautelook which is a flash
so website if you don't know who look
you totally need to get a no look lots
of wonderful deals on lots of great
companies rain is a company that I've
gotten some great things from in the
past so I want to try more things from
their line this is a little mini mascara
oh this was terrible this was terrible
my friend okay so you'll see right away
why this is a mean look at this brush
are you kidding me like if that's what
the mascara is doing to the brush
goodness knows what it will do to my
lashes I don't think the brushes I mean
maybe
supposed to be swirled like that maybe
that's on purpose I don't know I don't
think it is because I can actually
separate the bristles I mean it's just
the Colombo deist mascara formula I have
ever seen it's just goopy and it doesn't
it did it was terrible this one probably
should have been number one because this
was horrible the literally the worst
mascara i have ever tried I'm sorry
Rayna I love your eyeshadows i hated
this mascara so goodbye trash this is
the Urban Decay brow box now they might
have changed the formula on this because
I got this at marshalls and it was on
super discount i think it was like ten
dollars instead of twenty dollars or
maybe eight doll or something like that
it looks very nice it comes with a
little brush and the little the little
tweezers which i still use the tweezers
are fine and then it comes with some wax
this made me appreciate my Anastasia
powder that I have because this
basically what I feel like it did was it
almost changed the color of the skin
underneath my brows so we just ended up
looking really fake and weird I try
different combinations of the colors and
it just this did not work for me at all
so they're very soft i'll show you
swatches here and now that I'm looking
at these I may try to use these
eyeshadows because they are really
pretty and they don't blend away um but
you can see like it kind of stained my
hands and they don't blend at all so
this was a note for me but I'm gonna try
this as a shadow I haven't tried that
yet so I'll let you know about that i'll
keep you update this one's probably the
next crappiest this is the Korres this
is the yogurt like lip balm i'll put the
name of it because i can't remember
exactly what it is but this is the
weirdest product check this out look at
that look how weird that is it's got
this little ball there and then watch
the swatch like what is that what is
that even supposed to be what really
what is that how is that a functional
product so maybe this should have been
the worst product I don't know I mean
that's got a lot of really bad stuff and
usually I like stuff from Korres but
this was just the stupidest product ever
so this one is going straight into the
trash it is a junkie junkie product now
moving on to things that were
crappy for me but may work for other
people this one is the h2o face Oasis
hydrating treatment and this is I was
actually really excited to get this I
got this in a beauty box and it's like a
gel for me I'll you can see I used quite
a bit of it because I wanted to give it
a chance and see whether this was really
what the problem was I use this for
about two weeks and and about three or
four days into using it I felt a lot of
sensitivity in my skin like i used the
Neutrogena wipes the makeup remover
wipes and like it was like painful to
use them like what is going on like my
face hurts like it's killing me right oh
don't pull that joke of you that's not
nice but my name I literally made my
face hurt like I don't it was weird look
at gave me sensitivity on my skin and
I've never had before so I stopped using
it and then immediately I lost that
sensitivity so I know that it was this
product causing that for my particular
skin I do have normal skin I don't have
oily tambo dry nothing I just normal
skin and this was not a good product for
me at what I'm not going to throw quite
as hard because I didn't hate it quite
as much this is another one that I think
might work for other people and I
remember when I open this in a beauty
box a lot of you were like oh my gosh i
love that product this one is the time
for ECC anti-age color correcting cream
by luminor lumen-a and when in this
one's in medium when I first use this
when I first put it on I absolutely love
it I love the way it looks I love the
way it applies I'll show you the tones
it matches my skin tone beautifully it's
got a nice light to medium coverage
really actually I haven't used it in a
while this is more I would say this is
like a a medium coverage my solid medium
coverage like the problem with this for
me again I have normal skin is that it
actually broke up on my face as the day
went on like I would look at my I put it
on maybe eight o'clock in the morning
and I would look at my face at maybe
four o'clock and it would just look like
it had just broken up on my face like
the texture of my skin looked cracked
almost and I was really sad because the
initial application is absolutely
gorgeous but this did not work for me at
all and i have used this but if any of
you are interested in this I feel like
the product is protected enough inside
that I would be willing to pass this on
to you if you would like it so if you
want would
to try this i am telling you i have used
it maybe three or four times including
what i just did they go ahead and put in
the comments that you're interested in
the CC anti-age color correcting cream
and in the first 24 hours that this
video is live I will accept people that
would like to try it after the 24 hours
are over then I will be picking a winner
of my used product and its really i
don't know if that offends some people
that i would give this away but if you
feel like this is something because i
have squirted some of the product out if
this is not something you would want to
try then just don't enter for it but i
have a feeling that some people may want
to try this or may enjoy this product
and again this is in the color medium
and it is the color correcting cream so
that can be for you so on to some
products that i have been absolutely
loving this winter and first one i want
to tell you about is this speckle tinted
under makeup primer in a wreath roll by
laura geller on hautelook they had a
laura geller and i bought a bunch of
stuff from them i actually have my
favorite product that i've discovered
this winter is also by laura geller but
i wanted to mention this one as well I
was a little scared of this at first
because it is called urethral and it is
supposed to be slightly aluminized and I
personally have a preference for a very
matte look but I'm telling you this is
not over alumini illuminating it does
not overdo it i will show you swatch
that is the little dollop and then
spreading that out and it is a very wet
feeling you can see it is a bit shiny
but as it dries it just gives a tad tad
bit of a glow and honestly i just really
love the way this makes my makeup look
my mad nigga i never thought that i
would enjoy a product like this but I'm
very pleasantly surprised by this so
this is going into my favorites for
which speaking of face products I have
mentioned this in a couple videos
recently and this is my Real Techniques
Beauty Blender dupe I love this thing
it's amazing it is so soft I just want
to smash it on my face all of the time
those of you that have this you know
what I'm talking about is so stinkin
soft and honestly for seven dollars this
is way way
way way way better deal than the
Beautyblender I feel like it works
slightly better I feel like it is softer
I love the shape if the shape is very
functional to get the under eyes here
and then the flat part is what I used
you pat on my foundation it's magical
and amazing and totally worth seven
bucks next up I have some products by
company called Camille Beckman Camille
Beckman a representative contacted me
after they saw a new Beauty test tube
video of mine and she said she want to
send me some things because I had really
liked the hand cream and my first
impression of it and I actually have it
in my desk at work I don't have it with
me it's like my my desk lotion so then I
have something in my desk so I don't
have it with me but she sent me this
cute little sampler pack isn't that
adorable and it's all different body
butter type things in each little pot I
don't know if they sell this as a set
but each of these is sold individually
in different products she also sent me
this lip balm and I really love this lip
balm it is a cocoa butter blip bomb
actually the number one ingredient in
this is actually almond butter but it
smells like cocoa butter my only thing
it's very really smells like chocolate
would it comes down to and it's called
kiss me and it's it's amazing my only
thing about this is you have to be
really really gentle when you put in
your lips this is not you know regular
chapstick you if you smash on your lips
you're gonna end up way too much product
so you just have to kind of be gentle
with it but it's got that really really
nice like cocoa chocolate smell and it's
really moisturizing and I love this and
then these I like most of these so I'm
just going to go through them really
quickly for you the first one here is
called midnight monarch and this one is
okay i'll put the notes over here so you
know what's what that what they say the
notes are but what i don't like as much
about this one is the patchouli
undertone that I can smell in it but it
does have like a sweetness to it it's
really nice it's a it's a nice smell if
you can handle it a little bit of
patchouli smell in there it's not bad
it's just not my favorite in here this
one here is actually my favorite this
one's called mango Beach number two and
that's exactly what it smells like it
smells like okay like you just got done
hanging out the beach and you're all
like
d so you go home you take a shower get
ready for your night out and then this
is what you put on like it just smells
so good and it's like half gone because
I had it my jacket pocket it's like
mango coconut eb cheese smelling with
wonderfulness the next one is also one
that I really like it's called Tuscan
honey this one is a little bit more
floral but it's got that honey undertone
to it and it smells really nice this
one's but reminds me more of like a
spring scent really like that one and as
far as the formula of these I like the
formula because it I it's a little
greasy at first like a body butter but
then it seeps in really nice and it just
moisturizes so well the next one is
french vanilla is exactly the way that
you would imagine french vanilla would
be it's just smells like french vanilla
creaming cupcaking goodness and i love
it and then this one here is also really
nice it's called Marella monarch this
one actually you know what this one is
the one that's like a little bit citrusy
and floral it's okay this one again
isn't my favorite but I can see where
where a lot of people would really like
this one it's got another way creaminess
to it but the floor illness isn't quite
I don't know I do like it it's just
again like the other monarch juan not my
favorite but smells really good now this
one is the only one that i did not
straight up did not like and this one's
actually called Camille and how can I
put this I think I'm a little too young
for this song it's very floral very
floral like mm-hmm don't like that one
really really loving these they're very
moisturizing I'm just a really nice body
butter texture love love love loving
these and love love love loving this
another thing that I want to tell you
about which I was very pleasantly
surprised about I got this in a birchbox
and this is the Tony and I London salon
heat protection missed I gotten so many
compliments on my hair since i've been
using this i feel like it tames my
flyaways along with being a good heat
protection mist and before this that 21
benefits one that i actually got into
Birchbox also was we had become my holy
grail well not my holy grail but one
that i was really using a lot that I was
really enjoying but i think this even
tops it i really enjoy this i don't
think i will end up purchasing a full
size of it just because i'm always
trying new
means but if I were to you know mean a
new heat protection missed that you know
if I happen to run out somehow from my
sample boxes and all this would be
something I would consider purchasing I
really really like it smells very
fruiting like fruity fruity like fruit
punchy smells really good i really like
it and you can see the mist Wow the
mists is very manageable it's not like
crazy you know like it's it's it's a
nice myst so definitely recommend this
one really like it left on estas y'all
did bro I have seriously been loving
this I've used quite a bit this one is
in chocolate I did use this in today in
the tutorial I did for this look really
love this you do have to be very gentle
very careful with it because if you use
what you'll see if you go back and watch
the tutorial I didn't skip through until
you get to the eyebrow part you'll see
how I applied it I plant with a very
thick like I'm not fluffy brush but like
a more like dense brush instead of with
the thin kind and then i pad it in but
you'll see it go back and watch this
tutorial if you want to see how I
applied it but you got to be really
careful this it's hard to make it a
natural look unless you practice with it
a little bit but overall I'm really
really loving this stays on all day just
a beautiful effect I love the way it
makes my brows look because I have these
horrible spaces which you can see in
that video too and this really fills the
man very naturally now that I've
practiced with it a bit in the last two
products or cheek products I've been
loving my Bahama Mama by the bomb love
this this is kind of taken over for my
hoola bronzer hey I do have yellow
undertones in my skin so it looks really
nice with that you can see I mean this
is this can get very very dark so if
you're medium skin tone this would be
really really nice maybe even like a
light deep this might look nice but yeah
just really loving this it's just such a
nice product it's very creamy you do
have to use a very light hand because it
is so pigmented and we'll powder up if
you used to dance with a brush you got
to use a really fluffy brush for them
and the last product which has been my
favorite discovery of this winter has
been the laura geller arethe roll Rose
said teen subtle berry blush and this is
a baked blush and I absolutely love this
I don't know why I slept on these
products for so long
so so pretty let me zoom me so there's
that and then I'll show you the swatch
just beautiful and you can see the
marbling in here is just absolutely
gorgeous this is another product that
you have to use like a very fluffy brush
because it does powder up if you use to
dance of a brush but really loving this
product a lot I did get some other Laura
Geller products but I didn't want to
load up this video with too much so I
just want to stick to the things that
we're in here but I do have some more
Laura Geller stuff I want to tell you
about but this was definitely the
standout product of products that I used
from what I got from laura geller so
wanted to mention that to you that's it
