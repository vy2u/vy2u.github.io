I'm Jen and this is your Daily Makeup
Minute for May 29, 2018.
Huda is teasing that something is coming next
week...wonder what?
Have you heard of Meesha Lou cosmetics? Their
tagline is &quot;be a unique freak&quot; and their palettes
are based on fantasy characters and creatures
you see in films and books like Fawns, Witches
and Queen Bees.
Nabla sends a a closer look at the upcoming
CLOSE-UP line: Close-Up Baking &amp;amp; Setting Powder
and its Powder Brush. Stay tuned to discover
the rest of the squad!
CoverGirl is launching some new TruNaked palettes
including this one that smells like chocolate.
Seems like there will also be a peach scented
palette called Peach Punch. They also posted
this photo of one called Dazed…We wonder
what that one would smell like!
And finally, what's new from Notoriously Morbid?
Two new Fearless Fragments face and body glitters,
two new Diablo lip rouges, and their brand
new Poxy Tonic are up on the site! How can
you not be curious about something named Poxy
Tonic?
That’s it for now. We'll see you here same
time tomorrow! Look for Makeup Minute Extras
on my Instagram, and don't forget our full-length
weekly newscast, What's Up in Makeup, every
Sunday morning on YouTube!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
