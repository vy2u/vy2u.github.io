hello my friends welcome to the final
day of our IMATS vlog so excited we are
well first of all to tell you I'm
wearing a lip thing that I got at the
thing where's my lipstick I was gonna
have it in the video well you tell them
what we're doing today while I go get my
lip product it's over on the vanity I
know you just come so we are about to go
downstairs and get some breakfast at our
awesome hotel restaurant it's called the
the hotel that we're staying in I think
we already told you is Inc 48 hour
breakfast there yesterday was amazing so
we're gonna do that again and then we
are going to Sephora at like 86 and
Lexington for there vib Rouge event I'm
gonna try to keep Jennifer from spending
a ton of money my makeup
he's so yes so I'm sorry what happened
we'll see what happens I'm gonna try not
to buy more lip products
there's no I love my lip product he does
balms and my butters and my scrubs he's
got nice lips though so what I'm wearing
is the LA girl matte flat finish pigment
gloss and this is doesn't oh in the
shade Bazaar that's what's going on
there and then on my toes I painted my
nails with this Everglades extended wear
nail polish that I got and I'm excited
about that
put it on my toes my video shoe she done
can't say boy alright so we'll see you
at the vib rouge events yay John I are
at the restaurant and he ordered the
same thing he ordered yesterday and he
asked for sausage and we realized that
it did he come with the sausage but
yesterday he thought it did come with
the sausage and we realize that there's
a big difference between the phrases
would you like bacon or sausage or would
you like bacon or sausage and I think
that they said would you like bacon or
sausage and he thought it came with it
but it didn't but isn't that interesting
how could be the exact same words but
any different intonation just it's just
a little rare not for you
and if you are not aware of the uber
universe is pretty epic especially in
New York City now you pers goober is
awesome so you got you downloaded the
uber app on your phone you put your
credit card information in there so it's
already stored so you can get a ride
anywhere you don't have to worry about
having cash or anything like that you
just put your desk you put where you
want them to pick you up
you put the destination and then it
shows you on the app the little car
coming to pick you up what time it's
going to be there and then they pick you
up and then you can even keep the app
open while you're there and it kind of
shows a little car driving the the route
and your estimated arrival time we've
used it the whole time we've been in New
York has been really convenient so you
know it's easy to hail a taxi around
here too but it's just kind of nice to
be able to have a nap you don't have to
add a gratuity on top of it because it's
already included in it so it's really
nice and easy way to get around so I got
a referral code from my friend who used
it so our first ride was actually free
which is awesome so if you guys are
interested in that we can put our code
below you can check that out or you can
just download the app if we just want to
tell you that thanks I think it's pretty
cool so good well there's nothing really
that cool right here it's just like
buildings and stuff like not exciting
where we're at right now but you know
it's all good so let's see
you
so we are at the VIP huge event at
Lexington and and just talked to the DA
right from Keene and Austin and they
have a miracle which results are
comparable to 30 percent like colic acid
facial peels
and then they have a bunch of different
services by a more inclusive
vo benefit fight beauty
all kinds of cool stuff in here so the
funny thing is is that
- one of the ladies and I have two about
one of the services there
and she immediately turned to Jennifer
and told her all about and I'm like what
happened did I disappear okay come on
give me a break my breath yeah I guess
in my rather better some photos my
eyebrows my usual work
talk to the man you know damn question
judgment or supposed to be judgment free
right killing you
the selfie powders see that's not
impressive to me I like the middle one
look at that I'm not I'm not impressed
with that I mean maybe it's cuz people
put their oily fingers in here too much
but oh no I don't know about that
it's my favorite spot it's the Kat Von D
section oh that's my favorite I think I
might pick me up one of these babies
is that the contour that's the i1
where's the regular contour one no they
don't even have the palate out I want to
put my fingers in it I want you to touch
it
I don't even see the regular contour
palette must be someplace else they hid
it from me
all right the tartlet palette I've never
swatched this it was sold out and I'm at
yesterday
feels good they feel nice it feels
supersoft look at that pigmentation whoo
nice oh my gosh that's pretty Oh
love it love it Bobby Brown's hot news
it's very sparkly I wasn't expecting it
to be this sparkly
a shimmer
Matt actually it looks nice not super
impressive it's nice
two-faced soulmates bronzer and blush
the bronzer looks nice but the blush I
can see would just kind of disappear I
can't get a good swatch without almost
knocking it over but I can see the blush
would be a little bit hard to work with
my nemesis Pacolet so it's hard to see
but the bronze or it looks like would be
a nice bronzer but I don't know about
that blush all right Urban Decay sheer
revolution
Gary here and revolutionary I guess
sheer obsessed I thought you said that I
could get the footage of rooms
you have to get pretty first yes
all right so the guy the manager at
Sephora was a jerk and he told me I
could get my footage approved and then
he came over and yelled at me for
filming you told me I could get the
footage of proof why I told you you
couldn't um no you did not tell me I
couldn't film you told me I could get
the footage approved and what he meant
was is to call the person first and then
get it approved before I come in but
that is not what he said so he starts
yelling at me and it's like you know
what dude like you're the one who
miscommunicated don't yell at me that
just makes me angry so I don't know I
don't know what I'm gonna do as far as
the footage you don't know what I did as
far as the footage at this point because
y'all have already seen it but I'm just
a little irritated and then we get up to
the counter and the chick behind the
register just she must have been new or
something she's having all kinds issues
getting us like you know yeah you will
yeah we both got the IB Rouge bags so I
find out for beauty insider and this is
what they gave me as a gift give me some
Mars lipstick she's like when's your
birthday and he's like June and she
hands him the birthday gift
so he's like it's April I something's
going on in that store man like that's
the why that was the only one in all of
New York City that still had spaces
available they're just crazy in there or
something I don't know but but anyway I
don't know that was that was our time
that was not as far as I thought it was
gonna be but then I forgot this cute
little folder okay yeah well we're gonna
put it all why don't we do a little so
what we got when we get back like from
in like the hotel lobby or something
we'll show them all we got
but that was just our time at the Rouge
event I was not that was not epic if you
didn't go to the Rouge event and
specifically the one at yo yeah and the
shading like contour palette that I was
gonna get was sold out and they soon as
I said all I just don't like oats or
what out online to okay so not online to
like okay I mean you'd think that they
would want us to promote their stuff I'm
not asking for money I'm just asking to
show their stuff like I I don't I don't
get why people don't want me to
advertise for them for free like how
does that even make any sense
I don't know I mean you think about how
many y'all go and shop there because of
what's up and makeup brilliant Julie it
makes me mad but you know all right
enough eventing it's two in almost three
minutes in of me complaining so I'm at a
youtuber drama yesterday oh yeah that's
true yeah well I'm sure if you don't
follow any of those people but I don't I
don't follow a lot of big names so I
wasn't privy to the information other
than what people that I'm us were
telling me but Jeffrey star and jeffree
star the other stars
Patrick starts to be stars fanny an emu
a make up in you and who were the girls
Nicole but they all got kicked out
because I mats is trying to I'm Max is
trying to make it less of a YouTube
event and more of a makeup professionals
event that the youtubers there that were
big names were causing too much of a
ruckus with people following them around
they weren't doing meet-and-greets
because they felt like people well at
least this is according to the the bugs
is that people we're buying tickets
IMATS in order to meet people and they
weren't actually buying makeup so people
that wanted to buy makeup couldn't get
tickets because people were just going
to go meet the YouTube people it kind of
makes sense but it's like if you already
know that you're selling out the event
and that there's a demand for meet and
greets to get a bigger venue sell more
tickets
you know sell food or whatever you know
like there's so much there's so much
opportunity there absolutely maybe
they'll do that next year because it
seems like this wasn't a problem last
year and I'm sure that they're gonna
have to do something to address it for
next year right there's a lot of people
were saying that if that's the case that
they're not even gonna come to the event
next year and that's why people come to
the events because these are the people
that are promoting the product so it's
like yeah I mean it's like think about
how many people are by makeup products
because of their videos you know what
I'm saying like it's just it's there's
just a backward thing going on and I
think that it's wrong you know they're
dubbing of the YouTube community I think
that it's dumb you know because it's
because of YouTube that people are so
makeup crazy right now I really truly
believe that like that the everyday
person is so makeup crazy
always a lot of us maybe not everybody
but a lot of people so I just think then
it's not stop I think they'll work it
out nope they are but then there are you
know specific meet-and-greet County
conventions like the one you're going to
later on this year
yep see one yeah so you know I don't
know I'm just gonna be like you guys go
do that and they'll be any more I've
asked to be more of like a pro event you
know who knows there's a lot of money
you never know they're gonna lose a lot
visible you think about your pro day
there are a lot less people there on a
pro day yeah there are on a regular day
I think still people will go
you know but maybe it just I'd be
curious to know what their what their
ticket sales were five years ago
compared to now four I'm nuts I'd be
curious to see how much it's increased
yeah and I wonder whether that would be
because of YouTube videos you know them
not allowing that to happen
you never know you never know what'll
happen next year it might just be like a
growing pain for the for the event that
they'll work through it was a good idea
to talk about that babe yeah here you go
now you know you weren't there you're in
the know yeah and then oh all right so
we're gonna go ahead and go back and
check out at the hotel and then we'll
show you our Sephora swag maybe in the
lobby of the hotel show you what we got
in our VIP rooms bags all right so this
is the VIP Rouge bag that we've got I
have open mind John speaking in his and
uber on the way back I have not looked
in mine yet so get first impression see
whether it was worth getting yelled at
in the store okay so looks like this I
like the little fold-over style very
nice and let's see this is benefit puff
off there we go and then it's got the
crazy claims on the bag 94% said I area
looks smooth customer panel survey of
thirty-one women after seven days where
do they find these women I don't know
are they benefit friends and family we
don't know so I never take this claim
seriously but puff off very nice and
then next is the nude prejudice Omega
treatment milk little baby sample and
the caveat repair X instant recovery
shampoo with strand building proteins
and then the conditioner as well well
pack there and then this is Daisy dream
by Marc Jacobs which is an amazing
and it's so beautiful the packaging on
that one that's not yeah I'm not that's
great right now but I know it smells
good and then this is this is nice this
is the buxom full-on lip cream and there
is that I will swatch it is for today so
there we go let's see how it take it is
not glossy but that's okay it's got a
vanilla scent very very strong vanilla
scent that's nice very happy to have
that that's a nice little pocket gloss
and then this is the Shiseido
Ultem eun power infusing concentrate I
applied morning and evening after
cleansing and balancing skin of wait
contacted us and then the last thing in
here is a Sephora formula X and nail
polish excited to have that I really do
like formula accent nail polishes for
the most part and the color is paramount
and it looks like it's kind of a muddy
green I think that's different from the
color I got brownish kind of color
doesn't like there's any shimmer in it
it looks like it's a cream so but that's
cool I'm excited to have it that's a
really nice base for nail art so very
very happy and excited to have that so
cool that was everything that was in my
bag that all the same stuff okay and
that's the same that's the same oh you
got a different Daisy you got the
original Daisy are you recording yeah
yeah okay you got the original Daisy and
that's the same and let's see your lip
can you do it and yours with seal of
mine was it my just open rag up yours is
that's the same same one I got and then
that's the same and then your nail
polish is in quantum and yours is pretty
here's well yours is a cream too yeah
but it's just a little slightly my
friend these probably aren't super
popular shades that's probably why they
gave them away but yeah you can tell
there's a subtle difference this one's
more green this one's more brown but
still very exciting they're like
nobody's buying this stuff can we just
like throw it in those bags let's just
give our way to the roaches they'll
they use everything they don't care they
just want product pages my products so
yeah so that's what was in the div Rouge
bags wouldn't giving you now baby I
don't know we got check out of here so
we'll check our bags down in the lobby
and then we'll find something fun to get
into
