friend oh hello my friends welcome to my
boxes Shawn March review and April
unboxing his thing and telling you what
I got in April box I am excited to
review boxy charm for you this month oh
my goodness lots of good stuff going on
so what I do i do box openings a little
bit different I don't do it like a hall
I do it like a review and then a halt so
I'm gonna show you what I got in my
March box review it all for you because
I'm using most of the products for about
a month and then I have down for you
showing you what i got in april whole
style and then next month i'll review it
for you before I go into the review I
want to let you know that I am sent boxy
charm as a free box in order to review
it on my channel but as always that does
not influence my review I am not afraid
of being honest with boxy charm Thank
You boxy charm for loving me just the
way I am now let's go ahead into the
March box and show you what I got now
I'm going to start with the one product
that I only had a chance to use once I
just filmed right before this I'm not
sure if it's gonna go live before this
video after this video but a sponsor
video for polished toys skincare so i
used this I think once or twice before I
started the polished choice regimen but
i could not mix this in so i did not
give this a fair shot i will tell you
that this eye cream was very nice the
two times than i used it seed into the
skin very nicely not a strong scent very
much enjoyed it it looks like a giant
bottle and a couple you were tell me Jen
looks like a giant bottle but it's not
giant this is actually a point five
fluid ounce so if you think about with a
full-size foundation it's about half the
size of full-size foundation still in
decent size for eye cream but definitely
not huge by any means so unfortunately I
cannot give this a full review but first
impressions of it pretty good now moving
on to the Catherine Malandrino style D
Peri perfume this is a very nice
smelling perfume it is my perfect
perfect sent for me which is a nice
balance between fruity and full
or roll and it sprays out like this yes
very nice missed my only complain about
this is the lasting power is not so
great only last on me an hour or two
before I have to reapply it's more of
like a body spray to me than a perfume
as far as the potency of it but the
scent is very very pleasant I'm smelling
it right now smells super nice but I
wish it lasted just a little bit longer
it's not that hard to throw this in your
purse and spray it on more though but
swish it lasted a little longer I was
sad about that next up we got a very
used and loved makeup brush I got the
vasanti makeup brush didn't see anybody
else they got of a salty makeup brush
that did the unboxings so I was very
very happy to get this now this is a
very very versatile brush I didn't say
the number on it and this was the month
the boxy charm did not include any
products on the back so I'm not sure of
the number but it's this fluffy powder
brush well you could use this I've used
this for blush I've used it for
contouring I've used it for all over
face powder like it's a really nice just
universal brush I also like the really
nice long handle on it if I can figure
out what brush this is I will put it in
the description below but there's no
number anything on it but it's a very
nice brush really enjoyed using this it
is quite synthetic feeling of but it's
not scratching it anyway it's very soft
very nice brush really enjoyed that and
then I got the this is something I
forgot to mention in my last video this
is the jela tantalizing taupe eyebrow
color now I have used this product many
times before I think I got in a
subscription box years ago went through
it used it all loved it i'm going to
swatch it here for you very very fine
point very easy on this product to get
those hairlike strokes if you do that on
your eyebrows and you want to get those
hairlike strokes very easy to do here
it's very thin feels very good to use
because you all know i like to compare
things we're going to compare it to the
loreal brow stylist the finer and the
auto stores your brow wiz just to show
you the different points OOP that is a
spoolie that's not going to work let's
try the other side gen so I'm going to
hold that up for you so you can see the
three different points is a choke from
chela next up is the loreal brow definer
and dark brown
this is the Anasazi up brow Wiz in dark
brown so that's how those all very very
nice products I use them interchangeably
I do feel like the cella is a little bit
harder to apply it takes a little bit
more work than the L'Oreal and the
Anasazi of the Loreal if you have not
tried this girlfriend mmm this isn't
about the l'oreal but I just have to
mention it because every time I show
this thing I have to tell you this is
amazing 10 bucks twenty bucks I don't
know how much this thing is but I will
get to L'Oreal that's just me but the
cella is a nice brow pencil I do really
like it it's just it's a little bit not
quite as creamy to apply as these now
for all shadow we got to makeup geek
eyeshadows I got one in cocoa bear and
one in black light which is duochrome
now cocoa bear is fantastic it lives up
to the hype my friend i have heard such
good things about cocoa bear and I'm so
thankful to have gotten it I've use it
in my crease numerous times and it is
just a beautiful beautiful shade there
we go nice big ol swatch there for you
really really really gorgeous now black
light on the other hand on the black one
black light was beautiful to go on did
not last on me I used it quite a few
times I probably use it three or four
times I don't know if that's considered
quite a few but I think I used it three
times and it goes on beautifully you can
see that shift there it's gorgeous but
by the end of the day girl friend is
gone and it makes me sad because it is
so beautiful and the formula is so nice
to go on but it just didn't have a
lasting power for me and I use it with
multiple different eyeshadow primer as I
use it with my Urban Decay I use it with
a couple of other ones and just was not
impressive as far as the staying power
but gorgeous application if you're
looking for Instagram pictures you're
looking to go to some place just for a
few hours yes all day no so that was the
April box so overall I do definitely
feel like this was worth twenty dollars
i mean just just in the two eyeshadows
even without the duochrome lasting
forever love that I'm
I got to try this perfume I probably
wouldn't have purchased this but since
it was in here yes the vasanti brush
this is definitely worth at least ten
bucks on its own and then I'm really
happy with the eyebrow product as well
of course this is going to be at least
ten dollars so the eye cream I did like
it for the two times i used it i just
wish i could give a full review but i
can so there wasn't a dud in this box
there are things that I could like
better but there was no dud so that
makes me super happy well done boxy
charm let's go ahead and move on and
show you what I got in my eight burst of
all I still equipped golf clap round of
applause too boxy charm for bringing
back the description on the back of the
card Thank You Bugsy job oh my gosh i
love you i saw the description on the
back I was like yes score i'm so happy
so happy last month they didn't put the
description on there this back of this
card is so incredibly helpful they give
you the product they tell you whether
it's a full size or sample size they
tell you the price they give you a
description they give you a how-to it is
probably one of the most helpful cards
in all of subscription boxes and they've
brought it back thank you so much so in
this box i got five products and i don't
i didn't see any unboxings of this so i
don't know if everybody got the same or
some people got different but this is
what i got the first thing i got is this
full-size Anderson Lily manhattan beach
beach butter hand cream and the
full-size price of this is twenty-four
dollars holy moly for a hand cream whoo
oh the scent is really really strong by
the way like super strong so just be
aware of that i will fully review this
next month I'm not gonna do anything
else I'm just showing you really hard
time not revealing but we're gonna hold
back we're gonna hold back next thing
was this pure least daily lip north
shore with mango and shea butter I was
really surprised to see a lip product
from purely so I didn't realize they did
lip product so that was kind of exciting
so I'm interested in playing with that
more as I drop it it did come in this
little boxee box but I pulled a pur
Lisse is a full-size this is worth
sixteen dollars oh this here is your
minerals Sweden and this is
Brown hypnotic it is an eye shadow this
here is the full size and it's $21 and I
just watch it it's really pretty ok I'll
swatch it I can't stop I can't stop
reviewing can't do it it's so pretty
though I've not used on my eyes yet the
brown with like peach glitter in it it's
so pretty like bronzy brown with peach
glitter look how pretty that is so
pretty oh my gosh so excited about that
and now I'm a mess alright moving on
very excited about this the blink black
lash primer I haven't even opened the
 we got another blank mascara in a
previous boxy charm oh my gosh fell in
love with to me mascara if you'll never
try to the mascara especially if you
wear contacts or sensitive eyes oh my
gosh so for you it is one of those can I
open all right anyway packaging fail
okay if you never tried shaving mascara
what you do is when you wash it off it
like you put warm water on your face and
just like melts off your lashes but it
does not flake at least on me during the
day I heard people with watery eye lids
I hope you with watery eyes it did flake
on them but for me and my not watery
eyes it did not flake on me so I'm
really excited to try the black lash
primer let's go ahead and just look at
the wand real quicks I'm curious oh
that's weird weird wand very weird but
we'll see we'll see what happens i don't
really get that it's like a curved
banana looking shape but we'll try it
we'll try it i'm very still very anxious
to try it and then this is not a full
size i do not believe this is the oprah
it says that it's a full size that's so
weird did they change the packaging that
much hold on okay so i went and gotten
over a liquid lipstick because this just
look really small to me this is the old
sighs and then this is the new sighs
look at 0 for a change in the size so i
looked at the lip gloss I don't know why
they didn't put it in the lip gloss
packaging because at least it looks like
it's bigger cuz it's longer this is 0
point 8 ounces no this is a crane
and this is 8 grams I don't know how
much this is I mean it's possible that
somehow they put the same amount of
product in there but if you like if you
look at the bottoms the bottoms are the
same size that way and they're
definitely shorter I think that they
lowered the amount that's in them which
makes me really sad because they didn't
lower the prices and I'm sure they're
making more money now than they were
before come on Oprah oh well but anyway
so one thing I have to do a safe found a
positive about this is pasadena happens
to be my favorite shade of liquid
lipstick from Oprah so I'm really
excited they were putting these in the
box this is a beautiful beautiful shade
over liquid lipsticks are my favorite
liquid lipstick formula so good on you
putting these in the box of charms
they're super fab so so far it does seem
like this box is going to be worth the
$21 subscription price to me so we've
got the blank mascara lash primer which
I'm very excited to try the Pasadena lip
gloss from Oprah very excited about that
I'm very excited to try this mineral
eyeshadow it looks absolutely gorgeous
even just these three products alone I
feel like to me are worth $21 and then
we you also got the full-size lotion
that's supposedly like super duper fancy
its water based and shea butter based so
if you don't like shea butter you won't
like this but and then the lip balm so
you know I mean I think this is a good
box so far I don't like to try things
more so make sure you hit that subscribe
