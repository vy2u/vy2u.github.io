made me feel like some kind of robot
monster hello my friends welcome to my
boxy charm a review of the februari box
and showing you what I got in my march
box now the typical subscription box
unboxing video is just showing you what
we got in the box but on this channel I
also review the previous month's box
I've been using these products for a
month and I want to tell you what I
think of them after trying them for an
entire month that way if you're not a
boxy charm subscriber you'll be able to
know whether these are products you
might want to purchase on your own or if
you're thinking about subscribing to
boxy charm maybe this will give you an
idea of whether this box is truly worth
$21 to you I do want to let you know
that I do receive this box as a
subscription to review from boxy charm
which means that i do not pay for it but
I that does not influence my review at
all as you will see soon boxy charm has
always been okay with my honesty which
makes me love boxy charm even more it
says a lot about them as a brand that
they're okay with honesty so that's what
I give them so that's what I'm going to
give to you with let's go ahead and jump
into that februari box the first thing I
want to show you is this this is a
dropping things this is the sponge L you
have my heart on a string full sizea a
spongy pronto when you squeeze it the
soap comes out and I've used this about
seven or eight times and still has quite
a bit of soap in it now when I first got
this the exfoliating side was a little
too rough for me so I used it kind of on
the lower part of my legs on my back
places like that where I could handle a
little more roughness the more i use it
the less rough it gets and then i just
used the soft side for the rest of my
body but i did enjoy this concept the
only thing is i do not enjoy the smell
of the soap the soap smells horrible to
me I don't know what it is about the
scent I don't know if they all smell
like this but it just smells like really
old rotten flowers to me it smells
disgusting I don't like it at all it
just is gross
to me and I probably won't use it
anymore but I love the idea and the
concept if they could just get a good
smelling soap in there I would be
totally so I like that I did like for
the most part with this beauty for real
a blush and highlight duo so we've got
coral crush on one side on the other
side we have high beam if you can use
this right it's actually a really nice
product with really good lasting power
but the problem is is it's very easy to
over blend when I've used with this with
a brush either either side with a brush
it just blends right away it's
non-existent but if I use it with a
stippling brush it will stay on nicely
um if I use my fingers if I it's easy to
over blend but if you just Pat it until
it goes on to the opacity you like it
will work nicely it's just kind of
difficult to work with but it I mean it
works and it'll last all day but it's
just it's too high maintenance of a
product for me I want it to be able to
go on I don't have to think about it as
it goes on so it's kind of a man another
one that was pretty good for me as the
Oprah banana powder banana powder is a
brightening product it's supposed to
brighten your under-eyes specifically at
any kind of darkness that you have
discoloration purpley discolorations
supposed to counteract that I do like to
offer included this little spongy ring
here to hold this which is just
absolutely genius i love the people over
at Oprah they're just wonderful people
an opportunity to meet them at
generation beauty just really nice
people so I do appreciate they put that
in here this product was not a
standalone product for me it needed a
concealer and then this on top gave a
nice brightening effect but this was not
any kind of concealer on its own it
didn't cover the darkness on its own but
it was a nice compliment to my concealer
so I will continue to use it as that as
a brightening powder I did not like it
as an eyeshadow I didn't think it was
opaque enough but I did like it as a
brightening powder but you know it's
just kind of an okay product for me you
know nothing to go oh my goodness you
have to buy this but I am happy to have
it just not you know like wow you know I
mean another product I was not wowing
out is this freeze 24-7 anti-aging eye
serum I use this for about two weeks did
not see any effects with it maybe I
needed to use it longer I don't know but
didn't see any effects with this and the
full size of this actually the sample
size of this is $58 so it better be some
magic if it's $58 and it just wasn't
magical if it was you know just
something to moisturize and sure but if
it's supposed to be really anti aging I
didn't see those effects in those two
weeks that I use another product in here
with this very very cute sheet mask in
this very very cute packaging there's a
little um there's little message inside
there's a little postcard on the back I
mean just the most adorable packaging
you've ever seen in a face mask it's a
little creepy to go on it kind of made
me feel like some kind of robot monster
when I put it on and you know just just
kind of creepy and it felt very gross to
me and i did not enjoy it but i don't
enjoy most basement sheet masks I didn't
see any effects after one use um it just
wasn't a thing for me personally if you
just enjoy the feeling of sheet mask
then maybe you'll like this one but I
didn't see any effects or anything so
yeah cute packaging though really cute
package the last thing in here was this
real tree rollerball sighs perfume it is
a spray I didn't enjoy the sense of this
either unfortunately it was a little bit
mature for me a lot of flowers going on
in here a little bit of sweetness but a
lot of flowers and just she wasn't a
scent that I prefer I like things a
little bit sweeter than this so that's
just me personally I can see why
somebody would love this I personally
did not love it it's just not my
personal taste so I mean really there's
nothing in here that I'm super excited
about and that makes me sad the closest
things thumbs up to being excited are
the blush stick from Beauty for real and
the ofra banana powder I feel like these
two by themselves are probably worth $21
to me but it's barely and I'm used to
Boxxy Trump's knocking it out of the
park you know like me so boxy charm just
being amazing you know it's like almost
like when you're in love with somebody
you expect them to be amazing like all
the time and when they're just okay it's
like no you know like
you can do better than that so I mean
yeah it's worth $21 but they can do
better they can do better so speaking of
doing better let's go ahead and put
februari aside cuz februari is all done
and let's show you what we got in the
more attention before these will all be
reviewed for you next month so i'll show
you we got the clarks botanical anti
puff eye cream this is ginormous for an
eye cream it is huge I I would imagine
that this would be better for the whole
face I mean this is huge huge what's up
with that um let me see how it pumps out
I haven't even used it yet Oh is a cream
it's a cream and it comes out a lot so I
would imagine this will go further than
my eyes most likely unless I can barely
get something out of it um but yeah okay
uh oh one thing I wanted a critique boxy
drum what's up with not putting the
products on the back anymore i am not a
fan of that like I complain about that
about it see all the time they don't put
the products in the back like this is
not a good move for me like you know
what I would appreciate if you would do
if you would put down on the comments
belt down below if this bothers you that
they don't put the products on there or
if you don't care because I know boxy
charm watches these videos so I know
they would really appreciate the
feedback on this but this advertisement
on the back does not make me feel happy
at all I like the products that was loud
I like the products on the back so
that's my feedback that that I'm not a
fan of but I am looking forward to
trying this I Prine tell you that I also
got a vasanti brush I really like
vasanti brushes so I'm excited to try
that as well we got a Catherine
Malandrino style Paris perfume and I
have not smelled this yet I will take it
out it's gonna spray it in the air i
already have perfume on so I don't want
to spray it on my skin maybe a little
fruity yeah maybe that's a maybe we'll
see we'll try it out we'll see and then
we got to make up each eye shadows now
one thing I wanted to mention too is it
typically boxy charm you get everybody
gets pretty much the same thing this
month they really varied it a lot and
some people got do a chrome makeup II I
shadows and some didn't I was lucky I
thought a duochrome I was really excited
about it this one is in black
it's a purple and blue duochrome and
then i also got poco bear Coco bears
named after Marlena who created makeup
geek is named after her husband and I've
always heard great things about cocoa
bear i have used them both but i'm going
to wait to use them a few more times
before i give you a full review on these
