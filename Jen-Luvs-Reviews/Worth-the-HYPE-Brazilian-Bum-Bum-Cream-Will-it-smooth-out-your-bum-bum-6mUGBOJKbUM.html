the Brazilian bum bum cream it's just
fun to say Brazilian bum bum cream when
I first saw this on the shelf at Sephora
I was like what the world is that it is
made by a brand called I hope I don't
butcher this soul Gennaro
Gennaro I hope I said that right Soulja
narrow it is born in Brazil according to
the packaging I first saw this in a
review on Tottie's channel which is one
of my favorite channels and she
absolutely loved it
so I was on octoly which is a place that
YouTube creators can get products to
review and I saw this was one of the
products that was available for me to
review so I was like okay all I need to
do is make a video about this and
they'll send me one to try out so
because I wanted to try it and honestly
I didn't want to spend the money to try
it I was really excited to get it so now
I get to share that knowledge with you
and of course I had to do an ingredient
analysis on it so that you can know
whether the Seselj it or not so like I
mentioned this is available at Sephora I
did not do an extensive search to see
whether it was available other places
but I will link them in the description
below if it is available other places
and I'm going just going to read the
Sephora description it says it's a fast
absorbing body cream that helps to
tighten and smooth the look of skin and
it says that is formulated without
parabens or phthalates it is also
formulated without animal by-products
propylene glycol synthetic colours PGs
and petrolatum so if you're sensitive to
those if you don't like those you will
probably want to check this out they
also identify some key ingredients in
this that are the active ingredients the
first one is Guara now which I always
called garena or something but it's
Guarin apparently it supports natural
circulation boost energy and smoothes
the skin contains five times the
caffeine of coffee but you're putting it
on your bumbum so I don't know I'm not
going to drink it the next one is
something called Koopa wasu butter and
it says it's full of fatty acids and
phytosterols and polyphenols to lock in
moisture and help restore skin's
elasticity it also has si E which is the
antioxidant powerhouse
into one super fruit and it helps the
skin look and feel young and then
coconut oil melts easily into the skin
to soften condition and moisturize we're
going to go into the ingredient analysis
and then I'll tell you what I thought
about it after using it so here comes
the ingredient analysis I looked up all
of the ingredients and there wasn't a
single ingredient in here that was
identified as more than a 1 on
Environmental Working Group which is the
best it is officially the cleanest
product I have ever found in an
ingredient analysis where there wasn't
even anything that was a 2 it was all
one so that made me super super happy to
see that it's got incredible ingredients
in this product there are a couple of
ingredients that came up as acne causing
or irritating so if you have sensitive
skin in whatever area you're trying to
put this on or if you are prone to acne
in these areas you may want to watch out
the first one as I admit I did not look
up how to say it but it's cetera lack
alcohol I hope I said it right I might
have said that wrong it's a 2 for acne
and also a 2 for an irritant also cetyl
alcohol which is a 2 for acne and a 2
for irritant then we have the butter the
koopa wasu butter is labeled a 4 for
acne so even though it may be great for
your skin it may cause acne in some
people and then the last one is the
coconut oil believe it or not coconut
oil is a for for acne and a 1/4 an
irritant and I know a lot of people use
coconut oil on their face so definitely
you you know interpret these with a
grain of salt they're only going to be
some people that this is going to cause
a problem for and I believe that it's a
4 they do give out samples of this if
you want to try it so you can take it
home try it out see if it causes acne on
you but if you are not acne prone in
your area that you want to put it on you
probably will have no problem with it at
all as far as value you are getting this
one is 2.5 ounces and it's $25 so it's
$10 per ounce but if you get the bigger
one it is definitely a better value it's
an 8 point 1 ounce and it's $45 so
you're paying five dollars and 55 cents
per ounce so you get about twice the
value in the bigger size as you do the
smaller so if you end up liking it
definitely go for the bigger size now
from my personal opinion the first thing
I must say is it smells stinking amazing
everybody that sells it says it smells
amazing it smells amazing it's got like
a like a creamy it's almost like if you
got like a piña colada kind of
creaminess but it doesn't have that
strong rum kind of scent to it you know
what I mean like it's just very creamy
and like beachy but not Sun Tan Lotion
ii it's more like a mixed cocktail that
has a lot of cream in it and it just
smells really good
almost like a coconut frosting kind of
scent it just it's amazing
so now as far as the performance of it
um okay I have to admit I was dit for
about two weeks but I was inconsistent
and how much I was using it and you only
have so much time with octoly in order
to put up the review so I wish I had
another week to really test it but I
feel like I need to get this video up
for them I honestly didn't see any
results as far as the tightening of my
skin but I also feel like that might
have been my fault for not putting it on
as consistently as I should have you
know life happens get distracted so but
I did really like it as a moisturizer
I do definitely feel like I need to use
it more in order to see that tightening
but I saw absolutely no results for that
I would say though also that it does
give a little bit of a glow to the skin
so it's not like a sparkle it's just a
little bit of a glow so if you have
medium to deep skin tone or if you have
a tan then that definitely will make
your skin look look so super glowy with
me with my paler skin it doesn't really
do anything magical for me the glow but
I would imagine it would look amazing on
other people and it just feels really
good it hydrates beautifully and it
doesn't it doesn't seep into the skin
super fast but it doesn't bother me
because it doesn't feel greasy or oily
it just feels good on the skin and I'm
really looking forward to using this in
the winter time as my skin starts to dry
out might scan my hands especially from
washing them and things my elbows my
knees are really definitely going to be
using this a lot I am going to keep
trying it on my bum bum to see if I get
that tightening effect I'm also starting
to get a little chunky over here so I'm
probably
start putting it back here as well to
see if I can get some skin tightening
and some fat eating effects of it but so
far I can't speak to those effects but
what I would love it if you could do if
you've tried this and you have had
either positive or a negative experience
with it please leave your experience
down in the comments below so that I can
learn from you and the rest of the
community can learn from you in the
collective brain of makeup awesomeness
so we can all work together to decide
whether that claim actually works or not
but what I can speak to is the scent the
hydration are both amazing the
cleanliness of the ingredients amazing I
just can't really speak to the
effectiveness of the whole tightening of
the skin unfortunately but I want to
