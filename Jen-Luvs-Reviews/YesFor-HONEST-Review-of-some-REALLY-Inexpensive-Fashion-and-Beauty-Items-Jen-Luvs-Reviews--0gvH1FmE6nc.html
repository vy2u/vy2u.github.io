yes for now I yes for has been
contacting me for a really long time
asking me to do a review of their
service now I have said no for a very
long time because of the whole rose
wholesale fiasco and if you don't know
what the deal is with that i did a video
for a company called rose wholesale at
the time there were some mixed reviews
some people loved it some people didn't
like it they said the shipping was
really long i'm like dude it's from
china what do you expect you know lately
my rose wholesale video has skyrocketed
in views because they've been doing a
lot of advertisement on facebook now it
turns out rose wholesale seems to be a
big scam people are not getting what
they ordered people are not that quality
isn't there things are the outfits
aren't finished like they're not even
completely sewn people you know them
saying they're out of stock of things
and they won't return people's money
like it's bad I was really nervous to
say yes to yes for because it's another
chinese clothing a company so i did some
research i did some googling i I'd to
find out as much information as I could
reviews things like that and they seemed
to be really positive all the videos on
YouTube seemed to be really positive so
I was like okay maybe this will be like
a replacement for rose wholesale for
people that you know wanted to order
former wholesale but realized that it
was bad they also have some beauty items
as well so I got a few of those for you
they actually offered me about forty
dollars worth of stuff is what they gave
me so everything i'm showing you today i
got for forty dollars and that does not
include the shipping that was just off
their website I don't know anything
about the shipping because I did not pay
for shipping this was sent to me for
promotion and I promise you that will
not influence my review nor has it ever
when something is sent to me so and you
all be able to see the quality for
yourself so you'll be able to see
whether you think that it's good or not
all I can speak to is how fast it came
to me which was about two weeks a week
and a half for them to get it to me and
I can speak to the quality of the things
that I personally see so we'll start
with like the beauty stuff first with
is all I got all nail stuff all the nail
stuff came in the separate bag away from
the clothing items so I got two sets of
nail polish brushes and I'll show you
what they look like up close okay I know
there's a little bit of a glare on the
bag but you can see the brushes they
definitely feel very soft they seem to
be the bristles seem to be in the ferals
really really well the ferrule seem to
be of high quality this is I can't tell
if that's and then gets a plastic it
seems to be a plastic here but they seem
to be a very good quality and I've used
them not a whole lot but so far so good
on these I also got these here because
my nail polish brush does seem to fall
apart pretty easily and this one has
more so these are mine these are the
ones i'm giving away and i think i'm
pretty sure they're exactly the same and
they're dotting tools they're all
different sizes some of them are
actually pretty similar in size but
there's definitely bigger ones and
smaller ones so i think that these came
with some of the nail polish brushes and
that's why i got them these are about
two dollars something like that on
Amazon including shipping like they're
really ridiculously cheap to buy but I
thought it would be fun to give these
away because they are so awesome these
are the ones that missjenfabulous
recommended that's my favorite nail
polish channel that in cutepolish but
anyway so i'm going to be giving these
away so if you're interested in winning
the dotting tools are just going to put
a comment down below that you'd like to
win the dotting tools and then within 20
about 24 ish hours after this video goes
live probably closer to 30 hours I will
be picking a winner through random.org
so if you're interested in these and
want to give these a good home go ahead
and do that now back to the review
definitely these look like they're the
exact same ones that i always use so
these are definitely a win and so far so
good on these this pack seems to be a
little bit cheaper made than these maybe
but um these seem to be fine too I mean
there's nothing there's no bristles
falling out they do feel a little bit
crispy which kind of makes me it almost
feels like they might have been used at
one point but I just run my finger
through it and it seems to be fine but
they seem to be fine you know for what
they are I mean there now they're
cheaper nail polish brushes so i am
happy to have them and they will be used
until I wear them Alex so the next thing
I got I'm actually gonna
my first use of them and my first
impressions of them and their these nail
polish remover pens and I'm going to
just I'm just going to go ahead and show
you the clip of me using these for the
first time right now alright so we're
going to go ahead and try out this nail
polish removal pen pad just polish on
for a really long time so it's all
chippy and yucky so we're going to go
ahead and see how this works now I will
show you that in the back they do have
some replacement tips here which i think
is pretty cool so we'll see how much
damage one time does to this so let's
say is there anything coming out of here
no let me shake it up a bit let's say I
don't have any products coming out there
were no directions included okay so i
tried want it this pink one this pink
one seems to be working so i removed a
tiny bit of polish and it's just you
know it feels just a little bit wet and
let's see how long it takes to remove
you can see that it's coming off there
it's definitely not coming off easily
i'll tell you that yeah this is not a
functional way to remove nail polish at
all this is this is not worth my time
here just for scientific purposes we'll
keep going till let's go on but this is
just taking way too long and this side
doesn't feel good to remove it gets to
round on that sign I wish that they had
made it flat on both sides oh my
goodness there is no way I'm language
you're trying to make it through this
one nail this isn't any hardcore nail
polish running this is just julep which
usually is pretty easy to remove I mean
it's multiple coats so maybe we should
take that into account that it was
multiple coats I had two coats of the
base and then the stripes that design by
the way is I'd missjenfabulous design
I'll link that video down below in case
you're curious how I did that nail
polish all right is it off is it off
enough you had no there's still some
polish alright that's enough
close enough BAM finally poo and you can
see how the tip looks after that one use
so I don't know how efficient it would
be taking off more polish I'm not going
to waste my time doing another nail okay
so as you can see they were a huge bust
the one is completely dried out the
other four are not dried out but you
could see the amount of time it took for
them to work was just not even worth it
so these will actually probably go into
the trash if the person who wins the
dotting tools wants these that I'd be
happy to send them to that person so
that's it for the nail stove now let's
get into the clothing items so here in
the US it is getting closer to cold
weather season it's full so I got a
couple of fall items fall winter and
this was the first thing I got and it's
this cutie little hat and I'll show you
what that looks like on me I know it
doesn't match my outfit at all because
I'm wearing like a a summertime shirt
almost but its kind of falling you know
but yeah so that's how the little hat
looks it's a little baggie in the back
which is like super uber trendy and I
really really like it it seems to be a
really good quality on I honestly like
looking at it I mean it's it's a knit
hat that don't see any pools in it it's
evenly stitched there's no problems with
them and this is like a faux leather ish
kind of braids here the leather here is
actually glued on let me show you so you
see how it's like this hardcore glue
it's not even so don so that is not good
i don't like that at all not cool at all
so that's the only thing but i think as
long as that glue holds we're gonna be
good to go I better not try to wash it
cuz if I try to wash and it's gonna be
done so this is the jacket and I'm gonna
put it on show you hopefully you'll be
able to see all right so the material of
this i'ma show you its got like got kind
of vodka I got half hood here which is
kind of cute and then it's got like this
fuzzy stuff right here the fuzzy stuff
does not go all the way down it only
goes to here um like uh almost look like
dog fur to me but I mean not in a bad
way but it's very open and airy
I love hoods like that and then it's got
two zippers it's got one zipper here and
one zipper here is you take this one and
this one goes here okay so that zips to
there and then this one zips on the
outside and this was a bit tricky to
pull it stretches but it was a bit it's
a bit tricky to pull like this having
trouble getting the zipper up there we
go ok so this zipper goes to here so
that's the way it looks zipped up I do
like this the material is very soft but
it I don't know for some reason it feels
very synthetic and a little bit cheap
from here to here is where the cuff goes
so it's quite long you can probably roll
this up and make it be a little bit
shorter if you like it that style I'm
think I'm going to do that because those
cuffs are really long I don't know if
you're supposed to do that or not oh you
can bring it all the way down there and
it feels very snug here kind of where it
is a longer a longer jacket with like
some leggings or whatever if that you
know is your fashion so I'm going to
take this off because it's already
making me sweat but I mean I like this
this jacket I don't know if I would
recommend this jacket unless you
particularly like the style just because
I don't know the material just doesn't
feel a high quality it doesn't feel bad
it just doesn't feel up high quality if
that makes sense so I don't know I mean
it was cheap and it feels a little cheap
so you know with this you kind of get
what you pay for it's not bad it's not
great all right next let's show you the
jewelry oh my goodness this is the bow
bracelet and I don't know any of the
names of any of the stuff so I'm just
going to insert them but this I really
really like let me zoom it in I just
think that that is so cute it's got the
front where opens here I'll show you how
big it is on my wrist and I do have
pretty small wrists but I love the way
that hangs and the back closure seems to
be of high quality not high quality but
good enough quality it's not going to
break in a second all the gems are in
and it feels very sturdy so I
for a piece of costume jewelry I really
like this a lot and I have not worn
these pieces of jewelry over a long
period of time so it's possible that
they won't last if there's any problems
breaking down the jewelry i will put
annotations i will put it in the
description so if you don't see any of
that that means it held up next I got
this cute little ring and once I fixed
it it looks a lot better but i'll show
you what that looks like it's like a
little flower ring like a lotus i think
so when I got it the petals were kind of
mushed up and I don't want to bend them
more because I'm scared I'm gonna break
it but these were pushed forward a
little too much so I had to kind of
fluff it out and I was terrified that I
was going to break it thankfully I
didn't and I really like the way that it
looks and it's got an adjustable back
here actually this one here you can tell
us a little bit bent so I can kind of
push that down and make it so it's a
little less spin so you can see how
those kind of move a little bit even
though I don't think they're supposed to
show the with the ring though I mean
it's only it's less than two dollars for
the ring so is it worth two dollars yeah
it's worth two dollars i think it's
worth maybe three or four dollars like i
don't know i would pay three two three
four dollars for it so definitely good
on that and i really think that this
bracelet is definitely worth the price
as well so the last thing that i got as
far as jewelry was this little pair of
earrings and overall i think that
they're cute let me show you up close
they're just these little flowers and
the two piece is very trendy right now
even though a lot of times they're
hanging behind the ear at this point but
i really really like these they're cute
they're very simple but for three
dollars i definitely think there were
three dollars my biggest complaint about
these are the backs the backs are
ginormous overall but they don't fit
like that it doesn't fit on here i can
push as hard as you know oh and it's not
going on the backs do not fit the
earring but i have plenty of back so
it'll be okay but still i mean you think
that the back would go on the air let's
talk about whether this is worth it okay
are the items actually worth what you
pay for so the first thing is the nail
stuff now I definitely think that this
is worth ten dollars I
a little kit from Sally that was like
maybe six or seven dollars for for nail
polish brushes and I feel like these are
just as good a quality if not better
than those and you get so many stinkin
brushes you get 22 brushes then you get
the nail polish pens but those kind of I
mean those are stupid and you're not
there they're worth zero dollars but so
let's just throw those out of the
equation so you've got 22 brushes and
then you get the dotting tools for 10
bucks I think that's definitely worth it
so that is a big thumbs up hat is six
dollars I definitely think this was
worth six dollars i would say that this
one is to me is worth ten dollars maybe
12 just because i would say even more if
it weren't for the glue here the jacket
here all the retail price on this is
seventeen dollars i think that's a
little bit much just because of the way
that it feels I don't know it just feels
like a cheap dollar store blanket as far
as like the felts feeling or something
you would get from five below as far as
the feeling of this even though it's
soft it just feels very thin and cheap
it'll work fine though I would say this
I will put this at a value of maybe $14
something like that just because of the
quality of the fabric and how it feels
alright the bracelet I would put the
value of the this bracelet at ten
dollars this was about two dollars I
definitely think this is worth way over
two dollars this one's a huge win the
lotus flower ring because of the
adjustable band and the fact that these
bend I would put this at a value of
maybe three dollars but it's only a
retail value of under two dollars so I
definitely think this is worth it and
then with the earrings these are retail
value of three dollars and I think that
that's fair just because the backs don't
fit if the backs fit i would put these
at six dollars so overall i am very
happy with yes for from what i have
gotten from my personal experience
having not paid for shipping which seems
to be reasonable based on their website
from previewing it i haven't gone
through the whole process but I'd added
things my cart and seeing the shipping
it seems to be reasonable you know as
far as the customer service and what
whether you get what you order and all
that I can't speak to that but base
on my personal experience with them I
think yes for is a thumbs up which I am
surprised is to be completely honest
after the big fiasco with Rose
wholesales so if anything changes if I
hear any feedback any negative feedback
I will make sure that it is annotated
I'll make sure it's in the description
