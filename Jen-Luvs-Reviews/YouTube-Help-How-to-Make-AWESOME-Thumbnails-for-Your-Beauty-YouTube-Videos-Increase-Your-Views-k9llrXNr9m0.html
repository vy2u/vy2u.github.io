mine on you to ask me about how to
improve her videos and what I told her a
big thing is was that her her thumbnails
for her videos were kind of out of focus
she was maybe had her mouth open because
she's in the middle of a talking or
something was happening where it wasn't
a good advertisement for what the video
was going to be and what I learned from
her is that she does not have the
ability to change her thumbnails so I
wanted to show you how to get the
ability to change your thumbnails and
then exactly how to change your
thumbnails to make them so much better
not to say that I have the perfect
thumbnails the best thumbnails ever but
just I just wanted to show you how I do
it and maybe you can even improve on
what I'm doing by adding your own
strategies so you know everyone's got
their own personal preferences but i
want to show you how to do that today so
I've logged into another account that I
have that's like old and we have many
videos on it and as this LYLAS mommy 37
don't bother it or subscribe to exile
put anything on it I'm mostly just set
it up for my kid so what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to go to the little blue
square to get to my account and I'm
going to go to video manager okay and
when as you can see let me go ahead to
this video and we're going to edit and
we'll go to info and settings so you can
see so you see there's just these three
choices and if I don't like any of those
choices then tough luck you're stuck
with it whether your mouths open your
eyes closed whatever so that's why it's
really good to enable uh you know your
videos to have this feature so what I'm
going to do in order to fix this channel
as I am going to go to channel settings
and i am going to enable monetization
and i'm going to enable my account and
I've read of course I've read them we
all agreed all that stuff right I agree
that i will not click on google as this
is so so important people get their
videos suspended for clicking on the ads
and their videos don't ever do that
and then I will not opt-in any content
for monetization which I do not possess
sufficient rights so you know think
music that you don't own video clips
that you don't own your agreeing to that
so when I hit accept and I'm just going
to let all this stuff my videos don't
contain product placements us on this
inactive channel so i'm going to
monetize and i understand i'm good ok so
now this little ? has appeared next to
my video that shows that they're kind of
going to be looking at that video to see
if it's ok to monetize so now i'm going
to go back to my info and settings and
hopefully there we go see there it is
now it says custom thumbnail and the
perk of this also is that once you set
for monetization you now have the
ability to earn money off of your videos
you're not automatically going to start
earning money until you either sign up
with a network or go through google
adsense instead of an account there but
you know all of your videos are going in
that direction now so even if you're not
set up for monetization as far as like
you're not actually hooked up to get
paid your videos are eligible for that
now so you basically just made yourself
a YouTube partner in the end of it other
than the fact that you don't have the
actual finance is set up yet ok so now
that I have enabled my channel for
monetization now I can do my custom
thumbnail just go back into it i went
and i was in my editing software but you
can just have your video rolling in
whatever you want i'm just going to
reopen it it's my beauty box 5 from
march was the video that i have so when
I film my video I always shoot like a
little like beginning piece you guys get
to see this this is kind of ridiculous
but I always shoot something like this
of me just posing and like see I'm like
looking at the camera do I look cute I'm
looking over here I'm going I don't even
know if this is a good box I don't even
know what that face is but I just kind
of pause it so I kind of arrow back and
forth until I find a good shot like that
one's not bad and then what I do because
I'm on a pc I'm going to go to
I snipping tool I don't know you know
you might have to search for it on your
computer for where let me see are you
can be able to see that it's down here
it's like little scissors okay and it's
a snipping tool it's in your accessories
if you have a PC I've captured that one
a few minutes ago I just capture a few
of them and the way to do that I just
hit a new snip and then I just whoa I
don't know what happened there let's try
that again if it comes out funky like
that just start over okay and then I
just capture that picture and then I
just save it bb5 whatever I want to do
maybe five tests okay so now i have my
picture that i want to add it now i'm
going to show you something magical that
totally changed my life and i cannot
even remember the person that showed me
this but she has a ridiculous amount of
subscribers and i was like oh my gosh
girlfriend thank you so much for showing
this to me and she responded back it was
like no problem and she's got like
hundreds of thousand subscribers I know
who it is i'll put it in the description
down below but it's called PicMonkey now
I bought a subscription to PicMonkey I
for damage it was like 30 bucks or some
thirty-five dollars a year something
like yes so I could get all the features
but there's a lot of a lot of things
that are free on this website so you can
try it out see what you think and and
then you know decide whether you want to
buy the yearly subscription like I did
so I'm just going to click touch up and
then i'm going to pick one of my
pictures so and i'm actually going to
edit the thumbnail they're going to use
and i look at these small here you can
see I've got all these selfies here it's
kind of embarrassing um but yes I've got
all these selfies and I think small this
one's my favorite so I'm just going to
go ahead and select that one and there
you go it opens up first thing I do is I
take away my wrinkles and i erase those
as I don't like those raised my forehead
wrinkles I'm going to make my brush size
a little smaller I'm gonna erase my
under eye circles there we go raise
those little wrinkly guys there that's
kind of the extent of my touching up
that I normally do sometimes oh that's
kind of weird looking over here I'll get
rid of that you know i mean the tools
here our show
cool then you always want to hit apply
and there's all kinds of stuff here you
can airbrush it to make it look like you
know you're a little more airbrushed you
can whiten your teeth you can change
your lip color you can take away your
blemishes I mean there's all kinds of
cool stuff you can do and they're all
preset so you don't have to worry about
that I even actually sometimes add extra
hair up if I feel like my hair looks
really thin so if I want to add some
more hair I can like click there and
then add a little more hair there make
my hair look a little thicker you know
Sam you also can add these uh these
borders here that come out really cool
you can change the color of the border
like I can click here and I can change
the color the border to the beauty box
five color and let's say I can be done
there are you can you can do this and
you can apply you know try all these
other things there's little stamps you
know all these different really cool
stamps to do different themes you know
add hearts whatever now I'm just going
to hit save save to my computer and I
always just add the word edit after it
so I know and actually I'm going to
upload i haven't uploaded this video
yeah i'm gonna go ahead and upload it i
always go to scheduled and then make it
go at whatever time i want so i'm gonna
upload my video and then now here comes
my custom thumbnail and i can click my
thumbnail and don't edit out uh where is
it where is it there you are there's my
custom thumbnail now you can see the
edges kind of got cut off that was
because of the sizing of the picture i
can go back and crop it and play with it
to make sure that i have that full frame
on there but that's the basics of it
that i wanted to show you how to like
hook up your thumbnail and so that
people are more likely to click on it
you know your thumbnail is your
advertisement for your video and if you
don't have the thumbnail looking like
something people want to watch people
won't watch it if you walk in front of a
store and you look at the storefront and
you know it's a restaurant in all the
windows look greasy and you know it
looks dirty inside people aren't going
to want to go in that restaurant if you
go to a store you know and and the
people
in there you go look on deshevle you
know you're not you're not going to want
to go in a clothes store where the
clothes are lying everywhere and it
doesn't look like you know a place that
you want to visit your thumbnail is your
storefront it's what's telling people
you know you want to come visit this
video this video is worthwhile for
watching and it's really like as you can
see is not that hard to do to get these
custom thumbnails so hopefully that
video was helpful for you if it was make
sure you give this video a thumbs up and
subscribe if you'd like to see more
videos like this and mad love to you my
friends and I will see you in a video
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
