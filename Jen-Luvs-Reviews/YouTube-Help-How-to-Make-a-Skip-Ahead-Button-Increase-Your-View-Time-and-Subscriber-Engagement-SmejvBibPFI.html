requested video and I get asked all the
time how to make a skip ahead button
it's a something that I've never seen on
other videos and I decided to add it
because I found myself watching YouTube
videos and wishing that I could just
skip to the next thing and I asked
myself is there a way that I can do that
on my videos for the convenience of
others so this is what I came up with so
the way that I get to it is I just go to
my video so I'm just going to go to the
video that I just uploaded that is not
live quite yet but will be and it's my
new epsy video and I'm going to click
here and I'm going to go to annotations
and my video is going to automatically
start playing and I start talking bla
bla bla bla
okay now this here is my skip ahead text
that I added in my editing software now
you don't have to have text from your
editing software if you don't want to
I'm going to show you first how to do
the button without the text from editing
software so while you're going to do is
you're going to go to add annotation and
you're going to click on note hey you're
going to type in skip ahead if I can
tell you and then you're just going to
move it to wherever you want to have it
let's say we want to have it in this
corner okay so there's my skip ahead
button it tells me what time the skip
ahead button is going to start okay now
I'm going to click on link I'm going to
go up to the title of my video and I'm
going to right click now I'm going to go
to copy link address I just need the the
address of my video of the video that
I'm currently wanting to skip ahead
button on I need that address so that's
how I just got that
now I'm going to go down here I'm going
to right click and I'm going to paste
okay so now that is
to bring me to the very beginning of
that video but I don't want it to bring
me to the beginning I want it to bring
me to the next section of my video so
I'm going to play my video and I'm going
to skip ahead blah blah blah shush it
Jen too much gabbing okay there's the
first product so that's where I want to
make it go to at 49 seconds is when I
start talking about the product so I'm
going to change this end time to 49
seconds and I'm going to start the
linked video at 49 seconds these two
should always be the same okay now I'm
going to create a new button note you
got to do this every time skip ahead
drag it down now this one is going to
start at 49 seconds it says 49 because
that's when I hit the button up here
that's when I hit this I paused it at
49.8 but I want at 49 point I want it
where the other one left off so I'm
going to change that to 49 point oh I
just keep it easy and I always keep this
at point-o it just makes my life easier
it's not the exact point it doesn't
matter that much now I'm going to link
and I should still have that address
saved in my clipboard so now all I need
to do is right-click and paste or you
can do ctrl V whatever makes you happy
and then I watch until I stop talking
about the lipstick and start talking
about the next product so I skip ahead
la blah blah blah blah blah there's more
lipstick blah blah blah okay there's I'm
starting to talk about the back so I'm
going to rewind swatch swatch okay so
there's the bag so I'm going to start
I'm going to end my clip at one minute
and 47 seconds and I want to start my
linked video at one minute and 47
seconds now when something that's really
important that will make your life
easier is you want to do 0 1 4 7 don't
ask me why if you don't do it you'll
figure out why but just trust me you
want to do 0 1 you don't just want to
type 1
it just makes it more complicated so you
don't want to do that okay and then you
just keep doing that for every single
product you add a new annotation note
skip ahead blah blah blah all the same
things that I just did if you decide you
make a mistake you can just hit the
trashcan and it will delete now if you
do end up adding text it's the same
thing this is what I typically do
instead of doing in the adding the text
I add a spotlight I drag it over my text
I make it the size that I want and then
I do the exact same thing and I
right-click and I paste same situation I
just make it a spotlight instead of a
note that's it I feel like this one is a
really really good one because it does
increase your view time it makes it so
people will watch your video longer if
they feel like that they can skip the
things they're not interested in I've
noticed my view time going up when I do
this and that makes you look cooler on
YouTube and in the algorithm the longer
your watch time the better you look so
very important to increase your watch
time in any way possible and this is
something I have found to be successful
not only for my subscribers who enjoy
skipping ahead when I'm talking about
something they're not interested in but
also to increase my view time so that my
videos are seen as being better I hope
you found this video helpful if you did
make sure you give it a thumbs up and
make sure you subscribe if you would
like to see more helpful hint videos
like this one or makeup reviews or
subscription box openings and all the
other wonderful things that I do so mad
love to my friends and I will see you in
a video soon
there you go bye my friends see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
