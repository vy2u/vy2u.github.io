subscription well not new subscription
but I had a subscription that is new to
me that I want to share with you and I'm
very excited about it and it's called
use in box and the delightful people use
in box contact me and asked me to review
their mothers day subscription now they
did send me two boxes so I'm not quite
sure whether you would get one box or
two boxes for your subscription i will
put information down in the description
about that as far as what exactly you
get for the 33 dollar a month one month
it's like a quarterly thing subscription
price use inbox was inspired by the
company that people who started the
company they spent some time in japan
and they just love their time there and
they they felt like they really wanted
to capture the the spas and all the
pampering that happens in the spas in
japan using translate in translates into
the word pattern which is the this is
what they tell me is it describes the
process of making ornate kimonos and
exquisite Japanese origami paper so
inside supposedly there is a piece of
authentic using paper which i think is
really cool because anything from
countries that i will probably never go
to in life you're saying is amazing to
get they say the each box box is valued
at between fifty and a hundred dollars
so $33 is a good deal because you're
getting a lot more i'm just reading off
of my notes here um you can purchase a
single box as a gift subscription or
they also have a men's box as well this
that's that's basically the deal with
using box i guess these are in no
particular order i'm just going to start
with the blue one because blue makes me
happy it's such a bright beautiful color
so it says greetings from use in they
have a facebook twitter and pinterest if
you want to hear more and then i'll put
the link to use a box calm down below
Jen and Ted or the lovely people that
create this and then it's got some of
the products inside and on the back and
here is the beautiful using paper
gorgeous absolutely gorgeous how
beautiful it's got a little bit of a
sure to it and they say you can use it
as a bookmark or you know whatever so
that's really cute let's see what else
is in here okay so this is how oh my
gosh I can smell it smells so good
smells not lavender almost like a mint
kind of scent already so that's what
that looks like inside so the first
thing I see is a chalk love cherries and
almonds in dark chocolate bar and this
is a smaller version this isn't a
full-size I see these at Whole Foods all
the time I've had this before and it is
really really yummy then this is it says
Lotus we are way w/e i I'm not sure how
to pronounce that flower alchemy after
13 years of independent research a
flower and plant based healing katie has
visionary and Alchemist all right a
growing and innovative company that
takes organic to the next level enhance
your state of mind this is so day oh my
gosh it's got this whole like little
thing and it says pick a flower choose
the flower that visually appeals to
imagine to the number inside to find out
what you need most need okay so let's do
this together this is fun oh I dropped
my use in box okay so those are all the
flower choices and i'm going to pick I
typically would pick number one but i'm
going to pick number five okay so here's
the key to tell you what you need most
so according to this i inspired action I
need inspired action and if you know
these subscription boxes i absolutely
love supporting small businesses and
people that just have a passion for
something it just makes me excited so
let me see what this actually is I got
infinite love and it's a missed it does
it's got a sweetness to it almost like a
honeysuckle smell but um there's
something else in there that's more
sugary like a honeysuckle with sugar
mandarin rose and honey I was almost
there almost there love it oh that
smells so good there we go very nice oh
oh you know what's so funny I've gotten
this before and this is what happens
when you get way too many subscription
boxes you should get repeat products but
this is a body balm called ball me up
and this is organic sweet cocoa and
any body balm and I've gotten this
before and i did not enjoy the smell let
me see if i can open it without
compromising the product oh no this one
smells better than the last one that I
got this one smells good I am going to
keep this because I think it's a
different scent the last 1i got smelled
a little funky but it was it's quite
oily it's almost like a Vaseline kind of
texture but I don't think that it's it's
palm kernel oil based and it's just a
moisturizer ok this is a compassion
lemongrass lemon and spearmint candle I
bet you this is what I've been smelling
for three weeks uh-huh it smells really
really good it's by Shran rom mindful
living and that's all that it says on
there mmm that smells good very nice and
it's a glass jar there so the candle has
no artificial colors synthetic
fragrances no animal derived ingredients
and as a hundred percent vegetable wax
coat and there is a twenty five twenty
percent off coupon code other twenty
percent coupon codes for like everything
a lot of things I'll put all those
coupon codes down below for you okay
this one is also Shran rum and this is a
calm down hand cream the stuff really
does smell good I mean they're talking
about pampering in a box i think they
nailed it with this it definitely has
that lemony citrusy kind of smell i
really like this box so far and then
this is he I don't take baths so
anything having to do with bass they
don't really use I'll pass them along to
my friend who does take baths this is by
somebody and it's a some fizzer from
coconut and cream maybe i'll give it to
my daughter because she likes to take
baths mmm it smells good very nice and
then this is an a cure lemon probiotic
radical resurfacing even skin tone
nature's blend of brightening lemon
probiotic and our proprietary organic
matter they that were shy child I look
like an idiot when I try to pronounce
these things and it ends up being
obvious but it basically it smooths your
skin's texture shy or ella ella and it
looks like this and it's filled to about
here and again if they all have similar
smells that citrusy kind of smell but
this one smells more like a lotion so
how do you do this you apply it under
your moisturizer and then the last
things I see are these little bath melts
and again I don't take baths but I will
pass the one and these are also by
somebody and again that citrusy kind of
smell so if you don't like a citrusy
smell you probably would not be happy
with this but I personally love it I
think it smells amazing so I am happy
with all of these things here with this
box i'm most excited i think about this
spray i'm also excited about the candle
and the lotion here those are the ones
that really make me personally happy
that is a personal preference thing
there's also a bunch of cards in here
twenty percent off at somebody SEO turn
your shower into a spa unforgettable
aroma's in the shower cool twenty
percent off and then at body balm nice
twenty percent off and then saran rom no
parabens no bad stuff there's a whole
list of things that this stuff doesn't
have that's really cool Oh some
cruelty-free all that good stuff so they
also set me this one and I don't know
whether this is another version of the
mothers day one or if this is just part
of it where you get two boxes there's a
note for me maybe it'll explain okay
let's see it says hello so the the blue
was the subscription the $33
subscription and then the white is a
current gift so this is a gift box and
that was the subscription box okay so
you guess you get the choice of doing
the subscription or the gift box oh
thank you ted and jen i was really nice
a sweet little note cool and then it's
got the products in here just like the
other one and here's the beautiful paper
in this one oh my gosh that is just
gorgeous oh I love it just the little
touches means so much you know okay so
this is how this one looks inside
beautiful instead of worms we get
peanuts hey first thing I see who these
are going to be shared with my husband
I'm sure
our dark chocolate Sun cups these are
called mint cuffs yums I know he's so
excited he's over there listening to me
film and it's dark chocolate and mint
and I'm not flip free and gluten free
and it doesn't look like there's a whole
lot of ingredients in here which is very
nice and the next thing I see is a
Curtis in Florian uh some kind of bomb I
don't know what the deal is with this Oh
massage daily into feet baby you want to
give me a foot massage later yeah I
think I think this is gonna be a good
thing let's see what this stuff smells
like I'm excited about this he doesn't
seem very excited about rubbing my feet
who got someone I let it suddenly got
that oh cuz i squirted it all out
medicinal kind of smell to it but it's
not a bad smell and there's two nail
polishes in here oh haha they look I was
just about to say they look like
spiritual there are little mini spa
rituals and I love me some spy ritual I
usually have gotten sparitual nail
polishes in my boxy charm i do not own
either one of these colors these are
really neat this one is a bright red and
it is called hunka burning love and this
one is called golden golden rule usually
spy rituals are a one to two coat polish
this one looks about the same probably a
to cook polish on this one and this is a
glitter i'm not going to drip test that
one but excited to have those and then
this here is a stress relief role on
remedy i need some of that give me some
of that stress relief oh it smells very
clean i think john my husband's gonna
like this one cuz it smells clean roll
it on I could fall asleep right now
smells nice it smells almost like baby
powder ish though like a sweet baby
powder it smells good though I'm very
excited about this I don't think I've
been a single thing and either one of
these boxes Rob what all know my ball
okay this is a moisture miss by seni
does okay wait home it maximizes the
delivery of active ingredients what does
that mean hydrates and heal skin while
also enhancing the spread ability and
penetrate
your moisturizer so I guess you spray it
on before your moisturizer so that the
good ingredients in the moisturizer can
really seep into your skin that's kind
of neat i've never heard of that before
I know para dens preservatives no
artificial ingredients and it's kosher
for all you people that keep kosher see
how this mist is whoo there's no smell
to it no smell which is nice if your
spring something all over your face you
don't want it to have a strong smell so
that's nice and then this is your leak I
think I've heard of this I think that
this is an expensive brand if I remember
correctly it sounds very fancy shmancy
and this is a rose hand cream and it's a
rich hydrating hand cream my husband
loves Rose rose sets i know i keep
talking about anybody's sitting right
over there it's hard not to talk about
him yeah it smells like roses smells
nice it's not super strong I mean let me
spread some of the songs see how it
moisturizes really rosy and it does have
a little bit of an old lady kind of
smell seeps in really nicely though the
formula is nice my hands feel really
soft liking the formula not a big fan of
the scent but that's okay it will get
used and loved and then there's a couple
more things in here this is a crush mask
anti-aging a facial mask and I do not
use facial mess i always pass them on to
my friend Mary Lynn hi Marilyn you get
another mass girlfriend ok so this is a
anti-aging mask and some of my friends
here on YouTube that comment under my
videos encouraged me and encouraged me
to try facial mask again but they freak
me out they're cold and they're wet and
they're uncomfortable and I don't know
how people can be relaxed with something
like this on their face because it's
just so it feels really creepy to me so
I pass them along and then the last
thing in here is a level naturals lemon
verbena candle and it's a soy candle and
we just did science projects in my
fourth grade class and one of the
science projects was which kind of
candle burns the fastest and they
learned that soy candles burn the
fastest so I told them I said thanks to
them I will not buy any more soy candles
but this is a soy candle so I will get
to test it on my own to see if it is
true that this will burn through very
quickly smells really good lemon and
sweetness
and yumminess and it's an all natural
candle and then I got a card in here
about Senate us the moisture mist twenty
percent off I'll put all that twenty
percent off goodness down below in case
you're interested in checking out any of
these companies or products I will put
them down there but you know I mean as
far as the total value of this I think
if you are a makeup lover this is and
you don't care about skin care you don't
care about bad product you don't care
about candles this will not be a
subscription for you but if you love
skincare products spa products you know
things like that like pampering yourself
kind of making a spa in your own home if
that sounds appealing to you this may be
something you want to check out because
there's a lot of products in here and
these are all products from smaller
companies companies you won't run into
it'sa for companies you won't run into
at the drugstore you know it's just very
unique that you're not going to find
anywhere else so I love that about the
subscription that it gives you a unique
opportunity to try products from smaller
companies and yeah I'm really excited
about it so thank you so much to Ted and
Jen for sending me these use and boxes I
am really happy with them and I cannot
wait to try all these products and any
of them that are fantastic or amazing
will show up in my spring favorites
which will be coming up in a few weeks I
just I can't do favorites every month
it's just too much so I'm just going to
do them per season so fantastic products
from here will show up there or in
empties videos which I'm starting to
develop at this point let me see
anything else I want to tell you oh I'm
going to be just some a little
announcements I'm going to be on a blog
talk radio show on May twenty-fifth at
seven-thirty p.m. and it is the derrick
and k show it's almost like a morning
radio sounding show they're very funny
very fun and I cannot wait to be on
their show they are going to be allowing
call in so if you're interested in
chatting it up on blogtalkradio that's
the time to do it or you can always
listen to it after it's been recorded if
you just want to hear how it went I have
a feeling they're going to ask me a lot
about my video the truth about making
money on youtube and being a beauty guru
so I'm a little nervous
about what they're going to ask me about
that hopefully I don't get my youtube
since they're dead you know we'll see

phone another thing I wanted to tell you
