subscription well not new subscription
but I had a subscription that is new to
me that I want to share with you and I'm
very excited about it and it's called
use inbox and the delightful people use
inbox contact me and asked me to review
their mother's day subscription now they
did send me two boxes so I'm not quite
sure whether you would get one box or
two boxes for your subscription I will
put information down in the description
about that as far as what exactly you
get for the $33 a month one that month
it's like a quarterly thing subscription
price use inbox was inspired by the
company that people who started the
company they spent some time in Japan
and they just loved their time there and
they they felt like they really wanted
to capture the the spas and all the
pampering that happens in the spas in
Japan using translate in translates into
the word pattern which is the this is
what they tell me is it describes the
process of making ornate kimonos and
exquisite Japanese origami paper
so inside supposedly there is a piece of
authentic using paper which i think is
really cool because anything from
countries that I will probably never go
to in life I just think is amazing to
get they say the each box box is valued
at between 50 and $100 so 33 dollars is
a good deal because you're getting a lot
more I'm just reading off of my notes
here um you can purchase a single box as
a gift subscription or they also have a
men's box as well this that's that's
basically the deal with using box I
guess these are in no particular order
I'm just gonna start with the blue one
because blue makes me happy it's such a
bright beautiful color so it says
greetings from used in they have a
Facebook Twitter and Pinterest if you
want to hear more and then I'll put the
link to use a box calm down below Jenn
and Ted or the lovely people that create
this and then it's got some of the
products inside and on the back and here
is the beautiful using paper gorgeous
absolutely gorgeous how beautiful it's
got a little bit of a tag
sure to it and they say you can use it
as a bookmark or you know whatever so
that's really cute let's see what else
is okay so this is how oh my gosh I can
smell it smells so good
smells not lavender almost like a mint
kind of scent already so that's what
that looks like inside so the first
thing I see is a chalk love cherries and
almonds in dark chocolate bar and this
is a smaller version this isn't a
full-size I see these at Whole Foods all
the time I've had this before and it is
really really yummy then this is it says
Lotus we are way w/e I I'm not sure how
to pronounce that this flower alchemy
after 13 years of independent research
of flower and plant-based healing KT has
some visionary and alchemist all right a
growing an innovative company that takes
organic to the next level enhance your
state of mind this is sad it's got this
whole like little thing and it says pick
a flower choose the flower that visually
appeals to imagine to the number inside
to find out what you need most need okay
so let's do this together this is fun oh
I dropped my using box okay so those are
all the flower choices and I'm going to
pick I typically would pick number one
but I'm gonna pick number five okay so
here's the key to tell you what you need
most so according to this I inspired
action
I need inspired action and if you know
these subscription boxes I absolutely
love supporting small businesses and
people that just have a passion for
something it just makes me excited so
let me see what this actually is
I got infinite love and it's a mist it
does it's got a sweetness to it almost
like a honeysuckle smell but there's
something else in there that's more
sugary like a honeysuckle with sugar
mandarin rose and honey I was almost
there oh it's there love it oh that
smells so good there we go very nice oh
oh you know what's so funny I've gotten
this before and this is what happens
when you get way too many subscription
boxes you get repeat products but this
is a body bomb called bomb me up and
this is organic sweet cocoa and
body balm and I've gotten this before
and I did not enjoy the smell let me see
if I can open it without compromising
the product oh no this one smells better
than the last one that I got this one
smells good I am gonna keep this because
I think it's a different scent the last
one I got smelled a little funky but it
was it's quite oily it's almost like a
Vaseline kind of texture but I don't
think that it's it's palm kernel oil
based and it's just a moisturizer okay
this is a compassion lemongrass lemon
and spearmint candle I bet you this is
what I've been smelling for three weeks
uh-huh it smells really really good
it's by Shran rum mindful living and
that's all that it says on there mmm
that's the most good very nice and it's
a glass jar there so the candle has no
artificial colors synthetic fragrances
no animal derived ingredients and is a
hundred percent vegetable wax goal and
there is a twenty five twenty percent
off coupon code other twenty percent
coupon codes for like everything a lot
of things I'll put all those coupon
codes down below for you okay this one
is also Shran rum and this is a calm
down hand cream this stuff really does
smell good I mean they're talking about
pampering in a box I think they they
nailed it with this it definitely has
that lemony citrusy kind of smell oh I
really like this box so far and then
this is he I don't take baths so
anything having to do with baths I don't
really use I'll pass them along to my
friend who does take baths this is by
somebody and it's a some phizzer
from coconut and cream maybe I'll give
it to my daughter because she likes to
take baths mmm that smells good very
nice and then this is a cure lemon
probiotic radical resurfacing even skin
tone nature's blend of brightening lemon
probiotic and our proprietary organic
matter they that word shy child I look
like an idiot when I try to pronounce
these things and then it ends up being
obvious but it basically it smoothes
your skin's texture shy or Ella
tyrella and it looks like this and it's
filled to about here and again if they
all have similar smells that citrus
see kind of smell but this one smells
more like a lotion so why don't you do
this you apply it under your moisturizer
and then the last things I see are these
little Bath melts and again I don't take
baths but I will pass the one and these
are also by somebody and again that
citrusy kind of smell so if you don't
like a citrusy smell you probably would
not be happy with this but I personally
love it I think it smells amazing so I
am happy with all of these things here
with this box I'm most excited I think
about this spray I'm also excited about
the candle and the lotion here those are
the ones that really make me personally
happy that is a personal preference
thing there's also a bunch of cards in
here 20% off at somebody
SEO turn your shower into a spa
unforgettable aromas in the shower cool
20% off and then a body balm nice 20%
off and then saran rom no parabens no
bad stuff there's a whole list of things
that this stuff doesn't have that's
really cool awesome cruelty free all
that good stuff so they also sent me
this one and I don't know whether this
is another version of the Mother's Day
one or if this is just part of it where
you get two boxes there's a note for me
maybe it'll explain okay let's see it
says hello so the the blue was the
subscription the $33 subscription and
then the white is a current gift so this
is a gift box and that was the
subscription box okay so you guess you
get the choice I'm doing the
subscription or the gift box oh thank
you Ted and Jen that was really nice a
sweet little note cool and then it's got
the products in here just like the other
one and here's the beautiful paper in
this one oh my gosh that is just
gorgeous oh I love it just the little
touches mean so much you know okay so
this is how this one looks inside
beautiful
instead of worms we get peanuts
okay first thing I see who these are
going to be shared with my husband I'm
sure
dark chocolate Sun cups these are called
mint cups yums I know he's so excited
he's over there listening to me film and
it's dark chocolate and mint and our nut
flip free and gluten free and it doesn't
look like there's a whole lot of
ingredients in here which is very nice
and the next thing I see is a Curtis and
Florian some kind of bomb I don't know
what the deal is with this Oh massage
daily into feet baby you want to give me
a foot massage later yeah I think I
think this is gonna be a good thing
let's see what this stuff smells like
I'm excited about this he doesn't seem
very excited about robbing my feet ooh
got some of my lip it's definitely got
that Oh cuz I squirted it all out
medicinal kind of smell to it but it's
not a bad smell and there's two nail
polishes in here uh-huh uh-huh they look
like I was just about to say they look
like spy ritual there are little mini
spa rituals and I love me some spy
ritual I usually have gotten spiral nail
polishes in my boxycharm I do not own
either one of these colors these are
really neat this one is a bright red and
it is called honk hunk of burning love
and this one is called golden golden
rule usually spy rituals are a one to
two coat polish this one looks about the
same
probably a two coat polish on this one
and this is a glitter I'm not gonna drip
test that one but excited to have those
and then this here is a stress relief
roll-on remedy I need some of that give
me some of that stress relief oh it
smells very clean I think Jon my
husband's gonna like this one cuz it
smells clean let's roll it on I could
fall asleep right now it smells nice it
smells almost like baby powder ish
though like a sweet baby powder it
smells good though I'm very excited
about this I don't think I've been a
single thing and you don't one of these
boxes Rob what oh no my ball okay this
is a moisture mist by Senate does okay
--weight Hornet maximizes the delivery
of active ingredients what does that
mean hydrates and heals skin while also
enhancing the spread ability and
penetration
your moisturizer so I guess you spray it
on before your moisturizer so that the
good ingredients and the moisturizer can
really seep into your skin that's kind
of neat I've never heard that before
I know para dense preservatives no
artificial ingredients and it's kosher
for all you people that keep kosher see
how this missed this whew
there's no smell to it no smell which is
nice if you're spring something all over
your face you don't want it to have a
strong smell so that's nice and then
this is Jurlique I think I've heard of
this I think that this is an expensive
brand if I remember correctly it sounds
very fancy schmancy and this is a rose
hand cream and it's a rich hydrating
hand cream my husband loves rose Rose
sets I know I keep talking about
anybody's sitting right over there it's
hard not to talk about him yeah it
smells like roses it smells nice it's
not super strong I mean let me spread
some of this on see how it moisturizes
really rosy yeah it does have a little
bit of an old lady kind of smell seeps
in really nicely though the formula is
nice my hands feel really soft liking
the formula not a big fan of the scent
but that's okay it will get used and
loved and then there's a couple more
things in here this is a crush mask
anti-aging a facial mask and I do not
use facial mess I always pass them on to
my friend Mary Lynn hi man did you get
another mask girlfriend okay so this is
a anti-aging mask and some of my friends
here on YouTube that comment under my
videos encouraged me and encouraged me
to try facial masks again but they
freaked me out
they're cold and they're wet and they're
uncomfortable and I don't know how
people can be relaxed with something
like this on their face because it's
just so it feels really creepy to me so
I pass them along and then the last
thing in here is a level Naturals lemon
verbena candle and it's a soy candle and
we just did science projects in my
fourth-grade class and one of the
science projects was which kind of
candle burns the fastest and they
learned that soy candles burn the
fastest so I told them I said thanks to
them I will not buy anymore soy candles
but this is a sweet candle so I will get
to test it on my own to see if it is
true that this will burn through very
quickly smells really good lemon and
sweetness
and yumminess and it's an all-natural
candle and then I got a card in here
about Sunita's the moisture mist 20% off
so I'll put all that 20% off goodness
down below in case you're interested in
checking out any of these companies or
products I will put them down there but
you know I mean as far as the total
value of this I think if you are a
makeup lover this is and you don't care
about skincare you don't care about bath
products you don't care about candles
this will not be a subscription for you
but if you love skincare products spa
products you know things like that like
pampering yourself kind of making a spa
in your own home if that sounds
appealing to you this may be something
you want to check out because there's a
lot of products in here and these are
all products from smaller companies
companies you won't run into it support
companies you won't run into it the
drugstore you know it's just very unique
that you're not gonna find anywhere else
so I love that about the subscription
that it gives you a unique opportunity
to try products from smaller companies
and yeah I'm really excited about it so
thank you so much to Ted and Jen for
sending me these using boxes I'm really
happy with them and I cannot wait to try
all these products and any of them that
are fantastic or amazing will show up in
my spring favorites which will be coming
up in a few weeks I just I can't do
favorites every month it's just too much
so I'm just going to do them per season
so fantastic products from here will
show up there or in empties videos which
I'm starting to develop at this point
let me see anything else I want to tell
you oh I'm going to be just some a
little announcements I'm going to be on
a blog talk radio show on May 25th at
7:30 p.m. and it is the Derek and Kaye
show it's almost like a morning radio
sounding show they're very funny very
fun and I cannot wait to be on their
show they are going to be allowing call
in so if you're interested in chatting
it up on BlogTalkRadio that's the time
to do it or you can always listen to it
after it's been recorded if you just
want to hear how it went I have a
feeling they're gonna ask me a lot about
my video the truth about making money on
YouTube and being a beauty guru so I'm a
little nervous
about what they're going to ask me about
that hopefully I don't get my YouTube
suspend dad you know we'll see hmm so we
will see about that hopefully everything
goes well I'm crossing my phone another
thing I wanted to tell you earrings
