you want to gift a using box send
someone a little Zen he's saying
everyone's although this busts out with
something about using box to the sound
Oh to the song of I do you want to build

all right hello my friends welcome to my
second use in box opening but I have

joining me I'm gonna be unboxing the
regular subscription and John's gonna be
unboxing is men's subscription using box
is $33 per box and it is shipped out
quarterly these are the boxes that are
available right now until the end of
July I believe and then in August they
ship out another box and then in
November they ship out another box if
you're interested in the men's box you
have to go to the gift a subscription
box and then you just have it shipped to
yourself or whatever man you want to
send it to so that's how that works or
done it's very nicely packaged hmm
that's the using paper Japanese paper
and this is kind of like a spa in a box
is the way that it's marketed the last
time I got a lot of really cool bath
spa-like products so if you really like
creating a spa in your home this is
something you definitely want to keep
watching and see if it's something
that's good for you they did send me a
little note and that's signed from Ted
and Jen who are the creators of using
box this was inspired by their time in
Japan so that's why they cute clewd this
beautiful using paper this is the one
that I got did you show you're using
paper so pretty and you can use it as a
bookmark you make origami out of it very
pretty

Alan hike this is one packet this is 160
calories and inside of this is 27 grams
of sugar yeah definitely
thing one nerds giving you energy yeah
seven grams sugar that's like two candy
bars dude this kind of product is
definitely marketed towards people that
are active this is not you know you're
sitting on your couch and you're eating
snacks right that's not good so if
you're outside you run around you're
gonna you're in a burn that off and
they're gluten free and dairy free for
those of you that have allergies oh and
it says there's 32 milligrams of
caffeine in there so Wow

least like ginseng or something in these
things

laugh me about the
but I have never in my life used a toner
because I don't have a lot of skin
problems and when I did have skin
problems when I was younger I didn't
know anything about it so I've never
used a toner I'm really excited to try
this just to you know see what the
effect it has on my skin it comes out
like a like a watery spray and it smells
it smells a lot like honeysuckle

I'm gonna steal from him you open this
up this is definitely very sweet
smelling pretty nose queens with
conditioner we try to consume it with a
spoon this smell like the other one no
it's definitely a little bit different
it's a little bit different but it has a
similar scent alright next I got the
Michelle derma suitable ultimate lash +
brow serum and if you just saw my spring
favorites video which I will link below
I am addicted not addicted but I'm in
love with rapid lash for a lash serum to
improve the length of my lashes so I'm
curious to try this one by my show and
see if it is just as good as rabid lash
it comes like this and then let's see
and it's a serum got the little you know
the little brush just like rapid lash
does and you apply it to the base of
your eyelashes where I might use this as
my eyebrows I have a space right here of
my in my brow so maybe this will help to
encourage the growth there so maybe I'll
use it there to see whether it works
since it hasn't been affected by
anything at this point so really excited
to try that yay
so the next item in my box is I believe
that is fights men this is a exfoliating
cleansing gel and the past few boxes
that I've gotten I've gotten exfoliating
stuff similar this is a different brand
I haven't tried this yet I've been I've
been having fun using these exfoliator
zhh on my face in the shower because
they make me feel fancy you ever
exfoliated before I started getting
subscription boxes
Birchbox man made me make me exfoliate
nice this has a pleasant scent to it
coming creaminess of it
it comes out white and yeah and I was
like a nice has like an ice cream to it
fine or is it hmm let's see salty yeah a
little chalky but it's pretty fine okey
I mean that you find and as I'm as I'm
rubbing it in its warming up its really
softening up ya know it smells good it's
like that fresh clean kind of scent like
it's kind of smell so I'm really looking
forward to trying that that's why they
put it in a men's box smells like more
manly clean alright next I got the
packaged very beautifully the
aromatherapy lavender body spray by
Kerstin Florian last time I said
something ridiculous that wasn't Kerstin
Florian when I we got something from
them and it is a body spray and it is a
light moisturizer oh it definitely feels
moisturizing it's like a body oil ooh
that feels good feels nice yeah it
smells like straight lavender though so
if you're not a fan of lavender since
you won't enjoy this but I really like
it a lot and I love the way it feels
like I can feel the smoothness of the
oil seeping into my skin's it doesn't
feel overly greasy or anything it's just
kind of wet and suck right into my skin
and it just feels really good so very
excited about this especially at the
texture of it and the way it makes my
skin feel fabulous the next item in my
box is shave with benefits and this is
luxurious botanical shave foam nice mint
plus eucalyptus comes out like the phone
where's that smell I mean it smells like
cucumber a fresh kind of clean smell
it's definitely not ever powering um so
I could I could see you using it on my
face my next product is the Hugo
Naturals handcrafted soap and it's
vanilla and sweet orange I'm personally
not a big bar soap
fan it's too much effort for me I like
to just like I know right
I just like to squirt my in my body with
a bar I
it just it doesn't it doesn't mesh to
the the you know my body isn't flat
thankfully everywhere so I don't um you
know I just I don't know I don't really
like bar soaps a whole lot I'd rather
squirt some product on a sponge and then
rub it all over like that it does smell
really nice it smells like orange and
cleanliness this was kind of overpowered
the scent of my box I really it really
smelled nice that was what I smelled
when I opened the box so very happy
about having this I will definitely try
it
even though bar soaps are not typically
my fiying oh the the last item or items
in my box these are action wipes and
they remove dirt sweat and odor
naturally nice plant derived ingredients
so these are just white bees for adults

nice after you're done running my
cleaners wipe it all down used by
athletes campers travelers and people in
the move our premium sauce is infused
with select natural ingredients that
leave you clean and refreshed and these
are a nine inch by 10 inch wipes that's
a big white hinge once you open it up it
says natural sudsing removes sweat dirt
and odor okay and then my last product
is the aroma flage botanical fragrance
and insect repellent what my little
scared botannical and insect repellent

would choose to wear I'm scared
bug sprays smelling bug spray fragrance
see that's actually surface for really
good I said here's some oh that does
smell good yeah it smells like liquid
sweet hearts it does that smells really
good if this keeps bugs away I will
totally write a full-size of this as
long as it's not like 150 bucks or
something from the Southeast Asian
tropics notes of silken vanilla sweet
orange and warm cedar would naturally
repel soft winged insects you nose like

even kidding like they just suck the
blood out of you I don't even know how I
don't pass out how much I get bitten and
