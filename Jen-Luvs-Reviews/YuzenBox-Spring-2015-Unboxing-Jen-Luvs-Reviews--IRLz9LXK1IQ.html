the spring use in box a little bit about
using boxes and boxes $33 a season it is
a seasonal box this is the Springboks
believe it is still available so I will
link down below in case you see
something that you like and you want to
order this box this box is sent to me
for promotion but i am not paid in any
way to do this other than getting this
box for promotion i do not benefit from
signups so therefore there is no benefit
in me telling you that you must buy this
i will give you an honest review of what
i think of this box and the wonderful
people that own use in box understand
that and they are okay with that which
makes them extra awesome so using box
like i said is thirty-three dollars and
it is all natural organic products
everything is very carefully chosen and
tested it has to basically make it into
the box they have a bunch of things that
they just lay out and try and they have
all these things that they want to put
in people want to put in they put in
submit to put in use in box but they
only pick the best of the best products
to put in I can honestly say it is been
think there's been maybe one product of
the seven or eight using boxes that I've
gotten I think there's maybe been one
product that it didn't enjoy and
honestly I can't even remember what it
was I don't even think there might have
been one product that I didn't enjoy I
love using box if you like a spa in a
box experience or like if your mom or
your grandma or sister your aunt loves
that whole bath spa thing using box is
perfect this will be great for a
Mother's Day gift like really and truly
it's a fantastic subscription and you
can do a one-time purchase or you can do
the subscription it's up to you so when
you open the box you get a little card
that has a little note from Ted and Jen
who are the owners and it has all of the
products inside and not only does it
have the products but it also gives you
a little summary about the product and
then why they chose it you'll see words
like natural organic supporting the
world coco foundation and usda cocoa
research station i don't know what that
means but sounds great it's a woman
owned company and violent mentally
responsible manufacturing no GMO is
parabens
petrolatum sulphates I mean those are
the things you're going to see in the
products in use in box so whenever using
box you get a piece of using paper and
this is just stinking gorgeous so you
can use this as a bookmark you can even
if you're good at word got me make a
little origami out of it I usually use
it as a bookmark and it's just I love
the use of paper I love that they put it
in every time and then here is the pink
paper little tissue paper and then
inside you get some packing peanuts and
everything is put into this bag now I
did unpack this so it's not as
beautifully packaged as it was when I
first got it but everything comes in
this little bag and it's just so
beautifully and lovingly wrap this here
is the coke pure lavender lime hand balm
with a hundred percent natural
ingredients and it smells a little bit
minty it smells very fresh and clean
okay so what you do with this it's
instead of carrying a lotion with you
you just rub it on your hands like this
and then you rub it together and it's
really nice and it is so moisturizing it
almost feels like coconut oil or you
know cocoa butter or something like that
the way that it feels it definitely has
an oil to it but it feels so
moisturizing it really does feel good
and I wish you could smell it it smells
very clean and fresh and it just smells
really nice so coconut coconut oil is
the main ingredient these wax shea
butter cocoa butter lavender oil and
lime oil that is all that's in this and
the smell that I was smelling is
lavender oil so this would be a really
nice oil to rub on your hands right
before bed and then put your hands like
this and go to sleep and have some
sleepy lavender dreams just wonderful so
really really love this product next we
have what is this utopia night cream and
it comes in this pretty little box it's
a decadent moisturizer infused with
hand-harvested native nectars and super
fruits from the deserts of Australia
it's specifically designed to restore
and repair skin while use so I'm just
going to pump a little bit of this out
just to get the feeling of it all I can
smell is that lavender I might have to
wash my hands oh I can smell it now it
smells very creamy it doesn't have a
vanilla set but it's creamy it smells
but it almost reminds me of the sense i
remember from going to
jamaica like in the spas and things in
Jamaica it smells good it smells good
but it's got like a mild like creamy
sent to it it smells good I can't feel
it on my hands I have all that wheel I'm
gonna have to wash my hands and really
give this a test just a minute I'll be
right back so I just went and washed my
hands because I want to give this a true
test of the Utopia night cream and just
kind of feel what it feels like I don't
want to use too much because I'm scared
I'm not gonna be able use it for its
intended purpose it feels very smooth to
put on um yeah very very smooth seeping
in very nicely not a vanilla scent but
almost like a soapy creamy almost like a
frothy milky kind of scent it feels very
very nice as its drying it's a bit tacky
but I can see where this would feel
really nice on the skin to just kind of
finish your face off before you go to
bed so very excited about this and
excited to play with this a bit me yeah
this is a spa in a box you know I'm
saying this is really cool so here we go
this is the this is the spa technologies
of microdermabrasion cream now I don't
have problem skin so I typically pass
off hardcore skincare products to
friends but I do want to tell you a
little bit about this very fresh minty
creamy scent and i'm going to go ahead
and just touch from the cap here i can
already feel the grit to it and i'm
going to just try it on a different part
of my hands and it's got that cooling
sensation and i can feel that grit but
it's a very fine sandy grit and it feels
like it's disappearing the more that I
rub it's definitely well it's still
there it's still there just spreading
out and it really has a nice set almost
kind of reminds me of mint chocolate
chip ice cream but without as much
chocolate like more min T I can imagine
that would feel really good after a long
summer day just we've been sweating all
day and then this is how you like clean
your face and you just feel in that room
decorating freshness like I imagine that
would be amazing i might actually keep
this and not pass it on because it feels
really really good so very excited about
that it just says it's a luck seaweed a
scream that uses tiny pro crystals to
gently exfoliate the skin so i will be
keeping it since its gentle revealing
healthy glowing layer underneath use it
twice weekly after cleansing and also
try it first
softening and hydrating hands well there
you go so I just put it on my hand so
there we go all right so that's another
win for me and then next we have a many
of the spa ritual nail polish and this
is in the shade up at noon and it is an
iridescent pink and show that to you I
know you can see my ring light in the in
the bottle there sorry about that let's
do a quick nail swatch here you know I
just have I get a new polish and it's
like a let's watch it and then they just
put it on here and I have nots watched
this yet it looks at very very thin oh
it's very thin extremely thin so this
right here is one coat and it is
completely translucent I would imagine
this would be a three or four coat
polish for opacity so that's it at two
coats and it is a beautiful iridescent
pink ok that's the polish at three coats
and it's almost opaque almost ok and we
have full opacity at four coats but it
is gorgeous it's just gonna take some
work and some one so I am very thankful
to have this and when I have a lot of
time this spring and summer I might use
this it's just it's very thin and I
guess that just kind of goes along with
a lot of your desa polishes but I've
seen some great iridescent polishes that
are one co polishes especially from any
brand seem to be rocking those out
lately so sparitual should get on their
game it is a natural more natural nail
polish than other nail polishes so maybe
that has something to do with it but it
is a pretty color it just takes some
work and the next thing is this honey
and black sea 24-hour all-natural
deodorant and I have used all natural
deodorants before and I found that they
did not help in the summer time that
they wore off it wore off quickly i used
the toms brand and it just you know i
guess maybe three or four hours in it
was like oh so I guess the all-natural
is not working anymore and it was
embarrassing so I've been a little
scared to try all natural deodorants and
I'm trying to get the top off it smells
good it smells very fresh all the stuff
smells fresh what's the ingredients in
this honey and black seed I definitely
smell the honey in there it smells good
i would imagine this would smell good on
the arms
and combat thats tankiness so i will try
this in the spring to see if it works
before i tested in the summer and
embarrass myself but very think what i
have this and there's a lot of research
about deodorants and caught in this
linked to breast cancer I've heard I
don't know how much truth there is into
it i'm not an expert on it but i have
heard that there are some claims of that
and different things about the
ingredients and deodorants and things
being really really bad for you so an
all-natural deodorant is probably a good
way to go you know I just haven't
ventured into it maybe get a travel size
and put in my purse or something in case
it starts wearing off you know or just
carry a really big purse more stuff in
here this is the inner sense organic
beauty pure harmony hair bath pure
inspiration daily conditioner and it
looks like we've got a conditioner and a
shampoo and there the little mini sizes
and let's just give them a little sniff
who smells good a little citrusy a
little fruity very very nice on the
shampoo I would imagine the conditioner
smells similar and it does and very
excited to use these I am trying to get
into more natural shampoos and
conditioners so really happen to have
these and if I do enjoy these i will be
buying the full size because i am tired
shopping around for shampoo and
conditioner that's all fit free and more
natural because they all stink so least
the ones that i've tried if you have a
suggestion for all natural shampoos and
conditioners or more natural ones let me
know in the comments below because i
have had bad luck so I'm really excited
to try these hopefully they are good
sulfate free daily formula the par-5s
and cleanses with the help of a net of
natural plant sources organic and
biodynamic ingredients gluten-free
cruelty-free no GMOs all of that good
stuff so very excited to try these I do
wish they were a little bit bigger
because I feel like you need more than
one to two uses to really get to know
your shampoo and conditioner so I wish
they were just a little bit bigger okay
next we have date worthy lip lush by a
cure and i really like a cure products
overall very excited about this and go
ahead and swatch you that and it is very
pigmented i have on my melted
metal by Too Faced lip products I'm just
going to put this on over top just cuz
I've had that on for a hot minute my
lips are feeling a bit parched how'd I
do no mirror makeup challenge oh I
actually really really like that i'm
going to high match tomorrow and in real
life time and i may wear this lipstick
with this shirt this looks really really
nice it doesn't feel great it's got a
little bit of an oiliness to it that i
don't enjoy it also has a little bit of
a plastic you smell if you don't like
scented lip products I would not
recommend this but I really like the way
that it looks I think it looks fantastic
and again this is the date worthy lip
lush and it contains our organic argan
oil so that's probably why it feels a
little bit oily and then the final thing
in here that's an actual product is the
shock love toffee and almond milk
chocolate and I have tried this before
and it's amazing and i'm already at my
sugar quota for the day so i'm not going
to try it today but i can tell you it's
how amazing it is a milk chocolate
product and it's just really creamy and
wonderful and i love this stuff so very
thankful to have that it also comes with
a bunch of cards in here introduced in
nubian Heritage's all natural 24-hour
deodorants and it's got a code there for
fifteen percent off that i will put down
below and fall in love with the
beautiful truth in an inner sense

for you any other promo codes that are
in here i will put down below for you in
case you want to use them sharing my
codes share in the love in case you saw
anything amazing that you want to try
out so that's my used in box was this
worth $33 i definitely think so that's
my personal opinion these are all
natural organic products they cost a
little bit more you know what I'm saying
this definitely is worth at least ten
dollars this is worth at least seven I
would say this is probably
are three on its own well maybe two will
say too because it's a small kind the
bigger ones are usually worth three or
four these are probably worth maybe i
will say two dollars for because they're
so so small for the pair this sample I
would say it's probably worth about six
dollars it's very very nice that's for
the microdermabrasion cream for the
night cream we're gonna say night cream
but eight dollars as far as the size of
it because the size is pretty small it's
only point 33 fluid ounces I don't know
yet we'll go ten i think i'm shooting
low on that one for the hand cream this
is probably worth nine dollars and then
this little spa ritual is probably worth
about three so overall very very happy
with this using box i think it's
definitely worth three three dollars
especially for those spa lovers out
there or family members that you know
love this kind of stuff i think they
would really enjoy it for Mother's Day
or sisters day you know if your sister
is a mother or you know you want to give
it as a gift or if you enjoy the stuff
giving it as a gift to yourself tell
your family go out and do something
while you take a little bath and you
know give yourself some treatments and
it's a lot of fun so I thank you so much
