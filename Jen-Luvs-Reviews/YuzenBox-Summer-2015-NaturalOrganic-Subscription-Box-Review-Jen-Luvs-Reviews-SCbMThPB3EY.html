summer unboxing actually I've already
unbox that I've already kind of looked
through the things I haven't had a whole
lot of time to try everything in it we
just moved as you can see looks a little
different in here but I did want to go
over what was in the summer box because
I I wanted you to have a chance to order
it if you were interested in it all the
information on how much used in box
costs and subscription options things
like that are down in the description
this is set to me for review so I just
wanted to let you know that I did not
pay for this box but that does not
influence my review at all
now using boxes advertised as a spa in a
box now if you are interested in organic
and natural skin care hair care you know
makeup things like that then this might
be a subscription for you everything in
here is very meticulously chosen by Ted
and Jen the owners of use in box so very
important to know that that you are
going to be getting high-quality
hand-picked items so this is the first
time I've ever gotten a use in box in
this brown packaging they wanted to go a
little bit more eco-friendly they do
have gift subscription boxes the gift
subscription boxes will still be in the
pretty white boxes but this is the
regular subscription box so this one is
going to be coming in the eco-friendly
packaging usin box is a quarterly
subscription so you get one box every
three months and this box cost $33 so
every box does come with this beautiful
using paper I always use them for
bookmarks light weight uses them for
bookmarks everyone in my family uses
these for bookmarks because they're so
beautiful now they've got this one kind
of tape to the paper as kind of a handle
to open your tissue paper isn't that
cute inside here there are some coupons
this year is for shea moisture it's $1
off and I believe they sell these at
Target and some other drugstores so
that's kind of cool to get a coop
for that and then also we got a Roma
Floria wellness in bloom this is just an
information card and also if you use
code use him
you'll get 20% off of your order at a
Roma Floria calm if there's any coupon
codes or anything in in here I will be
putting them in the description so you
can take advantage of those as well this
card is very very useful it not only
tells you about the products but also
tells you why Ted and Jen chose the
products what makes them awesome for
example this is a Roma flage botanical
fragrance insect repellent and it talks
about that it's an all-natural way to
stay bug free without harsh chemicals no
sulfates parabens petrolatum synthetic
fragrances cruelty free ethically
sourced supports indigenous communities
discount code use an 18 percent off at
aroma flush comm so every single product
has information like that about each one
and there's also some products on the
back so you do get quite a few products
oh there's one more thing in here
this is sun sun tegrity natural healthy
holistic sun sun care and one thing I've
learned recently this summer is how many
horrible ingredients there are in the
typical Sun care so this is an option if
you want a more natural Sun care so I'm
assuming we got some products from this
brand let's go ahead and look Oh yup
here we go now this for whatever reason
does not have the top on I don't know if
I did that or what I might have done
that this is the Sun Tegra 5 in one
moisturizing face a sunscreen okay and
then this is it says treat hydrate
protect prime and cover it is a tinted
sunscreen I'm gonna go ahead and open
this so that you can see what the tint
looks like it looks very very light so
if you are a medium or deeper skin tone
this will probably not be tinted for you
we'll have to see hopefully it wouldn't
cause a cast on your skin but as far as
it being tinted it's very very lightly
tinted I mean this is like a super pale
skin tone here I'm not really sure about
that but it's vegan non greasy and non
toxic and you do oh this is in the shade
fair that makes sense
have different versions for different
skin tones hopefully they have a nice
variety of skin tones which ought to
check their website to see but that's
very exciting very happy to have that
and then next we got lunula this is the
aroma Floria mineral mussel soaked ocean
mineral bath salts and this is in the
scent eucalyptus peppermint and lemon
brats lemongrass this is a that scent
eucalyptus peppermint and lemon grass it
soothes sprains and aching joints so
that'll be very nice my husband gets
some arthritis kinds of feelings in his
hands sometimes so this will be really
nice for him to kind of soak in the tub
and ache you know all this
aches after tattooing all day this would
be really nice for him you know it
smells a lot like eucalyptus if and
really smell that eucalyptus but I can
also definitely smell the peppermint and
the lemongrass in here as well
it's hard to present vegan no animal
testing safe for the planet very nice so
very excited to have this and this does
appear to be a full-size that is quite a
bit of product next up this one's
definitely a full-size this is the Shea
Moisture replenish and rejuvenate hand
cream with black pearl protein and sea
buckthorn oil and it says skin renewal
recipe
10% of shea moisture goes to community
commerce so that's kind of cool let's go
ahead and try this feels very very thick
there's that let's rub that in smells
good um it definitely doesn't have the
same kinds of sent as the bath salt that
clean refresh it's got a sweetness to it
um like an herbal sweetness I don't know
how to describe that but it feels
amazing it's seeping in very nicely
doesn't feel oily at all and I believe
this is a drugstore brand let me see if
it says the price is here I don't think
that it does let me say I don't think
that this provides the prices no it
doesn't but I do believe this is a
drugstore brand it feels amazing very
very slightly floral but it's not sweet
like candy it's more sweet like on like
natural sweets like something you would
find in like a very sweet smelling
flower
smells great I really really like this
product a lot
I am surprised how much I love that and
I can barely even feel it on my hands
now my hands just feel super moisturized
very excited about that and I've tried
other things from the shea moisture
brand and really enjoyed them okay next
up
it says aroma flage with wild oh this is
the mosquito repellent so it's in a
little perfume vial
let me spray it on me and it smells like
mosquito repellent it doesn't it doesn't
smell like menthol I'm like loading it
to my nose like it's gonna smell like
perfume it smells like a mosquito
repellent but it's not offensive
mosquito repellent doesn't smell like
all for something like that you know the
hardcore leg guy at the drugstore kinds
of brands of mosquito repellent smells
nice it doesn't really smell like
citronella though it says free of DEET
chemicals and parabens a blend of
cardamom cedar wood and spruce so very
cool so we are about to go to the beach
actually so I'm going to bring this with
us because when we go to I'm shooting
Island Virginia there tend to be
mosquitos there so this will be nice to
bring with us on our trip whoa I just
flung across the room didn't it but this
will be nice I can't hold on to anything
okay
moving on we have a little mini spa
ritual nail polish and using box does
tend to have quite a few spy ritual nail
polishes we get one almost every month
but that doesn't bother me because I
like spa ritual this is in the shade
strike a pose and it looks to be from
you can kind of see through the brush
there so I would say this is either a
two to three coat polish but it's a
beautiful pink shade I really like that
color it's almost like a Barbie pink but
not quite as brights and light and
bright but it's on the edge of like a
Barbie pink so that's really pretty and
then this is a more natural formula of
nail polish they sell that at Ulta this
year this is kind of interesting this is
organic hard candy and this is Meyer
lemon and raspberry you get this tin
here and this is by Tori and Howard
they're 12 calories each and it says
natural fruit flavors I love these
little tins I always want to save them
but like what am I going to use this tin
for and they come in these little
wrapped
saying something unwrapped one for you I
don't think I'm gonna eat one now
because that would just be up not just
for me to be sucking on a hard candy
while we took the video I did have one
when I first received the box and I
really enjoyed it it tastes exactly like
you would imagine a lemon raspberry
candy to taste and that's what that
looks like and they're they're really
good I mean they're they're just nice
nice hard candies this is nice for me to
keep in my car in case I get the
munchies or you know get a little sleepy
in the car sometimes when I'm driving I
get like a little bit like if I've
specially haven't gotten good sleep I
get a little tired and having a little
bit of sugar kind of like give me a
little burst of energy so I can get
where I'm going the number one
ingredient is organic sugar and then
organic rice syrup and then non-gmo
citric acid and then natural flavor so
it is pretty much 100% sugar in here and
it looks like there's 14 grams of sugar
in 5 pieces so if you just have one
that's not going to give you nearly as
many grams of sugars so that's pretty
nice excited to have that and then next
we have the elastic smells organic lip
balm and I'm gonna go ahead and put that
over the top of my lip product this is
colourpop's ouija in case you were
wondering I've been encouraged by a lot
of people watching my videos to wear a
brighter lip color so hopefully
hopefully I'm pulling it off pretty well
I like it okay so let's go ahead and I
found pairing a lip balm with with matte
lipsticks really gives me a
moisturization without killing the match
it really kills the matte finish when
you put a gloss over top but if you use
a lip balm it just gives this very very
tiny bit of shine and helps your lips a
moisturize now as I put this on I
definitely feel that minty flavor not
mentholated but a minty feeling that
tingly mint enos it smells very minty
and it feels really really good feels
very moisturizing and let's see if it
changed the finish of the lipstick it
doesn't seem like it did so that's kind
of nice you know and I'm always up for
new lip balms it says smile for a cause
every purchase supports cleft lip and
palate surgery so that's really cool
it's always nice to see brands that give
back to people from their profits so I
always like to support brands like that
this next is the Jurlique it purely age
defying firming
and tightening cream I've tried a lot of
Jurlique products I don't believe I've
ever tried this one so I'm very excited
to try this one you just um it's you put
it all over your face morning and night
so I am excited to try this and this
because you put it all over your face
this probably won't last as long as I
would hope I'm trying to look and see in
my leg to see if I can see how much
products in there it is 0.16 fluid
ounces I wish this was a little bit
bigger but I am excited to try that and
then here's the top to that one product
yeah okay and then the last thing in
here is this Hugo natural shower gel and
I tried the Hugo natural soaps before
from using box and I really really liked
them a lot
it is the vanilla and sweet orange scent
which is the same scent that I tried in
their bar soap and I really love the bar
soap so I'm very happy to have this and
the show I prefer shower gels over bar
soaps so I'm this is going straight into
my shower and I will be using and this
the Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and all of those
those shower gels really do have a lot
of chemicals in them so this is a really
nice alternative if you don't want to
put as many chemicals on your skin so
very excited about that alright so for
$33 we got me Sun and Sun tegrity five
and one natural moisturizing face
sunscreen and this is tinted we also got
the sample of the Hilo natural shower
gel in vanilla and sweet orange we got
the aroma Floria muscle soap ocean
mineral of bath salts and eucalyptus
peppermint and lemongrass
we got the organic hard candy by Tory
and Howard we got these sample of the
Jurlique purely age defying firming and
tightening serum and the spa ritual a
nail a lacquer and then the full-size
shea moisture Zen's of our marine
complex replenish and rejuvenation hand
cream and two more things the lasting
smiles organic lip balm and finally a
little sample of the natural bug
repellents by aroma flage wild there we
go so overall my opinion of this box I'm
excited about the products in this box
I feel like personally from
this box is worth $33 but I don't think
it's worth much more than $33 I feel
like if you really like spa type
products you will enjoy this but I feel
like with the best most exciting most
valuable products in here being the
drugstore Shea Moisture hand cream and
the aroma Floria muscle soak I feel like
these being like the most exciting
things in there are $33 subscription box
I would really like to see something
that is a little more exciting as like
the main item like I'm looking for like
that that Wow item and I don't really
see the wow what I do on the flipside
really do think this is worth $33 if you
add all of this up also with the
experience of trying all of these
natural and organic skincare and nail
polish and body products and things like
that so are interested in ordering in
this particular use in box I will put

know if they gave me a discount code I'm
