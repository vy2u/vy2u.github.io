hello my friends welcome to the winter
you is in box unboxing using box sends
this to me for review but that does not
influence my review at all as it never
does I did want to show you this very
quickly before I even had a chance to
try everything because this box is only
available for a limited time use some
boxes sent out four times a year it is
$119 for for seasonal boxes or you can
buy them thirty-three dollars apiece do
it I do believe this is a US only
subscription it is for natural and
organic products so I do feel like that
kind of factors into the costs a little
bit in the natural organic products tend
to cost more there is a gift
subscription box that you can buy as
well that I believe that Ted told me the
owner of using box said that all of the
products are new to use in box they've
never been featured in using box before
so it's a really special box is
thirty-six dollars and it is available
now let's go ahead and get into what is
in the winter box so that you know what
you're getting this is not one of those
where it varies from box to box
everybody gets the same thing so you'll
be able to see today what you would get
now the way that this is packaged and of
course I already opened it cuz I had to
peek is it's got this beautiful tissue
paper and then this is the use in paper
it can be used for origami can be used
for a bookmark it's just always this
beautiful use of paper and they use it
as kind of a handle to open your box and
then when you open your box you get this
a little mesh bag with packing peanuts
and all of the products inside so the
only product that I've tried so far is
this 18 sleep it says sleepless try a
teen sleep for sleep benefits in one
quiet your mind feel relaxed and minish
anxiousness and achieve restful sleep
who it says roll-on inhale and transform
I'm assuming that there are many other
different kinds of sense but this
aromatherapy is specifically for sleep
and I do have trouble sleeping sometimes
and I don't know if this contributed to
helping me sleep but I do enjoy it and I
like it I like the way that it smells it
smells um it smells very fresh and
herbal
and clean a guy you I would expect to
smell more lavender II but I don't
really smell a whole lot of lavender in
it and it is one hundred percent natural
potent plant extracts nourishing organic
haha but oil to deliver targeted
benefits for a healthier mind and body
and I am very much enjoying this the
next thing that's in here is this here
this is a Salas organic lotion bar in
lemongrass and it is one hundred percent
natural certified organic ingredients
and it smells exactly the way that you
would imagine and it smells like lemon
grass it's got a very very strong lemony
scent it's made primarily of beeswax and
cocoa butter then there's also coconut
oil shea butter natural sunflower oil
and since that is all it is in this so
very excited to try that feeling it it
feels very moisturizing and very excited
to use that I have not used it yet next
up is a product that they have set in
use in box before this is a sent us
sanitas sanitas oil free moisturizer
this is a very nice moisturizer I have
used it before and I have used it up and
I have enjoyed this I'm going to spray
just squirt just a little bit on my
hands just to give you so that I can
feel how it feels because it's been a
while but i do remember enjoying this it
seeps into the skin very quickly does
not feel oily or greasy in any way it
just feels moisturizing and then it
feels a little wet and then it dries and
then just feel soft so very very nice
here the next thing is a nail polish
it's called Black Dahlia lacquer it's a
vegan 5 free nail polish it is eight
milliliters and this one is a pink with
some pink glitter in it it's a very very
thick to look at I'll get out my swatch
wheel and we can swatch it so you can
see I just watched the nail polish on my
swatch wheel this one is two coats this
is one coat so you could probably get
away with one coat but to kotas I think
looks nicer I'm not sure if the light is
picking up the sparkle in there but I in
real life I can really see the sparkle
hopefully you can too it's very very
pretty you can definitely see it in the
bottle I mean that that's shimmer is
just crazy I don't feel it comes out
that opaque in the
in the swatch but you can definitely see
so far this nail polish looks very nice
of course I can't speak to wear times I
haven't worn it on my nails yet but it
does look very nice in the swatch all
right next up we got a product from a
brand called level of naturals and this
is a brand that my husband John really
likes a lot this is a shower bomb
inorganic menthol and cucumber and it is
a relaxed scent which sounds very very
nice and it smells amazing it really
does it smells like menthol and cucumber
it's exactly what it smells like like I
can't describe it any better you get to
little shower bombs there and that's
very exciting to me because that just
like end of the day shower throw this in
the shower and get that you know
cleaning out your sinuses thing if
you've got allergies or got a cold or
something this will be perfect another
thing that I'm very excited about is if
you know me you know i'm a huge
chocolate fan this is the green Earl
Grey sixty percent cacao organic
chocolate fusion dark chocolate it is a
gourmet dark chocolate infused with a
refined blend of bergamot and green tea
from a brand called the Tea Room I am
not the hugest fan of tea I'm a little
scared of this it is dark chocolate from
Europe is what it says and the number
one ingredient is organic unsweetened
chocolate and then sugar let me open
this because I want to try this and see
if it's good there's definitely dark
smooth creamy chocolate squares like
that just go for it
not a fan I will tell you this I'm a
huge fan of milk chocolate with like
caramel and sea salt and things like
that if you like a deeper chocolate more
complex chocolate more mature chocolate
then let's say our cheese kiss you may
enjoy this I don't think I'm mature
enough for this it's got him an odor to
it as you eat it like a tea burger mom
odor like almost they do have lots of
other flavors they do have lots of
labor's give chamomile and honey they
have black masala chai jasmine pina
colada see pina colada I might dig
raspberry rooibos I probably would love
because I love that kind of tea midnight
mocha almond caramel I wish that they
had included one of those instead of the
green Earl Grey not my style girlfriend
now my style old boyfriend all right
next up we got the coke your facial
scrub and mask it's a two-in-one when
you look at it it looks like baby powder
at the top and this was one of those
that you pat into your hand you add a
little bit of water you make a scrub out
of it and then you scrub your face I
again I have not used this yet but I can
kind of Pat some out on my hands so you
can see it's like a like a muddy green
kind of color and it is just a very fine
powder and then you just mix that with a
little bit of water so the sense is a
little bit earthy but not overpowering
it's very mild at least in the powder
form it's very my own oh this is the
raspberry rule both let's try that one
from the tearoom we got to try that one
that one sounded really good let's try
that these little chocolate drops I
guess they didn't want to include two
bars but they wanted to try it two
different flavors mm-hmm that one is
much better it definitely has that tea
flavor but the raspberry is much more
pleasant aroma and this is one of those
chocolates that you can smell it in your
sinuses as you eat it and it smells very
nice I wish that they had this bar in
there cuz this one's actually really
good
it's very unique very unique it's an
experience all right and then the last
thing in here is the Kimberly Perry
organics for body scrub sweet orange and
cranberry and when you open this up it
just looks like straight sugar and this
would be a great exfoliant four feet I
would imagine because it is just rough
straight up sugar and it smells very
orangie the orange is really dominant in
the set and it's just it's just a sugar
scrub it's like sugar so that'll be fun
to play with as like a course scrub you
know when you need a scrub and like no
joke scrubbing it out so overall as far
as this box goes you no idea I always
feel like using boxes worth thirty three
dollars just for the experience of
trying these things and it's it's
different than other subscription boxes
and if you have someone that loves
natural and organic products in your
life this may be a great gift for them
this is per case some people may enjoy
that some people may not this is a
wonderful moisturizer this smells
amazing these bath bombs smell amazing
this moisture bar seems like it's going
to be very nice lotion bar the sleep
thing is might be gimmicky but it might
actually work for some people I do like
it I do like it I just don't know if it
was really working or not I don't know
the nail polish seems very very nice if
you like facial scrubs and masks you may
really enjoy this this isn't this
product isn't a for my personal style
but I know a lot of people love things
like this and then the last thing was
the the sweet orange scrub so I think if
I saw this on the bots on a shelf for
thirty-three dollars for the right
person I would buy this definitely they
say that it's worth $64 retail price and
that I do believe I thank you so much
