- Hey guys, so I just
sent Ben off to London.
He is gonna be there for
several days, like over a week.
And so I've got the house to myself
and, ugh, I am feeling sad.
I'm definitely gonna miss him,
but this is gonna be a good opportunity
for me to just catch up with work,
catch up with friends I
haven't seen in a while.
So yeah, I am about to get ready.
I'm going to a BECCA event.
They are partnering with me for this video
and I'm gonna take you
guys along to the event.
I'm gonna drink this as I get ready.
This is, I don't know,
it's kinda like La Croix, but not.
It's definitely a lot more sweet.
This drink is so frickin' good!
So this is the BECCA Be A Light Palette
and I just used this blush right over here
and I just topped it off
with this highlighter
on the left side.
And this is definitely like
a buildable highlighter.
I love it, it's definitely for everyday.
Well as you can see my
highlighter's poppin'.
So I just put a poll on
Instagram asking you guys
should I wear the black top tonight
or the white top tonight.
We shall see what the results are.
All right, it looks like the
white top has won by 59%.
So this is the top on.
I paired it with this black skirt
and I like the way it looks.
So we're gonna head on out.
I'm gonna feed Chippo and
I'm gonna be on my way.
She knows it's dinner time.
(upbeat music)
All right, it is Amy and Jen!
We're here at Isabel for the BECCA event.
Amy is very excited.
- Sure thing!
- Yes!
(upbeat music)
Good morning everybody!
It is the next day.
I just wanted to say that
I had such a great time
at the BECCA event.
One really cool thing that we did
was we all did like a meditation
exercise before dinner
and it was it was so awesome
because we all closed our
eyes, and we breathed,
and we hummed.
And after that exercise everyone
just felt a lot more loose
and I think it's because
we just had enough oxygen
in our brains and it just
really calmed everything down.
But it was such a beautiful
event with delicious food,
wonderful people,
and just a gorgeous
palette being released.
But today is the next
day and my living room
is such a mess because today I am filming
the Eggie Haul video.
So my videographer,
Krislynn, is gonna come in
and she's gonna help me film everything
and yeah, I am really excited to do this.
I'm wearing one of the dresses right now.
(clicking)
We've got the lovely Ms. Krislynn!
- Hi!
- She is my videographer
and video editor sometimes.
She's incredible.
(mellow music)
(crowd chatting)
Hello!
- Hi.
- I'm vlogging for you.
- Wow!
- I'm getting the exact
same thing Amy is getting.
It's so good, it tastes like Go-Gurt.
So here I am with Eric and he
made a rendering of my office
and he's about to turn my vanity
into a lovely shade of gray.
Oh my gosh, do you want to
do a little walk-through
of this office?
- Sure!
Nice little shelving and
sitting for your desk area.
- [Jen] What would you call
this style of interior design?
- [Eric] It's a little
Scandinavian rustic.
Rustic Scandinavian (laughs).
- [Jen] With graphic pops, right?
- [Eric] That's what we're gonna call it,
with a graphic pop.
- [Jen] Look at all this
storage I will have!
- [Eric] For all your jewelry.
- [Jen] Oh my God, it's so good.
Can you show them the other room?
- [Eric] Yes, so the other option
is having a cement wall.
- [Jen] Ooh, this is a
total Downtown LA vibes.
This is like Drew Scott's apartment.
It looks so cute.
Oh by the way, this is Eric Garcia,
my lovely interior designer.
- Hello.
- Good morning everybody!
I just finished my meeting with Eric.
I've been meeting with
Eric for around a month now
and it's been so incredible.
He is such a talented interior designer.
He's done Kristal's office,
Sincerely Jewels place,
I believe, so I know I'm in good hands.
And I love my home but
there are just some finishes
that I just don't know what to do.
Like the amount of things
that are out on the web,
I just don't even know
where to get started
so I wanted to hire a professional
so he would have the eye.
And it's been such a cool experience.
I can't wait for you guys
to see the finished house.
I think after that I'll feel
comfortable doing a house tour.
I have to go to the West
Side for a few meetings today
but I just cooked lunch.
Made a easy zucchini and broccoli stir-fry
and I just threw an egg
in there at the end.
I just basically put in
any type of vegetables
that were inside my fridge
and this is what I'm gonna have for lunch.
I'm just gonna spray sriracha all over it.
(mellow music)
Hi guys, I am currently on the way back
from the YouTube space.
It is such a cool office!
I met Audrey for the first time
who is my connect at YouTube.
Now I am on my way to dinner.
Emily's moving away which frickin' sucks.
We'll see her like every week,
or like every like two weeks or so,
because there's my bachelorette coming up
and then my bridal shower and
then the wedding of course.
So we'll still see her but I don't know.
We wanted to send her off with
a nice dinner or something
so we're gonna go to a
vegetarian spot called Elf.
I love it there.
Ben and I have been on
a couple of dates there
and it's super-romantic
and the food is bomb.
Driving to the West Side
just totally ate my entire day.
I left at like two and now it's 5:43.
So, mmm!
Ahh!
(laughing)
Aww, I love it!
- I love Jen in this picture!
- [Woman] I love this, let me see!
- [Woman] It's my favorite!
(mellow music)
- Good afternoon everyone.
I am currently making
Aimee Som's raw bar recipe.
So I've already mixed the
oats, the sunflower seeds,
and also I put steel cut oats.
I just put the oven on
350 so it's gonna preheat.
And I also have my coconut
oil in this steaming pot
because I need a fourth of a cup of that.
So yeah, I'm gonna make this
because I think it'll be fun
and that way when I am back home
I have just like a yummy treat to eat.
And I can't wait to show it to you guys!
This will be my third time making them
so we'll see how I do this time.
So I just got my coconut oil
and I'm just gonna put
it into the mixture.
So I'm just gonna coat
everything with the coconut oil
and then I'm gonna put
it on the parchment paper
and it's just gonna cook inside the oven
until it's nice and golden brown.
(paper crinkling)
So now I'm gonna pop this
in the oven for 15 minutes.
So now I'm gonna get some dates
and I'm going to cut 12 of them.
Dates are so sweet it
literally tastes like candy.
15 minutes has passed
and now it's just that
delicious nutty aroma.
(paper crinkling)
I just put all the dates
in here and I just mix.
So now I'm gonna add some
walnuts into the mix.
Oh my God.
(banging)
Scoop it in here.
(paper crinkling)
Now I'm just gonna put this
in the freezer for an hour.
Roo!
I'm here with the lovely Julia.
We've got our iced tea, unsweetened.
- Yes, yes.
- Cheers!
(laughing)
All right, so we are back home.
It's been an hour.
I'm gonna take the raw
bars out of the freezer
and show you what they look like.
Wow!
Cut it up.
Do you want to say hi?
Julia's here as well.
- Hi!
- Hi.
(laughing)
Okay, she's gonna sample.
- Am I the taste tester?
- Yes!
- Okay.
- Okay, I'll give you...
I'll give this piece, okay.
- [Julia] Mmm!
- [Jen] Are you allergic to nuts?
- Uh uh.
- Okay, good.
I was like there's so many nuts in here.
- [Julia] After I ate it?
(laughing)
- [Jen] Having a little
dinner reunion with my love.
- Yes!
- Pumpkin Baby!
- Ah yes, that's some pumpkin baby.
Got my gnocchi, a peach salad,
and some seared sea bass.
- [Jen] Yum, and we're
actually at the restaurant
call Blacksmith's.
- Blacksmith's.
- [Jen] Yeah, it's so cute.
Look at the decor, love it.
(people chatting)
- [Woman] What if you did a ponytail?
- I wouldn't wear it.
- No?
No I don't!
- Cookie!
Look at baby Knobs.
- Happy Knobbie!
- [Jen] Everyone's so happy!
Chickie has friends.
This is Money's belated
13th birthday party,
- Yes!
- [Jen] Slash Wahlie and
Wa's home housewarming.
- Slash Memorial Weekend barbecue.
- [Jen] Dang, this is
a triple threat today.
- Yeah, uh huh.
(laughing)
- [Jen] The boys are making
or cookin' the barbecue.
Hello!
- Hello!
- [Jen] Wow, nice deck guys!
- The answer is, you
don't have a wild guess?
- One, two, three, Pompeii!
- Hello, today is Memorial Day.
Hanging out with Oma and Apa.
They just helped me clean the entire house
and now they are feeding me.
Oma made Kimpa and this is potato ramen.
So let's give this a go.
(speaking in foreign language)
So we are at the Beverly Center.
We're doing some light shopping.
I'm trying to get my mom
a dress for the wedding.
(laughing)
Yeah, so we are.
The colors that I want
everyone in my bridal party
is like a light pink
color, so wish us luck.
(upbeat music)
It's so beautiful.
(hair dryer roaring)
(laughing)
It looks spotless.
Look what we've done here.
We did a glossing?
- It's a glossing!
- This is the glossing.
Dang, how luscious.
- It's so pretty.
- I'm back to the dark side.
- Ya girl.
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.
- All right, we're ready
for New York, baby.
All right, so I'm back home now
and I just finished packing.
Or I am trying my best
to finish up packing.
I am going to New York tomorrow
and I only want to bring
one carry on and a backpack.
And so I've got all my outfits.
I had to put like five or six Eggie pieces
from the new summer collection
because we're doing press.
And I've got my makeup in
this bag and my jewelry case.
This is amazing by the way.
This is how I store my
jewelry when I'm traveling.
And it's basically like a little case
where there's little individual bags
so I can put my earrings.
Honestly it's all earrings.
That's the only jewelry I pack.
But yeah, it's all in this lovely case.
Over here I've laid out my airport outfit.
I think I'm just gonna go
with some comfy denim jeans,
my new Eggie top, and then a hoodie
and also this blazer from Storatz.
Oh my gosh, we are home.
I am laying down.
I finished packing.
My house is so spotless.
I know firsthand how lucky
I am that I have parents
who are willing to drive
out here on a holiday
and volunteer to clean my house.
My mom really wanted to get
her dress for the wedding.
She was kinda stressing out about that.
So yeah, we went to The Beverly Center
and that was kind of like a dud.
There was nothing there.
The Bloomingdale's had some styles
but they were all quite young.
My mom wanted, she has like
a vision for her dress.
Like she wanted it to be long.
She wanted to be covered up here.
Bloomie's didn't have anything
and so we went across
the street to Saks Fifth,
like Fifth Off.
It's basically where all the
discounted designer goods go
from Saks and it was incredible.
My mom walked in and she saw the mannequin
and she was like I want this dress.
And so we took it off and she loved it.
It felt good to just go with a
mission and then complete it.
So yeah, it was great.
And then I got my hair done.
But yeah, I'm gonna go to sleep now
and tomorrow we're gonna go to New York.
(upbeat music)
So I just checked in to the
11 Howard and I love my room!
I have stayed at this hotel before
and right now it's sunset
and so all the light is
dribbling into the room
and it's so romantic and ethereal.
Oh my goodness, and there is rose.
There's two cups so I should
invite Ashley over to my room
and I've got a little note here for me.
What's in here?
Oh, got some Evian bottles.
Are these sparkling?
Oh nice, okay.
So I've got some bottles of water
and oh, The Complete Cookie, yum!
All right guys, we made it
to New York five hours later.
I actually slept the entire
time I was on the plane.
I was supposed to open my
laptop, get some stuff done,
but literally I read
two chapters of the book
that I'm reading on my Kindle
and I just knocked the F out.
So yeah, we are here in New
York for the Harper's Bazaar
Get Unready With Me Shoot.
We're filming that tomorrow
and I'm so excited and honored
that they decided to have me
on the series.
I'm heading to the Apple Store now
because I actually forgot my card reader
and I really want to edit
so I'm gonna head on over to
the Apple Store, grab that,
and then Ash and I are
gonna have some dinner.
(mellow music)
I bought it!
Okay guys, I am back in my hotel room
chugging some water before going to bed
and finishing up a bunch of emails
because your girl fell asleep
for a really long time on the plane.
So I'm just catching up with work
but it is now past midnight
and I think I'm gonna go to bed.
I've got such a long day tomorrow.
I'm a little terrified for my life
but I know once we're there
and we're banging them
out, I'll be totally fine.
(mellow music)
Good morning guys.
So it is eight a.m.
and I'm about to chug
this entire thing of Evian
before I start on my coffee
because I know a couple of years ago
that it's really bad for your stomach
if you just hit it with
coffee the first thing.
The nutritionist said that you
should have breakfast first
or, I mean next best thing,
is to drink some water
and so that way your
stomach has something in it
before you load it with caffeine.
So I'm just gonna chug this.
One talent I have is chugging water.
But yeah, last night I couldn't
sleep until like three.
I think it's because
of the time difference
and because I'm in a new bed.
I think that is the culprit.
All right, so I am wearing
the exact same outfit
as I was yesterday night
but I changed to top.
This is also from Eggie,
my new collection.
(upbeat music)
All right guys, knocked
three meetings down
and we're back in the hotel room.
They all went super-well
and I'm very happy and
pleased with myself.
My energy level is feeling pretty good
and now I'm back in the hotel room
and the 11 Howard just upgraded
my room into the penthouse,
so this is it.
This is the living room.
Over here we've got a rolling rack
where I'm gonna display my
summer Eggie collection.
And check out this stunning cityscape!
Ugh, I am a sucker for skylines like this.
We've got a little powder room
where our guests can use the restroom.
And I love the bathroom
hardware at the 11 Howard.
It's just so modern and clean and minimal.
And this room over here
we've got the bedroom.
We've got a very cushy
large California King bed
which I'm gonna sleep
very well on tonight.
And then of course the master bathroom.
So this is where I'll be getting unready
with Harper's Bazaar.
I'm so fricking excited!
30 minutes until the crew shows up
so I'm just gonna hang
my clothing on the rack
and I'm just gonna steam everything
so everything's nice and prepared.
(mellow music)
- [Man With Beard] But
then you be in that.
- [Photographer] Why don't
you come look at the shot?
- All right guys, just finished
the Harper's Bazaar shoot
and it went so well.
I basically just got unready
and showed my current skincare routine
and now my face has all the product on
but I just drew some eyebrows on
and now I'm gonna go out for dinner.
It is 9:30 but I am starving.
I'm still on LA time.
It is 6:30 there so gonna
go get some Chinese food
and get this belly filled.
Good morning you guys.
I just finished packing.
Today is my last day in New York.
I am leaving at four o'clock.
My flight's at seven.
But this morning I woke up quite early
because I had to get ready.
And so I got myself a
delicious almond milk latte
and I'm gonna say this
is a big treat for me
because I usually always
order black coffee
but I felt adventurous today.
Today's also a special day
because we are dropping the
Eggie Summer Collection!
It's so crazy to be three
hours ahead in New York
because I have to launch
the video at one p.m. here
and then it'll be 10 a.m. in California.
My parents are looking
after Cheekie while I'm away
and Ben comes back on Friday morning.
Or actually he comes back on Friday night
but it's been like two
weeks since he's been gone
and so it's been like two
weeks of being independent
but I freakin' miss him
and it's gonna be so nice
to finally see him again.
And it's good that I've
just been kind of super-busy
and so has he,
because we've just been drowning in work.
But I can't wait to hang out with him
and get some real good
quality time with him
over the weekend.
So it'll be so nice.
So I see the light at
the end of the tunnel.
It's so close I could almost taste it.
(mellow music)
All right guys, I am at the airport.
The meetings all went well
and I can't believe my 48
hours in New York is over.
And today is also, May 31st,
so it is the end of the vlog.
Eggie dropped, summer
collection is officially out.
Please check the description
box for the link.
You can shop everything there
and I'll leave a link to the Eggie haul
and the look-book out in the cart.
So please go check it out.
I want to thank you guys
so much for watching
and supporting and I'll see
you guys in the next one!
Bye! Muh!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
