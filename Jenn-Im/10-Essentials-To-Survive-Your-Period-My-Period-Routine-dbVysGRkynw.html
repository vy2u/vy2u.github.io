- Hey everyone.
It's your girl, Jenn, and today's video
is something that I have
never made a full video about,
which is surprising because
it's something that I've had
for almost two decades now.
Yes, I am talking about my period.
It is something that happens every month
and it is, honestly, not my favorite time,
but a girl's gotta make do.
I am so happy to be partnering with Rael
to talk about my top 10 period essentials
so let's start the countdown.
So at the top of the list,
I want to talk about pads.
I might be in the minority here,
but I actually prefer
using pads over tampons.
I will use tampons,
but I just prefer pads,
especially if I'm just at home
chilling, when I'm sleeping,
if I'm doing light
errands, I'll use a pad.
And my favorite ones
are these ones by Rael.
I have spoken about this in
a monthly favorites before
and these are their
organic cotton cover pads.
These pads are very comfortable
and they provide a lot of
coverage, which I love.
The packaging is incredible as well.
The wrapper is in a cloth-like material,
so they're really quiet and discrete
so that way, if you're
in a public restroom,
you're not like (imitates rustling paper).
It's not the entire world has to know
that you're on your period.
I love Rael's mission statement.
They want to inform women
of the toxic chemicals
that are found in conventional
feminine care products.
And these chemicals are like acetone,
which is nail polish remover,
styrofoam, chemicals in tires.
It's just not safe for these
things to be inside of us,
and so that's why I am so happy
that they've created a brand
that is going to provide
safer alternatives
for us to use that are
comfortable and high in quality.
Moving on to number two on the list,
let's talk about tampons and pantiliners.
They definitely go hand in hand because,
if you're gonna wear a tampon,
you should put a pantiliner
on because, I don't know,
you don't wanna ruin all your underwear
because you're gonna leak.
So my favorite tampons to
use are these ones by Rael.
They are also made of 100% organic cotton
and the applicator is
made out of cardboard,
which is what makes it biodegradable,
but it's not like the Whole Foods ones
where they're just so uncomfortable
and they chafe and scrape your vagina.
This is not the case at all.
These applicators have
a slight wax on them,
so when you put it in, it
just kinda slips right in
and it's very comfortable.
These are also the
pantiliners I love to use.
These are also by Rael.
And I love that this is very thin
and they are similar to the pads,
but just a lot more lightweight.
Personally, I like to wear tampons
when I am just gonna be in
and out of my clothes a lot,
like if I'm on a shoot or set.
Also, even if I'm on a
night out or something
and I'm wearing a body-con dress
or if I'm wearing anything
that just sticks to my legs.
I like to wear a tampon then.
But yes, I love this combo.
It is a must.
Let's move on to essential number three.
We're talking about underwear here.
I have ruined so many pairs
of underwear on my period,
and so I decided to just kind
of have specific underwar
that I wear when on my rag.
And I love these ones by Uniqlo.
This is there seamless hiphugger shorts.
And my girl Wei-Lee is the one
who showed me these panties
and they're incredible.
I bought a fresh pack for you
because I didn't want to
show you guys my old ones
so there you go.
This is definitely a bigger underwear
but I like big underwear
when I'm on my period.
I don't wanna wear a thong or
buttfloss when I'm on my rag.
I mean, it's just not comfortable.
I want a big, all encompassing
panty to just scoop me in.
These are incredibly comfortable.
They're super stretchy.
And I love that they're seamless
so that way you don't have
to see a visible panty line.
Essential number four is a
feminine hygiene wipe or wash.
I love these ones by Rael
because they are hypoallergenic.
They are biodegradable.
If you feel them, they kind of feel like,
like a substantial tissue.
You can rip them apart, but they're like,
they'll hold together on its own.
But they are this texture
because you can flush them.
That is an option.
Personally, I like to carry these wipes
when I'm just on the go
and I just want a refresher down there,
especially 'cause I'm a pad girl,
so I like using these wipes.
When you're on your period,
things just get gnarly.
There's blood, obviously.
There's some sweat and, you know,
there's just a lot of stuff down there
so I love using these wipes.
I know that some people are really against
feminine washes and wipes because they say
the vagina is self-cleansing
and it ruins your pH levels,
but personally, I've never
had a problem with it
disrupting anything down there.
I just like it clean, you know?
And I think, as long as you're not
getting the wash or the wipe
and you're getting inside your
vagina canal, you're okay.
I think the lips, the vulva,
the whatever you have
down there, that's all,
that's external, I think
that's all fair game.
During that time of the month,
my skin likes to flare up
and it's always the same area.
It's always around my chin.
I even have one right now
that's on its way out.
But when I get a pimple, I love to use
COSRX's acne pimple patches.
These are a godsend.
You basically just get a patch
and you pop it on your clean skin
and it'll just suck the gunk out.
It's incredible.
It works best after your pimple has popped
or when it's about to pop
because it (slurps) everything out.
And it just speeds up
the whole pimple process,
which I appreciate.
So my next few essentials
are those to remedy
the things that come
along with your period
like cramps, headaches, all that stuff.
But let's focus on cramps first.
Basically, when I'm on my second
or third day on my period,
it gets real crampy down
there and it's not fun.
It truly feels like my entire uterus
is falling out of my
vagina and it's not fun.
And so, when I have heavy cramps,
I love to use this heating pad.
I got this one off Amazon
and it's great to use.
You just plug it right in,
wrap that baby around the
areas that need warmth,
and for some reason, heat
really soothes the area.
You can even blast it on the back
because sometimes it hurts there too.
When cramps are bad,
I'll just throw this heating pad around me
and I'll put on a show and
just try to forget about it.
And by the end of my
show, I feel a lot better.
If the cramping just becomes unbearable
and I've got a headache,
I love to just use
these Advil Liquid Gels.
These are just your classic painkiller,
and they're just something
that you should just
have in your medicine
cabinet for everyone to use.
There will be a point in your life
when you're gonna need these.
Personally, I love the gels
because I feel like they just hit faster.
Maybe it's just a placebo effect,
but just seeing the gel
inside the pill and it
entering my body, I feel like
it's just releasing faster.
But yes, a medicine cabinet essential.
Moving on to essential number eight.
I love sipping on some ginger tea
on days where cramping
just gets out of hand.
Ginger is known to relieve
inflammation and pain
and, overall, it's just
really good for you.
If you have lemon, squeeze that in.
If you want some honey, squeeze that in.
It's all up to you, but
I love sipping on this
because it just makes me feel really cozy
and it just warms up that area as well.
I can't be the only one
that struggles with this,
but basically like a week
or so before my period,
I become very moody
and anything can make
me cry or make me mad.
It used to be a lot
worse when I was younger
and it's gotten a lot better now,
now that I'm older and I know myself.
I'm on birth control, so when I see
I'm on that week before my period,
I'm like, &quot;Okay, I'm
gonna be extra cautious
&quot;and extra aware of my behavior,&quot;
and I will always make sure
that I use Headspace for that week.
Headspace is a meditation
app that I've been using
for, I wanna say like a full year now.
I'm really proud of myself.
But basically, it's a meditation app
that has all these different
guides that you can do,
so when I am PMS-ey, I tend
to get a little more snappy,
so I'll throw in an
anger guided meditation
and I'll always make sure
that I do 20 minutes.
And I know 20 minutes can
seem like a long time.
I guess it is.
That's like a full show.
But I use that time to
really, really focus on myself
because they say that it takes you around
five to 10 minutes to even
get to the meditative state
so if you're gonna do it,
you might as well just
throw in that extra 10 minutes
and get your full, well-rounded 20.
And after, I feel so much better.
I feel more centered and a lot more aware,
and less things tick me off.
My last period essential is to exercise.
And I know that's like the
last thing you wanna hear,
but if I'm on my period and I literally
just do nothing the entire day,
I end up feeling a thousand times worse.
I'm not saying that
you gotta go to the gym
and do a full, high-intensity,
interval training workout for an hour.
That's not the case at all.
I think even walking maybe a mile outside,
going to go get a coffee,
or even parking further
than you normally would at a parking lot
just to get more steps
in, I think that's good.
It keeps your body moving.
It puts the circulation in motion.
And it just helps your body.
I mean, it's good to just get
exercise, get some endorphins.
Since I have been
exercising more regularly,
like I work out maybe four
to five times a week now,
but these days, my periods are
so much more breezy and easy.
All right guys, those were
all my period essentials.
I wanna thank Rael for
sponsoring this video again
because I absolutely love their brand
and what they stand for.
I can't wait for you guys to try it out.
I will leave all that information
in the description box
along with a discount code,
so definitely utilize that.
I would also love to know what your guys'
period essentials are or
what your period routine is.
Basically, anything to
make that time of the month
a little brighter.
I want to thank you guys
so much for watching
and I'll see you in the next one.
Bye!
Mwah!
