- Hi everyone!
It's your girl, Jenn, welcome back.
Today I have a really
fun styling video for you
because a lot of you guys were requesting
a more affordable outfits video.
So, I thought I would do
a really fun challenge
and create outfits that are around $25.
And, if I'm gonna be honest,
this was a little bit tricky.
But after scouring through
all the online sales,
applying every promo code, discount,
and also digging through
a ton of flea markets,
outlet stores and thrift stores,
I was able to create five trendy outfits
that won't break the bank.
So, I want to just dive into it right now,
so let's get started.
So this is look number one.
I wanted to begin with
something very casual.
This is a look that I would
rock if I were heading to class
or running out the door
to run some errands.
The statement piece in this
look is definitely the flannel.
I got this for one dollar at
the Goodwill Outlet Store,
and I love how thick and oversized it is.
It really makes for the
perfect layering piece.
Underneath, I'm rocking this
babydoll basketball tee.
I also got this for a
buck at the outlet store.
You might remember these
from my $1 try on haul,
I will leave that video in the cards
in case you haven't seen that.
But I thought that these two items
worked perfectly together.
My shorts are from the
Rose Bowl Flea Market
and I got these for $10
in one of those huge
denim short piles.
They're a great fit and I
love the distressed elements
on the edge.
Now for shoes, I
purchased a brand new pair
at Forever 21 for $12.45.
I got these as a BOGO deal,
so I bought one pair at full price
and so these ones came half off.
So my grand total for
this outfit comes out
to a whomping $24.45.
So we came super under budget.
I'm very pleased with myself.
I love this casual everyday outfit
and no one would know that
this was under 25 bucks.
All right, so let's move
onto look number two.
A super easy way to create
a budget friendly outfit
is to find an affordable dress.
I found this adorable
pink seersucker dress
at Forever 21 on sale for $10.
I love that the sleeves hug the arms
and I love how the dress
flares out at the bottom.
It's so summery, breezy, and
perfect for warm weather.
To accessorize I added some
pearl hoop earrings from H&amp;amp;M.
These were $7.99, so it ate
a little bit of my budget,
but I thought they were super cute
and I knew that they
tied the look together.
For shoes, I wore these white
kitten heels from Payless.
These were on sale for $12.99.
I also utilized the BOGO deal on there.
So my total for this
outfit comes out to $30.98.
And, I know, I'm over budget
on this one, like by $5.
But I think if I just
switched out the earrings
to something else, it
would have been under.
But, I don't know, please
just let this one slide
because this is the only
outfit that's over budget.
I thought this was super cute.
Something you could wear
to a brunch or even church.
So it's time for outfit number three.
I am definitely channeling
Sandy from Grease
with this outfit.
I think it looks super cute.
I've always loved over the shoulder tops.
And when I saw this bodysuit
on sale at Forever 21
for $8, I knew I had to
build an outfit around it.
For my jeans, I'm wearing
these American Apparel skinnies
that I got for $1 at the Goodwill Outlet.
These definitely have some
wear and tear in them,
but they're super comfy and helped
with this particular challenge.
For my shoes, I'm wearing
these crushed velvet mules
that were $8.49.
I was so happy they had my size left
because I am such a sucker
for shoes like this.
Then for earrings I wore
these gold hoops from H&amp;amp;M
to complete the look.
These were only $2.99.
My grand total for this
outfit comes out to $20.48.
So I am very under budget for this look
and it makes me really proud.
I know this outfit is a little
bit more on the basic side,
but it still packs a punch.
All right, so outfit
number four is perfect
for all those backyard
barbecues or picnics
you may be going to.
I'm wearing this striped
jumpsuit from Forever 21 for $10.
I love that it's strapless
so I'll be avoiding tan lines
and I'll just be keeping an
even complexion all around.
I don't lose my figure in this outfit
because it has an elastic
band that cinches the waist.
And it's in this comfy, breezy fabric
so I can eat all I want and relax.
I'm wearing the same shoes that I wore
in the previous outfit.
And I accessorized with this straw at
that I thrifted at Goodwill.
This was $3.99 and I think
it's just a complete staple
for the summer.
Lastly, for jewelry I'm wearing
these chain link earrings
from Forever 21, which I got for $2.95.
This entire look was $25.45.
So I'm just like a few cents over budget.
But hey, I think this outfit looks great.
This is a look that is
super chic and timeless.
So this is my last outfit.
And this one goes out to all
my California girls out there.
I think this just screams summer.
I love red.
It is my favorite bold color to rock.
I got this cute boxy jacket
from the Goodwill Outlet Store for $1.
I love that this is a structured piece
that adds a huge punch of color.
To coordinate, I added
this cute California tank
from Forever 21, this was $8.90,
and I am obsessed with the '70s cut.
For my pants, I'm wearing
the same dollar ones
from my previous outfit.
They just streamline the look
and the light wash works
perfectly with the vibrant colors.
Then, I finished off the look
with those white kitten
heels from Payless.
I would have loved to have
found a pair of white sneakers,
but unfortunately I couldn't
find anything online.
So I'll just have to scour more sales.
But, regardless, the grand
total for this outfit
comes out to $23.89.
So we made it under budget again.
Whoo!
All right guys, that is
a wrap on this video.
I hope you guys enjoyed this challenge
and I hope this inspired you to really dig
through all your online sales,
your local flea markets,
thrift stores, you can really
find a lot of amazing gems.
It doesn't have to be like a designer.
You can find something for a dollar
and make it look like a million bucks.
And if you guys would
like to try this challenge
out for yourself, please
show me your $25 outfit
on social media.
You can tag me at imjennim on
Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,
it's all the same.
And I would love to see
what your looks look like.
If you guys have any other
requests for styling videos,
please leave something in
the comments down below.
I want to thank you guys
so much for watching
and I'll see you guys in the next one.
Bye!
(kisses)
