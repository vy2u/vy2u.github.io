today's video is gonna be very very
casual I just picked out five of my
favorite looks this month
and most of these I wore to school so
they're very laid-back comfy and perfect
for college a lot of you guys refused to
know who fills my videos for me and it's
my housemate her name is Sol and she's
been filming for me for around six
months now she is astoundingly amazing
videographer and I'm really lucky to
live with her so yeah the mystery is
solved now so let's get on to the looks
I've been attracted to all things warm
and fuzzy since God knows one so it
makes perfectly clear sense that I would
be obsessed with mohair this cardigan is
really heavy-duty and best of all it's a
sick argyle pattern and I just feel like
a really super hip grandpa when I wear
it underneath I just wore a simple sheer
top and I went ahead and buttoned it all
the way to the top to give it a really
crisp and scholarly look and for my
bottoms I just found these old pair of
grey skinnies in my drawer and I thought
my pale pink kind of almost nude Mitzi
wedges would be perfect for this look
and I stopped in with my favorite nude
shades and top the entire look with
these tortoise framed cat eye sunglasses
I think a casual outfit is all about
adding texture and dimension to your
look and for this case I grab my pumpkin
orange shaggy cardigan and I
strategically rolled up the sleeves to
give it more shape since it's so
oversized and on my top I'm wearing this
really funny spin-off of the classic old
show beavis and butthead but instead of
being boring inferior humans they're
freaking aliens which makes it ten times
more amazing and for my bottoms I'm just
wearing my trusty indigo skinnies and
absolutely no casual outfit would be
right if I didn't have on my creepers
there on my feet a minimum of four times
a week because they're mad comfy and
easy to slip in and out of added some
decorative socks to jazz it up a bit and
I went for a pinky nude lip
I think it's safe to say that we've all
had those days where nothing seems to be
going right well I've christened this
jacket to wear during those days
definitely a tongue-in-cheek graphic
which I find to be humorous it's really
exaggerated and a hyperbole and a funny
statement to wear on those off days
underneath I'm wearing my same sheer top
you saw my first look and I added this
beautiful rich and patterned tapestry
scarf I can't believe it's from forever
21 because it feels really expensive
stepping down to my bottoms I popped on
my brown almost wool like skater skirt
and moving even more self I slipped on
to one of my casual boots the strap of
the shoe create a subtle cutout and a
fat chunky nineties heel makes it fun to
stop runnin I added some warmth own
accessories and I fish off the look with
the same lip color from before
Breaking Bad is one of my favorite shows
and as we're all eagerly waiting for the
last portion of season we can wait by
wearing this insane spiral graphic
filled top with Walter White or if you
want to call him by street name
Heisenberg over the color top I chucked
on this shaumbra anorak chambre is a
relatively thin material so it's gonna
transition so well for the spring I
thought I would keep the cool toned
aspect of my outfit by wearing these
navy-blue velvet leggings and to go
all-out on crazy I busted out my chic
Rea platforms some of you guys may be
cringing at these but I love them
fashion isn't about pleasing other
people it's about wearing what you like
and feeling really good in it this is my
last outfit and I'm going to end it with
sportswear it's something that I've been
really warming up to I just really like
the way it looks when it's kind of
paired with something that's not very
sporty at all in my case I decided to
wear my intense thick sweater that's
adorned with these triangles I think
it's just a really fun and casual print
which is just right up my alley
for my pants I'm wearing my light
acid-wash another they're practically
white skinnies and I thought that they
would really meld super well with my
outfit and for my shoes I went along and
paired it with my basic lace-up boots
that go with everything
I would love it if you guys would
comment down below and let me know which
ones you read outfit if you don't want
to comment that that's cool just let me
know what your plans are this weekend or
something that's really exciting that's
happening - I would love to read it and
I want to get to know you guys a little
bit better and realistically I don't
think I'm going to film the hair curling
tutorial video by this month because the
month is pretty much over this is the
curling iron I use it is by Conair it
says you crawl on it also for you guys
but it's gonna happen
in February because midterms are kicking
my butt right now there next week and
I'm kind of freaking out because I have
midterms and I have essays due and I
want to film these videos because I find
it very therapeutic but I kind of to
balance things out because I'm also a
student you have an Instagram my
username is I'm genom you can follow me
if you wanna talk to you guys in the
next video and take care bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
