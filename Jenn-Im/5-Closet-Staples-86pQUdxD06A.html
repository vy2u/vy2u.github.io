I'd talk about my five closet stables
because it's a question that comes up
fairly often and honestly took me a long
time to whittle it down only to five
because I wanted to keep it at the bare
minimum and I also wanted to go really
in depth with each article of clothing
first item is a white top there's
nothing easier to style than a crisp
white blouse and I wanted to show you
guys how versatile they can be by
selling it in three ways one of the most
iconic ways to style it is with a pair
of blue denim for this outfit I wore
some true blue skinnies and I felt like
this was a versatile look that I can
wear to school or even on a date my
second look with a white top has more of
a conservative feel I paired the blouse
with a nice black miniskirt which i
think is such a tasteful and timeless
piece I wore my black strappy platform
shoes to make it more youthful and I
also didn't want to look like mrs.
Doubtfire so I had to make it a little
bit more modern my last look featuring
white top is by far the most daring
option when you pair white with white
you get an instant chic outfit this is
something I'd wear to an industry event
or I just want to stand out and make a
statement
moving on to cause a staple number two I
have the classic black pair of skinnies
one of the most effortless ways to rock
black skinnies is just with a white tank
and a denim button-down this is another
Bristol outfit that gives off a very
relaxed and a California cool vibe next
up on the list we've got the LBD aka the
little black dress I swear this is
something that every girl needs my
favorite one I have is this black
strappy little number and the best part
of this dress is the sexy double strap
feature on the shoulder I also love
little black dresses that are off the
shoulder this dress is totally for a
formal event when you want to dress to
impress and I decided to add a little
gold choker to the look to bring the
dress to life my last LBD option is
perfect for a summer day I absolutely
love the halter strap because it gives
more of an athletic and casual vibe I
think that's what sets it apart from the
other dresses coming up at number four
is the pattern top to be honest it was a
tie between a striped top and a floral
top but I just was floral because it's
spring and I thought it'd be a good
opportunity to put some color in this
video
and so my first option is this really
cute blue floral table if you're a
little bit uneasy and uncomfortable
wearing a pattern top then going with
something that has a tiny floral print
is something that's going to ease you
into wearing a bold pattern my second
flow option is a cute floral tunic this
print is a little bit more bold it was a
little too short to wear the dress so I
added my ripped biker shorts that i
shredded myself and I think this adds a
little more rock and roll to the sweet
pattern my last flow option is this
black and white tank the print on this
is massive and just screams flowerpower
I decided to pair the top with some
baggy paper bag denim shorts and then I
actually wore flats
so my last wardrobe essential is nude
undergarments a lot of people ask me
what I wear under sheer things or off
the shoulder pieces and that's just a
nude bra and just something that's flush
colored and matches your skin tone
you're good to go
my favorite bra to wear is this one by
Victoria's Secret it's great because
it's really close to my skin tone and
the straps of the option to come off so
it's been amazing to pair with off the
shoulder pieces and white tops also you
don't need to spend a ton of money on a
nude bra just go into target or a
forever 21 even and they have bras for
around 10 to 13 dollars so you can
easily get one there so those are my 5
closet staples feel free to comment down
your closet essentials in the comments
box I would love to read about them and
maybe I would consider them in to my
part too anyway by the time I release
this I'll be in Singapore I'll be there
for a conference and I'm gonna try and
vlog it for you I'm going to edit my
Coachella vlog on the plane while I'm
there so hopefully that will be up by
then basically I have a lot of work to
do and I hope you guys have a beautiful
day
and I'll see you guys in my next video
