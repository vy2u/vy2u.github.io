first day of February today it's going
to be a really busy day I'm heading out
to the OC because I'm about to film a
very highly requested video for you guys
my friends boo and Teresa are helping me
film it so it's going to be it's going
to be good I hope
alright so we are at headquarters and we
are pretty much setting up the backdrop
for the sunglasses video and these are
the sunglasses that I am featuring I
just picked out my favorite of the
favorites
bang bang
so we're back home now I feel like the
shoot I'm super well I'm so excited to
start editing this video it's gonna be
insane
I didn't get to work out in the morning
so we're gonna squeeze a workout in in
the afternoon Wow the thought of working
out it just sounds horrible but you
gotta do what you gotta do
I finished my workout I just ran a
couple miles and then I just half-ass
some strength training I don't I just
can't really work out an afternoon yeah
we're gonna make salmon for dinner with
some miracle noodles
mmm Wow
look out Ben portions the meals we get
this this is massive this is nothing but
goodness this way you get love it's
rapture what have your play is how
decorative hi guys happy Tuesday I
already had breakfast just had a little
egg wrap and now I'm gonna get ready for
my yoga lesson and it pains me to say
this because I I really don't like yoga
like what I workout I want to be
sweating heart racing I want all of that
and with yoga I've never really had that
experience I know you're working out
different muscles and it's like a
different form of working out but the
thing is in 2016 I want to be able to
become more flexible by the fact that I
can't even touch my toes just bothers me
and I want to become more flexible I
feel like it's just good for the muscles
etc etc so come with me to my first
class the yoga session with Diana went
awesome it was definitely challenging in
its own way like just holding the
positions and all that stuff
stretching it's a different kind of pain
but I'm happy that I did it I feel a lot
more relaxed and calm
we found this like playlist on Spotify
just called yoga and I just kind of want
to have it playing all the time it just
really sets you in to like a nice
peaceful and mindful zone but anyway I
finished getting ready and I got a call
from my dad it was
hey I'm downstairs do you want a coffee
my dad works around the neighborhood so
he just stopped by and got me a nice
coffee it's gone now but it was just
nice seeing him and I'm so lucky to have
a parent like my dad he's great I am
eating lunch now I'm eating some cutted
ice on brown rice and I have a generous
portion of kimchi because I freaking
love this combination it tastes so good
and it's just really nostalgic I see
this a lot when I was a kid and in
college because it's super easy to make
we just found the greatest parking spot
of all time right opening the elevator
y'all done better first up is Nike that
is returning these shoes because they're
too small
isn't that right yeah a little pain loss
me
people it's too small so our fingers
cross I'm going to have a better size
they didn't have the size they wanted in
black so he's going to get the white
ones as displayed on this lovely model
they're morning guys
so I am on my way to go to my favorite
workout class which is called speed play
it is a class of high-intensity interval
training so basically you sweat a lot
and you're sore for the next few days it
always keeps my ass so I'm heading over
there right now I'm already out of
breath and speed walking but yeah don't
know if I can film in there because you
know people don't like being filmed and
while they're working out so yeah I'll
just try and get as many clips as I can
all right
oh I shouldn't have had shepherd's pie
and hot sauce for breakfast
look the ideal pre-workout breakfast but
what can you do I'm just going to shower
off and then I'm going to film my
January favorites wow sounds crazy and
then Stephanie and I are gonna get our
nails done because my nails are pretty
disgusting right now out here with stuff
got some red nails for Chinese New Year
are you excited for the party yeah it's
gonna be great spring your separate ways
now right yeah I'm here with Ben hi guys
we are heading to the well right now
picking out some stuff for a shoot that
I have on Friday you're so tall I can't
get you
we are walking to the wall which is one
of my favorite fashion boutiques in
cosmos ten hundred advise for girls and
boy yeah I like to store a lot and our
friend the leases are gonna look after
us man he's going to be there great
photographer so it's gonna be good we're
not all the wrong clothes were fitting
I'm wearing a black bra and I'm wearing
big underwear just to you life so I
don't know I didn't think this through
so we are here at the well one of my
favorite places I get so much
inspiration over here I just love like
all the interesting stuff they have
especially the Hat like I don't know if
I'm bold enough to wear this but I mean
the option is there you know look at
this way this is pretty much like the
Sorting Hat I probably a Hufflepuff me
and Matt are both kind of go for like an
editorial theme so it should be cool
we're gonna shoot it out in Malibu it's
going to be off them got a lot of stuff
to do today particularly just editing
and uploading my January favorites video
by the time you are watching this video
perhaps you've already seen my January
favorites I also really need to clean
the house it's just in oh hey Ben oh so
today is not going to be too exciting
just a warning
you
Ben and I are at number
Tyrael
is in arts district we discovered this
place by our friend Justin Wilbert me
works here all the time so
without me drop in and got some lunch
coming our way we got a salad and we've
got some sort of Bimini it's not very
nice vibe here the outside it's nice
several other five places which you
don't need is where today we have very
excited nice cold brew to wake up for
the day I have been home for the past
two hours figuring out what the hell is
wrong with my Final Cut Pro because it
suddenly just started crashing and
freezing and I wasn't able to edit and
so I called the Genius Bar and they
basically just told me like to delete
the entire app so or the program and so
I'm just starting from scratch pretty
much so everything that I worked on is
gone the good thing is I still have the
clips for my January favourites so I'm
just basically you know starting over
it's pretty frustrating and I'm not in
the best mood but whatever happens it is
9:30 p.m. and there is a happy ending
for today I'm done with it
so now it is uploading onto YouTube
there's only one minute remaining so I
am a happy camper
I may be in celebrating with some wine
so you know it's a good night morning

going to Malibu or technically we're in
Malibu I'm with Ben and Matt we're doing

sick
hey oh we're home now we've been home
for a while after we dropped off Matt we
went to Mendocino farms and had lunch I
got like the sandwich
of study study of heat sandwich
something like that but for some reason
it came in a tortilla even though I
asked for a pressed panini and I still
ate it and was good I just was not
expecting or tortilla I'm just like the
type of person that if a server or
someone gets my order wrong I'll still
eat it I'll just feel like okay this is
what I'm eating now anyway today is
Friday and I used up like the last pair
of eyelashes I have so I feel like I
should go out tonight even though I just
want to stay and watch Walking Dead and
I want to show you guys these cute
little plants look at them they are the
self watering plants and we got them for
Christmas from Stephanie so this is a
little parsley plant this is basil and
this is mint how cute are these I like
how they're all like bending towards the
Sun they're like ah Sun I don't know how
true it is but they say that talking to
your plants is good because it gives it
carbon dioxide so hey guys what's up how
