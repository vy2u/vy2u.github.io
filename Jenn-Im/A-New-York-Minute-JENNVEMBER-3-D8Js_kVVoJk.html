second episode of Jenin burr today I'm
just getting a lot of work done I have a
huge panel tomorrow so I'm going to
basically answer the questions
beforehand so when I own the panel I'm
not you know my brain doesn't shut off
hopefully so that's what I'm going to do
and then I gotta get my nails done
because these are getting a little too
long it's getting hard to take my
contacts out so it's time for a change
all right we're at the nail box la this
is a really cute nail salons in the arts
district look at that aesthetic though
you I was Sophia Whaley Hey ladies
alright but for some rosy tones today
yeah we just know that I'm adding kind
of sheep do we make Star Cafe Gratitude
of course got an Asian salad here
consumer tastes like she's got a curry
bowl Sophie I got a rap good morning
Here I am a my usual spot to reach you
bed and actually came from New York last
night at midnight he was so shattered
though because usually from New York to
LA only takes five hours but because he
took some connecting flights
it took him a total of 12 hours so he
was so exhausted and now he left at 7:00
a.m. to go to work today I'm actually
speaking at a conference called wwg
digital forum and I'm a little nervous
but I have all the questions beforehand
so last night I was with Ashley and we
just kind of you know brainstormed on
what I would say so that way when I'm on
stage I'm not bricks and my
brain doesn't fart so right now I am
just really fine-tuning my answers and I
think I feel pretty good about it
because it's basically just me
explaining what is happening with the
social media space from a creators point
of view um so yeah I should probably get
lunch or make lunch
should I make lunch I should make lunch
I'll make chicken soup right now in
front of the Hammer Museum about to head
to the panel so you've got Instagram but
it's a story about snapchat Facebook
like all this stuff so it's really not
just prioritizing what platform you find
is best for you so for me YouTube always
comes
what is this bread pudding Alamo white
chocolate bread pudding with vanilla
bean my school for I am going to LAX to
go to New York I don't condone it high

were just like oh yeah I'm so sorry but
my my drunken mess still was able to
take off all my makeup and put my
moisturizers in skincare so autopilot
Jen you done good
but anyway last night with ad council
was amazing it was such an inspiring
event for those who don't know what ad
council is it's an organization that's
nonprofit that gathers a bunch of brands
and connects them with creators to make
public service announcements for the
people so they're the ones who created
Smokey Bear they're the ones who created
the crash-test dummy for seatbelt safety
they do anti-bullying campaigns and I'm
so honored to be one of their creators
for good for Goodwill and I feel like
it's a really great fit especially
because I've been shopping at Goodwill
since God knows when so it's just a
really good match and I'm really excited
to show you guys my goodwill video that
