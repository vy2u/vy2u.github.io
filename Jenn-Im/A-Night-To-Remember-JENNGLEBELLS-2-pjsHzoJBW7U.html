just pounded out the work I uploaded my
holiday gift guide so if you want to
watch that feel free to click on the
little I that's the card feature on
YouTube and then you'll see the video
there Ben and I went to the orthopedic
doctor and they did some x-rays and then
they put like an actual cast on him the
doctor said that we're gonna wait a week
see how it's healing and then do some
more x-rays to see if he needs a CT scan
and then from there we're gonna see if
you need surgery but right now
everything is just up in the air but the
doctor didn't seem too worried so that
makes me feel better about the whole
entire thing she said this is a really
common break that happens to a lot of
snowboarders so let's just hope Ben has
a quick and swift recovery dog saving
mochi right now and it's good because it
keeps chickie running around so yeah I'm
just gonna finish up my treatment for my
November favorites and then work on my
goodwill video I guess Paco chooses Oh

denim jacket.look book I'm super excited
these are the jackets I will be making
outfits for I know it looks like a mess
right now but I swear I have a system
well honestly it's going to be a little
tricky to film now that Ben has his
wrist broken it sucks because he broke
his right hand so he can't even press
like the button so we're gonna get
creative we're gonna set up some tripods
and see how everything pans out yeah

vlogging today because I just wanted to
smash everything out November favorites

started editing and I finished it and
then we smashed out an outfit for my
Levi's lookbook yeah we're getting throw
up slowly but surely yeah thanks to the
tripod yes the tripod really helps how's
your arm boom as you can see it broken
the old rest I mean have you told the
guys oh yeah I've told them in like a
couple clips
yeah I mean it's almost been a week now
so feeling a lot better obviously the
pain still there but get through it
about about the day I think is still
just about film which is important

eight weeks I want to still manage to
make sure I can do stuff so yeah today

around it was quite something he'll
always want to look back on so we're
getting a photo frame that we took all
together at the slopes and we're going
to get a friend and then give it to him
tonight which would be I think he's
going to like it here we are at Aaron
Brothers that is confirming with the
person printing out the actual photo to
see what kind of frame we need to get
I've been here a little commotion back
there because you have the group from

multitask and moisturize and do an intro
at the same time I'm in a little bit of
a rush today because I'm about to head
on over to the revolve social house to
do a live makeup tutorial
I've already got my foundation and brows
on and I'm going to be using all the
beauty products they saw on the website
now and it's like an amazing curated
list and so I'm going to do my eyeshadow
they're my contour highlighter all the
rest of my makeup when I'm there so
that's why I'm all dolled up right now
I'm like really out of breath because I
feel like I've just been running around
the house doing things live always makes
me a little you know nervous but I'm
just gonna pretend like I'm on Facebook
live or something and just kind of be in
that mindset all right so let's go
pretty much my little stage in here and
this is gonna project onto it these
dreams this cow

going to do a little swoop like that and
see how pigmented
Mahlon okay guys I'm back at home I had
so much fun doing the revolve live maker
tutorial honestly I was a little nervous

little bit when I was applying the
eyeshadow but other than that it went
pretty smoothly I think I did a drop
ball and I didn't freeze so that's good

last outfit for my Levi's lookbook video
