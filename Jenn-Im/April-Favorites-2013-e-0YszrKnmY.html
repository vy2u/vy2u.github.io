April favorites and I missed March
favorites so this favorites video is
going to be a fusion between March and
April so let's start molding Sally
Hansen's specific blue because this mail
color has been on my nails
hardcore all of April if you look back
at any of my videos in April you'll see
Pacific food making a little cameo and I
think I was really drawn to this polish
because it clashed with everything but
in a really good way it if anything it
was really unexpected it's kind of a
tribute to April showers even though it
hasn't really rained that much last
month but it's just cute to be themed I
guess I used to be a big fan of crest
until I swore it off in February I was
using crest ProHealth
and it was making me develop this
strange white foam around my mouth
probably 20 to 30 minutes after brushing
and it would be literally the skin on my
mouth just dissolving so I switched to
Colgate and I am really loving this
stuff and the formula of this toothpaste
really lingers in your mouth so your
mouth feels minty for longer amounts of
time and as for the whitening components
of it I can't really claim that it's
made my teeth whiter because they've
been pretty much consistent so perhaps
it's been maintaining the color of my
teeth my third favorite is a canteen I
used to have a purple canteen until I
had to retire it my calf just wasn't
very sturdy so into the student store
and I splurged on this army green
canteen it's by Under Armour and it was
$25 which is the most I've ever invested
on a canteen but I'm drinking why don't
have servings of this bottle a day so I
think that's pretty good for my system
it's got this awesome Popoff cap and it
has a nozzle and I've come to realize
that I really like things with Knowles's
because it makes me drink more and
lastly it has this nice metal strap that
just ensures the fact that this cap will
never flip off like my Purple Line my
next favorite are fluoro head crowns
these two are from Urban Outfitters and
the reason I got two is because I just
couldn't decide
one I chose the red crown because I
wanted this to coordinate with outfits
that were warmer in color and I picked
up the white crown to go with pretty
much everything else because white goes
with everything so earlier in April I
was opening up a soy sauce packet really
excitedly and it just sprayed all over
my shirt and in a frenzy I rushed him to
the student store because I knew had to
find something with bleach because I
didn't want the stains set and luckily
they had tied to go and I wanted to give
a little shot to this because it saved
my shirt within seconds this pen just
obliterated that stain so now this thing
comes with me everywhere and is the new
addition to my purse next favorite is
the film and it is a 90s movie called
Total Recall and it features Arnold
Schwarzenegger and I didn't expect to
like it because it it's a sci-fi action
film and it's not the sci-fi that
deterred me it was action and I'm
typically not drawn to action films
unless there's a really interesting plot
and Total Recall has it so here's the
basic summary of it it takes place in
the future and Mars is a colony of Earth
and unfortunately Mars isn't very well
kept it's run by this really corrupt
institution and all the marginalized and
socially disenfranchised people are
inhabiting Mars now and so things are
just getting worse and worse
so this higher power is starting to make
air really expensive and it's starting
to deform the people in Mars and causing
mutations and some and some kids are
getting psychic powers but overall
things are getting terrible so this is
where Allen comes in and just tear
up and I'm just gonna leave it at that
please watch it it comes off a little
bit cheesy and dated but I promise you
that it's a very thought-provoking
socially politically relevant and
something that will leave you kind of
wondering especially that ending that
will leave you wondering my last
favorite is an interview that I did
design Cal's in April I did an interview
with dread sense for their blogger hot
minute and I'm gonna link that video in
this video or if it's not working here
then please check the description box
because I'll put a direct link there and
I'm just answering a bunch of questions
and you guys can get to know me a little
bit better and it's just some fun b-roll
there too so please feel free to check
it out
and those are all my favorites I hope
you guys enjoyed them please comment
down below if any of these things
interest you or just struck a nerve in
you or something I would love to hear
about it if you have an Instagram my
username is I'm Dunham and also I am
proud to present my new middle part I've
been growing out my bangs since October
and now they're finally long enough for
me to frame them into a middle part it
took forever let me know what you guys
think because I think it's a pretty big
change for me I know it's just one
parting but I feel like it frames my
face really differently I will see you
guys in the next video
