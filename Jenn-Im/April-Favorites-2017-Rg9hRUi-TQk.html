favorite three today on sleep I'm a
little stressed out on how quickly this
year is going by we're literally plowing
through 2017 and it's true the saying
that the older you get the faster the
year seems to go that's definitely my
life but anyway on a lighter note I've
got some my favorite things from April
and if you're a lover of favorite videos
make sure you subscribe to my channel
the button is down below so hit that and
subscribe I provide a monthly favorite
every single month so you'll always have
something to look forward to so with
that said let's get started in April I
fell in love with this strappy nude
wedge they're probably similar to you
because I've been plastering them all
over my Instagram my youtube channel
these have just been on my feet non-stop
because they just go with everything and
they're super comfortable because it is
a wedge it's very rare for me to wear
shoes that don't have a platform or a
wedge because this is just painful I
think it's about time that I retire my
new shoe nude platforms that I used to
wear all the time for years I think
we've got a new nude shoe in town a
common question that I get pretty often
is what kind of bra I wear with items
that are strapless or backless and
before my answer was always oh I wear a
sticky bra but I just never really
recommended it that much because my
sticky bra all kind of sucked it was
always just okay like if it was really
hot or four about sweaty the sticky bra
would just kind of fall off and it was
just it just felt horrendous wearing
that when it was hot but in April I
discovered these nipple covers these are
silicone nipple covers and look they're
pretty large which is nice actually
because you would think in theory that
smaller different nipple covers will be
better but larger ones are in fact
better because they provide shape to
your breasts and it just covers the
entire thing which is nice so these are
great for items that are backless
strapless and even if you have some
things up with a plunging neckline
these are godsend
I just make sure that every time I use
them I put them in this case because I
don't want to lose these guys and I make
sure to keep this little plastic wrap
just to keep it nice and secure it keeps
the heat Civ quite tacky and you could
just wear them over and over now that
I've discovered these I've just been
wearing a lot more backless items and I
just love these guys these are necessity
in every girl's wardrobe
moving on to some beauty products that
I've been loving here I have Co parries
coconut body glow and I actually
discovered this in my hotel room
well that's my chela and I went ham with
this product every single day when I was
out there basically I'd put several
pumps of this on my hand until my whole
body was slaughtered with this my legs
and my arms just any piece of flesh that
was showing it for my face yeah I would
put this on and would give my body just
a beautiful golden shimmer and it's got
like little tiny gold flecks in it and
it just I don't know it just makes your
skin look so glowy and bronzed I feel
like it definitely has some sort of
toning effect and I can see myself
rocking this for any summer future event
like like I don't know a fourth of July
pool party or just another Music
Festival another beauty product that
I've been loving has been this
highlighting palette by Stila this is
their star light star bright palette and
I feel like I've mentioned this in
multiple videos by now but I had to put
on my favorites because I was literally
wearing this highlighter right in the
middle kitten throughout the entire
month of April all of these highlighters
are gorgeous but the one in the middle
kitten is just out of control I really
love the formula of this because it's
not a powder but it's not a cream either
it just kind of dances in between the
middle and I think it gives a perfect
dewy natural finish this palette is also
part of my Jet Set gen box and this is
probably one of my favorite pieces in
the entire set next up I've got this lip
butter by Sol de Janeiro this is their
Brazilian kiss cupola lip butter and if
I'm going to be completely real the
reason why I love this like 60% reason
why loves is because of the scent it
smells so darn scrumptious it smells
like vanilla bean and it's I don't know
if you don't like vanilla scent you're
not
like this but if you do you're going to
be obsessed with this
I'm enjoy putting this on my list it's
like an experience that I want to have
because it smells so delicious maybe
that's part of their marketing strategy
you just make it smell really good so
people just use it up faster my last
favorite is a podcast that I've been
listening to non-stop it's called how I
built this and it's by NPR and this is a
podcast where they just get a bunch of
entrepreneurs innovators idealists and
they come on the show to talk about how
they were able to build their empire or
their movements and it's just so
inspiring to listen to because as a
yellow entrepreneur it's always good to
have some sort of mentor like I
personally don't have one but that's why
I always seek out information like this
and one of my favorite stories was by
the guy who created 5-hour energy I know
super random it's that little tiny
bottle that you see in all corner stores
in America
he now has like a billion dollar
industry and his story was so
interesting at the end the host asked
him what are three tips that every
entrepreneur should follow in order to
have a successful business and the first
one was common sense use your common
sense make things as simple as possible
don't waste your time using jargon and
making things sound complex to make a
sound to make yourself sound smarter
that is going to do the opposite so go
what you got use your common sense tip
number two was to be determined you know
everyone can be passionate but after
you've been kicked in the face a couple
of times passion fades but determination
means that no matter what you are
getting up and you're starting again
because you've got that mentality the
last piece of advice was as having a
sense of urgency that means do it now
not later not tomorrow do it now
because when you put things off you know
you tend to forget about it so always
have a sense of urgency do it now
I've just been really enjoying listening
to this while I'm walking to the gym
it's like a 15 20 minute walk so these
podcasts are just perfect pieces of
information while I'm walking alright
guys so that wraps up my April favorites
I am so sorry that there's no Solon
favorite or a book favorite I just
didn't read anything
and I didn't watch anything but if you
want to write down any of the
recommendations from film to books to
podcast especially put it down in the
comments down below I would love to read
about it I generally love reading what
you guys have to say I do have a very
long list of current recommendations but
I am always open to add more to that but
anyway if you guys enjoyed the video
make sure you hit the like button
subscribe to my channel if you haven't
already and I'll see you guys in the
next one
