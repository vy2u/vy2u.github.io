- Hey everyone, it's your
girl Jenn, and welcome back.
Today I have all my
favorites in a row for ya'll,
it is that time of the month and I've got
quite a number of things to share.
I feel like April was really
jam-packed more than usual
because there was a
lot of travel involved.
Music festival season started,
I went to my first bachelorette ever,
we went to Cabo and it was
my first time in Mexico
and it was just so beautiful,
I can't wait to share
that vlog with ya'll,
but yeah, lots of things
have happened and I ended up
accumulating a lot of things
that I loved in April,
so let's get crackin.
So first up I've got these
crystal hoop earrings,
these are from Style Nanda,
I feel like it's just kinda
like a fun twist on that
traditional hoop earring look.
It's like a hoop with a hoop
with a hoop and it's got
crystals on it, there's a lot going on,
but I feel like it just
adds an element of elegance
to my outfit.
So my next pair of earrings
are by a brand called Laruicci,
I think I'm butchering that name,
but I love that these are
such a huge statement.
I rocked them on day 3 of Coachella and
I got so many compliments on them.
I think it's because they're
just very in your face,
and I must admit, they are heavy.
Like you can really feel
something tugging at your ears,
but I didn't care, I just
loved the way they look,
and I love the fact
that they are excessive,
gaudy, decadent, I have just
always loved that element
that some earrings can bring and
these definitely tick all those boxes.
So now I'm gonna move to a book favorite,
if you guys are familiar with my channel,
then you guys know that
I love Audible and I am
so happy that they are partnering
with me again this month.
For those who don't know what Audible is,
it is a service that has
unmatched selection of
audio books, podcasts, news, broadcasting,
just anything in that space, they've got.
And one audio book that
I finished is called the
&quot;Mastery of Love&quot; by Don Miguel Ruiz.
I've mentioned his book,
&quot;The Four Agreements&quot;
in a previous favorites and
that book was so transformative,
and so I just wanted to
get deeper in the hole.
I wanted to listen to this
book because I wanted to know
his philosophies on love and
how you can be truly happy.
They biggest lesson that I
learned from this audio book
is that I am responsible
for my own happiness.
When you start to depend on
other people for your sole
happiness you will get disappointed
because everyone's human
but if you truly truly love
yourself and you know how to
make yourself happy, then
it just kinda overflows out,
and anything else that you
experience is just a bonus.
I can't believe that I'm
getting married this summer,
and this book taught me that
relationship comes in halves,
and I am only responsible
for my fifty percent.
As long as I'm doing my best
and giving it my all for my
portion of the half, that's
all I need to worry about,
because when you start
trying to control someone
else's half, it just gets
toxic because it is their half
to take control of.
If you guys are interested
in trying an audio book for
yourself please use my link, it is,
audible.com/clothes,
they have just like a huge
selection of everything and now
that it is summertime I feel
like audio books or podcasts,
they really go hand in hand
because as long as you are doing
something with your hands you can still
keep your mind stimulated
and that's really fun.
You can use my link, again it is,
audible dot com slash C L O T H E S.
For U.S. viewers you can
text clothes to 500-500,
lots of options that
you can do to subscribe,
you will get a free audio book
and a thirty day membership.
They have so many genres from
sci-fi, romance, non-fiction,
the list goes on, it's all there.
So I got a lot of sun in April,
we had Coachella, we
had Cabo, now Singapore,
and I always remember to use sunscreen,
it's so so important to protect your body,
and this one by Supergoop has
been my absolute favorite.
It made an appearance
in my Coachella vlog,
if you haven't seen that
I'll put it in the card,
so please go watch it.
I love Supergoop because
they really like to
switch the way you put sunscreen on.
One comes in a foam,
there's like this cool
sunscreen primer for your face,
so I appreciate that they are
making putting on sunscreen interesting.
So with this one you just spritz it on and
you just rub it in and apparently
this is also supposed to
give you like a nice bronzey glow,
but I cannot claim that
it did that for me.
It's really hard for me to tell
like whether I got tan from
using this or from just like
being blasted by the sun.
I think it's just a combination of both,
but regardless, this is
absolutely a summer essential, and
I will continue to use this
as the sun continues to stay.
Another body product that
I have been loving has been
Fenty Beauty's Body Lava.
Now, this is one of the most
hyped up items on social media,
but girl, I have been loving
to use this at Coachella,
it was incredible.
So with this a little bit goes a long way,
like I'll just need one
pump to cover my entire arm,
and like half my decollete
and I just love how sparkly it is,
like I love glitter and so
that's why I was living for this,
and when the sun shines on
it like you are just like a
glittering disco ball
and I loved it so much,
I feel like one of the biggest
issues were that people were
saying that this feels quite sticky,
but honestly after twenty
minutes of putting it on like,
it feels fine and I feel
like the reason why it
has to be sticky is because
that's how like all the glitter
particles stay on because if
it didn't have that stickiness
I feel like it would just flake off,
but these glitters are
really here to stay,
and they make your body look
so sparkly and toned and I
can't wait to use this one more.
So one TV show that Ben
and I just got completely
sucked into is Peaky Blinders,
and I know we are so late
in the game with this but girl,
this show is so addicting
if you are into like,
dramas and beautiful
cinematic story telling,
I highly recommend this.
It's about like a gangster
family in Birmingham and it's
lead by Thomas Shelby and Thomas Shelby,
Ben and I have both agreed,
is just one beautiful specimen
and if you guys watch this
show then you will know
what I am talking about,
it's beyond like just the way he looks,
it's like the way he carries himself,
how he internalizes everything,
and he's just like a man's man.
The fashion is also sick, if
I were a dude I would dress
like a Peaky Blinder all the time.
Ben loves the fashion so much
that he's even having his
wedding suit designed like
Thomas Shelby so yeah,
it's a little sneak peak of that,
there are, I think there's like 5 seasons,
so we've still got two
seasons to dive into,
so please catch up with us and
let me know what you think.
So my last favorite is this
protein powder by Vega.
This is plant based and I have
been loving to use this in my
smoothie every morning after I work out.
This has twenty grams of protein
and 2 servings of greens,
and it makes my smoothies taste so bomb,
I have shown this in a vlog for you,
but my smoothies are pretty simple,
I just have almond milk,
two fistfuls of spinach,
a scoop of this and one
banana and some ice,
and it's just my favorite
breakfast to eat and I will put it
in a future vlog for y'all
because I don't think I
could make an entire separate
video on this smoothie, but
yeah, I will put it in a vlog,
and you guys can see me drink it.
Alright guys, those were
all my favorites this month
and you know the drill,
please tell me your
favorites in the comments down below,
I truly love reading what
you guys have to say,
and it just makes me feel
more connected to you guys,
it is definitely my favorite
part of doing YouTube,
is reading what you guys have to say
and interacting with you guys.
I want to thank you guys
so much for watching
and I'll see you guys
in the next one! Bye!
