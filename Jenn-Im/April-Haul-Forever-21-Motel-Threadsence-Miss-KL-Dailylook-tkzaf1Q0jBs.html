haul for you guys so I'm gonna just try
to machine-gun through them we're gonna
start with items from forever 21 my
heart drops when anything has a very
intricate color so when I saw this
lovely little number hanging at forever
21 I had a snack it it's quite lolita
with this baby bib collar and I like how
it's black I know it doesn't really
necessarily agree with the hot heat but
luckily it's sleeveless so it's gonna
work the next item is this a line flare
skirt I think a line skirts are
flattering for all body types because it
hugs you at the smallest part of your
waist and just Jets out into this
beautiful flare so it just hides the
thighs so you have some mystery with it
I saw this chunky houndstooth cardigan
and I thought it would just be a perfect
addition to add to my houndstooth
collection so far I have a blazer I have
a dress and now I have a cardigan so I
think it's pretty complete I got this
cardigan for ten dollars and it has a
really nice vintage feel to it because
of the buttons they kind of sag but I
think it gives it a lot of character
this graphic tee combines two of my
favorite things which are game Yang's
and floral patterns oh maybe if I wear
this I'll find some balance in the great
outdoors this is just a really nice
graphic tee to pair with some great
cut-offs for a quintessential spring
outfit spring or summer outfit it's the
same thing at this point it's so friggin
hot yet I'm still wearing my beanie all
right we're going to head into daily
look territory I picked out these
distress acid wash denim skinnies and
they're high-waisted these jeans have a
great hole on the thigh and I've grown
very attached to this hole not sure why
I realized that I own far too many black
boots so I thought I'd switch it up a
not by picking out these chloral coral
platforms I just love how sky-high they
are and I think the coral punch of color
is going to be really great to wear with
all the neutrals I have in my closet so
I've been on a hunt for some nice
boyfriend jeans and luckily style mondo
to pair it had these distressed
boyfriend jeans which are the perfect
length because when you buy it stuff
from Asian stores and you're petite it
just kind of works up because people are
short there and so they accommodate to
our needs anyway they're the perfect
baggy fit and they're so comfortable
that it's kind of stupid so the next
items are from Motel rocks this top is
just a summer essential that I'm gonna
stock in my closet it's just a normal
black halter tank but it's cropped and
it ties up on the neck and just leaves
your back just looking completely
exposed I like that it's got a really
athletic look to it so I thought it'd be
something interesting to add to my
closet next I've got these very veiny
looking high-waisted shorts and I just
love how shocking pink they are I think
it's gonna look awesome to pair with
dark pieces of my wardrobe to it you
still have a summer feel but maintain
the fact that I love black so the next
series of items are from plunder and
these are my monthly picks my first item
is a top with a snarling wolf on it and
the print is on both sides and if
anything the one in the back is a lot
more in-your-face so that way people of
all directions can see that there's a
wolf on your body next up I've got these
trousers shorts they're this dusty baby
blue color and I like the slight paper
bag fit that they have they're not tight
at all so that means they've got kind of
a flowy feel to it and I'm excited to
wear this with a cobalt blue blazer the
next item is this pink cropped top that
has these huge openings on the arms
which is probably gonna come in handy
for the summer because I don't know I
probably need some ventilation and the
sleeves tie into bows on the edge and I
think the bows are cool because it adds
some movement to you and interest with
each arm swing dresses are pretty tricky
for me because most dresses are too long
and they hit me at an awkward length but
luckily it's easy to bypass that and
it's simple as just rolling up the dress
and just safety pinning it so remember
if something that you ordered online
doesn't fit you it's quite simple to
hack it and make it fit the way you want
it to stripes are a complete weakness of
mine I picked out this striped cardigan
and I like how these stripes are huge
blocks instead of just thin ones and I
like how open the pail is just break off
and segment the pattern I love how the
arms are fitted because that may
sit oversized but it doesn't swallow me
completely so believe it or not I have
two very fuzzy pieces in this hull and
this is number one no it looks hideous
just on my hand maybe you think it's
hideous when I'm wearing it too but I
love it I love how it drapes and how
long it is it has a very 90s element to
it you know things are in lovely
wholesale these boots are a knockoff of
the studded Chloe ones and if you're not
looking to dish out some big bucks these
are a great option for you I picked off
the white boots because I thought it
would coordinate better with spring and
summer outfits the quality of the shoe
isn't bad it's probably equivalent to
forever21 standards and I'm pretty sure
they're not gonna last me ten years but
they're gonna get you through the year
and they're true to size and they're
quite comfy I love the color mustard so
I picked out this mustard short sleeve
sweater
it's got distressed detailing and it's
oversized and has a batwing sleeve and I
believe it's one size fits all and I
think that holds true because I think
the sweater
I think this sweater can fit ladies of
all sizes here is a second and last
fuzzy item in this haul it's this cream
fuzzy cardigan and I think fuzzy things
can be kind of tricky because sometimes
there's just too much fluff and it makes
you look bigger than you actually are
but this one has the right amount of it
the following items are from thread
sense statement pets rule and I think
it's the easiest way to pretend that you
really thought out of your outfit when
really it just took you five seconds to
pon it and because it's such a busy
pattern I just mellowed it out with a
share button down next step I've got the
shredded tan cut-offs and from a
distance it makes me look like I have no
pants on but it's all good the observer
will figure it out when they come closer
and just a side note I think that these
shorts would look awesome with girls
with darker skin tones because then the
shorts were really pop okay so now we're
gonna move on to the three items that I
picked at Miss Cal come to check out
this psychedelic sweater it's a rainbow
knit that says acid on it and it's
pretty great because it's kind of like a
drug trip brought to life in form of an
article of clothing I love the mix mash
of colors in the sweater and the way the
sweater shreds
this nice trippy scalloped edge i
recently warned this as a beach cover-up
last week and it was a hit at the shore
to be honest i picked out this shirt
because that doom on it and i associate
doom with movie doom generation some
critics call it a cult classic and
others call it a piece of you could
be the judge for yourself but i liked it
the lagering on this shirt is this cool
metallic holographic ink and so I think
it'll catch the light in a very
futuristic way the next item is a purse
and it's see-through you can call it
tacky tween you can call it wanting to
get mugged but I love it in all its
glory
it comes equipped with a pink bag just
in case you want to hide your items or
you can just stuff all your things in it
and have it in plain sight it's all up
to you
my next items are from choice calm the
first item is a sheer top with these
hands around the collar and this looks
like something that the designer Elsa
Schiaparelli would create because it's
got very surrealist elements to it the
hands around the neck is quite
tongue-in-cheek and if you really want
to get political it's kind of like a
social commentary on the concept of
power but that's just reading way too
much into a shirt next item are these
green tribal Schwartz they're bold
high-waisted pattern statement seeking
and kind of jungle looking and I'm out
of adjectives to describe these the next
items of clothing are from a web store
called she inside this Bart Simpson crop
top is a total ripoff of the Jeremy
Scott collection but whatever you can
have the entire look for a fraction of
the price and I grew up watching The
Simpsons so this top is a fun little
throwback I picked out this white sheer
long-sleeve because my other Ayrshire
button-down got ruined in the wash so I
thought I'd give another go because this
is a total closet essential the fact
that you can wear it with pretty much
any bottom makes it an awesome piece
moving on I'm holding this grid crop top
it's super oversized but it drapes quite
nicely and the batwing is also a nice
flowy effect for breezy days when the
wind can hit it anoraks are a total
staple in my closet so I think that this
beige one just exemplifies the summer
and the number one reason why I love
these types of jackets is because of the
pockets they're really deep set so that
means that you have an option to not
wear your purse if you don't feel like
it okay we're almost at the finish line
these last items are from chic Nova so
where I live the weather has hit 90
degrees Fahrenheit so it's definitely
short season so we're gonna start off
with these high-waisted shorts that are
in this very lush Sienna color and it's
got quite an equestrian look to it
because of the double breasted buttons
another pair I received are the striped
yellow high-waisted shorts
I just want to shimmy into these bad
boys and strut on the pier or something
with soft-serve and the last item is
this cross printed short and I love how
these crosses are just like the addition
sign they're super comfortable because
they're made out of that denim material
that gives you some leeway to eat a meal
and not feel like you're wearing this
metal corset on your butt alright so the
haul is done if you have an Instagram my
user name is I'm Jenna you can follow me
if you would like thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you guys next one
