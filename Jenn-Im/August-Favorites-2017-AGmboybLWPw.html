- Hey everyone!
It's your girl, Jenn, and here I am
in my kitchen slash living room.
I thought I would just
switch up the background
to keep you guys on your toes.
Let me know if you like
it, don't like it, neutral,
let me know!
I have gathered all my
favorite things of August.
I can't believe it's over.
Summer is gone, y'all.
It doesn't feel like it's gone.
We're going through this
crazy heat wave in LA,
but regardless I've gathered
all my favorite things
and I'm going to present them to you
like we do every, single month.
If you enjoy videos like this
make sure you're subscribed.
Buttons down below, and let's start.
So let's talk about shoes first.
Here I have my white
sneakers from Superga.
I actually got this last month
when I was in the Hamptons with Revolve,
and they have just been
my favorite sneaker,
other than my Vans, I love my Vans.
But these are a close second.
These are the shoes that I also styled
in my Eggie look-book,
while I was in Toronto.
They just went with every, single outfit
and I feel like a pair
of crisp, white sneakers
just adds a nice casual elements
to any ensemble.
Since I am five foot one,
the one inch platform is very nice
because when you're this short,
every inch counts.
And yeah, I really enjoy these shoes
and I thought I would give
them a little shout out.
So let's move on to some beauty products.
Here is a concealer that I've been loving.
This is by Hourglass and
I am the shade natural.
I know there's this trend on YouTube
where people are just skipping foundation
and just concealing where they need to
and I just jumped on the wagon
because my skin behaves most of the time,
it's a combination of genetics
and my skincare, and just the
amount of water that I drink.
I drink a lot of water.
I mean my sippy-cup is
always being refilled.
But regardless, this have been
my favorite concealer to use
because it's very precise
and I like the consistency.
Like most people, I have dark under eyes
and this guy just conceals everything
and so I just do it underneath my eyes,
around my nose,
a little bit on my forehead and chin,
and I just blend that baby out.
For example, I'm not
wearing any foundation now,
just this concealer,
and I think it's doing
a pretty bangin' job.
Another beauty product
that I want to talk about
is this spray from Too Faced.
It is their Hangover three in one
replenishing primer and setting spray.
I first heard about this
from my girl Jackie.
She actually showed it
to me right over there.
We did a collab video,
so if you haven't seen
that also hit the cards.
But, yeah, ever since
she's told me about it
I have been hooked on it.
I have only used this as a setting spray
and it just keeps my face
looking fresh and glowy.
It's just been really interesting
to see all these different
types of make up trends,
because a couple of years ago
it was all about that
matte, glamorous look,
and now it's all about dewey,
highlighted, fresh skin
and I feel like this spray
really helps me achieve that look.
Alright folks, let's move
on to the book favorites.
I actually have two this time
which is really exciting.
I was traveling a lot this month
so I had a lot of time
to kill on the plane.
So the first one is
called The Untethered Soul
by Michael Singer.
And this was recommended
by one of you guys,
so thank you so much
because this book has
been just life changing.
I feel like just the past few months,
my journey with spirituality
and self-awareness has just skyrocketed.
I still have a long way to go
but I just feel so much
more connected with myself.
And this book in particular,
it made me just reevaluate my
relationship with my thoughts.
I don't know about you
but my thoughts are constantly racing
and when I'm feeling sad, anxious, or mad,
my thoughts can distort
and sometimes I'll think
some really crazy things.
And this book has made me reevaluate that,
made me step back and see
my thoughts as an observer.
It's made me just more calm
and more at peace with myself
and I feel like with the
combination of meditating,
reading books like this,
going to the gym,
I just feel a huge improvement
with my mental health.
And I just highly recommend this book
if you want to just see your
thoughts in a different way
and be more at peace with yourself.
My next book favorite is
called Rich Dad Poor Dad
and this was actually recommended to me
by my friend, Amy, aka
VagabondYouth here on YouTube.
If you don't know her channel
please subscribe to her.
She's got a really fun spirit
and a great perspective on life.
So check her out, if you haven't already.
Anyway, so this book is
about financial education.
At school we really
learned nothing about this.
Like, we have econ class, but
that's about the government.
And a lot of us learned
to manage our money
through our parents or our friends,
and still I feel like that's not enough.
And I feel like this book
has just really changed
my whole perspective on my finances.
Now whenever I purchase something
I ask myself, is this an
asset or is this a liability?
And obviously there are
things I want to purchase
because I want to treat myself,
so it's all about a balance.
But in the grand scheme of things
you want to have more
assets than liabilities.
Once you're more conscious
of saving your money,
absolutely start investing.
So whether that's in a
stock or a municipal bond,
you gotta start a 401K, etc.
It's all in this book,
so please check it out.
I feel like if you want to start learning
how to make your money work for you
rather than the other way around,
start reading this.
A lot of you guys know this by now,
but I launched my clothing
line, Eggie in August
and it's just been such
an incredible experience.
Thank you so much for the
overwhelming amount of support.
I had to put it in my favorites
because this is such a
huge milestone for me.
And I also wanted to talk about
my favorite piece in the line.
It was very tough to narrow down
but I gotta talk about
the Truck Along Jacket.
I feel like I've always been
attracted to really shiny things
and so that's why this patent
has just been catching my eye.
Fall is just the time to be
super bold with your layering.
This is also a really insulating fabric
because this material is so dense
and unfortunately I haven't
been able to wear it in LA
because it's just been so incredibly hot
but once the temperature starts to drop
I am definitely going to be rocking this.
I also can't wait to show you guys
the new styles that are
going to be dropping
at the end of September
and also in November
and then beyond.
This is only the beginning,
so be prepared for a lot
more Eggie in the future.
So my last favorite is going to be an app
that I've been using the entire year.
I have kind of become a
gym rat the past year,
I lost 15 pounds since 2016
and I'm gonna do a whole new video
on how I lost that weight.
But one of the reasons why
is because I've been using
this app called Seconds.
This is basically like, not
like a personal trainer,
but I've made it my personal trainer
because I have created all
these personal timers for me.
So I go on the StairMaster for 20 minutes
and I don't just go on it
without having this timer,
because this really breaks
it down into sections for me.
So I'll used the advanced hit timer,
so for five minutes I'll just be
walking on the StairMaster
at like a good 11,
and then for 30 seconds
I'll just be running
on the StairMaster,
and then for a minute and 30 seconds,
I'll just be walking and
then running for 30 seconds.
So I do this six times
and by the end of it
I'm literally drenched in sweat
and after that,
that's when the real workout begins.
I'll do my strength training.
So I'll go on one of my workout playlists,
and this one has like
13 different exercises,
and I'll do this three times.
And so that's why it's
become my personal trainer
because I'll just put my headphones on
and I'll just let the timer run
and then I'll just listen to it.
I'm gonna do a separate video
where I go more in depth
with my workout routine
and also what I eat
and just how I lost the weight.
Because my past video
on how I lost 10 pounds,
things have changed,
and I have definitely worked my butt off
to lose the weight
and I can't wait to share
those tips with you.
Alright guys, that is
a wrap on my favorites.
As usual, please write down your favorites
in the comments down below,
also I'm looking for like a film favorite.
I'm looking for like a good,
psychological thriller,
or like a Sci-fi fantasy adventure film.
Write it in the comments down below,
I would love to check it out.
Lastly I just want to thank you guys
for the love and the support.
I feel like, I've been
feeling it extra this month.
So I just want to be able to
send that right back to you.
Thank you so much.
I hope you guys had a beautiful weekend
and I'll see you guys in the next one.
Bye!
