means it's back to school and in my
feeble attempts to get you all excited
and pumped up I've made a ton of
different back-to-school outfit ideas
for a medley of different styles so
whether you're an edge risk-taker or a
girl a girl or a wild child or all three
I got you covered
I'll begin with my uber casual outfit
and this is my version of just the jeans
and a shirt I love huge oversized tops
that drink because they feel so free and
airy I don't think it gets any more
comfortable than that and these are my
favorite pair of jeans I think I feature
them at least once or twice a month and
I'm wearing my Jeffrey Campbell castro's
because they can take a lot of wear and
tear I remember my campus having a lot
of Hills so it was important for me to
wear some comfy shoes I kept my makeup
pretty minimal and just added a soft
pink lip and then twisted my long bangs
out of my face
my bohemian look is essentially the
casual girl on fashion steroids
everything is turned up a notch
aesthetically but the comfort factor is
still the same I know a lot of school
districts have dress codes so you're not
allowed to wear sleeveless tops but you
can still wear them by wearing something
long over it
I chose this dark shawl with this
amazing embroidery all along it the
shawl also covers this really nice
netting detail on the shorts so at a
glance the school authorities won't be
able to see it but you and your friends
will see it and that's what really
matters for accessories I just added
this tiered bracelet my friend Rihanna
and gifted me around a year ago and then
finished off the look with these nice
flat sandals which have this thick
stretchy band
next up I've got an outfit for the chick
who likes to a very proper and isn't
afraid to wear some crazy statement
pants these have this really interesting
often on stripe design and I really like
how they're inconsistent because it adds
a nice Corp to them and since the pants
were a smidge big I threw on this big
woven belt and whenever I wear really
loud prints I like to balance it out
with a plain white top because it's the
ultimate complementary clothing item I
bought this recently at a Topshop when I
was in Chicago a few weeks ago and I'm
wearing my block Jeffery Campbell's I
forget the name of the model but I
wanted to add a thick chunky 90's heel
to it and since my outfit is essentially
colorless I'm wearing this warm coral
shade on my lips to brighten everything
up
it's been a long time since I've worn
pink but I wanted to change that and I
style the super girly outfit for you I
dug up my old pale pink skater skirt and
then paired it with this black and white
faux collared shirt it comes off a
little bit too precious on its own so I
threw on this beige linen moto jacket
with these really nice loose lapels I
think it really tones it down and I'm
still bringing that same lip color from
the previous outfit because I'm not
gonna lie I was too lazy to take it off
and for shoes I chose my black pointy
flats that have a flash of gold on the
tips of the toe I think it's so rad and
there's also gold on the heel I think it
adds a nice glimmer to each step I made
a complete 180 from the girly girl and
switching it to the tomboy I know one
item that Tom boys love are just
comfortable graphic tees I got mine on
sale at Urban Outfitters right after
Halloween for six bucks and it's an
awesome pajama top as well I wore my
baggy boyfriend jeans with these minor
distressed details because they're more
of a masculine loose fit and I think
that just goes hand in hand with tomboy
fashion I also picked out my studded
sandals which were also a part of
randoms gift a year ago and I'm wearing
that same coral lip from the last
outfits
the wild child is that chick who takes
fashion risks and isn't afraid to try
out different trends all at once I'm
wearing this cream flowy fringe shawl
that looks amazing when the wind hits it
I think the flower print is really
reminiscent of the 60s and reminds me of
the whole hippie counterculture movement
to add on to the free spirit vibes I
wore a cream top with this nice subtle
daisy pattern it really stands out once
you're closer to it I accessorized it
with this gold and silver Crescent
necklace I got at forever 21 and then I
just tied my hair into two braids and I
went for a darker lip because I thought
it looked more unexpected and different
so those were all my back-to-school
looks for high school college is coming
up next so stay tuned for that comment
and let me know what type or types of
fashion related to and also what are you
guys going back to school
I know it's sometime in August which is
cruel because it's technically still
summer my Instagram and Twitter is I'm
Dunham in case you didn't know and I'll
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
