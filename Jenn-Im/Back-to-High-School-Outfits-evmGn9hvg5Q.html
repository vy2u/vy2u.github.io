to be the back-to-school outfit video
and it's gonna be geared towards those
who are in high school I have a separate
video with best school outfits for those
who are in college or uni as the Brits
call it so stay tuned for that I'm gonna
walk you guys through on what I would
wear for the first pic of school and
it's not a template that you guys gonna
follow it's just I don't know I just
wanted to have a little bit of structure
to my video but I mean you can wear
whatever the hell you want if you stay
tuned then in the video there's me a
giveaway okay
so for Monday I like to keep it
relatively casual because everyone's
probably gonna dress up to the nines
today so I kept a casual with this nude
floral top and I'm totally digging the
cutout straps and if this kind of table
violates your dress code I got your back
because you just add a vest to it
because that way it's a lot more covered
up and I think it abides by law the
dress code and I wanted to have a little
bit of a 90s feel to it so I went denim
on denim and for accessories I picked
out this thrifted belt and I thought the
angular buckle was a really cute touch
for head accessory I went with a black
turban and for jewelry I'm wearing this
aerostats ring and because it's really
statement I just wore it by itself and I
thought the bronze went really well with
the hardware on my cutout boots and
these are so comfortable I can wear walk
around these all day
Tuesday is the day that I would dress a
little bit more fancy because I'm pretty
sure everyone has exhausted their best
outfit on Monday so you might recognize
this cardigan from my last goodwill haul
and yes it's serving me really well I'm
still in love with it I thought it
looked most excellent with my lace top
which is also in my goodwill haul and
like I've said I think the pattern makes
it look formal but the silhouette the
t-shirt silhouette makes it super casual
for school and for shorts I decided to
pair it with these peace sign shorts I
think that the print is modern because
it's in a classic black and white shade
and for accessories I picked up this
gold choker from forever 21 and for
shoes I just slipped on these tan
lace-up saddle boots from goodwill and I
just blasted them with Lysol I don't
know the proper method of cleaning
thrifted shoes but that's just what I
did
when I was going in high school
Wednesday was late start so I kind of
took out this day to kind of dress up a
little bit more and play with trends
that I'm a little bit apprehensive about
I know these shoes are kind of out there
but I love them unconditionally they're
kind of like my ugly stepson that I
adopted but I don't know I love them
regardless
and since my shoes are the star piece I
went with this really solid and neutral
battling top and I think black is always
classic but the material of this skirt
is what makes it really unique and I
think the pleats are absolutely gorgeous
and I paired the outfit with some sheer
socks from American Apparel and to kind
of play along with that schoolgirl look
I went along and cinched my waist with
the silver belt that I thrifted at
Goodwill and for accessories I just
basically piled a bunch of crap on my
wrists I'm starting from my right I'm
wearing this Union watch that I got as a
gift and on my other wrist you guys have
seen these bracelets before they're from
eBay and from 21 and on my lips I
decided to go with a very dark vampy red
lip kind of roughing up the look I want
to keep it casual and Thursday and
nothing is more casual than layers and a
banty and I think this jacket is a
staple in my closet
I'm loving the gold hardware on it and I
mean look at that leather sleeve it's
it's amazing and I think it just kind of
ties in the entire look and I'm just
wearing my joy Division shirt and it's
for the album Unknown Pleasures if you
haven't listened to it go take a listen
to it and maybe you'll like it and I
don't know if you guys know this but I
have scoliosis so I think a cute
backpack is kind of mandatory for me and
I love it because I think olive is a
neutral color it goes with a lot of
things I mean other than red because
then it kind of becomes kind of
Christmasy this skirt is probably the
fanciest part of my outfit but I think
it's still casual especially because
it's a dark floral and it's asymmetrical
and I think it's kind of a discreet and
kind of demure way to show off your legs
stop being so in-your-face about it and
for shoes I chose another comfy ankle
boot and I think it literally goes with
absolutely everything and of course no
outfit is complete without my being
I am obsessed with that I'm sorry and
for my lips I just went with a very
neutral color so Friday is the last day
thank God and I think it's time to just
kind of go crazy with it I personally
would wear something that can go from
day to night because who knows maybe
after school I'm gonna go out or
something anyway this is the dress that
we're gonna give away at the end of the
video so stay tuned so you can see how
you can possibly win it anyway to kind
of make it a little bit more casual I
decided to wear it with a leather jacket
to kind of toughen it up make it a
little bit more badass and in case it's
chilly
I wanted to layer so what else then my
tri-blend cardigan and I went with a
really bright coral lip and for my head
accessory with a beret why not and I
wore my insane platforms my algas or
Helga's from Dean juries and they're
really easy to walk in
