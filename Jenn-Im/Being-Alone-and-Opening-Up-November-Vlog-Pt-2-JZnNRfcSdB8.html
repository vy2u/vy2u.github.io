- Okay, hi, guys.
Welcome to part two of the November vlog.
I am all spruced up
because I'm heading out.
I'm heading out to two events tonight.
I'm going to Raye's makeup launch.
She did a collaboration with BH Cosmetics.
And then after, going
to the Too Faced event.
So yeah, got a full night ahead.
I'm gonna give Chippo
her little bully stick,
and then I'm on my way.
Here is Raye's palette.
It's actually the exact
same color as my robe.
Wow.
I really coordinated well with this, geez.
Dang, this looks delicious.
We are at Too Faced event.
And they have McDonald fries!
- McDonald fries!
- [Man] Have you seen the dachshund?
- [Woman] Oh, my God.
It's like throttling the floor, okay?
- I am halfway being ready,
but I just made some lunch.
This is dak-bokkeum-tang.
It's one of my favorite Korean dishes.
But yeah, I'm about to dig in.
Also, I forgot to mention that Ben
is out of town for a total of 10 days.
He is in England.
He hasn't visited in two years.
And so it's been just really amazing
and surreal for him to be back.
But yeah, that means that
I have the house to myself.
I'm home alone.
Yeah, I haven't been
home alone in this long.
And part of me feels good,
because it just really
tests my independence.
And it also makes me realize
how much Ben actually does for me.
For example, cooking,
he pretty much takes care of all of that.
And then filming.
And so, yeah, it's been a good transition
because it makes me appreciate
all the things that Ben does.
And yeah, I really do miss him.
But it's good to get some
time away from each other.
When you are in such a long relationship,
sometimes distance makes
the heart go fonder.
But yeah, I'm gonna eat this.
I'm frickin' starving.
Oh, my God.
I decided to throw in some
broccoli just so I feel better.
(jazzy hip hop music)
Mm.
- The bad Christmas?
- I don't know, it's like Willy Wonka.
(gasps) Wow.
Oh, my gosh, look at our dinner
for four for two with Aimee.
My God.
(sighs) This feels so nice.
Isn't that right, Chippo?
Hi. (laughs)
It feels so rewarding to
just lay down and do nothing.
But yeah, I just got back home.
Today we went to the
Happy Place exhibition
as you saw in the previous clips.
It was really cool.
A really fun, bright,
positive installation.
It is temporary, though.
It ends on January 7th,
so if you happen to be
in the Arts District and you have tickets,
I definitely recommend you go.
Right now I just got back
from dinner with Aimee.
It was so amazing, again,
to meet up with her.
We have been trying to have
dinner for the longest time,
but with both our crazy schedules,
it's been like a mission to plan.
But the stars aligned, and we
met, and it was so awesome.
We talked for a good three
hours in that restaurant.
Even though Ben's not here,
I still love just sleeping
on my side of the bed,
because it feels weird
being in the middle.
Chippo's taking his spot.
Before I go to bed, I think I'm gonna read
a couple chapters of The War of Art.
My brother gave this to me
for my birthday present.
Or it was one of his
birthday presents to me,
and I'm excited to continue with it.
Definitely going in my faves.
♪ But I like that girl too much ♪
♪ I wish I never met her ♪
♪ Hello ♪
Hello, happy Saturday.
I'm shooting with Jami and Kaile.
Can you see 'em?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- There you are, and then Keith
is our lovely photographer.
- Hey.
- Hello.
And then here's Janice
helping out.
- Hi.
- But yeah, we are at our second location.
Check it out.
I know it looks very
decrepit, but trust me,
we're gonna make it look very chic.
We are at our third location.
Keith has found this
really cool tangerine wall.
And I'm wearing my little
country bumpkin outfit.
(jazzy hip hop music)
Happy anniversary.
- Thank you.
- [Jenn] Here we are at Dae
Bok Jung about to have some,
I don't even know what this is called.
- [Dad] Huh?
(speaking foreign language)
Nakji.
Nakji?
- Nakji jeol pan.
- Nakji jeol pan.
- Celebrating my parents' anniversary.
Hi.
Welcome to our trunk.
- Hi.
- This is Vincent.
Katie.
- Hi, I'm Vincent.
- Hello.
- You guys have seen
them in my vlogs before.
But basically, we're doing
a little shoot today,
shooting Eggie, and then Katie has put
her little flair in with her wardrobe.
(Katie giggles)
Yeah, it's been awesome.
But yeah, we're on our third look now.
We're all hunched over.
- We're all like, hey.
- I'm wearing Eggie, too.
- I know, Vince season one.
- Yass!
- I love it.
(jazzy hip hop music)
- Cut that you need to listen to,
and then you would be like,
and then you could like, oh, actually,
I don't really like that, and you're like,
oh, I'm okay with that.
- Okay, cool.
Hey, guys.
Today has been a very full one.
I didn't get to vlog too much.
But in the morning, Amy came over
and we filmed The AM with Amy.
By the time you're watching
this, maybe it's already out.
But we basically talked
about negative emotions
and how we deal with them.
I felt really good to talk about a subject
that I don't really talk
about on my channel.
I'm practicing being more
vulnerable on my YouTube channel.
And I think it's just hard,
because I don't wanna come off
like I'm just one-dimensional
and I'm happy all the time.
Obviously, I only like
to vlog when I'm happy,
because I'm feeling
good and I wanna share.
And I don't know.
So it was good for us to talk
about negative emotions that we deal with.
And for me, it was mostly about
stress, anger, and jealousy.
Jealousy is something that
I don't really feel anymore,
which is something that
I'm really proud of.
Because growing up, I was
just so envious of everybody,
whether it was their style, or their body,
or whether they were funny, or smart.
It was a lot.
So I feel happy that I was able
to conquer that negative emotion.
But the two that I wrestle
with are stress and anger.
And anger doesn't happen all the time,
but when it happens, it ain't pretty.
After that, Amy helped
me shoot so many things.
I had a lot of campaign photos due today,
so it was good to get that done.
Then I did some errands.
And then the last clip you
saw was me doing a podcast.
So I did a podcast called
Perfectly Imperfect
with Christine and Regina.
And it was also something
very cathartic for me.
And it's basically as a subject
about connecting the dots,
how we were able to get
to where we are today.
And I didn't expect to get so emotional,
but you know, that's
another thing I wanna share.
I'm a very emotional person.
Any emotion that I'm
feeling, it's just raw.
And I can't control it,
and I feel like I've always struggled with
hiding my emotions.
Maybe it's a good thing,
because what you see is what you get.
I can't fake anything.
And sometimes I wish I could fake it
when I am about to get really emotional.
I had a really difficult call earlier,
and I started crying on the phone,
and I was like, Jesus, get it together.
And then on podcast, I was crying.
I think I'm just going
through a growing pain phase.
I am juggling a lot.
Whenever I feel stressed
or anxious about work,
there's a part of my
brain that's telling me,
no, stop feeling this way.
You should be grateful,
and you should be happy
that you even have this set of problems.
And I think that's what
I'm just trying to deal
with right now, because I
am so grateful for my life.
Even though I, quote unquote, have it all,
emotions are always gonna come.
It's like the weather.
Some days it's cloudy,
some days the sun's out,
some days it's a little foggy.
And you can't control it,
but you just have to
roll with the punches.
For that podcast, I think I got emotional
because I was just really
connecting the dots,
and every dot that I made,
it all kinda stemmed from where I,
what my childhood was like.
I don't know, I think growing up,
I've always had really low self-esteem.
It's crazy how much I
still carry that today.
I'm realizing I really can't
control what you think of me.
All I can do is find
inner peace with myself,
and that's what this year has been for me.
I'm trying to figure out
the core of who I am,
and just being happy with myself.
I am confident in certain things,
but there is still so
much growth to happen.
Talking about my insecurities
and being more vulnerable
is something that's really good for me.
And so yeah, I think by
the time you watch this,
that podcast might be out.
It is a long one, I must say.
So stay tuned.
It feels really good being
home alone, actually.
It's reminding me of how
I used to feel in Oakland
when I had my own space,
and everything I left
it is the way I left it.
And I can't blame anyone
if things are dirty,
because it's my mess.
I freaking miss Ben,
but it's also been really
nice to have my own space.
It's like the first time
I've been alone in two years.
It feels refreshing, but I
think by the time he comes back,
I'll definitely be ready for him to.
But this has been some good
time to reflect on myself.
- [Woman] I injured my
shoulder, this is bad.
- You wanna be in it,
even though we're so dark?
- We did it.
- We did it.
We're so sweaty.
- Our first time actually
hanging out, and we just
sweat next to each other.
- I know, right?
Of course.
- [Blonde Woman] That's
the best way, right?
- It really is.
- Keon, is this where?
- Yeah.
(thumping)
(coughs)
- Morning.
Good morning, Happy Thanksgiving.
I just made myself a delicious
green tea matcha iced drink.
I'm not sure if you're
supposed to have it iced,
but I don't care.
It is hot, and I love iced drinks,
and I think it tastes delicious.
Anyway, since it is Thanksgiving,
I thought that I would tell you guys
some things that I am grateful for.
So the first thing that I'm grateful for
is definitely my health.
I would say that my body
is in fine condition.
I can exercise, I can dance,
I can eat pretty much whatever I want.
When I hear my friends
who have health issues,
whether it is tonsillitis, or arthritis,
or just any sort of chronic pain,
it makes me really feel for them.
It makes me check myself,
and to never take my health for granted.
The second thing I'm
thankful for is my family.
I love that we are finally at a place
where we could all just be
so open with each other.
Even though there is a language barrier,
we're still able to communicate.
That's what I want to express to you guys.
'Cause some of you guys are like,
well, if there's a language
barrier, how do you guys talk?
I mix in Korean with English,
and so they understand more English words,
but they can't speak it,
just like I can understand more
Korean than I can speak it.
I am also so thankful for the
relationship I have with Ben.
Before I met Ben, I didn't really think
that marriage was for me, honestly.
Kinda weird, but I really thought that
love was just kinda about settling,
'cause no one could be perfect.
And I have never,
I've always been a realist,
and never romantic.
And so I thought maybe, I don't know,
like when I was younger, I
was like, maybe I'll marry
if I want to eventually
reproduce or something,
and I would settle for the best companion.
Ben just completely
changed my mind about that.
It's weird, whenever I get
those comments being like,
wow, Ben's so lucky,
I'm like, no, I am the lucky one.
And lastly, I am so grateful for you guys.
I couldn't have asked for
a more loving, dedicated,
supportive group of
people to watch my videos.
Thank you, guys, so much.
Honestly, you guys have helped
with my self-esteem so much.
And sometimes when I don't
even believe in myself,
I look at your guys' comments,
and it truly, truly does heal me.
And I wanna thank you
guys so, so much for that,
and I'm so grateful.
Lastly, I am very grateful for my Chippo.
Alright, I am at my old childhood room.
Got James playing Zelda.
- Hi.
- And I also went to the gas
station to get some chips.
We've got Chester's Fries,
they're a constant favorite,
these Munchies Flamin' Hot,
Snyder's as per James' request,
and Hot Cheetos Oven Baked.
These are slightly healthy,
so I thought that I would get 'em.
But yeah, here's my old childhood room.
There's so much stuff in here.
- [James] Yeah, it's
like all my old stuff.
- [Jenn] Yeah.
(both laughing)
Yeah, and all my old paintings.
Just eat it, just eat it. (chuckles)
- [James] Mm, it's good.
(laughing)
- I made it.
- [Jenn] Yeah, papa made some weird,
oh, no, I mean delicious
avocado puree.
- Thank you.
- It's weird.
(laughing)
(speaking foreign language)
- Yum, here is my plate for Thanksgiving.
There is no turkey or the
traditional Thanksgiving food.
We have a nice Korean-style
Thanksgiving every year.
(speaking foreign language)
Mm.
(speaking foreign language)
(woman laughing)
(game pieces jingling)
- 35.
- 35?
- 35?
No.
(game pieces jingling)
Alright, what could it possibly be?
- It's a size small. (laughs)
- [Jenn] Does it mean small?
- Oh.
- [Jenn] Will you be my bridesmaid?
- Oh, yeah.
(Jenn laughs)
Hey, can you be my bridesmaid, too?
- [Jenn] Yeah, of course. (laughs)
(high-fiving)
Aw. (laughs)
- Aw.
♪ They cover their heads ♪
♪ I can't see their faces ♪
- What's up, guys.
I am on my way back from the airport.
I just got qualified
for Global Entry, whoo.
If you don't know what global entry is,
it's something that you can apply for,
and then you don't have
to wait in any lines.
You have TSA Precheck-in,
and then when you come back
from a foreign country,
you don't have to wait
in customs in America.
So I am stoked about that.
As long as you have a clean
record, you're pretty much good.
But yeah, yesterday's
Thanksgiving was so much fun.
It was awesome just getting
to hang with the family.
I ate so much food,
and I brought back leftovers, too.
So I had that for breakfast and lunch.
But yeah, I'm gonna go home
now, and just continue to edit.
He's back.
- I'm home.
- [Jenn] Yay.
- [Ben] I did miss my girls.
- [Jenn] Do you like, (coughs)
do you like Chippo's new haircut?
- It looks cuter than what I thought.
It looks cuter than it usually does.
- [Jenn] Yeah, uh-huh.
- 'Cause it's usually a
bit like a rat, don't you?
- [Jenn] 'Cause her face is cute, though.
- Her face is cute, isn't it, Chippo?
- Oh, my gosh, Ben brought back so much.
Holy cow.
Wow, okay, first we have some chocolates.
This is my dream.
We got Monster Munch.
Wotsits, ah!
- [Ben] Chocolate Digestives.
- Oh, my God.
That is so big.
(Ben laughs)
This is amazing.
- [Ben] Look, it's massive.
I got some things for the guys as well.
- What are these?
- [Ben] English choccies, you know?
- What's this?
Jammie Dodgers.
- Jammie Dodgers.
I'm not sure if you've ever had them.
- I've never had them.
- Bloody lovely.
- Oh, my God, yes.
- Some Skips.
- Some Quavers.
- Yes.
- Some Monster Munch.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, one of the,
I noticed there's a
Wotsit hanging out free.
Some choccy as well.
There's a Wotsit gone loose,
so obviously, one of the boxes--
- Popped?
- They've popped.
- Ooh.
- 'Kay, so we've got to eat them, then.
- Hmm.
- Mm.
- So these are basically like,
like smaller Cheeto Puffs.
But they have like a
lovely, fluffly texture.
- They're delicious, very similar.
I missed you, mm.
- [Jenn] The final one.
- Oh, my goodness.
- [Jenn] I wonder what it could be.
- What could this be, huh?
(Jenn laughs)
Oh, my goodness.
Ah!
- [Jenn] Will you be my bridesmaid?
- I do.
- (laughs) Yay.
- Thank you.
- Aw.
- Aw, thanks, Jenn.
- Okay, so I'm at Steph's place.
- Heyo.
- We just finished
filming a SippingSista.
- I still have some of the first one.
- Oh, really?
Okay, bring it over.
- [Steph] Bring it out,
bring it out.
- Oh, my gosh.
This one was the crowd favorite, though.
- It's beautiful, too.
It's very aesthetically pleasing.
Cheers again.
- I know.
Cheers.
Mm, it's good cold, too.
- Yeah, it's pretty much just apple cider.
It was hot apple cider and whiskey.
I mean, you really can't
go wrong with that combo.
- No, no.
- Apples and whiskey, come on.
- When you used to make us hot toddies,
it was just whiskey and
black tea and honey.
- It was raspberry tea, which is random,
but that's all I had at the time.
- Uh huh.
- Bulleit bourbon.
- And agave.
- A little bit of agave,
and then I had kumquats.
Remember, and I muddled
kumquats at the bottom?
- What?
- That was in San Francisco.
I made that for you one time.
- In your apartment?
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah.
- Dang.
- That was really good.
I love kumquats, 'cause
the insides are super sour,
but then the skin is really sweet.
- And yeah, we filmed a SippingSista.
We made three holiday
cocktails featuring apples.
- Yeah.
- So
by the time you watch
this, it'll already be out.
So hit the card to check it out.
- Thank you, thank you. (laughs)
- [Woman] Oh, my gosh,
that's so pretty, girl.
- Hello, happy Tuesday.
I am at Aimee's house.
- (laughs) Hi, guys.
- We're filming our collab video today.
I just got some nice slippers.
She is styling me in her closet today.
I'm so excited.
We've got a little set-up over here.
We may build it.
But yeah, let's get started.
(jazzy hip hop music)
Cool.
Yes!
Ooh, oh, it looks amazing.
- [Woman] Actually, I think it's like a--
- Fudge.
- Okay, so this is
the sponge cake, right?
- No, that's the butter cake.
- No?
- Butter cake.
- This is the butter cake.
Okay.
- That's the vanilla bean cake
with vanilla bean butter cream.
- Okay, you ready?
- Very excited about this.
Yeah, cheers.
- Cheers.
(woman laughs)
- [Ben] Mm.
- Whoa, mm.
- Mm.
Wow.
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.
- [Woman] What do you like best?
(jazzy hip hop music)
- We're at the Laker game.
I'm with Lauren.
- Sports.
- Sports.
- Sports.
- Action. (laughs)
Drinks.
- Whoo.
- It's the biggest game
of the season, I think.
It's the Lakers and Warriors.
I'm rooting for the Warriors.
Who are you rooting for?
- I'm just here for the Ryu.
- (laughs) For the energy.
- For the energy.
- And then James, who
are you you rooting for?
- I'm gonna commit to the
Lakers, since it's where I live.
(jazzy hip hop music)
- Good morning, everybody.
We are shooting Eggie Drop number three,
the holiday collection.
I've got my glam squad here.
We've got the lovely Mitchell.
- What's up.
- Hello.
And then David, of course.
- What up.
We're reunited.
- I know.
So excited.
- Super excited.
- And lastly,
here she is, yay.
- Oh, hi.
(jazzy hip hop music)
- Outfit number one.
- Sultry.
- Alright, guys.
That is a wrap on this November vlog.
I am obviously in a different place,
because I'm currently in
New Orleans right now.
I'm just gonna sign off here.
Thank you so much for watching,
and I'll see you guys on the next one.
Bye.
