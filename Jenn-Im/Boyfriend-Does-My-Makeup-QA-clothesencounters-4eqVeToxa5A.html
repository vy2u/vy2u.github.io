you guys know and today you'll be doing
my makeup I don't know why me this stuff
is like weird out the bare minimum but
did you do any research at all I looked
at science oafs but it's tough because
psy also doesn't know what he's doing so
it's like the blind leading the blind
um so videos really funny once you're
here if you haven't already um so yeah
let's just go ahead and get started do
this right so first up I am going to do
a primer mm-hmm yeah yes this is where
slightly helped me out because I had no
idea what primer was before so we're
gonna go with this yeah I guess I was
quite fit I really thought it'd be like
a moisturizer all right I'm just gonna
put this primer that's quite a lot
primer
I doubt if I'm supposed to be why do you
like a hand yep okay with soap yeah John
F asks what was the outfit you were
wearing the first time you met slash
dated if you can still remember it
you had that like a headband thing on
didn't you as we're looking at the
photocell the day it's so ridiculous put
up yeah here I don't
me and Stephanie just wore this randomly
in San Cisco what you're wearing
powering this probably something black I
am gonna go with the concealer it's not
quite Foundation yet what do we have I
think this is one that you do under your
eyes right there we go hello up there
maybe about the nose what do that need
to do that can see it in the nose use
this guy quite a lot right years my
favorite guy is a cool little blob
sponge lost luggage
it should be gone oh yeah blow on blow
it on all right called the Beautyblender
Beautyblender that'll be like a bad name
how it's been liking LA so far what does
he miss in England that he can't find in
LA the things are missed from England
obviously friends and family and stuff
but the main thing is actually Heinz
baked beans
um which if you don't know what it is is
because this country for some reason
just doesn't sell it I don't get it
because they're the best things in the
world our beans are really sweet at the
Cubans is the canyon never liked it so
now that they can see that has been
concealed we will go for foundation
you're after a really absurd I'm just
worried about all the intricate parts
which were the eyes and stuff Oh using
my little technique the only way I know
how to do this is just because another
you're doing a makeup us here in
different stages this is one of them
well can you do an English accent and
Ben do an American accent can you please
pass the water it's good it's good
come on a lot of water so I think that's
good knock it down with a powder oh yeah
yes I'm using a Rimmel London London
stay matte this is the one use the big
Brush for oh I mean it looks the same if
you can't ask me Luke Oh what are you
guys gonna be probably n-- de me and
Stephanie are gonna be Ken and Ryu from
Street Fighter and I got this like red
child sized karate suit so I'm excited
but I'm going is 11 if you haven't seen
stranger things a lot of people say I
look like her we go white it's like a 12
year old girl right well it's nice what
do you guys think
nice how about this camera it's kind of
a change angle right so next up we will
go for the eyebrow this guy looks
precisely my brow pencil it's like a
rocket that was this side oh now that's
just got a whole lot more confusing hi
Jen hi Ben what are your favorite things
to do on date night oh for us it's
really eating to me yeah things like
number one top activity so yeah I think
like a Cinna spear you know that the
singing the film in the PAS you know so
nice having a picnic so fun to have our
little picnic basket we really got a lot
use out of that we all love our picnics
just being outdoors and Edie yeah we've
quite outdoorsy as well we like hikes
without doing things of that but we like
staying and we kind of like anything
really so yeah but remember that time we
accidentally typed like 15 miles oh it
was like an Orange County somewhere yeah
let's Anaheim for some lunch
I'm packing house and then we decided to
go for a little uh a little three-mile
hike
lift it up and we had our jeans on you
know run and hiking my Kiehl's boo
look I was gonna be going on a journey
yeah almost was the end there was like a
junction where I got to go left or right
and for some reason you know what it's
like when you're convinced you're right
I wasn't mean I was right and guess who
was correct we're not one of those
couples that I like no I'm right no it
was one of those that I was like look
babe I'm really think I'm right thank
you well I'm sure it's this way but
we'll go yours yeah it was just crazy
like a very smug hike because I was like
yeah boy it was just a really long torso
hope it Walkley we went the wrong way
on it from the three-mile hike turn into
a 10-mile hike potato senpai asks what
were your first impressions of each
other I mean I was pretty much solved
from the first conversation really oh
we're like at a bar in San Francisco
it's very chill yeah dive bar um with
some friends and it was there was like
you know we just we got on while we were
chatting it wasn't anything
um too crazy yeah we didn't like
romantic at all it's supposed to be like
casual yeah get together you know and
you know you know stalking us like this
something about this girl and ironically
we flew back to England like the day
after or something and as we landed I
tweeted you saying good hangs Jen one
end of wanna but it still works somehow
still what you split into ideas after
that you can spend hours doing this
because I've got feeling that I actually
might be spending hours doing this oh
yeah you've been on the Browse room yeah
well do for now
right a little bit heavy dish so I am
going to start with some eye shadow
yeppers so I need a little brush that's
my favorite brush is it yeah the hard
part because there's you've got loads of
palettes I stay edit biased a Lauder
kind of a looker unig India where am I
going
I'm gonna go for more of a nightclub
kind of a fun race you know so you don't
to see all the smudges oh go for a
slightly smoky fire okay sounds good Oh
always clothes please okay what does he
read the next question let me try and do
this
Ellen Chu asks what's the one clothing
item you don't like in jugs
wardrobe every now and again you'll get
like a jacket or something it'll be like
big puppy things with this crazy stuff
and I'll be like I don't like that but
then you'll put on like a nice hat and
bottoms about have you made that work
it's not I can't really think of
anything I don't like I feel like Ben
and I would have quite similar fashion
taste yeah I think there's certain
combinations that just aren't quite
right and I like Ben's second opinion
about it you know what I try to me like
the plaid pants with the distressed
sweater work you're like they're just
such yeah it's a bad fit I love you
because you don't judge what I wear at
all
you're very you just like the most
open-minded person I'm gonna intensify
the eyeshadow now with a lorac Pro I was
loads of options look at that alright so
I want to go for like a dark 100 so I'm
just gonna smoke out the edges here
Julie asks if you both had superpowers
for one day what would you choose to
have uh kind of want to fly fly oh my
gosh okay
just especially downtown you know fight
on the buildings seriously like like
breathing in so much of the small like I
don't think of you have mold it is
before yes so pollution any for my
superpower I'm just going to stick with
my very old answer of just being able to
persuade people have you guys seen
Heroes have you seen here as well no
well there was like this one character
where her power was no matter what she
said the other person just like believed
it so she'd get out of like parking
tickets to get out of like she could
like rob people be like give me your
money like okay so you want to have
superpowers you can rub people no no
wrong anyone but you know it just to
have that much influence yeah the better
being like this is not something you
should do stop this war okay alright you
know you know what Evans like the Stone
Age you should do this and before
they've even asked a question no no no
