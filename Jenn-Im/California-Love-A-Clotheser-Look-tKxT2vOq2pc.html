finished doing the intro and that row
from my date outfit ideas so Ben and I
made it to an Ace Hotel in Palm Springs
and a room is just so beautiful
I've already had such a great morning we
had breakfast and Ben said he was just
going to the gym as I was like editing
the video and he came back and he
basically surprised me with this
gorgeous bouquet of flowers and check
out this awesome picnic set he got us
because we love going on picnics we love
doing stuff outdoors and we love food
obviously so he got us a bottle of our
favorite wine we love Ryoka
and he got us this amazing s'mores kit
how sick is that and then when you open
this basket
so inside there are utensils that are
perfect for picnicking and he knows how
much I like curly straws so he caught me
a bunch of them there's some wine
glasses as you can see and he knows that
I freaking love English baked beans you
guys honestly make the best beans ever I
feel like Americans they make their
baked beans way too sweet these are the
ones that you guys need
they're amazing and then lastly you got
me this gorgeous candle like look at the
exterior of that it looks like some sort
of artifact

how huge it is in comparison to my hand

another photo here God he's such a
