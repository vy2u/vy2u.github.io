video I've partnered with Clinique to
show you these spaces a month I'll be
using their beyond suspecting foundation
and concealer and I'm just going to sit
down and do a little top through mix
tutorial I don't do this very often or
ever so I thought I would just kind of
switch things up if you enjoy makeup
tutorials make sure you subscribe to my
channel and if you'd like to see this
look then keep on watching so here is my
bare face I tweeted out saying that I
was going to do a QA because I'm not the
type of person who could just talk
without any guidelines so I thought I
would just simultaneously do my makeup
and answer some questions so let's start
first I've got my primer I'm using tarts
clean slate timeless smoothing primer do
you have any advice for someone who
lives in a small town so their fashion
always seems so over-the-top compared to
others I feel like this is something
that every fashion oriented person kind
of saw was especially in the beginning
because more bold your fashion choices
become the more you stand out and while
going to college and Davis like the
first couple of weeks it was pretty
daunting because Davis is a pretty
sleepy small farm college town and I
definitely stuck out with my hull razors
and my 5-inch red platforms but it's
only in the first two weeks that feel
kind of weird because after a while
people just get used to you and your
eclectic style and that just becomes the
norm it's just it's just the first
couple weeks that are awkward but after
that it's just smooth sailing so now
that primer is done I'm going to go in
with foundation here I'm using clinics
beyond perfecting foundation concealer
this will look familiar because I put
this in my March favourites I love this
foundation I've been using this for a
couple of months now and it's awesome
it's only $28 and I love that applicator
something about a doe foot applicator
just always gets to me it looks like a
cute little animal foot it's so cute
applicator makes it really easy to put
as much foundation or as little as you
want you really have control on how much
you want to put so see the applicator
just makes it really precise on exactly
where you want to apply it and this is a
full coverage foundation but I just use
as much as I need so I can go with a
light hand or a heavy hand
depending on what kind of look I'm going
for today I think I'm just going to do a
light layer because it just want
something fresh and my skin is behaving
so I'm not going to do too much to cover
that up it's really great because I
don't have to use a separate concealer
because this foundation doubles as one
so it's like a two in one product which
is awesome
so I finished the first layer and now
I'm going to go in again and I'm just
going to really target my under eyes I
know it's some foundations you really
have to rush on blending quickly because
it just drives too fast
but I really like that you can take your
time with this and blend at your leisure
all right so I'm pretty much done
blending this out
it's got like a nice natural matte
finish but it's not cakey whatsoever so
now that it's all blended I'm going to
set that with a translucent powder this
is by Laura Mercier and then with my
Beauty Blender I'm just going to grab
the product and I'm just going to set it
like underneath my eyes around the smile
lines and then a little bit on the
forehead and then I'll grab a big fluffy
brush and then just kind of wipe the
powder away now it is time for the brows
and I'm using this brow pencil by Dior
and I'm also going to answer this
question by Boru 12 how do you organize
your schedule do you have a planner if
so could you perhaps make a video about
it love your work and best wishes thank
you I pretty much live off the calendar
app on my phone literally the second I
get a plan I'll just jot it down onto my
phone that second because I know if I
just put it off and I don't do it then
I'm just going to completely forget so I
always say that the mind is a terrible
office so the second that you have a
plan write it down in your phone whether
it's something digital or whether you
have a hard copy like a physical planner
just jot it down I'll help you segment
off different projects you have so for
example if I have like a huge video
project I like to space it out one day I
will brainstorm what it's going to
happen in the video another day I'll
flush out a full creative treatment and
then another day I'll just do all the
filming that day instead of just
cramming it into one day I interspersed
it into like a nice week so that way I
don't feel too stressed and pressured
when the due day actually comes and
that's exactly waited for school so
habits from school are definitely
incorporated into my work life which i
think is cool but yeah it's better to
just basically out than just feeling
cramped and pressure to do everything
all at once
I live off my happiness planner every
night before I go to bed I schedule
everything that I need to do that day
things I'm excited about and it just
gives my life structure and balance
which I always appreciate man talking
while doing your makeup is not an easy
thing I think if this is as good as my
brows are going to look today let's move
on to eyes shadows now I am using my
generous o'clock lair pot palette I've
been meaning to use twat in a tutorial
so this is that day here is tois it's
like a nice brick read and I'm just
going to pop that all over my lid using
a synthetic brush the next question
comes from Lauren she asks what's the
best dish Ben is made for you and what's
Ben favorite dish of yours lately he's
been making this delicious breaded
chicken it is such a fire dish he makes
a breaded chicken with a bit of mash and
it is just the most succulent but
crunchy thing ever and his bone age is
always a good one too he makes the best
pasta when Ben and I first moved in like
the end of 2015 I was just gaining a
bunch of weight because he just kept on
feeding me such delicious food of and
now I'm going to like kind of pace
myself and portion control but yeah he's
definitely an amazing cook alright so I
brought you guys in the little closest
they can see the color on my lid to
blend it all out I'm using dough and
it's just going to smoke everything out
and make it look more seamless as for my
cooking I feel like my cooking skills
have to change it a little bit since
then and I've been living together but
he always loves my pasta to come that's
like my classic Korean dish that I
always made it's just like a spicy
chicken potato dish he also knows how to
make it now so he makes it better than I
do now at this point which is kind of
sad I feel like Ben and I have a pretty
good system though because he'll cook
and I'll help like chop and stuff and at
the end I'll just wash up so I like the
system that we have now I think
just keep it I'm not mad at that all
right so now I'm using I feel like
everyone always kills me for the
pronunciation of this I'm sorry but this
is for in French yes yes I'm trying but
this is just a dark brown and I'm going
to use that to just really intensify the
look
that's what dark colors do on the eyes
I'm just going to pop that right there
not too much because I still want the
red to show through okay so I've popped
it into the corners of my eyes it looks
a little messy now but I'm going to grab
another blending brush find out some
more and then I'm going to go back in
with tois I'm going to get a flat dense
brush I'm going to pop that onto the
bottom lid just to give it a little bit
more dimension I know red can be a
little intimidating to the eyes but I
swear as long as it's like a nice brick
red and you've got some dimension on the
top I think it looks amazing now I'm
grabbing une and I'm going to apply this
right in the inner corners of their arms
just to kind of highlight the section
and then I'm going to pop that right on
the brow bone I'm pretty happy with the
way this looks I think we can move on to
the eyeliner now alright for eyeliner
using the same ol Kat Von D tattoo liner
we're under a little slick
sorry I cannot talk for this bit this
requires too much concentration that's
fine chugging ice coffee was not a good
idea before filming this so shaky OOP
okay
cat eye is done now I'm going to do a
little bit of mascara I'm using this one
by Lancome this is their grandiose
formula and while I'm doing that I'm
going to answer another question this
one is by Paola what's one of the most
challenging things about being a YouTube
creator whoa this one's a little deeps
but I thought I would mention it because
I think it's good to put some of this
information out there I think for me the
most challenging part about being a
youtuber is definitely the constant
pressure to feel like you always need to
be evolving your content always coming
with something fresh and different
especially at a high frequency and I
feel like this is what is expected
in the arts and entertainment field but
as just one person it's a lot and I feel
like I've never truly taken a break from
doing this I've been doing this for
seven years now
and it's you know there were times where
I definitely felt burnt out I feel like
the YouTube me has changed so
drastically there are a lot more people
that are dumping content into space and
I think it's amazing but it's the fear
of being irrelevant and being stale is
real and the way that I kind of was able
to not be so burnt out is by expanding
my team and so I've got my manager
Ashley who helps negotiate all my deals
who manages timelines i've got dawn my
amazing graphic designer so i don't have
to stress about figuring out how to do
all this photoshop stuff I've got Ben
who is pretty much my in-house
videographer and photographer and now I
even get some help from my friends at
Elle are creative who helped me pump out
some really highly produced stuff that I
wouldn't be able to film on my own I
just feel like YouTube isn't just a
one-person show anymore and it hasn't
been for a while and if you choose to
just hand all these projects on yourself
you are going to drown and you're going
to burn out and so I'm learning that I
need to just expand my team really push
some control over some of my projects
and just delegate these tests out to
other people and that's how you have a
good functioning business I also find it
very difficult to separate myself from
my work because in the end my work is
myself and so let's say a video doesn't
do well or people are taking about
something personal in my life there are
some days where it really eats me up
inside and it hurt because I think
people forget that we're just people too
and on our bad days it's really hard to
separate work from myself but in the end
it is what comes with the territory and
the positives that are in this career
path totally outweigh any of the
challenges and every day I feel so
blessed to be able to do this and I
never ever forget that and it's all
because of you guys you guys have
blessed me with this incredible life and
this is why I work so hard for you guys
I try to put out content that I would
see I want to just do my best for you
guys because you have transformed my
life in so many ways and I never ever
forget that everything has a pro
everything has a con but in the end I am
living my dream job and there is no
negative that I can't overcome because
of it so I know we spend a bunch of time
coding my lashes with this mascara but
I'm just going to go in with some
falsies right now just for the top just
to give it a little boost all right
lashes are on and in full force that's
better so we're going to move on to
contour I'm using the Pony palette in
marvellous so while I'm contouring I'm
going to be answering this one more
lighthearted question this is from
Esther shin
she asked Cossacks is hail what is your
favorite cutoff character my favorite
character is definitely the little
mushroom guy I don't really know what he
is or it is but when he turns around the
back of his head looks like a butt and
you're so cute I always use that guy and
I only use cacao talked with my parents
family members and just pretty much
anyone in Korea for blush I'm using this
little peach guy in this palette going
to pop that on to the apples of my
cheeks mm-hmm and then for highlight I'm
going in with this Stila starlight
Starbright palette I'm going in with
kitten which is the one in the middle
I'm just gonna give myself some dewy
skin so this question comes from Mel and
she asks how do you motivate yourself to
do better in every way
I would say that my motivation has
always kind of been inherently in me I
feel like this Drive is in all of us but
it's just the actions you do to make
this Drive stronger in my life I've
always been an action oriented person if
I see a problem I don't wait around for
someone else to do it like if I can do
something about it I will go ahead and
do it myself
maybe it's because I don't really
believe in Plan B's or I don't have them
they'll fall back on that I just put
100% in everything that I do because I
don't see any other alternative and even
though my best may not be the best in
someone else's eyes it's my personal
best and that's all that I can
you and I think as long as you're
improving even like ever-so-slightly
whether it's personally professionally
or emotionally I think you're on the
right track and that is what motivates
me okay so I think we're pretty good on
the highlighter for my lips I'm using
colourpop's Nadi and this is a really
nice mood alright nice alright guys so
this is the finished look and also the
space of the month I hope you enjoyed
this segment I think it was quite
refreshing to just kind of sit down and
talk with you guys and be a little bit
more candid if you guys enjoyed the
video please hit the like button and
also feel free to leave me a question
for the next face of the month to an a
segment thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you guys in the next one
bye
