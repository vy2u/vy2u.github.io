- Hey everybody, it's your girl Jenn,
and today I'll be showing you
how I did this yellow eyeshadow look.
This has been highly requested
and very long awaited,
so thank you so much for your patience.
Last month was really, really crazy.
I finally had a moment to just sit down,
and just chat and show
you guys how I did this.
Since it's back-to-school season,
I thought I would just
grab a bunch of questions
about college on my Instagram,
and you know, chat about it,
because this is a really exciting,
but also scary time for a lot of you.
So I thought I would put my two cents in,
and also show you how I did this.
So let's get started!
I am gonna hydrate my lips first,
by using Glossier's Mint Balm
Dotcom universal skin salve.
I've used all their formulas,
but the mint one is by far my favorite.
It has like, this nice cooling sensation,
similar to Burt's Bees.
But the packaging is just so much cuter.
Now I'm gonna move on to primer.
I'm using this one by Too Faced.
It is their Hangover Rx.
And this one is probably one
of the most nourishing primers
that I've ever used.
Before, I was just really on the ball
with anything that was like, mattifying
and stuff that didn't make me oily,
but these days,
I've just been enjoying
like, a nice dewy look.
It just looks youthful and in Korea,
you know they like that dewy face,
so that's just the card
I've been playing. (laughs)
Ah, okay so primer is finished.
Now I am just gonna skip
foundation completely,
and I'm just gonna go
directly to concealer.
I'm using this concealer,
this is by Hourglass.
And it is a stick.
And I'm just going to put
it underneath my eyes.
Right over here, wow.
And then I put it around my nose.
A little on my forehead.
And then on my chin.
So basically, all the
dark areas of my face.
And while I'm blending,
I might as well get
cracking with the questions.
(laughs) I've just been
getting carried away
with the makeup.
So this is from korleyan.
&quot;How was community college
compared to a university?
&quot;And if any differences or
similarities between the two?
&quot;Love you!&quot;
First off, community college
kind of feels like high school,
the sequel. (laughs)
You're gonna know a lot of
people there from your school,
but there's also a new flush of people.
Honestly, looking back,
I'm so happy that I went
to community college,
because just the amount of
money I saved from tuition
is just, like, unbelievable.
I was able to just take my time,
and figure out what I wanted to do.
I was not the best student growing up.
I was always just a very average student,
and in the eyes of, you
know, a Korean family,
if it wasn't straight A's,
it wasn't good enough.
And I definitely never,
ever got straight A's.
I think I was really in my head
when I was going to school.
I was just so focused on
trying to get the good grade
and memorizing everything,
that that anxiety and that
pressure actually crippled me,
and once I stopped caring
about what grade I got,
that's when I started
getting good grades. (laughs)
That was my senior year of college.
Because I went to community college,
I was able to really figure
out what I wanted to do.
Obviously, math was not an option for me.
I do not understand how to crunch numbers.
Writing, I was horrible at.
Science, a mystery! (laughs)
And I finally went to my
counselor, and I was like,
I really don't know what I wanna do.
And she said, well what do you like doing?
And I told her that I liked going out,
I liked meeting people,
I liked socializing,
and she told me of this
major called Communications!
But I was able to take
all the units I needed
to be able to transfer.
And once I did transfer, it
was just a whole new world.
I never lived away from home before,
so I got accepted to UC
Davis and UC San Diego.
And I was pretty torn,
because as much as I wanted
to go to UC San Diego,
I wanted to just get the hell
out of southern California.
I was over it.
I wanted to just start completely fresh,
and just be the new
girl at school for once,
because growing up, my parents
never moved, which is great,
because I never had to
feel displaced or anything,
but you know, when you watch those movies,
and it always starts off with like,
ah, the new kid at school.
Who is she?
So I don't know,
I just wanted to basically
get out of my hometown
and just start completely fresh.
And San Diego is only two hours away,
but I wanted to be far.
I wanted people to have
to go on a road trip
or a plane to go see me. (laughs)
If I had to say a difference,
whether like the classes were better
or the professors were
better at community college
or UC Davis, I would say
it's pretty comparable.
I mean, it's really what you make of it.
You can go to the best Ivy League school,
but if you're not there to absorb,
then there's really no point.
And I also would like to say
that what school you go to
does not define you at all.
Maybe I'll do another layer. (laughs)
It's so funny, the day I'm like,
I'm not gonna wear foundation,
I'm like, it's not covered enough.
Alright guys, I think that is blended.
I'm just like punching myself
with this beauty blender. (laughs)
So the concealer is all blended out.
And now I'm gonna seal that with a powder.
I'm going back to an old favorite of mine.
This is the Rimmel Stay Matte Powder.
Look how old this is.
I should have probably gotten a new one,
but you know, this will do.
I'm gonna grab this flat
brush by Marc Jacobs,
and I'm just gonna scrape
what is left of this guy,
and I'm going to put it underneath my eyes
just to set everything.
As you can see, I'm grabbing this,
and I'm just literally patting it,
no swirling, just patting,
because I don't wanna ruin
the good thing we've got going down here.
So now that powder is done,
I'm gonna move onto the brows.
Here I'm using two products.
First I'm gonna use Dior's Brow Styler.
I've mentioned this a
million times before,
but this is just a great pencil
for the meat of my brows.
It's like a nice color shade.
And then for the tails,
I go in with Benefit's
Goof Proof Brow Pencil.
This is a darker color, so it
just really defines the tails.
I like my tails to be the
darkest part of the brow.
&quot;How did it feel when
you moved to UC Davis
&quot;as a transfer student?
&quot;Did you have trouble making good friends
&quot;since people already knew each other?
&quot;Did you feel left out at all?
&quot;Did you join any clubs?
&quot;I'm transferring from a
community college next year,
&quot;so I'm super nervous about that.
&quot;Thank you!&quot;
Being a transfer student
was definitely really hard,
because yeah, everybody
already has their friends.
They have their established
cliques already,
and going in as a transfer student,
I was starting completely from scratch.
And I made sure to use the internet
(laughs) to help me find some friends.
So when I was trying to find housing,
I found this Facebook group,
where it was just for UC Davis transfers
and people who were
looking for housemates,
and I made sure that my profile
was as detailed as possible.
I said where I was from,
what my interests were,
I wrote all my favorite
bands, all my favorite books,
all my favorite films,
and using that profile,
I was able to find someone
that I really clicked with.
And she was going to be my housemate.
She had the same interests as me,
and so it wasn't a huge surprise
when we actually got along.
So she was my first friend,
and she was the person that I
spent my 21st birthday with,
and if you're watching this So,
I love you, thinking about you.
I feel like social media
gets like, a really bad rap.
But it actually helps in the end,
if you utilize it correctly.
Personally, I didn't join any clubs.
I just spent any extra
time filming or editing,
I was just always consumed by my studies
or my YouTube channel, and in a sense,
it was good, because I
became very independent.
I just had to entertain myself (laughs),
so whether it was like, going
to the movie theater by myself
or going to the thrift store by myself,
I was always keeping myself preoccupied.
But if I could go back in time,
I definitely would've
joined at least like,
one club or something,
because I know a lot of
my friends that have been
in organizations and clubs and sororities,
where they have and left
with lifelong friends,
and it would've been really awesome.
So I think if you are
looking for a community,
I would definitely recommend
you joining a club,
because there are good people in there.
So now that the brows are done,
let's move onto the fun
part, the eye shadow.
So I am gonna use Nars'
Radiant Creamy Concealer
as like a primer for my lids.
So I'm just gonna pat
this all over the lid,
and this is just gonna
really enhance the colors
of the eyeshadows.
I literally just
discovered that this works,
so I'm very excited to implement
this into my tutorials.
So once that's all blended out,
I'm gonna grab my yellow
eyeshadow from 3 Concept Eyes.
This is called Yolk,
which is the perfect name.
So it's a very yellow eyeshadow.
I'm gonna grab this flat
brush, this is by e.l.f.
Doesn't have a number, but
it just looks like this.
Yeah, so as you can see,
I'm not swooping it,
or else that would
cause too much fall out.
I'm literally just petting it.
I think maybe the reason
why I didn't join any clubs
was that it was hard to
find time in my schedule,
because a lot of the clubs,
you had to stay at school
even longer than you had to,
and I was always ready to
bounce out after my class,
so maybe that's why I didn't join any.
And then once you get a little closer to,
I guess, the outsides,
that's when I'm able to kind
of swoop it around like that.
So now that the yellow is on,
I'm gonna use this
pallette from ColourPop.
Unfortunately, I don't know the name,
but it's got this nice orange shade in it.
And then with the flat brush,
I'm just gonna put it
all over the under eyes.
I can't forget about the inner corners,
so I'm gonna use this
lighter shade over here.
I'm gonna pop that on my brow bone
and also the inner corners of my eyes.
The power of a shimmer
in the inner corners,
it just brightens everything up.
There is one final
element to the eyeshadow.
I'm using ColourPop's Flipper.
It looks really orange,
but it's actually just a
really nice warm shimmer.
I'm gonna grab my ring finger,
swoop it around like that,
and then I'm just going to
simply pat it all over the lid.
And this is just gonna
make the yellow glittery,
and I know some people don't like shimmer,
but I'm all about that
shimmer, glitter life.
So now that the eyeshadow's finished,
I'm gonna move onto the eyeliner.
I'm using Kat Von D's Tattoo Liner.
I literally use this all the time.
I have yet to find eyeliner
that is very similar to this.
I just like the pen.
I thought it was felt tip, but it's not.
It's actually a brush,
and the way it just goes on
is just so smooth for me.
So now I'm gonna move on to the lashes.
I'm gonna give it a nice little squeeze,
and then I'm gonna go in
with my usual lash primer,
which is Lancome's Cils Booster.
This is from carleemats.
&quot;As a part of the college experience,
&quot;we all have to interact with new people.
&quot;It's easy to start a conversation
with a simple, 'hello,'
&quot;but how do you continue one?
&quot;By the way, I love you and your videos.
&quot;You're such an inspiration.&quot;
Thank you Carlee.
Making conversation with people,
whether you're in college
or outside college
is really tricky and nerveracking,
but it's just something that you gotta do,
you gotta put yourself out there.
It is scary and terrifying,
and there have definitely been
times where I've tried to,
like, try to be friends with someone,
and just be completely shut off,
but you know what, that is
the nature of the world.
You're gonna get hurt,
but what doesn't kill
you makes you stronger.
I would say, you should
try and find something
that you're genuinely interested
in about the other person,
so whether it's their
shirt that you noticed,
or the book that they're reading,
or what they did that weekend,
just try and find some common ground.
And then start tackling them
with the who, what, where, why, and how's.
If you wanna make friends,
you have to genuinely
be interested in them.
That's the only way you're
gonna be able to do it.
Instead of selling yourself,
be interested in that person.
It's like the Dale Carnegie quote.
He said, &quot;You can make
more friends in two months
&quot;by becoming interested in other people,
&quot;than you can in two years
&quot;by trying to get other
people interested in you.&quot;
So ask where they're from,
what their hometown was like,
what kind of friends they have,
what they enjoy doing on the weekends,
what kind of food they like,
what kind of books they like to read,
what they like about the outdoors.
Just literally anything.
And I know asking questions
seems like, so nerveracking,
like, what do I even ask the other person?
Just literally ask them anything.
That's how you get started.
People are like onions, and
the more questions you ask,
the more that you peel them open.
It's like the Shrek movie!
People are like onions,
it's what Donkey said.
(laughs) And that just
really resonated with me.
And some people are harder
to peel than others,
but once you have that outer layer down,
then you've made a friend.
There have been many times
where I've tried to make conversation
with just random people in the street,
and it did not go very successfully.
I was at the usual cafe
that I normally studied at,
Delta of Venus, and I saw this girl
just sitting on the table,
and she looked really cool
and interesting, and I
really liked her outfit,
and I went up to her, and I
tried to make a conversation.
I forgot what I said,
but literally after
like, the third question,
she just stood up and walked away.
And I remember feeling so freaking small,
and so stupid.
And that kind of made me not
want to talk to other people.
I was like, you know what, (bleep) it.
Like, if they don't wanna be my friend,
like I don't wanna be other
people's friend either.
But being alone only takes you so far,
and obviously, the
loneliness just got to me,
and I had to just put
myself out there again.
And not everyone is gonna be like that.
Not everyone is gonna be a dick.
Not everyone is gonna
be super nice to you,
but the point is you gotta keep on trying.
Once you find a good egg,
once you find a good person,
just stick with them and
treat them with respect,
ask them everything about them,
and I don't think it's weird,
like looking at their social media.
All the people in my life,
I genuinely wanna know what they're up to,
so I'm always stalking them
on their Insta Stories,
their Instagram, their Facebook.
I wanna know what they're up to.
Use social media to kind
of prepare the questions.
So if you saw, I don't
know, a classmate going to,
I don't know, go on a hike or something,
ask them, oh my gosh,
like how was that hike?
How many miles did you walk?
What kind of trail was it?
Do you enjoy hiking?
Do you like nature?
Like (laughs) it all kind of flows.
I think it's all about just
starting the questions,
and then getting used to that,
and just being genuinely
interested in other people.
And then they'll be interested in you.
Hey wow, that was a very
long-winded question.
I've already put the primer on my lashes,
and as they're drying, I'm
gonna move onto contour.
This is Tarteist's Pro Glow.
Pro Glow Palette. (laughs)
and I'm gonna use this shade's sculpt,
and I'm just gonna start
chiseling the cheeks.
Just gonna warm this up.
Then I'm gonna use the other side,
and I'm just gonna start
contouring the nose a little bit.
I've tried to use cream contours,
but it's literally so difficult
for me to blend it all out,
so I just like to stick with the powders.
So now that the contour is
done, I'm gonna move onto blush.
This is by Hourglass, it's
in Incandescent Electra.
And we'll see how this goes,
it's my first time using it.
Let's give it a whirl!
&quot;What's the most important
thing you learned
&quot;about yourself in college?&quot;
I would say that I learned
to multitask really well.
Like, I was able to handle
four to five subjects
in like a quarter or a semester.
And if I was able to multitask that,
then I can definitely juggle
all the projects I do now.
I also learned how much
my parents do for me.
Because when I had to move out,
I, you know, you get that reality of like,
whoa, I need to do all my dishes.
I need to cook for myself,
I need to do laundry.
It just made me appreciate
my parents so much more.
They do a lot of things for
us that we don't even realize,
and moving away from home
is sometimes the only way
you can realize that.
So blush is done.
I'm gonna go back into
the Tarteist palette.
I'm gonna use Strobe.
And I'm just going to
put that all over the tops of my cheeks.
Oh my God, this smells so good.
It smells like chocolate.
This is how I get so carried
away with highlighter.
This is actually good, because
it's not too pigmented.
Because sometimes when it's too pigmented,
I really just look like
a shiny mess. (laughs)
So now that the face is done,
I'm gonna go back to the eyes.
I'm using this mascara from Shiseido.
This is their waterproof one,
and I'm just gonna coat
the bottom of my lashes.
Oh.
I'm just gonna do a
light layer for the top.
Nothing too crazy,
because I'm just gonna pop
some falsies on anyway.
For falsies, I'm using
these ones by Velour.
This is probably my fourth
or fifth time wearing these,
and I would say they're
still in good shape.
So I think I finally nailed
the tools I need for falsies.
I have this lash applicator from Velour,
and then I also have been
loving Velour's new lash glue.
This is so sticky.
It's awesome.
Like, I used to use Duo before.
But this formula is just miles better.
So let's finish this off with a lip color.
I'm using Dohee by ColourPop,
which is my personal shade.
Unfortunately, this is
not available anymore.
So just find a nice coral shade
in your collection to apply.
Okay, alright!
I guess I could answer,
like one last question
before I head out.
This is from brittany.tran.
She asks, &quot;How do you deal
with homesickness in college,
&quot;and being away from home?&quot;
I remember after two or three
months of being in Davis,
I was like, oh my God, I
have to stay here for like,
another year and a half?
And that was very de-motivating,
but after I don't know,
I think after like a good
year, Davis felt like home.
And I think it's all about
just staying connected
to the people back at home,
whether it's, I don't know,
like phone calls, emails, everything.
Just make sure that you
always have a part of home
inside you, and you'll just
be stronger after that.
I think it's just all part of the process,
because it makes you
appreciate where you're from
so much more.
And I was really lucky,
because a lot of my friends
back at home would come visit me,
like maybe two or three times of the year.
Maybe two.
But still, it was so nice
to see them in my world,
and being able to share that
world with them was so cool.
And I don't know, it's
just part of the process,
and it makes you stronger.
Alright guys, that is a wrap
on this makeup tutorial.
I hope you enjoyed it.
I feel like this is a really
great, like end of summer,
last hurrah makeup look.
Definitely rock this to just anywhere
where you wanna have a little
bit of fun and experiment.
If you would like me to
try another makeup look,
please write it in the
comments down below.
I would love to try and tackle that.
And thank you so much for watching.
I hope I've been helpful,
or I've entertained you
in some way. (laughs)
Thank you, and I'll see
you guys in the next one.
Bye!
Mwah.
