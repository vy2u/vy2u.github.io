- Hey everyone!
It's your girl Jenn and today
I'm doing a really chill
get ready with me.
It's actually been quite a ordeal
to just be sitting down and
doing this vid tutorial.
Like I've been trying
to do this for so long,
like a good week,
but it's been one thing after another.
But we're here and
that's all that matters.
So yeah,
here I am with a clean moisturized face.
And I'm going to start with
sunscreen slash primer.
It's pretty cloudy today but
I'm still gonna apply this
because apparently the UV
rays can still seep out
from the clouds,
which is kinda frightening.
So I'm using this sunscreen by Supergoop.
This is their Unseen Sunscreen
and this is actually in
my REVOLVE Festival Box.
I picked this out for my box
because it's the first time
I've ever seen a sunscreen
where it looks like this texture
and it acts as such a great primer
because it just smooths out the face.
Now I'm gonna move
straight into foundation.
This is Etude House's
Double Lasting Foundation.
I'm in the shade Honey Almond.
I actually went to Singapore
a couple weeks ago now with Ben,
and we had such a wonderful time there.
It was my third time visiting there
but it was Ben's very first time.
So I love when that happens,
because when you take your loved ones
to a place that you've already been to,
you can kind of show them around
and it makes you feel like
it's your first time going there again.
I wore this foundation the
entire time I was in Singapore.
And it just held up,
like the name is definitely
true to what it does.
Its purpose is fulfilled by its name.
It's super hot and humid in Singapore,
but my foundation was looking great.
For concealer I'm using
this one by Laura Mercier
I'm the shade 3W.
I'm just gonna pop this
just where it needs
a little extra help,
like my under eyes,
a little bit around the nose,
I mean I might just
put this on the bridge,
too.
I mean while we're here,
we might as well just do that.
A little bit on the chin.
When I was in Singapore
I ate so much food.
When I travel I just go ham.
Like I love eating so much,
I think more than the average person.
I definitely have a large appetite,
and in Singapore I did not hold back.
We're eating chili crab,
Chinese food,
like so .. all the different
types of desserts there.
It was so good.
Before I went to Coachella
I was really on the top
of my health game,
like I was going to the
gym every single day.
I was working out,
eating pretty clean,
but after Coachella I feel like
I think because I was working
so hard for my Coachella bod,
like after it was over,
I was like I'm just
gonna eat all the food.
And so I'm just trying to get
back on my health game again.
Because after Singapore I went to ..
or before Singapore I went to
Cabo for Emily's bachelerotte.
So we definitely drank and ate there.
My body type is the type where
if I eat like indulgently,
I do gain weight.
It's fast for me to gain weight,
but it's also fairly fast for
me to lose weight as well.
So that's good.
I'm not like a crash dieter.
I will always make sure
that things are gradual.
Like it's hard for me
to skip any meals too,
because like I said I love food
and like that is literally
one of the highlights
of my day.
Like if I'm having a bad day I'm like,
God at least I have dinner left.
I'm using this app called
Lifesum which helps
log your food and so you can
check your progress there.
Alright so now to set this I'm
using Patrick Starr's powder
with Mac.
I've been loving this.
It's been quite comparable
to Laura Mercier's
translucent powder.
I'm just gonna dust this
everywhere to set everything.
We're done with powder,
and now I'm gonna work on the brows.
I'm using this brow pencil by Hourglass.
I'm just gonna fill my brows into like
a nice straight shape
with like a baby arch.
So now that I have the general shape
I'm gonna get the spooly
and just start blending
that baby in.
Right now I'm gonna do kind
of like an electric blue
smokey eye.
I mean it obviously says
in the title down below,
but I've been loving
the look of just really
bright cobalt eyes.
And yesterday on my Eggie shoot,
I requested something really blue
and smokey and wet looking.
And it was done by my
man Daniel Chinchilla.
He's incredible and he did
such a freaking banging job,
and so,
I'm gonna try and combine my
technique with the techniques
I learned from him.
I'm gonna be playing with
Patrick Starr's palette by MAC.
Patrick's killing it
in the game right now,
and these colors that
he selected are amazing.
I like that they're really bold and fun.
I mean I'm gonna be playing
with a couple different palettes
but the main one is gonna be
this gorgeous cobalt blue.
First up,
I'm going to use Marc
Jacobs eyeliner pencil
in Out of the Blue.
I'm just gonna use this as
a base for my eyeshadow.
So I'm just gonna like be messy with it,
I'm gonna be a little haphazard,
but don't worry,
if everything goes smoothly,
it will blend out.
I really love the way Daniel
does my makeup as well.
Like he's so incredibly talented,
and like when he does my makeup I do feel
like I look different,
but in like a good way.
It's not like I look at myself,
I'm like Oh my gosh,
I'm unrecognizable.
Like for him,
it's just kinda like ooooh.
Like I feel like it's his
interpretation of my face.
I remember when I first
started to get my make up done,
like I hated what everyone did.
And it wasn't that they did a bad job,
it was just I wasn't used to
the way they did my makeup.
So even if the eyebrows
are shaped perfectly,
because it wasn't the way
that I did my eyebrows,
it looked wonky.
So I like that I've grown out of that
because its really opened
up the door for me to
just collaborate with more artists,
and it makes you more open minded
about the way you can look at yourself.
So now that the eyeliner's on,
I'm gonna go dip into this cobalt blue.
And just kinda go to town,
but I'm gonna make sure to dust off,
that's important,
because I don't want any fall out.
Wooooooo,
I'm gonna attempt to
try and wing this out,
but without the assistance of tape.
Before I would just use tape
and I would just peel it off.
But it would be a very sharp line,
which I like,
but since I've already done
that so much in the past,
like I want to try and start
practicing to like make it
smokey on my own.
It's looking a little rough,
but we're gonna go in
with the fluffy brush
and really try to blend this out.
So normally when I do any
smokey eye with color,
I always like to blend
it with like a brown;
but this time,
I'm gonna try and blend it
with a cool tone instead.
So this is Old Smoke
from the Urban Decay Distortion palette.
So I'm gonna get into this gray,
and then I'm gonna try my
best to blend this out.
Oh,
dear God,
please help me blend this out.
Oh God,
it's not the one folks.
This is what happens
when you don't plan out
your stuff guys.
Okay so don't use this.
Alright so I had a
little bit of emergency,
I had to like wipe some of it off.
It was just too much.
I didn't want to smoke it out that much.
So I went in and used Shag,
which is kinda like a
lighter metallic gray.
And I used that to kind of
blend it out more evenly.
So now I'm gonna attempt using Old Smoke
and using that just as my
darkest point of the eye.
Wish me luck.
Send me a prayer please.
Because the last one didn't go through.
Alright so now the top is blended.
I'm gonna go with Marc Jacobs pencil and
and just tightline my waterline.
First I'm gonna go in with
Shag and I'm gonna start
blending this on the bottom and
seeing what that looks like.
I think I'm just gonna
use Shag on the bottom,
it just looks a lot more
diffused out with this.
I'm gonna just wing it
out with this eyeliner
by EM Cosmetics and I'm gonna give myself
kinda like a mid wing.
It's not gonna be too dramatic,
but it's not gonna be too small either.
I'm looking at myself
through the viewfinder,
and it's so crazy how brown my eyes look
when they're compared with blue.
It's actually very becoming on brown eyes.
I feel like the blue got a
little lost in the blending,
so I'm gonna use Color Pop's Too Shy,
and I'm gonna use my ring finger,
and I'm just gonna pop that onto the ..
I guess just like the blue area of my eye,
and I'm gonna see where that takes me.
So the eye shadow is finally done.
I'm gonna move on to mascara.
I'm gonna do a light coat with Eyeco,
this is their Sport Waterproof mascara.
So yeah,
yesterday was the Eggie shoot
and I can't believe it's
already our summer drop.
This may be my favorite drop yet,
especially for the
concept and the campagin.
Vannga of Advnt Society
did such a great job
coming up with it and it
was so cool seeing the smoke
and the flowers and I love
the way Adam shoots as well,
like I feel really lucky
that I have surrounded myself
with a team that I love and trust.
Like I only work with people
that I have good chemistry with.
But I wanted to get your
guys honest feedback.
Because I'm going to
continue to promote my brand,
Eggie,
like this is my clothing line,
and if I'm not promoting it,
like who is?
So every drop that I make from Eggie,
I always like to do two videos.
One is like the cool
editorial lookbook video.
Then the other is like a
hall where I break down
each item by item.
So I want to ask you guys like
which one do you guys prefer?
Do you think two videos is
too much per collection?
Do you think it's good the way it is?
Do you think I should just
like do one or the other?
I just feel like I'm in a
tough position because I don't
want to feel like I'm constantly
just like shoving all these
Eggie stuff at you,
but it's hard for me
because I'm so excited
and I'm proud of it,
but I want to be able to respect
what you guys want to watch as well.
So yeah,
let me know what you guys think.
If you think I should
tone it down a little bit,
let me know.
If you guys think it's good the way it is,
I mean,
let me know too.
Now I am putting on false lashes.
These are by Velour.
I will just write what style
they are in the bottom,
because I have no idea.
I picked them out of the lash book,
but I can go back and look at the box.
So I feel like the lashes really
just opened everything up.
But I think I want a
little bit more glitter,
so I'm gonna use Urban Decay's Heavy Metal
Glitter Eyeliner in the color Spandex.
And this has like really
chunky glitter flecks in it,
so I'm just gonna whoa,
wow,
okay.
So I just like to concentrate
it like in a little area.
Something can't pop if
it's all over the place.
You've gotta choose
where you want it to pop.
Now to add some color to my cheeks,
I'm using Benefit's Dandelion.
This is just kind of like
a easy dusty pink color.
I'm gonna apply that right over here.
As for any wedding updates,
as you guys know,
I'm getting married in the summer.
I don't want to disclose what exact month
I'm gonna get married,
because just for like privacy reasons.
But I've decided that I
don't think I'm gonna do
a full wedding series
until after the wedding,
because I'm at a point where,
like,
wedding planning does stress me out.
And having to plan like a YouTube video
or YouTube videos
about it,
would just make me kind of even more..
It would overwhelm me even more.
I realize that I'm not the type of person
that gets super excited
about wedding planning,
and it's not that like me
and Ben have any issues;
it's more just logistically.
It's a lot of things that
I've never thought about.
Growing up I never fantasized
about my dream wedding.
I didn't think about what cake I wanted,
what dress,
what flowers,
what chargers to go on the table.
So it's been a lot of decisions making
where I just don't even
know where to start.
Like I've only been to
a handful of weddings.
It was just recently until
one of my best friends
got married.
So it was really cool,
and amazing,
getting to see her
beautiful day before mine.
Because it kind of put
everything together,
if that made sense.
I think those who have been married,
you guys kinda know
what I'm talking about.
But I think because I'm
like one of the first
of my friends to get married,
it's hard for me to plan something
that I've never done before.
So I think that's where a
lot of the anxiety comes in,
because I just don't
feel like I'm prepared.
I do have a Wedding Planner,
but it's not the experience
that I imagined it would be,
so yeah.
I mean I won't get into it,
but I'm .. just know
that I'm dealing with it,
like everything's great,
but I just don't feel comfortable
having a wedding series
until after my wedding.
Because after it's done then
I'll know exactly what I did,
and I can explain it to you guys.
For my highlighter,
I'm using this one by Persona,
this is in Zuma and this has been
one of my favorites to use;
definitely a tiny dent in it.
And I'm just gonna put
this onto the apples
of my cheeks,
and nose and cupids bow.
So I'm gonna finish up the look.
I'm using this really nude peachy shade
by Fenty Beauty.
It's called Up 2 No Good,
and I'm just gonna finish this off.
(lips quietly smacking)
Alright guys,
this is the finished look
and I absolutely love it.
I can't wait to rock
this summer or anytime
I want to feel more adventurous.
I know that this color looks intimidating,
but I swear you can pull
it off and with practice
it's gonna look freaking bomb.
And if you mess up,
anything is salvadgeable.
Like midway I was freaking out,
but it came together.
So yeah,
I hope you guys enjoyed this.
