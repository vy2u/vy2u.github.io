I have the space of the month
I have partnered with kanika and I'll be
using their beyond perfecting foundation
and concealer to show you guys how I got
this look it is glittery it is glamorous
and just perfect for any summer day or
night out I actually learned this makeup
technique from my girls Sofia so thank
you babe I learned so much about makeup
from her and she's amazing go check her
out if you haven't already I've also
picked out some questions to answer on
Instagram and Twitter so just come hang
out grab a snack get ready with me also
if you are not subscribed already button
is down there hit that join the family
let's get started
alright guys my face is cleansed its
moisturized and there's SPF on it so now
we're going to jump right into primer
I'm using this one by pony effect it is
her ultimate prep primer and while I
apply this onto my face I'll be
answering a question from Dafina she
asks when is the wedding as you guys
know I am in contact with the wedding
planner her name is Jeannie and I know
I'm in good hands with her so she said
our first step is to create a guest list
so a couple days ago open and I sat down
together and we went through over the
people we're going to invite and we want
like a relatively small / intimate
wedding so we want like 100 people max
so now that we have our list we're just
going to go back to Jeannie and we're
going to let her know and so she's going
to help us pick the perfect venue for
that amount of people ask for timing
we're thinking about sometime in 2018
you got to book these venues like months
in advance so ideally we would love to
do it in the summer but we are open to
the fall as well at all the times oh
we're doing our wedding in California so
the weather should be good either way
now I'm going to move on to foundation
I'm using my go-to one as of lately
which has been clinics beyond perfecting
foundation and concealer this is only
twenty eight bucks and I'm actually
going to use two shapes because I want
to use ones highlight and just one to
like be my natural skin tone
so I'm going to go in with women and I'm
going to use the DOS foot applicator and
I'm going to pop that right underneath
my eyes where I want to highlight
I love how precise you can be with this
applicator this kind of reminds me of
like shaped capes as I said before so
I'm going to work on blending this in
this is a medium to full coverage
foundations they can use as much or as
little as you want I'm going to a
wedding right after this so I want my
makeup to the bomb so now that we've
applied this layer I'm going to go in
with this shade buttermilk I'm just
doing a light layer because I still want
my skin to peek through I really love
the natural matte finish this has and it
lasts up to 12 hours so it's going to
stick on my face all day so now that
foundation and concealer are done I'm
going to set this all down with the
powder I'm using this one with pony
effect and I'm just going to grab this
like flat brush from Marc Jacobs and I'm
just going to Pat this on my face I
don't really bake anymore because I just
realized it kind of makes my skin look a
little patchy so I've been doing this
like pat-down method there you go have
you thought of any places for the
honeymoon what is your dream destination
for it
so bender I would love to go to
somewhere where we both haven't been so
maybe like to Mexico or even like an
island in Greece just somewhere warm and
someone we can just relax and joy to
this company oh we would even love to go
to New Zealand
there's just so many places that we
haven't been together so the options are
endless if you guys have any ideas for
where we should go to honeymoon feel
free to write it in the comments down
below so as you can see I'm just kind of
brushing away any of excess off and now
my faces now I'm going to move on to the
brows I'm using this brow styler if I'd
you're how did you know that Ben was the
one well that is a really really good
question with my previous relationships
the thought of marriage or the idea of
marriage was just very unsettling like I
I just honestly thought I was a skeptic
to marriage because it didn't seem like
something I could do like spend forever
with this person that sounded really
scary to me but then was different it's
also cliche but
I just genuinely didn't believe in the
idea of a soulmate until I I found him
and it wasn't like an overnight thing it
wasn't like right when I got together I
was like geez the one it definitely came
with time and I think as we kept on
spending time together and as we kept on
getting to know each other
I just realized like whoa I have never
been this compatible with the person
before like I'm a different person where
I like to to have relationships outside
of my my partner i time with my friend i
value time with my family and i value
time for my career and with Ben I know
that we both make each other better
people like we have been living together
for like a year or over a year and
things haven't things have never been
better because I feel like once you move
in with someone that's when all the
stuff kind of comes out and it really
tests your relationship but Ben and I
are very compatible and I'm so so
grateful for that the idea of starting a
future with them having kids it sounds
exciting and I know I just I I just know
that he's the one for me okay I think
that looks fine now the browser on I'm
going to get started with the eyeshadows
this is my favorite part I'm using Nyx's
jumbo eye pencil in dark brown and I am
just going to go to town on my lid I'm
going to apply it all over because this
is going to be a place for the eyeshadow
or the liquid eyeshadow that we're going
to be using and I'm just going to kind
of smooth out the edges a little bit so
they're not so harsh I know it looks
really uneven right now but we're going
to fix that in just a second but it is
time for the exciting part quick
glitters this is steel eyes liquid
eyeshadow in molted midnight and I'm
going to grab this little wand and I'm
going to precisely apply that right over
the dark brown bit damn look at that
look at that shimmer I'm going to go in
with my finger I'm just going to kind of
Pat that all out
do you ever want kids if so how many
I would love children in the future in a
perfect world I would have two kids I
would love to have like one of our own
like I would get pregnant once and then
I would love to adopt another one and
that would just be great because they
would always have each other and I know
Ben would be such an amazing dad and I
would try my best to be the best mother
I could be I would say that we are
pretty nurturing people so I would love
to kiss in the world that would be that
would be perfect now that the glitter is
on I'm going to really focus on blending
this guy out it looks like a hot mess
I'm going in with Kat Von D's monarch
eyeshadow palette I'm going to go in
with this dark brown shade right over
here I'm going to grab a little bit of
that tap off the excess and I'm going to
focus on blurring out the outdoorsters I
don't know about this this looks a
little crazy see if this helps Elle how
do you maintain such a cool a cheerful
attitude while being so busy how do you
manage social and work life with your
crate dead rules
I've definitely mentioned this before
but I am a crazy avid planner I love to
just schedule everything on my phone and
on my happiness planner if I don't do
that I don't know how I would keep up
with everything it just keeps me sane so
that's how I'm able to juggle my social
and our work life as per my attitude
it absolutely fluctuates I'm not always
happy and cheerful I know a lot of you
guys are under the impression that I'm
like constantly happy but I have my like
I have deep mood swings and I don't
think I've ever mentioned that but my
highs are like soaring high like I feel
so happy when I'm happy but when I'm
feeling down sometimes I can get into a
very very dark dark place and the last
thing I need when I'm in that dark state
is to record that and have more
judgements and opinions about me because
I'm a very sensitive person and when I
met my darkest points in my life I just
I don't really feel like documenting
that and I think that's fair I know some
people see it as an outlet and they like
to connect with their audience that way
but for me when I'm feeling down I just
I just need to be alone and be around
people that understand the full context
of my situation and I think that's fair
I don't think that's being fake I don't
think that's being inauthentic I think
it's just being more particular on what
you choose to share to the online world
and then I'm going to go in with that
same
taupey color right over here and I'm
going to just put that all over my under
eyes okay I'm going to go in one more
time with this glitter it's like the
last hurrah of shimmer because I think
some of it got lost as I was blending
out now for my inner corners I'm going
to go in with color pops summer loving
I'm going to just pop that into the
inner corners of my eye and this is just
going to brighten everything up and add
even more glitter all right very happy
with the way that looks so now I'm going
to give myself a classic cat eye using
cap on D's tattoo liner and I'm not
going to speak while doing this because
there's no way in hell I can talk and do
a straight cat eyes so I'm going to go
quiet for a second pretty severe wing
but I think we're fine I think what I'll
do is I'll just smoke it out underneath
a little bit more so it just kind of
goes with the tail a little better now
I'm going to get started on the lashes
I'm going to go in with the Shiseido
flash mascara
what weird food combinations do you
really enjoy I have the habit of putting
kimchi on everything that always thinks
is really strange and I do it but I just
can't help the fact that I taste so good
like for example I love kimchi and
shepherd's pie that's all kimchi and
spaghetti that's delicious
so now that mascara is done I'm going to
go in with some falsies these are by
velour so now that my lashes are intact
I'm going to contour I'm using this
palette from lorac I'm going to go in
with the light contour and then I'm just
going to start giving myself some
cheekbones oh wow that is very dark that
is that is too dark okay how do I fix
this
oh my gosh oh God the beauty blender
saves everything okay okay
whoo so fYI life contour isn't so light
with the lowest palate okay so I do the
other side I'm gonna answer this
question I this is from Monica she asks
what should you do if you're feeling
lost with your life
coughs asking for a friend coughs the
last time I felt the most lost in my
life was when I was in Community College
I got rejected to all my dream schools
I was stuck living at home with my
parents and that was actually when I
started my youtube channel with Sarah I
used all my feeling of aches and
discouragement and just feeling lost
into a creative outlet and I found I
found myself because of that so I think
if you're feeling lost you just got to
do things that make you more self-aware
you got to learn about yourself a little
bit more so whether it's journaling or
filming or creating art something in
that field that's going to make you just
get to know yourself a little better you
will find a meaning if you seek you will
find for blush I'm using this one by
hourglass this is my first time using it
it looks very very beautiful looks like
the world this blush is very pigmented
as you guys can tell I'm gonna go in
with the Beauty Blender and hopefully
this fixes this as well so the moral of
the story is your Beauty Blender can
literally fix anything all your your
makeup mistakes so blush is done and now
we're going to highlight I'm using this
one by Dior this is their your skin nude
and Luminizer everyone is going bonkers
over this highlighter so I'm excited to
try it out haha Wow I like I like a lot
oh yeah do you like being called Korean
or American I consider myself a Korean
American because even though I'm 100%
Korean by blood I was born and raised in
Los Angeles the strange thing is that
I'm considered a foreigner by both sides
in America I'm considered a foreigner
because I'm Korean and when I go back to
Korea they see me as a foreigner because
I was born in America so it's a very
interesting position korean-american
any like minority has when they are born
in America and luckily I am happy with
who I am and I have like a community of
people who who are in the same boat as
me so I never feel alone it's just
interesting the last step is lipstick
I'm using colourpop's screenshot this is
kind of just like a good news I love
color pop all right everyone that this
is the finished look I think this is
perfect for any summer days or nights
out any time you just want to feel a
little extra glam I'm actually heading
to a wedding after this so I think this
makeup is going to be for that if you

am going to be filming more makeup

shadow look so I have not forgotten
about that
