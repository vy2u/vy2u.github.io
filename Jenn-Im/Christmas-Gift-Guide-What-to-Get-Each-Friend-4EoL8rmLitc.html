Happy Holidays
today I have whipped up a little gift
guide on what to get each type of friend
because I know this time of year can get
a little bit stressful so here I am to
give you some ideas so let's get started
so the first type of friend I'll be
talking about is your very organised
friend or that friend that needs to get
their together so my first idea is
going to be a planner this one is by
happiness planner and look at this cover
it is so gorgeous it is in this
beautiful black leather case with a rose
gold lining right over here and when you
open it you write what makes you happy
what makes you unhappy your strengths
weaknesses all that stuff it's just
basically assessing you on how you feel
at the beginning of the year so this
goes beyond just planning and organizing
your day it makes you reflect on stuff
that makes you happy too so it's a bit
of a diary and a planner all-in-one and
I'm so excited to use mine next up I
have this book by Dale Carnegie it's
called how to win friends and influence
people and this is one self-help book
that I urge everyone to read because
let's face it communication is key and
every day a lot of people struggle with
it we have to deal with a lot of
personalities and this book gives you
solid advice on how to interact with
them after I read this book I felt that
I saw my relationships with people and
the way I interact with people in a
whole different light so I highly
recommend it also I feel like this is
the type of book that everyone needs on
their bookshelf my next gift idea is
called the I ring and I swear this has
changed my life it is basically a little
metal hook that you attach to the back
of your phone case and once you slip it
on you never drop your phone case look
it's fine it's it's on there for good so
this is going to be amazing for that
friend that always drops their phone and
shatters your screen after they have
this it's going to be secure and safe so
the second type of friend I'll be
tackling is the gym rat this is your
fitness crave friend that is always
hitting the gym is always taking those
gym snaps the progress picks all of that
so my first gift idea for them
is a good workout bag and this has been
my favorite workout bag of all time
first off there's this little
compartment here where you can put your
phone in and then in the main
compartment there are two little
sections the first one you can just you
know throw in your wallet or I don't
know a little protein bar and then in
the bigger one you can put your water
bottle you can put I don't know random
gym stuff like this your headphones
everything and just the way it slips on
is just so comfortable and I always feel
ready to hit the gym once I have this
bag next up I have the Camelback water
bottle I swear I feel like I'm always
trying to sell this to you guys I've
never stayed more hydrated it's my
favorite thing to even drink out of when
I'm not working out this has just
replaced all cups for me the reason why
this is so amazing is this little
mouthpiece here you don't need to tilt
the bottle you don't need to tilt your
head for the water to come gushing out I
love this guy it comes in so many
different colors camp you know I just
have to plug in my Camelback here so
these are a little bit on the pricier
side but I thought I should give my Bose
headphones a shout-out anyway because
these have changed the workout game for
me first off they are wireless so you
don't have to worry about the annoying
cords all you got to do is turn on your
Bluetooth and then they're connected we
go over the ears and they're very noise
canceling I love these guys and also the
bass on these are pretty phenomenal so
you can crank it up and it's go hours
for cardio not hours maybe like 40
minutes so the third type of friend I
have is the creative soul this is your
artsy friend that is constantly creating
something so first I have this this is
called the Instax share SPT printer and
it prints out any of your photos on your
phone as a Polaroid as much as I love my
Instax Polaroid camera it's pretty
annoying to carry around it's bulky it's
heavy and honestly there's not enough
room in my purse to carry it everywhere
but now with this you can make any old
memory into a vintage looking one next
up I have an adult coloring book I read
somewhere that coloring is supposed to
decrease the amount of stress levels on
your brain in that case I feel like I
should be spending a lot more time
coloring I found this one on Amazon and
I just thought this had really great
designs there's a lot of prints like
guarding the
signs mandalas animals and paisley
patterns and your friend can just kind
of relax and just unwind the mind by
coloring these books
it definitely taps into more of a
nostalgic part of my brain because it
reminds me of coloring books when you're
a kid if your friend paints you can't go
wrong with a set of cute cups I actually
got this set in Toronto it was across
the Drake Hotel I think it was called
the general store but I was obsessed
with these cups and I thought that if
your friend paints they can probably use
these cups to watercolor and whatnot or
they can drink tea or alcohol or
whatever kind of liquid they want inside
these cups the possibilities are endless
now it's time to talk about that friend
that loves fashion loves to keep up with
the trends and every fashionista loves
to accessorize so why not deck them out
in some cozy headwear this is a beanie
which is a no-brainer it's an essential
during the winter time and the fact that
it doesn't have any sizing is great
because I know with clothing you can get
a little bit tricky finding the right
size if you get them a large but they're
actually a medium they're just kind of
like you know you know feelings can get
kind of weird so with hats you don't
have to worry about size one size fits
all another accessory that I love
gifting is definitely a pattern scarf
this one is from Zara and it's just in a
neutral color that will go with
everything this is a great add-on gift
in case you're getting your friend just
a bunch of small gifts all together it's
something very thoughtful and every time
they wrap their neck they're gonna be
thinking of you and lastly you can't go
wrong with a little bit of timeless
jewelry and here's what I'm going to put
my little shameless plug in but I
actually came out with the collection
with Missouri and I'm so proud to say
that each one of these pieces in my
collection is something that a person
can wear every single day they're made
from precious metals so they're not
going to make your finger green and
they're perfect for layering I love each
piece from the collection and I think
they'd be a beautiful gift for someone
special lastly we've got the beauty
junkie that's the one friend that is
obsessed with all makeup and skincare so
my first idea for a stocking stuffer is
gonna be some face masks these are by
dr. jart which is a Korean brand and I
love their face masks so much because
they're very effective and they all
target something different for example
this one brightens this one minimizes
pores the list goes on
on this is something that can just stuff
in a stocking and just something that a
girl can put on when they want to pamper
themselves another great gift idea is
bite beauty's multi sticks these are a
great gift for the girl that loves
multi-functioning products so each one
of these sticks works in three ways you
can wear it as a lipstick and eyeshadow
and as a blush as you can see they come
in a medley of different colors but my
personal favorites are praline and
brioche I know Stephanie really likes
brioche too and looks beautiful on your
lips I really love the way that they
blend and they're really easy to work
with lastly every beauty junkie wants a
little bit of Kylie or at least they're
interested on what types about so here
is her holiday 2016 palette there are a
total of nine shades each one is very
pigmented very blendable he's got
shimmers and some mattes and I can
imagine so many different types of looks
you can create with this one palette
