- Hey everyone, it's your
girl, Jen, and today I have
a very special guest joining us today.
- A very special guest,
thank you very much.
- This is my fiance, Ben,
and today we are cooking
for y'all because that is one
of our favorite activities
to do together.
- It's true.
- We have partnered with Hello Fresh,
and Hello Fresh is such a cool concept
because they deliver
pre-measured ingredients
and simple chef made recipes
straight to your door,
and they come with three
plans you can choose from.
There is Classic, Veggie,
and Family, and we have
decided on Veggie because Ben
has been pescatarian for four?
- Three or four months.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, a little while, so
I'm very excited about this.
We got our package yesterday
and they come in these
nice little recycled
packages, it's lovely.
And we went for the yellow
squash flatbreads for this one,
which we haven't really made,
we've never made before.
- We've never made flatbread before, so...
- Or even yellow squash.
- Mm mmm.
- So I'm excited about this.
- So each one of the bags comes
with this lovely instruction
card and I love how thorough
it is, it tells you how
much time it takes, so 30
minutes, and when you flip
it over there are step by
step instructions on how to
prepare the food and it looks
pretty straight forward.
Alright, so let's attempt at cooking this!
- I love how they give you
the exact amount of food you
need as well 'cause we're
always going to the grocery
store and buying a lot
of food that, you know,
it's very easy to waste
food, we love cooking
and when you're trying to
go through recipe books
and it can be quite
overwhelming and there are so
many ingredients you don't
have and it just puts you off.
We go back to like, the
recipes we're used to making
and that can get quite boring.
You want to push yourself.
- So when did you start cooking?
- I've always loved cooking.
When I was younger I
would just throw different
stuff in, just for, I didn't
know what I was doing.
- That's the phase I'm in right now.
(laughter)
I literally just throw
anything in a pot together.
Like, all my favorite things
I'll just put in a pot
and be like,
- Yeah.
- expect it to taste good.
- We've got a good system,
like, when it comes to cooking,
you love prepping, I love cooking.
- I do love prepping because
it's just very therapeutic.
Like even all this, look at
this beautiful pile of squash.
- Look at that, this is lovely, Jen.
So the next thing we
need to do is pine nuts.
And I don't know, if you
haven't made pine nuts,
or cooked pine nuts before
they are absolutely delicious.
I'm gonna start frying these now.
- Ben is actually gonna do
step two and three altogether.
He's gonna toast the pine nuts
until they're golden brown,
and then he's gonna get the
scallions and the squash
and he's gonna put them on the same pan
over medium high heat.
- So the scallions and
squash are done, they've been
fried up, they're smelling good.
What is next?
- Alright so now we're
gonna bake the flatbread.
So this is the finished
squash and scallion mixture.
I'm gonna get the mozzarella,
and I'm gonna tear it
into small pieces with our hands
and scatter it all over the flatbread.
Then we're gonna top
with the squash mixture,
and then we're gonna put it in the oven
until they're golden brown.
So while the flatbread's
cooking we're gonna
work on the salad.
We're just gonna get the lettuce mixture,
put it on a bowl, drizzle
some lemon and olive oil,
and call it a day.
- So the salad is done, I
think everything's pretty
much good to go.
- Mm mmm.
- Our allocated ten minutes are up,
so should we see if the
flatbreads are done?
- Let's do it.
- Looking good.
- That looks so delicious. Holy cow!
- Wow!
- And the final step is to
dress it with the basil,
pine nuts, chili flakes, and honey.
- And also, for 30 dollars
off your first week
of Hello Fresh, visit
hellofresh.com and enter clothes30.
- Okay, so this is the finished
meal, let's give it a go.
- Cheers, babe.
- Cheers!
- Enjoy.
- Mmmmm.
- Mmmm.
- Mmmmm, that's really good
- It's so good.
- The honey works, doesn't it?
- Exactly. I was a little
worried about the honey,
but it goes so beautifully with this.
- It's delicious, it's very light as well,
we should do this more often.
- Oh man.
- Jen loves the chili flakes.
- I do. Even though
they give me heartburn.
- Yeah, you always regret
it. You always regret it.
- I know, it's worth it.
- It's worth it at the time.
What I love about this is we go away a lot
and you can put your account
on hold when you go away
which is really useful
because obviously to try
and buy groceries, you've
got to go away and come back,
it's just hard to figure it out, you know?
- Mm mmm.
- So this is, that's very handy.
That's definitely something
that we're really stoked about.
- This is so good.
Okay so I just slammed down my serving,
but I'm so happy that we got to do this.
- Mm mmm.
- It's just so much fun.
