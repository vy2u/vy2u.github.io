- Hi everyone!
It's your girl Jenn, and I am
back with a fashion video.
I have always been a woman on the go,
I just like to keep busy,
and sometimes my day is booked up
from the morning to the night,
and so I thought it would be
a really great opportunity
to show you guys how I
keep my outfits poppin'
no matter what hour it is.
So, I got three closet
essentials that I wanted to show
how I transition from day
to the night, so, yeah!
Let's get started with
the outfit transitions.
So the first essential
I'll be talking about
is an everyday cardigan.
This one over here is from
my clothing line Eggie
and it's definitely one
of my favorite pieces
in the collection, because
of its versatility.
I really love the color,
it's in this really fresh salmon shade
and it's kind of like a blushing nude.
So here's how I style
this outfit for the day.
I've just gone for a really
casual, everyday look.
I paired it with this comfy striped top,
and then I tucked it
into some white mom jeans
and I think it gives it a
really nice relaxed feel.
I really like this silhouette, because
it's really practical and very forgiving.
For shoes, I wore some sneakers.
These are from Adidas, and
then I added a white belt
to just cinch the look.
This is aa really great look for school
because of how comfortable it is.
I definitely would have worn
this to class in college.
Now this is how I transform
the look into something
more suitable for the evening.
I switched out the light denim
for some black wax bottoms.
I decided to keep the striped top,
but I added a knot, just so I can show
how high-waisted the bottoms are,
and then I added a beanie from Team Cozy,
because I just wanted to stay
a little bit warmer for the evening.
For shoes, I stepped into these
studded flats from Azalea,
and I think this look would be perfect
for a dinner with the girls
or even going into a dive bar.
Basically, a casual evening look.
Now I'm going to move on to
the second closet essential.
You've gotta have a white
blouse in your closet.
This one is also from my line.
This one's a little bit more daring
because of the plunging neckline,
but honestly, as long as you have
like a crisp white button-down,
all the tips I'm going to
give you are gonna apply.
For the daytime, I styled the blouse
with these two-tone panel jeans.
These are from Grlfrnd and
they're just a killer fit.
This is made from that hard raw denim,
so it just really sucks you in.
The slits on the bottom make it easier
to show off your shoes.
I decided to rock these strappy nude heels
to elevate the look.
For accessories, I wore my
nameplate that I never take off,
and some hooped earrings from Adornmonde.
This is an outfit that
I'd wear to a meeting,
or somewhere where I want to look
a little bit more put together.
I know, this is showing some skin,
but I think because I work
in a creative industry,
it's fine, and it's acceptable.
Now let's switch it on
over to the night side.
First, I wrap the top in a different way.
Instead of a knot in the front,
I just made one in the back,
and now it looks like a new top.
I added a moto jacket
to toughen up the look,
and it also adds another layer,
since it'll be colder.
I accessorized with this baker boy cap,
just in case my hair got
greasy throughout the day.
I also added these silver
hoops in a cooler tone.
They coordinate really well with my heels,
and this is just a great edgy look
that you can rock to a fun party.
For my third and last closet essential,
I have a statement coat.
This one is in this
really fun gingham print,
but I love the fact that it's a blazer,
because this is such
a universal silhouette
for so many settings.
So this is my daytime look.
I went for something that looks
a little bit more equestrian.
I wore the blazer with a
black cropped long-sleeve.
It's ribbed, and it just
matches with everything.
I decided to go for a denim skirt,
because blue denim just looks
really fresh during the day,
and it just brightens this
whole dark palette up.
For shoes, I wore these black slingbacks,
and then I topped the look
off with this wool cap.
I love how put-together this look is,
but it's still casual, because we've added
the denim and the hat combo.
I think this is a really great outfit
for just going to brunch or
just a day out in the city.
Now I'm going to show you
how I rock this baby in the evening.
First, I got rid of the skirt,
and I just button the blazer into a dress.
I love that this coat is
long enough to do that,
and if you're just wanting
to show your figure more,
you can easily throw on a belt
and you'll regain your shape.
I added some thigh-high
socks for some warmth,
and I just streamlined them
with some black booties.
The finishing touches are
in my black leather beret,
and a statement lip, and now you're ready
to take the evening by storm.
All right guys, that is
a wrap on this Lookbook.
I hope you enjoyed it.
I actually had a really fun
time styling these pieces,
and thinking of multiple
like clothing combinations.
You really get a lot of
wear out of a lot of stuff
in your wardrobe, but I feel like,
you just gotta challenge
your mind a little bit more
and think of all the
options you possibly can.
Also, I enjoyed this
because we filmed this
with a C-stand in the living room.
Most of the times, with Lookbooks,
we're just kind of like
driving around in the street
and I'm like changing in my car,
and it's just uncomfortable.
So I really like this
new setup that we have.
Please let me know what
kind of styling videos
you'd like to see next in
the comments down below.
Also tell mem what was
your favorite outfit.
I love to hear you guys's feedback,
and seeing what you guys like.
I want to thank you guys
so much for watching,
and I'll see you guys in the next one.
Bye, mwah!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
