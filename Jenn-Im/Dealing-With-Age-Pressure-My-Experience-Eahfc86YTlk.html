- Hey everyone, it's
your girl Jenn and today,
I wanted to film a really
chill heart to heart
about the topic of age pressure.
It's something that I
really struggled with
and I know I'm not alone
because every culture
has societal expectations they put on us.
Like, we need to be at a certain place
when we reach a specific age.
For example, there are
some parts of the world
where a woman is actually
considered expired
if they're not married by the age of 30
and that just bewilders me, it's insane
and I'm so happy that
I've partnered with SK2
to talk about this subject.
So I recently saw SK2's
video called The Expiry Date
and I found it really
moving because it really hit
all the societal expectations
and norms they put on women,
whether it's finding a boyfriend on time,
having a baby at a certain age
and it made me really reflect
on all of the times I felt
pressured to make huge decisions
in my life just because
I reached a certain age.
One of the earliest signs of age pressure
was when I turned 18.
18 is the age where
you're an official adult
and you're supposed to be,
you know, going to college,
you're supposed to have moved
out of your parents' place
but I was in community college.
I didn't get accepted to any
of the schools I wanted to
and so I felt like I was at this deficit
trying to catch up with everybody
and it was very panicky.
I was able to find a creative outlet,
which was creating YouTube
videos so me and Sarah
started our YouTube
channel, Clothes Encounters,
and it felt so good to have this release
where we would just get
together every weekend,
film videos about our
fashion and lifestyle
and it was great and
honestly, it was truly
my light at that weird time in my life
and so I just continued to swing both
and then I transferred.
I transferred to UC Davis
and when I finally got in
to that school, I felt this big release.
I felt like I was finally on track.
I was good for two years
until it was about time
to graduate.
My parents started asking
me, &quot;Oh, like, Jenny,
do you, like, are you gonna
apply for jobs up there
or down there, are you gonna stop doing
your YouTube channel?&quot;
And I, honestly, didn't
know whether I wanted
to go the traditional
route or the riskier route.
I went with my gut because
I just knew YouTube
made me so happy and if I was gonna fail
at doing something I loved,
I would rather do that
so I went with YouTube and, honestly,
22 to 24 was a very
bright time in my life.
I felt strong, I felt independent,
I was living in Oakland
and it just felt amazing.
So fast forward to when I turned 25,
I was back in Los Angeles and suddenly,
I had my quote, unquote,
quarter life crisis
and it happened because
my manager and my agent
started to ask me more
questions about where my channel
was going or what I would
turn my business into
and I felt this pressure
to figure out everything
all over again and so
the Virgo in me started
to plan maniacally.
I created this very
extensive five year plan
of all these goals I wanted to hit,
like I wanted to buy a
house, I wanted to have
a retirement plan, I wanted
to retire my parents,
I wanted to have my
channel at a certain place
and it just felt like so much pressure
and, for me, a lot of my
pressures came from my career
and for every woman it's different, like,
I saw this Vanity Fair
interview where they interviewed
four amazing women in the digital space,
including my girl, Aimee
Song, and they all explained
different pressures that
they were faced with.
So for some of them, it was to get married
at a certain age, it was to
have children at a certain age
or to have their business
sold at a certain age
and so for every person it's different
but those pressures are still there.
I felt like I had to make it
by the time I was 30 on YouTube
because I was terrified
that the older I got,
the more irrelevant I
would become on YouTube
and when it was, like, 2015,
2016, there was this flux
of all these young YouTubers
and it was the first time
where I was like, whoa,
like, I am getting older.
I just felt so insecure
and unhappy with myself
and my channel because
I feel like my channel
and myself, they really bleed in together
and so if one is not
doing well, then I'm not,
and maybe on the outside,
it seemed like everything
was fine when I was 26 but it was a lot of
instability and unhappiness with myself.
Comparison is truly the
thief of joy and I know
with social media these
days, it's so pervasive
and everything's always in your
face and you just can't help
to compare your life with someone else's
but that's when I knew I
had to stop this delusion
because everybody's journey
is completely different.
Just because one person has
done this at a certain age
doesn't mean that you have to.
We're all on our own paths
and I knew I had to change,
I knew on my 27th birthday,
I had to just get it together
because it was not okay.
I started to distance
myself from my channel,
like, it's still my baby and I love it
but if my channel isn't doing
hot, it doesn't affect me
like it used to and I'm so
glad that I'm taking care
of myself better,
mentally, and I'm in a lot,
I'm in, like, such a
great place right now.
I am 27 years old and I
am proud of where I am
and I'm proud of where I'm going.
I feel like every year of my 20's has been
so radically different and
I'm so proud of this evolution
and I just know that
comparing is a game where
you will always lose.
If I could go back to my
younger self, I would tell her
to be present and to enjoy
life the way it exactly is then
because it will never ever
be like that ever again
so enjoy it and stop focusing
on where you constantly need
to be because you're gonna
be where you're gonna be.
My age is only a tiny tiny facet of me,
it does not define who I am
and I absolutely do not have
an expiry date until I
actually am dead in the coffin,
that is when I expire.
Not when I start getting
wrinkles, not if I don't hit
a certain age deadline, I am
here and I will live my life
on my own terms.
I would love for you guys to
see SK2's I Never Expire video.
I will leave a link in the description box
and also the card so
please, please go watch it,
it is so inspiring and I
hope it allows you to realize
that you can live your
life on your own schedule,
not somebody else's.
This is your life and
only you can control it.
I would love for the
comments section to be just,
like, a really supportive
place where we can listen
to each other and learn from each other.
I wanna thank you guys
so much for watching
and I'll see you guys in the next one.
Bye.
Muah.
