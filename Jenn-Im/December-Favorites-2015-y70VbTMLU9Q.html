we're gonna rewind back to December 2015
and I'm gonna chat about my favorites of
last month so let's get started
I love glitter and in December I wore a
lot of it especially with all the
holiday parties I was going to and my
favorite way to add clear to my I was
with Urban Decay's heavy metal glitter
eyeliner in the shade Midnight Cowboy
and my girl Sophia actually recommended
this to me so thank you it's awesome and
what I like about this island the most
is the application process it's very
precise it comes in this brush tip and
the glitter is on a gel so you can be
very meticulous with the application you
can put it exactly where you want it to
and because the gel hardens it doesn't
have any fallout so you don't have to
worry about having glitter all over your
cheeks and even in your eyeball and
cornea like that can get really
dangerous so with this eyeliner you can
be very careful with it and it just
stays put if you've seen my vlogs in
December then these glasses are no
surprise to you these are my brand new
prescription glasses from DITA and I am
just smitten with them they are just
really unique to me they've got this
gorgeous tortoise shell frame and
they've got a slight cat eye to it and
they're very lightweight and I didn't
think it was possible to love a pair of
glasses more than my old ones from
Oliver Peoples but unfortunately I
didn't do a good job taking care of them
like one day I just threw him in my bag
and he just got really scratched up and
when I went to LensCrafters to see if
they can put new lenses in them they
basically said that they would break so
I had to get a new pair of glasses and I
have no complaints with these ones from
Geeta they're gorgeous they're chic and
I can wear them even on days where I
don't feel like putting contacts in so
I'm gonna make sure I take really good
care of megiddo ones they're always
going to be in the case so they're gonna
be with me for years and years for those
who don't know I've logged every single
day last month in December and I put all
those clips in a series called jungle
bells so if you haven't seen that you
can click right here and you can check
it out
most of the clips that I filmed on those
logs were from I can't III I but on days
I didn't feel like carrying it I would
use a putting shoe instead and I ended
up getting the candy
g7x on I think like the second week of
December but I really loved using this
camera to vlog but the thing is it took
me a while to get this because I already
owned the Sony rx100 which is its direct
competitor and after using both of these
the differences are subtle but in the
end I preferred the canon g7x a little
bit more because of the monitor both of
the cameras monitors flip-up but this
monitor is touchscreen I also felt that
the lens on the g7x was slightly wider
than the Sony so I was able to capture a
little bit more of the background and
the footage I wanted a document and I
don't know I feel like the interface was
easier to use with this I feel like the
footage comes out a little bit more
creamy which is what I liked and yeah I
guess I will do a little clip on what it
looks like from the Canon all right so
this is what the canon g7x looks like I
mean check in the footage see what you
think that's what it looks like all in
all I would say that both of these
cameras are pretty much interchangeable
it just depends on preference and your
budget but in the end I like the g7x I
know a lot of other youtubers that use
this to vlog and they're happy and
satisfied with it too so if you're in
the market for a vlogging camera get the
g7x
so I wasn't sure if I was going to add
this movie favorite to this episode but
I thought what the hell
because during Christmas Ben and I saw
how to train your dragon' for the first
time it just came up on TV and we
thought what the hell because I feel
like any movie that DreamWorks or Pixar
does it's going to be decent and we
ended up loving it and we loved it so
much that we saw how to train a dragon
too right after and that movie made me
laugh and cry it was just like a lot of
ups and downs for me it's about a Viking
boy that befriends a dragon and he has
to change the entire towns mind about
what they feel about dragons so check it
out and also now I finally understand
why one of my friends named her dog
toothless like I met her dog toothless
like in the beginning of 2015 and I
never questioned where she got the name
or anything I just accepted
toothless for what she was but now I
totally get
it's from the movie and I feel kind of
stupid now for my music favorite I have
the album Troopa blue by cortex which is
a French jazz funk group from the 70s
and one of my closest friends brand
actually recommended this album to me so
thank you this album is incredible and I
just thought I would share it with you
guys as well it's the kind of music that
mellows you out but uplifts you at the
same time so it's really great music to
work with it's really great music to
drive with anything so if you're the
type of person that can concentrate
better with music going on I highly
recommend this album check it out and
when I first listen to it it almost
sounded familiar I ended up seeing this
short documentary called hunting for
rappers and it turns out that a ton of
rappers and hip-hop artists have sampled
Cortex's work and so that's why it
sounds so familiar because artists like
Rick Ross MF DOOM Tyler the Creator Wiz
Khalifa the list goes on but a lot of
them have sampled Cortex's work with and
without his authorization so you can see
this short doc to see like how he's
dealing with it all I'll leave the link
to the YouTube video and the album
because it's on YouTube as well so check
the description box we'll be there my
last favorite is none other than a hand
sanitizer I got this from Whole Foods
and I got this because it was a spray
instead of a gel I know a lot of
sanitizers come in like a liquid gel but
I just wanted to switch things up so
about the spray instead and I only use
this one I don't have access to soap and
water
I don't purely rely this to sanitize my
hands if there is a sink with some soap
I'm going to use that instead of this it
comes in a peppermint scent and it just
leaves my hands smelling really clean
and fresh and minty and yeah I thought I
would do a little shout out on it
because I've been using it so that
concludes my favourites for December and
I'm currently in the process of doing
the best products of 2015 so stay tuned
for that video and before I left I
wanted to ask you if you had any video
requests what do you want to see in 2016
please write it in the comments down
below it would really help me out
because I
I'm just currently trying to think of
you know fun and creative ways to put
new content on my channel and for you
guys to enjoy obviously as always thank
you for watching and I'll see you the
next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
