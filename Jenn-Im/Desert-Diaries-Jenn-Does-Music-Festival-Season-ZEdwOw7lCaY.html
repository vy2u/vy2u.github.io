- [Jenn] Good Morning!
For breakfast we've got
the avocado and toast,
breakfast taco's,
and a beautiful acai bowl.
- [Ben] I don't wanna move
the bowl, it looks so full.
- [Jenn] I know.
- Good morning guys.
- The aftermath.
Of yesterday.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Well we're here!
- We're out in Palm Springs.
- Mm hmm.
- So excited for the
festival this weekend.
Last night it was pretty
much just us settling in.
We're staying at the V Hotel,
but Revolve has pretty much
rented the entire thing out.
- It's crazy,
they've rented the whole hotel,
which is crazy.
But it's so nice to see so many people,
because as you guys know we get to go on
a lot of these kind of Revolve trips,
so every single person that has ever been
on a Revolve trip is basically here.
- Yeah.
Yesterday we just had
welcome drinks at the pool
and it was awesome.
Like Ben said,
We've been with Revolve
for a couple of years now,
so we've accumulated
a lot of friends here.
So, so many familiar faces.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- But I'm so, I'm like
freaking out because
there are a lot of my favorite
Youtuber's here as well
like Sammi Maria.
- Oh I saw her, yeah.
Yes and then Patricia, Tasha Green.
- So today is starting off slow.
Get some photos done.
- Mhm.
- We've got a pool party here
at the hotel which is nice.
- Mhm. For Shay Mitchell.
- Yeah.
- And then, going to a Foray party
and then head over to the festival.
- Yeah excited, it's gonna be a good day.

You can really see the crystals
in full force right now.
- [Stephanie] I know. The light.

and use Supergoop always coming through
but I love this spray it just
literally goes on like this,
like mist, and then you
rub that baby right in.
