and I thought I would do a haul
dedicated to this very specific time of
the year I'm gonna start off with shoes
because shoes are I think my most
favorite part of any outfit I realized
that I don't really have that many
sneakers in my shoe collection the only
pair of tennis shoes I have are the
running ones I have and I thought I
would add some converse to the mix and
these are my very very first ones I've
ever owned in my entire life I'm really
excited to get them all rough and dirty
because something about super clean
converse just makes me feel a little bit
unsettled so these are just gonna look
amazing with time and as they get more
rugged
I love platforms I added some nude ones
to my collection they look like they
would be really heavy because they have
this wood detailing on the side but it's
completely fake it's made of this fluffy
styrofoam material obviously it's not
styrofoam something more substantial
than that but it feels a bit squishy and
these have been my go-to shoes as of
lately because I have way too many boots
and I didn't want to be a victim of boot
tan and so these are helping me keep my
feet the same color as my legs thinking
of boots I got some white ones and I
think these are a nice change of pace
then all the black ones I have these are
a gorgeous ivory color and they've got a
cutout on the heel so you can flash some
foot blush if you'd like and the heels
are super interesting they're set in a
diagonal way and they're just quite
interesting to look at I picked out
these heels because they remind me of
those really sexy Valentino ones I
thought these would be a really cool way
to make just an edgy statement because
of the studs yet there's still quite
playful and feminine because of the pale
pink color as you can see I really like
pale pink
moving on to accessories I'm holding
this clutch it's seafoam and it has a
bunch of beautiful little cutouts on the
end if you have a phobia with pooris
things this clutch isn't for you but if
you have no problem with it I think
we're good this is essentially just a
clutch so you just stuff under armpit
and hope that you don't lose it
the night my next item are these pair of
earrings it's a wolf howling at
something and also these triangles that
have a turquoise stone just smack dab in
the middle of it realistically no one's
probably gonna notice them until you
point out Oh wearing studs or if you
wear a ponytail I just thought they were
cute because it's the little things in
life that just kind of bring up your day
all right so let's move on to some
summer tops I think floral crop tops are
a summer essential they're just really
easy to just chuck on when you're just
feeling like crap and this one is quite
a boxy fit this one is by Mattel and it
is a dark floral which I love because it
works year-round
you can pair it with dark colors for the
winter and fall and then you can pair it
with some white denim shorts for the
warmer months
I think lattice details are a great way
to add some mystery and sexiness to your
wardrobe
I think the intricate webbing on the
chest creates kind of a dominatrix feel
to it but since it's white it really
really tones it down if you're really
into nature inspired things but you're
sick of floral why not try the clouds in
the sky I picked out this gray cloud top
because it's black and white and this
one also has a really boxy fit attempt
it took off the sleeves again and I'm
probably gonna do that after I film this
I got this sweater because sometimes it
gets cold at night actually it's always
cold at night and this one's crop which
is amazing because it looks great with
highways things and here's the twist the
back is completely in this basket woven
texture it's just something really nice
to wear especially if you want to wear
this during the day because the little
holes provide some ventilation for your
back this is another top that's ideal
for summer nights it's a mishmash of
feminine and edgy the feminine miss
comes from the beautiful chiffon
material it's a very flowy and girly and
then the edginess comes from the
pleather lining that's all around the
collar and the sleeves I loved watching
today moon as a kid and collecting
paraphernalia like most Asian girls so
when I saw this shirt I was like dude
it's free
and Luna on a crop top made out of this
really stretchy soft material and then I
bought two other crop tops which are
exactly the same this is a white one and
this is a striped one I just had to
stock up on basics and so far I really
like the quality of brandy Melville's
tops especially for what I'm paying for
they're just really stretchy and stuff
that you want to wear when you're super
lazy and just want something soft on
your skin if you watch Anna Lee from
Anna Lee and Jesse on YouTube I know
that she has a million of these and I
know she can vouch for them as well them
then I briefly made a visit to the store
over the weekend at the thrift store
outlet and I just left with this flannel
I'm extremely extremely picky with
flannel I prefer funnel that's more of a
faded demure color and I like the plaid
to be kind of just a little bit random
this is going to be really great to just
layer over things like a white basic tee
or like a band shirt or something next
top might be controversial to some I
love this thing and I'm going to
continue to wear it it's Eunice as if
top and it is this white sheer top that
comes with a black bra let that's
married of this really soft vegan
leather
I think this top is something that share
from clueless of wear with absolutely no
shame and that's exactly how I'm going
to wear it too all right um rented
hangers so this little cardigan is just
something to throw over just chilly
summer nights it's this nice gray fitted
cardigan with patches of yellow and teal
and darker shades of grey it's slightly
peculiar and I think that's why I like
it okay
this jacket this jacket is just
everything I like because first off I've
been loving sportswear and it's in a
varsity jacket silhouette second it's
buttery soft leather and so when you
accidentally rub your hands on the
sleeve you just can't help but be like
this is so soft third there's a hood
attached to it and if you live in the
Bay I think you guys know that it gets
freakin cold and so when you throw up
the hood and get to keep your ears warm
it's definitely a plus shall we move on
to bottoms I think we should my first
pair of shorts are these high-waisted
ones that are cream
have this gorgeous delicate lace lining
on the bottom and keep in mind these are
very short these are short shorts I
think these are going to be perfect for
those sweltering hot summer days where
you're really tempted to just walk out
in your bare skin with a mist bottle if
you're looking for a statement pant that
catches your eye and your ears I think
these are the pants for you these are
the evil twin rivet pants and they're
high-waisted they're decked out in studs
and I think it's important to kind of
appreciate the craftsmanship that went
along making this because dude there's
even studying on the but then my haul
with something a little bit more modest
I'm going to be talking about scores and
scores are basically if a skirt and a
pair of shorts just had a baby I have
these angular sports from chien side and
these are extremely flattering because
the little flaps hide the biggest part
of your thigh so it just gives you the
illusion of really shapely little legs
all right so that was my haul feel free

okay all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
