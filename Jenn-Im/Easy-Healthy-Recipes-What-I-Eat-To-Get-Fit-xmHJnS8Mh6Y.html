- Hey everyone, it's your girl, Jenn,
and today, I am so excited
to bring you guys to my kitchen.
I have partnered with
Lifesum to show you guys
some recipes you guys can use and cook
at home to get fit for the summer.
So I've been using this app, Lifesum,
for around a month now
and I've been loving it
because it has so many recipes.
It's basically like having a
nutritionist in your pocket.
It's way more than just calorie counting
because it breaks down
the things that you eat
and you can just be more educated
on nutrition, which I love.
You can track how active you've been,
you can log in how much
water you've been drinking
and it gives you access
to personalized feedback
and I love that, I love when something
is keeping me accountable.
This app has lots of eating
plans that you can choose from
so you can see which eating
plan is the best for you
and today, I'm gonna be sharing
three of my favorite recipes
that I've been loving to cook, breakfast,
lunch and dinner, so let's get started.
So let's start with breakfast first.
Today, I'll be making the
ultimate green smoothie bowl
and I'm gonna list all the ingredients
you're gonna need in the description box.
First, pour one cup of
unsweetened almond milk
into a blender, then I'm gonna grab
a small avocado that's
been frozen overnight,
this is gonna give the
bowl some nice texture.
I'm gonna add one frozen
banana into the blender
and this is optional, but I'm gonna add
a cup of protein powder for my muscles
and then I'm gonna add three fistfuls
of spinach to finish it off.
So I'm just gonna blend
it until it's smooth
and I'm gonna serve it into a nice bowl.
For presentation, I'm
gonna add some blueberries.
These are jam packed with antioxidants
and they're tasty and they're
really great for your skin.
I'm gonna sprinkle on some coconut flakes
to add some sweetness and
then I'm gonna top it off
with some raspberries for a little kick
and there we have it, a
delicious easy breakfast
that literally took minutes to make.
(gentle music)
Let's move on over to lunch now.
I'm gonna be making a delicious
shrimp and avocado salad.
In a small bowl, mix together
the white wine vinegar
and chop up some parsley
and then I'm gonna make sure
to season with black pepper
and salt and a pinch of sugar.
I'm gonna mix it and then set it aside.
I'm gonna grab a zucchini
and I'm just gonna start choppin' that up.
You can chop it whatever
size or shape you want
but I decided with this shape,
I like things bite-sized.
Then, grab a red onion and
chop it into little bits.
You don't need too much of this red onion
because it's very potent.
It's time for garlic and
I'm using three cloves.
I'm just gonna smash it, peel it
and then chop it as fine as I can.
Next up, grab some
heads of romaine lettuce
and chop that baby into
whatever size you want.
Personally, I like my lettuce
a little bit more fine
because it's just easier to
chew and pick up that way.
Grab an avocado and start
slicing it into thin sections
and set that aside because
we're gonna add that
when the dish is all finished.
So now let's get cookin'.
Grab your frying pan and
I'm using an olive oil spray
but feel free to use
whatever oil you'd like.
Fry the zucchini on medium heat
until they're golden brown on both sides.
This is only gonna take a few minutes
because zucchinis are
actually really quick to cook.
Season them with salt and
pepper and remove them
from the pan.
Now let's go straight into the shrimps.
I have added some oil and
I'm gonna throw in the shrimp
for around three minutes on each side.
I've added some garlic at the end
and I just fried that all for one minute
and, voila, you are done with the shrimp.
So now it's time to assemble everything.
I'm gonna toss the lettuce,
red onion, zucchini,
the shrimps and the avocado into the plate
and I am adding salt and
pepper for some flavoring.
This is one of the easiest
things to put together
and it looks gorgeous.
I drizzled some dressing on
top and there you have it.
A delicious, balanced lunch.
I can honestly eat this every single day
because it is so frickin' yummy.
So our last meal of the day is dinner
and we are making a stir fry.
First, you're gonna grab your firm tofu
and then I'm just gonna drain it.
I am gonna lay my tofu
down on a paper towel
and I'm just gonna pat
it dry and just let it
stand there for ten minutes, like,
tofu has so much water and
it has to drain a little bit
so that way it's easier to cook.
Now, grab a small bowl
and combine the sugar,
miso paste and water
and just mix it all up
until it turns into, like, a watery paste.
I'm gonna grab some
asparagus and I'm gonna trim
the edges, I'm gonna chop it up like such
so it's in bite size pieces.
Then, I'm gonna trim my green beans
into the same shape and I
just love green beans so much,
they are my favorite
vegetable aside from broccoli
and so I'm just gonna get the asparagus
and green beans in a bowl and I'm gonna
just visit them later.
Then you're gonna need a shallot.
You're gonna peel it and start
chopping it really finely.
The tofu should be ready by now.
I'm gonna cut it into bite size cubes
and I love cutting tofu
because it is so satisfying,
it's just so soft and it just
does whatever you tell it to.
Then you're gonna need a spring onion.
I am using three stalks and I'm just gonna
chop that up finely.
And, lastly, if you're
into spice, grab a chili
and chop that up but make
sure you wash your hands
with soap after because
it is literally the worst
when you're working with
chilies and then you,
like, touch your eye, it's not ideal.
So now that everything's prepped,
you're gonna grab a
wok and on medium heat,
just drizzle some oil.
I am gonna throw in
the shallots, asparagus
and green beans until all
the vegetables are tender.
This should take around
five or seven minutes.
Just be careful that nothing
burns so keep stirring.
Once the veggies are
soft, you're gonna add
the tofu, the miso paste,
the green onion and the chili
and you're just gonna stir that up
until it's nice and piping hot.
While the stir fry is
workin', I am gonna grab
a small frying pan and I'm
just gonna cook myself an egg.
I've decided on a sunny side egg
because it looks really pretty
and so now that everything is cooked,
serve the stir fry on a plate
and then throw that little egg
on the side and, voila,
you are done with dinner.
This meal is so bomb and easy to make.
Honestly, the hardest part of this dish
is just the preparation
but after you finish that,
it is a breeze.
So those are all the recipes
that I have for you today.
I cannot wait to continue using Lifesum
to track my progress.
Hands down, my favorite thing
about the app is the recipe bank.
There is just access to so many healthy
and balanced recipes and I cannot wait
to continue cookin'.
I would love for you
guys to try out Lifesum
for yourself.
I will leave a link to the
app in the description box
so please go check it out.
It would be so cool if
we just all got to track
our progress and share our
journey with each other.
If you guys would like to
see more cooking videos,

and I wanna thank you
guys so much for watching
and I'll see you guys in the next one.
Bye.
Muah.
