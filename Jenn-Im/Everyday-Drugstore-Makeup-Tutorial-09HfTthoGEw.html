- Hey everyone, it's your girl, Jen,
and today I have a make-up video for you.
I am doing a, kind of like
an effortless glam look,
using all drugstore
products and I am so shocked
that this is my first time
doing a video like this
because this tag as been around for years,
and this has been on my
to-do list for years.
But 2018 is the year where
I'm just knocking everything
off that list, so if you'd like to see how
I did this look and
watch me answer questions
from Twitter, please keep watching.
So, first up, I always
wanna start with sunscreen,
I am an advocate of sunscreen because
I am terrified of wrinkles and the UV rays
and the best way to keep wrinkles at bay
is prevention and so
I'm using this sunscreen
by Olay, it is their Total Effects 7 in 1,
it's SPF 15 so it's a really
light, everyday sunscreen.
I love how absorbent it is and my skin
just really sits well with it.
So now I'm gonna move
straight into foundation,
I'm using this Wet 'n
Wild Cushion Foundation.
This is also SPF 15, so
I've got that extra coverage
and I am the shade nude beige.
I really like the coverage in this cushion
because I like how my
skin still peeks through,
but it's still really buildable.
So the first question is from Bianca
and she asks, &quot;Any tips
of staying organized
&quot;with the ridiculously busy lifestyle?&quot;
So I'd say the best way to stay organized
is to write everything you wanna do down.
So I still religiously
use my happiness planner,
like I use it every single day.
I don't know if you can see it,
but it's right over there, behind me.
I use that to a tee
and I write down everything I need to
because I know that my mind
is such a terrible office,
it literally forgets so many things
so the instant I have to do something,
I write it down or I'll
put it on my phone.
I'm also a huge advocate
of using the calendar app
on your phone, so, it
always gives me reminders
of things that I need to get done.
I want a little bit more
coverage underneath my eyes,
so I'm gonna use a holy grail of mine,
this is Maybelline's Instant Age Rewind.
I am in the shade medium and I'm just
gonna pop that underneath my eyes.
It's really important for me
to break down large projects,
so, for example, let's
say I have to upload
on the 23rd, I'll make
sure that on my calendar
I'll have a specific day
where I finish the treatment
and then I'll have a
specific day where I'll film
and then I'll have a specific day where
I'm finishing editing and then
I'll turn that into my editor
and she'll put in all the cool graphics
and the trimmings on it.
By breaking it down into
all these different days
it really helps me finish huge projects
and I don't feel like I'm overwhelmed.
If I don't do something
when I say I'm gonna do it,
it kind of ruins my entire schedule
and I don't know, I find
that planning really allows
me to do everything that I wanna do.
I think for some people,
they're afraid of planning
because they feel like it might constrain
or constrict their life, but I find that
to be the complete opposite.
The more I plan things,
whether it's like planning
to have a self-care day,
planning to have dates
with friends, planning on
having a full filming day,
I find that it frees
me up to do everything
that I truly wanna do on my list.
That is such a Virgo thing to say.
Alright, so the base
is looking really good,
I'm gonna seal that in with another one
of my favorites, this is
Rimmel Stay Matte Powder
and instead of using a brush,
I'm gonna use this little cushion guy
and I'm just gonna pack this all in.
I've noticed that when I pack it like this
I really don't stay oily and
it also keeps any wrinkles
from forming 'cause these days
I always have these smile lines
but when I do this
technique, I've noticed that
it doesn't show, it
doesn't crease as much.
So, I've been digging this.
So now I'm gonna work on my
brows, I'm using this product
by Joah, and it is their Brow Down To Me
in the shade taupe and this
is actually gonna be available
in CVS really soon so I'm so excited
for you guys to try it.
I'm just gonna do kind of
like a straight, gentle brow
with like a small arch.
So, I'm just gonna go for it.
(jazz music)
Alright guys, brows are finished
and now I'm gonna move
straight into the eyes,
I'm using this palette by Wet 'n Wild,
it is their Rose In The Air and I think
I'm gonna just go for
something quite natural.
I'm gonna go in with this
transition shade over here
and I'm just gonna pack
that onto my eyelid.
Ooh, it's pretty, I'm
gonna do the other side.
(jazz music)
So now that we have the
base, I'm gonna go in
with this orangy shade, right over here,
get in, get a fluffy brush
and I'm just gonna start
smoking that out, ooh.
(jazz music)
Oh, and by the way, I
feel like I never call out
my brushes, so I'm gonna do that today.
This is the Pro Blending Brush
by Sephora in the large 27.
But yeah, this is like
my go-to blending blush.
I find that whenever I make mistakes
this brush will usually save me.
And now I'm gonna get
a clean blending brush
and I'm just gonna smoke that even more.
This is the Sigma E 25 blending brush
and this has no product
on it, I'm just going
to smoke that out and
diffuse it even more.
We just want like a soft,
brown haze for this look.
I'm gonna intensify this a
little more, I pray to God
I don't ruin this, but I'm gonna
go in for like this darker brick red color
and I'm using this Urban Decay brush
that I got in one of the pallettes.
I'm just kind of poking it
where I would like it to be
and then using the other
side to kinda blend it out.
I kinda don't want mess this up,
because I'm really enjoying
the way this looks,
just looks really nice and soft.
So now I'm gonna go with
the transition color again
and I'm gonna just pop
it underneath my eyes
to just complete this
really diffused look.
(jazz music)
I can't forget about the inner corners
so I'm gonna go in with this
champagne shade over here
and we're gonna pop that,
I need to stop saying pop,
I'm going to apply that
right in the inner corners
and this is just gonna highlight this area
and make it look nice and
fresh and bright eyed.
And then with that same champagne,
I'm gonna place it on my brow bone.
This is going very swimmingly.
It's gonna go straight into mascara,
I'm going to give my lashes a little pump.
Okay, and now I'm gonna
use this waterproof mascara
from Wet 'n Wild, this is
their Megaslim Skinny Mascara
and I love the little wand, it is so tiny
and it's gonna really get
into the nooks and crannies
of my lashes and while I'm doing this,
I should answer a question.
&quot;Hi Jen, I love your content
and appreciate the way
&quot;you conduct yourself with
so much grace and soul.&quot;
Thank you!
&quot;How do you maintain close
knit bonds with your family
&quot;and friends that are further away
&quot;while balancing constant travel
and a busy work schedule?&quot;
I thought this was a really great question
because as you get
older it does get harder
to see your friends and your family
because life gets in the way.
I mean, especially your friends
because when you're in
school you're kind of forced
to see them every single day
and so it's very convenient
but when you get older
you have to make the time
and effort to go and see them
and as someone who considers
herself a workaholic
it's really important for me to find time
for all the things that I love,
which is work, family and friends
and I think the biggest lesson for me
is to never take anything personal.
If someone's too busy
for you at the moment,
don't take it personal.
They're going through a
lot and you gotta give
them their space but just know that
you will eventually see
them and when you do
don't try and have grudges
or don't be spiteful.
I think it's really important as adults
to recognize that schedules come in waves
and business comes in waves.
I think with the age of technology
there are so many different
ways that you can reach
out to your friend, whether it is
a call or a text, email, FaceTime.
When I am missing a friend,
I'm just really honest,
I don't care about sounding needy
or anything, I'm just like, hey,
I really miss you, how are you?
Are you free on this day,
do you wanna catch up?
And when we do meet even if
we haven't seen each other
in a month it's like nothing has happened.
We just pick up where we last left off
and we're just excited to see each other
and I think that is what
friendship is about.
I mean, we're gonna live
for a pretty long time,
and there's still so much
time for us to be friends
so if we don't see each
other every single day
it's not the end of the world.
As long as we care for each
other and we're gonna make time
for each other, that's what matters.
I finished mascara and I just
want a little extra help,
just at little bit, so gonna go in
with these Ardell Demi-Wispies
which are another holy grail of mine
and I'm just gonna pop
that onto my eyelids.
(jazz music)
The lashes are on, the
glue is a little bit wet
so it's gonna dry down.
It's okay Cheeky, oh man,
Cheeky's right next to me
and she looks so messed up.
So, it's kind of an
off-tangent, but basically
we took Cheeky to our normal groomers
and they normally do a
decent job, it's not amazing
but she's cleaned, she's
washed, but this time
we took her in and we got a call
and they said that they had
nicked the back of her neck.
And we're like, oh my God is she okay?
They're like, &quot;Yeah, she's
fine, we're gonna put
&quot;some antiseptic on it, she'll be fine.&quot;
And we're like okay, just let us know when
we can come get her and then
we get another call saying,
&quot;Okay, so Cheeky's in
the Vet now, and she had
&quot;to get two stitches on
the back of her neck,
&quot;everything's fine, but
she had to go to sleep.&quot;
Now she keeps scratching
the back of her neck now
and I can't put the cone on her
because the cone chafes
where the whole cut is,
but (sighs) it's just freakin' annoying,
obviously the groomers
took care of the bill
and everything, but it's
just very inconvenient
for us and it's just
very traumatic for Cheeky
'cause she was having such a great day
and she didn't expect
to go in the hospital
and get all drugged up, but, yeah,
they weren't able to
even finish cutting her,
so half her body is shaved
and the other half is full.
So, I'll show you a picture later,
but poor girl, they have to take
the stitches out in two weeks,
but I'm never going to
that place ever again,
so definitely in the
market for a new groomer.
So, today I'm just gonna skip contour,
I wanna go straight into blush.
I'm using this one by Colourpop
and unfortunately I don't know the name
of this palette, it's not on here at all,
but it is this orange
one and I'm gonna grab
my little blush brush and apply that
to the apples of my cheeks.
And I know Colourpop
isn't a drugstore brand
but it's so affordable that I thought
that you guys wouldn't be too mad
if I gave 'em a little shout out.
But I'm gonna put this on my cheeks.
(jazz music)
So let's move on to highlighter now.
I'm using this one by Wet 'n Wild,
it is their Bronze Over
The Rainbow highlighter
and as you can see there's
a bunch of little strips
on there, but I'm just
gonna focus my brush just
on these three here 'cause I
just want the lightest colors.
And while I do that, I will
answer another question,
I guess this will be the final one.
&quot;Do you have any advice for introverts
&quot;who are just trying to make friends
&quot;in a world full of extroverts?&quot;
So I wanted to highlight this question
because I actually think that the world
is more full of introverts.
The more I live my life
I meet more people,
the more I realize that
people like to categorize
themselves as introverts
because, I don't know,
even the people with the
loudest personalities
and are always telling the funny stories
they have social anxiety and they need
a day or two to recover
so I think understanding
that you don't need to be an extrovert
to be interesting is really important.
And I also think that being shy
and being like the
classic textbook introvert
is really beautiful because I feel like
the world needs a lot more listeners.
'Cause these days I feel like
a lot of people are talking
at each other, bombarding
them with different facts
and stuff, but personally,
I really prefer to listen.
I would categorize myself as an ambivert,
meaning that I swing both ways.
But it's true, there are some
days where I feel extroverted
and I feel pumped up from
being around a lot of people
and I just feel amazing,
but like 70% of the time
after a big event or after
just constantly talking
I need a day to just kind of shut away
and not be around anybody.
But regardless, I think being an introvert
is a beautiful thing because you can make
a lot more friends just by
being interested in someone,
rather than being interesting.
Like personally, I love when communication
is like a two-way street
and it really means
a lot to me when someone listens to me.
It takes a lot for me to speak up
and I don't know why that is,
but I guess I've just always
naturally been kind of shy,
it took me a long time to get this far
and I've been working at it.
But to answer your question, I think that
you can absolutely make a bunch
of friends while being introverted.
I think you just need to start creating
kind of like an arsenal of questions
you can ask people,
because that's what I do.
I feel like that's my
social defense mechanism.
Whenever I feel really anxious
about meeting new people,
I literally just ask them
a bunch of questions,
whether it be where are you from,
tell me about your home
town, what did you do today?
Sometimes if I see their
Insta Story, I'll be like
oh my gosh, what happened with so-and-so?
So, yeah, I think just start off
by creating three or four questions
that you would just
naturally like to ask people.
And at first it's gonna feel very odd,
you know, you're gonna ask questions
like what's your favorite color?
But I think as you continue
to do it and you practice
it's gonna be something that
comes more naturally to you.
So I'm gonna finish this
off with the lip color,
I'm using this one by Maybelline,
it is their Super Stay Matte Ink.
(jazz music)
Alright guys, this is the finished look.
I hope you guys enjoyed it.
I would call this look kind of like
an effortlessly glam look for the summer,
whatever you wanna call it.
But it was super easy to
do and I love that you
could just get all these
items at the drugstore.

do more makeup tutorials,

types of makeup looks
