here visiting my boyfriend Ben for six
or five days so not that long but got to
make it work we're in a long-distance
relationship so the back and forth is
totally worth it me and Ben just had
this huge brunch we got pancakes with
bacon on top got a full English
breakfast got some granola with dried
fruit so we definitely indulged and
speaking of brunch I did a skit with
diet pepsi in the platform where we did
a bunch of scenarios that happen at
brunch a lot of the platform girls
including candy Johnson teni ray-ray
shameless Maya a bunch of us girls did a
little skit and my skit is about that
friend so it's a scenario where you
think you know someone vice-versa but
you're too polite to say like where you
knew that person so yeah it'll make more
sense if once you watch the clip so I'll
put a link down here and in the
description box so check it out if you
want to see it so today is gonna be full
of activities I'm meeting up with a
bunch of friends
I'm meeting Sta a que se button who's
one of my favorite vloggers I've been
watching her since I don't know since
even when I was in Davis and were we
really connected on a level because she
was talking about being homesick and I
was very homesick when I first moved to
college so we had that bond and then
after I'm gonna meet with yanan aka I
dress myself
aka pretty sickly she goes by a number
of handles I think those were the only
two but yeah she's got amazing style she
has like a full sleeve tattoo and she
just dresses really cool I'm really
excited to meet her as well

gonna meet Estee because it's almost

got about three more hours to go and
there's lots of traffic yes very excited

experience what an English beach is like

try and dip my toes in even if it means
that to wear a sweater and a turtleneck
waiting to see and the lollies
everything hello it is the first
official day in Suffolk and we came last
night super late Ben and I were the
first to arrive so the house was really
dark and scary I was pitch black but we
managed to turn on the lights make it
feel homey turn on the TV put some music
on and yeah and everyone came everyone

little party last night it was great and

start Fraser and psy made the most
