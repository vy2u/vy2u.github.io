of the month or guests the first of the
month so that means it's time for
favorites and February was a very good
month for me so here are the things that
made it more special I love over
accessorizing but sometimes the
necklaces can get a little bit messy and
tedious so that's why I'm a big fan of
just having one huge statement necklace
one necklace that I've been really been
wearing non-stop has been this silver
one from Urban Outfitters if you follow
me on Instagram it's been in a ton of
outfits last month and I thought I would
do a little shout out I've read quite a
few comments saying that this was really
similar to long necklaces which I
thought was amazing one day it would be
so killer to have on an authentic one
but this one will do for now skin care
is super important to me and I always
need to use a toner in my skincare
routine and last month I ran out of my
SK 2 toner and so I was in the market
for a new one I just love trying out new
products and a sloth has always been on
my radar since Steph started using it
the girl at the counter recommended this
one to me and it's their BNT a balancing
toner and it's just an everyday gentle
toner that normal to sensitive skin
people can use and I basically just get
a cotton round and I apply a couple of
drops on it and then I just smooth it
all over my face after I've cleansed it
and it just does a really good job
balancing everything out and it removes
any you know lingering makeup that
happens to stay on my face even despite
the cleanse so it's just a really great
way to make sure everything is off that
face I'm a night shower because I like
to get all nice and clean at the end of
the day and I've added a new shower gel
to the mix this is philosophes vanilla
bean shower gel and it's actually a 3
and 1/2 bit deal you can use it as a
shampoo a body wash and 4 bowl of bats
and I think for bubble baths I might use
it for but for shampoo I don't know I
don't know if it's really gonna work
that way but as a body wash it is
excellent if you are into vanilla scents
this is going to blow your mind it
smells so good every time I use it it's
just so soothing
and therapeutic and it just helps me
unwind and relax before I go to bed the
scent doesn't linger on your body once
you're out of the shower which i think
is a good thing because I like to
moisturize right after so it would be
kind of weird if I was mixing the shower
gel scent with my moisturizers so I find
that it's good that it just stays in one
place the shower like I said after I
shower I love to moisturize and I just
think it's a good habit to have because
your skin needs that moisture it keeps
it soft and just lovely
my best friend Stephanie knows how much
I love the smell of Joe Malone's
nectarine blossom and honey it is it's
just to die for
it smells like citrus and sweet but it's
not sickly it's just the perfect mixture
of the two and she bought me a giant
body cream of it for Christmas which I'm
so happy about for winter I was really
loving my L'Occitane zalman body oil to
moisturize after but now that we're
transitioning more into spring I like to
bring in more fresh and bright sense
into my life my skin just drinks it up
and it makes my sheets smell so good
it's just smells like Jo Malone right
now and I am loving it I'm a big fan of
nude lipsticks but last month I was more
into something with a pack of punch I
have been using lorax vixen which is
part of their alter-ego line and it's
just a beautiful rich fuchsia color and
I'm wearing out on my lips today I know
a few people are kind of weary about
wearing matte lipsticks because they can
be dry and flaky but this one doesn't I
have never had an issue with this being
you know clumpy and flaky it just is
really long-lasting and I find that it's
really velvety smooth all day I've seen
quite a few movies last month because I
was in the airplane a lot and there are
a lot of movie options and one movie
that really took me by surprise was big
hero 6 I initially thought it was like
the sixth version of a movie like a
sequel or something but it's just one of
one of its own kind it's about a boy
named Hiro and this robot named baymax
and oh my god
baymax is so adorable it's this big
white puffy robot that just takes care
of people and there are several things I
loved about this movie
first up the protagonist was
asian-american and I thought that
awesome because you don't see a lot of
Asian American people in traditional
media I'm not saying that they never do
but it's just quite rare second the
setting took place in a fictional city
called San fransokyo and it's a fusion
of my two favorite cities Tokyo in San
Francisco and so it was really cool
seeing both of these cities become
animated there were still landmarks of
us stuff which i thought was cool like
the Embarcadero third I love me a bit of
sci-fi and so it was really awesome
getting to see the robots and the
technology in the film obviously it was
marketed for children but I think it was
an enjoyable movie for anyone of any age
if you're at the type of person who
likes to wind down a day by watching a
film this is a great well-rounded
blockbuster hit to really get you know
you're feeling good before bed as
promised I have a monthly playlist for
you February was the month of love so I
created a series of my favorite love
songs a lot of the ones were ones that I
listened to wells in high school so
there's a lot of nostalgic value to them
but I also added contemporary hits to
make it a little bit more modern so
please check it out the reason why I
felt a little bit stretched at the
beginning of the year was because I was
filming episodes for refinery29 and I
couldn't really say anything because we
hadn't officially launched it yet
but the first few episodes are out now
and I'm so excited about them the first
video was my la home so if you want to
see a tour of it you can click on it and
we have some New York Fashion Week
episodes and we have this amazing
workout video with my girl Cassie aka
Blogilates and you can watch them here
we're filming it throughout the year so
there's gonna be like I don't know 40
episodes of it so it's gonna be really
awesome
there's gonna be a new episode out every
Friday so make sure you subscribe to our
fine and 29 for more videos so those are
my favorites I am definitely feeling a
lot happier and more settled into my new
place my boyfriend's in town so I'm
extra kitty and he's been helping me you
know build furniture and rearrange
things in the house which is nice if
you'd like to comment down below what
has been inspiring you
sponge please do and subscribe if you
haven't already and I just I just hope
you have a great rest of your day and
