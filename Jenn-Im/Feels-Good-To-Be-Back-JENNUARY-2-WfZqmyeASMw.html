- [Jenn] Oh my gosh,
look what we have here.
They have the Canon Rebel T7i.
I am filming this with a Canon T3i,
so you've come a long way Canon.
Great job.
(upbeat music)
This is the Canon M6.
This might be my new vlogging camera.
- [Ben] Flip out screens are important.
- And it's also so light.
Wish I could do like a side
by side comparison, I know.
So I'm back at home with the
new Canon EOS M6, I believe.
This was recommended to
me by my friend Jesse.
Thank you so much.
So far, I don't really
know what to think about it
other than that it's a lot lighter.
I don't know how the sound is,
or what the quality difference is
so I guess this is just a test.
This is using the new camera.
I am currently on my way to the West side.
Doing a couple of things out there.
First, we are going to
the Hourglass event.
They came out with a new highlighter.
I'm really excited to try them out.
They are cream.
And then after, we are
gonna have dinner with
Ashley and Vanan.
We are going to talk
about our goals for 2018.
So yeah, it's going to
be a very full night
and then when I get back
home, we are celebrating
Robin's belated birthday.
It's been a really long time
since we've all been together.
So it's going to be nice.
(upbeat music)
- Hi!
- Hey!
- Wow!
- Hello, everybody!
It is 5:30 p.m.
I'm about to have a shot of coffee.
And then head off to dinner.
Having a belated birthday
dinner with this one!
We've got a little gem salad and hamachi!
Yum!
(gentle rock music)
(upbeat music)
(speaking foreign language)
(speaking foreign language)
(laughing)
This is one of my guilty pleasures.
Oh, yeah.
Oh and another one of my guilty pleasures.
- California roll.
- California roll.
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
- Thank you.
- Make a wish!
♪ Make a wish ♪
(speaking foreign language)
- I love you, umma.
(speaking foreign language)
Hello everybody!
I am back in the office.
Today was a very, very productive day.
Filmed the B roll for
the thrift haul video
and the speaking portion.
And that's why my office is a mess again.
I'm so sad, I feel like I just cleaned it.
Right now, I'm gonna start editing my vlog
for you guys for the Sunday video.
It is my goal to start
uploading two times on YouTube.
Later on, I'm going to
my friend Kelly's house
to help her clean her house.
I think if I wasn't doing YouTube,
I would definitely be doing something
in like the service industry,
or even like cleaning houses.
I freaking love to organize,
especially when it's not my stuff.
I would love to be a part
of the Hoarders cast,
just to excavate an entire property
and just redecorate it and reorganize.
That's what I'm doing today
and then we're gonna have dinner
with Anna, Jesse, and Claire, and Ben.
So, it's gonna be good
to have a little reunion,
see some familiar faces.
(upbeat music)
Oh my goodness.
I'm about to just gain back
what we just worked out.
We got a little breakfast burrito.
Let's dig in.
(upbeat music)
At Sophie's!
- Hi!
- She's amazed with my
new vlogging camera!
- It's amazing.
- It's so light, feel it.
- Wow!
Taking over!
I will show you the spread.
We are having a house meeting at my house,
so we have a cheese plate.
We have chips and salsa.
Annie's, so good!
- [Jenn] These are amazing.
- And Greek yogurt dip and some veggies.
Healthy snack.
- Healthy snack.
If there's a heaven on
earth, it is this place.
Oh, yes.
And look at their plates, they are rammed!
Two full plates of salad!
Meanwhile.
- Us.
- Us.
We're pacing ourselves, you know?
- We're pacing ourselves.
- [Jenn] Yes.
You gotta eat this all.
- I'm about to.
- You better.
Ben, that looks pretty ambitious as well.
- Yeah.
- Andy's plate, very reasonable.
It's a feast!
They make the best
salads in the world here.
- [Andy] It's very homey.
- Well done, well done.
Huh, this'll do.
Hi, guys, I am in the car.
I am currently on my way
to go shoot with my friend, Rebekkah.
If you guys have been watching
my channel for a long time,
then you know who she is.
She is one of my friends that
I met at community college.
It's actually really so pure how we met.
I remember it was during one
of our really long breaks
and I just saw her sitting down
on one of the planters
and she had really cool style
and I was like I'm just gonna go up to her
and say that I like her outfit
and become friends with her.
That was my objective
because when I got out
of high school, I was like, you know what
a lot of my high school friends have left
but I'm gonna try and
create a new community.
She became my friend
and we just hit it off.
We had a lot of the same interests.
I am obsessed with this bookshelf.
You've got little knick knacks.
Oh my gosh, I'm getting
a lot of inspiration
for my bookshelf, honestly.
And there's the woman
of the hour, Rebekkah!
- Can't forget Stella, though.
- [Jenn] Hi Stella!
Hey baby!
How cute the living room is!
It's like a spread in
Kinfolk or something.
(upbeat music)
We've made our selects
and now Rebekkah is gonna
do her thing on Lightroom.
Do you remember the first
time we met, Bekkah?
- Yeah, I was sitting--
- On a planter, right?
- I was sitting on a
planter and you were like,
&quot;Hi, you look lonely.
&quot;Do you wanna hang out with me?&quot;
And I was like &quot;Oh, I
am lonely, yeah, sure.&quot;
- Oh my god.
See, I stone-cold went up to her.
- You were like, &quot;You look
like you want some friends.&quot;
- Did I say that?
- Something like that.
That is a miracle in someone's life.
Like, their first year in college,
someone comes up to them and is like,
&quot;Do you want to be my friend?&quot;
And I was like, &quot;Yeah,
sure, is this happening?&quot;
Do not second-guess whether
or not they're gonna
think you're weird because
you're actually gonna make their day.
And you might be friends
with them for as long
as we've been friends.
- I know.
Here is my Green Goddess smoothie,
and Alexa got the Peanut Butter.
You guys, this is truly a miracle.
I am going away to San
Francisco for a couple of days
and I am only flying with a carry-on!
I can't even think of the last
time I traveled like this.
But yeah, Amy inspired me
to travel light and so I am!
Normally, I always have like two bags,
no matter how long a trip is.
I will always have a carry-on
and then I'll have a big one.
I'm so excited to just breeze by.
Oh, I also can bring my Global Entry card
because I'm traveling alone,
so let me go grab that.
Yes, I am heading to San
Jose slash San Francisco
to go visit Sarah.
I haven't seen her since the holidays
and so we thought we would do kinda
like a trip together
because I haven't seen
her in such a long time.
Check this Global Entry out.
I am flying into San Jose,
which is where she lives.
And then she is going to show me
where she works, where she lives.
And so I can finally see what her side
of the world looks like.
And then we are traveling
all the way to Oakland.
I think it's like an hour drive.
And then we are gonna stay at an Air BnB.
But yeah, this weekend
should be super fun.
I'm so excited.
So, yeah, I gotta go get an Uber right now
because I'm about to be late.
♪ Hello, hello, hello ♪
♪ Hello, hello, hello ♪
- So I just landed in San Jose
and I saw Sarah's lovely little home,
and she packed her bag and now we are here
in San Francisco.
And we are at our lovely
Air BnB here in Rockridge.
It is perfect for two people.
Here is the bed we'll be sleeping on.
A little desk area, which
will be nice in the daytime.
A cute little kitchen space.
We've got a kettle.
We can make some tea, perhaps.
And, we've got a full
fridge with a microwave.
So, yeah, Sarah is just
gonna finish getting ready
and then we're gonna do
a night out on the town.
Oh, man, last night was so much fun.
We had dinner, oh, that's cute, I like it.
- [Sarah] It's super chill, I do too.
- Last night was so much fun.
We started off,
where did we start off?
Oh, we went to the Golden
Squirrel in Oakland.
- Oh, that's what it's called.
- Yeah!
(laughs)
I only remember the
name because there were
squirrels everywhere.
I was like, wow, they're
really going for the theme.
We danced so much.
- That was so fun.
- Yeah, it was really fun.
- The first ten minutes
was just our high school.
- Yes, literally, they were playing
hip-hop songs from our
era, from like 2005.
- I didn't even know that was a thing.
- Yeah, right?
But we literally knew every
single song that came out.
We were like, &quot;We know this song!&quot;
- Every song
- &quot;Oh!&quot;
- &quot;We know this song!&quot;
I loved 1015 because
there's so many rooms.
There was like three different stages.
- [Sarah] Yeah, that was cool.
- And they were all distinct as well.
And then our friend, Segundo,
was deejaying the mainstage.
And then we saw the Ying Yang Twins.
I woke up and I was like.
- Took a nice walk to Trade Joe's.
- She got me oranges.
She's like, &quot;What do you
want from Trader Joe's?&quot;
I was like,
&quot;Advil and oranges.&quot;
- I was gonna ask
what kind of eye drops you wanted--
- Aww, that's so nice!
- But I didn't want to
get you out of your half sleep.
That place is promising
for the eye drops you need.
They might be overpriced though.
What are we doing today?
We're gonna go get chicken sandwiches at
Bake?
- Bakesale Betty.
- And strawberry shortcake and then,
we're gonna go, what cemetery is it?
- Oakland Cemetery.
- Oakland Cemetery, yeah.
(upbeat music)
- [Jenn] Here we have the
famous fried chicken sandwich
at Bakesale Betty.
I love this sandwich!
Gotta have some hot sauce on the side.
- [Sarah] I can't believe we're eating.
We walked for like, years.
- I know, we went the wrong way.
I directed us the opposite way,
so I added an extra mile to our trip.
(upbeat music)
Here we are!
We walked all the way to the cemetery.
How are you feeling?
- Warm.
- So, we have our apple
pie from Bakesale Betty
and we're gonna have it on a bench here.
(upbeat music)
♪ Hello, hello, hello ♪
♪ Hello, hello, hello ♪
- Good?
(upbeat music)
- Hello, everybody!
It is Monday afternoon.
I am back from the Bay Area
and it feels good to be back home.
But honestly, I could have
used one extra day in the Bay.
That would have been nice.
I think I was just really
enjoying my time over there.
Sarah is one of those friends where
even if I don't speak
to her in like months,
when we do see each other,
it's like no time has passed.
I'm really happy that I made an effort
to go out and see her because
we took a love language
test during Thanksgiving
and her number one was quality time.
And I believe mine was
quality time as well.
I just knew if I want to
fulfill this love language,
I have to go make an
effort to fly out more.
Today is just a day of just getting
my life back together.
I've cleaned the house.
I have put all of my luggage away.
Just basically my normal routine
that I do when I get back from a big trip.
I'm gonna go see my therapist today
and I'm really excited
because I try and see her
at least two or three times a month.
If you have quite a
cluttered mind like I do,
it feels really good
to just release it out
to a professional.
I mean, I recommend therapy to everybody.
If you have the time
and you have the funds
to save up and go to therapy,
I highly recommend it.
I even asked my therapist
if she had a therapist.
And she told me that she has one.
So, I mean, that speaks volumes.
Also, there are definitely
cheaper alternatives
for a therapist.
I remember my first one
I got with my healthcare
and it was only $40 per session.
I know it's still like $40,
but you can't put a
price on mental health.
Even though technically, you already did.
- [Flight Attendent] Ladies and gentlemen,
it is our pleasure to
welcome you to Vancouver
where the local time is
approximately 12:30 p.m.
- Hello from Vancouver!
I literally just landed like an hour ago
and I just got to my hotel room.
Staying at the Shangri-La.
It is so swanky up in here.
I am here in Vancouver
with Ashley and Stephanie.
We're gonna see the
Takashi Murakami exhibition
at this museum that's a
couple of roads that way.
But I'm so stoked because we actually
get to meet him, which is insane.
I don't really know what kind
of look I want to do today
because it's kinda rainy and dreary
so maybe I'll do something more exciting
to contrast the weather.
I brought this violet
glitter eyeshadow from Stila.
This is called Violet Vixen.
I mean maybe I'll feel
motivated to use this
because it's been a long
time since I've used color.
Maybe I could use this
tomorrow for the exhibition.
But we'll see.
Either way, we're here until Saturday
so I'm so excited to explore.
I hear that the Asian
food here is so delicious
so I'm ready to get some gains.
(muffled television chattering)
- Cheers!
- To Vancouver.
- Ashley literally went for the fry
I was stabbing and you
took it off of my fork.
- [Jenn] Sisters.
- And then you went for the
fry that I was stabbing.
- Back in the hotel room.
They gave us this really beautiful dessert
inspired by Murakami.
It is kinda like a mushroom structure,
a macaroon,
some chocolates,
and a chocolate brownie.
We're gonna have dinner later.
- You're going to the
spa in like half an hour.
- I'm getting a massage!
- Yeah, dude.
- I'm so excited.
So what can I expect in this massage?
- Just a lot of slippery,
slippery stuff going on.
You know, where are the arms?
You don't know where the limbs are.
You don't know where she's standing.
Just a lot of smooth motion.
- That was the best massage ever.
(smooth music)
All right guys, that is the end of
the Jennuary vlog.
I hope you guys enjoyed.
Be prepared for our Vancouver trip.
Or be prepared for more Vancouver clips
in the February vlog.
I want to thank you guys
so much for watching
and I'll see you guys in the next one.
Bye!
