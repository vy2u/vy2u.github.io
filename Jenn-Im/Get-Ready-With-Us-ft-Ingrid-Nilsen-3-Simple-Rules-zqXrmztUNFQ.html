- Hey everyone, it's your girl Jen,
and this is the second episode of
my mini-series with Simple Skincare,
who is sponsoring this video.
Last week, we had the
wonderful Jackie Aina,
but today, we have a new guest,
and we're just gonna be chatting about
how you can avoid the
daily stress of your life
from affecting your skin.
And we're gonna be doing a really fun,
stress-free makeup challenge,
where we're just gonna be
sharing tips on how you can
keep your skin hydrated,
using Simple Skincare's
new Water Boost products.
All right, guys, here she is, Ingrid!
- Hi, everyone.
- Oh my god, this is so trippy,
- I know.
- Having you at my house.
- I know, it is.
- You're one of the first
people I saw on YouTube.
- Really?
- Miss Glamorazzi, yeah.
- Oh my god!
That's so crazy, I didn't know that!
- Yeah, no this is insane.
- I know, I feel like
I have been following
your fashion journey since
before I was even on YouTube,
or maybe right when I first started.
- Dang, that's nuts!
No, 'cause I've always been
silently following you as well,
but I always assume that there would be
some sort of event or occasion.
- I know, we never see each other.
- We've never run across
each other, it's insane.
So, today we're gonna be
just doing our makeup,
and also, we've added
a little twist to it.
We're gonna be adding some rules.
You ready?
- Love me some rules.
- So, the rules are in this hat,
so if you wanna pick them out
and then I can explain each one.
- Okay, what am I pulling out?
What am I doing to myself?
- They're large strips.
- I know, they are.
Okay, after you finish
a section of makeup,
you must frame your face with your hands.
- Nice!
- So, vogueing.
- Exactly.
So, after you finish your brows,
you go ding, or like that.
- I am going to get so into these rules
that when I go home and
I'm just doing my makeup
in everyday life, I'm ...
- Is he applying it?
All right, foundation's done.
- Pat your head before
using a particular item.
- So this one's, okay,
let's say I'm doing the setting spray.
I'll just grab this and, you know,
just do a little pat.
- Thumbmaster, 10 seconds for
another person to place thumb
before getting penalized.
- You just silently press
your thumb on the table,
and if I don't notice,
or if you don't notice,
within 10 seconds, then you get a strike.
- Okay, great, I feel
like you found yourself
the perfect competitor,
'cause I'm gonna fail it all!
- (cackles) My plan all along!
We're doing a fall-inspired
look, because summer is over.
Isn't that crazy?
- I know.
- So, before we get started,
I think we should cleanse our face first.
Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, I love this micellar water.
- I know, it's really awesome.
It's incredible.
- So, I'm just gonna
douse my cotton round,
and I'm just gonna wipe
my entire face down.
And I really like this because
it's so hydrating and refreshing,
and when you have a hydrated base,
then your makeup just goes on more evenly.
- I know, I like how my skin doesn't feel
dry and tight after it.
- Look, where did this come from?
- I know.
- I washed my ...
- I had no makeup on my face.
Where did this come from?
Just air
- It's all dirt.
- And then, one of my
favorite things to use
is the hydrating booster,
and I've been using this every day,
and I love it because
it's really hydrating,
and it also is a really great primer.
I normally mix it into my moisturizer,
but then sometimes, I'll
add another layer on top,
just because I really like it a lot.
- And your face is nice,
it's hydrated, it's prepped.
- Oh my god, it feels so
much better than before.
Okay, so are we gonna start on this?
Makeup?
- Our makeup?
Oh my god, okay!
Let's do it.
- What do you normally start with?
- Foundation, or concealer.
- I start with my eyes.
- Oh, is it for fallout
or something like that?
- Yeah, kinda.
I guess I'm just also ...
I've just gotten into the
habit of doing my eyes first.
Originally, it was for
fallout, but now, I don't know.
- I feel like everyone has
their own little systems,
and this is my ritual, foundation.
- I know.
- Did you pat your head, missy?
- Oh!
See I told you.
- Can someone strike that?
Okay, okay.
Make sure you put a point on her, okay?
I patted my head.
You can rewind the tape to make sure.
(bell dings)
- Okay, so, I really
wanna ask you about Eggie,
because I saw that that just
launched and that's so cool.
- Thank you.
I have been working on
it for such a long time,
since the beginning of last year,
And so to have it--
- Oh my gosh, wow.
- Yeah.
It was supposed to launch
the beginning of summer,
so then we started, as
the dates got pushed back,
we started to, oh crap,
we gotta think about more fall stuff,
'cause it's gonna launch in August now.
So, it's just been a
really crazy experience,
and I am so proud and happy
of the way it turned out.
And this is just the beginning.
- It's especially cool,
I think, to see people
who have been doing it for a while,
and just the different
paths that people take,
and now you having Eggie,
I just think it's so cool to see.
Oh my god.
- Oh my god.
- Recently, I was with some friends,
and they made everybody
watch their first videos.
- Oh my gosh, wait, what
was your first video?
- So, my actual first
video is not up anymore.
- Oh, you took it down?
- Yeah, I took it down really early on,
maybe within the first month
that I was making videos,
'cause I was like, I don't like it.
I wasn't thinking,
oh this is something I'm
gonna wanna look back on.
- Yeah, memories.
- So the the first one that's
up, is a red lip tutorial.
- Oh, snap.
- Yeah, and I was watching
it, like, oh my god.
- Oh, how old were you?
- I was 20.
- 20, oh?
- It was just so
interesting to think about,
how much life has changed,
and how much you grow up,
especially in your 20s, too.
- Yeah, 20s is such a crazy,
fundamental part of your life,
and every year is so different.
- I know.
- Like, 20 to 21?
And 21 to 22?
- I know.
- I look back at 23 and I'm like,
whoa, what were you doing girl?
It's crazy.
- Like, things that you think
are totally fine, and cool,
you look back on, and you're, like
nope!
- Nope!
- But I feel like that's
what your 20s are for.
- Exactly.
- You have to learn from your 20s.
(Ingrid sighs)
- What?
(soft pat)
Oh my god! (laughs)
(Ingrid sighs)
Oh my god.
- I'm so ashamed.
- Oh, it's okay, stop.
Don't let the game getcha down.
- This is what my 20s are for.
- Yeah, right?
- Figuring things out.
- I want to ask about your
skin care routine actually,
- Oh really?
- Because your skin looks so gorgeous.
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah, so what are your
tips and tricks, eh?
- I actually don't use too many products,
and I try to stick with
things that are really gentle.
So, I was telling you
earlier, that I've been using
Simple since before they
even came to the States.
- Yeah, I had no idea they were
just in the U.K. for a long time.
- Yeah, so whenever I would
travel, I would always
get a pack of their wipes,
'cause I love them so much.
So that's why I'm excited
that they came over here,
'cause I use the micellar water
and the wipes and the
booster all the time.
I've really been into K
beauty things recently.
- Oh nice.
- So I've been using this
watermelon sleeping mask,
and that has just been
amazing for my skin,
and typically, products like
that, that have AHAs in them,
my skin is super-sensitive.
- Wait, AHAs?
- Alpha hydroxy acids.
- What? Okay, wow.
I've never heard of that term before.
- They exfoliate your skin.
It's almost like a chemical exfoliation.
- Oh, interesting.
- And, let me just put this on my face
before I really mess something up.
So, normally, that's really
irritating for my skin,
but with this, there's so
many moisturizers in the mask,
and you wear it over night,
that my skin just eats it all up.
I love it.
- I think the main thing
about skin care for me
is to always make sure
that everything is removed.
So I always double cleanse,
and even triple sometimes.
- Yeah, me too.
- Sometimes at the end
I'll just do final layer
of this micellar water,
and it just takes out
everything that's on there.
- I know, I always finish with that.
And I use it in the
morning as a pre-cleanse
to get rid of any night
treatments that are on my face.
- Oh, cool.
Okay, I am done with
brows (clicks tongue).
Where are you at?
- That is what I--
- I am just putting on a little
bit of under eye concealer,
and then I am going to set my face--
- Nice.
- with some spray.
I always look like I'm afraid of
my face spray when I put it on,
'cause it's always a
little startling for me.
So I just need to set
this, and then I can vogue.
(bottles crashing)
- Oh god, oh no!
- Oh my god.
- My god. Rest in peace.
Okay, well you caught the
thumb, 'cause that ...
Oh, it blew my cover.
Okay, all right.
(Ingrid giggles)
- Rogue eye shadow.
- I know.
Okay, let me just go--
- oh my god.
It broke.
- It broke?
(both giggling)
- We're falling apart here.
We're falling apart, guys.
- Okay, moving on.
(both giggling)
- Oh. Messed up.
- Oh my god.
- I slipped.
Every time I do my brows, I
always end up having to do this.
- Same, brows are so tricky.
- I know.
- Yeah.
But this is great for makeup removal.
- Yeah.
- It's my favorite.
- I really like this,
'cause it doesn't have any
harsh chemicals or dyes in it--
- It's so gentle.
- So I feel okay with
putting it near my eyes.
There are certain
mascaras that even, just,
on my eyelashes, make
my eyes water and burn.
- You're like, I don't
think this should be
anywhere near my eye.
- Yeah, I'm like, I don't think this is
how it's supposed to feel.
- So true.
- Is there another city that
you would want to live in?
Or do you think that LA is your ...
- Funny you should ask that.
So, I just went to Toronto in August.
I feel like I've become
this ambassador for Toronto,
I don't know why, but, literally it was
my third time there, and my
friend Dani just showed me
the best spots in Toronto,
and she's just got an
amazing community there,
and I didn't want to leave.
I was like, wow, I could stay
here for another week or so.
- So what made you love Toronto so much?
- Because it's kinda like New York,
but like a nicer New York?
- Yeah.
- Like, the people are more friendly.
And it's just, it's got amazing food,
and everyone that I met
there was just so creative
and positive, and ...
I mean, it could just be the
bubble that Dani showed me,
but it was just super-inspiring
to be in a place like that.
- Well, I feel like the
people that you're with
make such a huge difference.
That's the main reason
why I'm still in LA,
'cause my home base for
people, everybody's here.
- Totally.
But New York is super-inspiring
though, I love it.
- I know. It really is.
- I love the fashion there, as well,
because people just really experiment.
I feel like in LA, there's
so many little pockets
(bottles crashing)
of different ...
Oh!
- I gave you a chance!
- Did I make it?
Did I make it?
(both laughing)
I did it.
But yeah, I feel like in LA,
there's just so many little pockets,
but I feel like the style
is relatively the same.
It's so laid-back here, it's chill.
There's the super-glam Hollywood style,
but in New York, I feel like I see
the most interesting
types of fashion there,
where I'm like, I've
never seen that before.
- I know.
- Okay, I need to just fix this right now.
This is no bueno.
- What happened?
Oh.
- This happened.
(both laughing)
You're like ...
- I'm like
what, I don't see anything.
- Once you see it, you can't unsee it.
I'm so bad with the under lashes.
- I know, I just have stopped
putting mascara there,
'cause I always get it on me.
- I feel like it's a little ritual for me.
Like, I have to put it on
my bottoms and my tops,
no matter what, even
though they're so baby.
That lip color is gorgeous by the way.
- Thank you.
- It really tied-in the
whole fall-inspired look.
- I know, I like keeping
everything else really simple,
but I've always enjoyed
a good statement lip,
as my first video on Youtube displayed.
- Oh yeah right, my red lip.
- What was your first video?
- My first video was
a summer fashion haul.
- Oh my god, I love it.
- Oh my god.
Or no, summer fashion trends?
Yeah, that was so fun.
I did it with my friend Sarah
and that was just a very
pure time on Youtube.
What is something you miss
about the old Youtube?
- How there were a lot
less people, and so,
even just in the comment section,
it felt a lot more personal.
I mean the comment sections
still feel personal,
but it was just different back then.
It was just a different world.
There were less people making videos,
there were less people watching.
I'm still debating whether
I wanna put one more thing.
Well, I'll put one more thing on.
- 'Kay, I'm waiting for my,
I think I just need to do
my lips, and then I'm done.
(soft pat)
- Cool, we're finishing
it at the same time.
- I know, this is great.
What is this?
- It is a highlighter.
- Whoa, liquid.
- [Ingrid] Yeah.
- Nice.
- I really like ... I have also
had this in the powder form,
but I really like the liquid
'cause it just blends so easily.
And even though I've already
put on a setting powder,
I can still put this on top,
and it works really nicely.
It just allows me to use
it in different ways.
Like, I can mix it with things ...
- I feel like I've noticed that
you like the creams for your face.
- Yeah, and I used to hate
them, I used to hate them, but,
it's all just in line with me
trying to embrace my natural shine.
- I like that.
You do your thing.
All right.
- Okay.
I think we finished at the same time,
- I know.
- which is very convenient.
- I just need to spray set
this on my face, and I'm dunzo.
(gentle spritzes)
All right, so this is
our finished fall look.
- Ta-dah.
- Ta-dah.
I love your look by the way.
- Thank you.
- It's wonderful.
- I really love yours too.
I love how you do your eye makeup.
- Thank you.
All right, so this is the serious part.
Let's see what the scores are.
Let's see who won.
- [Woman] Jen with six,
and Ingrid with 18.
- What does that mean?
- [Woman] So you win.
- So I won?
(both laughing)
- I literally lost by so much.
But I was so absorbed
in our conversations.
- True, true.
- But, at least now you
got to win this time.
- Yeah, it does feel good, I must say.
Wow. I'm gonna be glowing all day.
- I know.
- But anyway, thank you so
much for coming on to the show,
and--
- Thanks for having me.
- Yeah, this was awesome.
- I know, it was really
cool being able to meet you,
and hang out, and just chat.
- Seriously.
That was a good catch-up.
- Yeah, it was.
