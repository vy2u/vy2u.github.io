brand new series in collaboration with
simple skincare who is sponsoring this
video
life can be really stressful and not
only just stressed suck it can affect
your skin too and that's why we've
whipped up this really fun stress-free
series where I've just invited a bunch
of my friends over we're gonna be
hanging out and just chatting away doing
fun makeup challenges and also sharing
tips on how we keep our skin healthy and
hydrated using simples new water boost
line today's special guest is my friend
Jackie ina she is one of my favorites on
YouTube and I absolutely love learning
so much about her
I'm so excited to catch up with her and
get some one-on-one time well Jackie hey
girls here your first time at my place
so today we are doing a just get ready
with us but with a twist of course we
are gonna be playing this game called
three simple rules
hmm.well all the rules are in this
lovely basket here and then each time
you break a rule you get a strike and
whoever gets the most strikes they lose
so you want to pick out what rules we're
gonna do are their cash incentives
involved only pick one mm-hmm one at a
time
move your arms like a train when
laughing oh really
so this is the choo-choo train so every
time you up you have to go like this I'm
a professional laugher that's gonna be
hard
they really laugh at everything so this
this situation okay do that all right
okay and the next one is you can't say
yes or no
yeah position your arms like a t-rex
with picking product yeah exactly you
got to figure it up like this and then
once you captured it you get to like
just do your thing but not laughs in the
process because men do Oh
if you t-rex it up but you laughs in the
process you gotta chew chew it out
mm-hmm doctors yeah yeah exactly
nicely tough you know that's why I asked
about cash incentives so today I thought
we would just do like kind of like an
everyday bumped up look so you can put a
little glamour if you'd like so before
we get started I wanted to make sure
that our skin is hydrated and primed so
we're gonna use simples hydrating
booster this is great if you're stressed
out because stress can dehydrate the
skin and then make it more sensitive so
this just kind of reverses all of that
yeah it's so milky so you can use this
as a spa treatment right cuz you have
oily skin right I have like combination
oh yeah I have more combination so this
area here is more normal for me so I'm
just gonna pop out in that area nice
where it tends to get a little bit more
dry mm-hmm and what about you I'm just
like a normal girl sometimes you get dry
during like the wintertime so I'm just
gonna use it all over and as a primer
it's genetics thank you thank you mom
and dad I'm just using all over as a
primer but you can also mix this in with
your moisturizer too it feels like a
primer yeah Jackie in a good way
so like the makeup can really stay yeah
like it kind of like grabs onto anything
oh yeah all right a little boost all
right so now that our skin is prepped
let's get started let's get beat shall
we
you ready no it's okay
Hey okay there you go there you go okay
okay seriously so what are using for
foundation oh that's one of my favorites
I know that's my bus good now I gotta
cuz you really didn't you can miss me
absolutely foundation that works for
like aa skin types you know know what if
we sign up for you so how long does it
take you to get ready not a good day
well if it's like on a luxurious day
where I have time to kill like hang out
this is jazz music yeah yeah yeah two
hours like an hour and a half it's like
is that you showering from the time I
crime to like wig on styled curled so
it's hair and me go yeah but but like on
a normal day like an hour okay if I'm
like if I have to be out the door let's
say like I'm just doing like a easy
shoot it would take me like third twenty
minutes thirty minutes what yeah if I
need to be out the house I can do it in
30 minutes that's but that's like your
wing may not be even girl but you got
you gotta pick your poison
exactly you gotta be you got a deadline
to meet so either you go sacrifice
something
okay so Jackie just had her 30th
birthday party which was so crazy
she had like rented out the whole
penthouse of mr. C's and veterans it was
so nice saw panoramic views of the city
there was sushi there was literally
fellas I know because I'll I've never
been to a party like that before enough
I couldn't believe it and so I knew
Stephanie I'm saying they're like way
longer we saw your grand entrance like
how did you think that we just went well
because our inspo was coming to America
so we wanted to be super like extra if
you're risking the movie coming to
America then you know it has a heads
very extra bronzer okay I love how that
was so tragic right yeah that's so sad I
was like please okay so we're you know
okay I mean you've already like baked
and yeah I I'm just slow down and it's
slow my roll hey little girl I don't

styler is the bomb oh but your
collaboration with Too Faced
wait animation you waited to announce
that was hard we said when does it lunch
so basically it's in effect now man yeah
it's gonna take however long it takes to
get in the lab and start formulating I
do want to name one foundation after one
of my viewers because I've got people
that have reached out to me and they've
been like I'm one of those like weird
in-between shades like Kimmy and I know
that a lot of other people like you know
