- Alright, workout complete.
I just did my standard workout today.
I did 20 minutes of cardio,
I went on the treadmill.
I'm so happy to say that my
knee is officially better.
After just being on the
StairMaster for over a year,
my knee has finally
regenerated and now I can run
on the treadmill again, but
honestly, by the 18 minute mark,
it was starting to feel
a little bit weird,
but I just got off then, and then
I did 27 minutes of strength training.
This is a big day, you guys.
Ben is finally making the
jacket potato and beans recipe.
- I didn't know this wasn't...
It's not much of a thin in America.
It's a classic English dish.
Pop a jacket potato in
the oven for an hour,
get it nice and crispy.
Get some cheese, some English baked beans,
and it's just delightful.
Jenn's never had it, which is...
- [Jenn] No.
- As most of you guys know,
she loves her magic beans,
as we call them.
- I do love my magic beans.
Hmm.
Okay, you can stop.
Just put the whole block in, babe.
(laughing)
I've never seen a sight so beautiful.
Wow, this looks incredible.
I can't wait to eat this.
It's so beautiful!
Holy crap!
This is incredible!
- [Ben] When you get it in
England they put so much
boss on the potato, so much cheese.
It's just absolutely delicious.
(chill music)
- Guys, my hair is done.
Annelise did a phenomenal job.
I got a haircut, we got some highlights.
We did a glossing, we did
another type of glossing,
so my hair feels so healthy.
I can literally run my
fingers through my hair
without getting caught, and prior to that,
I couldn't do it, so I'm loving this.
So now I'm just gonna put my stuff away,
throw on a belt, throw on a red lip,
and we're gonna head to dinner!
(chill music)
(chattering)
- Cabo!
- Cabo baby!
The bride to be.
This is what you have to do when you're
only traveling with a carryon.
You gotta wear all your
clothes and accessories.
(chill music)
Beautiful ladies!
Yes, Cabo!
Hello everybody!
We are officially in Cabo.
We are here for Emily's
bachelorette party,
and this is very exciting
because it is actually
my very first bachelorette
party, so this is incredible.
All the girls are here.
We've got these team bride necklaces.
We just took a little dip
at the pool, got some sun,
and now we're just gonna quickly
get ready to go to dinner!
I must say, April has been
very, very kind to me.
A lot of beautiful blessings,
and I love that I get to
spend time with some loved
ones, including this one!
Hello!
- Just redoing my makeup now.
- Are you starting all from the beginning?
- Yeah, I am, 'cause I wanna
do a nice orange eye, I think.
- Ooh, ooh!
An orange eye would be sick.
- You know?
So just taking this off with
the Garnier Micellar Water.
- For my look, I think I'm just
gonna do something really simple.
We'll see, I'm just gonna layer on top of
all this beat right now.
(chill music)
Well, we just made it to dinner.
We're eating at the El
Farallon, and it is incredible.
It is on a cliffside.
The weather feels
amazing and we can't wait
to get some food in our bellies!
(chill music)
Good morning, girls.
- Good morning!
- [Jenn] Yes.
We've got the Mexican breakfast,
got the American breakfast.
- We've got--
- And another--
- --the Mexican breakfast.
- --Mexican breakfast.
Ooh, let's dig in, ladies.
We're getting it started, Miss Cherie.
- Day two!
- Day two.
Are you experienced with
opening champagne bottles?
- Highly.
- You're my hero.
Steph's really good at
opening champagne bottles too.
It's a skill, for sure.
- Most of the time it's very
anticlimactic, but you know.
- Yeah, let's see--
- 'Cause you don't want it--
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- You don't want it explode
and you don't want it
to overflow either, 'cause
you just want it to open.
- Well, when it's not hot--
- Yes!
(pop)
Wow!
Woo!
Look how cute this sippy cup is!
We're gonna fill it up
with some champagne.
Hello, we are at the beach now.
This is Andrea.
Got our champagne in our
sippys, enjoying the sun.
♪ My heart belongs to you ♪
♪ My heart belongs to you ♪
♪ I'm telling you, yeah ♪
(chill music)
(screams)
So we're at the airport now.
- It's done.
- It's done, it's over!
- That was a really great
couple of days, yeah.
- I know.
This was one of the best
weekends of my life.
- Yeah, it really was!
- I'm so happy I got to be with my girls!
- Yeah.
Honestly, we thought that
because these two days
were not gonna be
enough, but it totally...
It was so action-packed.
- Yeah, every hour we were
doing something, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.
So it really perfect, it was awesome.
- The itinerary was perfect.
But yeah, back to reality.
Reality's not so bad either.
Long time, no see.
It's been a minute since I vlogged.
Took a couple days off,
but we're back on it.
Today I'm going to the gym.
Gonna do some cardio and
strength training, as usual.
(chill music)
Hi, can I get it light, please?
Thanks.
Ben got something very special today.
- I'm a very, very happy boy right now.
I treated myself to the Mavic Air Pro.
- [Jenn] Wow.
It is a drone.
- It's amazing.
As some of you guys know, I've
been flying a drone recently,
and it's Bingwa's, which
is very kind of him.
- [Jenn] Thank you, Wa!
- Thank you, Wa.
- You're amazing.
- He's the best.
And we've got the Mavic Air Pro.
Look how small this is.
- [Jenn] Wow, it's tiny!
- Look at it!
- [Jenn] Wow, compare it
to the size of your head.
Wow.
- It's very small and light.
I love the case as well.
It's got a nice case.
- Oh, that's so cool!
- Even little things like the controller,
they've got the detachable
little toggles there so you can
slide it in a pocket when
you're on a portable shoot.
It is absolutely lovely and
I'm very excited to fly this.
We're going to Singapore
tonight, so I need to get these
charged up so we can get some cool shots.
- Aerial shots.
Yeah, so tonight we are
heading to Singapore,
and so that's why we're just trying to get
as much work done as we possibly can.
I feel like April has been such
an intense month of traveling.
- [Ben] Just every time we finish
a trip or something, there's another one.
- There's another one.
- [Ben] Singapore jumped out of nowhere.
- I know, I'm so excited.
I'm doing a private meet
and greet where I get
to meet 50 of you guys and
I am so stoked, that way I
get to, you know, have each
moment with each of y'all.
We're gonna see if I can
squeeze in another 30 minutes
to get to see people who weren't able
to get into the private meet and greet.
Meet and greets can be a little tricky,
because any time you have a meet and greet
in a public space, you
need to have a permit,
or else they consider it a fire
hazard, you get kicked out,
and I've been kicked out multiple times,
so that's why I like it when a brand just
coordinates, organizes everything.
So yeah, I hope that
gives you more insight
on how these things work.
But yeah, right now I just
uploaded my Jenn Goes to
A Music Festival video.
I don't think I'll get
in trouble for this,
but basically, when we went to Coachella,
we weren't allowed to
legally say Coachella,
so that's why I had to title it that.
Please go check the cards to go watch it.
Ben edited it and it is so incredible.
I love it!
Okay, so I'm about to give Amy her gift
that I got from Mexico, and it took
so frickin' long to give it to you.
- Yeah.
- Okay, close your eyes, close
your eyes, close your eyes!
Oh yeah, Joan's here too.
- Yes, Joan's here.
- Hello.
- Gonna hang out all day.
Well, since two.
- That's two of the same cameras.
- Yeah.
- Jenn, did you see it too?
(mumbling)
- Okay, are you ready?
- What is it?
Flaming Hot Cheetos: Extra Hot?
Wait, this is Mexican!
- Mexian Hot Cheetos.
- Oh my god!
Hello!
Both cameras!
Oh my god!
Wait, this is gonna be
so spicy, I feel like.
- We'll see, but isn't that bag funny?
It's long.
- It's long and lean, just like how we
won't be after we eat these.
- I know, true, true, true.
- 'Cause Jenn and I have
been on a workout routine.
Okay, okay, can we try it?
- It's so exciting!
(laughing)
We had them at the airport.
- Oh my god, Jenn, they're
literally so powdered.
- These are really coated heavily.
- Yeah, there's no yellow.
No yellow friends.
- No yellow.
- Okay, I'm ready.
Okay, ready everyone?
- [All] Cheers!
- Whoa.
- It definitely tastes more
like an herb or spice in it,
more that chemicals.
(laughing)
Right?
- Yeah.
It's slightly more lemon-y, I feel.
I feel like they're a notch down
from the hot chili black, maybe?
- Yeah.
- Or maybe it needs to build.
Is this worth the wait?
- I know, I've literally
had 20 while you had two.
- No, I think I...
I don't know how many I've had,
but I've had quite a number.
These are so good!
- I know, thanks, Jenn!
- Yeah, of course!
Hey guys, so I am just
closing out the vlog.
I am currently still
editing, and I'm editing the
freakin' Hot Cheeto part,
which is the last clip
you're about to see, and ugh, I am craving
Hot Cheetos so badly.
I swear, it is like an addiction.
I see it, and I'm triggered, and then
I am desperate for them.
I am so happy that I got
to hang out with the girls
at Emily's Bachelorette.
Just editing that just
made me smile so much,
and I think one of these
reasons why I continue
to do these monthly vlogs
is really for myself,
because I can look back
at any moment in 2016,
2017, and now 2018 and
really relive what I did,
which is so cool.
It's like a visual diary.
And yeah, I'm really happy
that you guys enjoy them too.
I wanna thank you guys
so much for watching,
and I'll see you guys in the next one.
Bye!
