season and I've partnered with simple
skincare to show you two transformations
today Halloween can be a scary time for
your skin but simples products loving to
make up for all my makeup by putting the
good ingredients back into my skin
especially when I'm playing around with
kooky looks like these
alright so without further ado let's
turn into a panda my skin is already
clean and moisturized but I'm going to
add a primer because I want that face
paint to be as smooth as possible I'm
using this one by Tarte but there's a
ton of other great drugstore options you
can use as well
now grabbing Nyx's jumbo eye pencil in
black bean I'm going to start drawing in
a circular shape around my eyes I'm
going to take my time with this because
I want to be careful and precise as I
can once you have that circle down I'm
going to draw a little extension on the
end because panda eyes tend to have that
little droop there once that's done go
ahead and replicate that onto the other
eye and once you have two circular
shapes you're going to go off and start
coloring it all in it's totally fine to
be messy because we're going to set it
down with an eye shadow anyway
once you're done coloring I'm going to
grab this black sparkly eye shadow from
Maybelline and then with the brush I'm
just going to start packing down where
we did the eyeliner this is going to
make the black more opaque and it's
going to add a little sparkle so no
complaints here
once you're done let's grab that face
paint and then with my fingers I'm just
going to start applying this onto my
face I tried using a brush with this but
I quickly found out that it applies best
with your fingers now I'm just going to
quickly touch up around the eyes so I
can just neaten that all up alright
let's tackle that nose now I'm basically
just outlining the top of my nose giving
it that cute bear like nose then with
the same eyeliner I'm going to apply it
onto my lips because I'm just trying to
be resourceful
so I messed up a little on the nose
mouth connector so I just grabbed a
simple facial cleansing wipe and I redid
that section so that it's just a clean
line instead of that weird triangle
thing I did Oh much better now I'm just
going to finish this off by tightlining
using this Revlon Colorstay eyeliner so
just pop on that panda hat and you're
ready to roam around like a little bear
this is such an easy and cute costume
drop this
who doesn't love pandas so I'm going to
get started on to my second look now and
I'm going to need to take this all off
I'm grabbing simples dual effect eye
makeup remover as my first step and I'm
going to shake that bottle because this
is eight by phase formula i drenched my
cotton round and then i'm going to
gently press it onto my eye there's no
need for harsh rubbing it just dissolves
the makeup while being gentle on the
skin and the lashes seriously look at
these cotton rounds they're totally
black now that both of my eyes are clean
I'm going to go ahead and use simples
hydrating cleansing oil for the rest of
my face and I'm going to apply it
directly onto my dry skin I'm going to
start rubbing it in and the formula is
going to start acting immediately add a
little bit of water to really get it
going and then rinse with warm water now
my skin is clean and instantly hydrated
as you can see so I'm just going to get
started on to my second transformation
for foundation I'm using Maybelline's
fit me foundation I'm going to dot this
all across my face and I used a
foundation shade a little lighter than
my natural skin tone because I wanted
that milky pale porcelain base now we're
going to set that by using a powder I'm
using this one from NARS but you can
definitely use a translucent powder from
the drugstore next up we're going to
draw on the brows I'm using this one
from benefit and I'm just gonna start
drawing them in like I normally do this
doesn't have to be too perfect because
believe me when you have this look on
the last thing people are going to
notice are your brows I'm using Nyx's
jumbo eye pencil in milk and I'm going
to apply that all over the lid this is
going to be your much-needed base now
I'm going to bust out my trusty lorac
Pro palette this guy's definitely seen
better days I'm going to grab white and
then I'm going to pop that on where we
applied the white base then using sable
I'm going to apply it right over the
white to give myself a larger crease
then with the fluffier brush I'm going
to blend blend blend until it looks
seamless to add more dimension I'm using
espresso which is a dark brown I'm going
to pop that on to my outer crease just
to deepen the eyes and then we're done
I'm grabbing my Kat Von D tattoo liner
and I'm going to start drying in a
super-sharp wing to both eyes there's
nothing subtle about this look then I'm
going to grab some black eyeshadow and
with a smudge brush I'm going to give
myself a cup crease to
my eyes more dull like it might look a
little harsh like this so make sure you
give it a good old blend before you move
on let's widen those eyes even more by
using milk and tight lining the entire
lower eye this is an illusion that's
going to make your eyes look like they
begin here now next up grab your liquid
liner and draw in your new eyes shape
make sure you use a light hand with this
and it is not perfect it's okay because
we're going to draw on some fake lashes
which are going to hide any
imperfections you made now I'll feel
free to add some mascara or you can be
like me and pop buns and falsies your
choice I'm using elfs warm bronzer
palette and I'm going to start brushing
on some cheekbones I want to make them
really pop then I'm going to drag some
of that bronzer onto the apples of my
cheeks to make them more circular and
doll-like
then to finish off this contour I'm
going to do my nose and make it more
narrow for blush I'm using this blush
quad from ELF and I'm using this bright
pink tone on the top left and I'm going
to be very generous with this dolls
usually have really bright cheeks so
that's what I'm going to do I gotta have
my glow so I'm using Becca's champagne
pop and I'm going to dust this all over
the tops of my cheeks and this is going
to give me that plastic sheen for my lip
color I'm using poppy peach and I'm
applying that all over the lips to match
my blush so the makeup is pretty much
done but now it's the moment of truth
the cracked portion using the same black
liquid liner I'm going to dive in by
drawing in the first crack on the face
the first line is always kind of
nerve-racking but the trick is just to
relax and realize that it looks better
when the lines aren't too perfect when
you look at shattered glass you'll
notice that it routes from one focal
point so once you figure out where that
is start making even smaller lines that
connect to the larger ones definitely
have a photo of some cracked glass or
feel free to use this tutorial to have
on hand if you need any extra help
placing the cracks next I'm just going
to start shading some of the lines to
make it pop and give it more definition
alright I'm going to grab this white
eyeliner from Too Faced and I'm going to
outline some of the cracks only on one
side this is going to make the entire
look pop and make it look even more 3d
you don't have to be too meticulous with
this because this is just an optical
and it's gonna look best from far away
anyway once you're done this is what you
should look like cracked shattered and
totally awesome alright guys so that was
my take on two Halloween looks I decided
to give you one cute one and one creepy
one just to give you some variety
I love October because this is the month
where you can truly express yourself in
whatever shape or form that you want and
I'm so happy that simple skincare allows
me to make up for all this makeup that I
apply on my face especially this time of
