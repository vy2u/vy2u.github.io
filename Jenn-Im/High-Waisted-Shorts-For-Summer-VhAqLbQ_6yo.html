out a few of my favorite high-waisted
shorts to sell for you guys let's start
off with the fanciest of the bunch these
are my embellished and luxurious shorts
covered in delicate white sequins now
there's plenty of ways to style these
lavish little things but I chose to wear
them in a really tripped out way this
sleeveless and fitted tank is totally a
statement piece
it makes your top kind of look like an
optical illusion which is probably the
reason why I like it to be honest I
don't think fashion should be taken
seriously you should wear stuff that
makes you laugh or boost your mood and
the haters can dismiss themselves I
wanted to have white accents all around
so I stepped into my white platforms and
I topped the look off with my flower
crown to brighten up the entire outfit
now I think pleather can be worn
year-round but for more months I like to
especially aim for lighter shades like
these ivory ones and I like the cutouts
because they add some awesome texture
and I guess I was going for kind of a
formal party look with the blazer and
underneath I'm just wearing white on
white it's something that I find myself
doing really often and to accessorize
I just went bold and picked out a gold
necklace in the shape of Medusa's head
and for shoes I'm wearing these ultra
chic black pointed boots there are more
of a fall and autumn boot in my taste
but I think they'll work for a wild
summer night out
my next pair are these daisy dukes I
love that these shorts are that true
blue denim color and the distressed
parts and the thighs are a nice touch i
styled these shorts with an oversized
white cardigan and I just rolled the
sleeves to give it more shape and
underneath I picked out this white
sleeveless button-down with this sick
embroidery and since it's summer I'm
wearing my middle list black strap heels
from Zara any other time of the year I'd
probably wearing some crazy chunky boots
and lastly I popped on the sloppy hat to
add some Western appeal I guess polka
dots are a classic print for summer and
when you're wearing something with dots
it's kind of hard not to stand out
that's why I toned these statement
bottoms with pretty much all neutral
colors I'm wearing this oversized taupe
tank that I thrifted and to make things
more casual I thought I'd wear my
Tripoli's because they have this awesome
metal link
stacked on them which coordinated really
well with this shaped metal necklace and
then I finished off the look with a
suicidal tendencies hat
I'm really happy you made it this far
because here's a little sneaky giveaway
runway bandits is actually giving away
this entire outfit which is this cute
floral crop top I think it's called the
ditzy floral Perez which i think is a
really cute name and these shorts and
just stay tuned in the end to figure out
how you can learn these pieces anyway I
wore some neutral platforms and then
some oversized sunglasses to style the
pieces with
all right so I'm gonna finish off the
slew of outfits with the classic
high-waisted shorts these fit like a
glove and are perfectly distressed on
the bottom and I styled this with a
lightweight summery crochet cardigan to
add a layer to my outfit and then I
busted out another psychedelic top to
just spice everything up and just a
question do you think I should do is
telling my psychedelic prints because
recently I've been racking up a lot of
them and I just think they're really fun
to style anyway for shoes I'm just
wearing my beat-up gerdes and whenever I
wear this bandanna I feel like a fusion
of Tupac and Sailor Moon so I guess that
makes me their dupe all right
