- Hi, everyone, it's ya girl, Jenn,
and I'm so happy that the holiday
season is officially here.
This is my favorite time of year
because there is so much going on,
like parties, lots of
food, and just more reasons
to get dolled up or stay cozy.
Today, I'm gonna be talking about
the newest additions to Eggie,
which is my clothing line.
If you guys are interested
in any of the other
collections that I've created,
head on over to the cards.
I'll leave them up there.
But let me focus on this drop.
I wanted to create pieces that would
just reflect any type of situation
you might find yourself this time of year
and I'm so excited to just go through
every item, piece by piece,
so let's get started.
So I'm gonna start with dresses first.
Here is the Lady's in Chain slip.
I wanted to put in something
super glam for all the ladies
who just want to shine on New Year's Eve
or any holiday event.
If you want to channel your inner Samantha
from Sex in the City, this is your dress.
It's in this really
slinky, satin material and
just the chains, it is so industrial
and I love how it contrasts with such a,
like, a feminine fabric.
I highly recommend this black dress
if you don't have a little black dress
already in your closet, this
could be the one for you.
During this time of year,
there are a lot of options
for shindigs and parties,
and so I wanted to create
another going out look.
This is a set.
This is Trunchbull top
and the Trunchbull skirt
and I named it after Miss
Trunchbull from Matilda.
She is the boss, takes no crap from anyone
and this outfit just kind
of embodied that for me.
This set definitely
exudes, like, professional,
demanding vibes because
of the pinstripe pattern.
But in order to not make is so stuffy,
I thought that these nice
exposure details in the middle
would really lighten it
up and make it shine.
I love this set and I
like that even though
I'm technically covered
up, it still feels sensual
because it's so bodycon.
Next up I have the Miss Honey dress,
which is named after the
sweet and nurturing teacher
from Matlida.
Basically, the complete
opposite of the Trunchbull,
but yeah, this is just a
really sweet and modest
yet chic dress that you can rock
to maybe, like, a family dinner,
meeting the parents, or church.
I just wanted to create
something that was longer
because I know I have a lot
of miniskirts and minidresses,
so this is a nice, fresh
silhouette that you guys can rock.
It's midi- but in case you
want to show some extra skin,
you can pop open a couple
buttons and flash that leg.
I must mention that it also has pockets.
I wanted to make sure that my ladies
had somewhere to put their
hands during awkward situations
or maybe you just need
somewhere to store your phone.
Basically, pockets are
always a great option
and this dress has it.
Next up is the Delilah dress.
This dress has got a really nice,
thick, substantial material to it
and I just love anything off the shoulder,
so this is perfect for those of you
who want to show a little decolletage.
I'm also a huge fan of polka dots
because they're just a timeless print.
I love billowy sleeves and I feel like
this dress really plays
with your proportions
in all the best ways.
The last dress I have is
the Queen of Diamonds slip.
This is just like your
traditional slip silhouette
but with a very contemporary
checkered print.
It has this black lace
trimming on the front
and the bottom and it just adds
a nice feminine detail to it.
For a night out, I would
wear this just on its own
with a red lip and earrings,
but if I wanted to just
make it more casual,
you could just throw a sweater over it.
All right, so let's move
on over to outerwear.
Here is the Holiday Cozy cardigan.
This is a remake of the
Cozy Cardigan from drop one,
but we made a couple
of different additions.
For example, the fabric is a lot softer.
It's in this really nice, buttery knit.
We've also made it a vibrant red,
which is perfect for the holidays.
And, lastly, we've added pockets.
The Cozy Cardigan was
one of our best sellers,
so I thought that we would create just one
with some modifications and
something that is really festive.
Also, I feel like even after Christmas,
this cardigan can be worn in the spring
because red is still having
a huge moment right now.
So this next jacket is
hands down my favorite.
This is the I'll Be Back anorak
and I love the fact that I
could see anybody rocking this.
It's definitely the most unisex piece.
It's in this sick camo print
with checkered detailing
all over the sleeves.
It's also very oversized.
What I'm wearing right now is a small,
so you can really layer any piece with it.
It's kind of like your modern-day cape
if you were, like, a
superhero or something.
That's where I actually got the name.
It is a nod to the Terminator
when he says, &amp;quot;I'll be back.&amp;quot;
I feel like he'd be wearing this anorak.
The last jacket I have is the Luna hoodie.
This is so luxurious and soft.
This honestly feels
like I'm petting Cheeki.
It's so soft but it's faux fur.
This is a cropped zip-up hoodie
with gold chain detailing.
It also has a cute little E
for Eggie charm at the end.
This also this satin lining
and it feels really good
to slip into and I'm wearing a size large
because I just wanted something
that was more oversized,
something that I could just, you know,
chuck on over anything, but if you want
something more fitted, definitely
go for the smaller sizes.
So the last category is tops
and so I'm gonna talk about
the sweater that I'm rocking right now.
This is the Salmon Stripe sweater.
This is just your every day cozy sweater.
You can wear it to class.
You can wear it home.
You can wear it to the grocery store.
I thought I would just play around
with the stripe sizing by having some
fat stripes on the chest and
some thin stripes on the sleeves.
It's just a really
quirky, every day sweater
that you might love.
Next up I have the Hot and Cold turtleneck
and I named it this because
even though it's in a
traditional turtleneck silhouette
that's supposed to keep you
warm, it will not do that
because it's in this mesh material.
Basically, I would say that
this has no functionality to it
but it's purely for the aesthetic
and I live for pieces like this.
This is definitely a look.
I would rock this layered with dresses
or overalls or something, or,
if you're just gonna wear it
on its own, I would recommend
wearing a black bodysuit
or a black bralette.
The last top I have is the Check Mate tank
and this silhouette is pretty similar
to the Lady's in Chains
dress because it has that
same draping effect on the front.
I feel like this is really flattering
and it's also in that really
luxurious satin material.
I love this fabric
because it just makes you
feel like a million bucks.
So that is a wrap on the haul.
I hope you guys enjoyed the pieces.
I honestly had so much fun
designing this capsule collection
and I can't wait to see how
all these pieces look like on you.
If you would like to follow
our Instagram @eggieshop,
feel free to do so, there's a
lot more inspiration on there.
If you're interested in the pieces,
head on over to eggie.us
and I'll also leave a link
in the downbar, so please check that out.
I want to thank you guys
so much for watching.
I'm gonna head out because
this lighting is horrendous.
I need to make a note
to myself not to film
past 2:30 because the light
just gets progressively worse.
Anyway, I hope you guys
are having a beautiful day
and I'll see you guys in the next one.
Bye!
