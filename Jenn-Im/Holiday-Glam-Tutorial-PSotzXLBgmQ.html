so I'm starting off with the clean and
moisturize face and then using tartes
Amazonian clay foundation because it's
my absolute favorite I'm going to use
Maybelline instant age rewind dark
circles not only do like to use under my
eyes I like to use it as a highlighter
for my nose I've noticed that after I
blend it does make kind of a slight
difference next up I'm going to powder
my face to seal in all the product also
powder is a really good way to stay
matte and not oily and since we're
applying a lip color today I'm going to
use a moisturizing lip balm so when I
get to my lips they should be ready to
go
moving on to eyebrows I'm using one of
my Holy Grail products which is on Asajj
EOS brow Wiz as you can see I wasn't
blessed in the eyebrow department so I'm
just gonna draw them in I've been
rocking the straight brow of this year
so I thought I might as well just end
the year with my brows straight now that
the other brow is complete I'm going to
use a spoolie on the other edge of the
pen and I'm just going to run it through
my brows to make it look natural and
blend it all in now for the last step
I'm going to use a tinted brow gel to
have it match the color of my hair and
to have the hairs stay in place moving
on to my favorite part the eye makeup
I'm gonna prep my lids with the best
primer in the world and I'm going to dab
and blend a small amount all around my
lids
my eyeshadow needs a base so I'm going
to use Nyx's yoghurt for the inner third
of my eyes you can pretty much use any
cream eyeshadow stick that's in a light
color this is just gonna make your
shadows come off more vibrant and have
it last longer from my Naked 2 palette
I'm grabbing booty-call which is a
slightly shimmery cream color and then
I'm going to apply it only to the corner
of my eyes then going into my Urban
Decay vice
palette I'm taking shellshock and
applying it to my inner thirds of my
eyelids and shellshock is just a very
rich silver color which I thought was
going to be perfect for the holidays
next using any dark brown matte
eyeshadow start creating a white cat eye
it's not crucial that it's perfect
because you're going to spend the rest
of your time blending it out
regardless try your best to make it as
symmetrical as you can and blend and
blend and blend until you're satisfied
with it to intensify the eyes I'm using
poison and applying it to the outer
thirds of my eyes this one is kind of a
blackish greenish color and I thought it
was going to be the perfect one just use
it to smoke it out I actually use two
liquid liners first I use steel as
eyeliner to draw the gist of the wing
the felt tip works really well for a
couple weeks and then it just kind of
dries out so you can't make a clear
precise line and that is where the urban
decay liner kicks in I use this to
really define the wing and make it more
dramatic and clean the problem with this
is that this brush is so thin that it
takes you forever to draw a thick line
so that's why I just use both in
combination here's the part you've been
waiting for the glitter you can use a
silver glitter eyeliner and apply it to
the silver portion of your eye you can
add as little or as much as you'd like I
love using a liquid liner instead of a
powder because there's no mess or
fallout I promise that this eyeliner is
more sparkly in real life the camera
isn't really doing it justice which
really bums me out now it's time for
lashes I've been using Lancome's eyelash
primer to really get the length I want
for my lashes I usually add around two
to three coats with this but the key is
that you have to let it dry so while we
wait for the product to dry and finish
I'm just going to start contouring my
face with Nyx's sunny
then I'm going to add my favorite blush
to add a flush of color to my cheeks now
that the primer is dry I'm going to use
Maybelline falsies mascara in the
waterproof formula I'm going to apply
that all over my lashes and the bottom
ones too then taking a brown eyeliner
pencil you're going to just connect the
wing to the bottom portion of your eye
but you're not going to want to go too
far just maybe 25% like 1/4 of your eye
for that glowy and glam look it is
essential that you highlight your face
I'm using benefits Watts up and I'm
going to apply it to the bridge of my
nose as well as my cheekbones and I'm
just gonna blend it in all with my
fingers so you can totally rock a nude
lip with this eye look but I'm going to
take it to the next level with a dark
and vampy lip take the darkest red lip
liner and line your lips this step is
really important because if you don't
line them the product is just going to
feather out and you don't want that and
as you can see my darkest red lip liner
is portside which isn't that dark at all
but whenever I didn't have time to go
out and buy a really dark lip liner but
it doesn't matter because I'm just going
to apply OCC's black dahlia lip tar all
over it this is probably the most
intense step ever because applying this
product is so difficult you really need
a steady hand and it takes a lot of
patience but the end result is totally
totally worth it
so the makeup is finished and we're
going to move on to hair this is my day
to hair so it's the luminous and kind of
gritty and I'm going to freshen it up by
using my favorite thickening dry shampoo
just section off pieces of your hair and
spray the dry shampoo as far away as you
can
and after you've sprayed all the little
sections you're just going to rub in the
product throughout your scalp and that's
going to give the volume that you want
now that we're finished and it's feeling
clean you're going to want to section
off your hair and we're going to use a
curling wand to really frame some pieces
and for this part because I have short
hair it really doesn't matter how
perfect these curls are because this is
simply just to help with the texture
you can just curl random sections of it
and after you're finished you can just
spray it with some hairspray to keep it
locked in place now moving on to the
next section of your hair you're just
going to want to call it the same way
you did it as the first section it's
pretty much the same thing there's
really no rhyme or reason to it you just
grab a piece of hair and curl it and you
just move on the last section is where
it kind of matters because this is where
you're going to make that awesome flip
with your hair
just make sure you curl the hair away
from your face so that way it frames it
beautifully then you can curl other
parts of your hair that you think need
fixing now that you're done you're gonna
grab the curls and even break them apart
and just kind of fix it until you start
liking the way it looks then get out of
your PJs and wear something super glam
and sparkly I think this look is perfect
for New Year's or just a night out on
the town
it's vampy it's sexy and very inviting
