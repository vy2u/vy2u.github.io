today's video is going to be about
self-confidence I know a lot of you guys
are under the impression that I'm a
confident person and I would say at this
point in my lives
yes I am confident in myself I'm happy
and secure obviously I still have my
insecurities I'm human but they don't
consume me like they did when I was
younger and I would say that this whole
confidence thing really came maybe the
past four to five years so all these
life lessons are pretty fresh so I
thought I would share them with you so
let's get started so my first role is to
stop judging other people this is number
one because I think it's the most
important and if you don't apply this to
your life already apply it today I feel
like this day and age it's so easy to
put someone down and say nasty comments
like oh why what you are that that's
like my number one pet peeve is when
people talk about what other people
are wearing
I feel like fashion especially everyone
has the right to wear whatever that they
want so let's say like we're at a club
and someone says something stalking
about what other girl is wearing that
really grinds my gears like I don't like
that I feel like whether someone wants
to wear like a fishnet bodysuit or
sweats every day that's their
prerogative and it does not affect your
life whatsoever and if you are about to
talk smack about someone pause for a
second and think about whether it
affects your life in any way if it
doesn't let it go it really doesn't
matter when you are hard on other people
you're harder on yourself talking smack
about someone else isn't going to bring
them down to your level it's not and
have you ever noticed that the people
that have the most
are the most painfully insecure other
let's just leave it at that so the next
time you're about to badmouth someone or
judge someone just realize that it's a
cheap form of conversation or song so my
next tip is for those people that get a
little nervous when they're walking in
public or they're afraid of being stared
at so when I walk in public
I literally just look straight ahead I
don't make any eye contact with people I
just literally walk my direction because
when I was younger I was always really
paranoid about the looks that people
would give me I'd be like oh like why do
they look at me did you think that
that I look stupid you think I was dumb
and all these things all these stops
were rushing to my head and make me feel
even more insecure so my solution was to
literally stop looking at other people
and continue just walking my way and
I've come to realize that if people are
looking at you
number one chances are it's not really
negative Oh number two they're probably
looking at you because you looked at
them I don't know I just like to avoid
that situation all together so I don't
make any eye contact when I'm walking on
the street and I just look straight
ahead tip number three is to listen to a
badass playlist like most people music
has a huge impact on my life and don't
underestimate the power of music it can
really change you so when I was in
college when I would wear like a crazy
outfit something really bold I would
just put on my playlist walk straight
ahead and it would literally be like I
was in my own world definitely take the
time out to curate your own badass
playlist put all the bangers in their
stuff that makes your heart pound stuff
that makes you feel powerful and
confident it's so important I am going
to leave a link to my playlist that
makes me feel confident in the downbar
just be warned it's going to be a random
school song
but each song is really near and dear to
my heart you can see like I don't know I
have like random tapes and music and
also if you guys have a confidence like
song that makes you feel amazing
put in the comments down below because I
would love to listen to it tip number
four is to expand yourself to stretch
yourself I think it's so important
because if you want to grow you're going
to have to stretch and when you stretch
it's going to hurt a little bit but
that's the only way you're going to grow
for example when I was younger I was
terrified of driving like literally so
anxious on the road like my heart would
beat really fast and there were some
times where I just like wouldn't even go
to certain places because I didn't want
to drive but fortunately I had a call
from my fears and when I lived in Davis
and I wanted to go home I to drive six
hours down so that caused it driving
over and over and over again just made
me more comfortable with the road
I wasn't scared about switching lanes
anymore and honestly if I can tell my 19
year old self now that I would be
completely fine on the road with no
anxiety I would have been floored
literally stop avoiding stuff they don't
want to do because it's so important for
you the more you do something
easier it becomes my last life lesson is
you will grow into who you are as long
as you absorb so my senior quote in high
school was be yourself everyone else is
taken by Oscar Wilde and this was a
mantra that I really fixated on and I
just kind of obsessed over because at
the time I didn't know who I was and I
desperately just wanted to be me but I
didn't know who I was yet and now that I
look back it is perfectly fine to not
know who you are it is a gradual pressed
process and everyone has different times
on when they start becoming comfortable
with themselves but all you got to do to
get to that process is just absorb as
much as you can I feel like the world is
just like a big chaotic place with tons
of different information just swinging
at you and your brain is just like a sip
that's like catching as much as it can
and what comes out of the sift it all
just like goes in a big pot and it
marinates and what isn't that pot like
that's your soul that's who you are and
the only way you know who you are is by
absorbing as much and experience
experiencing as much stuff as you can so
don't hold back watch those movies
you've always wanted to watch talk to
those people wear what you want to wear
go to those concerts watch those
documentaries listen to podcast I'm
literally just saying everything that's
coming in my mind now is the time to
develop your interest and it's so
important to do that because that is
going to really shape who you are and I
think it's a beautiful thing because in
the end we're all just like little bits
and pieces of everything that we've ever
experienced and I think that is such a
beautiful thing this is just a process
that I would just want everyone to start
on because it's so important and such a
gift to really be comfortable with
yourself and it's something that
everyone can achieve okay guys so those
were my five life lessons that I've
learned to be more comfortable with
myself I know I probably missed a lot of
other tips that I could have
incorporated so you guys should
definitely write in the comments down
below what is made you a happier person
was made you more confident I would love
to just make the comment section of big
just like open forum I want to let you
guys know that I appreciate you so much
and this channel would be nothing
without
you and I want to film more of these
like advice videos but I never want to
come off too preachy because I don't
have the answers for everything I really
go I really don't have answers to
anything at all but I just wanted to
share with you guys just some
information that I have learned myself
and anything that I learn I want to
share with you guys because you guys are
really important to me so I hope you
guys have a beautiful day and I'll see
you guys in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
