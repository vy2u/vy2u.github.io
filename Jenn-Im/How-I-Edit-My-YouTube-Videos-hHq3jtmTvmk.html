and today I'll be showing you how I edit
my YouTube videos I've been creating
videos for a number of years now and I
thought that today I would just kind of
guide you on what goes on in my head as
I'm editing and I know I do like a wide
range of videos but today I thought I
would just show you how I do it basic
vlogs that I keep it simple and
informational also if you are not
subscribed by now please do button is
down below hit that and become a gem
today alright so with that said let's
get started
alrighty so here is my desktop I'm going
to open up Final Cut Pro 10 this is what
I've been using for years now and it's
what I like
I have already imported my files and now
I'm going to create a new project this
one is called Jun blog 2017 for now and
all my clips are in there and ready to
go so my first step is to create a rough
cut I like to make sure that I have all
the right clips in order and have them
chronological so I just drag each clip
and bring it down and I'll start piling
them all down where they belong it just
helps me keep organized and keeps me
sane I know some people just like to
work it like little by little I just
like to dump it all at once and trim as
I go once you have established the
positioning I just kind of scrub through
the footage and I try my best to get rid
of any lumps or gaps like in this clip
I'm just rambling so I'm just using the
blade tool and I'm just going to cut
that out no one needed to hear me
remember if it was Tuesday or Wednesday
I just have found it best to keep your
dialogue as effective as you can all
right so let's talk about transition now
when I'm jumping to one scene to another
I'll go into transitions and then I'll
use slide I like to use slide when I'm
transitioning in the same day but when
it's a new day I'll go in with flash
which is in the light section and it
will just kind of burst and I'll
indicate that it's a new day
once all the clips are in place and I'm
happy with the rough cut I'll just match
the clips to the beat of a song you can
develop a relationship with a music
artist and agree to have their music on
your channel I'm really lucky that I've
made friends it's go Yama and DJ grumble
and we have an agreement with the usage
another way is to get songs from a
royalty-free library
there is a lot out there but my favorite
it's epidemic sound believe me I've gone
through a lot the quality of their music
library is bomb I've summed through so
many music libraries where everything
just sounds like crap but I find
epidemic sounds library to have such a
wide range of genres and artists one of
my favorite artists there is Epsilon
probably saying that wrong but I love
what he produces it really goes well
with my channel and creates a great vibe
it just feels good knowing that these
songs are a hundred percent safe you
don't have to worry about copyright
claims there's a 30 day free trial for
all new users to sign up and start
browsing the music so now that I got my
song I'm going to work on the intro I'm
going to go to library drag this song in
and this is where you can add cool text
effects with fonts personally I have a
graphic designer that I work with and
she creates these awesome images for me
that I can overlay with this is not
necessary by any means though you can
find a cool font on a ton of websites
my favorite is dafont.com and here's a
few of my favorite fonts to you know
help you start out also there is always
pixel film studios I feel like this is
like a well-known YouTube secret but you
can just buy plug-ins here that just
jazz up your videos with minimal editing
now back to the intro I'm just going to
throw in some fun stuff I'm going to put
a little TV static to make it seem like
you're like tiling into a new episode so
now that my intro is looking good I'm
going to start adding music to all the
montages in my videos I'll try and make
the clips change every time when it hits
a beat it just makes the viewing
experience a little cooler more artsy I
know some people won't notice but at
least you'll know that it's there now
that the music is done I'm going to go
ahead and add the dates I always make
sure I put my snapping option on because
this always make sure that the graphics
on top synchronized with the clip on the
bottom so you see that yellow line it
snaps back in that indicates that it's
like perfectly aligned now I'll go back
to the blog and I'll stop at every clip
where a new location is established for
example here's a clip of VidCon I'm
going to put a basic text on it I'm
going to write VidCon because this was
at VidCon and I'm going to change the
font to my favorite Brandon I'm going to
make it bold and I'm going to just space
out
text a little bit to make it look cooler
I know it's like obvious that it's
VidCon but it's little details like this
that make the vlog more fun and just
keep the viewer stimulated the last
thing I'll do is add an end slate this
is a landing page for you to write any
of your socials or where your viewers
can find you this also isn't necessary
but I just find that it adds a nice
professional touch make sure it's at
least 20 seconds long because that's
what YouTube recommends alright guys
that is just a brief outline of what
goes on in my head as I'm editing
obviously finding your own video and
editing style comes with time and
experience and you just got to be
consistent and things will just kind of
fall into place it took me a very long
time to get to where I am now and
there's still so many things like I need
to learn but regardless creating videos
is such a fun and just good outlet
especially if you're the type of person
that likes a document and just remember
memories if you enjoyed the video please
hit the like button and also open the
description box the link for the
epidemic sound deal is there music is
such a key factor in YouTube videos and
it's just good to be safe so please open
that check it out and thank you so much
for watching I'll see you guys in the
next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
