It's your girl, Jenn.
And today, I am doing a
really fun styling video.
Since it's finally starting
to get cold around here,
I thought I would bust out
some of my outerwear pieces
and show you guys how I style them.
I am so happy to announce that I have
partnered with Nordstrom Rack
who is sponsoring this video.
They have such a great
selection of outerwear,
so it was really fun
getting to make this video.
I also filmed a video on
their YouTube channel,
so make sure you check that
out after you watch mine.
But for this video, I
am styling three looks,
so let's get started.
The first coat I'm styling
is the puffer coat.
Puffer coats are
notorious for being bulky,
but that's why I decided to choose one
that's more elongated.
I love that this is in
a neutral olive shade,
so it's really easy to pair
with anything in my closet.
I went ahead and styled it
with a gray turtleneck sweater,
and then I streamlined with
some simple, black skinnies
for something chic and classic.
For shoes, I'm wearing
some classic black boots.
And then I wore a beanie
to cover up any bedhead.
I think this is a really
great, everyday jacket
that you can rock to school or
running errands around town.
Nordstrom Rock has a ton
of amazing puffer options,
so make sure you check it out.
This next outfit is how I
would rock a faux fur coat.
I found this color one at Nordstrom Rack,
and I love that it's reversible.
So it's like you're
getting two coats in one.
Since the coat is on the
more extravagant side,
I'm going to show you how I rock this baby
in the evening for a date night look.
I popped on the coat, and I'm showing off
the white faux fur side.
I feel like it gives off a more chic,
winter wonderland vibe.
Underneath, I'm wearing a cute, lace dress
and then paired it with
some over-the-knee boots
for a cozy winter feel.
This is a great look to wear to a concert
or even a nice dinner.
I also styled these boots over at
the Nordstrom Rack
channel, so if you'd like
to get more ideas on how to style it,
definitely go check it out.
I'll leave it in the cards
and the description box.
The next coat is perfect for those
who are traveling for the holidays.
I highly recommend getting a bomber jacket
because they're so multifaceted
and can be worn for so many occasions.
Here I have this really
sick, black bomber.
It's so comfortable, and it has
this cool graphic on the back.
So this is how I styled the bomber
to wear at the airport.
I paired the jacket with a comfy hoodie
and some sweats.
This is like a really chilled out look,
and it's insanely comfortable.
So that way, you can travel in leisure.
Now here is how I wear the
bomber for the evening.
I paired it with a patterned,
over-the-shoulder top
and my navy disco pants.
This is a flashy ensemble you can wear
to a house party or drinks with the girls.
So, yeah, that's why I
love bombers so much.
They're light-weight, easy to pack,
and really go with any occasion.
All right, guys, those
are my three outfits
featuring outerwear pieces.
If you'd like more fashion inspiration,
head on over to Nordstrom
Rack's YouTube channel.
I filmed something on there.
I will leave a link in
the description box,
so please check it out.
You can also shop similar
styles on Nordstrom Rack.
They are having an additional
30 percent off sale
on Black Friday, so if
you love a good deal,
make sure you right in your calendars.
Please let me know what other items
you'd like me to style in future videos
in the comments down below.
I love reading what you guys have to say.
And yeah, thank you so much for watching,
and I'll see you guys in the next one.
Bye!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
