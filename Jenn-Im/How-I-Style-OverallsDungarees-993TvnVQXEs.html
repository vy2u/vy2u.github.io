style overalls or dungarees as some of
you in the UK call it this video is
perfect for you initially I thought it
was pretty hard styling them because I
always felt like they came off too
juvenile or youthful or kind of like a
farmer but after playing around with a
few silhouettes I think I have nails the
way I personally like to style them so
stay tuned the first idea is with a crop
top and I like mine to be fitted because
overalls come off as slightly shapeless
anyway and my top is from brandy
melville and I just love standard fit of
it I think it works as a perfect
foundation because it's neutral enough
to complement the statement factor
within my overalls if I had to name this
outfit it'd be disco farmer and the
disco would come from the sparkles from
my cardigan and these shoes are kind of
reminiscent of like a night on the town
and the farmer would come with this
concho hat which has a lot of Western
appeal to it
my next face is an off-the-shoulder top
when you're wearing something that
reveals your shoulders the look
instantly becomes a little bit more
sultry and daring and I got this top
from Lulu's and it was actually a long
sleeve top but I cut the sleeves off to
make it into something short for the
summer it's actually a reoccurring
problem that happens every summer I end
up just chopping off the sleeves to all
my shirts which just kind of bites me in
the ass when the winter comes back
anyway I think that the maturity of the
top just tones down the youthful factor
of my short hauls and because I have an
unhealthy obsession with hats I had to
add my cat from stylenanda and I went
for some cream converse to make the
outfit totally casual and perfect for
strutting around during the day
if you don't have a bralette by now
you're seriously missing out because
they act as really great bases for a lot
of clothing situations and I like
wearing bra let's under long overalls
for instances where I want to keep my
arms free and uncovered and I think
sometimes it's okay to skip the
middleman and just go all out with the
bralette because when it's done
tastefully it just looks like you're
wearing a camisole and this paisley
overall was actually a little bit too
revealing so I thought the bra that
added as a good cover-up to add more
shape to my look I added my trusty
goodwill belt and then I slipped into my
middle most heels from Zara to keep they
look very simple and clean and yep I
added another hat because it just didn't
look right without one
a white button-down comes in handy when
you want to dress up a pair of overalls
anything with a collar just instantly
add structure and formality to an outfit
and plus I think they just look
incredible with overalls and I really
like this particular style because of
the way it button downs just like a
shirt instead of just having like those
clasps on the side and I'm wearing my
Jeffrey Campbell gladiators to keep up
with the summer theme of my outfits
this next look is just a really fancy
evening look featuring overalls and I
wanted to include this because I'm
really happy with the way I styled it
these pair of overalls were actually
just way too big on me the straps were
ridiculously long so I just tied them
around my neck to make it into a sexy
halter and since the waist wasn't
connected to the straps I added a fix
that belt to hold the outfit together
and I added a Zodiac bracelet that I
turned into an armlet by pushing it up
on my arm
and then I wore my black pumps or
Marshalls to take this evening look to
the next level
so that was how I style overalls or
dungarees please comment down below and
let me know what your favorite outfit
was or tell me how you Stalin because I
think it would be a really good place to
bounce off ideas on how do you style
this difficult pair of clothing my
Instagram is I'm genom if you want to
show me how you style overalls or
dungarees you should use the hashtag I'm
random or close encounters whatever you
prefer I just know that if you do the @
sign I am NOT going to find it because
it just gets flooded with the amount of
notifications I get so if you hatched a
git then I will definitely see it and I
like it and maybe I'll leave a comment
back alright so I'll see you my next one
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
