today's video is about posing for photos
I know it can feel pretty awkward and
daunting getting your picture shaken but
it doesn't always have to feel that way
this is why I've whipped up ten of my
go-to poses so it just makes life easier
in front of the camera and if you enjoy
videos like this make sure you subscribe
B button is down below so join the
family
alright so without further ado let's get
on with the poses so my first pose is
called the lean and this one is super
easy all you going to do is find a wall
and weaned on it you can lean on it
sideways for something more laid-back
and chill or you can lean on it just
directly for something that's more
straightforward but my little pro tip is
to kind of arch your back and pop your
butt out a little bit and have that
resting on the wall it looks really
weird from the side but directly it just
Slim's you down and makes you look good
pose number two is called the crossing
and this is when you have your legs
crossed
I find that when my legs are crossed the
pose looks a lot more dynamic as opposed
to just having my legs just parallel
next to each other I feel like the pose
looks a little flat that way but when
you've got it crossed I mean I feel like
it elongate your figure and it's just
more flattering to your body
I'm not wearing heels I always make sure
to tiptoe those two extra inches goes a
long way and when you are tiptoeing
you're flexing your legs so it looks
leaner and elongate your body the next
mode is called the strut and pretty much
like the previous pose but you're
actually walking so instead of just
having one leg over the other you're
actually going to give yourself a little
one cheese step
I find that when you when you try and
physically walk it's hard for the
photographer to capture that moment so I
do like a little rocking motion to try
and capture that shot it looks really
dumb in your life but I swear when you
get the photo it's totally going to be
worth it I find that the most difficult
part about the strut for some reason is
I always blink when I walk I don't know
why but just try and keep your eyes open
or if it's eye contact by happening feel
free to just stand there forwards for
something that's a little bit more
candid the pose number four is called
beef coy arms
and I decided to name it this because
when I do this pose it kind of looks
like a little coy like you've got a
little secret but this is when you have
one hand and you place it on your elbow
your forearm or even like your wrist
even the shoulder I mean depending on
the like the mood that you're going for
or the variety of shopping on a cake
just basically move your hand all across
the opposite arms one little pro tip is
I like to pop up my shoulders just to
give it a little bit more of like an
elongated arm because it looks like it
starts from here as opposed to here the
next color is called the candid hands
and this is essentially just keeping
your hands busy one of my favorites is
just a little ear tug like you're just
kind of adjusting yourself kind of you
know caught off guard a little bit
just kind of fix your hair behind your
ear or even kind of flip your hair over
keeping your arms kind of moving and
your hands busy I feel like that always
translates really well in from the
camera if you're wearing an outfit that
has pocket definitely use them because
you can just throw your hands in your
pockets and you don't have to worry
about posing them it just looks like
you're keeping your hands warm the same
thing goes with pants pockets if you
have a pocket in your bottom definitely
just throw that hand in make it look
like you're reaching something out of
there and if you don't have any pockets
so you got some belt loops those work
too you just throw your thumbs in kind
of looks a little cowgirl II but I think
it looks cool too if you still can't
figure out what to do with your hands
just throw in a prop my favorite one is
definitely a drink in your hand like
maybe it's a Starbucks cup or a mug a
cup of coffee it just keeps your hands
and you can throw both hands on them
take a little sippy-sip
it's just about interacting with
something in your photo as opposed to
just like standing there blankly next up
we've got beef sit and stare one of my
favorite places take photos are
staircases because I just love how
relaxed they look it's very street style
one tip I have is to always keep your
feet on different stairs or different
steps because it gives the photo more
layers and it gives a chance for you to
elongate your body even though you're
sitting down it just looks like you're
chilling or you've had just a really
long day and you just had to sit down on
some stairs and take a breather
pose number nine is called the look back
at it and this is when your body is
facing a
away from the camera but your face is
facing towards the camera so it looks
like you've just been something like oh
you calls me Tessa Pig this one
definitely requires some synchronizing
with your photographer so maybe have
them countdown when they're going to
take the photo so you can move your head
the goal is to have a little bit of
movement in your hair but sometimes it's
just really hard to get the shot so I'll
just literally just look back this way
and just get the shot that way when all
else fails and you don't know what to do
just pop the peace sign this is an easy
pose that anyone can do you can have it
directly next to you close to your face
above on somebody you know I mean
anything goes with the peace sign it's
just I don't know I just always think
it's cute this is one of my go shoes and
I really don't know what to do I feel
like it's really light-hearted cue and
it promotes a good message peace alright
guys so those were 10 poses they can try
to your next Instagram post or just any
photo you want to in general I am
definitely not a professional model and
I know that there are so many other
poses they can do but honestly these 10
are the ones that I just kind of
gravitate towards most because they're
comfortable and easy to do if you end up
trying any of these make sure you tag me
on Instagram and my town the pose that
you use in the caption I would love to
see what you guys come up with it's all
about having fun and capturing the
moment if you guys enjoyed this video

it'll encourage me to film more of these
videos for you I think for my next like
photo taking series video it might be
different locations you can take this
photo app I think always divide it I
mean even Los Angeles itself has so many
different backdrops but yeah I hope you

much for watching bye
