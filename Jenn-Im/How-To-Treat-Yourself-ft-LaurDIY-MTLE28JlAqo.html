- Hey everyone, it's your girl Jenn
and today is the final
episode of my series
with Simple Skincare who
is collaborating with me
and sponsoring this video.
We live in a day and
age where we barely have
any time for ourselves,
and I'm definitely guilty
of not getting enough me time.
So today I'm gonna bring
my friend Lauren in
and we're gonna show you
three self care DIYs.
So here we have Lauren.
Yay.
- Yay.
Thanks for having me.
- Yeah thanks for coming over.
- Yeah.
- This is like the first time
you've been to my place.
- Mmhmm.
- Oh my God,
we're finally doing it.
- I know.
Finally.
- Yeah.
So we have the DIY queen herself.
We're doing self care DIYs today.
So I just wanted to ask how
do you deal with stress?
Do you get stressed easily?
- Oh my gosh, I am the most
easily stressed out person
in the entire world,
I'm like super type A,
I'm a list maker.
And I feel like massages
are like my number one go-to
for de-stressing when I have time,
and then also meditation.
- Yeah, right.
I think lists and
definitely the meditations
are my way to go.
I wish I could enjoy massages more,
but I'm just so ticklish
that the first 20
minutes I'm like in pain.
(Lauren laughs)
Yeah, but I'm getting there slowly.
I need to chill a little more.
- Working on it.
- Yeah, so the first DIY we'll
be doing today is the mask,
these are ingredients that you
can easily find in your home.
I notice that when I get stressed out
my skin is the first sign to
show me that I'm stressed,
so it'll, like, get really dry,
it'll start breaking out.
- Yeah.
- So, yeah, these are the ingredients
for our masks we're making today.
Avocado, Simple's Hydrating Booster,
coconut oil, and honey.
Okay, so should we just
start mixing everything in?
- Yes, add it in.
- Yes, okay.
- I feel like these are
all really easy ingredients
I like, already have as well.
- For the hydrating
booster you're gonna add
like a teaspoon of that, so.
- Hit me with a little
bit of booster. (laughs)
- What kind of skin do you have?
- I have, like, combination skin.
I'm dry in some spots,
and then an oily T-zone,
which I feel like is really common.
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.
But I've got like, like
prepubescent skin I feel like.
(both laugh)
I'm like oh, I'm 24, I'm ready
to get out of puberty now.
That smells good.
- Oh my gosh,
it does smell really good.
- It smells really good.
- [Jen] Alright, so
this looks pretty, all--
- It looks face-maskable. (both laugh)
Right?
- Yeah it does.
- It looks face-maskable
right now.
- Yes it is pretty much ready.
- Yeah, it's good to go.
- Yeah, so the booster is in here,
can mix it into your
foundation, your moisturizer,
or you can just use it all over your face.
- A three in one.
- It is.
- I feel like I look like a '90s child
when I split my hair
like this behind my ears.
- Really? (laughs)
- I look like a Spice Girl now.
- It's cute, I like it.
- Okay, here we go.
What's your method of attack here?
- I'm gonna just plop it on,
- Just go for it.
- I'm just going for it.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
Here we go.
Oh, oh my gosh, it's very cooling.
- I think I have too much,
think I have too much.
- Really? (Lauren squeals)
- Oh yeah, you're right, it is cooling.
- Yeah.
- I'm like ready
for someone to take a chip to my face.
(Jen laughs)
- Yeah this is a very light, thin mask.
I think you just need a really thin layer
'cause you don't want
too much chunks on it.
How often do you do face masks?
- I probably do a mask, like,
I really like sheet masks as well.
I do these ones maybe like,
I don't know, once a week?
How often do you mask?
- I do around once a week too.
- I'm having more issues than you are,
you were like, you just finessed this,
I'm not so--
- I just kinda winged it,
like, I think you're good.
It looks the same, yeah.
- Girl, it does not look
the same. (both laugh)
- So you just leave this on
for 10 minutes, and that's it.
- So we just washed our faces,
and my face is feeling good.
- Yeah, right?
- Right?
- I feel like we got most of it off,
but just to make 100% sure
that everything's gonna
we're gonna go in with the
Simple Micellar Cleansing Water.
I'll squirt some on.
Yeah, this is my favorite Micellar water
because it's so gentle,
great for sensitive skin,
and it makes sure that
everything comes off.
- Which I love.
This is like when I find
out that I do a terrible job
of washing my face, it's
like, this is the proof,
that's like wow, I did not
put enough effort into that.
Already!
- It's like judgment day.
Yeah.
- I know,
and there's already makeup on it.
- Yeah mine's like, I've
got like debris on mine.
- Debris. (both laugh)
- Human debris.
- I just like wanna wash
off this whole pimple,
that'd be great.
- I just wanna wash my
whole entire body with this,
you know, just do like an entire cleanse.
- You know, the collar bones.
- Okay, now some stuff really came off.
Since winter is coming as well,
if you've got really dry skin
I highly recommend the
Micellar facial gel wash.
This is very hydrating
and good at removing
all your makeup off.
- Oh my gosh, that's like
such a must have for winter.
I feel like when the air dries up,
I'm like, my skins like
(makes slurping sound)
I need moisture.
- Yeah. (laughs)
So our second DIY is creating
your own meditation corner.
So here we are in a nice
little corner on the sofa.
- Literal corner.
- Literal corner.
So I think the best corners for meditation
are somewhere that's comfortable,
somewhere that there's lots
of light and it's serene,
basically anywhere you feel calm.
- No distractions, that's
my number one thing
is like if there's a
distraction anywhere nearby,
like, it's over for me.
- Right?
- It's over.
- This is what you're gonna need
for the meditation corner.
A candle, sage, and some crystals.
But yeah, so for our meditation corner
we've got some crystals,
these are, I mean, they're
apparently supposed to have,
like, power, you know.
- I feel like I'm so new to this world.
Everyone's like, ooh, crystals,
and I'm like tell me about the crystals.
- I feel like they're supposed
to produce negative ions,
so they're supposed to have
(mumbles), I don't really know,
but basically for me it's kinda
just like holding something
and putting intention in it.
- Oh my God
- Yeah.
- Wait, I kinda love that.
- Right, yeah.
- Yeah.
- So it's just something physical.
And then obviously we
gotta get the smells right.
We've got a big ol' candle
and we've also got some sage.
I've never actually lit sage--
- Neither have I.
- In this house before.
- Woah, are we saging
your house right now?
- Yeah, we could,
you're supposed to when you first move.
- All the bad spirits.
- Exactly.
This is like get rid of all the bad juju,
so yeah, we're going to
probably light this up
in a little bit, and then
we also have this app
called Headspace, this is
my favorite meditation app.
I have logged in over 100 sessions,
so I'm so excited to do this one with you.
- I know, I'm a newbie to meditation,
so today will be my guided, by Jen,
meditation session. (both laugh)
- Alright, I'm gonna light this baby up.
Lauren's got the crystals.
- I'm on crystal duty.
This is my first saging,
I'm so interested to see how this goes.
- Oh my gosh.
- Oh, oh yeah she's smokin'.
- She's smokin'.
- Be gone bad juju.
Oh yeah, that smells like, it smells like
when you go into any kind
of like mystic store.
- Yeah, right, it's like
coated in this scent.
Alright, so now we're gonna get
straight into the meditation.
- Your crystal.
- Oh thank you.
Thank you. (both laugh)
Alright, so I'm gonna
pick a 10 minute one.
- [Man] So either sitting
down or lying down.
And the muscles are softening,
giving way, switching off.
I'll see you back here
tomorrow for day seven.
- That was good.
I feel calm and relaxed.
- Yeah, me too.
It just really helps
you catch your thoughts,
because I feel like my
mind's always racing
so whenever I meditate it just helps me
like slow and dial things back.
- Oh my God, for sure,
I feel like there's never not a time
where I'm like okay, what's next,
what's next on my to-do list,
like, what am I doing now?
- Well, what next-- (laughs)
- Well.
- Next up we are doing our acai bowls.
- Great transition. (both laugh)
- Alright, so for our last DIY
we have the yummy acai
bowl. (Lauren cheers)
These are my favorite.
- Me too.
- Yeah, they're very energizing
and they've got a lot of antioxidants,
so great for your skin.
So here's what you're gonna need.
Almond butter, that's optional,
bananas, fresh berries, frozen berries,
acai powder, chia seeds, cashew
milk, and coconut flakes.
Okay, so we've got our blender here.
Gonna put all the ingredients in.
- Okay.
- Would you like to start?
- Let's do it, let's do it.
Okay, cashew milk.
- I used to work at a
smoothie shop actually.
- Really?
Oh my gosh, I worked at a grocery store,
I scooped ice cream.
- Me too.
- Really?
- Yeah, wait, which ice
cream store did you work at?
- Oh it was a Canadian,
like a little mom and pop Canadian place.
- Did your forearm get bigger?
Yeah, right, my right
forearm got bigger too,
I was like--
- This muscle right here
gets so big.
- Yeah, I worked at Baskin Robbins
and one of the test
questions was to memorize
all 31 flavors, yeah.
- Oh my gosh.
- It was nuts, but it was a good job.
I gained like 10 pounds. (laughs)
- Oh my gosh, okay, ready?
- Okay.
- Lid, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Okay, is it secure?
- No, I feel like it's not
on right, is that right?
- Okay yeah, it's on, it's on, okay.
(both cheer and laugh)
So then now we just add our toppings.
That's strawberries, blueberries, coconut,
- I feel like there's always the pressure
to make it look so pretty.
- Yeah, right?
- To just like demolish
it two minutes later.
- Well presentation just
makes food taste better
for some reason.
- I agree.
- [Jen] It's like a form of art.
Ooh, I like yours too.
- Eh.
It's like the face mask, I'm like,
you finessed it, I didn't.
- I've been practicing.
Wow.
- Yay.
- Alright, let's have a bite.
- Oh my gosh.
- Oooh.
- Mmmh.
- Mmh!
- It's like healthy ice cream.
Okay, I think we nailed it.
This is such a refreshing,
guilt-free snack,
I love having it on, like, healthy days.
- It's so re-energizing,
like a little pick me up.
- Exactly.
Alright guys, that is a wrap on the DIYs.
I had so much fun with you.
- Oh my gosh, thanks for having me.
I feel good, I feel calm,
I feel re-energized, full.
- Yeah, definitely full.
