in a very long time so I thought I'd
film one so here is my fall haul I'll
start things off really simple and slow
with something like sunglasses and I
bought three pairs of sunglasses from a
broad called key these are the first
pair these are called the Elton and I
have been loving the whole mirrored
effect on some lasses these sunglasses
reminded me of Terminator 2 I think it's
because they're all silver and I think
of that model t1000 when he would melt
into like the floor and he'd sneak into
a bunch of different cracks or something
this looks like the material he was made
out of so I think that's why I like that
because that movie is awesome and these
sunglasses are awesome next pair are the
kitties and these are very appropriately
named because they have a cute cat eye
silhouette and I think they are really
good with girls with a little bit of
attitude in their system I think they're
just some funky and feminine shades
which are going to be good for dull
outfits that need a pop my last pair of
sunglasses are these ones called iyd and
I'm not sure what it stands for but my
guesses are in your dreams
it could air and I act damn it but damn
it is one word these sunglasses also
have that Merit effect but the colors
are more cool toned and so I think
they're going to be really awesome to
pair with winter outfits I bought these
shorts from a little boutique called
Bedford Street laundry and I have been
wearing them non-stop because they are
so freakin comfortable I love the retro
print but the best part of these shorts
is the snapback detail on the back so
technically you can make them smaller or
bigger depending on the size of your
food baby so I bought an absurd amount
of things in Korea and so I thought I'd
put a portion of the things that were on
side of my bed and the rest will be
featured in another Korea haul vlog
we're all put like the cosmetics I
bought and the rest of the accessories
and some other fashion items that I got
a molding these pleather overalls I
bought them in a little Street Mart in
Hongdae at
more these when I went hiking walls in
Korea and it was probably one of the
worst decisions I made on that trip
because it was freaking hot I looked at
the temperature and it said it was going
to be 75 degrees so I was like all right
I can handle it but I fail to check the
humidity and so the end result was me
sweating in these overalls this is this
fabric really really retains a lot of
heat so they're going to be really
excellent for when the temperature
starts dropping
I love crop tops and I'm gonna wear them
in the fall by wearing them so here I
have a cropped US military jacket I got
this in a store called a land in Korea
this jacket is in a really lightweight
material which is going to be excellent
to wear with also there's a hint of camo
on the collar which i think is a nice
touch
my next cropped item is this cropped
flannel this one is quite oversized and
boxy but I like that look and I try to
give myself more shape by rolling up the
sleeves I personally got this because I
love love the pattern and the coloring
of this flannel and like the other item
I just showed you this top is going to
be great to wear with so this the Klan
thrifted piece but it's not I actually
got it in one of these little stores in
Kingdom moon which hosts with craziest
shopping centers plural centers I've
ever walked into anyway I got this fuzzy
blue angora sweater with all these
Trump's of color on it kind of looks
like vomit but I'm really into that and
it's also cropped and it's got a batwing
sleeve it's just something quirky that I
thought would go excellent with my
sweater collection this next jacket I
bought and honed it and it is very very
oversized because it is a men's jacket
and I had to get it because when you
turn it around it has a huge cat on the
back trust as Chairman Mao but instead
it says Chairman Mao I thought it was
clever so I bought it I bought this
burgundy coat at a store called eight
seconds in Korea and it is very
structured boxy and it kinda reminds me
of uniform which is why I personally
love it and I actually went to three
different eight-second stores before I
committed on getting it now that I'm
looking back I really thought that I got
it here's some items from
I was gifted these but I personally
picked them up with my index finger and
my thumb to click I'm holding univ a per
jacket and I think this truck is so cool
and interesting and just freakin weird
but I think that's why I'm obsessed with
it it's a translucent moto jacket and I
thought it'd be cool to wear during
rainy days kind of like a raincoat with
the twist I love the way it looks when
it's paired with all white because it
just looks so fresh and clean the next
item is this button-down and it's got
these really fluffy feathers falling
down as the print and I thought this
would be really good for any family
parties or events where I should
probably dress a little bit more modest
it's got a asymmetrical hemline so it's
gonna cover that booty but you can still
show off your jeans in the front I got
some huff socks you've seen these on
tumblr and now it is my turn to own
these bad boys
I thought these socks were really
awesome perfect to wear on little cozy
nights in I got them in black and white
because that is my color scheme at the
moment not today cuz I'm wearing my PJs
still it's been a habit of mine while
filming speaking portions lately I also
got some silver accessories I'm
untangling one right now this is a
blocked necklace it's it kind of looks
industrial which is the reason why I was
drawn to it and next I've got these
really intense silver earrings I love
dangly earrings because they add some
interesting movement on your face or
near your face I guess the last batch of
items are from lovely wholesale and
these were also gifted to me but I have
picked them out myself and I happen to
pick out all things that were outerwear
because it is fall and that need that
need comes out first I got this cobalt
blue cardigan and this is as blue as
true blue is going to get I think it's
gonna be great to layer with the top and
some shorts and also it's got pockets
that is all the next cardigan I have is
this brown or this tan one and I got
this because it had these really
interesting lapels on it they kind of
flow and cascade down and it adds a lot
more movement and makes any outfit more
casual and this one also has pockets my
next item is this black and white jacket
this
also has the fluttery lapels on it but
it's got this really sick white piping
all along it and the white just really
pops out from the black I thought it was
just a kind of formal piece to add to my
wardrobe I picked out this chunky black
and white sweater the arms are really
fitted so you can still maintain your
figure and it also has this really sick
cutout detailing on the column and to
finish off my haul I have this white
lace moto jacket and it is combining two
of my favorite things into one perfect
item I know this piece kind of looks
more for the springtime but pairing this
outfit with cute little holiday justice
makes me excited to wear this in
December and January so that's it that's
my gigantic fall haul if you are
