for the very much anticipated spring
haul video I've accumulated so much
stuff throughout the past few months so
please don't think I got all this stuff
overnight definitely did not happen like
that these have been sitting in my
closet for months I've been like
wracking my brain on how I can showcase
these items with you so I thought a haul
would be the best shout so let's dig in
I'm going to start off with outerwear so
the first piece is this long speckled
coat from Willow and clay this is a very
lightweight jacket because it's not
lined usually I'd be kind of like
annoyed that it's not lined but in this
case I don't mind because it makes it
really comfortable to wear in LA it's
already kind of hot here so this is a
great coat to just throw on in the day
and I won't be sweating I love the
length of it and the fact that it has
raw edges it kind of gives it like a
street style vibe next up I have this
burnt sienna cardigan from pomelo
I love how oversized it is I love how
long it is this is perfect for those
days we're just not feeling the way you
look and everything that you wear it
just looks terrible on you you just
drape this giant Karndean over it and
call it a day it's kind of like what you
would do with the giant blanket but this
is actually in the form of clothing so
it is socially acceptable I got this
gorgeous cream bomber at the end other
stories in New York while I was visiting
in February and when I saw this on the
rack just like my jaw dropped I had to
have it it's this gorgeous smooth silky
material and I'm honestly terrified to
wear it sometimes because the cream is a
very high-maintenance color I definitely
can't wear this on nights out where
drinks will be involved with my luck
chances are someone with a cranberry
vodka is going to spill it all over the
jacket so I can't risk that
so this bomber is reserved for days on
where I'm going to like a relatively
sanitary place like a museum or a
library you know somewhere where just
bad stuff can't happen also I want to
mention that this is lined and there's a
pocket right here so you can put your
cell phone inside here we have an item
that pack
punch this is my pink bomber from petals
and peacocks and normally I stray away
from color but now that spring is
rolling in I'm like ready to play with
bright and bold pieces again and I wore
this in San Francisco where the wind is
very very real and because it's lined
and high-quality
it kept me nice and toasty another
quirky outerwear piece that I've added
to my wardrobe is this patches and pins
bomber from Zara I've always wanted to
you know personalize my own piece of
outerwear with a bunch of patches and
pins that I've collected throughout
places around the world but I mean that
never happened I got lazy and so I just
bought this instead I was kind of on the
fence about it until I saw this J patch
on the sleeve I took it as a sign that
this is meant to be mine
this is one of those jackets where
there's so much stuff going on that it
ends up kind of working out in the end I
just think it looks really fun and
quirky and I got a size medium because I
wanted it to be a little bit more
oversized and just in case I wanted to
wear like you know a thicker sweater
underneath this would work okay I swear
this is the last bomber I'll show you in
this goddamn video I did not realize how
many bombers I've collected throughout
the months but I mean I guess it
happened anyway this is my tan bomber
from the brand naked and I think this
color is perfect for those days where
you just want a lighter palette for your
outfit honestly I think that all these
bombers are a sign that I should
probably do a video about how i style
bombers because clearly I'm having a big
moment with them I'm gonna wrap up this
section with one last coat which is not
a bomber instead it is this gorgeous
trench / moto coat jacket I throw in the
word moto because these lapels remind me
of something that a moto jacket would
have but it's also like a trench coat
because of the material and the length
of it I think it's awesome the lapels
are really cool because you can zip them
up for more of a tailored vibe or you
can just leave it loose which is the way
I prefer it I think this is a great
staple piece for any transitioning
season alright now we're going to jump
on over to the tops here is my on-the-go
jumper and what I really liked about it
is just kind of like this funny play off
of the whole chinese-takeout vibe the
logo is actually embroidered
it's like nicely stitched it's not
something that they just slapped on an
iron it's something that they took their
time with which I appreciate and yeah
it's just a really great casual jumper
for outfits where you want to pop a read
next I have a basic gray a sweater from
American Apparel this is ridiculously
soft I've already worn it twice in an
airplane because it's that comfortable
what kind of sets it apart from the rest
of the great sweaters in my closet is
the fact that it has this really nice
rounded hem at the bottom I love it I
think it's really cute and chic I have
always loved tops that are off the
shoulder I think there's something
really sexy and feminine about showing
the shoulder so I'm very excited to
share with you this printed forest-green
patterned off the shoulder top that is a
ton of adjectives that I just used but
that's the shirt basically the shoulder
part is quite stretchy so you can wear
it as a high neck collar if you want
more of an Edwardian style shirt either
way I like the way it looks off the
shoulder because personally I feel like
it looks more flattering that way
ruffles are so fun for the spring this
is my striped and ruffle top from pixie
market and it's got a lot going on but I
still got a lot of love for it it's got
a ruffle on the sleeve it's got a ruffle
on the collar and all along the end of
it and top it all off there's this tie
right here this is something that I
would wear sealing or if I ever had an
opportunity to ride a boat I would wear
this shirt I think would be perfect for
it it's kind of like bordering a pirate
all you a deed is like an eye patch and
a captain's hat but yeah anyway I still
love this shirt I think it's cute I love
to lounge and even when I'm lounging I
still like to make an effort in what I
wear and that's why I love cropped tops
this is from cheap Monday and I love the
fact that it's very oversized very
comfortable very soft and it has this
really cool like cheap Monday school
logo on it but I like the fact that it's
kind of cut off so it's not too much in
your face it's just kind of like a
subtle logo you know I've added another
white blouse into the mix here is my
lightweight top that just kind of laces
up in the front I've noticed that these
lace-up tops are quite popular but
most of the time they're on shirts that
are very you know body con form fitting
but I mean I just wanted something a
little bit different from that so that's
why I like the fact that this is a
little bit more oversized and it's just
more comfortable to wear my next top is
not oversized it's actually very
form-fitting this is my camel crop top
that has this nice ribbed texture to it
I really like the sleeves in it because
it's got a slit making it kind of like a
bell sleeve effect and yeah I like to
wear this with bottoms that are slightly
more loose because this is so fitted at
the top I just like to always have like
opposites in outfits if I've got a loose
top I'll wear a tight bottom vice-versa
speaking of bell sleeves check out this
gorgeous lace crop top and all of its
glory oh man I love this top this is
like the definition of a boho top like
it's got the generous fella sleeve it's
got the cropped lace this is going to
look amazing with high-waisted items I
personally like to wear high-waisted
stuff cropped items because I just think
it's a good balance this next section is
for the one pieces I have I don't really
have that many but I thought I would put
it in its own section just to stay
organized anyway here is my black romper
I love the quarter length sleeves
because it kind of makes it a little bit
more formal and even though it's kind of
loose you can still find your shape by
tying this around your waist
it also has pockets which I'm always a
fan of the bust part I found a little
bit too exposing for me so I've added a
black lace camisole for more coverage I
have a love and hate relationship with
overalls I love the way they look but I
hate the process of finding a decent
pair I'm only 5 foot 1 I'm pretty short
so it's difficult to find long overalls
that look decent on me but luckily I
found these overalls from the Kendall
and Kylie line I basically got the strap
and I cut open another hole just so it
fit my frame better but I mean I think
it looks great now I love the fact that
it's a dark indigo wash I find it very
flattering and I love the back it's very
funky it's got this lace-up shoelace
thing on the back and I think it's like
a really nice thing to bring
apart I'm just stoked that I found a
pair of overalls that looked decent on
me the only bottom in this hall is this
leather skirt from the cupola what drew
me to it was obviously the color it's
this really deep rich forest green color
it kind of looks black in this light but
trust me it is forest green I really
love this gunmetal Hardware all along
the sides and this is more of like a
winter piece but I don't care this is
gonna look killer no matter what season
it is probably gonna reserve this for
like a night outfit like going out with
the girls outfit I don't know I'm
shaking it like this but yes very happy
about this skirt all right guys we're at
the last stretch of the hall I'm just
going to quickly speak about some
accessories and then we're done Zoe with
the video here are these sunglasses that
I got from escape I do have the blue
version of this pair but when I saw that
they launched the pink I had to grab
them I'm envisioning these on me at
Coachella which is what prompted me to
get it I'm just so excited I just love
pops of pink right now I'm just having a
moment with them I've been noticing that
I have way too much silver in my jewelry
collection so I wanted to add a little
bit more bold pieces which is why I got
this cute little necklace it gathers in
the middle to the circle and then it
just drops down into the single gold bar
it's very dainty and cute and I think
that it's just gonna bring out the
warmth in my skin next up I have these
necklaces that are so perfect for
layering it's got a little crescent
shape and a bigger crescent shape I mean
you can wear them separately but I think
they just look really good together I
suppose you can probably like give one
to your friend and have like have it as
like a best friend necklace type of
thing I might do that actually Stephanie
do you want one of these
the last and final item in this haul are
these earrings I just like it because I
found the hardware quite interesting
it's got two spikes here and it just
drops down into a nice circle it's kind
of like a new take on the hoop earring
but I thought that these were more
interesting Wow okay
so you've made it to the end of the
spring haul I know that this was a huge
one but I've been hanging on to these
items for so long now I'm so happy that
I just finally got to show them all to
you I am so excited for the spring and
summer because I'm just a person that
love's warmth I just crave it like I
would much rather be too hot than too
cold like what about you guys would you
rather be too hot or too cold leave it

to know what you think thank you so much
