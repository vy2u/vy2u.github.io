title is correct you are about to get a
thrift haul video I went to the goodwill
in Glassell Park with very very low
expectations because let's be real it's
been a while since I've thrifted so I
wasn't sure if I still had the eye but
luckily I got a ton of stuff which is
why I'm doing this haul for you and if
you enjoy these drifting videos make
sure to subscribe to my channel it's
free and it only takes a second anyway
without further ado let's get into the
first piece I'm starting the video off
with dresses because that was the first
section that I pounced on so here is my
printed babydoll dress with a bunch of
animals that you'd find in the Safari
this was originally a long maxi dress
but I just got a pair of scissors and
haft it in half because I just like the
silhouette on me and even though the
hems not perfect doesn't matter I was
going for that nice DIY look anyway so
here is my second dress I was really
attracted to this because of the
hardware on the straps it's got this
beautiful buckle detail and I think that
makes it look really cool also I am
loving these little buttons on the side
it gives it a nice vintage feel I mean
this dress probably is vintage like this
tab looks freaking old this next dress
is more of a summer dress but I had to
pick it up because it was so fun and
vibrant and I think this print is so
gorgeous I really love the way pink and
green look together I just think they're
so so complementary and I feel like this
is something that Nasty Gal itself like
40 bucks but I also got this for six
dollars so definitely a steal I would
love to wear this dress in Hawaii and
just forget that summer is over
so my last dress is a little
questionable when I first saw this on
the rack I was like why am I so
attracted to you I don't know why but I
have to take you home I honestly think
it's because of the graphics it's so
garish that it's actually pretty cool
the more you look at it the more weird
things you see you see like a screaming
tiger like serpents surrounding again
yang is just almost psychedelic and I
think it's really bold unapologetic and
I think it's a great fit and one of the
pros of thrifting is you can really play
around with trends that you're kind of
unsure of and it's not much of a
financial
like this dress was five bucks and I'm
not losing sleep about like whether this
dress looks amazing on me or not it's
just fun to play around with and that's
what fashion is about all right let's
move on over to the tops now here is my
first one this is this very oversized
sheer striped bib house what really
caught my eye was obviously the sheer
texture I love anything that's sheer I
think it's really sexy very peekaboo
I feel like this top is really amazing
for humid areas like Singapore for
example this kind of gives you like a
winter feel even though it's still
freakin hot outside and you won't be
sweating so here is my second top which
is a very elaborate graphic long-sleeve
when I first saw this top I was praying
that it was Kenzo but obviously it
wasn't it is by a brand that it doesn't
even have a brand it is nameless it
reminds me of the dress that it just got
more you look more you see there's
zebras there's Phoenix's there's Lions
there's a lot of stuff I know that
there's a lot going on but I feel like
these types of tops Porter from hideous
to high fashion and I think that's a
line that you should always kind of
tinker around in it's fun next up I've
got this white tank nothing spectacular
here but everyone needs more basics this
is the type of top that looks good with
any bottom it's got this nice
asymmetrical hem and has no stains
actually now that I've said it I see a
bunch of stains on it there's like this
blue pen stain here and then oh God and
there's like a bit of brown I'm hoping
that's not blood Oh God I should
definitely wash this the next item is
this printed shawl I absolutely love the
pattern on this it's very intricate and
just gives off a really really cool vibe
this is something that can throw on with
a graphic tee a white tank or just on
days where you just don't want to show
your arms this would also be an amazing
beach cover-up
there's a lot of functionality in a
shawl like this so keep that in mind for
the last category we're gonna finish off
with bottoms because we're at the bottom
of the video I guess the end of the
video but anyway here are these satin
shorts they are this rich cobalt blue
color they've got this beautiful floral
pattern to it and they've got a really
stretchy waist I feel like these shorts
would be
really interchangeable from pajamas to
the public and I love dual functionality
like that my last final item is this
brown button-down skirt I feel like this
is definitely going to be one of my fall
essentials because I absolutely love
this color and I think it's gonna look
killer paired with a turtleneck even
though I have a lot of skirts in this
silhouette I thought I would just show
that you guys can get some really modern
and fresh pieces at the store but for a
fraction of the price alright guys that
was my haul from Goodwill and I am sorry
that this video was so long overdue I
think the last time I did a thrifty
video is when I was in Auckland
so really have no excuse for that it's
just one of those things that have been
on my to-do list for a really long time
and I kept on postponing it I kept on
pushing it back then a year past and
then the whole task just seemed daunting
and intimidating
I don't know last week I just woke up
and I was like I should really do this
I'm just gonna frickin do it and I'm
actually really happy that I did because
I got some amazing pieces that I
normally wouldn't have gotten at the
store and for that I'm really happy
definitely go check out your local
thrift store consignment store whatever
and if you find anything cool make sure
you hit me up on social my username is

that but you could it be up there I
would love to see if you enjoyed this
