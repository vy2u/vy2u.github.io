- Hi everybody.
- Hi guys.
- Welcome back to the channel.
Here I am with a lovely guest here.
- It's me.
- We're back because we gotta
finish off the styling challenge.
And previously on styling
couples challenge,
Ben put me in clothes that
he thought would look good
and he did a really great job (laughs).
- He thought a good...
No one else did.
- Really, no.
Ben did an amazing job.
If you haven't seen that video,
I'll put it in the cards,
please go check it out.
But today, we are switching
the tables around.
- I'm much more happy
about this way around.
I get clothes and I don't have to
have that stress of trying to find it.
And I'm excited to see what you,
I think you've got good taste.
- Well thank you.
- I think you know what,
- You've had to deal with
me struggling to find
anything I like so you get
to have a struggle today.
- He's very picky, so...
- I am.
- We'll see what we find.
I'm gonna get him four outfits.
First is everyday Ben, which
is a casual little look.
Number two is lads night out.
This is, you know, all the
boys goin' out together.
The third look is the date night look,
so something a little bit more polished
and kind of swanky.
- Yeah.
- And the last one is a wildcard.
So I get to put him in
whatever thing I want.
So now I'm going to go to just like
a little shopping area
and try and find some
clothes for this man over here.
- Thank you.
(upbeat electronic music)
- [Ben] Um, excuse me
Jenn what are here for?
- You know, maybe for the wildcard?
I look like chic.
(laughing)
(upbeat electronic music)
Last stop is Urban Outfitters.
We're gonna get most the basics here
and also the wildcard.
- [Ben] Oh.
(upbeat electronic music)
- One for Be, one for me.
(laughing)
Alright, we are back from shopping
and I must say it's a very
good season for Ben right now.
There's a lot of good stuff in the shops.
So, I think you should
get into everyday Ben.
- Do this.
- First look.
- This is really nice.
I don't have to change for once.
- I like it.
- Oh my gosh.
- Have you ever seen...
- Hey gus.
- this much color on Ben?
- I haven't.
- This looks incredible.
- I actually really like it.
- Ben is actually pretty
bold with patterns
but it has to be the right pattern
and I thought that this
floral print was perfect.
- [Ben] Zara, right?
- Yeah, this is Zara.
- Nice.
- [Jenn] The pants are from
Urban, the shoes are from Silas.
- [Ben] Adidas.
- Adidas, yeah.
- And Silas.
- And the crew.
- Exactly.
- Yeah, I'm very happy.
I think out of 10, I shall give this a,
I'll give this a nine actually.
- A nine?
- Yeah.
- Holy crap!
- You know obviously I'm gonna be nice,
it's Jenn and stuff anyway.
But no, I do really like it.
You didn't go with a safe option.
I think everyone would be annoyed to see
I've got black jeans and a black t-shirt.
(laughing)
- Yeah, I like it, nine out of 10.
Good job.
- So the next outfit is
going to be lads night.
- Right
- Oooh.
- Well for starts I feel very comfortable.
- What a stud.
- I like, oh?
(laughing)
- [Jenn] I wanted to put
Ben in an outfit that
he would feel comfortable just hanging
out with the lads so
that's why I put him in
kind of like a all black
slash gray ensemble.
I absolutely love this coat.
- Me too.
- [Jenn] This is from The Kooples.
It's got this really cool
quilted detail on the lapels.
I feel like with Ben,
there's not too many options
for accessories so you gotta
throw 'em on the pants,
next is, they're like
an advanced jogger pant.
- [Ben] Smart casual.
- [Jenn] I think the shoes work though.
- I love the shoes, yeah.
- It's like a nice...
- [Jenn] Like, leather material.
- It's nice, smart,
especially for lads night.
You gotta think about logistics.
You know, you got pants,
you're going for some drinks,
&amp;quot;oh no, your wallet's safe.&amp;quot;
Black t-shirt I think just
ties it in with the outfit
and again, if you're
out, you know the guys
spill a drink on you...
- True.
- No problem.
- So what would you give this out of 10?
- Ooh, you guys are gonna annoy me so,
I'm gonna have to do nine again.
- Nine?
- Yeah.
- What's the one point?
- I think I can't give a 10 just because
there's quite a lot of black and...
- Oh okay, that's a good point.
Yes.
- Just for you being kind
of fishing out there,
this is great.
I would definitely buy one of this easily
in the shop, so thank you babe (laughs).
- Nice, yeah.
Well it looks incredible.
I feel like we can go on a date right now.
- Alright.
- Look, we're ready.
- Let's do it.
(laughing)
- Alright, so now let's
get you changed into
the actual date night outfit.
(hand clasps)
- Oh.
- Oooh.
- Oh la la.
- Hey guys.
- Ready for date night, eh?
- I feel very ready for date night.
- Yeah, you look very smart.
I know girls have all the options of like
skirts, dresses, et cetera.
A man's item that really
shines through is outerwear.
By far.
I absolutely love this coat.
I's long, it is in this
cool hounds tooth pattern.
It's got this cool pin on the lapel
and I just paired it
with a white crisp top
that he already had in his closet.
And then for bottoms,
he's wearing these really
comfy lounge pants but they
still look quite smart.
- [Ben] I like that it's quite
an English looking outfit.
- [Jen] Yeah.
- The Doc Martins with this kind of,
especially the long coat you know,
I really want to wear this
when I go hack in London.
&amp;quot;Oh hi mate.&amp;quot;
- It's in like this kinda stiff material.
So that if something spills, I feel like
it would repel off or something.
- Should be fine.
Yeah, I'm very happy.
I think I would give this,
I have to give it a nine again.
- Nine?
- I know.
- Okay, alright.
- Well I think my point
is, I would give it a 10
purely just because of the coat.
- Oh.
- You know like, and that's so I
couldn't be happier about that.
And everything else you paired nice
but again, there's not too much color,
so I think you dropped a point there.
- Okay, well you're looking
incredible, very dapper,
but now it is time for the wildcard!
So go change into
- Oh.
- The little fun little
number that I got you.
- Ah, see you guys in a sec.
Sorry in advance.
(Jenn laughing)
- Oh my gosh.
- Hey guys.
- This is the first time I've
ever seen you in overalls.
- This is the first time I've
ever seen me in overalls.
Palm trees, what are
these little goin' on?
- I know, these patches are
just, I know, Chippo approves.
- He likes it (laughing).
- So I wanted to find Ben the trendiest
male fashion trend
that's goin' on right now
and I would probably say overalls?
I don't see it very often
but Urban Outfitters
- So many options.
- There's so many options
- For overalls, if you're
looking for overalls,
head over there.
- Checkered, if you want like...
- Plaid, black navy...
- Anything, anything you want.
- So I went ahead and
found this patches one.
The thing is, I would wear these overalls.
- They're awfully comfortable.
- Yeah, oh my God (laughs).
There's like a nautical star, checkered...
- Checked lightning there.
- Flags, yeah it's...
- Everything you need.
- So what do you think?
- I don't hate it but I don't like it.
- Yeah, the thing is if you
picked this out yourself,
I wouldn't stop you, I'd be like
&amp;quot;okay, if you really
like the way that looks.&amp;quot;
- Really, really want this (laughs).
- No, I mean I wouldn't, I would just been
&amp;quot;oh, Ben's been more adventurous.&amp;quot;
- I'd be down to try a pair that,
you know, didn't have all
this nonsense all over it.
But again, you know if you
like it, you like it, you know?
- It's kind of farmer-like.
But it's like street style farmer.
Alright, so let's go, let's go out!
- Let's go show..
- Alright.
- Let's go paint the town red.
- Oh for God's sake.
- I'm ready.
(upbeat electronic music)
- Alright guys, that is
a wrap on the outfits.
I would say I did a pretty good job!
- A great...
- But you guys let me know how I did
in the comments down below.
I mean, I got straight
nines across the board.
- Just try to remind them.
- I know I am.
- Don't be that mean because, you know,
I did get straight nines.
(laughing)
- 27 out of 30.
(laughing)
If you'd like to see more styling videos,
please write it down in
the comments down below.
We'd love to hear what
you guys have to say.
Also before we left, we have a
really exciting announcement.
Actually Ben has a really
exciting announcement.
- I do, I just started a YouTube channel.
It's been something...
- Woo hoo.
- I've wanted to do for awhile
and I wasn't sure what
I wanted it to be about
and I was trying to
think what I could offer,
what I feel like I'm
okay at and my positivity
is something that I wanted
to spread and kind of
have a channel would like
give good advice about
tryin' to be the best
version of ourselves.
But it's got a bit of a twist to it.
Some comedy.
I've doin' some videos
where I clone myself
as the alter ego and
there's two of me talking.
It's really hard to explain
so you just gotta watch it, really.
- Yeah, you just have to
go see it for yourself.
- Just go and watch it.
- Ben has been working so hard on it
and I'm so proud of him
so please go subscribe,
show him some love and, yeah,
let him know what you guys think.
- Yet, be nice.
I always say please...
- Be nice.
(laughing)
- Alright, I want to thank
you so much for watching
and we'll see you in the next one.
- Bye guys.
- Bye.
