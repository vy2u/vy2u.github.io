so should be a lot of fun so I'm gonna
head on over there right now
so let's go hi guys welcome to jingle
bells day 19 unfortunately I'm not
feeling too great cold is of all vague
it's just ahead early hurts I had a date
quill oh and I'm just gonna work on
tried to rest so I watches of YouTube
videos to make myself feel better and
plagues Ipsy it is 1 o'clock and I took
a dayquil I took a Baraka and I
definitely got a second wind it's crazy
how much medication can help when you're
when you're feeling ill today is
actually going to be a pretty busy one I
have to go to my parents house to give
them their gifts because I'm spending
Christmas in England so that's a bummer
but I'll be spending New Year's Day with
them and that means much more to them
that Christmas like for Koreans New
Year's Day is like a big deal so as long
as I'm there for that that's all they
care about and then I'm gonna meet with
my girls Lisa and Emily we're going to a
holiday party and that I'm going to give
their Christmas presents then anyway I'm
gonna go ahead and get ready
alright guys lots of progress I have
finished cleaning up the house I think
it looks pretty damn good cleaning the
bathroom and I slipped the floors didn't
suffer because they'll just do that when
I get back I'm one of those people that
really enjoy cleaning if I'm like
stressed out or if I'm feeling kind of
anxious I'll just start cleaning uh-huh
I think that's why I relate to Monica a
lot from friends she's just kind of like
my spirit animal
no one ever regrets cleaning up you're
not like god I wish you to waste my time
cleaning up my room
it just looks fab and it really helps my
mood Allah Suns going down there's just
my little manicure I went for the same
color that I wore before this lovely
nude is called nude for you and it's
part of all my songs collection hi o me
for watching which is ugly enough to
send it over and I freaking love it the
noodles really beautiful but I kind of
wanted an extra kind of shine so I went
with SC's sequins ash and it just kind
of put like really nice like nude
iridescent I mean the color is still the
same but this one just adds a little bit
of sparkle
and then I just did the top coat and
that's it
hey guys I got my coffee and I'm in my
comfies I'm ready to go to my parents
house to eat a nice dinner and my mom
made kimchi jjigae so I'm freaking
excited
it sounds so bomb right now nothing like
eating comfort food when you're not
feeling the best okay alright let's go
kimchi-jjigae doesn't look that nice
right now but I already had already had
it karma listen II da recording of
whistle oh very smart so I am done
getting ready I feel pretty good about
my outfit actually I am wearing a black
turtleneck and then I just piled a ton
of jewelry on it to make it hyundai
sparkly and then I decided to wear this
cute little skirt and oh crap these
pockets are functional boy crap okay
awesome then I'm just gonna hop on over
this coat like that and then I have some
wonder to wear this hat by don't know if
it's like overkill I mean oh yeah okay
oh my god I love me a good hat it's
probably like not the best idea to grab
a drink when you're sick but I mean
there are worse things you can do I
guess I'll see you guys at the party
you
hi guys welcome to day 20 it is the day
after the night out and I had so much
fun last night we went to the well for
the özil party and it was just so
awesome seeing my girlfriend's like Lisa
and Emily and we wanted Sophia to come
out too but then I think she went out
two nights in a row and so today was her
night off if you're watching her vlog me
says that you would know that I think
we're all trying to meet up we all come
back Stephanie's in the bay we're all
kind of split up I come back to LA on
the 27th so we're going to try and have
a reunion then I've done my packing I've
done a pretty good job if I do say so
myself you can't really see but I did a
pretty good job with packing I think I'm
filming a would you look book in London
so I've packed my outfits for that and
then for the rest of the days I'm there
I'm just gonna like mix and match what I
have don't know how much footage I'm
going to have today because well that's
just like traveling like it's so hectic
and then when you put vlogging on top of
it you can get a little bit crazy but
who knows maybe I'll be at the airport
be like I'm gonna film everything so
I'll see you at the airport
hi guys so I am in London now and I'm
sick as ever my nose will not stop
running it's like I feel like the
corners of my nose are so raw from just
rubbing um tissue all over it
babe ah I made it in one piece so happy
and Ben and I are staying at the
rosewood hotel and it's just so nice to
be reunited we're only like separated
for two days but it just felt like
forever but yeah my video with dread
cents just came out it's the New Year's
Eve dress one and you guys are just
giving so much great feedback and I'm
just so happy because that first sounds
a little nervous about posting it
because it's just different you know
from the usual style but you guys seem
to be taking it really well and I'm just
so happy so far I'm just napped cuz I
didn't really sleep on the plane which
was weird I slept for nearly three hours
but I don't know the person next to me
was just like very fidgety and I think
he was just like an anxious flyer and
then it just kind of got to me it was
like like what if something does go
wrong but now after my nap after
uploading the video I feel ready to go
out for dinner so I'm just gonna go get
ready probably just gonna do like some
foundation eyebrows and like a wing or
something we'll see
