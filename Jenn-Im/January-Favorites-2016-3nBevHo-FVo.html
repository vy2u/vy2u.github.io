welcome to the very first episode of
favorites of 2016 I'm going to talk
about some of the things that I loved in
January now that it's done it over with
so let's just get started my first
favorite is gonna be a lip product is
soap and glories pillow plump XXL
technically this is a lip enhancing
product but that's not the reason why I
love it if I'm going to be totally
honest I don't really see a difference
in my lip size I'll show you a before
and after and maybe my lips are bigger
by like a millimeter but it is not very
noticeable so don't expect Kylie Jenner
lips it's not gonna happen I love this
because I love the shade I feel like it
just really goes with my skin tone and I
like the way the gloss looks next up I
have a skincare favorite it is the face
shop's chia seed water 100 moisturizer
and I started this tub in the beginning
of December and look at it it's pretty
much gone so I think it's safe to say
that I am a fan of it it's more of a gel
than a cream so it's very lightweight
and it absorbs very very quickly and I
feel like it's just been maintaining the
condition of my skin but once I finished
the tub I'm like not committed to this
moisturizer I'm probably gonna venture
out and try another face cream I feel
like I'm just on this never-ending
journey of finding the perfect face
cream I've been through so many tubs of
different face creams so this one goes
on the good list but like this need for
me to find the perfect face cream has
not been fulfilled so I do want to give
this like a nice pat in the back but I'm
just not committed to it
moving on to accessories I am featuring
a hat duh
it is this cap from Huff and I believe
jesse has the same cap as this so now we
are hat twins I hope you don't mind I
really like this because of the corduroy
material I feel like makes it a little
bit different and the logo so cute it's
in a really dainty beautiful cursive the
back is also cool because it is a
leather strap as opposed to the normal
like buckle strap that most snap backs
and caps have I feel like this gives it
more of a high-end feel and I feel like
caps like these
just having a huge moment right now in
fashion because of the really like
effortless sporty look it gives I really
like the tomboy vibes and it's just a
hat that I will continue to wear from
now on to the summer another accessory
that I've been loving are my new
prescription glasses from general
eyewear I purchased these in Camden in
December and it took a while for it to
ship because they were putting my
prescription and everything I really
like wearing these on nights out even I
feel like they're a really great
accessory and they're functional I am
starting to grow my prescription glasses
collection because I feel like a pretty
maxed out in the sunglass department so
I've got a new thing to start collecting
now moving on to a TV show that has
consumed my life and Ben's life uh
you're officially obsessed with The
Walking Dead and I know I know we're
really late to the party but does it
really matter it just matters that we're
here now it's fine I get it I really
love The Walking Dead no - and we first
started with The Walking Dead on I want
to say like January 23rd and now we're
on season 5 and that's like a lot of
episodes we were just like power through
each season and I think it took me a
while to to start it because I I'm just
like a naturally terrified person I get
scared really easily I can't take scenes
that like where like people jump out at
you I finished season one I got over it
walkers don't even faze me now I am fine
like Ben and I even watch the walkers
like extra closely to see like which
extras are really bad because there's
always like that one extra that's like
doesn't have like the Walker walk right
I keep on telling Ben that I want to try
out to be in the walking dead just as
like a walker I'll be freaking sick like
how cool would that be
for those who don't know the plot of The
Walking Dead it's just a drama that
takes place in a zombie apocalypse and
first my favorite character was Glenn
like just because of like the Korean
bond and I still love love Glenn and
Maggie but after I kept on watching I
would say like my top two favorite
characters of the show are probably
Daryl and Michonne like they're just so
bad
and if I had a PICC group to get stuck
with it be then like I think I would
live pretty sure I would live but yeah
I'm almost almost caught up I know the
new season comes out in February and so
I want to catch up to you guys for the
new season so I'm very excited very
eager I am so happy to be a part of this
my last favorite is a book favorite and
it's a little bit different from any of
the other books that I recommended it is
how to be happy or at least less sad by
Lee Crutchley and I thought that this
book would be a good thing to mention
especially with all the New Year's
resolutions floating around I know one
of the top resolutions is to be happy
and be happy with yourself in your life
and that's why I thought this book would
be a good shout out I feel like it's
been really helpful to me because it's
not like your normal self help book that
promises you all the answers it doesn't
give you like a 10-step program on how
to be happy it asks you questions and
it's more interactive and you get to
really tackle your own problems but in a
creative way and that's what I really
like about it and I don't really want to
show you what I've written in here
because it's very personal but I can
show you a page that I have not filled
out yet so this page says record any
negative tweet or status update you
think of here and so this is where you
vent and rant and say some really dark
stuff and then the next page says use
this space to think of positive
alternatives so it's spinning everything
a negative that you just said so it
helps you see the black and the white
this book is definitely gonna make you
feel uncomfortable but I feel like
nothing ever happens from your comfort
zone you have to step out of it in order
to get better and I feel like more you
put into this book the more effective it
is and I just thought that I would
mention this because I know a lot of
people are struggling I know everyone
has their own battles they're going
through and so I thought that this book
would be something good and helpful for
those who want to do something about
their emotions alright guys so those
were my January favorites and I got a
lot of stuff brewing up for you guys in
February
I am vlogging every day in February
they're gonna be split up though it's
not gonna be like a vlog every single
day it's just gonna be like a
compilation of clips that I will release
probably on Sunday if you guys enjoyed
this video
Oh give it a like we mean a lot and I
will see you next one bye guys
