back this is the first episode of
favorites for 2017 very exciting and if
you are a sucker for monthly favorites
like this make sure you subscribe to my
channel I do a monthly favorites every
month and I haven't missed one since I
want to say 2013 so I'm pretty committed
with that said let's get started with
the video so my first favorite is going
to be this top from Bardot this is a
really soft comfortable t-shirt with a
nice graphic it's got two x's right with
the nips are I love that even though
it's such a simplistic and minimalist
design it makes a huge statement
I actually was rocking this in my
January vlog for a couple of days and a
lot of you guys are wondering where it
was from so I thought it would be
appropriate to just stuff it in this
favorite so you guys can have the link I
also wore this shirt wow that the
woman's March a couple weeks ago and I
thought it was very appropriate there
this material is super soft so something
they can just wear around the house to a
brunch or to a March for this month I'm
super proud to announce that partnered
with audible you guys know how much I
love reading and audiobooks are no
exception for those who don't know what
audible is it's a service where you can
listen to a huge library of audiobooks
news radio the list goes on and this
month I listen to modern romance by Aziz
Ansari and if you're a fan of Aziz
you're going to freaking love this
audiobook he narrates it so perfectly he
breaks down what it's like to be dating
in this day and age and honestly our
situation is unique to say the least
we've got the invention of online dating
got Pinder we've got texting etiquette
all these things that are factors on how
we fall in love now and how that affects
us and just this whole audio book was a
lifesaver because as most of you guys
know by now I've got a sky in my eye
I to do hot compresses and it was just
nice to listen to his voice and last
while I was laying down in bed but my
styie side audiobooks are amazing
because you can just play it while
you're around the house cleaning kiting
up or when you're driving that's also
great when you're in traffic it's just
great to be entertained and have a hair
free right now audible with having a
free 30-day trial membership all you
have to do is go on audible.com slash
clothes and get started there's
literally hundreds and thousands of
options there so if you are not the type
to read or you're too lazy to read
audiobooks might be your new thing next
step I have a fashion favorite I have to
talk about these silver hoop earrings
I've just been loving the look of
obscenely large hoop earrings and this
definitely satisfies my craving what's
special about these earrings is
definitely this little rivet right in
the center I just love little details
like this but honestly you can just
probably search extra-large hoop
earrings on Amazon or Ebay and she get
something similar I want to give you a
warning that it can get a little bit or
it can be a little bit hazardous one
time when I was hanging out with my
friend this group got stuck in her
sweater so that wasn't the coolest
moment for me but sometimes I'm going to
sacrifice stuff for the look right now I
want to introduce you guys to a new
section of my favorites videos this is
going to be called the face of the month
so it's going to be a makeup looks I've
been rocking that particular month so in
January since I had my sty I wasn't able
to rock any eye makeup until it's
cleared up so this is the face of the
month this whole stage made me a lot
more minimal with my makeup so to get
this look I just skipped foundation all
together I just used concealer I used
this one by Maybelline it's their
instant age rewind concealer and I would
just pop it underneath my eyes around
the nose the mouth and I just blend that
all in then for my powder I'm still
using Rimmel stay matte I always come to
this guy no matter what powder I use I
just just nothing beats this one in my
opinion so I use that to seal it then
for my brows I use these guys from
benefit it's the goof proof brow pencil
and up precisely my brow pencil and I
just use these as like a duo and I would
take my time with my brows because since
there's nothing else on the face the
brows are all you noticed so you might
as well make them look good then for the
rest of the face i use pony effects
marvelous contour palette I really love
this bronzer because it's really light
buildable for the blush I use this nice
faded coral shade
just add a little like slight flesh on
the cheeks and then since I was lazy I
just pop this highlight on as well this
isn't the craziest of highlighters but
it's enough to give your face more of a
dewy look where the lip color I pretty
much chose anything under the Sun since
there's no eyeshadow to compete against
you can really wear whatever color that
you want but my favorite and natural
choice was this one by hourglass this is
called dreamer and this is just a nice
soft pinky coral shade this color just
my jam right now I love corals there's
something about it so yeah that was the
face of the month I am really excited
about this segment because this is going
to challenge me to really practice and
experiment with different makeup looks I
mean some will be good some will not be
as good but we'll see it's all the fun
process of it and if you guys
particularly like a look then make sure
you write it in the comments down below
so I can film a proper tutorial for you
my next area is something that I used
every single day in January and
hopefully for the rest of 2017
it is my happiness Planner I love this
body so much sorry this is like what it
looks like a Bible looks like how much
like go to church right now but I love
this guy I am definitely the type that
needs to plan whatever that's in my head
it needs to go on paper right away or
else I'll feel this weight on me that is
being xiety so planners are godsend
I actually featured this in my holiday
gift guide but just works for me so I
wanted to give you guys another shout
out because now I've actually used it
and it's been working for me so so well
I feel like I've been so much more
productive and a lot happier because of
it and let me explain why so everyday
the first thing you fill out is what
you're excited about that day so it can
be something obvious like it being New
Year's Day or or like it could be like
something simple like a clean cheeky
that's the day we could take you to the
groomers and she was very clean that day
it was very nice and then you'll have a
section of all your to do's and it only
gives you 7 slots and at first I thought
that that wasn't enough but as I'm using
this I realized that honestly 7 major
things are all I could fit in a day
anything more can just be blended to the
next day my old platter and my old
system I would literally write out every
little thing I to do from waking up
brushing my teeth making breakfast
making the bed and I feel like all that
stuff kind of almost made my life a
little bit more like convoluted because
that was remembering every little detail
every day and at first I thought that
system worked out for me but having this
system is so much more freeing and so
far I'm proud to say that I have pretty
much finished all the things I needed to
do because if there is a box that's not
tape them like and then at the end of
the day you reflect and you write the
good things about that day so for this
day
I wrote enchiladas and then the last
section is what you're grateful for and
this section gets pretty repetitive but
it makes you it makes me reflect on just
a person or something that has
positively influenced my life and I
think it's great I feel like this has
been making me a happier person for sure
and it just every day I'm excited to
fill it out because it's one thing off
the list and it gives my day structure
I know bullet journaling and trending
right now but I wish I could have like
the skill and the patience to manually
draw everything else I like the system
because it just has the entire template
out for you so you don't think about
writing out every little thing this
works for me different things work for
different people alright guys that
concludes my January favorites if you
enjoyed the video please hit the like
button and if you have any favorites or
recommendations make sure you write it
in the comments down below or you can
just write a comment and hang out every
time I upload for the first hour I try
to respond to as many comments as I can
so come say hi and I would love to hear
about your day or what you're excited
about today I'm excited about going to a
holiday party I know it's pretty late
because it's near the end of January but
since there were so many holiday holiday
parties in December they actually had a
plan it in January so everyone would be
there so I'm excited to go to that
anyway I want to thank you guys so much
for watching and I'll see you guys in
the next one
