have a festival for you I just got back
from Tokyo a couple days ago and dude
this shopping was incredible Asha and I
went to Harju ku and Shinjuku and we
shopped for like six hours that day and
needless to say that was one of the
longest shopping trips I've done in a
while and so I wanted to show you the
loot if you are a fan of hauls like this
make sure to subscribe to my channel hit
that button become a gem today and with
that said let's jump right into it so
I'm going to start with tops first here
is my first one this is a gorgeous off
the shoulder top in a nice slate color
it's got this great ruffle detail along
it and so it gives it just like a fun
fresh flirty vibe since it's so cross it
looks great with high waisted things and
I recently posted this on my Instagram
but I couldn't tag the brand but I got
this at La Follette in Tokyo my next
item is also from laforet it's this
black crop top with this fun athletic
stripes right down the center
it's got a cool metal ring detail and
it's on a zipper that functions so you
can bring it up or down wherever you
please and it's just funny that I even
have to call out that the zipper works
because there have been a number of
shirts that I've purchased where the
zipper is purely for aesthetic and not
function next up I've got this graphic
crop top from Sanada which is probably
my favorite store ever but this is a
white spaghetti strapp top and it's got
the graphic II agency makes a great trip
I don't know why but I just love when
things have improper grammar and
spelling especially on clothing it's
just I don't know it's just a nice
little touch my laptop is this huge
oversized checkered top that I'm
definitely going to be wearing as a
dress because it's long enough to do
that
I feel like checkers have been the it
print of the season I know Javon she
just had checkers in their collection
not too long ago and I feel like that's
what made it all surge back but either
way this is a really fun way to showcase
black and white and it's a really fun
nod to the ska era so now I'm going to
move on to bottom
only got one pair of shorts
unfortunately and they're these ones
they're high-waisted they're black
they've got red stripes on the sides
they also have this fun metal detail on
the side where I guess you can hook
things but I just I don't see myself
hooking anytime soon but yeah they're in
a nice breathable cotton fabric and
personally I just love the way red and
black have been looking together before
I would think like oh it's a little goth
but I I just have been really enjoying
this combination lately I also bought a
pair of trousers there are these black
high-waisted ones and the fit is just
perfect I really love shopping in Asia
because for once I'm like considered
normal size and aa petite so things just
fit better but these are so cool they're
like a nice menswear work pant but
they've got an edge because they have
this amazing metal link all across the
side I just think it's like a really
cool combination or blend between like
business professionalism and Punk now
I'm going to move on to some accessories
that I got starting with this checkered
belt and yes I got this checkered belt
and that checkered top at the same time
I got a little carried away but I don't
know I'm just living for this trend
right now
I think accessories are a really easy
way to you know test out a trend if you
like or not because it's very low risk
and just easier to incorporate so this
is the other belts that I got it's this
yellow one with grommets all around it I
love the fact that I can wear this with
high-waisted thing mid rise low-rise
dresses even because of the studs it
gives me the flexibility to wear it in
whatever size that I want and what's
needed I just grabbed a bunch of like
statement belts because they can really
just be the cherry on top of an outfit I
couldn't leave Tokyo without buying a
hatch here is this cobalt blue beret and
it's just a divine color I absolutely
love it it's like a nice good primary
blue color and I guess I'm just like on
the hunt of getting Berets in every
color and I guess blue is checked off
the list I feel like these days I've
been wearing a lot more neutral colors
so I feel like this is a really fun way
to add a pop of color for example I
would wear this with my outfit now I
think I think it looks great moving on
to jewelry I got these two pieces at the
same place the first one is this barbed
wire choker
I really like the fact that with the
class you can do it as tight or as loose
as you'd like I just I don't know I've
always been attracted to like barbed
wire I think there's something very edgy
about it and I just love me a good piece
of costume jewelry so here I have
another necklace which is also inspired
by like the punk rock era I just think
like little elements like this can
really toughen up a look like I feel
like the 13-year old me would have loved
these items and it's just funny how
fashion tends to recycle itself Oh Mike
these are also functioning handcuffs so
I could even like handcuffs suppose I
wanted to but I wouldn't but I could my
next item is hands down my favorite
thing that I purchased in Tokyo there
are these oval ray-bans with this cool
rose gold mirrored effect I do like a
double take to make sure that these were
actually by ray-ban because I've just
never seen this style before especially
created by them and I just I freaking
love it it totally has like late 90s
millennium vibes I feel like alia
would've wore these these are my first
sunglasses in this shape so that really
excites me I feel like these days for
sunglasses I'm just trying to just find
something that I've never seen before
and or at least that I don't already
have and these just take the cake for me
lastly I got a few beauty bits these are
both from a three seee which is down
nine just cosmetic line they had like a
physical store there if I was able to
like try everything out and like swatch
everything so that was amazing I picked
up this yellow eyeshadow it's in the
shade yoke and I have just been dying to
experiment with yellow eyeshadow and
this was just like my chance to finally
do it I'm wearing it on my eyes right
now and I surprisingly this is like a
really easy color to incorporate on my
face and so I'm definitely going to be
doing a makeup tutorial on this I
promise I seriously swear I know I've
missed last month's faces a month and
but but I'll have one this month I swear
then I grabbed this liquid lip color
this is in the shade tamed and it's in
this nice nudey salmon shade
I think it's like a good nude on me I am
also wearing this right now if I'm gonna
be real the formula is not amazing it's
like very dry and it leaves like a weird
white film after you wear it for a while
but I don't give a damn
Packaging is so cute and I feel like the
shade looks really good for like two or
three hours and then it just goes
downhill from there it just requires a
little bit more maintenance but if
you're willing to put in the work then I
would say get it alright guys those are
all the items that I got in Japan
definitely a really short trip I was
only there for three days and those for
work but I should have long as much as I
can so all that footage will be in the
June monthly vlog I definitely want to
make it a goal to go to Japan for at
least a week next time and then spend a
week in Korea that's like the dream and
I'm definitely going to try and make it
happen
but anyway if you guys enjoyed the video
please just the like button subscribe to
my channel
drop some love in the comments section I
would love to read about your day or
just what's going on with you also this
is a new background because then and I
moved a week ago or a week and a half
ago but yeah the move went super well
we're pretty much all on tops but like
my office needs a lot of work and also
the closets because we just need to have
more um it just needs to be more secure
because right now all the rails are are
like sinking because they can't hold
that much weight so yeah I'm just
waiting on like three wardrobes for my
Kia that's going to be very fun to build
but other than that like once that all
comes in I'll have like my life in order
all everything will be organized and
then we will shoot a home tour for you
so those are all the updates that I have
for now I am wishing you a beautiful day
and thank you for watching bye
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
