hi guys good morning it is day two of
South by Southwest but it's our first
full official day I'm super excited
yesterday was an amazing way to start
everything off my panel is at 5:30 today
so it's got some time to kill before
then um the topic of the panel is about
creating content 24/7 I think I've
actually really fitting for me because
it is a little bit of a struggle to find
a balance between creating content
filming and just enjoying them after
what it is my friend Rachel is also on
the panel with me so that makes me super
happy we are going over at 5:30 then and
I are going to go to the actual
convention center often Convention
Center to see some people
very cold I didn't prepare for this
no no I don't have any jumpers sweaters
nothing can enter my Colo hosting one
speaker negative infinity room what I
want to do
good job guys hi guys it is day three
and often a little bit of a late start
this morning but we are all dressed and
ready to go kinda like great I was super
cold but yet we had blankets and
everyone on the panel was so amazing it
was awesome to be around such inspiring
women especially in my field and I got
to meet so many of you guys thank you so
much for coming out
I wanted to give a couple of shout outs
so this portrait is by Tyra thank you so
much for this I can't wait to hang this
in my house and I can't wait to see how
you draw cheeky and over here I've got
two laser-cut pins it's a donut and a
little sushi roll and I can't wait to
put these on a denim jacket on me and

you enjoy this little South by Southwest
trip and was there for long but I really
enjoyed what I saw in Austin just
everyone was so lovely I'm so glad I got
to meet a bunch of you guys as the panel
the other day I need to go back to
Austin though because there are so many
things that we weren't able to do like a
whole slice pizza Torchy's tacos but I
know that there will definitely be a
next time
