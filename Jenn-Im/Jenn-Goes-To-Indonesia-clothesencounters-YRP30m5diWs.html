we actually had a pretty frightful
morning we woke up to an earthquake so
the entire hut was just shaking it was
like a gentle shake it wasn't like
frantic but it was enough to to notice
it and be a little alarmed because right
now we are right by the ocean like right
next to the ocean and earthquakes and
oceans there is a chance of tsunami so
we can a little worried but luckily
everything is fine but regardless I'm
still feeling a little shaken up ready

here with us
Perry PI Tina young Nene they're all
super amazing and I'm glad that we got
to have lunch before they left we are
going to see some temples today which I
am so excited about yesterday on the
drive we passed by so many small ones
and each one I was like to join for my
outfit I'm actually wearing the Four
Seasons bathrobe because I just thought
it went so well with my outfit and the
crazy thing about these shorts is I had
no idea that this parking print was such
a massive print in Indonesia than seeing
it all over the temple so I thought
that'd be short were very very fitting
for our little adventure
like is it worth much less now I'm good
seriously look how many people are here
nearly a combination J is our last day
in Bali or the last couple of hours here
really was just packing and getting
ready to go home so sad I wish I was
able to stay here I was we were able to
stay here for a couple more days and
