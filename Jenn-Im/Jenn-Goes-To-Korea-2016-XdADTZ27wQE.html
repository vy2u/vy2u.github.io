in Korea
around 7:30 a.m. we are out on the quest
for breakfast
particularly so long Tong because s o my
mom wants and I don't want because I
love dinner food for breakfast but yeah
as you can see I'm wearing the same
outfit I wore for the airport because
this is the old layout that I have they
think they found my luggage so they're
going to bring it here at 11:00 a.m. so
hopefully it comes here by 11:00 so I'll
have something else tour and how the
rest of my belongings
oh yeah going to breakfast down
yeah they found Barney what's the name
of this bag cause it's big and purple
alright guys great start to the day
got the bag back got James here hey and
we are on our way to come town which is
apparently where they're holding at the
2018 Winter Olympics but unfortunately
it's going to take three hours to get
there so we've got a road trip ahead of
us papa
three hours later and we are here in
Cong Chang we are staying at the L pen
SIA and our room is so gorgeous thought
I would do a little room tour before the
rooms just get all messed up and lived
in so let's begin
happy birthday to you happy birthday
dear ma happy birthday to you
hi guys as you can see I'm in a
beautiful place we're in Tang Wantagh
which is a temple I feel like I dressed
very accordingly this is like camouflage
for the Korean forest but yeah it is
gorgeous here this is all our first time
here so it's just like a nice family
bonding experience lots of walking I've
got my tennis shoes on so I'm ready to
just walk some miles look at nature and
breathe in the fresh air
can you explain the socks with the
sandals James it's a necessity it's all
he didn't bring a tennis shoes so this
is what he headed to someone's huh not
one that we're really here
I am
hey guys we are in Madison officially
after the long long drive today was
really just a day of travel now we're
here and of course were at Burger King
I don't even a Burger King in the States
but I saw the spicy chicken fries poster
I couldn't resist excited it is here the
time has come
oh one two three
just like this awesome like Ram should
be a better alternative that's all for
now
hi morning moaning okay we were out for
a family walk right now it is 7 a.m.
no 6 a.m. 6 a.m. Wow my aunt is taking
us to a gorgeous hiking trail and we are
in the lovely clothes on
honey there's knit
good morning everyone so now we are
about to head on a boat to go to Weddell
which is an island
my dad said there's lots and lots of
flowers there so should be very scenic
the boat is 40 minutes long apparently
so I hope that I don't get seasick I
think last night I went on a boat I got
a little bit of motion sickness so yeah
so you saw Joe form no but I mean it's
okay you'll be fine
so here is a little update for you guys
hold on you the town where they take big
big pride on their dinosaurs because
apparently there was like a giant
footprint here and every time we visit
my aunt we always pass by the dinosaur
expo and it's just been like a running
joke that we're never going to go but I
guess fate has changed and so today we
thought we would go because we're just
trying to kill time before dinner so
let's see what the hoopla is all about
all right so here we are at the infamous
dinosaur print it is fossilized and very
large and we have speculations on
whether it's real or not but I'm just
going to go ahead and assume that it's
real
straight down I used to all the pressure
No hey guys so I am really sorry because
I have been a terrible vlogger today
just so much has happened my cousin got
married I'm so happy
Congrats someone yah after the wedding
we just drove out to Seoul which was
like two hours and now we're here and
we're seeing at the Intercontinental and
Seoul next to COEX mall and the location
is prime seriously like we're just so
close to everything and I feel really
central I think right now my family and
I are gonna go do a shop because I
haven't done any shopping while I was
here so I'm due for a trip
right now and I love this place because
there's so much expression so many
performances by little people here I
would love to join in that dance group
because
I don't really know how to dance so I
think performing here would be the best
way to just kind of get outside my
comfort zone
