welcome to our beautiful room good
morning I have ordered the Thai omelet
then got the English
but these chilies will be the death of
me I freaking love these tiny little
chilies they're so hot hello everybody
today is day 1 we landed this morning
around 3 a.m. and surprisingly I feel
pretty fresh I slept pretty much the
entire plane rides here so I'm feeling
pretty good Ben and I are here with
revolve and it feels so crazy to just
start a 20-17 like this this is
incredible so far I have already had
breakfast I went to the gym today is our
free day so we pretty much could you do
whatever we want and then we have a
dinner later on tonight so this feels
really good I'm not gonna lie I feel so
happy to be here
we're here in the night market today to
grab some nipple
good morning another day another
breakfast I got the Thai stuff all again
and then got the two eggs any style and
we are currently in the bus to go to
vote oats day yeah it's boat day so we
know it's gonna be hot I'm gonna be very
burned by the next time you see me
really great I'm really excited to see
the ocean
all right for breakfast today we've got
some avocado toast a fruit platter and
then Ben got two eggs any style I'm more
free and more fruit and bread a little
bit delicate today after a very
incredible day yesterday on the boat
today we are going to the elephant
sanctuary well a lot of the elephant
rides that are here in Thailand
a lot of the elephants actually abused
and so we wanted to make it a point that
we weren't participating that at home so
we do want to see the elephants but
we're gonna go check them out in the
sanctuary the first rookies so we are on
the floor now I am just finished me up
getting ready a lot of you guys are
wondering how I did this hairstyle here
it's kind of very old Hollywood glamour
curls so these curls are very simple all
you need is a curling wand this is my
trusty one from Conair it's the you curl
I've had this since college
and so you're just gonna wrap your hair
all around the wand hold it for five
seconds and then let it cup into your
hand and you hold it here for another
like five to eight seconds the longer
you cut the curl the more spring it is
so it looks kind of crazy right now but
it's gonna drop and since it's so humid
outside these curls are gonna drop like
crazy so by the time of outside it's
gonna look very natural and just kind of
effortless and you just need to curl all
your hair in the same direction and
that's pretty much it
alright here is done and now I'm going
to apply this super power or sunscreen
mousse it's got SPF 50 and I love it
it's kind of like a shaving cream okay
it doesn't smell like sunscreen
meuk kind of dies but it doesn't have
that quintessential cool smell which is
nice
I actually got kind of a tan yesterday
on the boat so when I try and even out
these lines so this is my outfit today I
am wearing a right yellow dress from
privacy please there's just a little
easy to easy little guy alright so here
we are at the elephant sanctuary oh my
god I know we already saw three
elephants and I'm about to get closer to
one so the good thing about this place
is like a retirement home for elephants
I have been abused or been through stuff
so it's like they're treating really
well and it's just
speaking of elephant
all right so this is our dinner
situation right now dinner by the
seaside wow this looks so delicious
is so sad it's already over like it's
been the quickest five or six days of my
life today we are turning yacht day I
didn't know what would top boat day but
today we are on this incredible yacht
it is absolutely massive there are three
stories on this guy and it's been
incredible we are going island hopping
today we're gonna have lunch love
islands that I can or just go do some
sightseeing
all right we are at our first island
this is Kai and milk island and it is so
what do you feel about this island so
far lower low first impressions it's
very nice it's lots of activities lots
of options to do things here
hello everybody today is our final day
in Phuket
we're leaving back to the United States
in a couple hours our flight is at 6
p.m. and I've got a couple hours left
we've had a really relaxing and a
peaceful morning we had breakfast at the
lobby it was really beautiful
I had another Thai stuff omelette it has
been my jam here that and the sliced
Thai chilies that has been delicious
it's so spicy but it doesn't give me
heartburn so I think I found my perfect
fit for me honestly this trip has been
so incredible I wanted to share with you
guys a couple of my favorite moments
first was being on the boat with Ben we
were laying down on the Sun beds and I'm
just looking up at the sky the wind was
rushing around and it just made me
realize it just made it more aware that
I was on a boat in the middle of the
ocean in Thailand and it was just a
really surreal moment for me also the
Elephant Sanctuary was incredible
do you have any words to say about the
elephant industry certain amount of
awareness for the how part the trade is
yeah the trucking industry it's horrible
whenever you see an elephant that is
forced to paint or do tricks please know
that the elephants were tortured for a
long time in order for them to be
domesticated and lose their spirit yeah
they literally break them down until
they they want to give up and that's
when they cut the power over them and it
was so sad to see but at the same time
it's so nice to see that their sanctuary
is that like the one we went to where
they actually bring in you know abused
and elderly and disabled Islands flying
elephants and let them live the rest of
their life like freely and happily and
so that was really nice very inspiring
very emotional Cecina it was
unbelievable experience there was no got
to eat them too
I know goobers and bananas yeah oh yeah
that was really incredible yeah that was
amazing but this trips been so good uh
but yeah even though the trip is coming
to an end I am very excited to go home
as well we're good to see it'll just be
nice to be in our home again get a
little routine oh by the way I'm gonna
pack up and get ready to go to the
airport
