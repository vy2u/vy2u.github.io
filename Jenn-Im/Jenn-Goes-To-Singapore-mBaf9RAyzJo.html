(screams)
- [Ben] Wow.
- We made it!
17 hours later and we're
here thanks to Etude House.
I'm so excited to be back in Singapore.
We're staying at the Mandarin hotel
and this is Ben's very
first time in Singapore.
- Yeah, it's my first time.
I've always wanted to come here.
I can't believe how it's
like the greenest city
I've ever seen.
- Yeah, I didn't realize,
I think I forgot how green it is.
It's so beautiful.
- We've only got two days
so we're gonna make the most of it.
17-hour flight, feeling
a little bit sweaty.
- Yeah, I feel really sweaty.
- A little bit sweaty.
- I think right now we're
just gonna get freshened up
and really enjoy our free day here.
- Yeah, just want to explore Singapore.
I mean, even this hotel rooms big enough
so we gotta explore this first.
(upbeat music)
- Okay so here is a hotel
tour at the Mandarin.
We have an Etude sign welcoming us.
With the conference
room or our living area,
they have showered us with
lots of decadent sweets.
- [Ben] Just what we want.
Look at that.
- Dining area.
A beautiful view of the skyline.
- Okay if we both have
to go to the restroom
we have the option of going
into this one over here.
- [Ben] There's one.
- And now this is the other section.
- [Ben] Wow.
- We've got the restroom
here, pretty standard.
We've got a shower, bath,
and we have all these lovely
Etude products to try.
We've got some body lotion.
Some eye patches right over here.
I love this brush, how cute is this?
- [Ben] Basically didn't
need to pack anything.
- And now for the bedroom.
It's gorgeous.
And over here we've got the vanity.
And I've already dug
through some of the makeup.
I've used this lip color,
which is their Matte Chic lip color
and this is in the shade Too Much Orange.
Which is debatable.
You can never have too much orange
but I'm wearing it on my lips right now
and I love the color.
I can't wait to try out
more of their products.
I already love their foundation
which I'm also wearing right now.
I'll do a get ready with me later.
Alright, so we're in
Singapore and of course,
we had to go to a Starbucks.
I got a black ice tea unsweetened
and Ben got a mushroom spinach quiche.
- Yeah, don't judge us yet.
You know we're gonna have proper food.
We just got here, we need something quick.
And I'll tell you what the Starbucks,
the veggie options over here,
they're already better
than everyone else so.
- Alright, we are on the road now.
We are going to do some sight seeing.
Basically are wonderful driver, Hafitha,
is gonna show us around
and he has pretty much
picked out the best spots.
We're gonna go to the Marina Sands area.
- Yeah.
- Where the Merlion is
and then he's going to
take us to the skyline
where you can see half of
Singapore and also Indonesia.
- We have the best tour guide
with us so thank you Hafitha.
(laughs)
(relaxing music)
Merlion's just here.
It's lovely.
- We did it.
- Bloody boiling but it's lovely.
- I remember I was here, I want
to say four years ago, 2014.
And I did like a little spinning clip
right where the Merlion was
so a lot of memories here.
I'm so happy that Ben
gets to come here with me.
He's already having such
an amazing time here.
Can't wait for us to actually
have some Singaporean food.
Alright so we are at
destination spot number two.
We are at Marina Barrage.
It's basically like a
beautiful pristine park
in the middle of the bay.
- This is unbelievable.
- Alright up on the menu,
I went for the chicken rice special.
Ben got some veggie dumplings
and shrimp spring roll I believe.
And lunch time.
- My body clock's all over the place.
- I know right.
I don't even want to know what time it is.
- It doesn't matter, we're
just having a lovely time.
- I had chicken rice and
ben had vegetarian dumplings
and a shrimp roll.
- Very good.
- It's great.
- And this is delicious.
- Chendol?
Chendol.
- Hafitha, our lovely driver
suggested this dessert
which is amazing.
I haven't had anything like it.
- It reminds me of like Korean
shaved ice like patbingsu
but with like jello and...
- Mmm.
(upbeat music)
- Hey guys.
- Hello, a little
update, we went shopping.
We bought nothing.
Tried on some things but
now we're having drinks
with our friend Ash at the Dempsey.
- It's a very nice little area.
It's very chill, still very warm here
but we're looking forward to a drink,
get rid of that jet lag.
We've been up for a long time
we've been doing a lot
today so we deserve it.
- [All] Cheers!
- Yay, to reunions!
My mouth is salivating so much.
Gotta get started, right?
- [Ben] Yes.
- [Jen] Whoa.
- [Ben] As you guys know we had dinner
but why not have another, look at that.
Oh!
- Good morning everybody!
It is my second and final day in Singapore
although I feel like we've
been here for so much longer
because yesterday we did so much.
We literally did all the activities.
I feel really lucky that I've
got so many friends out here
and they're all so nice.
Like I love Ashley and I love Winnie
and they both just showed
us a great time out.
Today is the official meet and greet event
with Etude House and so
I'm just getting ready.
I already put foundation on.
I'm using a Etude House's
Double Lasting Foundation
and I'm the shade of tan.
And I used this foundation
yesterday as well
and it held up through the entire day.
Like all I to do is powder my T-zone
and other than that everything just stayed
and we were up until like midnight
so we had a very full day.
I might have to just not
do this get ready with me
because I am meeting with the
photographer in 30 minutes
and I needed like do my
hair and all this stuff
and chit-chatting and
getting ready is actually...
I don't know, I feel like I....
(laughs)
I feel like I'm just going to check in
with you guys after
because I just need to...
focus on the speed and the agility.
So I'll see you guys in a second
and I'll fill you guys in
but good morning.
Alright so I had a fast
forward a little bit
because I wanted to
really speed up the eyes
because I'm a little bit on a time crunch
and doing my brows and eyes
really requires a lot of concentration.
But for my eyes I used this
palette by Etude House.
This is their Play
Color Eyes in juice bar.
And I put this orange
shade all over my lids.
I definitely recommend using your finger.
This reminds me of kind of
like the color pop eyeshadows
because with a brush you
don't get as much coverage
as you would with your fingers.
So you just kind of dig
your finger in like that
and then pat it all over the eyes.
I put it on the outside
and underneath as well
and then I blended it out
with this shade over here,
which is kind of like just
your natural peachy shade.
And I really like the way it looks.
It looks very orangy and summery
and it just reminds me of Singapore.
Every time I go to Singapore,
it just feels really fresh and bright
and so I wanted my makeup to reflect that.
I added a little bit
of glitter with Stila.
This is the rose gold retro
to add a little bit of shine
and now I am...
I guess I'm just gonna contour.
I'm rushing because I
have booked in a shoot
with a photographer named John.
He's only 19 years old and
I saw his work on Instagram
and he is so talented.
His work looks very surreal
and I don't know if he like shoots on film
or he does like an effect where
it looks like it's on film
but I dig his style
and I can't wait to see
how the photographs look.
He's meeting me at my
hotel in like 30 minutes
so I am just trying to get
ready as quickly as I can.
I'm slapping on some orange blush
because I am just going
for the orange look.
This might be a little bit too much blush
but it is what it is.
I love shooting with new photographers
because I like to see their
perspective on everything
and it's really cool to see how
everyone shoots differently.
And it's crazy how the
way one person shoots
can look so differently
from another person's
and so it's really fun and interesting.
Like I think before I used
to get kind of anxious
when I shot with new people
but when you do it long enough,
you just power through, you know?
You got your like five
poses and you work with it
and you see what the photographer can do.
So yeah, I think Ben and I are gonna try
and get some like a
couple of shots as well.
I think we're gonna use those
for the wedding perhaps,
we'll see.
For mascara I'm using at
Etude House's Curl Fix.
I've spoken about this in a,
I think a get ready with
me or a favorites video
but I love this.
This is amazing for humid weather
because it is so waterproof
and it just makes all my tiny lashes
just stick straight up, which I love.
This is gonna be great
for my bottom lashes
because I can really get in there.
Wow.
Currently Ben is out and about.
He is getting us a coffee
and he just wanted to
get some extra drone shots of Singapore.
Like honestly, this city is so
photogenic, it's ridiculous.
Like I haven't seen like an
ugly sight of Singapore at all.
Like everything is just so lush, green.
I love the variety in architecture here
because there's like some really cool
like modern looking buildings
and right next door could be
like a temple looking building
and then right next door is like more of
like a colonial European-style building.
So it's really cool seeing all these
different types of buildings
in one concentrated area.
So yeah, so he's been having
such a blast grabbing content
and I just feel so happy that Ben is
really getting engrossed in videography.
Like I just love seeing
people who are passionate
and he is just in this
beast mode with videography.
Like when we flew here,
he pretty much edited the entire time
and so I think that just like solidified
my thoughts of him just loving this.
so I'm really happy for him
and kind of helps me
out too, which is great.
it's like a win-win situation.
ALright guys, I'm gonna
talk to you guys in a bit.
I'm just gonna finish up
and then we'll talk when the
photo shoot happens I guess.
(piano music)
- A restaurant called Fish &amp;amp; Co.
And I got the piri piri
fish and it's so delicious.
- We've got about 15 minutes
so we need to go back to the hotel
and then get ready for the meet and greet.
- Woo-hoo.
- Hello, guys.
I am here at the Etude House in Singapore
and I am at the Color Factory.
So over here we've got all
the beautiful lip colors that they have.
The Color Factory is really cool
because you get a whole
customizable experience.
Makeup artist is about
to determine my skin tone
and find out what lip color
suits my skin tone the best
and this is really weird for me
because I already know what color I want.
Like probably this one.
This is my jam but I'm curious to know
what is actually like
suitable for my skin tone.
So I mean, I'm hoping for a coral
but we'll see what I actually get.
Yes!
This is my jam.
I love all of these.
I'm so excited.
- [Ben] Nice and confident.
- Oh, what?!
(laughs)
(gasps)
My final color is this one.
I absolutely love it,
it's on my lips right now
and now I get to pick a packaging,
which I'm super excited.
Initially I wanted the French Fries one
because I love french fries.
Wallie would love this as well.
And I do love the hot sauce
because I'm a spicy girl
but aesthetic reasons, I love
the sea foam and the pink.
So I'm gonna go for the matches.
This is my finished lipstick shade.
Wearing it on my lips right now
and check this out, you
get your own engravement.
- Please join me in welcoming on stage,
YouTube celebrity Jenn Im.
(audience cheering)
Welcome Jenn, welcome welcome.
(audience screaming)
This is crazy.
Say something to them outside.
- Thank you so much for coming.
This means the absolute world.
I love Singapore so
much so I'm so grateful
that you guys chose to come.
Thank you.
(audience cheering)
My goodness, this is insane.
I feel super excited.
- [Ben] There's a lot of people here.
I know, it's a big adrenaline rush.
I'm so excited to meet everybody!
(audience applauding)
Thank you so much.
All finished, I can't
believe the turn out!
Such a beautiful, well organized event.
The Virgo in me is beaming right now.
Oh my gosh.
Okay, so we just got
back to the hotel room
and my god, what a day it's been.
I truly feel so like filled with love.
The amount of people that showed up
and came and supported
and sent their love is just overwhelming
and I just feel so, so
grateful for you guys.
Just look at this.
This is a physical manifestation
of all your love and support.
Thank you so much.
Like check out all these snacks.
Mmm!
We even got some hot Cheetos here.
I didn't even know you can
get hot Cheetos in Singapore.
I heard it's very rare
so thank you so much.
I am excited to try these things.
These potato crisps with sour cream.
These look delicious.
These chicken rice chips look delicious.
I've got this cute, oh
my god, it's so soft.
- [Ben] Present for Cheeki as well.
- [Jenn] I know, little collar for Cheeki.
- [Ben] She's gonna like that.
- [Jenn] I've got some lashes here.
Oh my gosh, sleep mask, a purse.
Herbal tea that's been helping my throat.
- We've got 12 hours left in Singapore.
I think we can do this.
I think we can eat the lot.
- [Jenn] Seriously.
And over here we've got some letters.
These are personally my favorite
because I could always
take these back home
and oh, look at this!
Babe, it's us.
This is literally gonna be us in 24 hours.
- [Ben] Cheeki getting jealous
that we're hanging out.
- I met Grecia who's
such a huge supporter.
She always comments on all
my videos, she's so sweet.
Oh, look at these letters.
Oh, this is, this is just too much
and I just personally want to say that
gifts are not necessary at any meet up.
Seriously, like I just am blown away
but letters, letters are so sweet
because I feel like meet ups
can be quite short and snappy
but with letters I can truly take my time
and read them get to know you guys.
So thank you so much for
everyone that showed up
and said your support.
- [Ben] It's been amazing
everyone's been so nice and calm
and everyone was amazing today
so it's a very smooth day.
And like Jenn said, it's always so hard
because you want to talk to everyone
and you feel bad when
you got a rush off but
yeah everyone's been amazing
so it's good to meet you all.
