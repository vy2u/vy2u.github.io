- Morning, today we are
heading to Amangiri!
I'm so excited, we are taking JetSuite.
So, it's my first time on a jet.
There is no TSA.
We can stroll right in.
(soft, relaxing music)
Hello everybody!
- Hi guys.
- We are here with our Revolve fam.
It's always a great time with them.
We're just going to explore the hotel.
This is the Amangiri.
It's stunning.
(upbeat electronic music)
Welcome to our humble abode
for the next three days.
(laughs)
The restroom, this is my sink, my clothes.
(soft electronic music)
Cheers!
- Cheers to my favorite man Daniel.
- [Jenn] Hey Daniel!
- [Ben] We've missed him.
- Good to be back.
- Its 6:06, we have
welcome drinks at 6 p.m.
We're very, very punctual.
First ones here.
- [Ben] We're always punctual
when it comes to alcohol.
- Yeah, that's true.
(upbeat electronic music)
Good morning.
I got the poached eggs,
breakfast potatoes,
and chicken sausage, got a pancake,
and Ben got the two eggs, any style.
(relaxing music)
All right, we're off!
(laughter)
(upbeat electronic music)
The drone is out.
The D is out.
- [Ben] No, you can't call it D.
- Yes, we made it the
D 'cause we're not sure
if he can bust out his D out here, so--
- Some people don't want to see my D.
- Yeah, well technically it's Wa's D.
(laughs)
- Yeah that's true.
I'm just handling Wa's D for him.
- (laughs) Yeah.
(upbeat electronic music)
We're here at the Horseshoe Canyon.
It is absolutely breathtaking.
(soft electronic music)
- [Ben] Let's put the hot sauce near you.
- Yes! (laughs)
Good morning.
- Yesterday was such an amazing day.
- It really was.
- It went through so fast.
- I know, we were out and about all day.
We went to the Canyon Slot tours.
So stunning, thank you.
It's so crazy that the Earth
just looks like that naturally.
- It doesn't, it looks like we're on Mars.
Being from like, London,
you don't see stuff like this.
It's so vast, isn't it?
Even just looking at the view here.
It looks like the size of England.
- Today we are, I believe
we are just going to
take a dip in the pool in the morning,
and then--
- Yeah, and we are doing
that dune buggy things.
I'm excited about that.
- But yeah, today should be a really,
another great day.
(relaxing music)
Okay, thank you.
(laughter)
(upbeat music)
All right.
What is gonna happen to us?
Here we go!
(upbeat music)
- [Ben] How you doing, babe?
- Doing good, headed home.
We are dusty.
- [Ben] Very dusty.
- Yeah, (laughs) enjoying the nature.
(upbeat music)
'Bout to head into the helicopter.
We've got these emergency pouches,
and they actually look pretty stylish.
Don't you think?
- [Ben] And we're literally having lunch
on that tiny little pillar over there.
You can't quite see it,
but we're landing on that, apparently.
(upbeat electronic music)
- Can you guys hear my gum chewing?
(relaxing music)
All right, so we made it to Tower View.
You know that clip of the giant mountain?
He landed on it, and we
made it in one piece!
The pilot put on some tunes.
We listened to Bob
Marley and some Coldplay,
to keep the vibes light.
- Like, this is the
craziest helicopter ride
I've ever been on in my entire life.
- [Jenn] It's the only helicopter,
just kidding. (laughs)
- [Ben] It's also the worst.
- [Philip] Yeah, it's also
the worst helicopter ride.
(upbeat music)
- [Ben] Come on Philip, you've got this.
- I got this.
Oh God. (laughs)
(upbeat electronic music)
- Revolve!
- [Jenn] Oh my God!
