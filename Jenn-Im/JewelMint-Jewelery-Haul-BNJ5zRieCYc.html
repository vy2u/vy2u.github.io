today we're excited to tell you guys
about Joel mint kate bosworth and share
Coulter's jewelry line
yeah it's Joel that comes in these fun
little cute boxes and they're this nice
like mint color and what's really cool
about the website is that there is a
little like personality style place they
can take and so you can pick out like
what kind of style fun that you like and
just like random like you're gonna have
like pictures like eight purses and then
you pick out well purse like the bust
and etc and after it takes it to a
showroom and just kind of matches out
like jewelry that they think that you
might like and they did a pretty good
job like matching our Styles yeah
there's a lot of I'm gonna take those
kind of quizzes just so after we show
you the pieces that they match this up
with we're gonna show you how to do
outfits and meet with them one of the
pieces that Jill met matched me up with
was this in the rough ring and it's just
as big black stone with a dull brass
ring and it's really nice because the
doll Ross is like low-key so you could
wear in the daytime but it's a big
statement ring so you could wear it at
night and look really sophisticated nice
what Joey matched me up with were these
Bermuda earrings and they're so cool
because it's just a bunch of little
triangles creating one big triangle and
there's little triangle spreads on the
bottom so it's really elegant because
it's a dangly earring but also very
funky too because the color scheme is
super cool because the yellow really
pops out and I also don't really have
that much yellow in my wardrobe anyway
so I think that'd be really fun to try
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
