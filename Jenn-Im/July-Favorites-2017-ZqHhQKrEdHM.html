today I have an episode of favorites
because August is slowly creeping on up
and so I thought I would just gather all
my favorite things of July and share
them to you like I do every single month
like honestly favorites are just like a
tradition and routine at this point and
if you don't want to miss the single
episode of favorites
make sure you subscribe to my channel
the bottom is down below hit that become
a gem today and let's get started so I'm
going to start with a couple of fashion
bits first if you've been watching my
videos this year or this summer then you
know that ice hockey mules like nobody's
day of business and here is one of my
favorite pairs this is one from Jeffrey
Campbell and actually love how little
the heel is it's maybe like like 1.5
inches and it's all I need just that
little extra pet on days where I want to
be a little bit fancier I've got this
option right over here these are my
dusty blue suede mules from Ray and
these just give me like Marie Antoinette
vibes it's definitely the color and the
texture as well it's just so chic and
cute and I just love mules because
they're kind of like the chic version of
a flip-flop you can slip in and out of
them and look good doing so so this year
I promised myself that 2017 was going to
be a year of self growth and so that's
why I've just been immersing myself with
self-help books and that's why I have
been so happy that I've partnered with
audible because I've been exposed to so
many different types of audiobooks if
you don't know what audible is it is a
service where you just have like a
massive library filled with audiobooks
podcasts radio stuff everything under
the Sun and one audio book that I
finished is the subtle art of not giving
a by Mark Manson and I know that
the title is like kind of jarring a
little douchey but I swear this book is
not like that whatsoever I love that
it's not like your average self-help
book where it's kind of like be positive
like self a negative or just be
confident in yourself like it's not just
half-ass advice I really like his
approach because it's very raw and
realistic and that's just what I prefer
one huge
way that I took away from this book it
was idea that there is always going to
be problems in your life no matter what
and I know that this is just a very
obvious piece of advice but it is a
lesson that really sunk in with me after
I listened to this and there was like
one really good quote in this book that
just really stuck with me and I'm going
to read it out to you because I don't
want to mess it up don't hope for a life
without problems there's no such thing
instead of hope for a life full of good
problems you are defined by what you're
willing to struggle for and I just love
this mentality because it's so real I
don't know like the past years or in the
past few years of my adult life I feel
like I was always just kind of like
running through the motions of fixing
problem solving problems like dealing
with the problem and then solving the
problem and it really felt just never
ending because it is and I guess I
always solve problems as like a negative
thing like oh like of course another
thing went wrong but that's just what
life is it happens in life and it's just
all about the way you deal and handle
situations and sometimes the problem is
actually a blessing and I feel like this
concept really just stuck with me and
it's helped me immensely and there's so
many other great things about this book
this has been an amazing audiobook to
just get ready to clean that house with
I know a lot of people struggle with
finding the time to read a book but with
an audiobook you can really pop one on
whatever and it's good to multi-task
your brain as a powerful thing you can
do a lot of things if you want to check
this out make sure you head on over to
audible.com slash clothes they're doing
a 30 day free trial so please check it
out
they have so many different types of
genres and if you don't like a book
you can always switch it out so it's
kind of like a library but with
audiobooks my next favorite is an
accessory that I have not left my body
since I've gotten it it's this nameplate
from Amarillo
I just love dainty and delicate pieces
like this like this chain is everything
it's so glimmery
it's so soft and very feminine and I
just actually really love the way that
the name isn't all caps normally
nameplate necklaces they're like in
cursive but I feel like this is like a
nice little twist and because it's
summer obviously my
we're we're tones are coming out so I
feel like the gold really brings that
out I just feel like it adds like a
perfect little extra oomph to every
outfit I love you guys were wondering
where I was from so I thought I would
you know shout it out next up I want to
chat about a skincare product as you
know I've just been kind of like hoppin
around with eye creams I the last one
that I liked was Korres is black pine
eye serum but I wanted to find something
that was just like a little bit thicker
and richer and that's where Sicilies eye
contour mask comes in I finally got my
hands on this after I used it from my
sight Ashley she likes swears by this
stuff it did puff her eyes and she used
it like all throughout college um until
now and so I finally you know sit the
kool-aid and I get it
so I use this in the morning in the
night and I used to never wear eye
creams in the day but just I don't know
maybe it's just the way like my
concealer was starting to set but just
something didn't feel hydrated enough
and this just completely solved that
I'll just apply like a little tiny dot
underneath both eyes and my eyes just
feel brighter and also my concealer just
sets better now that I have this on my
base and yeah I have been using this for
like over a month now and I've been even
sharing with Ben and I want to use like
this amount so even though it is like a
bit of an investment I feel like this is
going to last me a very very long time
for my movie favorite I have the film
get out I know I am so late on
recommending this but you know what
better late than never
I finally got to watch it with Ben we
saw it on like Apple TV and literally
after the film I was just like oh my god
this is one of my favorite movies I
would say it's definitely on my top 5
films for sure and I feel like the last
time I saw a movie this good was
probably like ex machina and just well
these are so freakin good so I guess
like technically it's like a horror film
but like if you are scared of horror
films like this is not going to scare
you because there's just so many other
elements to it like it's super funny
it's thrilling and it's kind of like a
psychological vendor highly recommend
this like a quick summary is
there's a couple and then finally
getting into the relationship where
they're going to meet each other's
families and you know they're in an
interracial relationship so there's you
know a couple differences and I will
just leave it at that
because it's one of those movies where
the less you know the better
so definitely go check it out it's
obviously on Apple TV pretty sure it's
on Amazon - so my last favorite is also
something that helps with you know self
growth I've been using this app called
headspace for the past 27 days and I
have just been obsessed with it because
I feel like it's been changing my life
for the better so headspace is an app
where they do guided meditation and just
improves your mindfulness so when I
first downloaded headspace I just had
like the free version so like each of
the medications were like three to five
minutes long they're very peaceful but
like after the third day like they
aspect would you like to buy the premium
package and I was like yes I do
and once I bought that one just a slew
of like huge packages just came in so my
packages I mean they're like guided
meditations that focus on different
things you want to work on so for
example I've downloaded self-esteem
basics creativity happiness patience and
the list goes on and you can do a guided
meditation every single day right now I
am doing the self-esteem one and I know
a lot of you guys think I like super
confident but you know your girl gets in
her head a lot and this is something
I've just been dying to work on and I
feel like headspace has really really
been helping so each of these guided
meditations are 20 minutes long and I
know like it seems like a long time and
honestly it kind of is but that's 20
minutes that are just for you and I
think a way to just make sure that you
do a meditation everyday is just by kind
of slipping it into your normal routine
so I like to meditate after I've
breakfast I'll go back into my bed and
I'll like make my bed and I'll sit on it
and then I'll just do my guided
meditation one day I would love to be
able to meditate without having like
someone guide me but I feel like this is
making me closer to my goal and this is
something that I want to incorporate for
my routine as long as I possibly can all
right guys that reps
my July favorites if you're looking for
some music recommendations please head
on over to my Spotify playlist which is
located in the description box please
hit that I've been adding new songs like
every so often just to keep it you know
buy stuff it's mostly just summer jams
easy songs that you can listen to while
you're getting ready or driving go check
it out also I feel like the lighting is
just progressively getting worse because
it's like I don't know it's just a very
cloudy day today so I'm sorry so it just
got super dark at the end I know a lot
of you guys don't care but it's driving
me a little crazy if you have any
recommendations that you want to share
with me or anybody else write in the
comments down below I love when everyone
is just sharing and dumping stuff that
inspires them I I just love that so if
you can drop some love share what you've
been loving feel free to do that I want
to wish you guys a beautiful day and
I'll see you guys to the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
