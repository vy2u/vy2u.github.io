today I have an episode of favorites I
can't believe it's already time to do
one of these but we are well into summer
and I thought I would showcase some
items that have made this month even
better
also if you love favorite videos like
this make sure you're subscribed to my
channel you button is down below so make
sure you hit that become a gem today so
with that said let's get started so I
got to talk about some accessories that
I've been loving here I have these
dangly guys from the brand Inc I grabbed
these at Macy's and if you follow me on
Instagram these earrings are no stranger
to you and popping them on like nobody's
business I actually love these so much
that I got three pairs it's not very
often that I do this I've been really
liking to mix and match them as well
they add like a nice movement around the
face and just the perfect pop of colors
to any outfit as you guys know I moved
and with this process I had to figure
out what I would do for my jewelry
storage for my last place it wasn't
really that good of a system I had these
clear boxes but the jeweler was getting
all tangled up it was rusting and it
wasn't a good look so finally I have
found my solution for my jewelry storage
it is this the jewelry on law it is
amazing I am so happy with it it looks
like a mirror from the outside but when
you open it
boom got storage for everything my
earrings my bracelets my rings my
necklaces it's just perfect and I'm so
happy that I finally have a system again
because it's so easy to like mix and
match my earrings now like all my
chokers in one place it just feels good
to have like a nice system I got this
that hey needle and if I'm going to be
completely honest it was it was kind of
like a struggle to get this so the first
time it arrived it came broken the
hinges fell off and it was just annoying
like calling customer service being like
hey it ain't broken but they took it
away and they shut me a new one and
while it was shipping I was reading
everyone's reviews and a lot of people
at the same issue the first time it
comes broken some people's mirrors were
shattered some people have the same
issues that I did
the hinges coming off there was one user
there that had to order this three times
for it came like in one piece but
luckily for me the second time I arrived
it was in perfect condition thank God so
if you are interested in getting this
arm wha just repaired to have it come
broken at least one time because this
isn't made from like the best material
it's going to have some wear and tear
from the from the move so I'm just
letting you guys know that as like a
heads up for my makeup favorite I have
steel as liquid eyeshadow in molten
midnight
these were everywhere on YouTube was a
couple months ago everyone was just
freaking out about them obviously I am
late to the bandwagon I saw my girl
Sophia use this in one of her tutorials
and I was the day that I was just
convinced I put it in my cart and I have
no regrets I've been rocking this
eyeshadow look like a fair amount of
times in June but this is like the
perfect thing if you love glitter and I
love me some glitter this is great
because you can really pinpoint exactly
where you want the sparkle and it
doesn't have fallout which is a godsend
because usually when I'm working with
glitter it just kind of gets all over
the place so when it's concentrated and
it's controlled it's always a good look
this is a black eyeshadow with gold and
silver flecks and I'm rocking it on my
eyes right now I am definitely going to
so much tutorial on this look so stay
tuned because this is perfect for like
summer nights out date night or just any
time you just want to add a little glam
moving on to more accessories I have to
feature these sunglasses by perverse
these are called the Eva and I am just
obsessed with them I recently found this
in my summer lookbook if you haven't
watched that video I'll leave it in the
card right there
but these sunglasses give me life like
when I put them on I just feel happier
because the world just looks more
vibrant and just better in general it's
definitely like a mood enhancer and I
think you look pretty cool while wearing
them
these are oversized so I think they
would really suit anyone's face and just
like a really fun summer staple I'm
thinking about filming a styling tinted
sunglasses video because at this point
I've collected around maybe four or five
so I think I'm gonna I think I'm going
to do it let me know if you're
interested
in the comments down below if you open
my closet you'll notice that I only have
one type of hanger it's these velvet
space-saving ones these are incredible
if you just have like the plastic or the
wood ones I highly suggest you convert
and invest into these because you can
hang so much more clothing with these
hangers but these hangers are actually
not my favorite I want to talk about
these clips be there by huggable hangers
I got these at Target and these are
clips that you just attach to the bulb
it was and boom you can instantly hang
all your like strapless tops you can
hang your skirts and your shorts and for
the longest time I didn't really have
like a good system for storing my skirts
and skirts are like a big part of summer
you know and before I was just folding
them up and putting them in a dresser
and just like literally forgetting about
them now I have these hangers they're
all hung up in my closet I can see
everything and now styling is just so
liberating because I have to dig into I
should my like my dressers to find like
that one skirt from months ago so it's
just nice to have everything in one
place I absolutely love it my next
favorite is such a mom favorite but I
got to mention anyway it's my new Dyson
vacuum cleaner
my parents got it for me and been as a
housewarming gift and FFL is like oh we
already have a vacuum cleaner but Ben
was like no babe this is the best vacuum
cleaner and I tried it out and literally
life-changing I I mean I already love
cleaning but this has made the process
even better like it sucks up everything
it has all these different heads so you
got like the normal traditional vacuum
cleaner you've got like the nozzles you
can get in the nooks and crannies it's
just such an effective tool just sucks
up everything and also it doesn't have a
cord so you can take it anywhere you can
vacuum your car I think vacuuming the
steps it's just I just the love for this
vacuum cleaner is just awesome like when
I first got this vacuum fader I
literally spent the rest of the night
vacuuming the stairs and just I went a
little nuts so I knew that I had to plug
it in my favorite if I'm going to be
real this is pretty expensive I looked
it up and also
can think of it as investment because
this with this you're going to have a
really clean home and you're never going
to need like a broom or a dustpan
it just makes cleaning a lot easier and
when you have a clean environment you
got a clear mind so just things to think
about my last favorite is a summer
playlist that I created with Spotify I
will leave the link down below
I just really created like a mishmash of
all my favorite songs that I've been
listening to so check it out there's
just a lot of different types of genres
in there too and I'm just going to be
adding more songs as the summer goes on
so feel free to follow it and if you
have any summer songs that you have been
just playing on repeat leave it in the
comments down below I love listening to
your guide recommendations it's like one
of my favorite pastimes alright everyone
those were my June favorites I literally
can't believe were in July now this year
is just zooming by so quickly I am just
living for the summer though this is my
favorite season it's hot now in LA it's
like a nice dry heat and just it's just
always been my favorite season if you
