today's video is going to be about
Korean beauty and skincare I'm going to
do a haul and a demo on all these
products here it's been a while since
I've done a video like this so I thought
it was about time that I do one also if
you are a lover of K Beauty make sure
you're subscribed to my channel it takes
a second or less than a second to become
a gem so with that said let's get
started so I'm going to run through some
skincare items first here I have the egg
mousse soap by too-cool-for-school
and I've actually used another product
from this line it was called the egg
mousse pack which is like a mask for
your face and this product is pretty
similar especially the texture so what
you do is you shake the bottle of very
well and you score it maybe like a golf
ball size onto your palm and it's really
thick and bouncy and moussey it's almost
like a meringue and what I'll do is just
I'll just apply it all around my face
kind of massage it and then rinse it off
with warm water I would highly recommend
that you use an oil-based makeup remover
or like a makeup light first before
using this because this on its own
doesn't do a good job removing makeup so
as already double cleanse this products
great next step I've got this exfoliator
by neo Jen and I've also used this part
in the past but their red wine version
they came out with a lemon one for how
to try it it's super refreshing and I
love using in the morning
alright just love the way the smells but
I'll use this after I wash my face and
then I'll grab one of these pads and
then using the rough coarse side I'll
use that to just kind of gently massage
and exfoliate everything away and I'll
do that for maybe 20 to 30 seconds
and then I'll flip it to the back and
this is like a nice quilted side and
then I'll use that to kind of pick up
all the debris and just kind of I don't
know it just like a nice sensation to do
it's also part of the directions and
after I will rinse once more and then my
face is exploited and just baby soft
I'll use this maybe two or three times a
week nothing more than that because you
don't want to over exfoliate but it is
important to do so because when you
don't exfoliate like when you layer like
different products like serums and
creams it's not fully sinking into your
skin
so when you exfoliate it's kind of like
raking the leaves away and that way the
product just really sinks in next step
I've got this mask by dr. jart this is
their clear skin lover and I love their
masks because they're so easy to pop on
and I feel like they're very effective
this one I like to use during that time
in a month went on flows in town that's
the only time where I start breaking out
but I feel like with this mask it really
keeps all the pimples like under control
there's like a little packet with the
like product inside and so I'll just
kind of like slather it all over my face
and once that's on there I'll open up
the actual mask and this is like a very
delicate mask so if you've got long
nails you're probably going to puncture
it but don't worry if you get holes in
it it's fine and then you just kind of
let everything marinate for 15 to 20
minutes and then I'll peel it off and I
know some people they just like to leave
all the product on their face I like to
rinse it off because it's just it's just
a lot of product so I'll rinse it off
and then I'll do essence and my serums
and my night creams but that's like I'll
save that for my skincare routine so now
I'm going to we wanted some makeup
products the first brand I'll be
speaking about is tawny effect and I
love Pony so much and I had the pleasure
of meeting her in LA and if you don't
know Tonia's she's like my favorite
Korean makeup artist she's amazing and
she's just as beautiful and sweet and
realized and I just kind of wanted to
try out some more of her products you
guys know I love her contour palette so
I grabbed a couple more items to try out
the first is my newest obsession which
is the blurring powder so what I'll do
is after I apply my foundation and
concealer I'll grab my Beauty Blender
and I'll pop it into this mesh fit and
then I'll just kind of put it on my
under eyes my small lines my nose and my
forehead and I don't bake because I'm
not like an oily person so I'll just
like leave it on for maybe five seconds
and then I'll grab a big fluffy brush
and just kind of brush all the excess
off it does a really great job keeping
me matte and I find that this powder
kind of like blurs over pores because
it's such a fine powder and yeah
definitely expect to see it in a future
makeup tutorial the next Pony effect
item that I have
is the intense eye tint this is in the
shade lucky charm and it's in this
gorgeous bronze II metallic shade and
this is a liquid eyeshadow so the first
time I used it was a little challenging
because it's like my first time ever
using a project like this but I think
I've got the hang of it so what you'll
do is grab the doe foot applicator and
you only have one coat to do this what
I've found that is you can't really
layer with this item even if you let the
first layer dry when you go in with the
second coat it just kind of like gets
wet again and it can become a little
patchy so you get it right the first
coat it leaves like a really pigmented
metallic color and then I'll go in with
like the brush to kind of make it
seamless at the end now I'm going to
talk about a highlighter this is her
strobing Luminizer and I'm obsessed with
the packaging I love the rose gold comes
in a beautiful pump like this and all
you need is half a full line is a little
too much but I'll warm it up in the back
of my hand
and then with a damp Beauty Blender I'll
pop it on to the cheekbones nose bridge
Cupid's bow chin all the normal areas
and it does like a beautiful job just
luminizing the face this is definitely
more of a natural finish it's not going
to make you look like you're freaking
glowing to the gods but this is
something that's more everyday casual
and it does a great job my next item is
this brow product by Clio and this has
two functions the first end is the
tattoo pen and I find this part really
difficult to use especially for me
because I'm so used to using like a brow
pencil that I don't really know what to
do with this marker
I tried drawing it on my brows but I
feel like I don't have much brow so when
I draw it and it just looks it just is
odd so I'll just use my normal brow
pencil and then I'll use the brow
mascara which is on the other end now
this is what I love this is a very
pigmented brow gel and it just leaves my
brows looking like nice and soft and
brown and I feel like it really
complements my hair color because as you
know my eyebrows are black so this gives
it more of like a nice brown natural
look so now I want to talk about some
items from a tude house first is the
play
one sticks the first bit is the contour
side and I just like to use this to
contour my nose I've tried doing it on
the cheekbones but I don't know I just I
just prefer the way powder looks I still
haven't mastered this but for the nose
it's amazing I'll use this to make my
nose look a little bit more defined and
just use my fingers to blend everything
in and the other side is the highlighter
and if I'm to be honest I don't use this
side too much because I'll just use any
of my other highlighters but in the clip
what kind of show you what it looks like
and it does a really great job my last
item is a mascara this is a two houses
curl fix mascara and this is one of the
most water-resistant mascaras that I've
ever come across
like literally tears everything it just
doesn't come off and if you have really
short tiny lashes like me this is also
great because the formula is very very
dry so once you curl your lashes and
then you apply this on there just up and
perky which is very very nice
the downside is it's a bitch to remove
it it takes like a good doused pad with
like heavy eye makeup remover and you
just have to leave it on your eyes for
like a good minute but other than that
this products great alright everyone
