long-awaited
Korean beauty haul review it took me a
while to edit this because I wanted to
film my first impressions of the
products and so that took me a while
because I didn't want to try out all
these products on the same day because I
felt like that would totally overload my
skin and I'd probably break out so I
spaced it out in a span of maybe two
weeks so I feel like I have a good
impression of all these products so
let's get started the first set of
cosmetics I'm gonna be talking about is
a brand called too-cool-for-school and I
feel like that name really fits them
because their products are just too cool
so the first product I'll be talking
about is their CC cream this is called
cinema city and it's part of their Dino
Platts collection and packaging is
really neat because there is a option to
use a blush on top this is just a coral
creamy blush but to be honest I'm not
gonna be using much of it because I
don't really like cream blushes I prefer
in powder form so this guy is probably
not going to get that much love and when
you twist off the cap that's where the
CC cream comes out and if CC cream is a
complexion correcting cream and it's
just kind of like an all-in-one makeup
and skincare thing there is SPF in here
there's a moisturize in here and it's
supposed to have anti-aging properties
so just goodness on your face which is
always plus it only comes in one shade
which is definitely limiting if I got
any tanner I wouldn't be able to use
this because um it's just a little bit
too pale next up I have a lip crayon
this is called lost identity and don't
let the green in the tube fool you
because it actually turns into a
beautiful soft glossy pink once it hits
your body temperature like the heat
makes it into pink so science very cool
and because it's a lip tint it's not
cakey at all it has long lasting power
and it's just a really easy low
maintenance lip product and I like it
next up I have their egg cream mask and
I'm not gonna lie this one is pretty
slimy and very messy but it's all good
because your skin feels amazing
afterwards this sheet mask adds moisture
and brightens up your skin with egg yolk
extract and before you apply it make
sure you take off this plus
goz sing-off it's pretty spikey
Stephanie told me that when she opened
this she thought that the gauze was
meant to be on her face too so she ended
up scratching a little part of her face
so yeah don't hurt yourself take off
that plastic guy it's all good so this
is also part of that egg collection this
is the egg mousse pack and this was
definitely the most unique mask I've
ever put on it's really interesting
because it comes out in a mousse formula
it's very strange
so you apply maybe like a ping-pong
sized amount and then you just massage
it into your face and the texture feels
exactly like mousse literally it feels
like you're about to shave your face or
something you let the mousse absorb into
your skin for maybe fifteen to twenty
minutes and then the product should draw
out sebum and impurities and by the end
of the session the mousse will have
evaporated and so you just have this
really translucent glassy sticky type
mask left and then you just rinse that
off and after I felt like my skin was a
lot tighter and just brighter just felt
good you know you know that feeling if
you do a mask your skin just feels just
very rejuvenated my next product is a
contouring powder and this is used to
chisel and sculpt the face make the
cheekbones really pop out so when you
open it there is a little trio there is
a light medium dark but I like to just
use all three I switched my contouring
brush and I just apply it to the hollows
of my cheeks and the formula is quite
light there's a lot less room for
mistakes that way I mean I really don't
like highly pigmented contouring powders
because I feel like I just look like
I've dirt smeared on my face because I
don't know how to ration it so I like
guys like this where you can just slowly
build up my last too-cool-for-school
item is there a perfect day makeup fixer
and this is just a setting spray you're
supposed to apply it after you finished
your makeup look and it's supposed to
lock it in place and this is amazing for
humid weather and also the packaging is
so cute there's a bunch of little dots
on the front and I guess that's supposed
to symbolize the mist that comes out of
it and it's a very fine mist so it's
very cooling and I don't know I just
feel really good when I use it it feels
very luxurious next items are from a
brand called vanilla Co and this is
actually the first time I've ever heard
of the
brand but I've heard a lot of good
things about them when I was in Korea so
I decided to give him a try they're
known for their skin care products and
their CC cream but the funny thing is I
didn't get their CC cream because I
thought that the one that I got at too
cool for school would be enough so I end
up just getting some other bits sheet
masks are a huge deal in Korea so I
decided to get some interesting ones
this is their lace hydrogel mask sheet
and it's kind of like a gel consistency
with a lace design over it I love the
mask on for around 20 minutes but it
says on the back you can leave it on for
40 minutes
but um yeah I guess that really depends
on you and how much time you have but I
found that the lifting one I felt like a
tingling sensation all around my face
and it's not like a scary tingling it's
not painful at all it's just a sensation
so I thought I would put that out there
after I took it off my face felt firm
and just good I want to get the lifting
one again because I only have the
moisturizing one left now I got some eye
shadow from them this is their quality
air and the packaging is very
questionable like what is going on here
this is like snowflakes on there I don't
know maybe it's part of their winter
collection but either way the colors on
this are so beautiful there are four
shades one is a beautiful rose gold
which I apply to the innards of my eyes
this gold and this bronze are really
good for just the lid and this darker
iridescent one is just used for more
depth um you probably just get away but
just bringing this palette if you're
traveling and you want to be a lot more
minimal with your makeup lastly I got
their famous cleansing balm this is
called clean at zero and cleansing palms
are a new thing for me and I think I
really love it because I like I think I
prefer using a cleansing balm as opposed
to using just a makeup wipe because I
feel like a lot gets left behind with a
makeup wipe this guy really melts off
all your makeup so when you open it it
comes with a little spoon II guy so you
can stay hygienic and just grab what you
need and then on just like your full
cakey makeup face you just apply it and
the balm dissolves into this kind of
silky oily texture and then it just
melts away all your makeup even my
waterproof mascara which I thought was
very impressive
even though this bomb does a really
great job removing all the makeup I just
love to double cleanse so I go in a
second time with just my normal SK to
daily cleanser and then I'll wipe off my
face like that and I feel like my face
is super clean and this is just a really
great addition to my skincare routine
the last batch of items comes from a
brand called skin food and I've actually
used their products before I use their
makeup wipes and I used to scrub before
and I really enjoyed it so I decided to
go in the store and check myself out and
I really like how all their products
circle back into food that has good
properties for the skin I've been in
need of an exfoliator for quite some
time I think before I bought this the
last time I exfoliated my face was maybe
six months ago so the beginning of the
year so I definitely needed this this is
their black sugar mask wash off and this
is probably one of their best sellers
and this is a scrub and mask fusion it
comes in this really interesting Brown
looking paste and I apply it onto damp
skin and I just kind of massage it
gently avoiding my eyes because that
would be very painful if it got into the
eyes and I leave it on for ten minutes
and I felt like my face felt a lot
softer more polished especially because
I basically scraped off all the dead
skin on my face and it just felt a lot
softer I'm definitely going to be using
this at least once a week next up I got
a sunscreen this is the tomato cool and
dry a Sun spray with SPF 50 and I
absolutely love this sunscreen for many
reasons first off it comes in a can I
like when it comes in a can because just
easy to get all the nooks and crannies
of your body
solo secondly when you apply this there
is like an immediate cooling sensation
on your body which I thought was so
tight so when you're in a really hot
humid environment spraying this is going
to be such a relief so that's going to
be really good if I'm at a very hot
Music Festival next time and lastly it
dries matte so most of the times when
you're adding sunscreen I feel like kind
of like a greased up wrestler or a pig
or something no not with this guy this
dries matte dries very fast and it has
great sun protection what more can you
want and no it doesn't smell like tomato
it just kind of has like a clean
hygienic scent smells like my mom
alright folks so that is a wrap
I hope you found this video very
informative I'm using these products
over the next couple of months to see
which ones are my favorite and which
ones are here to stay and yeah I feel
like there are so many other Korean
products that I didn't get to explore
like brands like Innisfree or the face
shop so I'm kind of disappointed in that
but um there's always my next Korea trip
so yeah I thought three brands in this
video would be enough if you liked the
video hit the like button and thank you
so much for watching I'll see you guys
the next one ah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
