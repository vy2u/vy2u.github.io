sick and so I thought I'd wear a lot of
makeup on my face to kind of counteract
how I'm feeling internally anyway I
thought I would film my Korea beauty
haul video that I promised last week so
here it is all the beauty products I got
were from at dude house fellas in the
number one place I wanted to go because
I've heard awesome reviews about it and
because I think the packaging is really
cute I've heard a lot of things about BB
cream in the States but unfortunately
all the best ones were out in Asia I've
got this BB cream this is the precious
mineral BB cream bright fit and this was
a highly recommended by my cousin I
would say this BB cream has decent
coverage I only use a pump which I think
I could use a lot less but just one pump
seemed so satisfying well my cousin
recommended that I do in order to get
that really glowy and dewy look is to
add a volume err and for this I only use
about a third of the size that I use for
my BB cream and then I mix it all
together and then I put it on my face
and I just powder my t-zone and just
leave my cheeks and everything else kind
of fresh and glowy I wouldn't say this
product is a must but it's definitely
nice to have next step I've got some
fake bottom lashes I thought I would get
some false ones because I'm always
coating the living crap out of mine so I
thought it'd be easier to skip the
middleman and just get a pair of fake
ones I get to put them on my face
because I'm kind of intimidated by this
but when I do I will let you know how it
works out now we're going to move on to
lip colors I have this beige one this
one is called a tone on beige II and I
really like this because it is very very
natural it's got a slight pink tinge to
it and it's really a versatile color I
can see myself wearing it with just a
whatever eyeshadow look to a full blown
intense smoky eye the formula isn't bad
I wouldn't say it lasts all day
it maybe last for maybe three hours but
it fades really gracefully which I can
appreciate because I don't care if a lip
color kind of fades throughout the day
as long as it goes off really naturally
as opposed to have
weird splotches this color isn't going
to do that next up we've got a milkshake
orange color it's kind of like a creamy
orange and this one I would strongly
strongly recommend having a orange lip
liner with because this one is totally
unforgiving if your lips have the
slightest amount of skin on it this will
just highlight it and reinforce all the
flex on your lips so I would say
definitely exfoliate your lips before
when your lips are in check this color
is phenomenal and this color is called
Shannon oranjee which means like excited
orange next color I really didn't have
to get this one is called shingo tone or
ng and this one is pretty freakin
similar from the other one except for
this one is less milky and just more
true Orange
I would say it's a little more milky
than more Onge for Mac so that's why I'm
glad that I have the option to decide
what kind of orange lip I want I would
say that this color is also pretty
unforgiving if your lips are a mess so
make sure you exfoliate before you put
this on the last lip color is this
pretty hot pink fuchsia and this one is
called daddy con red though I think ja d
cun bed okay I don't know what that
means this is probably one of my
favorite shades just slap on a bad day
because lipstick can completely
transform a dull face into something
that's a little bit more acceptable
unlike the two orange colors this gives
you a little bit more wiggle room on the
laziness so you don't have to exfoliate
everything perfectly because this one
will just kind of glaze on over
everything and it's a really nice color
so these are the earrings that I bought
in in Tulum and I bought it all from the
same woman who had this amazing wagon of
beautiful jewelry I really wish I had
more cash because I would have totally
spurred a lot more so this is the first
pair it's kind of like this strange
Lantern contraption with a bunch of
floral tassels hanging about I just
thought they were really pretty and
feminine and like a silhouette that I've
never seen a from 21 or hmm the next
pair are these interesting looking
objects that look like a spinning top
they are dangly okay so that's what it
looks like but I think these are my
favorite pair of earrings that I got in
Korea
cuz they're really simple and they just
have a huge statement with it and plus
I've never seen anything like this in
America lastly I got these earrings with
silver and turquoise and they have some
feather tassels hanging on him I think
this is just going to be a good pair of
earrings to pair with all-black outfits
to add a hint of color so those were all
my beauty products and some of the
accessories that I got in Korea I would
film more but I am not feeling like the
business right now so I think I'm just
going to show the rest of my accessories
and whatnot in just a regular styling
video and then I'll just be like oh I
got that from Korea so I get to kind of
chill up for today I'm currently working
on editing the Korea vlog yes I did film
one so that's the good news but the bad
news is that it's probably going to be
out at the end of this month or early
November it's just 9 days of solid
footage if you have an Instagram or you
have a Twitter account my username is
I'm running follow me if you'd like and
I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
