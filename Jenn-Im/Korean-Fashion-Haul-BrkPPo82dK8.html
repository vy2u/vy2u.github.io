showing you all the clothing that I got
from my Korea trip which was around 2
months ago I know it took me a while but
to be fair I did move right when I got
back from Korea so for a while I
couldn't find all the career pieces but
luckily I have rallied them all together
to show you them all in this collective
Korea fashion haul so let's get started
I'm going to start off with tops so here
I have this big black oversized shirt
that says the golden rail on it and at
first class I thought it was a fan tee
but it turns out it's just some sort of
pale house in New York but I still love
it anyway what really got my attention
was these little silver studs all around
it it does make my skin quite cold when
it touches but it's all good it's
definitely a nice summer shirt to just
kind of lounge around in if you love
stirred away then you're gonna love my
next top it is another oversized tee but
this one is ribbed and it has no face on
it I got this shirt in HMDA just walking
around and it was styled with a pair of
these really cute overalls and
unfortunately the overalls were separate
but I knew that I can sell them in my
own closet because I have a ton of other
overalls and it's just really cute how
no face just kind of peeks out that's
one of my favorite ways to style this
shirt if you follow me on instagram then
this shirt is probably familiar this is
my beautiful pale peach number and what
I love about this shirt is definitely
this black piping it kind of looks like
a pajama top but it still looks really
elegant so it's the perfect fusion of
refined and relaxed next up I've got a
cobalt blue tank that says today I do
nothing this saying just makes me smile
because although I'm very busy I'm quite
a lazy person as well so this message
just really speaks to me I just thought
that this would be a fun tank to wear on
a lazy Sunday morning or at the gym
because it would make it quite ironic my
next shirt is from a land and I only got
one thing which is this shirt that is
not the best fitting on me but
I just love the message so much in the
back it says we do not see things as
they are we see things as we are and I
thought this was a really great reminder
that perspective is everything and
things can be seen very differently
according to who is looking at it and
where their mindset is for example an
optimistic person and a pessimistic
person can be faced with the same issue
but they can see it in a very different
light and trust me you probably want to
be in the optimistic side because
pessimism can be so draining I only got
one outerwear piece which is
understandable because it is summer but
I got this Navy linen blazer I thought
that this would be perfect on summer
nights where I wanted to look a little
bit more professional but still stay
cool this is not lined so it's very very
breathable trying to look at the
positive side for this usually I hate
when things are not lined especially
when I paid 66:1 for it so I did not get
a deal on this at all now we're going to
move on to the pant department here I
have these denim wide leg trousers these
are very lightweight it's like a
chambray material great for the warm
season and I got these in youngnam I
believe and these were literally hung up
in every stall there and by the end of
it I just kind of caved because they're
actually really cute I really love the
shoe lace detail here it cinches the
waist and gives it a nice paper bag
effect and yeah I can't wait to stylee's
in a lookbook so my last pair of pants
are these black white black flare
trousers I loved these because they're
actually a really great length on me in
Korea I am considered normal size which
makes me super happy usually in the
States it's a nightmare trying to find
pants that are a good length on me
because I'm only 5 foot 1 and these
pants are the bomb I love them so much
it really should have gotten more pants
while I was out there now for the final
category we're gonna go over all the
head accessories I got because you know
your girl had a stock of so this is the
first hat this is a cap that says 97 on
it it's got a bunch of sailboats all in
primary colors but yeah this hat just
screams summer so I
get it the next hat I got is this pink
cap that says Cherry Bomb on it along
with this character I have no idea where
this character comes from it might be
from Kakao like that little mushroom guy
with the butt but I don't know if you
guys know where this graphic is from
please enlighten me I would love to know
my last cap is this seafoam one that
says supreme on it and obviously this is
a knockoff but I feel like everything
cute from supreme is always sold out
anyways if this is like my only way to
get my hands on something that is that
says supreme on it but I had to get it
because I love the color scheme I love
seafoam and pink together that's one of
my favorite color combinations so uh I
had a copy the last and final piece from
my Korea haul is this headband take a
good look at it it is a lot of look it's
quite gaudy
but there is a good story behind this so
me and my family were walking around
inside alone and there's this trend
where girls get dressed up in their hon
box and they take photos all around int
along and humbug is traditional garb and
I guess these headbands are what they
wear on top with the with the hon bulk
and every time I saw one I feel like huh
my dad started to notice and he went to
a stall and he got me this headband and
it just made me feel like a little girl
again I'm shopping with your parents and
I'm surprising you with something or
them giving you allowance to get
something that you really want I don't
know we've kind of like such a long way
because all the times I feel like I'm
aborted with feeling like an adult and
adulting is so tough and this headband
just makes me feel like a I don't know
makes me feel like a kid again and it's
just easy happy alright guys so that's a
wrap on my crea haul

items because I got them in store as a
boost online but you know I would link
them if I did get them online also news
