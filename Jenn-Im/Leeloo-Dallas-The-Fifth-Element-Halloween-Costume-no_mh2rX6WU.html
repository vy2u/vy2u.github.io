Fifth Element was one of the most badass
chicks on the planet so watch me
transform into her I'm starting off with
tartes Amazonian clay foundation and
just kind of blending that up all over
my face and then I'm using Bobby Brown's
creamy concealer and then popping that
right underneath my under eye circles to
hold everything in place I'm using
Rimmel stay matte powder and just using
that on my cheeks and on my t-zone to
make sure it is matte now to work on
those eyebrows I'm using honest agios
brow is in medium ash I just dip my
brows the way I normally do them because
that's the only way I know how to do my
brows just pretty sad and this is the
way they look after they're finished I'm
going to take Anastasia's brow gel and
caramel to lighten up the color and make
sure that all the hair is stay in place
we're ready to move on to eyeshadows so
I'm going to use this primer from lorac
and then I'm going to put on this spring
plum color by Shiseido and I'm just
going to pop that on to both of my lids
after that is finished I'm going to get
this red eyeshadow and I have no idea
where this palette came from I'm pretty
sure was a hand-me-down and I'm going to
mix this red eyeshadow with this color
garnett from the lorac Pro palette that
Claire gave me a long time ago no I'm
having but like a few months ago so
thanks Claire I'm going to mix these two
colors and I'm just gonna blend blend
blend but don't be too crazy up blending
because we're going to get this taupe
color and we're going to help blur out
the edges even better
once you've done your best you're going
to take espresso which is a dark brown
color and then using a smudge brush I'm
just going to add it onto the rims of my
eyelids and that's just going to
intensify the look after we're going to
take this light bronze color which is
more of a champagne a goldish color I'm
going to put that into the inner tear
ducts of my eyeballs or eyelids and then
I'm going to take this gold color and
you pop that into the inner thirds of my
eyelids and this is just going to create
more dimension and make the eyeshadow
look a lot more blended and nice and
whatever that's remaining just put that
on to your brow bone so after taking a
second look I thought I would just
intensify the look even more so we're
going to go back to the dark brown and
I'm just going to really really pack
that on to the outer thirds of my
eyelids next up I'm using a eyeliner
from Tarte and I'm just going to use
that on the bottom lids and this is just
going to smoke it all out then using a
smudge brush get some of that garnett
color that we used previously and use it
to just kind of blur out the black and
create a winged out cat eye effect next
getting a fluffy brush just kind of
blend it in altogether try your best on
blending but if it's not perfect it's
okay no one's gonna notice then we're
gonna get makeup Forever's liquid
eyeliner and just create a really small
cat eye next up we're going to color our
lashes and we're going to apply mascara
I'm using benefits they're a real
mascara and I'm not committed to this
one whatsoever it's just persuading for
the tube to run out but I'm sure if you
have nice lashes unlike me this mascara
would be pretty awesome on you but for
my thin short lashes it's not a miracle
worker so anyway we're going to apply it
to the top and bottom very lightly
because we're going to have fake
eyelashes today whew it's not very often
that our falsies because there's such a
pain to put on and I don't know I don't
want to look too done up every single
day so falsies are more reserved on you
know special occasions and Halloween is
a damn good excuse to wear them and now
I have one
lash on and I'm going to work on the
next so the eyes are finished and now
I'm going to use a bronzer this one's
from NYC and I'm just going to apply
that to my cheekbones a little bit on my
forehead because that's what you do
tutorials taught me to do so then I'm
going to use my favorite blush which is
coralista I'm going to apply that on to
the apples of my cheeks and a little bit
on my nose because I don't know why I
just like the way it looks then I'm
using a cream highlighter this one's
Watts up by a benefit and I'm going to
apply it on the highest part of my
cheekbones and right down the center of
my nose to give the illusion that it's
taller and then I'm going to blend that
in with my fingers now it is time for
lipstick and using a beige color from
exude house and I'm going to finish it
off with a lip gloss from Tarte I don't
know the name because there is no name
on the bottle so I don't know what shade
it is now the best part it's the wick
time I'm going to put my hair in a
ponytail and then I'm going to flip it
over and I'm going to squeeze into this
flush wig cap and I'm just going to tuck
in all my baby hairs until they're out
of sight out of mind and now I'm going
to throw on this wig I ordered this on
eBay and in the description it said it
was red orange but it came in as this
color whatever it's fine and I think it
works with my costume still it's not
perfect but I think people get the
picture
I fell in love with the Fifth Element
this year it was my first time watching
it and I knew that I wanted to be her
because she is one badass chick
