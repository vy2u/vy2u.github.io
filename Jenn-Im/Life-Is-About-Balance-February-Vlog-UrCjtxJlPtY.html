- Hello everybody, good morning.
Welcome to the second
half of the February vlog.
So here's the deal.
I have been vlogging pretty consistently,
but I haven't done an
intro for any of the clips.
So I'm just gonna try something new
and just kinda fill you in
on what happened already.
Let's start off with
the NBA All Stars game.
I got invited to go by Discover LA.
And so they gave me two tickets.
And so of course, I had
to bring my brother.
He loves basketball.
Literally it was so awesome to get see him
freak out about all the players.
Just been doing my normal
routine of exercising.
I did a private session
with Ellen and Fran.
And that was really fun.
Normally I work from home.
But I tried to go to a cafe,
and so I did some work there with Amy.
I grabbed lunch with my friend Bambi.
And it was really nice
getting to see her in the day.
The only times I've seen
her were at nights out,
so it was really refreshing
getting to see a friend
during the daytime.
And then after that, we went to LACMA,
because it was just a couple blocks away.
And it was just really refreshing
getting to go to LACMA.
It's been, I wanna say, like
two years, two or three years,
since I've been there.
And so I haven't seen a
lot of the stuff there.
I went to Santa Monica
with Ben on a random day.
We decided to take
Cheeky out to the beach,
and it was so refreshing
getting to see her
just run her heart out in the sand.
So I guess that leads me up to today.
Right now I'm getting ready
to go to lunch with Sophia.
We are going to Botanica.
I've only been there once
and I remember really enjoying it.
They have a really good brunch/lunch menu.
So I'm stoked to go.
Also I have an announcement
for everyone living in LA,
on March 10th, I will
be attending A Rare Day,
I will be doing a talk on
10 top tips on making your
channel the greatest it can be,
and I will be doing a
little meetup afterwards,
and I'll also be selling stuff from Eggie,
so you get to see the clothes, touch 'em,
and you get to hang out with me.
I will leave the info
in the description box,
so please go check it out.
I can't wait to see you guys there.
It's gonna be a pretty intimate thing,
so grab your tickets while you still can.
Jackie Aina will be there,
Stephanie will be there,
Kandee Johnson, Aja
Dang, Ellen, Fran, Pau,
are gonna be selling their closets.
It's gonna be just a really
great day empowering women.
And hopefully I will get to
meet a lot of you guys there.
So please come.
(mellow music)
This is some serious moody lighting.
But I'm not mad at it.
I am at Nickelodeon studios.
I just read for a potential
cartoon that I might be in.
But we'll see.
My expectations are pretty low.
But I'm just so glad I got to
go inside the whole studio.
It's so freaking sick.
I grew up watching Nickelodeon
and all the cartoons,
Rugrats, Hey Arnold, Dog,
Ren &amp;amp; Stimpy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters,
okay I'm just literally listing off
all the cartoons I watched.
It's so cool.
So, yeah.
I tried out for a part,
we'll see if I get it.
If I don't, not the end of the world.
I like how I didn't have
to get all gussied up.
I did very minimal eye
makeup and gloss balm
all over the lips.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Champagne's coming.
- I need coffee, right.
- Right now we are at
Emeline's bridal shower,
We're at Daily Dose Cafe,
about to have some food.
(heavy beat music)
Emeline!
- Love you guys so much.
Let's have a great day, today.
- Cheers, yay!
- Cheers!
(cheering)
- So, I won.
- [Camera Operator] What'd you win, Jenn?
- I don't know.
- [Camera Operator] Okay.
(gasp)
- Wow!
- Whoa!
Oh my gosh!
- Oh my God I love this.
- [Camera Operator] So beautiful.
- Oh!
Could be like a earring.
(laughing)
- [Camera Operator] That'd be so intense.
(gasping)
(screaming)
- Aw!
- Aw!
So beautiful.
- Thank you guys so much.
- [Jenn] Aw.
- Good morning everybody.
Here I am on set.
I am with the lovely Amy.
She is assisting me today.
She loves to steam.
- I do.
(laughing)
And I love to squat.
So we got both right now.
- We're shooting Eggie drop number four.
I have all my accessories laid out here.
Yeah, it's gonna be a good day.
(mellow r&amp;amp;b music)
(feet stepping)
(clanging)
(pouring)
Morning.
(sipping)
Ahh.
Mm.
So Amy has been giving me
these homemade Raw bars.
I believe this is Aimee Song's recipe.
And I have been just eating all the ones
that she makes me, so thank you.
They're so delicious.
I woke up at 6:50 a.m. in the morning.
I have just been feeling more
inspired to wake up early
since I'm reading this book
called The Power of Habit.
I've learned that throughout the day,
40% of your brain is just
doing things out of habit.
Like your brain just automatically knows.
So if you create good habits,
then you can really lead
a super productive life.
And that is what I'm trying to do.
So one thing I wanna
do is waking up early.
Because when I wake up early,
it makes me want to work out.
And when I work out, it
makes me wanna eat better.
And when I eat better, I feel better.
I've just been running around
for all this Eggie stuff,
and maintaining the channel,
and still trying to balance everything.
But I was feeling pretty
low the past couple of days.
And I felt like very just
sensitive to everything.
And lo and behold, I got my period today.
So that explains a lot.
I mean I don't want to excuse
my mood swings for PMS,
but Jesus Christ, it's like clockwork.
A couple days before my period
I'm just like, I don't know,
I'm just very on edge.
I don't know if anyone is like that.
But if you are, please,
please let me know.
Tell me I'm not alone.
- We've got a coffee machine from Tart?
- [Jenn] Yeah, Tart.
- They usually send lipsticks,
and things like that.
But this time it's a coffee machine.
- [Jenn] I know.
- I hope the coffee's
as good as your brows.
- [Jenn] Thank you so much, Tart.
This is a first for us.
We've never gotten a coffee machine.
- Something that we really use.
- [Jenn] Mm hmm.
He loves coffee.
- I do love coffee.
So we're very happy about this.
- [Jenn] It will fit perfectly there.
- Everything's silver, though.
- [Jenn] I know.
Do you fancy an espresso?
- I think I do fancy an espresso.
Yeah, I just went to the post, the PO box,
to get Jenn's packages.
There's always plenty.
As much as it's very that
we get sent a lot of stuff,
some of it is,
like getting packages with
little TVs inside.
- TV screens, yeah.
You get four eyelashes
and television inside.
No one's gonna use it.
Your not gonna sit up and watch
the same advert over and
over for like a year.
Like, you throw it away.
This day and age we shouldn't
be doing things like that.
- Yeah, at this point.
- But other than, you know,
we got a coffee machine.
- But I mean this is cool, though.
I mean, getting something
that actually functions
that we can use over and over is great.
Oh my, they gave us so much!
Wow!
- You wanna use filtered water
so the coffee tastes better.
Here we go.
(machine humming loudly)
- [Jenn] Wow.
- I think this is the first time I've ever
opened one of your
packages and got to use it.
- [Jenn] Yeah.
(laughing)
- Now you do the first taste test, babe.
Pop it in there.
(ice clinking)
- Ooh, that's nice.
Ooh.
- Mm, I like it.
- I like it too.
- Maybe it's like the
decaf one or something,
we're like--
- Oh, can you imagine.
- It's not doing anything.
- Yeah, it's actually not
doing anything at all.
- [Television] I was the
first audience for this film,
and it really was about
getting to go home,
at the end of the day.
You know, some of this time
I was working on Campio.
(traffic passing)
- We are on a little
outing with Ben and Sam.
Hi!
- Hello.
- AKA Joffrey.
- Hey, Joffrey.
We're heading to the
little farmer's market
in our neighborhood.
We're gonna get some
food, and lots of samples.
(groovy hip hop music)
Oh my gosh, so here are
the Silver Lake Footsteps.
They're right over here.
Wow.
I think it goes up to
four stories of stairs.
So this is awesome.
- [Ben] That's my girls.
Shipoo.
- We're having a little
bit of a hummus feast.
Wow, we've got some of
the best flavors here.
This is my personal favorite.
This is the Garlic Jalapeno.
- [Ben] Garlic Spread/Basil.
- [Jenn] This one's really good too.
- [Ben] Basil.
- [Jenn] Three Layer
Dip, which is phenomenal.
This one tastes like a pizza.
Sun dried tomato Garlic.
And then we also got a vegan cheese
which is called Herbie Vore.
- [Ben] I think by the end
of this tasting session,
we've all got decide
to from top to bottom.
- Oh, ranking system?
- [Ben] Yeah, so think
about that as you eat.
This one's very hard to top.
- Mm.
(crunching)
Wow.
(mellow lounge music)
(restaurant patrons mumbling)
I'm at Boiling Point
with my big bro James.
Perfect food for a rainy day.
(mumbling)
It's so good.
All right, so here we are
at the Puente Hills Mall
this is my childhood
or our childhood mall.
We spent a lot of hours
here when we were teenagers.
Especially me. I've had
all my first jobs here.
Like I worked at the ice cream store,
I worked at the sushi sports bar,
I worked at two smoothie shops here,
and I worked at the Forever 21.
- Yeah, you made your rounds.
- And at Johnny Rockets.
I worked at every store
in this freaking mall.
- You're like on the hall of fame.
- I wish there was.
(laughing)
Okay, here we go.
Wow.
- [James] The smell.
(sighing)
- Oh my God, it smells so good.
(sniffing)
It smells like pretzels and...
(sniffing)
- It still smells the same, though, right?
- Yeah, it does.
That same mall smell.
(mumbling)
Oh my God!
Sarcasm on.
Sarcasm
off.
Aw, Hot topic has become a store
just filled with these Pop figurines now.
A complete different store
than when I was here.
Now we're at another store and look.
These Pop figurines, we can't escape them.
But this store actually
has a lot of selection.
And we also got these.
(laughing)
Of all the games, James
chooses to play this one.
Every cup is a winner.
- It's like the most soulless game.
(laughing)
Oh, damn it!
Oh!
That's so loud.
(laughing)
- [Jenn] That's so loud.
(mellow r&amp;amp;b music)
(guns shooting)
- What are we gonna do?
What is that?
(screaming)
(laughing)
(clicking)
I am back home now.
It is 11:20, I got back
maybe 30 minutes ago.
And so I was just winding down,
getting ready for bed, but
tonight was so much fun.
I can't believe we just
walked around the mall.
But we literally went through
every store and every corner,
and it's crazy how much
that mall has changed.
I wanna wake up bright and early
because tomorrow I've
got Barry's boot camp.
Yeah, I'm going with Amy, so
that should be a lot of fun.
I don't know, these days
I get really excited
to go to workout classes.
Cheeky, say goodnight.
(mellow lounge music)
Signing in to say goodbye.
I just entered all the
clips into my laptop
and I'm gonna spend the
entire day editing this
for Sunday.
I wanna thank you guys
so much for watching.
Cheeky, do you wanna say something?
Okay, good chat, good chat.
All right, if you guys
would like to tell me
what you guys are up to in
the comments down below,
please let me know how are
you spending your day today?
I'll be in bed editing.
It is raining super hard,
so it's just a good time to
take advantage of this weather
and be a homebody.
So, yeah, let me know
what you guys are up to.
I will be answering as many comments
as I possibly can when
I upload this video.
So thanks so much for watching,
and I'll see you guys next one.
Bye!
Muah.
