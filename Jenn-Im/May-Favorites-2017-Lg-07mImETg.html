again the time has come to send another
month off into the past this time it's
the month of May and as usual I've
gathered my favorite products and items
to share with you and also if you're not
subscribed to my channel already please
do the button is somewhere down below
and with that said let's get this video
started
I need a feature my vans platform
sneakers I feel like everyone and their
moms are going through a vans phase but
honestly I'm not mad at that these shoes
are just undeniably comfortable they're
effortlessly cool and these have become
my everyday shoe I personally love these
shoes because they still have a little
platform it gives me an extra inch and
me being a shortie I can use all the
height and get I'm currently in the
process of creating my top favorite
books of all time video and I know
that's highly requested but before I
filmed it I wanted to make sure that I
reread every book on that list
and to save time I'm so happy that I
partnered with audible because instead
of rereading every single book on the
list I can listen to them as audiobooks
and if you don't know what audible is by
now it's a service where you can listen
to just like a massive library of
audiobooks there's radio there's news
like the list goes on
but one audiobooks that I finish is the
Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde
it's about an attractive young man named
Dorian Gray and he's his muse of this
artist and he's getting his portrait
done artist inking and he ends up
befriending this person named Lord Henry
Wotton
and Lord Henry he has a very interesting
philosophy in life he just believes that
people should just enjoy the pleasures
in life Dorian ends up getting very
inspired by this lifestyle and he ends
up kind of picking it up and so Dorian
sells his soul and he gets to look young
and just have like eternal youth and he
ends up just living it up he does like
the craziest stuff and he just has this
nasty shallow materialistic life and
every time he does something bad his
portrait
kind of shows like a fog it gets more
or disgusting and it deteriorates and it
just kind of reflects how he actually is
as a person I'm reading this book for
the first time when I was 19 and it just
really radically changed my life
honestly it was a little tempting just
to kind of like live it up and kind of
see the beauty and just being
spontaneous and doing what you want and
doing things for you but obviously that
lifestyle isn't sustainable you can't
just be a selfish prick and if you guys
are interested in reading it audible as
having a free 30-day trial all you're
going to do is go on audible.com slash
clothes check it out honestly audible
has such an amazing library they've got
so many different types of choices
they've got business self-improvement
the classics
I don't know erotica like everything my
next favorite is a pair of sunglasses
these are from perverse and I have just
been obsessed with the way they look
they're nice and oversized so I can drop
them on no makeup days my requirement is
that the sunglasses can cover the
eyebrows so see it's totally fine so
these are great for just running out the
door and there's just like a nice chic
element about it I think it's probably
the cat eye even though most cat eye
frames are pretty difficult to pull off
these are great because they're on the
larger side so they really suit any two
face shapes and lastly when I wear these
sunglasses and I smile my cheeks don't
touch the bottom of the frame and that's
good that's like a requirement for all
my sunglasses to not touch my cheek so
these passed the test so now I'm going
to move on to a skin care item last
month I tried a new eye cream this is
Courreges black pine eye serum and let
me let me just talk about the packaging
first I know that doesn't have to do
with actual formula but let me just let
me just talk about this because this is
so innovative to me so what you do is
you click the back and it distributes
the perfect amount of eye serum onto
each eye and I enjoy the precision
because for a lot of eye creams when
they're in the tub I end up just putting
way too much on each eye so it's nice
that this is already pre portion
controlled for you and now about the
actual formula I really like it because
it's quite thin it's definitely a serum
sort of a cream so I feel like my skin
really drinks it up also on the
direction that's to put it on your
eyelid as well so that's like a first
for me because for most I creams they
say to only put it on like the bottom
area like your under eyes so I like the
fact that it's going on top though
because I'm pretty sure that the top of
the eyelid will start to Sag as well so
I want like to put product on there I
feel like I'm always kind of hopping
around different eye creams but I think
I'm gonna stick with this one for now
because I'm really diggin it
next up I've got a lip color this is
called tryst by Urban Decay and this is
part of their vice liquid lipstick line
and this is actually a very unexpected
find so I filmed a truth or dare
challenge video with my girls lately in
Sofia and one of the dares we did was to
put liquid lipstick on each other using
our mouths and this was just like a
random color that I kind of found in the
drawer and I ended up just loving it
when Sofia applied it to me and it's
just been on my lips ever since then
this is just a really flashy fuchsia
shade that I think is great to rock on
days where my eye makeup is a little bit
more subdued I feel like it just really
enhances the whole makeup look my next
favorite is a beauty tool this is a lash
applicator by velour and I have no idea
where this has been all my life this is
change be falsies game for me prior to
using this I was just like using
tweezers and I thought that was fine and
even if my lashes and my falsies weren't
completely aligned I just dealt with it
with this that is not an issue anymore
you pick up the lashes with precision
with this and you just could align it so
perfectly onto the like to band and once
the falsies and the lashes are together
you just kind of squeeze this tool and
it just melds the lash and the falsies
so perfectly like this is just a must if
you're doing falsies like I don't know
why I didn't use this before but now I
know my last favorite is a TV show and I
want to thank you guys for recommending
it to me
you wrote a bunch of comments in my last
favorites video and I wanted to watched
it without you guys so thank you for
putting it on my radar it's called The
Handmaid's Tale and this is actually a
show based on one of my favorite novels
and I had no
idea they were going to make it into a
TV show and honestly I was a little
skeptical before watching because most
the time like booked to like film / like
TV adaptations they're always like
pretty bad because I feel like nothing
is as thorough as the book not with this
case like I really really like the way
they're going with it it takes place in
the future and it's a dystopia and women
the United States have completely lost
their right they're not even allowed to
read and all these women are divided
into different categories like there are
wives
there are handmaids and they're on but
this story follow the handmade name
Offred and a handmaid is someone who is
a concubine
so man-made have to have sex the
commander every month she's forced to
have sex with him while the wife is
there and it's a very freaky transaction
but this is the best solution they came
up with because the birth rates are so
low like it's a long story line but I
swear it's very interesting and like I
really like the way the show is going
because it's going beyond the book which
I appreciate so yeah it's on every
Wednesday it's on whoo and this is the
first time in a long time I've been very
excited for each new episode so I highly
recommend it and you should watch it
alright that concludes my may favorites
for this month as always please write
your recommendations in the comments
down below I really love it when that
section becomes like an open discussion
for inspiration and ideas and by the
time you are watching this I will be
moving out of my apartment
so this is this may be last time you see
this little setup or you're gonna do the
furniture but it will just be shifted
differently I'm going to really miss
this apartment and hopefully this will
be my last move in a very very very long
time
yeah I'll tell you more about that later
I want to thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you guys in the
next one
ah ma
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
