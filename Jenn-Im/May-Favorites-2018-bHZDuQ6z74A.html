- Hey everyone, it's your girl Jenn,
and welcome back to my channel.
Today I'm talking about all my favorites
because it is the beginning of the month.
May was actually a really great
and productive month for me.
It was the most times I've
uploaded in one month,
so I'm super proud of myself.
I'm gonna try my best to do
that for June, but we'll see.
But regardless, let's chat
about all my favorite things of May.
Let's get started.
First up, I wanna chat
about my Converse shoes.
Now these are beyond
just your classic Chucks.
They have a platform on
them, so they give me
like a good inch and a half,
so I am not complaining about that.
Since I'm short, I love any
height that a shoe can give me.
I really love the way white
sneakers look because they just
really add like a fresh,
crisp, element to any outfit.
And I prefer wearing low-top
sneakers, because when I wear
high-tops it just kinda cuts my leg off
at a weird point so I
like having the low top
because it streamlines the
legs and just makes my legs
look a little bit longer.
Either way these are super comfortable
and they've become my everyday sneaker.
Next up, I wanna chat about
my name plate necklace.
I swear, every time I wear
this I get like three or four
comments asking where it's
from, and it's by a brand
called Bychari and it just is so unique.
I've always loved name plate
necklaces but I've never seen
one like this because all
the letter are spaced out,
and it's so dainty, and
it just adds a beautiful
gold glimmer to the skin.
Since I have warm tones,
I feel like the gold
just really brings that out.
And since it's real gold,
I just shower with it,
I work out with it,
and it never comes off.
Now, I want to chat
about a beauty product;
this is for your hair.
This is by Oribe and it's called
the Mystify Restyling Spray
and this is one of those
all-in-one encompassing products.
Like it has a lot of functionality to it.
So originally I know that it's for
like 'day two' or 'day three' hair
when you want to restyle your hair.
This is like a spray
where you spray downwards
and it just coats your
hair with this lovely mist.
This also acts as a heat protectant,
and that's like the main function for me.
I love putting this on
my hair right before
I'm about to blast it with heat,
whether it's like my
curling iron, my blow dryer.
I just spray it with this,
and it protects my hair.
I'm trying my best to take
better care of my hair
because it's been through a lot and
I want it to be really
long for my wedding,
so products like this are
gonna help me keep it intact.
I have one more fashion
favorite for you, and it is
this denim jacket by the brand Proof.
This was created by our
good friends Robin and Luke,
and so I'm so proud of them
for launching their line.
If you follow me,
Sophia, Weylie, Ben, Wah,
we've all been supporting and
I mean, even if they weren't
our friends, we are just
in love with this jacket
because it is so high quality
and there's so many great
characteristics about it.
So first off, it's just got like a really
chic, timeless cut.
This is a size extra-small,
and it fits perfectly on me.
Secondly, this is water repellent,
stain resistant, and anti-microbial.
So that means if water falls on it,
it's just gonna roll right off.
If someone spills a drink
or gets ketchup on it,
then the stain is not gonna be there.
And the anti-microbial
means that there's no
micro-organisms that are
gonna build and colonize
on this jacket.
So, it's just absolutely incredible.
I know that this jacket is
quite pricey because it is very
high quality but there is a payment plan.
I believe there's a plan that you can do
where you can pay in four segments.
So, I mean it's up to you.
Either way, I am so
proud of Robin and Luke
and you'll definitely
be seeing this jacket
on my social platforms.
For my book favorite I have
'A Thousand Splendid Suns'
and this is recommended
by a handful of you guys,
so thank you so much for your suggestion.
I read the Kite Runner
a couple years back,
and I loved it, and this
book did not disappoint.
So this book takes place in Afghanistan
and it follows the story of two women,
and you'll see later how they meet,
but it shows you a peek of
what Afghanistan was like
before the Soviet War,
and during Taliban Rule.
This really made me
understand what it was like.
And I know that these
characters are fictional,
but it's considered a historical novel.
And it was such a powerful
and resilient story
about two women living
in a nation that does not
put them first by any means.
And it really put things
into perspective for me.
And I know America has its
set of problems, and set of issues,
but we are still so blessed to live
in a nation like this.
We still have freedoms here
that some countries don't have.
And, I don't know, I feel
like if you are interested
in reading a story that is very
emotional, heart wrenching,
but still like resilient and hopeful,
I highly recommend this book.
So, my last favorite is a podcast.
It is called 'The Life
Coach School Podcast',
and this was recommended by Amy.
I swear, all my self-help
recommendations come from her,
so if you just want to get
the recommendations before me
just subscribe to her channel.
Because, I don't know, she's
like the self-help guru.
But regardless, this podcast
has been so amazing to listen to.
So each episode is divided into
something that you wanna improve.
So whether it is conquering
negative emotions,
or time management, productivity, anger.
There's like one on everything.
But one episode that really,
really resonated with me
was called Boundaries,
because I am people pleaser,
and that is not a good thing,
because sometimes I'll say
'yes' to something just because
I know that that person
wants me to say yes.
So as I'm doing that favor, I'm just like
&quot;Urgh! Why did I say yes? Why
did I make myself do this?&quot;
And so the episode about
boundaries was being more honest
about how you feel and
being okay with saying 'no'.
So, the example that she used was
let's say one of your
best friends is like,
&quot;Can you bake 500 cupcakes
for the bake sale?&quot;
And because you're a people
pleaser you just say 'yes'.
And while you're baking you're just like
&quot;What the fuck? Why did I?&quot;
You know, it's not like that friend wanted
you to be angry baking those cupcakes.
Your friend expected you to be honest.
And so a better option on saying
'yes' because you
'feel like that's the right answer'
is to decline, but ask
them for other options
on how you can help.
And chances there,
there's gonna be an option
where you would actually like to do.
And I think that that's important because
when you are people pleasing,
and you say 'yes' to
things you don't want to,
you're actually lying.
People pleasing can be
such a draining thing
because your emotions
and your actions aren't
congruent with one another.
And the more aligned you
are, the happier you are.
And so I feel like, I don't
know, episodes like this
have been really really
nourishing for my soul.
So please go check out the podcast.
There's truly an episode
for any type of topic.
All right guys, those
are all of my favorites
for this month and I
want to thank you guys
so much for watching.
As usual, please write
down all your favorites
in the comments down below.
And before I left I wanted
to do a big, big shout out
to everyone that has been
translating my videos
in different languages.
Truly from the bottom of my heart,
I want to specifically
shout out the ones that are
translating in Korean,
because you guys are able to
make my parents watch my
videos and fully understand
what I'm saying, and that
makes me so, so happy.
It also occurred to me that
I can just like re-watch
my videos with the Korean subtitles on
and learn Korean that way.
So, that is a practice
that I'm gonna try and do.
I mean, maybe it's kind of like
I don't know, is that vain, in any way?
Like watching myself and
learning Korean that way?
But I don't know, it's like,
since you're translating
exactly what I'm saying, I feel like
it would sink into my brain more.
But regardless, I want
to thank you guys so much
for translating and transcribing.
I know it takes so long
to do, it's tedious work,
but please know that it's
being very much appreciated.
Anyway, I want to thank
you guys again for watching
and I'll see guys in the next one.
Bye!
Mwa!
