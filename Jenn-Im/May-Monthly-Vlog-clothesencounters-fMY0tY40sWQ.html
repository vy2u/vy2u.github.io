I've just finishing up work I'm
exporting my Mother's Day gift guide
video that should be out on Sunday I'm
just enjoying some YouTube videos and
eating my favorite chips hot shooter
fries these are the bomb these days I'm
really learning how to portion control
because even last year if I got a bag of
this this would be gone in one session
but this that I've been baking this out
between three days so I'm pretty proud
of myself obviously got to use the
chopsticks to make sure that your
knuckles and your fingers do not get red
it's so embarrassing when I go get my
nails done and they're just stained red
because of the Cheetos it's currently
639 p.m. and hmm Ben's actually helping
Stephanie film a couple things so once
he wraps up I believe we're going to go
to the outlet that we always wanted to
go to is called Citadel and there's like
a big Nike store there so we want to get
some workout gear
yeah we made it to the Citadel outlets
turning into the parking lot there it is
the large Nike outlet so many people
inside already this is exactly what that
needs okay

is one of our favorite vegan restaurants
also another kind of random update but
we're currently in the process of
leaving this apartment so our landlord
just sold our apartment to someone so we
got our 30-day notice to leave but it
might actually be good timing because we
are in the process of getting a place
right now
hopefully the timing works out perfectly
when we move out the new person can move
in here and then we can move to our new
home so crossing my fingers that
everything goes swimmingly I know moving
is pretty stressful but hopefully this
will be our last move in a long time
before we move we'll definitely make
sure to do an apartment tour
kind of like just a tradition I do with
every place that I lived at so that's
something fun to expect
