like a month to get everything done
because I guess they're missing a part
and etc so things got delayed so I feel
so good to be back in my own space the
other rental car I had didn't even have
like a like up like did you have
Bluetooth and since I have an iPhone 7
it doesn't have like an auxiliary cord
so it just has listened to a lot of
radio so now I'm caught up with all the
top picks and stuff which is good but it
feels so good to be back in like horror
the cooler months I was shooting for
Michelle young funny

to spell her it was really fun like you
have a magic ball until we had two
occasion so we got solve it this is the
outfit that we end up loving the most
yet boiler alright so I am on my way
home
and just shoot what's so awesome I had a
blast there when Jesus and so talented I
can't believe she liked film like 18
episodes in a matter of 8 days that's
insane her work ethic is just very
inspiring but yeah I am currently on my
way back home I'm going to film a summer
lookbook or I guess finish up the summer
lookbook
yesterday I was only able to film two
outfits so oh so today I'm shooting the
rest of the three

p.m. I'm currently in the car because
Ben and I are just finishing up errands
now better picking up a print from the
signing Frank he does amazing prints he
does a lot of our friends photography
prints as well so we're grabbing a
little something from there and then
we're going to frame it back at home but
meanwhile since we're already out I'm
going to film this outfit for the summer
lookbook and then going grocery shopping
and then getting frames so really just
hopping around making a chicken tikka
masala dinner oh it's the best of the
ever better perfected a glam squad David
did an amazing eye makeup and Jenelle oh

melted my hair it's incredible alright

shoes I know I went from super glam to
absolutely nothing but you know this
shoot was super well I shot an editorial

theme was Modern Renaissance and I feel
like we really kicked all the things
that we won for the same five killer
looks

home now I am in my office and I am just
chucking away with work oh also before I
forget I need to show you guys my
shelves for my office okay and we focus
all right here we go

together this is going to be my nice
little filming room I still need to like
organize the shelves in a way that they
look more I don't know aesthetic and
then I just ordered a big print to place
over here on society6 and yeah I think

perfect for doing like intros favorites

hung all my shorts up here I just got
like a million of these clothing pins to
hang the rest of my bottoms so that's
