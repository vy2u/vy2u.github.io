- Hello everybody.
- Hey guys.
- It is Ben and Jenn
here and today's actually
a really exciting day
because we are having our
wedding food tasting today.
- It's the most exciting
part of it, I think.
It's really nice to come
back to the wedding venue,
have a look around, especially now we know
everything's a bit more in place now.
- Yeah.
- So it's exciting.
- As we were driving,
we were pretending like
we were our guests
coming to the venue, so,
it was nice.
We also brought Cheeki here.
Cheeki looks really messed
up at the moment because,
it's kind of a long story
but basically the groomers
sliced her neck.
- Yeah, well they clipped
the back of her neck
and she had to have stitches.
She's got like half a haircut
and then she's been drugged
up the last couple of days.
- Yeah.
- By the doctors, not us.
- Yeah, yeah,
so we thought it would be
nice to bring her along
because she's had a rough couple of days.
- And she can see Mowchi, her sister.
- Yeah.
- Gonna see Mowchi.
- So excited.
- See Mowchi.
- Alright, so we just got to
the tasting room and here are
our little place mats.
The sisters are back together.
Alright so here is the appetizer.
We've got some cheese
balls and a chicken satay.
And I believe this is a peanut sauce.
(piano music)
- Alright, so here is the cheeseburger.
- [Woman] Oh yeah, definitely
the grilled cheese.
- This is good!
So happy.
Look at these smiles.
(upbeat music)
How cute is this little powder room?
I'm obsessed with this wallpaper.
And also, this is my look today,
I'm wearing this little
white dress from Majorelle.
Definitely got a food baby.
Oh my God.
We ae quite a number of
dishes today and I think we've
narrowed it down to our favorites.
The tasting was incredible.
- Absolute success.
- I know, like how Ben, you're
just like, stripped down.
- [Stephanie] My sock.
- We're all just getting real comfortable.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but the tasting went so well.
We know exactly what we're
gonna pick for our wedding day
and we had a nice little walk
through of the whole venue.
And Stephanie and Ashley got to see what
everything's gonna look like.
- And Cheeki.
- And Cheeki, of course.
- [Stephanie] Hello.
- It was very successful.
It's such beautiful grounds
and the food was so,
it was a good stress to have.
- It was so shockingly good.
I had very low expectations, you know?
'Cause they always say like, oh,
wedding food's not the
best, but it was damn good.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
(dance music)
- This is where I leave Jenn.
She goes off for her
very organized chaos, I call it.
The itinerary is amazing.
Ashley has sorted out
a very good weekend.
So these guys are gonna have a lot of fun.
They will be missed.
Behave yourself, alright?
I'll see on this.
- Here's proof.
- [Girls] Yeah!
- [Jenn] You ready?
- Yeah.
- What a mission.
We finally boarded on our flight.
- Yes.
Ashley's sitting next to us over here.
- Yay!
It's gonna take us an hour to get there.
We're gonna enjoy our beverages.
- A little white wine?
- A lot of white wine.
- I got a little Perrier,
that fancy, sparkling water.
- No sodium.
But yeah, we're gonna be
enjoying our drinks then we'll be
in Vegas.
(electronic music)
We're all here, oh my goodness.
Let's go into our room, babies.
- Vegas, baby.
- [Friend] Big moment.
- [Friend] Oh my God.
- [Friend] Okay, let her walk in.
- [Friend] Oh shit.
(screaming)
- [Girls] Yeah!
- [Friend] Penthouse suite!
Woo!
(screaming)
- [Friend] Bride to be!
(screaming)
(reggae music)
- [Jenn] Oh my God, that's so nice!
Memories!
Look at all these memories,
they're so thoughtful.
She said yes.
Oh my God.
Oh my God, this is when we first hung out.
- Yeah.
- In Sophia's.
This is Beauty Con.
This is, oh my God, New York.
Oh my God, I don't even
know where this is from.
Like, where are we?
This was.
- [Friend] Your birthday.
- Mad Decent Block Party.
The Vanity Fair party.
Oh, this one's so cute.
The Hallowe'en where we
were Wayne and Garth.
Aww, this is at Snow L.A.,
which closed down unfortunately.
This is me and Ashley in Korea, 3CE.
Wait, no it's Japan, Tokyo, Tokyo, my bad.
Our Senior Graduation.
This is so cute, thanks, guys.
Alright, so here we have
the Moet machine and Sarah
is the keeper.
- Of coins.
- Of the medallions, yes, okay.
So we're gonna get one for all the girls.
Okay, so I think we're gonna
have like a rose gold moment.
So I'll do 40, oh,
six.
Oh nice.
This is so high tech.
- [Sarah] I'm just gonna
keep taking coins out.
- Sick.
It's cold.
Okay, I'm ready for my champagne.
Woo!
(cheering)
Well done.
(upbeat music)
Alright, so we got some room service.
We've got some rolls.
We've got some fried rice.
- [Ashley] Yum.
- And.
- [Friend] Pad Thai's over there.
- Pad Thai's over here.
Yum.
- [Friend] The doorbell.
- A visitor.
We just had a little snacky-poo.
And now we're gonna get
ready for the clurb.
Sarah, what kind of makeup are you look
are you gonna do today?
- I don't know, but I'm
trying to open my new
beauty blender.
- Oh, nice!
- Yeah.
- It's a fresh beauty blender.
- Yeah, so Jenn got me my
first ever beauty blender
in December, I think, and
then I just tossed it out
and got a new one.
- Oh, amazing.
- So you've converted me.
- It's, you can't go back, honestly.
Yeah, yeah, I don't know
what kind of look I'm gonna
go for today.
I think.
- [Sarah] But we're doing glitter, right?
- Yes.
Oh my gosh, I brought
(laughing)
I brought The Body Lava.
So this is my outfit for Vegas.
It is a two piece set.
I will write the brand
right over here but I really
like the way it looks.
I like playing with like golds and silver
and so that's why these
Jenny Bird earrings
are perfect for that.
And so I kind of did like
a Baby Spice hairstyle and
I just put body lava
all over my body.
So I'm gonna be ready.
So,
the girls are all dressed up.
Yes!
So tonight's dress code is
everyone is in all black.
- [Girls] Woo!
- And I am in white.
So pure.
So angelic.
Oh my God, right now we're
heading to the Crystals.
We're gonna have a little
shopping spree there.
- [Stephanie] And then eat.
- Yes, dinner.
(upbeat music)
Whoa.
Those are dope.
(laughing)
- Leo season.
- I'm all in.
Ooh, I think they fit.
Oh my God, I love them.
- [Friend] Those are cute.
- I even like it with those socks.
Celine now.
Alright, we got the seafood tower.
- Caviar on top, bro.
- Caviar on top.
Got the crabs.
Oysters.
(lounge music)
Ready to go to Encore Beach Club.
- [Group] Woo!
- Alright, Encore Beach Club.
Let's do this, baby.
(knocking)
Hello.
Welcome to the Taipei Suite
at the Mandarin Oriental.
So this is our
home away from home
for the weekend.
It's pretty sweet.
Get it?
- [Friend] Ahh!
- Okay so over here is the lovely
living room.
They sent these beautiful balloons
for the bride to be.
It is so spacious.
We have yet to chill in this space.
- [Stephanie] I think this is
the formal living room, right?
'Cause then there's that one.
- This is the T.V. lounge where,
they've actually took
away a lot of the pillows.
- [Stephanie] Oh, whoa, there
were like 20 pillows before.
But now.
- It was a lot, yeah.
- [Stephanie] My favorite area.
- Oh yeah, the bar.
- [Stephanie] The bar.
- We're gonna have a
sippin' sista here soon, so.
- [Stephanie] That would be so sick.
- That would be cool,
bachelorette edition.
- [Stephanie] Damn.
- I know.
It would have to be
something that involves Champagne.
- [Ashley] Yeah.
- We have a lot of it.
- [Stephanie] Lots, lots, lots.
- So I brought my Veuve Cliquot from home.
- [Stephanie] Hell yeah.
- And then I got
another bottle from my Instago fam.
- [Stephanie] Is it in there?
Nope.
- I got soda water.
- [Stephanie] Nope.
Where'd it go?
It might be in the kitchen.
Do you wanna show everyone the kitchen?
- Yes.
- [Stephanie] So this is the
dining room, though, first.
- Yeah, yes.
Like an art installation.
We actually have like a full,
functioning stove over here.
We got a fridge where
all our leftovers were
from Mastro's.
That's the Champagne we're talking about.
Thank you Instago fam, love you.
Should we show them your room?
- Yeah, sure.
So this is mine and Ashley's room.
- Do you wanna do your tour of your suite?
- Welcome
to my room.
Really good view.
Here you go.
- [Jenn] Here's the Vegas strip.
- This is
our bathroom.
- Wow.
Ooh, got some eyelashes.
Simple wipes.
- Yeah, all this stuff,
that's Ashley's stuff.
The tub here.
Toilet.
- [Jenn] You get to use it.
- I don't need to show you a toilet, okay?
(laughing)
Messy ass area over here.
- [Jenn] Well,
oh my gosh.
So we got these silk robes made for all
my bridal party.
We've got Stephanie's here,
the Maid of Honor, yeah.
Then we got Ashley, my
other Maid of Honor.
- [Stephanie] Door number three.
- [Jenn] Door number three.
This is where Emily
and Sophia are staying.
- Yup, they have a really
spacious room, actually.
- [Jenn] Absolutely.
- They even have a desk, too.
- [Jenn] Oh, nice.
- And they have their own little bar area.
And then their bathroom's really pretty.
Hi.
- I'm getting my makeup
done by the Sophia Chang.
- [Jenn] Oh my God.
Where do I get my appointment?
- I don't know, you gotta book it
12 months in advance.
- Oh wow, Goddamn.
Sophia Chang, the ghost.
- Yes.
- [Jenn] My gosh, well, this is Ermala,
she is getting her makeup done.
And we're just doing a little
hotel room tour.
- Cool.
Mine
versus Sophia's on the right side.
- Oh, this is my favorite.
- This is the best.
- Sunscreen right now.
- Yeah.
It's So-So.
- Hi!
- [Jenn] We're giving a
little tour of the hotel.
- I'm just doing the make
up artist duties right now.
- [Jenn] I was asking
where the wait list is
for this whole make up
appointment situation?
- Actually, next year
around March sometime.
- It's 12 months.
- [Jenn] Really?
Okay.
That's fine, that's fine.
- You know, I'll put you
in to the top of the list.
(laughing)
- [Jenn] You can pencil me in?
- I'll pencil you in.
- [Jenn] Okay, okay.
That is what friendship is.
(laughing)
- [Stephanie] And now we
have to just run back across
this crazy freaking suite.
Like I've never stayed in
a place like this before.
- Me neither.
- [Stephanie] This is insane.
This is like a once in a
lifetime kind of thing.
- I know, seriously.
- [Stephanie] Like what the?
- I know, and so I
guess the grande finale.
- [Stephanie] Is your room.
Wait, do you wanna go, wait,
wait, wait, Jenn, decision.
Bedroom or this doorway right here?
Oh, there's Sarah there!
- We can go here.
Yes.
We're doing a little hotel room tour.
- [Stephanie] Hi!
- Can you describe this
room, what this is?
- This is Jenn's favorite room.
It is the biggest room.
- [Stephanie] It's a frigging gym.
- It's a gym.
you can do some crunches here.
(laughing)
Good, crunch away the vodka.
- [Stephanie] I don't, I don't
know what the hell this is.
- It's a techno gym obviously.
- [Stephanie] Hello?
Oh!
- [Jenn] Oh, okay, it's turned on.
I mean, there's handles.
This doesn't seem right.
A walk in closet, we've got all
our outfits for the weekend.
I brought so many shoes
because I couldn't decide
on which pair.
And then this is our lovely restroom.
- [Stephanie] Just a simple
double
sink.
- Modest.
- [Stephanie] Yeah.
- [Jenn] Simple.
- [Stephanie] This is a cool design.
- I know, I've never seen a
sink that's clear like this.
- [Stephanie] Yeah.
Yeah.
- [Jenn] And then just
a simple, little vanity.
- [Stephanie] Yeah, it's so cute.
- [Jenn] We should
definitely take advantage of.
- [Stephanie] Yeah, it's so cute.
(laughing)
Look at this!
- We're gonna do this tonight.
- [Stephanie] Honestly,
we should just come back
and get in here.
- We have to.
- [Stephanie] I know.
- We literally have to.
I'll be upset if we don't.
- [Stephanie] Okay, Bridezilla.
(laughing)
- Okay, and the grand finale
is the bedroom.
Ashley's getting her make up done.
Pretty.
- [Stephanie] Let's see.
- I want the wing on it.
- Yeah, it's very, like, soft glam.
I love it.
Look at this luxurious bed.
- [Stephanie] honestly,
we can't communicate.
We need to like, call each other.
- I know.
- We can't communicate with each other,
or like walkie talkies.
- Seriously.
- 'Cause I try and yell
for you and I'm like,
I'm just gonna.
- No, there's so many, like, walls.
But it's so amazing.
- Yeah, it's awesome.
- I know, I wish we would
have bought more tickets.
Sarah, you're the first
person to showcase your haul.
- So I really needed
sunglasses in my life.
I have a really classic taste,
so I always want cat eye sunglasses.
So I chose these ones from Celine.
- [Jenn] Ooh, oh my God.
- Yeah, and they're reflective.
- [Jenn] Okay, you
gotta do a fashion show.
- I did show at lunch.
- [Jenn] Put it on, put it on, put it.
Ooh!
Dude, these are meant for your face.
- And then these were just
a spontaneous purchase
when the saleswoman was
showing us the jewelry.
So I got these earrings.
- [Jenn] Oh my God.
- They're incredibly heavy.
They're basically weights.
- [Jenn] Yeah.
- This is a physics problem.
Jenn's worlds are colliding.
- [Jenn] I know, this is crazy.
- I actually got this because
my sister has it.
I think Jackie Ina actually
gifted this to my sister for?
- [Jenn] Her birthday.
- Her birthday.
And I then I wanted it,
real, real bad.
- [Jenn] Oh my God.
It is
amazing on you.
Cute!
Da, da, da, da, da.
Da Palm Springs back pack.
- [Stephanie] Wow.
- It's finally mine, oh my God.
- [Stephanie] It really
hangs on the booty.
- I know, right?
It's like.
- [Stephanie] But you can
just shorten it, right?
Yeah, yeah, there's plenty
of options to shorten it.
- But I love it, like I
love back packs so much.
It's just what I tend towards.
- [Stephanie] Yeah.
- I hate having just one
thing slinking around.
- [Stephanie] One strap, yeah.
- [Jenn] It's so cute.
(laughing)
- So, I got this Versace
belt with studs on it.
- [Stephanie] Ooh.
- It actually fits me, it's
like the smallest size.
- [Stephanie] It's a 65, right?
- Yeah.
So.
- [Jenn] Oh my God,
it's so classic Versace.
- [Girls] Wow.
- Yeah, and I didn't
even wear it last night,
'cause I forgot to put it on.
And then I also got
these Celine glasses.
I think the name is Audrey.
- [Girls] Ooh.
- [Stephanie] Ashley loves
big, big, big sunglasses.
- Yeah, so you can't see my face.
- [Stephanie] Yeah.
Alright, Em.
- I got the Prada Cohere bag.
Out of stock.
Got the last one in the United States.
- [Jenn] Holy shit.
- I'm a Leo, so it has a lion detail.
- [Stephanie] That's crazy, dude, wow.
Wow, wow.
Good job.
And Sophia.
- Hello.
- [Stephanie] Hello.
- This is my white box.
This beautiful white box.
Oh, it's upside down.
(laughing)
My favorite brand, Celine.
I've been eyeing this purse for
four years, so.
- [Jenn] Wow!
- This is the
small box, the classic small box.
Just press this clamp.
Bam.
See that?
Good amount of space, there is a strap,
and there's a lot of space.
Very simple.
I love this bag so much.
- [Girls] Yeah!
- We're playing some games right now.
- That dress is so cute.
- [Jenn] Should I wear this out tonight?
- [Girls] Yeah.
- Alright.
♪ Like a virgin. ♪
- [Sarah] Drink if you've
ever gone skinny dipping.
Cheers if you're in the bridal party.
- Okay, that's everybody.
So now we're doing
how well do you know
the bachelorette quiz.
About to fill out these answers.
All the girls hard at work,
filling out their home work.
Pop quiz.
Okay, I met Ben
in San Franciso.
Bonus points if you wrote Delerium.
Hey!
My drink of choice is vodka soda.
- [Ashley] Extra lime, bonus points?
- That is great.
I love that.
I do love my extra lime.
I only have
one sibling.
- Wait, really?
- You know James?
- Zoom in on that face.
Rewind this and zoom in on that face.
- Hey.
- That's why I did it.
- My go to hangover food is
kimchi chi-ga.
♪ I won, I won, I won, I won ♪
♪ She won, she won, she won,
she won, she won, she won ♪
(laughing)
(&quot;Niggas in Paris&quot; by
Jay Z and Kanye West)
- [Jenn] Alright, packed
up our bags and we are
heading to the airport.
One last view of
this beautiful room.
Ugh, I'm gonna miss it
so much.
So, we just checked out of our hotel.
It was a beautiful stay.
And Ashley ordered us a car
and it ended up being a limo.
Hi guys.
So I am wrapping up the vlog here.
I have been back from Vegas two days now.
And I finally feel 100 per cent.
Not gonna lie, Sunday was very rough.
Monday, still kinda loopy.
And now today, I feel amazing.
But,
it's so crazy, just like
that my bachelorette is over.
I had such an amazing
time, but I must say,
it's gonna be really hard
to top Vegas after that.
It was such an amazing trip and
I don't know, I'm just
so sad that it's over.
But there are plenty more things
to be excited about.
I just am editing the
vlog right now and it is
so hilarious.
I can't believe,
there's like so many things
that we didn't film, either.
Like, all the stuff at
the clurb, I don't know, I
just don't like bringing my
camera when I'm out at night because,
I know myself, like I'm
probably gonna lose my camera.
So, but yeah, I am going
to sign off the blog here.
Chippo is on my lap.
But I wanted to thank you
guys so much for watching
and I'll see you guys in the next one.
Bye.
Muah.
