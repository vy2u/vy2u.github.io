- Hi everyone.
Welcome back to my channel.
Today I have a really exciting
video for you because it is
officially music festival
season and this time last year
I came out with a beauty box
with Revolve and I'm so stoked
that I've partnered with
them again to give you a new
updated beauty box with
my festival essentials.
This is my banging box and
inside there are full size
products of some of my holy grail items.
There's skin care, beauty, hair, body.
Just basically anything that's
gonna make you look tip top
from head to toe.
Without further ado let's
crack this baby open.
So the first item I wanna
share with you are these pimple
patched by CosRX.
This is a Korean brand and
so they're known for their
skin care and I've raved
about these in a favorites
before so basically you open it.
You're gonna see a clear
sheet with all these pimple
stickers on it.
Find the sticker that matches
the size of your pimple
and just pop it on your clean face.
I'll sleep with it on and
then when I wake up I'll take
the sticker off and I'll
notice that it's absorbed
all the weird residue that's in my pimple.
It's because there is hydrocolloids on it.
That is like the activating
component on this patch that's
gonna you know treat your acne.
There are 24 patches in here
so you definitely get your
money's worth in this packet.
So I have another product by CosRX.
This is their ultimate
moisturizing honey overnight mask.
And this has been one of
my favorite night creams
to use recently.
It's because it's very
hydrating but it still
feels lightweight.
It kind of feels like a gel honestly.
So I'll use this at night
after I put on my toner,
essence and serums and then
this will be like my final
step to my skin care routine.
I'll put like a pea size
amount and I'll just distribute
it all across my face and
then when I wake up I'm always
very surprised to see that
there's nothing on my face.
It's because like my face drinks it all up
and yeah it's been one of
my favorite night creams
and now it's my box.
At music festivals you're
prone to a ton of sun exposure
so I wanted to put in a
great sunscreen into my box.
This one is by Supergoop
and this is a brand that
specializes in anything
SPF or sun protection
and this is their unseen sunscreen.
And this is truly unlike any
sunscreen that I've ever used.
It literally feels like a
primer so it's got like this
translucent weightless formula
and it just blends into
the face beautifully.
Makeup sits well on top
of it and it I mean,
there's kind of like a
sunscreen smell to it but it's
not overbearing.
This sunscreen truly acts
as a great base to protect
your face.
So my next product is
this Tony Moly hand cream
and if you have been following
my channel since like 2012
then this thing and I go way back.
I'm just so happy that Tony
Moly did not discontinue this
because this is truly
my favorite hand cream.
So first off the packaging is adorable.
It's in the shape of this little peach.
Kind of looks like a nipple
but when you open it inside
there is a pot of delicious
smelling peach lotion.
Oh my gosh it's like so
tempting not to just lick it out
of the tub but this is a great hand cream.
It is very moisturizing and
honestly I can't get enough
of this scent.
Oh lord, it smells amazing.
I wish you could smell it
through the screen honestly.
So now let's move on to the
beauty products in my box.
I absolutely love Colour Pop
and so I wanted to make sure
I put three bomb shades
that you can rock at
music festivals.
First we have the color frog.
This is an icy silvery
purple with rainbow glitter.
Then we have wittle which
is a vibrant violet red
with blue and purple glitter flecks.
And lastly we have issa which
is this metallic eggplant
with blue chunky glitter.
And all three of these colors
work beautifully together.
I like to put frog in the inner corners,
I like to put wittle kind of
on the outside to blend it out
and then I'll use issa to intensify.
I think purples and blues
are such a fun pop of color
to rock on the eyes
especially during this season.
To perfect the eyes I put in
this mascara and eyeliner duo
by EyeKo and these are
both sweat resistant so
they're waterproof.
I thought that was super
important because you're just
gonna be dancing all day and night.
This eye liner is jet black
and goes one super creamy
and then I'll use the other
side which is like the brush
side and I'll use to kind
of like flick it out into a
cat eye.
Then I have this mascara and
it comes in a tube which is
great because you can really
grab all the product inside.
This has got a really dry
formula since it's waterproof.
And so it's perfect for
anyone with shorter lashes
and I just feel like this
duo is perfect for anyone
who wants mesmerizing eyes.
I know waterproof formulas
can be kind of a nightmare
to remove so I've included
these eye makeup remover wipes
by Eyeko.
These are great to travel with
and super convenient to use.
The eyes are such like a
delicate area so you don't wanna
use products that are really
gonna tug and kind of like
mush around the area because
it's so prone to wrinkles
so that's why I wanted to
include a product that just
removes makeup with ease.
Now to finish off the face I
have this lip color by Ilia.
Of course it is my signature
salmony pink shade.
I just live for colors like
these and I think that they go
really great with anything
like smoky on top because it
adds like a slight flush
of color but it's not gonna
be overbearing.
This is definitely more of
like a lightweight formula
so you're gonna need a liner
or you can just like foundation
as a base and then put
the lipstick over it.
So now I'm gonna move on
to some hair products.
If you know me you know that
I love and I cannot live
without dry shampoo.
So I put in this one by R + CO.
I would've loved to use
their aerosol version but
aerosols would've just like
made the shipping a lot more
difficult so the powder
form is awesome too.
Do not be alarmed by the formula.
It's just as simple.
You just section off your
hair, you put a line of powder
in between all the sections
and then you just massage
the formula into your scalp.
The powder's just gonna
absorb all your oil
and it's gonna leave your
hair feeling voluminous
and smelling good and fresh
for any days of the festival.
So now I have the Ouai's wave spray.
If you love effortless beachy
waves this is definitely
the product for you.
This honestly works best
when your hair is like half
wet half dry but in the
demonstration clip I just use
it on dry hair.
I just really saturate the
mist all into my hair until
it's damp.
Kind of scrunch it up and
then I'll braid my hair into
two sections.
I just use the normal like
easy three strand braid
and then when you release it
you're just gonna have these
really beachy curls.
If you want more of like a
structured curl you're definitely
gonna still go in with like a
curling wand and just fix like
the pieces that frame your
face or any stragglers that
didn't make the cut.
So now let's finish this
off with some body products.
This is a body oil by French Girl.
And this is really gonna
keep your body nice
and moisturized during that desert heat.
I've noticed that when you
have body oil on suddenly you
just look a lot more toned.
I think it's just like
the way your skin glistens
with the oil.
But think about it, when you
watch like a bodybuilding
competition like everyone's
always greased up so this is
like the same type of concept
but definitely dialed back.
A lot of music festivals
are really spread out
and so I wanted to make sure
that I had all your travel
essentials covered.
This is the brand that the Ace Hotel uses.
And that's when I first got exposed to it.
So inside there is a face
cleanser, face moisturizer,
a body wash, a body moisturizer,
and shampoo and conditioner.
So yes you're gonna have
everything needed from head
to toe literally.
For my final product I
have this deodorant by
Malin + Goetz.
This is their cult favorite.
It smells exactly like eucalyptus.
Ugh, it smells so good.
And I love that there
are no parabens in here.
There's no aluminum.
And I know aluminum is like
a key ingredient in a lot
of deodorant and it's just
not the best for you so this
doesn't have any of that so
you just slap it underneath
your arms.
I mean I can just put a little
on right now to demonstrate.
But it smells great.
This is gonna keep your
underarms fresh throughout
the entire festival.
Alright guys those were all
the products inside my box.
I know it was like a large
amount but it was really hard
to whittle everything
down because I truly loved
every single thing inside this box
and I wanted to be like all encompassing.
Even if you're not going to
any music festivals this season
I feel like these
essentials still can apply
and if you are heading out
to Coachella please do not
be afraid to say to me if you see me.
I would love to come and meet you.
I will leave a link in the
description in case you are
interested in purchasing and
I will see you guys next time.
Bye.
(blows kiss)
