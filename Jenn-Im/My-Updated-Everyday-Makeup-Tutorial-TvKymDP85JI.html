but I'm filming a full-blown updated
makeup tutorial and this is just one of
my everyday makeup routines I have
around three or four now but I felt like
doing this one today and it's been a
year since I've filmed my very first one
and a lot has changed so here is my bare
naked face filled with discoloration
sparse brows uneven eyelids just
everything as you can see I'm not
perfect I always moisturize first today
I'm using NYX dramatically different
moisturizing lotion I squirt around a
pump and a half of this and I just
spread it all across my face making sure
I don't leave out any random spots to
make sure everything is moisturized
after that's down I put some sunscreen
on I'm using Shiseido's oil-free you
protector see guys I said to Sado right
this time anyway I shake the living crap
out of it because it says to shake and
then I begin to apply it on I'm
beginning to really like how watery this
consistency is because it just feels
really just doesn't feel thick
underneath my skin which is something I
can really appreciate I can't forget to
moisturize my lips so I'm using Nivea's
milk and honey and it's a great balm one
that it grows quickly and smells bomb
now moving on to foundation I'm using
makeup Forever's HD foundation and n20
this foundation is something I bought a
few months ago when I realized that my
previous foundation was just completely
off a little bit goes a long way so I'm
glad I splurged on it and I first just
apply it just all across my face and
then I'll use this Sigma flat kabuki
stippling brush
I think stippling brush and then I just
kind of buff it all across my face to
make sure everything is just evenly on
my skin for under-eye concealer i'm
using maybelline instant age rewind
eraser dark circles this one is in light
and i use this underneath both my eyes
and as I will demonstrate I use it
underneath my eyes and on the bridge of
my nose to create more dimension I
suppose not sure if it makes a vast
difference but I don't know it's the
thought that counts then I use my second
Maybelline age rewind err in the shade
medium as just a regular concealer and
then I apply that underneath my lips the
corners of my nose and just some random
spots and then I just continue to blend
all the way out after that's finished
instead of powdering I like to move
right into bronzer I use NYC sunny to
add some golden as' to my skin and I use
a large angled contour brush to apply
this and I know a lot of people use
broadens are after they've powdered but
I like to put it on before because that
way it doesn't rub off throughout the
day and I and when I put it first the
powder just seems to seal it in and I
never have to reapply it and for
application I just make kind of a three
shape on my cheeks and I guess that's it
it's time for powder now I'm using NARS
is translucent powder and I use a fluffy
blending brush first to apply it
underneath the delicate parts of my skin
like underneath my eyes and also just
the hard to get corners like in between
my nose and our eye mouth and then after
I've got all the details then I move in
with my large powder brush and then I
just apply it all across my face and
then it just locks everything in place
and seals all my hard work
moving on to brows unfortunately I was
not blessed with strong brows so I'm
just gonna draw them in I'm using dark
horse from the Naked palette and I'm
using a freaking paint brush that I got
at Michael's around two years ago
whatever whatever works right then I'm
going to just apply the dark horse on
the just the meat of my brow as if that
makes sense don't even touch the edges
just work on just the place where
there's the most hairs and then you're
done just
then I'm going to go in with Anastasia's
brow wiz and then I'm going to really
get in that brow option by just
physically drawing the eyebrows if you
don't have brows whatever just draw them
in and you gotta just make it work and
just look at that face of concentration
I don't know what to say then I use my
spoolie to blend it all out and then I
like to set my brows with this no-name
brow gel I can't remember where I got it
was either Rite Aid or CVS but this
thing used to be clear so let's zoom
into the eye makeup stuff I first use
Urban Decay's eye primer potion
I got this off outlook and I got it from
really cheap because it's still in that
old bottle and then I add a little bit
to each eye and then I try to blend this
out to the best of my abilities and now
my eyes are all primed then to add some
eyeshadow base for my highlight I'm
using the shimmery pale jumbo stick from
Wet n Wild it's around dollar and most
excellent now you're going to want to
apply this to the inner thirds of your
eyes and here are some words of
encouragement now it's time to use a
darker base this is Urban Decay's
Rockstar it's this really dark dusty
plum color super versatile because you
can use it for any smokey eye base and
then I add a dark matte Brown a matte
dark brown eyeshadow from this trio and
I just apply it on top of the base the
trick is to blend as best as you can
I mean there's going to be times where
your eyes are uneven but eventually
you'll just get the hang of it just
practice makes perfect
then I'm going to use T's from Naked 2
palette as a blending color I'm using a
fluffy brush from ELF and just use that
to seamlessly transition the shadows to
the color of your flesh and this is
optional this is if you want to take it
to the next level now I'm going to take
it to the next level
you're gonna get a dark or a
black matte shade and just apply it to
the outer thirds of your eyes for a
really intense look now it's time to
highlight I'm using booty call from
naked to apply this to where you put the
pale shimmery highlight base that we
previously did to just enhance the look
also I'm going to apply it to the brow
bone for more dimension now that's out
of the way I'm using Milan ease eyeliner
in espresso I'm using that to line the
outer lower thirds of my eyes and then
I'm going to use a smudge brush and just
blend that all out then for eyeliner I
use Maybelline's line stiletto still
using this haven't found anything better
I still feel the same about it
from when I first use it which was two
years ago now it's whatever it's like
the best whatever I just I'm just not in
love with it I'm still in the market for
a new eyeliner okay anyway you're gonna
want to make a baby cat eye shape and
here's a legitimate question for you all
does anyone else needs every time they
do eyeliner or mascara I sneeze every
time and it's really annoying then I'm
gonna curl my lashes using this one from
Shiseido and then I'm moving on to
mascara with benefits they're real and
yes my lashes are real they're sparse
and very sad anyway I'm going to coat my
lashes so they're somewhat visible I'm
gonna do the best I can
unfortunately I wasn't blessed with
luscious lashes like some of y'all
anyway since I can't do much at the top
I'm gonna really play with my bottom
lashes I'm gonna go out on the town with
these I just try to cook them as best as
I can and as thick as I can while the
bottom lashes are drying I go back with
Maybelline's the falsies and I go right
back on top and just give them a nice
little extra coat and I find that these
add a little bit more length and sure
they look a little bit spidery but can
you have not only lashes like I do
spider lashes are better than no lashes
so this is the look
voila we're going to move on to blush
this is benefits coralista
and it adds a nice punch of coral to
your cheeks and this has a little bit of
shimmer to it which is nice in case you
don't want to go in and highlight but I
like to highlight anyway because putting
makeups fun I'm using benefits what's up
and I apply this to the highest portion
of my cheek and then I'm going to blend
it with my finger dude we're coming to
the end of the road I'm finishing off my
lips with 3 concept eyes lip liqueur and
Quan bond and this color is just
stunning it's a peach nude color perfect
to pair with smokey eyes and doesn't
that just look delicious I just love the
color of it I think I just really like
peaches anyway just I'm letting my hair
down now and we're finished with the
look there's a close-up of my eyes and I
hope this has been too excruciating to
listen to this is only my second time
ever filming a makeup tutorial and if
you guys liked it I'd really appreciate
it if you would like that button on the
corner to indicate that you would like
more makeup tutorials and I will see you
guys next time
oh but before I leave for sure given
Instagram my user name is I'm Jen M it

my face and here's some extra kisses for
you guys and a little bit of tongue
action in case you're into that stuff
