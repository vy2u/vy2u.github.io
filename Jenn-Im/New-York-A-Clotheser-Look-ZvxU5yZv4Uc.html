Fashion Week I'm only staying here for a
couple of days because Ben and I have to
make it back to California on time for
Valentine's Day weekend I'm only going
to be here for a couple of shows I'm
going to a Sherri Hill fitting today for
her show tomorrow and that's pretty much
the highlight of the week we are staying
at the Hudson hotel I will give you a
room tour once it's nice and spruced up
got a lot of stuff packed an itinerary
for today and you are coming along you
guys I've had this pair of heatTech
socks for at least two years now
and I can finally open them because the
temperature is right okay maybe not two
years maybe like a year
hey guys just checking in i finished my
fitting at Sherri Hill it went awesome I
picked out this beautiful black
embellished dress and I'm so excited to
wear it it's got beading on the front
and then it is like a bandage dress it's
killer I can't wear it tomorrow to the
show and right now we're heading out to
Soho to get a scarf for Ben because he
didn't bring one where he called it was
used to it something I'll be fine now so
you're just gonna step into you a couple
stores and Soho and do a little shop
so the shopping trip went well Ben did
get a spark on the end but now we are
actually a Thai restaurant or about to
have dinner before the show tonight it's
like a measuring tape and freaking hold
anything to add
we have got my Sephora with a partisan
fashion show so I'm not used to this
kind of thing so I'm just going to sit
there and level it's going to get very
happy with finally war

freezing I'm wearing this really nice
fuzzy thing that is shedding all over
Ben's coat unfortunately

Charlotte to get here so we can head on
over to the content for your show all

come inside the room and everything is
nice and wooden got a nice bed here and
a gorgeous little view of the city so
moving back got a television here
minibar Rock so there's nothing in here
it's just a fridge with leftovers from
breakfast and here is I guess the common
area I've got some beautiful white
chairs and we've got a balcony but they
won't let us open it so I guess we could
just admire it from inside here's the
nice desk area where you can get some
work done and a second television hey

Central Park now we just realized how
