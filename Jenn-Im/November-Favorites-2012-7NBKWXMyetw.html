since it's the beginning of December
it's time for November favorites so
let's just get into it I've seen this
product really pushed at me on those
YouTube commercials you know that
30-second commercial before you can
watch the actual YouTube video well
they've been really pressing these downy
UNSTOPABLES on me and I didn't think it
was gonna get to me but when I saw this
product just hanging on a lone shelf at
Target I couldn't help myself I had to
have it and I bought it and I loved it
and I feel really ashamed basically this
product is just an instant booster so
it's not a soap it just makes your
clothes smell really really good and by
now I'm pretty sure you guys know that I
love the smell of laundry detergent but
I think it's hard to find a detergent
that really sticks to your clothing and
this is the problem that does it you
pour as little or as much as you want
and I liked pour in one cup and then a
little bit more so I can really you know
saturate my clothing so I just smell
like the perfect laundromat and I love I
love using this on my bedsheets our to
wear sweaters I was reading some reviews
about this online just to see what the
cons were I guess and a lot of people
have problems with irritation when they
wash this with their underwear or their
boxers or just any sort of undergarment
I don't think the chemical properties of
this are very good for soft membranes on
the human body so I would just kind of
forgo your your undies if you guys seen
my video out of the towel on finding a
fragrance you probably already know this
but it's Versace she's bright crystal
and it is my official signature scent
I've been trying to make this a ritual
I've been spraying on my wrists and on
my neck and I love it it smells so good
it's the perfect blend of fruit and
floral it's just a really nice balance
and I find that a lot for other
fragrances kind of distort throughout
the day as they begin to fade but this
one fades very gradually and gracefully
and I think it just stays really true to
its scent the downside of the spray is
that it doesn't last very long I think a
spritz less maybe two hours and then
your duns oh but then again I don't
really know a lot of the lifespan
of other fragrances so tell me is this
normal for a fragrance tip and not fast
I'm originally from Southern California
so I've been spoiled with the awesome
weather down there but since I came up
north it's been a lot colder I realized
last year I didn't know how to layer up
properly so I'd be wearing a sweater
just a sweater and then it were a jacket
and a scarf and I'd still be really cold
I realized that you need a thermal I
know it seems like common sense still
are you guys but it didn't click with me
it's weird so I went to Urban Outfitters
and I got a bunch of thermals and this
is one my favorite ones I love how it's
a boatneck because now I can wear
sweaters that are a more off the
shoulder or something and it's for a
really neutral color which I love and
the thermal really helps retain warmth
and adds just a few degrees to your body
which are very crucial when you are
absolutely freezing outside so my next
favorite is a jewelry piece and there
are these earrings they're the eye of
raw or the eye of course and it's the
Egyptian symbol for good health
protection and royal power and I got
these on sale on Urban Outfitters on the
website and I've been wearing these
non-stop I think they go with absolutely
everything it's so weird I've been
putting up my hair a lot in a ponytail
so I think these are just really good
accents on my ears and I think they're a
great conversation piece
I saw another movie in theaters and it's
called the master and I think it's still
playing and it is a phenomenal film it's
kind of a Hollywood rendition of what
Scientology is although the producers
deny it but it's about Scientology and
ron Hubbard I've always been kind of
curious about Scientology because
whenever I'm walking in LA or I stuff
I'll see this really sexy elaborate
building and I just be wondering well
where did this come from can I go inside
is it a store but usually it's a
Scientology building and they just kind
of want to induct you I've never been it
if any of you guys are Scientologists or
have been inducted please let me know
what the process is like I'm pretty
curious anyway back to the movie the
acting in this film is amazing Joaquin
Phoenix and Phillip Hoffman do an
amazing job like they're their chemistry
on-screen is just so raw and realistic
like it gives me hope for where the film
industry is going today you guys gotta
go check it out before it's nine figures
anymore so those are all my favorites
it's not a very expensive list but I
I've been pretty mellow this month I
would love to hear what you guys have to
say about any of my favorites if any of
these things kind of sparked something
in your mind please let me know just
write it out if you guys have an
Instagram my user name is I'm Jenna I
would love it if you follow me on there
well I'll see you guys my next video and
thanks so much for watching see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
