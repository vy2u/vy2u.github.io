you with another round of favorites
because it's the beginning of the month
so I'm going to rewind and talk about my
November favorites I'm gonna start off
with the most obvious favorite which is
a beret I've been wearing them non-stop
and it got particularly intense in
November like any chance like god I
popped on a beret and I think I just
like them because I mean first off I'm a
heavy hat advocate and second of all
they're kind of like a fancy beanie and
this one in particular has been one of
my favorites this one is from the cupola
and I like this one because it's quite
structured and it's very unique I also
thought I should do a shout out to this
beret this is my very very first beret
from aardvarks and this has been with me
since the beginning of this channel
it's like pilling and it's not in the
best condition but I can't part with it
I love it too much and I will show you
the rest of my Berets and my upcoming
how to style berets lookbook video that
should be out later this month I filmed
it already I just need to edit it so
stay tuned for that one moving on to
makeup favorites I've been over the moon
for colourpop's ultra matte lips two
shades in particular the first is
stingray which is what I'm wearing on my
lips right now my friend ray actually
created this you may know her as it's my
ray ray on YouTube and she did such an
amazing job with this color on me it
looks kind of like a deep berry / dusty
mauve it's so hard to describe colors
and my second favorite is deeper and
this is the shade that I wore in my
October favorites and a lot of you guys
were wondering what I was wearing my
lips I put it in the description box but
just to remind you guys it was B / and
yeah this is kind of like a dusty Brown
on me this formula is almost too good to
be true it's ultra matte it doesn't
really budge when you're eating and it's
only six dollars a pop pretty awesome I
have always wanted to travel to Iceland
and I haven't had the opportunity yet
but it's still my bucket list but
Stephanie actually got to travel to
Iceland last month with her family and
she brought me back something because
she's amazing
it is the silica mud mask from the Blue
Lagoon I've been using this twice a week
and I'll leave it on for five to ten
minutes and it just rinses right
and after my skin just feels super soft
it feels very cleansed and I don't know
my skin's been really happy with it it's
hypoallergenic it's fragrance and
paraben free so it's very unlikely that
you'll break out from this my movie
favourite last month is chef and it's
just a feel-good film and I recommend it
to you if you're a foodie Ben told me to
watch it and he knows him really well
because I loved it and it's just about a
chef that quits his job at this really
fancy like hoity-toity restaurant
because he found it kind of like
limiting and so he starts his own
business and it's just a really great
film I'm just gonna leave it at that
because I don't want to spoil too much
but yeah it's just a really awesome film
about rediscovering passion and the
power of social media even and yeah I
really liked it it's on Netflix so if
you have nothing to watch tonight I
highly recommend it
moving on to book favorites I have a
really great one for you guys it's
called ready player one by Ernest Cline
and this was actually recommended to me
by a ton of you after I announced
Ender's Game in a previous favorites in
the past and I don't know why it took me
this long to read it because this is one
of my favorite books now seriously like
I got sucked into it and I absolutely
love it of course it is a sci-fi novel
it takes place in the Year 2044 and the
world is just destroyed on it's just
kind of like on its way out a lot of
people just escape reality by going into
a virtual world called the Oasis and the
Oasis is kind of like if the matrix and
the internet had a baby the main
character is a teenage boy named Wade
and you just kind of follow the world
through his eyes and his adventure is
gonna take you on a crazy roller coaster
and just a heads up there are a lot of
gaming and 80s references in there but
it's not necessary for you to know them
to understand or follow along you're
gonna be just fine if anything you're
just gonna have a list of 80s films you
need to watch my last favorite is
actually another book it is called the
little book of skin care and my friend
Charlotte actually wrote this and it's
so amazing I've seen her working on this
since like the beginning of the year and
I just can't believe it's finally out
now it's all about Korean beauty skin
care and if you are at a beauty junkie
you're gonna absolutely love this or
even if you're just interested on
getting started on skincare this will
tell you all the steps that you need
product reviews testimonies and the
little illustrations are so cute look
also I have a small cameo in the book on
page 202 I believe and so I don't know I
feel pretty damn good about being
published in a book even if it's only a
paragraph but yeah I am actually gonna
do a giveaway there are gonna be two
winners the winners are gonna receive a
copy of this book and three Korean
Beauty skincare products so all you're
gonna need to do for the giveaway is to
leave a comment just one comment per
person and just tell me your name where
you're from and what kind of skin type
you are that way we can really pick out
what products that are gonna be
complimentary for your skin and yeah
that's it and that concludes my November
favorites and December is gonna be a
crazy month because I'm doing my own
version of vlogmas I'll be vlogging
every day but all the vlogs are gonna be
packed in into one video that I post
every Friday so there's gonna be four
videos and the series is called jungle
Belles
so get ready for that vlogging everyday
is definitely pretty intense but um I'm
gonna commit to it I think I got it
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you in the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
