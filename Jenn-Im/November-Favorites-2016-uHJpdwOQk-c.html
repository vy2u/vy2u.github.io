well into December and I believe this is
the latest favorites I've ever done but
you know what I thought it's better late
than never so let's get on with the
program I'm gonna kick things off with a
fashion favorite this is the long-sleeve
shirt that I was rockin all of November
and this is from Stan nonde obviously I
was attracted to this because of the
writing a lot of you guys were confused
about what this t-shirt meant and I
thought I would break it down for you
guys so the first sentence basically
says that the speaker would rather
cuddle first and then have kiss after
because it's using this ven rather than
then and the second sentence explains
that if you are good with grammar then
you would have noticed that they used
this then and you would have understood
the first sentence and if I'm gonna be
completely honest I didn't understand
this shirt and that's what I liked about
it but I think a couple of you guys
explained it in the comments down below
and I was like holy it all clicked
for me so yeah now this shirt has been
unlocked and it's been deciphered my
next favorite is gonna be a lip color
this is smash boxes out loud and it's
part of their always-on liquid lipstick
line every time I wear this on camera I
get comments from you guys asking me
what it is and so I thought I should do
a shout out I'm wearing it on my lips
right now it's this beautiful burnt
sienna color that I think is so perfect
for the Fall and I guess winter because
we're in December now and I love the
formula of this even though it's a
liquid lipstick it's not drying it's
super long-lasting and it's super easy
to apply because of the little
application wand it's a nice little doe
foot and I think this color would look
amazing on any sort of skin tone or
complexion I've got another beauty item
for you this time it is a highlighter
this is called yummy cookies and it's by
the color pop and Hello Kitty collection
normally I'm more of a powder
highlighter girl but this changed the
game for me so I found out how to
correctly use this and so how I like to
use it as I grab my damp Beauty Blender
and on the flat end I'll just kind of
twist it on it and then
I will dab it on the apples of my cheeks
my nose bridge and all my Cupid's bow
and I find that this glow looks a lot
more natural and dewy because it's not
so dusty and I just think it looks a lot
more like fresh-faced if you know what I
mean
also this is only five or six dollars so
it's definitely a bang for your buck
of course I gotta talk about my Madrid
collaboration for those who don't know I
came out with a jewelry collection and
it's called links and this is something
that I've been working on for so so long
and it was so amazing finally getting to
release it it is a total of seven pieces
it's three chokers and necklaces that
come in gold and silver and then one
ring ever since I got my collection I
have been wearing at least one piece at
all times like this ring has not left my
hand since I got it I wash my hands in
this I shower in this even though you're
not supposed to but still it hasn't
turned my body green it's not tarnished
in any way it's still shiny and that's
when I know that it's super high quality
it's something that's gonna last me a
long time it was such a cathartic moment
having this all be released and I just
can't wait to see what the pieces look
like on you if you ordered and receive
the pieces definitely take a photo and
share it with me I would love to see it
and like your photo and comment it's
just crazy
because we named this collection links
because when we rock these pieces it's
gonna link us all together I definitely
go into more in depth with all the
pieces in my jewellery line video I'll
leave the link here so definitely check
it out this month's book favorite is
called unwind by Neal Shusterman if you
watched my Jen member episodes and you
actually saw me spurs start this book
this was actually recommended by a
handful of you guys in previous
favorites videos and the comment section
so I want to thank you guys for
recommending me this I know it took a
while I bought this on Amazon like at
the beginning of the year but cracked it
open November and I was not disappointed
at all this is obviously a sci-fi novel
and yes it's a dystopia but in this
world children or teens from the ages 13
to 18 they can get unwound by their
parents and being unwound means that the
child's organs are all transplanted into
different donors but
they're technically still alive it's
pretty freaky this book is told in the
perspective of three teens uh two boys
and one girl and it's just it's just
captivating there's so much action that
goes on and it's really easy to read
because this is definitely a young adult
novel but man this is it's gripping you
can't put this down I love that this
book touches on issues about pro-life
and pro-choice it's definitely pretty
political highly recommended if you're
looking for a book to just smash out in
a couple of days good book I believe
this is also like a trilogy or something
but I think this book stands well on its
own I don't think I'm gonna read unholy
because I'm happy with the way
everything ended for my miscellaneous
favorite I have a dog food called ollie
ever since I got cheeky I have been
researching on how to give her the best
life possible and that includes her food
when I discovered Ollie that's when it
kind of clicked and I was like oh my
gosh this is amazing it's human grade
nutritious food and the best part about
it is that it gets delivered to my door
every month so it comes in a big box and
it's already refrigerated inside because
it has like I think it's like some dry
ice in there or something but anyway my
food for the month comes in and then
I'll put most of it in the freezer and
then I'll leave one in the fridge to
fall out and cheeky goes nuts for this
stuff and the way I feed it to her is
I'll stuff it into these Kong balls and
so I'll give her four a day
and I like to put it in the combos
because it makes her work for it my
trainer said that you shouldn't just
give a dog food just in a bowl because
it's gone in seconds you want to make
your dog kind of work for it because
it's a natural hunter it takes her like
a good 15 to 20 minutes to eat it and by
the end of it she's full she's happy and
her mind's a little drained all in all I
think this is a great dog food I know
it's a little crazy for you to just get
like a specific delivery service for
your dog but I mean chicky means the
world to me and I would do anything for
her and that includes her food alright
guys those were my November favorites
and I just have a couple updates for you
yes I am doing vlogmas or my version of
it it's called jungle Belles I'm still
compiling all the days so it should be
out probably next week if I'm gonna be a
realistic because I'm still doing normal
programming it's not just me vlogmas and
number two I went to Lake Tahoe
over the weekend and I had such a blast
it was amazing it was a true vacation
and I it was just really therapeutic for
me
but unfortunately Ben broke his wrist in
two places while he went snowboarding um
so we've been doing with that it's been
 crazy if I'm gonna be completely
honest but he's okay now
we're still waiting to see if we need
surgery so it's been tough but you know
 happens in life and you just got to
deal with it step-by-step and number
three Ben and I are going to Hawaii
regardless he's in a cast now but I mean
we've been planning this Hawaii trip for
like months now and so to cancel it ah
it's just weird we're just not doing
that we're just gonna kind of press on
we're just gonna relax there it's gonna
be good but the thing is I don't know
what to do in Hawaii so for those who do
know what to do feel free to write down
your recommendations obviously we're
gonna have a chilled one because he's
gonna he's gonna need a heal so yeah if
you guys have any good restaurants or
like cool beaches or something you
definitely write it in the comments down
below
mostly food recommendations please we're
about to eat real good there anyway I
want to thank you guys so much for
watching and obviously write down your
faves in the comments too and yeah
that's it I will talk to you guys later
bye
