added another notch to 2016 by finishing
another month and since October is dunzo
I thought I'd chat about some of my
favorites like I do every month so let's
get started so my first favorite is
gonna be a fashion item I've been
wearing the living crap out of these
jeans these are from Stalin onda and I
am just a freak for distressed nests
especially on the ends this is such a
huge fall trend and I'm soaking it all
in also this is something that you can
easily DIY get a pair of flared jeans in
your closet get a pair of scissors cut
it haphazardly throw in the wash and you
should get something like this
my next favorite has got to be at this
backpack from rola if you've seen my
recent what's in my bag video then this
backpack is no surprise to you but for
those who didn't check it out I highly
recommend you guys watch it by clicking
here let's just say it's not your
average what's in my bag video this is
just a really high-quality everyday
backpack and although it looks pretty
small don't underestimate this you can
stuff a lot of your belongings in here
even my Canon t3i fits in here and that
thing is not small I really love the
straps because you can wear it
conventionally as a backpack two straps
or you can just have it as one strap and
just kind of swing it casually on your
shoulder and that's the way I normally
rock it next up is an accessory check
out these bad boys these are from
general monster which is a Korean brand
I believe these are my third pair of
general monsters and I have a feeling
that that count is just gonna keep
rising this brand does an amazing job on
creating sunglasses for Asian faces
because believe me it's a struggle
I just love polarized lenses and these
lenses are in a nice warm gold shade and
I think they're gonna really complement
all my autumn outfits and what really
takes the cake though is this little
hair detail on the side this is just
next-level and I actually got these
sunglasses at a store called I holux in
Koreatown my girl sophia has been dying
to take me there and we finally went
last week and that's where I got these
for my beauty item I have a cult
favorite which is it
10 miracle leave-in product I was
randomly shopping at Ulta and I saw this
on a rack
picked it up gave it a go and ended up
loving it I like to apply this on
freshly wet hair my first step is to use
whens anti frizz styling cream and then
I'll follow up with this guy and I will
spray very generously on my strands with
this product and this helps just
detangle any knots and just makes my
hair a lot more manageable I feel like I
can take a lot better care of my hair
and I feel like this is a positive step
forward like most people I am a Netflix
freak and just when I thought I saw all
this series that I wanted to see I don't
know her pops black mirror is this crazy
like season 3 came out and all of a
sudden I got all these recommendations
to watch it and I am so glad I did
because if you're a sci-fi junkie like
me you're gonna go nuts over the show
it's really cool because every episode
is completely different not related so I
just started off watching season 3
episode 1 and that episode was so good
it's called nose dive and it's a really
great commentary on social media and our
bizarre obsession with it and the dark
effects it can have on the mind and it
was filmed beautifully and a great first
episode to dip your toes in I don't
think this is a series that you should
really kind of binge watch because it's
a lot of information all at once and I
feel like with my brain at least I can't
handle so many storylines on one day so
definitely take your time with it season
3 only has six episodes and then 1 &amp;amp; 2
only have like 3 or 4 so take your time
with it
savor each one and let me know what you
think my last favorite is a book and it
is the 7 Habits of Highly Effective
People by Stephen Kobe and I feel like
this is a book that everybody in the
world should read because it could only
benefit them this has inspired me to
become a better person and the best
version of myself I've been done with
school for a couple years and if I don't
actively search for reading material I
feel like my brain would just turn into
mush and I also have a job where if I'm
not self-motivated I will crash and burn
so this book kind of came at the perfect
time of my life I think the author does
such an amazing job describing each of
these habits because he attaches so many
stories so many examples for each one so
it's difficult
to forget and with these habits he's
divided them into three sections so the
first section is called private
victories so these are the habits that
you can only control by yourself
the only concern you the second section
is called public victories so these
habits are going to involve other people
and your interactions with other people
and the last section is just called
sharpening the saw and that is just
explaining that everything comes in
waves and cycles and you're eventually
going to renew yourself again and it's
about staying on top of your game I feel
like I feel like the way I'm explaining
this is gonna sound like buzz words or
terms that are gonna fly over your head
but once you read this book you'll
understand the context behind everything
and I just feel like this book came at
such a perfect time in my life because
these days it's it's really easy to
become complacent and content with the
way things are or if something's
bothering you it's easy to blame other
people or the situation or your genetics
or you know whatever the hell everything
but you but I feel like this book has
kind of opened my eyes in my mind to be
more of a proactive thinker and I just I
just constantly want to evolve I
constantly want to grow and I just love
absorbing sound advice like this and I
just highly recommend this book that's
all I'm gonna say jobs like alright guys
so those were my October favorites as
always please share with me your
favorites in the comments down below
also I am filming Jen vember so I'll be
vlogging every day in November until
Thanksgiving there's a lot as like a
holiday in fall so it makes it easy for
you to like vlog until a certain date
cuz I feel like the entire month would
be a little crazy so yeah Jen member is
happening

October when I was only doing a week I
was like that's it so I think I'm ready
