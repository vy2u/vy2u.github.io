- Hey, everyone, it's your
girl Jenn, and welcome back.
We are doing a favorites today
because it's the end of the
month, you know the drill.
Honestly, October was
kind of scattered for me.
I felt all over the place.
I held it together, but it was kinda hard.
(laughs)
I don't know, how was your October?
Let me know in the comments down below.
Yeah, let's focus on the positives,
and let's dive right into the favorites.
First up on the agenda, we
gotta talk about these boots.
These are from Dolls Kill, and I love
how chunky and '90s they are.
I have always been attracted
to big, clunky boots
because they just look badass,
and they're also very
comfortable because of the heel,
and these are no exception.
They are a little bit heavy,
but I just consider
them like ankle weights,
so it's just making me work out harder
when I'm just wandering around.
It's like a two in one, you look good,
and you burn more calories.
They have a really cool
ring detail on the zipper,
so they're very easy to slide up and down,
and I think they add a perfect
amount of edge to any outfit.
Whether it's a dress,
or pants, it looks sick.
Now I'm moving straight into a book.
I don't really have that many beauty
and fashion favorites this month.
I think I was just really focusing
on what was in here, and
one of my favorite books
that I read this month was
What I Know For Sure by Oprah.
I have always admired and respected Oprah,
but I was never curious enough
to really see her path, and
how she got to where she was.
I just knew that she was self-made,
but my friend Amy is obsessed with her,
and she said a quote by
Oprah about, I don't know,
something about people's journeys
and people's experiences,
but basically, that propelled me to just
download the book on my Kindle,
and it has been so amazing.
Basically, this book is about Oprah
explaining what she's
learned throughout her life,
and believe me, she is not only wealthy,
but she is rich in knowledge and wisdom.
I just really look up
to her even more now,
and my respect for her
has doubled tenfold.
She's incredible, and if
you're looking for a book
that is gonna inspire
you, and to remind you
of the simple things in life,
like finding joy in the
first sip of coffee,
or walking your dog, or
just breathing in sage,
it's just a very relaxing book to read,
and it's been really nice
to finish my nights off
with pages from the book.
Highly recommend you check it out,
and it's a very easy read.
For my next favorite, I
have this reading light
that I got from Ben.
It was a present from
him because, obviously,
we sleep in the same bed, and sometimes,
he wants to go to sleep,
but I want to read,
but I want to read in bed.
The light situation has been
an issue, but not anymore.
I have this amazing portable little light.
You clip it right on your Kindle,
and it has two light settings.
One's bright, and then
one's even brighter.
It's just really, really convenient,
and you can travel with it,
and it's gonna be amazing
to read on planes,
especially for night flights,
because I know there's
a reading light on top,
but I just feel like, when it's on,
I'm inconveniencing
everybody 'cause it's like,
&amp;quot;The light is on.&amp;quot;
Even though it's just
directing, technically, at you,
it's still illuminating the general area,
so I feel like this would
eliminate that problem,
and I just love it.
If you have a Kindle, I
highly recommend this.
If you don't have a
Kindle, I highly recommend
you get a Kindle, because, I mean,
a lot of people ask me, &amp;quot;Oh,
Jenn, how do you find time
&amp;quot;to read so much?&amp;quot;
I really think it's because
of my Kindle because,
if there's a book I want to read,
I'll literally just go
on the Kindle store,
and I just get it.
I mean, some books are, like, 12 bucks,
but all in all, they're all
roughly five or six dollars,
and it's totally worth it, very immediate.
I just highly recommend it.
Next up, I gotta give a shoutout
to Raw Unfiltered Apple Cider Vinegar.
That's a very provocative name.
Yeah, I've heard so many health
benefits from drinking this,
but I didn't get around to
start drinking it until now
because I'm getting older, and I just want
to live as long as I possibly can,
so I want to take care of myself.
Basically, every day,
around the afternoon,
I'll get one tablespoon, put it in a cup,
and then I'll fill the
rest of the cup with water,
and I'll just chug it.
It's very, very crucial
that you mix it with water,
or else it'll just burn your throat.
This scent ...
(bottle hisses)
Oh, wow.
If you don't like vinegar,
you're definitely not
gonna enjoy drinking
this, but I kinda like it.
It's kind of like a savory drink.
It's like kombucha with a mix of kimchi.
I don't know, I think it's good.
This is one of the earth's
oldest home remedies,
so there are so many
things that it benefits.
I was reading this list, and it was like,
it regulates your pH levels,
it lowers your blood pressure,
it helps you lose weight,
clears up your skin,
supposed to prevent wrinkles,
so it just seems like a magic product,
and honestly, I can't claim
that I see so much difference
because it's only been a month,
but I'm gonna continue drinking this,
and we'll see and reassess after a year
to see if it's done anything.
As much as I love routine,
my gym regimen has been
kind of monotonous because I
go four to five times a week,
and sometimes, I just don't
want to do the same thing,
so I recently signed up for ClassPass.
I've been doing it this entire month,
and it's been amazing.
If you don't know what ClassPass is,
it's a website and app
that helps you search
and find workout classes.
When you sign up, you
put your location in,
and it'll find all the workout
classes that are around you,
so whether you like TRX,
hit training, pilates, yoga,
it has everything, so you get to just
pick your classes that you want to go to.
For my plan, I pay 60 bucks
for five classes a month.
There are different plans you can do
in case you want to go more
or you want to go less,
but for me, five is good for now.
I might bump it up to 10 classes
because I'm enjoying this a lot more
because I feel like it
really switches things up,
and it's exciting to go,
especially with a partner.
Me and Amy have been really
on it with our ClassPass.
So far, we've done kickboxing,
a bunch of high interval
intensity training.
Yeah, basically, we've
done a lot of classes,
and it's a really great
way to bond with someone
because there's nothing like
sweating next to your friend,
and dying, and then getting lunch after.
My last favorite is super random,
but I had to talk about it because
I've just been really enjoying it.
It is my new Cheeki treat jar.
This was a gift from my mother-in-law,
A.K.A. Ben's mom, A.K.A. mum.
I never called my mom mom.
She was always Umma to me, so I feel like
the title mum is still,
like, up for grabs,
so I'm gonna try that out, you know.
It's very, very detailed.
Even the ears are in this cute
beige color that Cheeki has,
and it's just, I don't know,
it just makes me so happy,
and it makes Cheeki
happy when I reach for it
because she knows that,
inside, I got all her treats.
She was actually confused why
I was carrying the treat
jar into the office,
but yeah, it's been nice.
I feel like every pet owner should have
a little jar in the form of their pet
because it's just cute.
Like, where else are you
gonna put your treats?
All right, guys, that is
a wrap on my favorites.
Before I left, I wanted
to quickly thank everybody
that's helped translate my videos.
Seriously, I know it
is very time-consuming,
but it is being appreciated so hard by me,
and I want to specifically thank those
who have been translating
my videos into Korean
because, now, my mom can
finally watch my videos
and understand what I say,
because me and my mom have
a really close relationship,
but sometimes, that language
barrier is so intense,
and we find a way to communicate,
but if she watches my videos,
she has no idea what I'm saying because
I'm talking in English so quickly.
Now she can read the Korean captions,
and I don't know, watch my favorites,
and see what I'm up to, and it just means
the absolute world to me.
Thank you to everyone who has translated
in Chinese, Italian, German, Arabic.
There's been so many volunteers
that have helped me do that,
so I want to thank you guys so much.
It is not being not appreciated,
and I'm so grateful.
As usual, I would love to know
what your guys's favorites are
in the comments down below.
I just love hearing what
you guys have to say,
and what you guys are up to.
I feel like this is a good
thing we've got going on.
Anyway, I hope you guys have
a really beautiful rest of your day,
and I'll see you guys in the next one.
Bye.
Mwah.
