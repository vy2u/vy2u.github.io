pick up the camera and do a weekly vlog
because this week is actually pretty
exciting so a lot of events coming up
tomorrow have a photoshoot with local
wolves Thursday we have been spurred a
Friday we have the 1975 concert and
Saturday we have like some sort of
champagne event so I don't know I
thought I would film that I am just
filming the entire day
three hours later this is the state of
the office so this is one of the
Halloween looks that I did I actually
filmed two today got one cute one and
one kind of creepy one all right so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take photos with this makeup and then
take it all off and then apply my normal
makeup so I can film my Q&amp;amp;A
Oh
come on guys it is a gloomy Tuesday
today I have a shoot with local wolves
and my friend Randy is the photographer
Randy and I have always been wanting to
shoot and we thought that this would be
the perfect time also I'm trying to say
yes to a lot more things because I saw
this quote that said people should say
no more often and I was like yeah okay
I'll start saying no and I got a little
carried away without saying no left and
right and so now we're trying to say yes
to some more things as I yeah I'm just
trying to find a balance all right
you've got the whole crew here I'm my
first look check it out it's very like
millennium if you will like the layering

his English friends wishing him happy

friends as well because I just thought

video but with the twist and it's going
down pretty well but I think a lot of
the people that are like really into
milk bombs are really confused because

food in my mouth you're more than
welcome to watch it here also the dog
trainer is coming in at 2:30 her name is
Sam and she works at like Tully's
training services something like that we
found it on Yelp we met her for the
first time last week but that was more
of just like an introduction her getting
to know us and cheeky and vice-versa
but today is like the official training
session so I'm really excited to see
what she can teach us and cheeky

haircut so I'm quickly putting together
