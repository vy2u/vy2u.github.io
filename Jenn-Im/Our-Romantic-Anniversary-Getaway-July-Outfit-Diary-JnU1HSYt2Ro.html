my god a holy spot to know if you can
see but that is the exterminators if you
live in a house then I'm pretty sure
that everyone paid you little bit during
the summer but this heat has been
attracting the ants the spiders stay
insects all into our home and I don't
really have like a terrible fear of
insects but when I found ants in the bed
I knew that it was just time to call
professionals because that raid wasn't
really working so luckily my friend

late start to the vlog today just went
to a meeting all the way in Century City
to that ate up a good three and a half
hours of my day but after came back and
I filmed four outfits for what would
Jenna where I had a total of six outfits
and Ben and I thought it would be you
know good to just take some shots around
the neighborhood while changing in the
car but my god it was so hot like it was
such a struggle putting on and off the
clothes like a judge and everything just
wanted to stick and it was pretty funny
because prior to this day I was just
talking to Ben like man this heat wave
is awesome I love the heat bubble but I
guess it turns out I just love the heat
wave because I was in a sea most of the
time but today put me in my place the
heat wave is very real but yeah I'm
really happy that we finished the outfit
that's a huge load off my back because
we are heading to the Hamptons on
Thursday night I'm going with rebel I'm
so excited for that trip I can't believe
it's already been a year since the last
one but yes she'd be a lot of fun but I
just want to make sure that I would have
all my work done before also I've been
kind of playing around with this makeup
right over here
I saw Perry PI rocks this look on her
it's a story and I had to recreate it
and so this was my best attempt it's
like violet eye shadow and then blended
out with some orange I think I might go
tutorial on this pretty soon so I've
just been practicing the way this looks
oh my gosh look at this beautiful sunset
behind me
I love lens flares they're so beautiful
it is later in the evening and I'm on my
way to pick up Whaley we're going to
have vegan sushi I'm very excited to see
what that entails I'm assuming they're
going to go out the vegetables inside
the series are a private yoga
yeah I forget reason series yeah it's
all vegan
everyone it is Wednesday
I am currently on the road driving to
the Roosevelt Hotel hourglass is having
an event there I'm not sure what they're
promoting but I'm excited because I
really another highlighters and their
blushes I am driving because I'm
actually just trying to take a little
break from uber I mean I do like uber
and lyft but there's just something
really nice about just being in your own
car being in your own space and it also
kind of saved money because those ubers
definitely add up for any updates oh God
no the Sun is just gnarly
so last night was a little bit of a fail
at blogging I went into the hotel and I
just got completely overstimulated I
never got to or it's all betting forget
to film it's just there's just a lot of
stuff happening like we're seeing people
there's like stuff being passed around
like food and it's just hard to to
really capture everything so low
but yeah I just wanted to show you guys
what they were actually promoting it is
and they are promoting their new
refillable lipstick they provided all
the colors and I am so excited so the
cool thing is that all these little
sticks go inside this gold tube here and
you're able to just kind of pop it in
your bag or whatever so I still have yet
to try it but I'll let you guys know
what I think also here's some photos
from last night is me and Ashley getting
busted and here are the fingerprints of
all the different colors or I guess just
ten of them but yeah I just wanted to
come in and just sign off for this part
of the vlog today I am just running
around I feel great because I've got
fresh air this is like the best feeling
ever but Ben and I are going to New York
tonight our flight is at 11:50 p.m. so
it's got all the air to pack and just
get the whole house situated I believe
my brother and my friend Danny are going
to take turns
cos fitting our place so I want to thank
you guys so much for watching and I'll
see you guys in the next one bye
