because of this killer white shredded
turtleneck it has all these amazing
distressed rips all over the edge so it
ends up looking really cool and casual
for my bottoms I styled these really
sweet frilly shorts underneath which I
think contrasts really well and for my
shoes
I just went all out with my suede thigh
high boots I think these are by far my
favorite boots to rock during the fall
Tuesday is definitely my least favorite
day of the week
I mean Monday has the novelty of being
fresh new but Tuesday just reminds me
that the week is so far from being over
I wore the top with some plain black
skinny jeans because they're an item
that really complement everything I
slipped into these cute heeled sandals
because it's freaking hot and my feet
need to breathe Wacky Wednesday was my
favorite dr. Seuss book growing up
because of all the little weird things
in the illustrations something in the
photo was always a bit strange and made
you do a double-take and this outfit
kind of leans on the oddities in the
fashion realm so that's why I created it
Thursday is a new Friday haven't heard a
lot of people end up going out on
Thursday including myself because it's
pretty much nearing the weekend and it's
when bars and restaurants aren't as
crowded as a Friday or Saturday this is
an outfit that I wore to a fun and rowdy
Music Festival and it was super hot that
day definitely over 100 degrees
Fahrenheit which explains the summer
esque clothing
it's day been waiting for Friday it's a
time to let your hair down and relax or
party basically it's time for you to do
whatever you want you deserve it for
this outfit I styled my entire look
around this amazing vintage jacket from
young hungry free you have a collection
where they find vintage denim jackets
and customize it with cool patches and
graphics all over the arms in the back
it was really tempting to wear the white
on white with this outfit but I decided
to break it up with this mesh skirt and
I think it looks amazing because the
white layered underneath the fabric
peeps through so it still looks very
cohesive and cool those are all my
outfits open description box if you are
looking for the links for any of the
pieces that I featured and it would be
awesome if you can comment down which
outfit that you would Rock and if you
