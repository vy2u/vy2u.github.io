rough morning first off I completely
ripped off half my nail it just kind of
sucks because today I'm doing a shoot
from a jury so I'm gonna be modeling my
jewelry so it's just going to be hiding
this pinky most of the time and I think
I just woke up on the wrong side of the
bed
I think I'm just feeling really
overwhelmed since I bought back from New
York I feel like I have so much work to
catch up on so I just feel extremely
behind because I work yesterday and
because I'm working today I'm not gonna
feel too bad tomorrow that's the bright
news but I keep telling this coffee I
try to perk up because life's so much
harder when you have a bad attitude as
on wings all right here we are in Irvine
this is a little makeshift studio here
I'm just going to take a couple of
photos of the jewelry pebbles
Alex
it is Monday even though it feels like
Wednesday because it's just been
non-stop since I've been back last night
house with shabu shabu was amazing I
would drive out to Irvine just for that
Sh I wish I would place and I want to
thank all the girls are working there
you guys are so sweet so now I'm just
gonna get freshened up so I can get the
last clips of my bloated day outfits
video we're gonna film that Whole Foods
and then just have lunch there and while
we're at it we are outside Whole Foods I
just got a big plate of missus random
stuff hodgepodge just everything I like
in one big well it's hot it's just
everything he does everything I'm just
gonna make up my mind so we just got our
last steps for my food baby outfit and
now we're about to have some lunch back
on the road lunch at Whole Foods was
amazing I love their thoughtful section
it is the bomb um and then after I went
home and I just opened my inbox and it
was just a mess
like it is every Monday morning right
now I'm juggling three projects so my
brain is just kind of splintered
everything is just kind of in the works
so that's why it seems a lot harder than
it is but I know once I establish like
my due dates and all that stuff I'm
going to feel a lot better
it's just when the project is just in
theory that's when I'm the most stressed
out because I everything just feels like
all over the place I mean if I can
handle school where you're at where a
student's supposed to do four to five
subjects per semester or quarter I'm
sure I could handle three different
projects
feel like I need to calm the down
and realize that I can do it this is me
giving myself a pep talk I'm on my way
to go to Anneliese to get my hair done
I'm just gonna get my base so just a
little root touch-up because there's
like a big strip of black uh it's crazy
how fast hair grows oh good so angelic
what are you doing there little Thor
based on we're using the Dyson dryer you
wanna know yeah all right guys this is
very dish look I love it and we did the
nude ice and dryer it's my actual
actually Mike there's how I'm using it
and I look at you it's very powerful
that small things I guess nozzle it's
crazy yeah but y'all really having my
hair yeah thank you thanks Anna love you
the holidays are coming up and you know
what that means
food delicious food everywhere
dinnertime Japanese Tori made a
delicious Japanese great having it with
kimchi
good night goes Bo yeah it's perfect
Perry no shove a spice to be a Perry
yeah good morning
it is Tuesday feeling pretty good
because last night I upload my bloated
day's outfit video feel free to click
here right here to watch it and by the
way I'm not using annotations anymore
because YouTube is phasing it out we're
using this feature called cards now so
on the corner of the screen you're going
to see a little eye and you can click on
the eye and then it's just going to have
all the videos laid out for you and you
can use this on any mobile device on
your laptop so it's just a better
feature but it's just a little different
today is gonna be another day of
shooting filming all that goodness I am
shooting for my mature a jewelry
collection video so I don't know how
much footage I'm going to get of that
because I'm just going to be out and
about shooting that and then Stephanie's
gonna come over for hours of you shoot
and I think we're just
do that by the pool so yeah just go
knock those out and then I'm having
dinner with Stephanie after all right
just finished my facebook live everyone
thank you so much for joining
mm-hmm Bakeman I had such an amazing
time on Facebook live with you guys I'm
going to try and do this at least once
but you know the time has come
by the way they change the dressing back
to the original one so I'm happy
update Aaron solid was not up to my
standards
orange was sour Leafs were kind of wilty
and the original address say that the
came back is not good as the second
dressing that they came back with so a
little disappointed but life goes on yay
Ben brought a snack back from Starbucks
these delicious dough balls are called
bun Tom's
we discovered them yesterday after we
saw them on Shark Tank and we saw that
they sell at Starbucks and we've become
obsessed very good they're very
delicious
so this one is that everything with
cream cheese this is the original of
cream cheese complete this is French
toast there's some kind of buttery maple
syrup or something on up afterwards for
this oh good idea good idea I love how I
was like oh
grab some for Stephanie but I don't
think there is gonna be Mila mm-hmm
mm desert so we got to look this is a
red velvet dingdong covered in chocolate
with a strawberry chocolate and
strawberry ice cream and then this one
is the pumpkin butter cake with a
crumble topping there you go
oh my gosh little sister was amazing I
highly highly recommend that restaurant
I've been there a total of three times
now and literally their meals do not
disappoint get everything we ordered so
I don't know I'm pretty sure I labeled
all the foods so definitely get that but
now it is 10 o'clock I have been just
working for the past four hours there is
a lot of prep that needs to be done for
