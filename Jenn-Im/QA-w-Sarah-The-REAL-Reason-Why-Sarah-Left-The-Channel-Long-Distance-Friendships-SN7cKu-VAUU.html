I'm Sara and today's video is an update
about Sara for those who don't know who
she is she is one of my oldest and
dearest friends and she is so much
harder to travel with back in 2010 right
yeah look cute during the summer 2010
and of course we decided to film on the
worst day possible we're both very ill
yeah so we're doing a Q&amp;amp;A I asked you
guys on Twitter what questions you like
to ask us so let's start the show
pretty much right the first question is
from David yes Sara where have you been
I watched the channel in December 2011
and from then I focused all of my
attention and energy on mechanical
engineering then I transferred to San
Jose State and I'm going to get my
degree this may actually yeah it's just
so crazy because we literally switch
spots from Allen up north and she was in
SoCal and then when I graduate she
transferred and then it just kind of
flip flopped the second question is from
Andrea who asks what was your main goal
or reason for starting the channel and
love you so much let me - I guess we
originally started the channel we were
both in Community College I was watching
a lot of YouTube Beauty videos and I was
like signing in to you and I just
noticed that there was this huge pool in
the fashion realm and I was like hey
maybe that could be what we bring to the
table Jenna thought there were other
girls that would have similar interests
that would want to see their clothes
represented online no and then she
graciously let me hello well I mean it's
pretty scary putting yourself out there
online I wouldn't have been able to do
without you because it would be so
awkward be like hey mom can you feel me
did you know it was just like a really
fun product I didn't know between us do
it a lot of creative trust you really
need to be able to say like I want to do
this things that's dumb or no yeah and I
never was you know we never put each
other down on ideas hmm so I think that
was really good chemistry
Arie asks us what made Cara want to stop
filming YouTube videos for clothes
counters love you both since restricting
halls so there are three actual reasons
for why I stopped the first one is the
official reason we put in our goodbyes
Sarah video parents goodbye now what
when Jen was going to transfer to UC
Davis so the logistics of us building
together was nil we would rather spend
the time we had together when actually
hanging out being friends not having
these assignments and projects that we
had to do filming videos took a big
chunk at a time and when you're forcing
something it really strips away the fun
out of it the second reason was frankly
I was kind of losing this was just for
me I don't know how Jen feels about
obviously like fashion for you is
something different than it is for me
but at that point in the channel clothes
kind of felt like an assignment for me I
would go into stores and look at things
based on whether they fit a criteria not
whether I actually liked them I was like
what am i doing this when I don't have
joy in it and that was something that
you had to help me realize you do you
even want to do this anymore
and we to take a step back and that's
who we made the gazai video and that was
a really crazy competition I remember it
happening because we were filming like
our maze despite remember it remember
yeah we're like Church trans or
something yeah would you treasure
something I remember when she came over
it looked like the nautical rough night
and I almost felt bad like I think I was
like 14 you do this you know and yeah
but at the same time you were putting
110% and I was like maybe 30% they have
one be honest and it sucks because we
care about each other so much and you
are going through some crazy and I
guess that leads you to the third yeah
you know and the third point is I'm not
to go too much into it but my dad passed
away in May of 2011 and I basically was
in depression for one to two years the
channel wouldn't be alive it wasn't for
her stepping up in those those months I
couldn't bring myself to talk about
clothes or anything I get this why we're
doing this video now five years later
because like all of that really settles
and like Jen kept it on you low down for
you guys like you know I mean like oh
the bad guys my house why she's not here
to say and I think it is important that
this update because now it's crazy that
we can sit down and we can talk about it
but literally that was a really hard
time for you it was just a rough couple
of years like a year year and a half
yeah and on a on a lighter note oMG I
miss y'all how would you say your style
has changed over the years I feel like
my style in general has just remained
all over the place with the biggest
lesson that I learned is to just dress
through my body types I feel like before
if I like something I wouldn't care
about the size or the proportioning
being oh I'll just wear it like good I
wear something to stand out for my body
but I feel like now I know what looks
best on my short petite frame fit it's
super important for me now and I just
feel like that changes the game for
everything because if something does
they fit you right it doesn't matter
what kind of smell you have it just
looks kind of off that's the hard lesson
to learn from our goodwill days I know
this right well from our early 20s we
were experimenting with really crazy
things because that's what you do when
you're young you're like I don't know if
I like this but I'm going to wear it for
a day and we'll find out Fionna and um
now that we're mid late 20s oh I know
right
ah we still her mid 20s yes you kind of
I guess level off you get like you know
what fits you you know the styles you
like for me I kind of have gravitated
towards more um I guess like clean-cut
monochrome yeah not so much graphic
stuff we go on I can't see you in a
graphics anymore about today all my high
school days I guess classical art
classes
Wow yeah but I mean there's always a
time place to be gaudy for gaudy things
oh yeah definitely jewels everywhere
have - yeah - next up we've got Jackie
she asks what's the first thing you guys
do when you guys finally nice huh good
eat yeah that's what you want to do that
we did that more than 26 or 27
yeah number like the first time we met
this great creative holiday break in the
hub and then we eat and if sometimes you
have a little drink new question what
did you love about working together and
making fashion videos and what do you
admire about each other style hmm well I
loved about it is that we got to create
a tangible product and it was it was all
a creative tangible product and
especially right now I'm doing a lot of
hard science so that outlet of kind of
different colors and seeing where things
go
it's really cathartic and I think it's
really healthy to do and I really liked
our stop-motion that we used to do our
intro oh my god is so good like for our
first video in a summer fashion of a
highly ambitious I know we got all our
shoes and Bryant and our Korean hood
yeah could you just watch the roundtable
help I know and like not that long that
per shot it was my neighbor's house that
I never talked to but we just used their
I guess like that front grid say yeah
yeah and we're just like I hope it'll
come out with six we this perspective
growing up we always loved planning
things some even like imaginary things
yeah so it was like really fun to the
plant something and then execute it and
then share it with the world it was so
fun like reading the comments and liking
it grow because it was such like the
YouTube community was so different back
then I felt like it was definitely a lot
more like intimate and it made I
definitely oh and then what do you
admire about each other's personal scale
ah I think for serious personal style I
want to say that you have always done
you which I appreciate like I mean I
don't get really easy to get caught up
in all like the fat fashion trends and
everything like I feel like you are not
influenced by that I just like for your
style would describe it as like modern
but with quirky little details like this
necklace or like your purse with like
the little rainbow M&amp;amp;Ms II mean I think
it's cool I feel like I kind of an
opposite appreciation for you where it's
like I'm kind of more of the effect well
you can you can feel such a broad range
of style that you can actually embody
and feel comfortable in
and I think that like I you know from
why I left I had like fashion fatigue oh
no oh oh oh Becca I experienced fashion
city giggling after a year of doing
Close Encounters and you're still
gunning it you know you're still finding
joy and passion and creativity and
thinking a combination still and like I
couldn't do that and also you have like
a really courageous shoe stylist and I'm
not saying like oh like left brain is
patty but I mean like seriously like you
wear shoes that I'm afraid to wear
because of my ankle I know you'll be
capable yeah Axl Rose you put all these
shoes any kind like flat chunky heels
like platforms whatever and you make it
work with your outfit and you like just
struck down the street like single year
yeah I don't know I think that's really
awesome oh thank you oh you know those
who don't actually hold each other I
know this is good to let it out yeah
question number seven comes from Bailey
and she asks what was the most difficult
thing about keeping a long-distance
friendship and how did you get through
it
technically we're still going through a
long-distance 40l in the beginning
honestly
it was pretty difficult for me because I
see you like every day yeah so long and
then all of a sudden I was like I bring
it up here and it just it's just like
not seeing as often was really tough on
me as the years went on I just got used
to the frequency or I guess lack of
frequency when you guys see each other
it's about putting everything aside and
just catching up and seeing that as a
victory as opposed to being like why
won't you hear from me when I did those
alone you know it's it's not about that
it's about like caring for the person
and I genuinely wanted to know like what
you've been up to
yeah it's mainly about timing at times
to this person and sometimes that's not
the case for either of us like whatever
our schedule and yet just I care about
what's in your life I care about who
your story's about these people I have
no idea what they even look like but I
want to know because it's part of you
and it's stuck in you and if you find
someone that you feel that way about
then
mattered if you haven't seen each other
for a day or for a year if you'll still
have that connection I'm asking my own
question
would you ever make your own YouTube
channel and no big discussion a lot of
my movies so quite so sir to answer just
like I could not affect you having your
new details no okay yeah so how I see
YouTube channels are you need a certain
level of dedication and energy and
passion for it which I don't have
oh you need a certain personality an
aesthetic eye and a certain type of
charisma
I do have charisma visa but not the
crisis you have and different it's
different yes yeah I think that you
wanted a million we are really different
people we're really really different and
so in our channel and in our friendship
we're complementary but identical we're
happy with how things have progressed
yeah we both found our passion
and that's a big conflict with each
other no not at all yeah so cool so I
think we're both really content with
where we are all right number 9 what is
your favorite memory together oh my god
this one oh so hard I couldn't think of
one specific memory like eating hot
cheetos in the way like on July 8th
that's that I don't I can't think of
singing that way with you because we had
no too many memories including known
each other since elementary school
that's how long it's big if you could
talk about favorite instances like just
kind of just pocket of time in middle
school I remember we would always walk
home and we would sit on the bench and
then we would fit all the day weird and
not go home and we just talk like twice
a collar ever we've scraped graffiti
also some things happen but thank you
more like huge
we like to drop it off with like our
nails I thought about some funny weird
things we did while filming I remember I
would be in your living room like just
laying close out on the floor would you
be in your room putting your makeup on
and you like
for like a minute you came I thought
that you would say something or be
annoyed and quit let you do things I
think I remember like getting creepier
you thought that there would be a
breaking point where I'm like what but
there wasn't
seems like a filming in 95 degree
weather or at home elements we were
doing fall fashion trends and we're like
like clear when you look back on your
older videos
what would you both say or what advice
would you give to the younger generation
for my younger self I would tell her to
not feel so stressed about not knowing
enough I feel like when I was younger I
always felt so behind I didn't know I
would just tell myself like you didn't
know anything because you were young
like a corking annoy saying it to serve
them somewhere and I would just tell
myself to to just like stay curious
but still be confident because there's
nothing wrong with not knowing anything
you know that's like that's why you're
here to ask questions and you're there
to absorb and I would tell her that you
will grow into your your skin and you
will be happy so we're talking about
just our personal life not just about
videos right oh yeah yeah so for videos
I would tell myself could wear better
quality shoes
ah because must be are destroyed I think
you look like my ankle sucks and you've
always thought that wasn't really worth
it wearing hockey shoes like skin so
good quality shoes and I guess your life
just appreciate everything you woke it
co-factors like my dad has to be like
appreciated we love but really
appreciate what you have your friends
your family yeah take account for all
your relationships and appreciate them
and let me speak also don't be too
accommodating you really want to think
about yourself do it's not selfish to do
that alright guys that wraps up the Q&amp;amp;A
with Dara I would tell you guys to
follow Sarah but she has my social media
accounts so you don't know why you'll
ever see her again
and I just want to thank all you guys
did still remember me yeah I don't know
it's really sweet and it gives me a lot
of pride and I'm really happy that I was
able to call your lives for a time and
that I would be able to help Jen fill
the channel into what it is today could
they learn have been the same without
you you probably want to be here without
you yeah wouldn't it oh I guess it's
trembles accounts but it's a different
channel now yeah oh because it is just
easier we've been doing a quick voice
for such a long time guys and pretty
shirt stuck in the middle poison yeah a
recent thing I don't know who we're
impersonating either so thank you so
much for watching guys and I'll see you
guys when I sign
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
