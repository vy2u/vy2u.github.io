back today I'll be recreating art pieces
into outfits I have always been a huge
lover and appreciator of the Arts though
I thought it would be really fun to
bring these historic images in to
realize all of the artwork or art pieces
that I recreating our twitter submission
to muse i so thank you to everyone that
sent me these images I feel like a lot
of new artists were showing on my radar
so thank you so much I before I get
started I must ask if you're subscribed
because if you're not the buttons down
below hit that become a gem today and
let's get started with the video so my
first art piece is women and goals by
Gustav Klimt like this is just like one
immaculate portrait like if I could go
back in time and get my portrait done by
an artist it would definitely be him
because his work is like nothing I've
ever seen before
like I just appreciate how ornate and
details all his portraits are and I love
like they used some like pieces of gold
and like the collage eNOS I'm pretty
sure the portrait would be freaking
expensive but definitely worth it to
have a portrait done by him this is how
I recreated that look I just wore this
gold sequin gown I found this on Amazon
and I tried my best to find a dress that
has like different metallic patterns but
I failed and I thought that this school
just would do I added this crystal
choker to match the one that she has on
in reality I would probably wear this to
like a dinner or a premiere or something
it's definitely like a lot fancier that
I'm used to there's also a film based
off the women in this portrait
apparently the Nazis like like stole
this in a raid so there's like a whole
film on that and believe it's called
like women and gold I haven't seen it
but I just you know random fact that I
found online
the next piece I have is called dancers
in pink by Edgar Degas this was painted
in the 1800s and it's considered kind of
the Impressionist era so that's why
there's just like a lot of thin light
brushstrokes that's just classic to that
style and Degas is actually known to
have painted a lot of paintings of
ballerinas and dance
are they performing or they're resting
so just kind of like a little like peek
inside of ballerinas life and this
painting in particular just like caught
my eye I think it's just like the splash
of color and it just looks very candid
now this is how I recreated this look I
couldn't find a pink tutu or a bodysuit
so I thought that red would be my best
option honestly I think like red and
pink are pretty interchangeable I did a
fake growth into my hair to match the
one that the girl has on and then wore
this black choker from aria my to match
this painting I feel like this outfit
can really only be worn like if you're a
dancer or ballerina or maybe like a
Halloween costume it's definitely not
something that I would wear everyday
maybe if I just threw on like blue jeans
instead of the red to to just be more
every day
our next art piece is by jean-claude
Auguste Dominique Ingres and is of a
woman named Mademoiselle Caroline Rozier
I'm sorry like I'm horrible with French
and obviously I'm like butchering the
pronunciation so forgive me in advance
I'm so sorry this was painted in 1806
and it's the third of three portraits of
the river II a family this is actually
hanging at the Louvre in Paris so I
thought that was pretty damn cool I
really love the way her eyes were
painted here and kind of lowered and
they have like that slight smirk very
similar to Mona Lisa's voila here is
Mademoiselle Caroline in the flesh I'm
wearing a white empire waist dress with
lace sleeves it's long and flowy and I
definitely felt like it disney princess
in this for accessories I wore these
yellow gloves and his faux fur stole
that I borrowed from my hair I did a
center part and pulled it back to copy
what she did and let me tell you when I
was filming this it was so freaking hot
I was dying and I definitely got a lot
of interesting stares for this we filmed
this at Terranea and we thought it would
be like the perfect backdrop because
that like beach and the cliff and it was
so funny because I think people
legitimately thought that this was my
wedding dress because like Ben and I
were like walking around taking photos
of it so yeah I mean it's like it's a
good thing that my wedding dress doesn't
actually look like that or I don't have
what a dress but it wouldn't look like
that regardless we got the shot and
that's all that matters
this next one is pretty hilarious this
is by the brothers
and Kubrick's van yet and this
particular panel is actually one segment
of this entire altarpiece this was
painted in 1432 and it's considered one
of the world's treasures I know that
these men just look like they're like
constipated and confused but they're
actually singing
they're singing angels and they're all
in the choir and I decided to dress up
as one of the angels I'm wearing a red
silk robe and I thought that this would
just give the same vibe as the ones that
they were wearing and then I threw on
this tapestry scarf that I got at this
ministry website and it was actually
like pretty expensive I paid $60 for
this but I had to get it or else it just
wouldn't complete the look I topped it
off with a bejeweled crown from a party
website and I called it a day this art
piece is actually one of the most stolen
art pieces of all time the Nazis were
like desperate to steal it and actually
one of the panels is still missing so I
thought that was super interesting I
really enjoy like researching all these
art pieces it was kind of like being an
art history class but without being
creative so pretty awesome regardless
this is one of the world's most just
like influential paintings ever because
I think I was like the world first oil
painting like first oil painting
masterpiece and it also has like very
heavy solid roots this last art piece is
one of my favorites it's by Frida Kahlo
and she's just one of my favorite
artists of all time
her story's always been so fascinating
to me because she's just endured so much
in her life like for example when she
was a child she contracted polio and
then growing up a car hit her and she
became disabled and during her recovery
is when she really began to paint this
was painted in 1940 and she just looks
really tense because she's lived a life
of physical and emotional pain
unfortunately the man that she married
Diego Rivera wasn't very liked wasn't a
very good match for her he was always
cheating on her and didn't treat her
right like even cheated on her with her
sister so the story is just very wild
and she's just seen a lot of stuff so
I'm saying to talk about her all day but
here is how I recreated this look I put
my hair up and added this flower crown
in plastic for your style I haven't had
a
little unibrow to honor her I threw on
this brown tie-dye shawl that mirrored
her top and then underneath I wore this
new skirt from American Apparel for
accessories I wore the silver choker
that kind of looks like the thorn one
she's wearing and then I wore this palm
tree earring because I couldn't find a
hand and I thought that it would do Rita
is one of my favorite artists of all
time because she's very introspective
with the work and I could just I don't
know I feel like I can relate to her a
lot and I just feel like a lot of her
portraits like show how someone can feel
so trapped in their mind in their body
and I just have so much respect for her
all right everybody those were all the
outfits that I have for you I am so
sorry that it took me like forever to
film this it's because I had a source
all the clothing find all the
backgrounds and like just research about
all these art pieces so yeah that's why
I took a little bit longer than usual I
want to thank you guys so much for
watching if you enjoyed the segment
please hit the like button write it in
the comments down below you want me to
do like a part to let me know I would
appreciate your feedback if you would
like to submit one of your favorite art
pieces that you'd like me to recreate
into an outfit I'll feel free to write
it in the comments down below or tweet
me at I'm genom whatever you prefer
honestly I had so much fun filming this
and it kind of inspired me to start
painting again because growing up I
loved to paint because I was never a
good writer so I always found like
different mediums to express myself so
whether that was painting or videos I'm
just really visual I want to thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see
you guys in the next one bye
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
