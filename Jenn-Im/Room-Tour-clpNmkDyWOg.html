a room tour video and I'm sorry for
logging but I knew I'd film it today
because in living town and we can have
to go back to LA I'm really excited
about that and you had a phone before I
packed because otherwise this place
would look like a giant crap storm I
wouldn't be able to film until August so
today it is I'm gonna be taking you
around the nooks and crannies in my room
so let's do it
so this is the corner of my room that
you guys never get to see over here we
have my bed I thought this bed was
perfect because it's very minimal and
it's white and I really like the sheets
because I always wanted something like
really floral and really cute and dainty
I thought it would really work well with
the wallpaper the Mummy's name is Z and
Z is the genderless pronoun because I
can't decide whether Z would be a he or
she
so it became a Z I got this bed frame
and I got it at the community to store
it in woodlands and it was four dollars
my only concern was I was scared that I
would have bedbugs in it and so
basically I just shook the bed frame
outside of the store as far as I could
and although it's probably not the most
efficient way to get rid of bed bugs
pretty sure if there were bed bugs
they'd be here now but luckily there
weren't any bed bugs so my room is
bedbug free I just attached a little
dreamcatcher on it even though pretty
sure it's broken because I still have
nightmares sometimes and I got to have
an urban forestry class and it was just
on a pile of things that said free stuff
so I took it in this corner I have some
artwork that I did and it's a fresh man
T mouth and he's like basically yelling
at some kids off his front lawn so he's
just saying soldering kids and the next
one is called revenge
it's basically Little Red Riding just
tearing yourself out of the wolf's belly
and so it's just a red hand it's all
pissed off I have my favorite lamp from
Ikea whoa big surprise basically just
put on top of my beautiful I have a
little hamsa hand jewelry stand
I just put three of my favorite earrings
I feel at the moment and I got that at
the world market and I didn't know they
sold little housing knickknacks there
but they do kind of arrange some black
and white candles around it and these
white candles they birth with 24 hours
because they're Hanukkah candles over
here we have my slippers that I don't
use anymore and they're on top of these
Jeffrey Campbell boxes because I think
I'm kind of a hoarder and so I can't
really get rid of them I have a cute
little Yeti man and when boyfriend got
for me because he knows how much I like
beards okay so this is where I do my
homework where I edit where I study
where I read sometimes and this is my
desk and guess what the desk is also
from Ikea decorated it with some
photobooth pictures my mom my dad
friends I some cards that are really
cute a notepad that Sarah gave me from
my could buy package to do lists of
random things I need to do I have and
this is probably one my favorite
photographs it's by Berg reach and he
basically just got a bunch of his cool
surrealist artists friends and made them
close his eyes and they love dreaming of
a naked woman and if you see dollies on
here one of my favorite things my room
is Maya Chopin bust and I got it at
Goodwill and it came with my vogner bust
he's not one of my favorite composers um
I mean I couldn't just leave these busts
at Goodwill so I got them both it's a
lamp Lantern and I got it from a thrift
store as well and it was three dollars
that I thought looked cool cuz it
matched my wallpaper on here I have my
eye eye home but I don't have an iPod
because I washed my pot in the wash so
it's dead so now it plays nothing it's
just a nice clock now and it's on top of
1q84 and a book that I read from my
photography and history class that I
just kept because the textbook people
wouldn't buy it back so now it became a
prompt up here I have a world map and
it's a scratch-off map and you get to
just basically scratch off all the
countries that you've been to and as you
can see I I haven't been to
a lot of countries but I know once I go
to Antarctica it's gonna just kind of
you know balance everything out it's
gonna make it look like I went to a lot
more countries and continents so so far
I've been to the United States of
America because I live here and I went
to Chile because my grandparents lived
there for a bit my sort that's where my
brother was born so I went there when I
was a kid I went to Germany I've been to
Netherlands I've been to the United
Kingdom and Korea whoo
right behind me is my bookcase that I
got at the Container Store and it's I
think everyone's xena it's like the
leaning bookcase so on the top shelf I
was able to bring some books back from
home these are the books that I hand
picked out to bring because I didn't
want to bring all my books from home
because that'd have been just a lot of
dead weight you know and I did I knew it
I wasn't gonna have a lot of space the
second shelf is filled with my
housemates books that she wanted me to
kind of store because she had no space
and I gladly took them because they look
really nice and plus I need to read some
of those books over the summer because I
want I want to get more into classic
literature over here we have all my
sunglasses I want a better way to
arrange them but this will have to do
and over here I put all I put my
favorite nail polishes on the silver
container that I got at a thrift store
and I have my MAC lipsticks there I have
an oil burner my matchbox and I thought
was really cute because it's really
patriotic but it's really subtle I went
to a Tibetan store and I got this really
cool ohm hand and the the candle broke
off because I was really clumsy and I
chopped it an old whiskey container that
I got an a thrift store and some wine
that I opened one day and I thought that
I thought the bottle would look nice in
my room I have some postcards from Anne
Frank museum when I went in Amsterdam I
think two or three years ago I have a
skeleton key chain because it's from my
halloween costume asterix I was Kali
goddess of destruction down here this is
where I store all my makeup I put it
inside this Jeffrey Campbell box because
I don't know cat matched my lotion
bottle which I caught at Urban
Outfitters and I thought they just
really worked well together and this
Kitty is filled with CeraVe which is my
favorite face lotion I have my brushes
that are just in these little containers
that I got at the 99-cent store and
they're just kind of chillin some of
them are dirty clean that have more
containers for the night in store the
first container is filled with hair
bands all my hair material headphones
the second one is filled with just
miscellaneous nail crap and chapstick
and a sharpener I really need to
organize this I just basically got a
bunch of ink blots on the internet and I
printed them out and I just frame them
into some frames that I got at Target
and I kind of want this corner to be
this weird therapist corner so that's
why I have a chair here and so people
can just kind of talk about their
problems and kind of psycho Adalind is
ico analyze what they're thinking about
or not really I'm just focused gonna
listen my jeweler headboard is from
Sarah she got it at Goodwill long time
ago and she didn't know what to do with
it so she left it in my room and I kind
of just took it with me to Davis and
when she came by like oh this looks
really familiar and like yeah it's yours
and she end up being really happy that I
had it but anyway I divided my jewelry
into uh silvers and golds and these are
only the necklaces that I kind of reach
out for I have all my necklaces and
jewelry in a box that I don't really
wear all the time but these are the ones
I just gravitate towards most um I'm a
few exceptions like this random Tiger
that Sarah got for me for Christmas
oh look she just saw the ugliest thing
and so she gave it to me and I was
really touched because it's so ugly that
it's kind of cool this is one my
favorite necklaces this is from Burning
Man last year his old hippy lady gave it
to me and I just thought it was a really
sentimental thing because she had so
much light and love in her and I really
appreciate it
this is my nightstand I suppose or a
coffee table I don't know what this is
called I think it's : nightstand I just
have my Olga here and I like to take I'm
going to start the habit of taking
pictures of
friends in my room on my wallpaper and
eventually developing them and then
hanging them on my room as well and I
just keep all my silver jewelry in the
silver tin that I drifted and I keep my
watch there - it just keeps everything
in place I could just kind of grab and
go I have some more else's karbala
photographs here and it's all nestled
nice on top of my Vice magazine I have a
fake plant because I'm pretty sure if I
had a real plant it would die because I
- I can't be bothered to change out the
soil and water it so fake plant it is
down here I have this basket and this
basket holder that I thrifted
and here is just a bunch of my bracelets
and my umbrella and my glasses case I'm
gonna have a separate closet tour video
because I don't know I think it'd just
be really overwhelming if everything was
in here it's honestly not that big I
swear but it's quite full so we're gonna
open it on the right side I have all my
coats jackets I used on shorts terminals
that winter time but I put my pants here
now because it's really hot I will try
to keep it coordinated by color it's
yeah I keep my blocks together and my
whites of my patterns try my best but
because it keeps me organized and it
just makes creating outfits a lot easier
when everything is just
color-coordinated and I can just kind of
see what kind of color mood I'm feeling
that day this is where all my regular
clothes are just long-sleeve sweaters
short sleeves anything and also my
shorts on top I have a bit of my boots
and the bottom you don't want to see the
blonde of my closet it's just crazy
because it's just clothes though fit on
my closet anymore and I'm planning to
sell or I don't know reevaluate let them
age a bit in a bag and then rip them
open when I have nothing else to wear
and see if I like them again and so that
concludes the tour of my room I hope you
enjoyed it it's quite small but it's
jam-packed with just random things that
I think really represent me if you have
any questions you can dress them to my
Twitter which is I'm Jenna and if you
want to follow my life
on instagram my username is also I'm
Jenna well thanks so much for watching
and I will talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
