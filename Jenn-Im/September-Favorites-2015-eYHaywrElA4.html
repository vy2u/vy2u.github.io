another month has passed which means
it's time for another batch of favorites
and you guys are used to this by now so
I'm just gonna hop on to the first item
I'm gonna start this video off with a
lip product because these are just the
easiest to explain last month I have
been loving at Kat Von D's everlasting
liquid lipstick in the shade it is
amande if you couldn't tell by the name
yes it's a dark vampy shade it just
glides on like a gloss and it dries into
a beautiful matte finish and it's very
pigmented very long-lasting it's just
amazing and I can't wait to kind of
explore different shades from this line
next up I have a fashion favorite which
is my plethora backpack and I know I
have a ton of different backpacks but
none have been big enough to carry my
laptop and my other belongings so I'm
really happy that I ran across this one
when you open it you can see that there
is a compartment where you can put your
laptop in and it just kind of keeps you
extra organized because it's not gonna
kind of bleed in with all your other
belongings there's a pouch in the front
where you can put like your charger or
your pens and pencils all that goodness
and there is a slot on the side where
you can put really important items like
your phone or even a passport if you're
traveling this is just gonna be a really
great carry-on bag when I head on to
London I can't wait to use this thing
also since it's block it's just gonna
match everything and the putter just
really ties in well with fall and winter
season now I'm gonna talk about fake
flashes because I've been in a really
deep phase with them I don't know I'm
always on and off with them sometimes I
am satisfied with the way my spiky
lashes look and sometimes I just want to
feel more glam and wear false lashes and
I've tried out a lot and I finally
figured out ones that are my absolute
favorite
it's our dolls demi whispies and these
are just amazing because the band is
really thin and flexible so when you
apply them it doesn't feel like there's
something forwarding it in your eye it's
just like a nice fluttery finish and I
just don't even notice that they're on I
always buy them in a pack of four
because I run through these like water I
would say a pack
maybe last to max three times it's just
the band is so thin that it's just
difficult to clean and have it keep its
shape so I just always like to keep
these waiting on the wings if they came
in a pack of a hundred I would be
totally into that and I hope they make
them soon I found my second signature
scent last month it is Javon she's on
Jill Demond the secret totally butchered
that forgive me I first smelt this at
the airport with Stephanie well we're
duty-free shopping and we both fell in
love with it she ended up purchasing it
so I just kind of sat back and let her
you know have her time with the
fragrance but every time I would go over
to her place I would spritz it on and
she just gradually gradually stopped
using it I think she's just obsessed
with her Jo Malone English parasite and
so I thought it was time for me to just
buy my own bottle and stop nicking hers
and I just went ahead and got the small
little travel size because that way I
can just keep it in my purse and spray
it and literally every time I wear this
there's at least one person who says God
what are you wearing it smells so good
and I would say the scent is very fresh
and bright it's so difficult describing
scents you're just gonna have to smell
it for yourself at your Sephora and I
assure you you're gonna like it if you
don't you and I have really different
tastes and scents for my book favorite I
have speaker for the dead by Orson Scott
Card surprise surprise it's another
sci-fi novel and this is actually the
sequel for the Ender's Game which was in
my favorites last year and so it took me
this long to read it but I'm really
happy that I did I think this is a
really good mix of sci-fi and philosophy
so it just really tickles the brain and
I feel like the journey while reading
this is just a page-turner I couldn't
put it down this book is just the
aftermath of everything that happened
after Ender's Game and ender is getting
to know a new alien species and how two
cultures are understanding each other so
definitely give it a read I would say
read Ender's Game first so you can get
kind of like a better context of the
sequel my last favorite is a piece of
camera equipment so exciting and it is
sure's microphone and for the longest
time I
was just using the mic you know that
came with my DSLR and I thought that was
enough but after having this mic and
using it I just feel like the quality of
my videos have just shot up I feel like
when a video has good sound I think
people just tend to stick around I don't
know what do you guys think I mean this
mic first came in I was really
intimidated by it because I thought it
would be really fun bleah and you know
just cables freaked me out but dude it's
so simple you just pop it on the top and
you just put the cable into the hole
that says mic and bam you got really
good sound and I'm so excited about it
if you make youtube videos definitely
invest in this because I feel like the
sound quality is what you know makes
people stay sometimes you know okey doke
those were by September favorites
I feel like this batch of favorites
wasn't that exciting but whatever
October is a new month I am currently on
the hunt for new music new books so if
you want to comment down below please
let me know and if you are gonna
recommend me a song it would be amazing
if you could just comment down the
direct link for the song so I can just
immediately listen to it anyway I hope
you guys have a wonderful rest of your
day and thank you so much for watching
I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
