of favorites because that's what we do
here on YouTube
we like to reflect on what we liked last
month at the beginning of each month so
let's dive into my first favorite I'm
going to start off with these star
earrings if you've been watching any of
my videos in September you've seen these
guys make many appearances these are
from style nanda and they were
backordered actually when I got them
online but I waited a full month and
they finally came and they're totally
worth the wait I feel like they add that
perfect little sparkle for any outfit
like I probably would have won these
star earrings for my look today but then
I would really be decked out in star
jewelry like for example I have this
star ring from a jury this has not left
my finger since I got it so it's been
maybe three or four months someone
thought this was like an engagement ring
it's not it so I had to switch it to
this hand and it made it more casual and
then another star jewelry piece that
I've been loving has been this choker
this one is from Amarillo I feel like
it's gonna be my mission this year to
find more star jewelry in September I
found a fragrance that I've become
obsessed with this is Beach walk by
Maison Martin Margiela and this smells
absolutely divine this was actually a
gift that my friend Emily gave me for my
birthday so that was very sweet of her
it was actually a really good catch
because like every time me and Emmett go
out we would go to her house we pregame
for a little bit and before we went out
I would always ask if I can spray this
from her perfume collection and I guess
she caught on and she got it for my
birthday and so that was really sweet
that she remembered this is a really
fresh and sweet scent I am just
attracted to smells like this even
though it's supposed to be like a summer
scent I believe the websites that I had
hints of bergamont coconut and lime /
lemon oh this smells so bomb you gotta
sniff it the next time you're at a
department store so while I was vlogging
Ghent amber a lot of you guys had
questions on what equipment I use to
vlog and I thought that Stemper
favourites would be a great way to
address this question so this is what I
use to do my daily vlogs I know it's a
lot but I've come to terms that this is
my preferred setup
first off we've got the body this is the
canon t3i and this is the very first
DSLR I've ever gotten so it's been
through a lot I got this probably in
2011 so we've seen some stuff together
the game-changer is definitely the lens
it's really long so I'm just gonna pop
it on the video but this is a wide-angle
lens and this is what makes my vlogs
look like you're seeing everything
because this type of lens it lets you
see more of the environment this lens is
not good if you want like a blurry
background though that's not going to
give you that nice soft creamy
background this is just gonna show you
everything as the way it is and that's
personally the way I like my vlogs to
look like and on top of all this setup I
have this tripod this one is my
Manfrotto and it's this little baby one
this just gives you the extra height
that I need sometimes and also it makes
it easier to set up when I'm out on the
field I don't have to balance it on
anything because I've got this lovely
little tripod this setup is very extra
this is not necessary to make an amazing
wall you can use even your iphone to
make a great vlog it's really putting
your own spin to it it's a lot of the
editing it's a lot of the actual content
that you're creating if that makes sense
as opposed to the equipment that you use
so long story short that is what I use
to vlog for my movie fever I have Ghost
World and this is one of those films
that has been on my to watch list for
years and years and years it's one of
those phones that you always see on
tumblr too but at the time it wasn't on
Netflix and I don't know how to use
torrents or anything or illegally
download I just I get so scared about
all that stuff I'm still lame but anyway
this was finally on HBO go so I was like
yes this is my chance to finally watch
it and I did not regret it at all like
it's such an amazing film and no this is
not a scary film by any means if
anything it's like a dark comedy so
you're definitely gonna get some laughs
in it's about a pair of best friends
they're very cynical apathetic teenagers
who just graduated high school and this
is the summer where they're just kind of
figuring everything out and entering
adulthood hands down one of my favorite
parts of this film was the costume and
set design everything was on point like
the little details the outfits the props
the color schemes like it all just
blended in so well like it was their own
little world and I really really respect
that and I was
very very inspired I think one day I
kind of want to do like a ghost world
inspired lookbook another thing to add
to the list of things I need to do but
it left me feeling really inspired and I
think you should definitely check it out
my last favorite is not a thing but
actually my living breathing beautiful
daughter chicky hi oh she came into my
life on my birthday she was a gift from
my manager Ashley
literally I can't talk when she's here
because I just am in all of her presents
Wow Wow Ben and I have been dog sitting
for a couple of months now especially
mochi who is Ashley's Maltipoo and after
dog sitting it really really made me
want to have a little for a companion of
my own and understand that this is not
just a trend or something that I can put
away when I'm bored I understand that
this is like a 10 to 12 year commitment
like chi-chi's probably gonna meet my
kids and I have them and that is just an
insane thought to think this is my first
time having a dog so I've been doing so
much research luckily Ben has grown up
with dogs so I mean that that helps me
out a lot but all for all like the puppy
training and stuff I've been reading so
many articles watching so many YouTube
videos if you see my YouTube history
it's literally all about puppy training
but we've actually scheduled an
appointment with a dog trainer on
Thursdays so hopefully she can lead us
the correct path I just feel like chicky
has really mucked out all of my motherly
instincts she I don't know she she makes
me so incredibly happy and it's so
awesome getting to see her personality
develop every single day and I can't
wait to show you guys more of her she's
only three months old now I've heard
like the 4 to 5 month stage is when they
start teething and they get a little
like out of control it's like the
terrible twos for dogs right I'm ready
for the worst if you guys have any tips
on puppy training feel free to leave it
in the comments down below
let's get that doggy discussion going
okeydoke those are my September
favorites honestly I'm a little sad that
Jennifer's over but I think in October
I'm just going to have like some sort of
outfit diaries thing where I like film
outfits but also kind of vlog bits of
the day we'll see how that goes but
definitely not blogging every single day
because oh
it could burn you out they kept on doing
it so I'm gonna just vlog in moderation
and then you guys will get jungle bells
which is when I vlog every day in
December so do not worry anyway if you
guys enjoyed this video please give it a
thumbs up and leave me a comment if you
would like to tell me any of your
favorites or just want to say hello I'll
talk to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
