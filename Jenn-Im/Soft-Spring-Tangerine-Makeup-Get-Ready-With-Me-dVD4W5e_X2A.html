- [Jennifer] Hey guys, welcome back.
I've got a Face of the Month for you
that's perfect for the Springtime
so, here's my bare face.
I've got some SPF on,
but I want to prep my
skin more with the primer.
I'm using this one by Two Faced,
this is going to hydrate,
smooth and brighten my skin,
and I like to think that
it creates a barrier
so that way my foundation isn't
just like, right on my skin.
So, speaking of foundation,
I have been loving to
use this one by NARS.
I don't know why I like stick foundations,
like I really like the Hourglass one too,
but I think it's because it's
just a nice change of pace.
Sometimes I want liquid, other
times I prefer the stick.
This one is really precise
and it blends beautifully,
and throughout the day it
leaves my skin kind of dewy
and I like that it looks like my skin,
and not just a bunch of like
texture or cake on my face.
For a concealer I'm using Laura Mercier's
new Flawless Fusion
Ultra Longwear concealer.
I'm just gonna pop it
right underneath my eyes,
down the nose, and this
is just going to add
some extra coverage and
brighten up that area.
Alright, so let's seal
this up with a powder.
I actually ran out of
my Laura Mercier powder,
and it's kind of prompted me
to use different types of powders.
I'm using this one by MAC,
this one is a pressed
powder, which is interesting.
It's got a lot of coverage,
it does a great job
keeping everything in place
and most importantly, it does
not have flashback, thank God.
Alright, so let's fix these
non microbladed brows.
I've got a lot to draw in,
and so I'm using this
brow pencil by Hourglass.
First I didn't really like it,
it wasn't my favorite
because I found the pencil
to be quite hard and a
little difficult to use,
but just out of sheer
laziness I just kept at it
and now I love it!
And I think it's just
because I forced myself
to learn how to work with it,
and I think, as you
continue to use this pencil,
it gets softer and it
blends a lot creamier,
so I guess, just be patient with it,
and definitely make sure
to utilize this fully.
Okay, brows are done so let's
get started with the eyes.
I'm using this eyeshadow
primer from Tarte.
I love starting with a good juicy base,
and this pencil makes a great foundation
for any eyeshadow that you're
going to put on top of it.
It makes the colors pop
and it just makes them more pigmented.
For my eyeshadow I'm
using my girl Weylie's
palette collab with Pixi,
and I'm so proud of her,
I love all the shades in here,
they're all something that
you can wear every day.
I am using the Burnt Tangerine shade,
I'm just going to apply
that all over my lids.
I think this shade is super flattering
and very easy to blend.
Just grab that fluffy brush
and just soften the edges
and make everything
look nice and blown out.
Then with that same
shade, start dragging it,
not dragging it but just apply it,
at the bottom of the eyes,
and I think it just makes you look
more sultry, smoky, sensual.
I guess that's the look
we're going for today,
just a sensual tangerine.
So now we're going to bump up the orange.
I am using this palette,
I am getting the shade Tajin
which is a very vibrant orange shade,
and I'm going to apply that
right on the outer edges
of my eyes just to intensify
and bump up that color.
I'm actually using the brush
that came in the palette
which is very rare,
because most of the time
brushes in the palettes are
trash but this was great.
The dense side is great
for packing in color
and the other side is really
great for buffing it out.
So yeah, keep doing that
until you're satisfied with the color.
It's time for the glitter,
which is my favorite part.
I'm using my favorite,
Stila's Liquid Eyeshadow,
and I'm going to just carefully apply that
right at the closest part of my inner lid.
Does that make any sense?
Just apply it where I'm
showing in the video,
I don't want to go overboard,
I just want like a little
bit of glitter there.
I want a wing,
so here I'm using this
eyeliner from EM Cosmetics.
This is actually Karen's favorite eyeliner
and she got me hooked as well.
Get the brush tip though,
the felt one is really difficult to use,
at least for me personally.
I mean, I just grew up using brushes so,
if you like felt tips,
try the felt tip one.
But yeah, I'm going to do
my normal half cat eye,
meaning that I start at
like the half of my eye
and then I just stick a
wing out there somewhere.
Alright, so let's move on to the lashes.
I am curling them, and now
applying this mascara from MAC.
I actually love this
because it's got two wands.
The first is a normal one
for the tops of your lashes,
I'm just doing a light coat
so my falsies have something to grip on.
And then, in the smaller
tube, there is a baby one,
for my baby bottom lashes.
I love that this mascara gets
in all the nooks and crannies
of my microscopic lashes, it's great.
Alright, so I want some drama now.
I'm using these lashes from Velour.
I'm just going to, you
know, add some glue,
make it tacky and slap them on.
These lashes are so big
that I don't even need an
application tool for these,
they just fit perfectly right on my eye
and damn, they make a big difference.
I feel like my eyes look
at least 1.5 times bigger.
That's crazy.
Alright, so let's contour now.
I'm using Benefit's Hoola Lite
which is in this lovely cheek palette.
I'm just going to use the
brush that it comes with
because it's actually,
like when I use this brush
it's really hard to mess
up so I continue to use it,
and it just carves out some
cheek bones on my face.
I want some more orange for this look,
so I'm using this blush by NARS.
This isn't my first time using this shade,
I actually used it in my
previous make up tutorial.
I'm sorry I'm not using new products
but I just, what can I say, I
really like this orange shade.
I think it brings out my yellow undertones
and it makes me look perfectly sun kissed.
For a highlighter I'm using La
Peach by my girl Jackie Aina!
Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, Jackie!
Jackie, Jackie, okay, I'll stop.
But yeah, I love this
highlighter, it is stunning,
it's pigmented and glittery
and it just really ties
this entire look together.
If you're doing like a peach
look or an orange look,
throw some Rose Gold in
there, it looks amazing.
I'm going to apply some in
the inner corners of my eye
and the brow bone, just so that everything
is glowing the same color.
Final step, everyone!
I am using Fenty Beauty's Mattemoiselle,
am I saying that right,
Mattemoiselle, whatever.
I'm using the color S1ngle
and it is this peachy nude,
I know, very adventurous,
but hey, it looks great!
I love this formula, it's easy to apply
and actually really easy to take off too
and that's a big bonus for me
because I hate it when
my lips get so stained,
or like, rubbed raw from a
stubborn lip shade, so I love it.
So yeah, this, we're finished guys,
this is it, this is the finished look.
This is the make up look
that I actually did in my favorites video,
you guys asked for a
tutorial so here it is.
Please try it out and show me on socials,
I would love to see how
you slayed in this look.
Thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you guys
in the next one, bye!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
