second day of spring break I spent the
entire day driving down to Southern
California and I'm finally here and
right now I'm about to have dinner with
my mom we're gonna have sundubu and
she's driving me right now
so you guys gonna come with us - I guess
experience some Korean cuisine
you know being conceived in the wool
universe
hopefully Oh Bing - hello
time avila I'm giving you a little 10:00
p.m. check in after dinner I went to
have some tea with my friend Becca at
it's a grind and it was really funny
because our friend Josh happened to be
there so we just stumbled onto a man we
all just cut up and I'm pretty wiped out
I'm really happy that my tea had no
caffeine in it so I'm probably gonna
sleep like a baby tonight
tomorrow I have a really big day so I
guess you'll see what I'm up to tomorrow
tomorrow All Right see ya hi happy
Wednesday so today is the day I was
talking about last night I just had
lunch with a few pals and right now I'm
gonna head to maker studios to film an
episode of make up - breakups and I'm
overwhelmed with anxiety and excitement
I they're pretty much dead even right
now but overall it should be a pretty
fun show to film we didn't know make up
two breakups as a show on the platform
here on YouTube so be on the lookout for
that it should be out maybe within a few
months and then after I'm gonna get my
hair dyed by the lovely Miss Emily I'm
gonna dye my hair brown I'm kind of
nervous I had dark hair my entire life
or I bleached my bangs once when I was
15 but I don't think that really counts
um so yeah I guess we should down the
road all right come with me
Oh
hello it's Andrew and you're watching
Jim from Close Encounters actually took
over a channel it's my channel now okay
guys don't mind me so it's around 4:30
now and I finished filming the makeup to
pick ups episode and I'm so relieved
it went really smoothly and I had a lot
of fun I got a tour of the maker studios
or maker studios studio they have two
big buildings and I got a quick
run-through of that from Jenny and
Celeste and after I went on the show and
it's crazy to think that there's so much
production behind one show on YouTube
it's it's really admirable to see how
much effort it takes to make a show like
that and andrea was an absolute dream to
work with because she's incredibly
screen real live and just very personal
and just really easy to get along with
because she's so friendly now I'm done I
just arrived to Anna and Jessie's place
and for those who don't know who Anna
and Jesse are they have this wonderful
vlog on YouTube where they document
their everyday life it's pretty amazing
I watch them every morning as I'm eating
breakfast that's what I usually watch
all my YouTube videos and I think Claire
is in there too filming an episode so I
guess today's just like a YouTube day
other than that I'm going to become a
brunette now see you guys later
he's so into feet and raised
I freaking love it yeah I'm like it's
like significantly Brown yeah I
highlighted your hair um originally you
wanted to do a whole all-over face color
change but considering that you live up
north and up people would be too much I
decided to just do a lot of highlights
just so it's more be more natural and
just to be pretty and um and how I did
that was just with highlight color
really low volume peroxide so it took a
little bit longer to process but you'll
get the health and integrity of your
hair do you guys notice anything
different
my hair is brown can you tell I am
extremely happy with the results this is
the brown I wanted to go with and it's
very it's right shuttle but it's very
summery still - while we were dying my
hair we kind of had like a blogger party
I guess we had Lexie and Brian a fourth
street flat should definitely check out
their YouTube they're just up and coming
so you know give him a watch maybe you
like them and then I had Olivia Lopez a
full of lust for life who's pretty much
a blogger Legend so it was really
amazing me in here as well we had a
pizza party because we're really hungry
Matt Domino's and I was really relieved
to see that everyone else like dominos -
you have one of my favorite quests which
is the new garlic infused one ah and now
it's around 10 p.m. now and I think I'm
gonna head home
with my new hair mom's gonna be so
stoked so okay
I'll see you guys next time bye Jesse
bye bye Mookie hi Claire hi Ana
hmm right now I'm at the dread sense
offices I'm in their back patio and it's
gorgeous weather today as usual in
Southern California
vu and Melissa gave me the tour of the
entire place it is pretty huge I went to
the office to do their blogger hot
minute which is essentially just eight
interview and they had some pretty
interesting questions so you're gonna
have to wait for it I
think it's gonna be released within two
months I don't know
I will let you guys know I met the CEO
which is pebbles and pebbles is very
she's quite intimidating but I thought
that I think we hit it off I think we
did
staring contest so I just finished my
interview with red Suns everyone there
is an absolute angel super sweet fun and
just really fresh group people now it is
around 4 p.m. and I am waiting for my
brother to get off work so we can go get
dinner I'm at the lab right now as an
urban outfitters here so I'm gonna go
check that out didn't get anything at
Buffalo exchange but I got
that work now there's one including this
jacket and
and I got a pair of sunglasses as well
let me show you
and I just ordered a sangria because why
not I'm on spring break and my brother
should be here in around 20 minutes so I
guess I'll just read in Oh Sarah we are
in mirror view right now Jen looks
bigger because she's at a closer
vicinity to the mirror than I am which
is similar to the shooting of The Hobbit
where Gandalf is closer to the mirror
than the hobbits is that how it works
interesting yeah since Sarah is wearing
zero makeup right now I'm gonna do her
eye makeup so this is the before shot we
were gonna play Scrabble but we ended up
just drinking wine so we're using this
Naked palette that Jen got me for
Christmas two years ago Dane has eyes
again it's like probably one of the best
things you've ever given me it's it's
something that you will use every day
but you won't by yourself if you don't
think about it so I think that's the
perfect gift
those matte colors are used up because I
usually just wear makeup at family
functions and that's pretty neutral so
she really likes naked and yeah she
likes being buck naked I feel like I
failed I was supposed to do a sixties
eye but it looked nothing like that so
well I'm sorry that we didn't get any
footage of me actually putting makeup on
Sarah we had no one to hold it up and we
didn't have a tripod Wow I don't know I
just didn't come out as I thought it
would but whatever we're all going out
anyway so we're just gonna use makeup
wipes to get rid of it oh we need some
frozen bananas now it's Friday and today
has been a whirlwind I essentially did a
photo shoot with sugar and fluff and
they did a little table set up and they
also put me in a few dresses that my
friend Ashley made and overall I would
say is a big success I was wearing a lot
of clothes that really stretched me and
I thought it was different and something
new and unique for you guys
we are currently at this place called
Christmas house which is a little
bed-and-breakfast in Rancho Cucamonga
and yes Rancho Cucamonga is an actual
city in Southern California
me and Becca just moved into our new
house don't you like it yeah it's really
really nice tonight are we gonna board
this I don't know I am back in NorCal
Spring Break is officially over so that
explains the familiar background on my
last day of SoCal I went to this place
called Jurassic and it was a very
interesting restaurant in the fact that
they took their theme very very
seriously and there were dinosaur
carcasses just lift it up and suspended
the environment was kind of weird but my
friends just really made up for it
pretty much everyone I met up with went
to the same high school as me we were
raving about this appetizer which was a
cob of corn that was slathered in some
sort of barbecue sauce or something like
Asian barbecue sauce but it was really
really good and so we were just kind of
poking fun about how delicious it was I
think we took the joke too far
it's not how all that makes it fun time
but fun people that makes me one time
because I stranded in places that were
lame thinking alcohol would make it fun
but I did it it just made me drunk and
unable to leave a lame place three
dollars now is that on my spring break
and now I am in my first week of Spring
Quarter my last quarter of college and
be sure to look at the description box
to see some useful links probably if
you're wondering if someone has
Instagram or or some if someone has a
youtube channel their social media
networks will be there as well okay well
I'll see you guys the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
