- Hi everyone, it's your girl Jenn
and today I have a huge
spring haul for you.
I am so happy that spring is finally here
because I feel like winter fashion
is still kind of a struggle for me.
Like, I was born and raised
in southern California
so I have trouble styling
things when it gets cold.
So I'm glad things are warming on up.
I have a ton of things for you all.
I've got some thrifty pieces,
I got some Eggie pieces,
stuff from Revolve, Storets.
So let's just dive right in.
So I'm gonna start with tops first.
Here I have this sweater
that I thrifted for $3
at my local thrift store.
I got it because it
reminds me of something
that Mr. Rogers would wear.
And it's like a thick, chunky knit.
And I love the primary
and secondary colors.
You know, green is a secondary color.
I think it is very nostalgic looking.
I think it's kind of reminiscent of like,
the late '80's, early '90's.
All in all, I've just been attracted
to like, silhouettes like this.
This is something that
UNIF would have made
maybe like two or three years ago.
And I love it.
So this is another top that I
thrifted at that same store.
This was $1.99.
I fell in love with the corset details
and the huge bell sleeves.
This is just like a really romantic top
because of the velvet fabric
and the lace details on it.
I mean, it's like a little oversized
but it's nothing that I can't work with.
You just kind of tuck it into a sheer
or like, you know, stab
a safety pin in the back
and you're good to go.
For $2 you really can't go wrong.
Next up, I have a few things from Eggie
which is my clothing line.
We launched our festival
collection on March, 15th.
So I just kinda wanted to walk you through
some of my favorite pieces.
So, first we've got the Ambivert sweater.
This is a super cute crop turtle neck
that has the word ambivert
embroidered in red.
And this word actually means
someone who identifies as an
introvert and an extrovert.
And that's totally me.
The majority of me introverted, like 54%
and then, the rest of it is extroverted.
So I love, like, being social
and being around people
but I need to be by myself at some point
to recharge and center myself.
And I thought I couldn't
be the only person
that identifies with that so I thought
I would slap it onto a cute sweater.
This is great to wear
with high-waisted things
and just a really easy, casual item.
So this is the Molly tank.
This is another casual piece in my line.
It's red and white and it's in this really
summery springy seersucker material.
It also has these
self-tie spaghetti straps.
And I just wanted to make sure
that anyone who's wearing this
is able to adjust the straps accordingly.
Like, I hate when I get
a shirt and I can't like,
adjust the straps because I don't know,
like, my frame is like, a certain size
and it's just kind of ridiculous
to assume that everyone is
just gonna fit the straps.
And also, I have no boobs
so I need to always like,
make it as tight as possible.
So I wanted to give that freedom
to anyone who wears this.
This also has hidden pockets on the side.
So you can like, hide things in here
or you could just like, you
know, put your cellphone.
I just thought it would be like,
a really easy-breezy
top to add into my line.
If you guys really watch my channel,
then you guys know how
much I adore hot cheetos.
And I thought that I
would make a graphic tee,
showing you my favorite way to
indulge in my favorite snack.
And it's with chopsticks.
Because hot cheetos are
known for its red residue
and if you eat it with your fingers,
it literally stains like,
your fingernails and
your fingers for days,
and so, I just wanted to show you guys,
you know, a great way to indulge in them.
It also says, hot cheetos anonymous on it
because that way, no one will know
that you ate hot cheetos
'cause you ate it with the chopsticks.
So yeah, I wanted to create a shirt
for all my hot cheetos lovers out there.
So next up, I wanna talk about the blouse
that I'm rocking right now,
this is called the Hendrix top
and I think that this
just screams Coachella.
This is an off-the-shoulders
chiffon blouse
with this cute floral
pattern printed all over it.
The top has this ruching detail
so you can, you know,
cup your chest perfectly
with the satin tie.
It comes in two colors,
purple or lilac and black.
And I love this top, I
feel like this is something
that you can easily pair with denim
and just have like, the
wind blowing in your hair.
I love it.
I love lace, so I wanted to
create something ethereal
to put in the line.
This is a very deep V-blouse
with white scalloped eyelash lace.
I wanted this top to like, cinch the waist
and have it flare out in this
really fun, flirty silhouette.
I think white tops are something
that you can just like,
collect in your wardrobe
because they literally go with any bottoms
and plus, I think white
looks great on everybody.
Next up, I've got the Chloe top.
This is just a really cute bandeau top
in this comfy chambray material.
I love the little ruffles
at the top and the bottom.
I love wearing strapless
things at music festivals
because there's gonna be a lot of sun
and I wanna make sure
that it's even over here
and I think that this top
is gonna take care of that.
I think this is just a really comfortable,
fun top that's gonna
transition really well
into the summer time as well.
My last top is from Privacy Please.
This is a really lovely,
white off-the-shoulder tank.
And I wore this in Utah when
I was out there with Revolve.
And this was my go-to top
to wear with any bottoms.
I think because of how like, simple it is
and how flattering and fitted it is,
you can really explore and experiment
with any type of bottom
with a top like this.
Okie doke, let's move on to some bottoms.
Here I have the Marie shorts.
And these are so freaking cute.
These are some high-waisted
shorts with a ruffle hem.
I think ruffles are so
flirty and adorable.
This also has a white lace of detail.
And some silver hardware.
These also come in white as well,
and I think that these bottoms
are something that you can also
easily wear for the summer.
Next up, I've got this
pleather skirt from Storets.
This is such a vibrant red,
and I feel like red is still having
a huge moment in fashion.
This is definitely an eye-catcher.
And I would probably rock this on like,
a night out with the white top
and like a black moto jacket.
You really wanna go like, out out.
I would pair it with like,
something red on top as well.
Because if you're wearing red,
you might as well just
like, go all the way.
I think this is just
like, a really spicy item
that you can add to your wardrobe.
So at Eggie, we've developed
our first denim jeans.
These are so sick.
They're in a really
lovely light-wash denim.
And they're super soft and comfortable.
It's got some distressed
spots like on the knee
and around the cuff and what
I love about these pants
is the red embroidery that
says Eggie on the calves.
I think it's just like a
really fun, cute pop of color.
Like, let's say if you wear this with,
I don't know, like a red lip or something.
I feel like, little accents like this,
it really gonna bring it out.
This also has kind of like
a slouchy mom/boyfriend jean fit.
So they're really comfortable and relaxed
and perfect to rock on a casual day.
Alright, we are getting on
over to the dress section.
First up, I have this red sweater dress
from Lovers and Friends.
This is obviously in a
very bright red color.
It's ridiculously soft.
And you just feel really
cozy and comfy in it.
It's got a turtle neck and some
billowy puffed out sleeves.
And I think that this would look killer
with some thigh-high boots and a beret.
Moving on to something more casual.
This is the windy city breaker
and this technically like a jacket
but I have been loving
to wear it as a dress.
This is a baby blue windbreaker
with a elastic waistband and hood.
It's got these huge front pockets
so you can just ditch the purse at home
and have all your
necessities right with you.
This is definitely more of
like a street style vibe.
So pair it with some sneakers
and you'll be right as rain.
My next dress is from Majorelle.
This is a sweet polka dot dress
with some self-tie straps.
It fit and flares out and so,
it just gives you like a really
precious A-line silhouette.
Again, this is just another adorable dress
you can wear to a brunch or a date
or any place where you
wanna be looking sweet.
So this next piece is
technically, not a dress.
It's like a romper but I thought
it would fit the best in this category.
This is the kira slip and
it's just a satin romper.
Contrasted with some white lace.
It's got an elastic waistband
so your figure isn't lost.
And of course, it's got pockets.
This is something that you
can just lounge around at home
and then casually go out in
like the movies or lunch.
I feel like we're at
a point in our society
where it's acceptable to
wear pajamas in public.
So I thought, why not
make it look super cute?
So I love this next dress.
This is called the prairie girl.
This is so innocent and sweet
and you're literally gonna
look like a doll in this.
It's got my favorite silhouette
which is the fit and flare
and it has this sweet ruffled bib detail
on the front and the back.
It also has button details all on the side
so you can like, open it if
you wanna flash some more leg
or close if you like,
wanna be more conservative.
This is the type of dress
where you can take it
really sweet and innocent with like,
some braids and like a cute heel.
Or you can really toughen
it up with some fishnets,
moto jacket, black lipstick.
I think you can go two
ways with this dress.
This is another dress that
is perfect for picnicking.
This is called the bowie dress.
And it's in this really
trendy gingham pattern.
It's got ruffles in the sleeves
and a black corset cup
stitching detail on the bust.
This also flares out and
I think it's just adorable
to spin around in.
Like what can I say?
I'm just a sucker for dresses like this.
I think they're super cute
and flattering for everybody.
So the last dress is a little bit sexier.
This is a very bodycon dress
with a micro pattern on it.
It has this white contrast strap
so it makes it really pop.
It also has a little ruffle at the end.
And it comes in a luscious red color
and a universal black color.
This is just a form fitting number
that's definitely gonna turn some heads.
This next category is like
two-piece sets or matching sets.
So first, I have the Busan set.
This is named after a city in South Korea
where they're known for their beaches
and so, I wanted to create something
that would be perfect
for that environment.
So, over here, we've got the Busan top.
This is in a really summery
yellow gingham print.
It's got a ruffle at the end
and it has adjustable straps, of course.
And you have to pair it
with the Busan trousers.
These are very high-waisted
and they also have a cute
little ruffle at the calf
or the ankle, if you're short like me.
You could wear them together
or wear them separately.
This also comes in black as well.
If like, yellow gingham
is too loud for you.
I actually wore the black
version at A Rare Day
when I was presenting and I thought
that it looked really good.
These are really comfortable to wear
because they've got a little
bit of stretch to them.
So they will grow with you as you eat.
Next up, I've got the desert day set.
And I am obsessed with this.
So I'm gonna start off
with the jacket first.
This is in a really
smooth, suede-like fabric.
And it's got some silver hardware to it.
There is a very large silver hoop
on one of the front pockets
and I love the zipper detail in the back.
It's functional so you
can zip it up or down.
Whatever you feel like it.
And you could also match it
with the desert days skirt.
Now this skirt is killer.
It's an overlap miniskirt
with silver metal details.
It's got a chain and a grommet.
And I feel like this skirt looks tough
but it's still grounded
because of the shade.
I think that this top
would look really great
with white tops or like,
maybe like a black bodysuit.
This is definitely something
that reminds me of Coachella
and music festivals.
So we are on our last
category which is outerwear.
First up, I've got the madame robe.
This is definitely gonna be worn
at a music festival this year.
This is an orange duster
with this retro floral print.
I think this looks really groovy
and would pair so beautifully
with anything lace.
Or even like, a graphic tee.
A lot of the times, I love
rocking shawls like this
to like, the pool or
even like a beach because
it flows with your outfit perfectly
and you can derobe flawlessly.
So this next item is from Chriselle's
capsule collection with J.O.A.
This is the boyfriend blazer
and I absolutely love it.
This is perfectly oversized and long
so it covers the butt and you
just look really fresh in it.
It's got this taupe and
beige vertical stripes
that run all down it.
And I think that this is
so cool for the spring.
It's lightweight but it
still provides some coverage
because it's lined and you're definitely
gonna see me rock this
in future lookbooks.
Denim jackets are a must for spring.
And this white one is from GRLFRND Denim.
This is in a cropped white color
and I think that these
jackets work really well
with little dresses.
It just lightens up your palate
and offers a bit of coverage.
Like, I feel like spring can still have
a bit of that winter chill,
so a denim jacket is a really
easy transition outerwear.
Another great option for denim
is the hooped on you jacket.
This is an oversized
light washed denim jacket.
That is perfect to chuck
over any spring outfit.
It instantly makes anything
look more grounded and chill.
And it's got a bit of edge
because it's got this cool gun
metal detail on the sleeves.
It's like, got hoops so it looks like
your denim jacket is pierced.
This wash is also the same
as all the other denim
items in my collection.
So if you collect all three,
you can rock a pretty
amazing Canadian tuxedo.
So the last and final piece
is this thrifted jacket.
It's in this rich cobalt color
and clearly you can
tell I'm having a moment
with this color, and red and orange.
I feel like those are like,
my pop in spring colors.
But yeah, this is really cool.
It's got some quilting detail.
And also, these rock and gold studs.
I thought that this would
just be a retro item
to add to my collection.
And I just love having like,
vintage pieces in my wardrobe.
Alright guys, that is a
wrap on this huge haul.
I feel like, I don't even
know how many pieces I did
but I think it's like, definitely over 25.
Regardless, I will link
everything that's available
in the description box
so please open that.
I try my best to like, fill
it out as much as I can
because I just wanna make
things very easy for y'all.
I would love it if you
would comment down below
and let me know how your day is
or what kind of videos you'd like to see.
I feel like there are, there's like
a long list of things I wanna film
but I wanna know what
you guys would wanna see.
Like, I know I have to
film my workout routine.
I'm just trying to find like,
a gym where I can film it
because the gym that I work at,
there's always like a lot of people.
And so, I wanna like, go to
like my friends apartment
and use her gym but like,
we gotta coordinate a time.
So yeah, working on that for sure.
