today we're doing a style profile on her
and she's gonna be answering some of our
questions
my name is avalon and i'm 22 23 this
year and I am a student but I'm
graduating in May wait to New York but
I'm currently in San Francisco I don't
even describe it in one word but with
several words I guess menswear Parisian
romantic bohemian and seventies style
well I was going through like um a
creative rut like I was having like a
writer's block so you know I felt really
uninspired and then something I decided
I have to do something with my time like
do some productive so I was reading
reading blogs and thought I can do that
you know and then I finally invested in
a good camera I got a cannon and then I
got pictures taken and I would invite
about things that interests me I can
vaguely remember my first like restore
experience in San Francisco yeah I think
wasn't the Haiti and I remember I was
really excited like that was even my
style back then like Baghdad I wore kind
of really bright colors and studs I was
going through a weird phase and then you
know just being surrounded by people who
wore nice clothes and lifted clothes I'm
like okay let me you know explore a
different style so I guess I went
shopping in the Haight more often and I
ate was I discovered goodwill and good
old amazing
I know well always be obsessed with
Woody Allen I'm really loving prosciutto
and three and just good cheese that's
I'll eat that all the time and oh right
kill chips baked salt and pepper nobody
go music right now I'm listening to babe
ooh you should definitely visit Union
Street and Polk Street because this
really nice boutique on Polk Street
called flowers it's on Vulcan Washington
and heat Street just be fearless and
don't care about you know what people
think cuz it doesn't really matter it's
how you feel like if clothes make you
confident then wear whatever you want
because it doesn't matter what they
think I mean they can't pull off and if
you think you pull off like just do that
that's right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
