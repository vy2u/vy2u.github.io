- Hey, everyone!
It's your girl, Jen,
and I have a very
special guest here today!
- Hi, it's Aimee!
- It's Aimee, of Song of Style.
Today, Aimee is going to be
styling me in her clothes,
and I am so excited because
you have so much range
in your fashion.
- Being a Californian girl,
it's definitely like casual-cool,
but overall it has like
this polished sense.
- We're doing three outfits today.
One is an Everyday Aimee,
the second is Business Aimee,
and the third one is Girls Night Out.
- Turn up Aimee.
- Exactly.
- Like turn up, turn up.
(laughter)
- No, she goes all night, which is crazy.
But yeah, let's go head
into her closet now.
- Holy cow!
- You can have whatever you want!
- Oh my God, anything?
(jazz music)
- Do I look okay, guys?
- Yeah!
- Here we are, everyday Aimee.
- So, obviously, as you can see,
I'm a fan of high-waisted denim,
and anything that has, like,
some kind of distressed detailing,
that's like my thing.
I love pairing denim with
like pretty, flowy blouses,
because I feel like it's a
very easy way to dress it up.
I would either wear this entire ensemble
with like flats, pointy flats.
I love anything that's pointy.
And what's special about this outfit is
the see-through details, the ruffles,
the asymmetrical, and all
these, like, little buttons.
I love accessories.
So, like, I'll always a pair of earrings,
or at least one earring.
- I don't think I would actually, like,
naturally pick an outfit like this,
but seeing it on my body,
I absolutely love it.
- You love it?
- I feel so refined!
- Especially with this purse, man.
(laughter)
I think this is for an occasion
where I wanna look a
little bit more spruced up,
but I can still see the casual elements,
especially with the denim.
I think that really grounds it.
Alright, so let's get
into look number two.
Alrighty.
Here's outfit number two, Girls Night Out.
I feel very, like, sexy in this.
- [Aimee] For my Girls Night Out,
I love to go dancing,
and I'm all about,
like, being comfortable,
but still sexy.
I feel like this outfit makes
you look super slim and tall,
and really sexy, too.
(laughter)
I have, like, these sparking elements, so
I'm all about that one
earring, as I said before,
plus I don't know where the other one is.
(laughter)
And then I put you in this, like,
metallic Louis Vuitton skirt,
and I feel like it plays along
nicely with the sparkles.
And then also I think
this outfit is really sexy
because it shows a shoulder,
which is sexy but still, like,
polished at the same time.
I like to tone it down with the heels.
Since the sleeve is too big,
this is like my little
styling trick that I do.
I put in a hair tie that
like keeps the sleeves up.
- Oh my gosh, that's brilliant!
- Some sleeves are really big on you.
- I love this look.
It's also very like refined,
I feel elegant,
I feel like this is a good
after-party outfit, you know?
When you wanna go dancing,
but still look really chic.
Alright, so now I'm gonna
head onto the last outfit,
so I'm gonna shimmy on there.
(laughter)
Alright, the grand finale!
This is Boss Aimee, going to meetings.
- Oh my god, this is so crazy,
'cause it's like something
that I wear every day.
To see it on you...
(laughter)
- I know.
- It's so weird!
- [Aimee] I love wearing blazers.
I feel like as soon as
you put a blazer on,
you're kinda more like in
that serious mood, you know?
And also polishes the outfit.
It cleans the outfit.
- [Jen] Definitely.
- [Aimee] Because that's going on,
I like to keep the rest of the outfit
a little bit more fitted.
So like I like the ruffle
in here, I like the leather.
And normally I wouldn't like
mix too many different trends,
but I think it makes it fun
to carry on the ruffle theme
with the boots.
- Oh my gosh, yeah, these boots are fire.
Like I've never worn just
like under-the-knee boots,
I always go over.
But this is actually a really
refreshing silhouette on me.
- Then if I were to wear like
a button-up or something,
it would be too stuffy.
So I just like dressing
up my T-shirts, so.
This T-shirt's from my line, Two Songs.
- [Jen] It's so soft, by the way.
- [Aimee] And then I finish the outfit off
with my Chanel bag,
it's the Gabrielle bag.
And then I'm all about
stacking rings during work.
So like a lot of these are like from Dior.
I just also love mixing metals.
And then back to the one earring trend.
- This beautiful earring over here.
I love this.
It's got a really great contrast to it,
'cause you've got the menswear,
but you got the femininity
of the ruffle skirt.
It's really cute, I
absolutely love this look.
Alright guys, that is a wrap on the video.
Please let me know which
outfit was your favorite,
or which Jen-Aimee
version was your favorite.
(laughter)
And, yeah, if you guys are
not subscribed to Aimee yet,
please head on over to her channel.
She uploads very frequently.
- I'm trying.
- We also filmed a video on her channel,
where I style her in my outfits.
That one's gonna be really fun.
So, yeah, thank you so much for watching,
and I'll see you in the next one.
Bye!
- Ciao!
- Mwah!
