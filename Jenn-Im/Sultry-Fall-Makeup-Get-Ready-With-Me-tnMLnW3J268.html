It's your girl Jen, and for
today's face of the month
I'm giving you this very
wearable fall autumnal look.
I have partnered with Clinique
again and I'm so happy
because they're literally
one of my favorite brands.
They came up with a new
foundation, which is their
Even Better Glow Light
Reflecting Makeup Broad Spectrum,
and obviously I'm wearing
this on my face today.
It gives you a nice radiant glow,
and I've paired it with
some nice coppery eyes.
So if you'd like to see how I did this,
then let's roll to the next clip!
So here's my face with no makeup,
and I'm just gonna start with primer.
I'm using this one from Laura Mercier.
This is just going to
create a nice smooth base
for the foundation we're about to put on.
So let's move on over to the foundation.
I'm using Clinique's Even Better Glow
Light Reflecting Makeup Broad Spectrum.
I am in the shade Meringue.
This actually improves your
skin's radiance instantly
and over time, because it has
like luminizing properties
and vitamins C and A, so,
I'm very excited to see
what my skin looks like
by the end of the month,
as I continue using this.
Gosh, it's given me like
a nice glowy look already.
I would say the coverage
is sheer to moderate.
My skin is still peeking
through, which I like,
because I don't want to cover anything up
because it's just nice
when skin looks like skin.
So the foundation's all blended in,
and I love the way it looks.
This is only $28, and you
can grab it at any Clinique
counter nationwide, or just
get it online at Clinique.com.
I literally purchase everything online,
or on my phone, so if you're lazy like me,
that's always an option.
I want a little bit more
coverage under my eyes,
so I'm going to use this
concealer from ColourPop.
It is their No Filter Concealer,
and I'm just going to pop
that right underneath my eyes
just to brighten up this area.
Might as well do a little bit on my nose
and forehead and chin.
I'm going to blend this out
and answer the first question,
this is from Sherilyn.
What are the first three things
you think of when you wake up?
By the way, I love you,
congrats on Eggie Shop,
I can't wait to see what's next!
Aw, thank you!
So the first thing I think about is,
what did I dream last night?
I've always loved to log my dreams.
I really should journal them more,
but if a dream is really
unusual or interesting,
I'll try and like write a little
two or three sentence
synopsis on my phone.
Number two, I just check my Instagram.
It's just a really easy
way for me to you know,
keep up with my friends,
see what they're up to,
and just stay connected,
and the third thing
is just taking Cheeki out to go pee.
She needs to go, so, I let her out.
So now I'm just going to set
everything with a powder.
I'm using Too Faced, Born This
Way Ethereal Setting Powder,
and honestly this is one
of the finest powders
I've ever used in my life.
I'm just going to dust some off and then,
I'm going to pack it
underneath my eyes, forehead,
smile lines, ooh. (coughs)
I always try my best not to like
inhale any of it when this is out.
So now the base is all done.
I'm going to move on to brows.
I'm using Diorshow's brow styler,
and I'm just doing what I normally do.
I'm going to go in to the meat of my brows
and just fill that in.
What was your favorite part
in creating your brand Eggie Shop?
By the way I love you.
Aw, thank you!
My favorite part was
definitely seeing the samples
for the first time, and
it was just so crazy
to see something just in theory,
into like concrete, tangible things.
As you guys know, I didn't
go to fashion school
or design school, so it
was really important for me
to build a team around me
that knew how to do it,
so I worked really closely
with the design team
at Eggie, and I just
feel so lucky and blessed
to have them on my team.
They have been amazing to work with,
and it's just been awesome
to put whatever idea
that's in my head, into
just concrete pieces.
I love going on my Instagram
and Eggie's Instagram
and just seeing who's tagged the clothes.
It means so much to me that
you guys are supporting
the brand, and I just
can't wait to show you guys
the next drop, it's going to be insane.
And now let's move on
over to the eyeshadow.
I am gonna use this huge
palette from Lorac Pro.
It's their Mega 2 Palette, and
it's just got so many colors.
I think I'm just going to go
in with this shade over here,
called Burlap, and I'm
just going to use that
for the outer corners of my eyes.
(light jazz)
So now I'm going to go in with Goji,
which is kind of like a soft plum color,
and I'm just gonna put
that in the crease again,
but closer to the eye.
I'm just going to intensify
this a little bit more,
and I'm going to go in to Cabernet,
and I'm just going to start
putting on the outer corner,
again, like even closer to the lid.
I'm also going to try and
like feather a little bit
of this outward, so it just looks
like nice and soft and sultry.
So now I'm going to go in
with ColourPop So Quiche,
and this is kind of like
a metallicy copper shade,
but it has like purple reflects in it.
I'm not sure if they'll be shown,
but I'm gonna just pop it
on my lid with my finger.
Here goes nothing.
(light jazz music)
â™« Ooh
- Looks pretty good!
Now I'm going to go back into burlap,
and I'm just going to apply
this all over the underlid,
so it can balance the entire eye out.
I can't forget the inner corner highlight,
so I'm going to go in with seashell.
I'm going to pop that
in the inner corners.
- [Woman] Ooh!
- And all over the browbone.
I'm going to intensify
this a little bit more
with Smashbox's Always
On Gel Liner in Moody,
and I'm gonna line the upper eyelid.
I'm trying to skip liquid
liner for this look,
so I want it to be really soft.
Gonna give my lashes
a nice little squeeze,
and then I'm going to use
this mascara from Innisfree,
it's their Skinny Microcara,
and look how tiny the brush is.
It's literally like a little stick,
but apparently they're
supposed to be really good
for tiny lashes like mine,
so we'll see how it goes.
Hey Jen, what has been your motivation
to continue filming slash
working through a creative block?
I'm going through one
now and I need advice.
Honestly, I go through
creative blocks all the time,
and the way I deal with it is
just by powering through it.
I feel like, as an artist,
it's important for me
to have my practice as a daily thing,
and my practice is to create videos.
I was watching this interview
by this incredible artist
named James Jean, and
he is one of the most
like prolific artists out there,
he has so much work, and
it's because he paints
every single day, even if
he doesn't feel like it.
And he was explaining
how our bodies are just
mechanical vessels for our mind,
so there are going to
be times where our mind
just isn't all there, but
your body's still functioning,
so you might as well just carry on.
Like I've noticed that once I'm on a roll,
I just like to stay on that
roll as long as possible.
For me it's all about having a streak,
and even if I don't feel like doing it,
I just suck it up and do it.
It's impossible to feel
creative all the time,
but it's important to make
sure that you're prepared,
so when that spark of
creativity does come,
that way you can ride the wave.
So now I'm going to just
put on some falsies.
These are by Velour, they're
called Girl You Crazy!
And I'm just going to pop 'em on my eyes.
So now that the falsies are on,
I'm going to move on to bronzer.
I'm using this one by It Cosmetics.
It has like a spectrum of
different products you can use.
You have a bronzer, a
blush, and a highlight,
but I'm just going to go
into the bronzing section,
tap some excess off, and
I'm just going to start
warming up my cheekbones.
What is the most important
relationship advice
you would give on how to keep
a strong lasting relationship?
That is a very good question.
I would say communication,
and delivery is key.
I feel like when you're open
and honest about everything,
then there's no room for
distortion or secrets.
If I ever have an issue or
if Ben every has an issue,
we talk about it, and
the way you communicate
is a huge thing as well.
Make sure that you're not
coming off like too naggy
or your tone is right, also,
make sure it's an environment
where you guys are ready to have
like a long open
conversation, 'cause sometimes
when you don't plan or time things right,
it can just kind of blow up in your face.
My relationship is definitely
not perfect and it's something
that I'm working on as
well, especially the tone.
Sometimes when you're upset,
it's hard to control it,
so this is advice for both of us really.
For blush I'm just going
to use the middle strip,
going to dust that onto
the apples of my cheeks.
- [Woman] Oh that's nice!
- For highlighter, I'm using Fenty Beauty.
I just got this, and look what I did.
I literally dug my nail into
it as I was trying to open it
and (sighs) I was so devastated you guys,
'cause now it just looks so morphed.
I'm going to put a little bit on my nose,
and on the cupid bow.
For the lip color, I'm just
going to go with a nude.
This is Dior's Rolling, and it's just like
a really gorgeous
moisturizing salmon shade.
All right guys, this is
the finished makeup look.
I wanted something that
was still very everyday,
but just something that popped too.

Bye! Mwah.
