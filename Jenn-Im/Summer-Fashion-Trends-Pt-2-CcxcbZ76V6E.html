Hawaii now so since Jen made her summer
trends video I'm going to show you my
favorite pics for summer it's really fun
to play with retro looks so since 70s is
in right now
I'm loving this blouse with this mustard
and black pattern on it and it's really
nice to pair with like high-waisted 70s
wash denim
trend on money is a nautical trend
because it kind of signifies that whole
like code motion scene and that's really
good for summer and to like that out I
got this navy blue and white stripes
frock and it's like a short little dress
with pockets so it's really nice to go
out in summer nights
an accessory trend on money is gold
cuffs it's like this one that Jenna
thought for me when she was in London
and it's just this nice gold braided
pattern and it's kind of got a boho feel
which is nice
in summer you really want to wear
lightweight and just cooler materials
like that so I like this maxi sheer
skirt because it's got a really bold
color and it's great for putting
Overland somewhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
