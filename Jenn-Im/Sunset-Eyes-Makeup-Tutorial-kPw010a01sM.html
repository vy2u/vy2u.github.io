partnered up with Smashbox to show you
this makeup look summer is coming to an
end
so I thought I'd create a sunset
inspired theme with a glowy flawless
base using Smashbox studio Skin
Foundation and concealer it's been
tested to look good in every light so
you're going to be looking flawless
anywhere you go I've already prepped and
primed my skin as usual you know the
drill so now I'm just going to go
straight into concealer I'm using
Smashbox is Studio skin concealer and
I'm going to apply it on my under eyes
forehead and chin to just brighten up
these areas this is a medium to full
buildable coverage so you can always put
as much or as little as you need I love
that this formula doesn't crease which
is crucial for me because I tend to
smile a lot now let's go into foundation
I'm using Smashbox studio Skin
Foundation for my base and I'm just
going to dot the product on my face and
blend away this is an incredible summer
foundation because it's sweat and
humidity resistant so you can make the
most of outdoors while you still can I
love this foundation because it's the
perfect color match for me and it stays
consistent in any sort of flight I
noticed for a fact because it's been
tested in the flash box lighting lab now
that the foundation is finished I'm
going to seal the deal with a
translucent powder I'm using pixies
powder to protect all that blending we
just did speed up time I'm going to
quickly draw on my brows and move
straight into the eye shadows today I'm
popping out tois from my gennosuke
collection with color pop this is an
edgy reddish burgundy color and I'm just
going to pop that all over the lid then
i'm using do a blending shade this has a
slight orangie hint to it so it's going
to blend out that red beautifully and
naturally for intensity I got a go in
with cats to deepen the eyes and give it
that depth that I want I want to add
some golden tones so I'm gonna go in
with get lucky and add this golden
shimmer into the inner corners of my
eyes and then pop some on the brow bone
now it's really starting to look like
this time setting it's time for eyeliner
so I'm grabbing Kat Von D's tattoo liner
to quickly draw on a cat eye I always
like to start from the middle of my eye
and then just kind of flick it up I'm
still craving a little bit more drama so
I'm just gonna use a black matte
eyeshadow and I'm just gonna define my
outer crease a little bit more yeah
that's much better it's time to grab
your favorite mascara and coat your
lashes as for me I'm just gonna focus on
my lower lashes because I'm just gonna
pop some falsies these are from blinking
beauty and they just amp up the look in
seconds all right let's carve some
cheekbones today I'm using elfs bronzer
to contour this is just going to slim my
face down I want to blush with a pop of
coral so I'm using Mac's love cloud I
love how this just brings all the color
back into my face it's time to add some
glow so I'm gonna go in with my
highlighter from Becca and I'm dabbing
some shine on the tops of my cheeks nose
and Cupid's bow now we just got to
finish off with the lips I'm using my
signature coral shade togi and to make
the shade more wearable dab the product
onto the inner lips and then with your
finger just gently Pat and blend it out
this is going to dilute that coral shade
into a wearable peach okay I'm just
wanting a little bit more glow so I'm
going to use my touch'
dewy skin mist and spray it all over the
face and voila we're done that is the
finished look
prepare to slay in any sort of lighting
situation or it
all right folks so that is a wrap on
this mix tutorial I want to thank

me in this video because I genuinely
love their products I feel like my skin
looks more radiant using their
foundation and concealer so I would love
