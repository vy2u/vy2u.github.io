- Today is a laundry and cleaning day.
(jazz music)
Alright guys I am finished
cleaning, for now.
I vacuumed the entire house,
I wiped down the surfaces,
I cleaned the house because today
I'm having some friends over.
I feel like whenever we have guests
it's just a good excuse
to clean the house.
But, yeah a bunch of my high
school friends are coming:
Jon, Breann and of course
Sarah! She is in town.
For those who are new
here, Sarah is my friend
that I started the channel with
for you OG subscribers, you
already know who she is.
But, yeah she lives in
San Jose so every time
she comes down, we try our
best to see each other.
And it's gonna be so
nice to just be reunited.
She's coming in like 20 minutes
so I'm actually removing some nail polish.
So basically I got a gel
manicure two weeks back
and I picked out this red color,
thinking that it was
more of like a true red
but it's actually more
of a orangey-coraley red.
And I just wasn't diggin' it so
I went in my nail polish collection
and I re-painted it this dark navy color.
But now that it's chipping it's
starting to look kinda weird
It looks like hot cheeto residue.
So I'm just removing that first layer off
and just making all my fingers red!
It's like a magic trick.
So yeah, I'm gonna do
the same with this hand
And then I'll be ready fer,
I'll be ready for my guests.
I have the entire house to myself
because Ben is in San Diego.
He's at a music festival
with a bunch of his friends
and I believe Foo Fighters are playing
and that is one of his favorite bands;
definitely his favorite drummer.
And so, yeah he's out there
and he's having a good time.
I'm here with Chippo and I'm gonna
have some company really soon.
Yay, Cheers!
(jazz music)
Balloons, check.
Hey everybody, so as you can tell
I have just been rushing around town.
I am gathering all the things
I need for Ben's birthday weekend.
His birthday's on Friday
but the celebrations start tomorrow.
And he has no idea.
He thinks I am shopping for
Halloween costumes right now.
So, (laughs)
So I got the cake, and I got the balloons
and now I am dropping all
of this off at Bern's house
because tomorrow I am surprising him
with a stay at the Beverly Hills hotel.
I got us a room there and
I have never stayed there.
It's like one of the most iconic
and most beautiful hotels.
And it's pet friendly so
we get to bring Cheeki.
So tomorrow morning I'm just
going to tell him to like
pack his bags and just drive him there
so that's going to be exciting.
We've got dinner plans at
nine pm at the Polo Lounge
and while we're at dinner
I have told all our friends
to go into the hotel room;
Berns is gonna bring all of this stuff
and they're just going to set it all up
and I just can't wait to see his reaction
it's gonna be so satisfying.
I just, I love planning
other people's birthdays.
It's like way more satisfying
than planning my own.
I'm just so excited to see his reaction
because he is one of the most
important people in my life
or probably the most
important person in my life.
He has done so much for me
and he's transformed my life
and he's given me a love
that I've never had before
and I've had a lot of
great loves in the past
but nothing can top his.
It's not a competition
but he's just the one
and something about his energy
and his presence that makes me want
to become a better
person and, I don't know
if you're watching this,
babe I fucking love you.
You are, you're the one! (laughs)

I'm not even looking at the google maps.
I never want to make a
big fuss on my birthday
I don't really, especially
now I'm like 50-something.
(laughs)
Chippo, what's the surprise?
I know you're in on it.
You've been acting suspicious all day,
don't look away from me,
what is the surprise?
Oh, now you're just trying to hide.
- [Both] yeah!

This is ridiculous.
- [Jenn] So this is the

- Ah, I know Cheeki it's
comfy, isn't it, I know, yeah

Then over here we have the bathroom.
Look at the tub.
Ah! And they even provided
a tiny chocolate cake!
Do you wanna take a bite?
- [Ben] Yes please

green light to eat it.
(laughs)
(jazz music)
Chug it!

were doing nothing today
- Yeah
(laughs)

massaged was unbelievable
Another great surprise from Jen.

(guitar music with light vocals)
I believe the last clip
you saw was us at the Broad
at the Yayoi Kusama exhibition
That was honestly one of the
best shows I've ever seen
in a really, really long time.
I love The Broad museum
because they don't half-ass
any of their exhibitions,
it's freakin' nuts
and I feel so blessed that
Flaunt Magazine and The Broad
invited us for their private preview
it meant so much, I highly
recommend you go see it
I can comfortably say
that Kusama is probably
one of my favorite artists.
Her work is so immersive, meticulous
and I just really like
everything she stands for.
I didn't know how prolific
she was with her work.
She started in the 60's and
she's always been standing up
for things that she believes in
whether it's: free love,
women's rights, gay rights
She's always been very vocal.
I highly recommend you go see it.
It is on til January 2018 so
definitely go check it out if you can.
Oo, I uploaded my &amp;quot;How
I Lost 15 Pounds&amp;quot; video
That video's doing really well
and I wanna thank everyone
who has watched it
and left such positive comments on it.
I am so happy to help anyone
who wants to have just
a healthier lifestyle.
(jazz music)
(laughs)
Hello it is four days before
Halloween it's Friday.
James is preparing for his show
where he'll turn into a skull!
(drums, guitar and flute plays)
- [Jenn] Alright, are you
ready for the big reveal?
- Yes
- [Jenn] Okay
- I'm scared
- [Jenn] Open your eyes
- Whoa! This shit looks good!
- [Jenn] You like it?
- Yeah looks cool
(jazz music)
- What's up guys it is Monday.
I am currently on my
way to the Eggie shoot
We are shooting the product
shots for drop number two
very, very excited to see
everything on somebody else
I found this model named Jawni
She was modeling for my
friend's clothing company
and I was like oh my god, I'm obsessed.
And so she gave me her contact
and now I'm going to meet her!
It's gonna be really
awesome getting to see
an entire new collection like this.
This always makes it
feel more real for me.
It's gonna be awesome seeing my Eggie team
And just, you know, get to work.
(jazz music)
Hello, so from the last clip you saw
that Ben and I went to The Empty Vase
to look at some flowers for our wedding.
Wedding planning is in full force
and I honestly thing that's
why it's been extra hard
to vlog this month, I've just
been like wearing extra hats
like I feel like just my responsibilities
for my channel is quite hefty
and now I've added obviously
Eggie and now the wedding
so it's like three different components
that I'm like splitting my brain into.
So back to the flowers,
we went to the Empty Vase
and they are my favorite florist
I am so happy to be working with them
because they make beautiful arrangements
and the color scheme
we're going for is like
white, coppers and greens
so just kind of like ethereal,
earthy and beautiful.
Next week I am gonna be
trying on some dresses.
That should be really fun.
I've created like a Pinterest board
of different dresses that I'm into
and I'm noticing a pattern, a
lot of off the shoulder stuff.
Honestly I didn't use Pinterest
at all until like this year.
Because obviously I had to
do some boards with Eggie
and now especially for
the wedding, it's insane.
I also see the appeal of Pinterest as well
because it's so nice to see all the images
that you have on your mind
like on an actual visual board.
So I get it, I get Pinterest now.
So today is Halloween
and I am just going to
be staying in editing.
I've got a bunch of
deadlines due tomorrow.
This weekend we went out
so I feel like Halloween is already over
because I celebrated Halloween
on Friday and on Saturday.
So I'm just like done.
This is the costume that
Ben and I had for Halloween.
We are Wayne's World and Cassandra
who is the original OTP.
If you guys haven't seen that
movie, please go watch it.
Also, if you guys didn't know,
Ben started his own Youtube channel.
I am so proud of him.
He already uploaded his second video.
If you guys haven't
checked out his channel
please hit on the cards
or the description box.
I will leave everything down there.
Other than that, I'm just
going to continue on editing.
November will be a better
month because I think
I'm starting to get a better
grasp on everything hopefully.
Okay, well I guess this is my cue to go
I wanna thank you guys
so much for watching
and I will see you guys
in the next one, bye!
