we are doing the best friend tags we're
just gonna answer a series of really fun
questions about us we split the
questions to two parts so you can watch
the rest of the questions on Stephanie's
channel I think we have just like so
many memories together it's like do ya
like every day that we spent together is
amazing it's so good especially Thursday
night like that's our girls night out
night yeah and it is so much fun we care
it up in the city being in my place and
getting ready it gets it's just so much
fun yeah it truly is when we're not
together it's so fun like last week we
were texting for like an hour like where
were you in back and I'm yeah like that
I got angry but I actually dropped my
phone in my face twice about laughing so
hard I bet my neighbor to like what is
going down an apartment I would say it's
great because YouTube in itself is kind
of interesting it's a community yeah if
you never really had that guy glimpse
into it or if you don't understand like
what it is and you tried to scribed it
somebody they're really confused yeah
they think you're kind of crazy like who
watches YouTube videos but they don't
understand that it's a very specific
community and those who are in it are
really really deep in it and it's also
good because we're able to help each
other out especially if we're kind of
unsure about a video idea I can send it
over to her I'd be like what do you
think about this and we also help each
other film yeah it's like so win-win
situation yeah Laura okay so every time
we see each other we always do this we
would like to do hi
and then when we say bye it's like a
very obnoxious the heels all the way I
don't think we ever wear flats because
we're both shorties so if one of us is
wearing heels like the other one has to
wear yeah or else like it's very much my
name yeah cuz you're five inside blood
my flow okay I'm five too so yeah we're
short sure
well Stephanie is a pant girl yeah I
just like being it's like get down be
like you know flap your wings oh you
just go for everything yeah cross the
spectrum it's a red panda
oh my song there's that YouTube video of
a red panda just chillin and he gets so
freaked out because the caretaker puts
his foot in front of him and it's just a
really viral video link it if you want
to see it but it's just the cutest thing
ever
so mine isn't honored oh I can see that
I love otters so much like the video
with the otters that hold hands oh when
you're sleeping and you're floating and
then they separate and then one I was
like and then kind of slows back over to
the other otter it is a life yeah I've
seen it video I think and watch that
video at least 20 times I'm not
surprised yeah I would say like all my
photo albums and stuff from like for the
past like my weird pictures in first
grade where I'm like hella KCAL of my
finger and like family photos yeah yeah
Mentos hm I would probably just say my
laptop because the hassle yeah it has
all my stuff anyway yeah boring answer
hmm that's pretty practical steps
favorite movie is life aquatic by Wes
Anderson
it's her a screen saver on her laptop
when they're seeing that giant future
underwater leopard shark yeah yeah
that's been my what's it called
background for like years yeah ever
since that movie came out yours is
eternal sunshine mm-hmm it's always my
yeah that's my favorite movie of all
time I could watch it forever and ever
right I haven't watched it in full okay
doll could have to remember interview
that doors right there you can see
yourself you will you watch with
modulated yeah we collect you later so
Stephanie always drinks this tea like
block tea I always have it when I sleep
over our house because she's like once
I'm G when we wake up I'm like sure so
she always like that
yep and then she puts a call bag huh in
it to make it's neat yummy and a little
bit of milk mm-hmm very British yeah
yeah I grew up drinking that though I
think it's because my mom grew up in
Hong Kong the Hong Kong area so it's
very British yours is now the
me juice honey juice baby yeah yeah
supposed to be super good for you John
just told me about it a little bit ago
and like I made a drink a glass of it
not too long ago honestly I just choked
it and then it wasn't that bad it's
doable for sure yeah yeah but it's not
like I'm craving noni juice ever but if
it's not good for you you should do it
something physical is our unis acid Tom
yeah cos roads together and they had
these two unit shirts and we're like
let's get up I was actually recently in
one of your episodes of the get up so
the one half only plan was the cropped
hoodie with a hat mm and like
high-waisted jeez yep but then for some
reason all the other outfits matched as
well yeah are like similar color schemes
very complementary yeah with the one
plate of both ripped tights
oh yeah like we both yeah it was weird
but yeah because all your tights are
ribbed I know
not on purpose I ripped them and faller
I don't know get them cotton things no
she was a rugged life punk rock mane we
watch a lot of the same TV shows I'm
walking dead that's a huge one Parks and
Rec yep Game of Thrones
