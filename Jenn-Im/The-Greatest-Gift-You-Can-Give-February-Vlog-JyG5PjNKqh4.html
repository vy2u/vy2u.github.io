- [Jenn] Good morning, this
is our breakfast for today.
Wow, we definitely got a feast.
I got the egg white omelet
with spinach and mushroom.
The weather's now clearing up.
I looked up the weather forecast.
Raining all week.
♪ A tiny little Tabasco. ♪
My favorite is actually Tapatio,
but they never have it at hotels.
But it's okay, Tabasco's really good too.
- [Stephanie] Tapatio,
they don't do mini's.
I've never seen a mini.
- Yeah, me neither.
There's a hole in the market.
(mellow music)
- [Jenn] This is my favorite album
by Kanye West, &amp;quot;Graduation&amp;quot;
and this is the famous Kanye Bear.
(mellow music)
- [Woman] I want one of these flower bags.
Buy me.
(woman laughs)
- [Jenn] Okay, what do you guys think?
Does it go with my outfit?
(mellow music)
- Your Murakami inspired luncheon.
(mellow music)
- [Jenn] There's Ashley
with all her friends.
Here we are at The Botanist.
So, I'm here with Ashley
and Stephanie of course.
- Just Botanist (laughs).
- Just Botanist.
- Botanist, no &amp;quot;The,&amp;quot; no &amp;quot;The.&amp;quot;
This was actually
recommended by Mike Africa
of Oak and Fort, so thank you so much
for the recommendation.
This is, the aesthetic is
already like, too much.
I want my whole house to look like this.
(mellow music)
- So we just finished our delicious lunch
and know we are at Canada Place.
[Stephanie] I love when there's a Chevron.
[Jenn] It's so cute.
[Stephanie] That's the
one thing I comment on
and the beautiful view.
(mellow music)
- [Ashley] So, we're shooting
a look book right now
for Jenn's channel.
Robert's the videographer, @roberthill.
It's supposed to be a rainy day look book,
but it's not raining.
(mellow music)
- Today we are leaving Vancouver.
We are pretty much all packed up.
I took a nice bath this morning
and I feel so fresh and so clean.
I love it.
There Stephanie is, she is
just packing her belongings.
I feel like my whole body is so dry here.
I don't know why.
I think it's just because
it's a lot colder here,
but, yeah, today, or I guess
last night was a lot of fun.
I didn't take my camera out.
We went to the Murakami
after party birthday bash
and it was a lot of fun.
There was great music,
but now we are just
getting ready to go home.
But before, we are grabbing dim sum.
- [Stephanie] Yes.
- [Jenn] Before we left,
I wanted to do a little room tour.
These were are beds that we slept in.
This was Stephanie's
side, this was my side.
Over here, we've got the bathroom.
Very comfortable, spacious, well-lit.
Over here, I've got a bottle
of wine from last night.
- [Stephanie] Half drunk.
- [Jenn] Half drunk.
This is our little living area.
Got some work done here
and then we've got a view of
this hardworking building.
- [Stephanie] Not there
today, though, it's Saturday.
- [Jenn] Yeah, not there today,
but it was interesting to see
corporate life right across us.
Got a very large TV screen.
And, honestly, that's about it.
Yeah, that was our room.
- [Stephanie] Go show
them the, show them the...
- [Jenn] The bar area? Oh, yeah, okay.
Alright, this is the last,
this is the grand finale.
We've got the bar area.
We used this every single
day, the espresso machine.
Oh, and she didn't tell
me about these chips.
A couple nights ago, I was
like I'm really craving chips
and she was like, oh,
well, there's nothing.
But there was.
- [Stephanie] For your
health, Jenn, for your health.
- [Jenn] I love sour cream and onion.
That's our hotel room tour.
We look like witches (laughs).
(mellow music)
(mellow music)
(mellow music)
- We used the one that has more move
rather than these.
(mellow music)
- [Ashley] Are we changing the hair now?
- Yes.
- [Ashley] Okay, 'cause I need to do a
tighter curl for that look.
- For the Gigi look?
Hi, everybody, it is Thursday
and today is actually
a really exciting day
because we're shooting for
the Coachella drop for Eggie.
I am so stoked.
We are at my friend
Honor and Brandon's house
and their home is literally
like a 70s wonderland.
And so, yeah, I can't show
you too much of the clothes,
'cause I want it to have
some sort of suspense,
so I'm sorry if don't get too many clips.
I just finished hair and makeup.
My hair is by Ashley and the
glam is by Daniel Chinchilla.
It's such an incredible job
and I am so blessed to
have a team like this.
- Do you want anybody?
- We earned this one guys.
- Oh, definitely.
They only gave me two California rolls.
Excuse me?
- [Woman] Two pieces?
- What?
- [Woman] How much are
you supposed to have?
- At least four, at least four.
♪ Summer snow, summer snow ♪
♪ Summer snow, summer snow ♪
- [Jenn] Congratulations Laylee.
- Thank you.
- [Jenn] I'm so proud of you, my baby.
Currently at the Eggie headquarters
planning for the summer drop.
- It's not really velvety, but kind of,
but it's like sparkly.
- Ooh.
♪ Summer snow, summer snow ♪
- Look how pretty this wrapping paper is.
Hey, baby girl.
These presents are for Amy.
Today is Amy's 24th birthday, I believe.
And I'm gonna see her in a couple hours.
I'm gonna take her out to dinner
and then we're all gonna go out bowling
which should be fun.
I know I already went bowling,
like, a couple nights ago,
but I think that was meant for practice.
And although I'm not the best bowler,
I just really like the
atmosphere bowling alleys have.
There's like food, there's
drinks, there's music,
there's competition and
it's just really fun.
But yeah, I'm so excited to
be spending Amy's birthday
because Amy has been
such a gift in my life.
It's so crazy how close we've gotten
within the past six or seven months.
She also has a YouTube channel,
so please go check her out.
I'll leave her link in
the description box,
but she's incredible for advice
and for recommendations for books
and she's just an all
around amazing person.
So, please go check her
out if you have some time.
So, I just finished writing
my birthday card for Amy.
Whenever it's someone's birthday,
I really like to write out a card.
And not just like a, &amp;quot;Happy
Birthday, Love, Jenn.&amp;quot;
I like to really go in and talk
about what I love about that person,
how far we've come, or
something I'm proud of them for.
I think I'm just a very vocal person
and if I have a lot on my mind,
I want to tell them because
I feel like life is so short.
I mean, God forbid something happens.
Like I, if this is the last
time we are able to speak,
I would want them to know
everything that I feel about them
and I know there's that saying like,
&amp;quot;Oh, some things are just known&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;Some things are unspoken,&amp;quot;
I forget what that phrase is.
But, basically, I don't believe in that.
I think you should say how you feel
especially if you love someone so much.
And so, whenever I write
like a Valentine's Day card
or a birthday card or a
Christmas card, I try and go in
and when people do that
to me, it means so much.
And I think it's because
words of appreciation
is pretty high on my love languages test.
I feel like this world
needs so much more love.
So much more, so if you love
someone, tell them, right now.
Text them, call them, email them.
- [Jenn] Happy Birthday, Amy.
You're an adult now.
- Yay, thanks Jenn.
- [Jenn] We just had (speaks
in foreign language).
I asked Amy what she wanted
and she said she wanted this.
- This is always a favorite.
- [Jenn] Yes.
(Mariachi music)
- [Jenn] Bowling right now
and this is honestly the best
I've ever done, you guys.
- [Amy] Wow.
(tick tocking music)
- [Woman In Green] Okay,
sorry, that was me then.
- [Jenn] You guys, check
out this stunning floral
arrangement by The Empty Vase.
They are my favorite florist
in Los Angeles, hands down.
And this is just breathtaking.
It is a very large floral structure
and it almost doesn't really,
I mean it looks so crazy.
It's almost like it's been copied
and pasted onto my kitchen.
I just got back from Sophia's house.
We filmed something for her channel
and I'm really excited
to see how it comes out
because there was choreography involved
and it's just gonna be a really
cool, colorful, quirky video
and I'm excited to see it come together.
But now I'm at home and I'm
dealing with a lot of adult stuff.
Like, I opened my mailbox and literally,
anything that I get in the
mailbox is either stuff
that I need to pay for or spam.
Like, I don't even know how I got
onto this random list for Grandin Road.
I think January or January,
February's a weird time of year
where all mail just gives me
anxiety because it's either
the IRS or the Franchise Tax Board.
That's my dealio right now,
so I'm just dealing with this
so I don't have to think about it anymore.
I'm not a person that puts things off.
If something makes me uncomfortable,
like, I have to deal with it
and confront it because
my worst nightmare is
putting it off and then
forgetting about it
and then getting in trouble.
It is Monday today and I actually have
like a really chill day
and it feels so good.
This past week has been
so nuts and I feel like,
I feel like I was on
the edge of burning out,
but for some reason, I wasn't.
I think it's because
I feel pretty balanced
and I must say this meditation,
therapy, working out
bundle is working out for me pretty well.
I just cross my fingers
and hope to stay stable.
But yes, yesterday, I uploaded
my Q&amp;amp;A video with Ben.
It's going down really well.
I think a lot of you guys are
enjoying it which makes me super happy.
Later on tonight, I'm going
to Emily's house for a
Galentine's Day and that's
gonna be really fun.
I love my girlfriends so
much and I really prioritize
the friendships in my life.
- [Jenn] Oh, my God,
Happy Galentine's Day.
- Happy Galentine's Day.
- [Jenn] Oh, my God, Revela
is cookin' up a feast.
A vegan feast.
Sherry's pourin' the wine.
Wow, we're gonna drink this all tonight.
- [Woman] All of it.
- [Jenn] This looks freaking delicious.
Damn, Sophie, are you gonna eat all that?
- [Sophie] I'll let you know.
- [Jenn] And there's salad.
- [Woman] I'm gonna sit right
next to the everything bagel.
(group speaks in foreign language)
- [Jenn] (speaks in
foreign language) everyone,
it is Tuesday.
I am currently in the car
driving to a couple of meetings.
First is with Fresh and
I'm really stoked because
I love their black tea line,
so I'm excited to see the rest of
the range of the products that they have.
And then I'm doing an interview
which would be really thrilling.
I was gonna say exciting,
but I'm trying to do a different
adjective besides that.
I think I'm kind of finally
getting in the swing of things
with interviews because most interviews,
they kind of ask you the same thing,
they're like how'd you get started,
what kind of videos do you do,
so I can easily talk
about that all day now.
But, it's so crazy,
even like two years ago,
I wouldn't even know how to answer
that question without stuttering.
Last night was so much fun.
We had a Galentine's Day at Emily's
and it was just so sweet that
she cooked for all of us.
I definitely want to return the favor.
I feel like most of the times
when my girlfriends come over,
we just like PostMates
something or we eat out,
but there's nothing like
a home cooked dinner
and she's like inspiring
me to try new recipes
because I only know how
to make like four things
and I would like to expand that
to at least six things, you know?
I think I'm just really spoiled
because Ben does pretty much
all the cooking in the house,
so my cooking skills have
definitely deteriorated.
But I think I'm gonna cook dinner tonight.
I think I'm gonna make kimchi jjigae
because my (speaks in
foreign language), my aunt,
she made this delicious kimchi
I think it's ready to
be turned into a soup.
Kimchi jjigae is best when
the kimchi is a little older
and more fermented, I guess?
I don't know what the word is,
but it's better when it's more dank.
(mellow music)
(mellow music)
- Alright, it is time for dinner
and tonight I am making
kimchi jjigae with tuna.
I bought this can, I wanna
say, a couple months ago
and I know I should use it.
Normally, you're supposed
to make kimchi jjigae
with pork, but since I am
not eating pork anymore,
I am gonna go with good
old fashioned tuna.
And yeah, this tuna is
specifically made for kimchi jjigae
so I'm super excited to try it out.
So, I just grabbed this recipe online
and the first instruction is
to sauté this can of tuna.
Wow, woo, that's red.
And here I have this homemade
kimchi that my aunt made.
Oh my God, this is so
beautiful, look at this.
I haven't even touched this yet.
I've only had maybe like a portion or two
so I'm gonna put this in the stew.
It's gonna be delicious.
Oh my goodness, there is the
finished kimchi jjigae, yum!
And Ben is making fries.
- Chips. Crispy chips tonight.
So English and so Korean.
- [Jenn] I can't wait to
have a little bit of that.
He's gonna have a little bit of this.
- [Ben] Yeah.
- Today is Valentine's Day
and I woke up with this on my bedside.
Ben was off to a early gig today,
so he left me this note.
So, we'll see what's inside.
Aw, this is so cute.
It says &amp;quot;Good morning.&amp;quot;
(laughs) Oh my God, this is
off to a great start already.
Oh my God, what is this (laughs)?
(mellow music)
With (mumbles) again.
We've got a glass of champagne.
- [Ben] Sort of like a prosecco
vodka and blueberry mix.
We tried to copy what Steph
did with our sipping sister.
We didn't have some of the
ingredients, but we did this.
- [Jenn] Yeah, I think it's pretty close.
- It's nice.
Happy Valentine's Day, babe.
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- Oh, wow, that's great, that's fantastic.
I really get some awesome
notes of the vodka.
- I really taste the alcohol.
(Jenn laughs)
- [Jenn] Alright, so, another dish came.
This is the Kale Caesar Salad.
We've got the deviled eggs and a lasagna.
But Ben's in the restroom
right now, somewhere,
so I gotta refrain myself
from eating all this.
- [Man] So, if we want
somewhere in Orange County,
that is kinda like the new hotspot.
- [Cell Phone] Welcome
to day nine of change.
- Hello, I'm shooting with Silas today.
We're doing a little Team Cozy shoot.
- [Silas] You look just
miserable (laughs).
- (laughs) Stop!
(mellow music)
(mellow music)
I think this one is for me.
Look what we have here.
- It's a really sharp box.
- It is (laughs).
- Cute.
- Cute.
- Oh, my god, these are sick.
- They're so platformed.
- I know, I love a little bit of height.
- I love that too, actually.
- This is sick, thank you.
Wow, check these out.
This is Stephanie's seat.
And over here we've got moi.
It's a very recent photo.
I love it.
(mellow music)
(mellow music)
(mellow music)
- [Jenn] At the park I brought Cheeky.
I'm hanging out with Julia.
She brought some snacks for us to eat.
This is her loot.
We've got the roasted
garlic, some hummus, ooh.
- [Julia] Kale pesto.
- [Jenn] I love pesto.
- [Julia] I love Kale, so (laughs).
- [Jenn] Oh, my God, so it works out.
- [Julia] This is great.
I had it the other day.
- [Jenn] We're about to paint.
We're at a paint and sip event.
James is ready to get his paint on.
We've got some colors here.

- Hello, everybody, I am
checking in to say goodbye.
I want to thank you guys
for watching this vlog.
I am gonna continue to record today.
I am going to lunch with The OG Crew,
John, Sarah, and Becka,
and this is what I'm wearing today.
I'm wearing a Finders Keepers
blouse from a long time ago
and Eggie trousers.
It's like 75 degrees
today, beautiful day in LA.
But yeah, leave me down something
in the comments section.
I'm gonna reply to as
many as I possibly can
and I'll see you guys in the next one.
Bye, muah!
