- Hey everyone, it's your girl Jenn,
and welcome to my car.
Today I'm planning the
perfect date for Ben
thanks to Google Assistant
who I've teamed up
for this paid partnership.
Ben and I just love going on picnics
so I thought I would just, you
know, make some Korean food
and we'd head out
together, and I'm gonna use
Google Assistant to help me
plan our little adventure.
What are nearby Korean grocery stores?
- [Google Assistant] I found a few places
within two point seven miles.
- I think I want to go to Zion Market.
Alright.
Let's head on over.
I think I'm gonna try and make kimbap
because my mom always
makes it for our picnics.
But I've actually never made it myself.
Maybe I helped her once when I was a kid
but I really don't remember.
So I think it would be really
fun to make it for Ben.
And then probably some chips
because I love chips and
ooh, Korean pears, oh, those
are so tasty and juicy.
I think they're in season too.
So, we'll find out.
Alright, I've parked, I am
here, and I should probably
figure out how to make kimbap actually.
Kimbap recipe.
Wow, there's so many options.
I think I'm just gonna go for
this recipe right over here.
Perfect.
Alright, we're at the grocery store,
I haven't been here in a hot minute
and oh, I should add Korean
pear to my shopping list.
Add Korean pear to my shopping list.
- [Google Assistant] Okay,
I've added Korean pear
to your shopping list.
(pleasant music)
Okay.
I've gathered everything and
I guess I am on my way home
to make this all.
Okay.
I've got all the ingredients.
And I'm gonna put on the rice first
cause that's gonna take the longest.
I'm just gonna set a timer.
Set timer for 30 minutes.
- [Google Assistant] Okay, 30 minutes.
And that's starting now.
- Yeah, Ben and I try and
go on these little dates
at least once a week.
Whether it's you know,
going on these picnics,
or we go out for dinner.
It just helps you know keep
the relationship on its toes.
- [Ben] Hey babe.
- Hey.
- [Ben] Oh, what you got there?
- I'm making something.
- What are you making?
This looks amazing.
(pleasant music)
- [Jenn] Ta-da!
And we're all set.
(car engine revving)
Alright, now we're at the park.
- Made it.
Look at this.
- [Jenn] Look at our spread.
- [Ben] Delightful little spread.
- [Jenn] We've got kimbap, Korean melon
and a side of kimchi and radish.
- What a lovely day.
- [Jenn] I know.
- We come here a lot.
- [Jenn] We do, we really
really utilize this spot
but this is just a gorgeous place
that's in the middle of L.A.
(groovy music)
- [Ben] It's coming for you.
- Korean melon.
So tasty.
- [Ben] So fresh aren't they?
Did you get a photo of this?
- Yes.
- [Ben] Oh, I've got the phone hang on.
Okay google, take a selfie.
There we go.
(camera shutter clicks)
(groovy music)
- So I'm back home from the picnic
and I'm so happy we did this because
I just feel rejuvenated.
Something about eating outdoors.
And I also feel like
little moments like this
really keep a relationship on its toes
and keeps the spark alive.
I want to thank the Google
Assistant for partnering
with me and making this video possible.
I also want to thank you for watching
and I'll see you guys in the next one.
Bye.
Mwa.
