29th of December 2016 I proposed to Jen
Jen is the most incredible person I've
ever met in my life and basically since
the day I met her I knew I wanted to
spend the rest of my life with her
so as this is only going to happen once
in my life I had to get it right so on
Christmas Day our surprise gender the
two nights vacation at our favorite
hotels tearing their resort
I wanted the first day to be all about
settling in and relaxing and then the
second day is where I take it to a nice
lunch and then proposed to her in the
room afterwards I wanted to document as
much of this experience as I could
because I wanted it to be something that
we could both look back on and I wanted
to share this with my friends family and
of course you guys so please join me on
this journey where I will show you
exactly how I proposed to Jen hey guys
hey guys hello that we are off to a
Terranea Resort me and Jen are having a
romantic couple of nights

months perfectly fair like it's been so
long for me is a long time so let me
take you back a bit me and jellified

creative he's a great videographer and
once I told him what I wanted to do he
was more than happy to be on board
so I told Jim we had the room from the
28th and 29th of December but what she
didn't know is actually booked it's on
the 27th so me and we went down that
morning and our plan was to get
everything set up know what cameras go
where where I'm proposing where she's
going to watch the video and I also
wanted to film an outro for the memory
video of me wearing the same thing I'll
be wearing on the actual day just to
kind of confuse her and throw her off a
little bit so men who had a little work
to do I was joking to follow me and in
the future okay cool I'm kidding I want
to do this any kind of Instagram story

why did he just why'd you go to work
what's not had you can't handle it when
you use the employment they were so
excited I mean they mums been saying for
ages like when you're going to marry her
only because she knows that I never
really spoke to about girls and
relationships and stuff but the second I
met Jen I was like carving up this girl
and she was like what we're having these
conversations as she was so I'm just
measured from Hillary I'm Hillary's the
girl that's helping arrange everything
here she's been amazing
she helped sort the brooms out and the
restaurant and now she's coming to meet
after help plan play we want to shoot
the footage afterwards go into the
restaurant to trump at the camera down
and even helping with the flowers and
the petals down in the room so she is
usually just for the shot or the
backdrop for the place in the room after
lunch I wanted to kind of capture

plant the camera it can even be like
these bushes right here and I could
shoot through the camera onion and I
film over there can be huge for tree so

only going to be with that to thank the
amazing do Hillary and all the staff at
Erin air I was feeling ready

editing software and that I should get
some content over the next couple of
days you know it's something to work on
