I have partnered up with sugar bear hair
to talk all about my hair from the
products the tools I use to keep my hair
as happy and as healthy as I can so
let's get started alright so let's talk
about products now at the top of the
list I have sugar bear hair vitamins and
I put these on top because what you put
inside your body is just as important as
what you put on it and for those who
don't know what sugar bear hair vitamins
are they are a vegetarian supplement
that have specific vitamins that promote
hair benefits like hair growth hair
shine to scalp care and literally all of
my friends have tried this and it's
worked for them so it was about time
that I tried it myself and I'm not gonna
lie at first I was a little skeptical
about it but this is my second ball now
I've been eating these for two months
now and I have noticed a significant
change in my dandruff meaning I have
less of it dandruff is the bane of my
existence
now I don't have to wear a hat so often
anymore as for a hair growth I think
it's a little too soon to tell I feel
like it's growing a little bit faster
but I can't really tell the difference
yet but I know the biotin is working
because my nails have been growing
non-stop I just got a manicure done and
I feel like I am due for a new one I eat
two of these a day because that's the
serving size and honestly on some days I
have to sneak in a cheeky little third
one because they're so damn delicious
you can grab these on their website and
also on Amazon so they're very
accessible and there's also going to be
a giveaway so hit open the description
box to see how you can enter for my
shampoo and conditioner I've been loving
to use this set this is by living proof
and it's their perfect hair day Shampoo
and Conditioner set and this stuff is
amazing for the shampoo I'll just grab a
little quarter size and pull my hand and
then I'll just really scrub my wet scalp
and just get in there you know get all
that dirt and grime out and then I'll go
in with the conditioner I always feel
like I used too much but I feel like
it's a problem that a lot of girls are
guilty of but yeah I'll put a big glob
on to the mid to the end shafts and I'll
just let it chill there
as I'm washing and shaving my body my
hair feels just really clean hydrated
never stripped and it smells amazing and
that's all I can really ask for in a
shampoo and conditioner so after I wash
my hair I have to put a styling cream in
and I've been a massive fan of wines
anti frizz styling cream for years now
and so what I'll do on wet hair is I'll
put like a good quarter sized amount on
each side of my hair and some of you
guys might be thinking whoa that's a lot
of product but don't worry it won't
weigh down your hair at all it dries
very lightweight and the formula is
super moisturizing so there's less frizz
plus when it dries it acts as a heat
protectant as well so you can work on
your hot tools after your hair is all
dry on days I don't wash my hair which
is pretty damn often I use a dry shampoo
and my favorite one is this one by Armco
this one is their death la edition I
believe I'm dry shampoo is very simple
to use all you got to do is section off
your hair and then blast it into the
scalp and then you just rub it with your
fingers until all of it has been
absorbed dry shampoo is amazing at
grabbing all those excess oils and just
giving you a ton of volume into your
hair there are a ton of dry shampoos out
in the market but I always come running
to this one because this one doesn't
leave a white cast so once my hair is
dry it's time to style it and on most
days I'll use dry bars three-day bender
in the 1.25 inch barrel and this guy
works so well with my hair
I have talked about this in multiple
videos now so if you guys have been
watching my channel
this tool is no surprise to you the
curler itself takes some getting used to
because it is a new technique a little
tricky at first but once you get the
process down you're gonna be flying I
can curl my hair super fast with this my
favorite thing about this curler is the
fact that I don't have to curl my hair
every single day
every day kind of leaves my hair with a
new different curl because I don't wash
my hair every day so on day one when
it's freshly curled I just have these
really beautiful sleek defined curls and
then when I sleep on my hair very gently
day 2 I'm left with a little bit more of
a relaxed curl you know something more
subtle and then if I make it to day 3 it
just ends up looking like a really nice
subtle blowout curl it once and then dry
shampoo in between the days
I have a different hairstyle for all
three days another favorite hair tool of
mine is this ancient Conair artifact I
believe I got this in college maybe even
before college so this has been with me
for a really long time I believe this is
the curling wand I use for my very very
first hair styling video so yeah we've
come a long way with this guy I always
use this curling wand when I'm looking
for more of an effortless beachy look
when maybe when I've air dried my hair
and I'm just looking to define the front
two pieces of my hair or if I'm doing
pigtails I'll also use this curling wand
to do just like the pieces of hair that
are falling out this is just like my
go-to curling wand
when I'm going for something more casual
if the ends of my hair are looking a
little rough hair oil is definitely a
must and I've been loving to use ways
hair oil all I'll do is add you know
couple drops on the palm of my hand warm
it up so I can just kind of really
distribute the product evenly into my
hair you can also use this on wet hair
if you just want to start that smoothing
process immediately and you definitely
don't need a lot of this stuff a couple
of drops will do this is going to smooth
and tame the frizz away and it's just a
little nice hair care step to do let's
move on over to texturizing spray my
all-time favorite to use has been or
obeys dry texturizing spray this stuff
is amazing at giving me that volume that
I want I'll spray saw my hair right now
to show you the difference okay so I
feel like look at that difference I feel
like it adds at least like an inch to
your hair this is all so amazing to
spray on day one hair when it's a little
bit more slippery and hard to manage
when you spray this texturizing spray it
gives it more grit and you're able to
style it the way you want it to another
texturizing spray that I have to shout
out is dry bars triple sec this stuff is
pretty much identical to or BAE
but I feel like this is lighter and it
smells different this one smells like
vanilla to me oh it smells so good
I feel like this one is better for day
to day three here when your hair already
has that grit in it this is great if you
just want volume alright guys we have
come to the last product we're talking
about hair masks now here I have whens
renoise hydrating hair mask in the scent
bamboo green tea and this one smells so
good it smells like Japanese candy
I wish my hair could just smell like
this all the time but I use a hair mask
every week or every time I remember but
whenever I use a hair mask I have to use
this one because it just leaves my hair
so silky so smooth so what I do is on
wet hair I'll you know put a glob I'll
comb it through and then I'll get a
shower cap and I'll tuck all my hair in
it and then I'll chill for an hour I'll
just you know go about my day and do
some emails or watch TV whatever and
after an hour I will rinse it and my
hair just feels so much smoother so much
softer after using this and this is
always a must in my haircare arsenal the
number one hair question I get asked all
the time is what color is your hair and
if I'm going to be honest I have a lot
of trouble describing what color it is
because it really depends on the
lighting to the filter I use but if I
had to come up something concrete it
would be a light chestnut brown with
hints of Auburn if that's even a color
but basically I have been getting my
hair cut and colored by my friend Anna
Lee she is amazing I've been going to
her for around three years now I have
been loving my hair journey with her I
will leave her contact info in the
