to get back into it but so fun but we're

oh hey everyone
I believe today is Sunday sorry I'm just
like not my usual perky self just a lot
has happened in the last 24 hours
yes Ben broke his wrist in two places
after some skier cut him off and it's
just so unfortunate because is literally
at the last slope this is the first time
anyone so close to me has gotten hurt
and I always going to be fine I thank
God he didn't fall and got paralyzed it
could have been so much worse but it's
regardless I'm just I don't know just
really nervous because we have to get a
CT scan this week to see if he needs
surgery I hope he doesn't but I'm
definitely a pessimist in some ways
because I just have a feeling he's got a
knee surgery I'm just trying to stay
positive and um I don't know I did I
almost wish that I broke my wrist
instead um anyway um oh my gosh don't
know why I'm getting so emotional okay
snap out of it okay so today's our last
day in Tahoe luckily Silas and Cole are
going to help me film and shoot my
winter lookbook so we had been shot to
office before but they're gonna help me
film the last three outfits so I'm
really really grateful for that I know
everything's gonna be okay I just I just
need time to like process everything and
I just I don't know what else to say I
just feel like my brains scrambled eggs
right now
all right what's up guys I'm back in LA
yesterday I didn't get to vlog too much
because just a lot of stuff had happened
it was just mostly a day of travel it
was really really tough on Ben because
it was just constant moving on his wrist
and the painkillers that the urgent care
gave us clearly not strong enough
because they didn't do much for him but
he pulled through we landed around 9
o'clock and right after we landed went
home dropped off our bags and then I
drove out to the OC Chiqui because of
Boo and TIFF we're taking care of her
all the time everything was done it was
midnight I was beyond shattered it's
just so crazy how traveling just drains
everything out of you even though you're
literally just sitting I'm working with
Goodwill today and I would have just
pushed this back but my rough cuts due
on Wednesday so I have to film this
today but to give me like a day to edit
everything I don't know it's good that
I'm out and about and working because if
I'm just at home with Ben I'm just gonna
be like sulking going to my home town to
go to my old good well that means there

of like a throwback goodwill haul today

yeah look at that smile guys I
completely killed that what's up guys
I'm here is just end vlog I'm actually
recording this on December 15th so this
is as recent as it's going to get I just
wanted to update you guys on why jungle
bells was so late I just had a bunch of
projects in between and I only work off
my laptop and so storage is limited and
so when I'm editing these jungle bells
it takes up like 50 gigs of memory and I
didn't have that space in order to edit
this and I had to prioritize some other
videos first and so that explains why
it's a little late it's mid December and
the first jungle bells is going up but
you know what better late than never
if you guys enjoyed it please like the
video subscribe to my channel and become
a gem today I'll see you guys in the
next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
