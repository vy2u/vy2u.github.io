have a summer haul for you all the
pieces are from my clothing line Aggie
and I'm so proud that we just dropped
our summer collection yesterday and so
this video is just gonna be a breakdown
of me explaining each piece one by one
breaking it down and this is one of my
favorite collections because summer is
my season and there are so many little
bits they can rock to any occasion that
you might find yourself this summer so
let's get started so we're gonna start
with dresses first because there's a lot
of them I swear we have a dress for any
occasion or any type of girl you are we
have a dress for you and the first one
is called the poppy dress this is a
floral mini--length dress with a ruffled
edge neckline and a ruffled edge hem
this can be worn two ways you can either
put the ruffles up for like a cute
v-neck moment or you can push them down
for an off-the-shoulder
florals are a must for the summer and so
I'm really stoked that we made this
custom floral print and that's why
you're gonna see it incorporated in a
lot of other styles in this collection
this is the peony dress this is a sweet
pink little number with another ruffled
edge neckline this is off the shoulder
of course but these have two adjustable
belt straps that keep the whole dress in
place this is just like an easy little
dress to pop on for a lunch or a summer
date with the girls now this dress is
called the Gretel I this is just another
off the shoulder mini dress but it's
form-fitting and it hugs the body in all
the right places there are these
beautiful billowy sleeves and it just
has like an aura of elegance to it I'm
still obsessed with the color red so of
course we had to make this stunning a
rose dress this is a surprise another
off the shoulder dress but it's
different because the sleeves are kind
of puffy and structured and this is just
like another feminine vibrant number to
stand out in so this is the mint chip
dress I absolutely love soft minty
colors like this so of course I don't
make a dress in this color it's in a
really comfy
ribbed material and it has one bow in
the chest and the other near the stomach
you can make the bows as tight or as
loose as you want so it's totally
adjustable to your size this dress is
called wrapped up I am rocking the
cobalt blue but it also comes in a coral
this is just your classic mini dress
silhouette it's got adjustable spaghetti
straps and it has this cute crossbody
wrap so you can make a bow on your left
hip I love ruffles and so we made this
really fun coral dress called the orchid
it's got the ruffle strap details all
around and a cute sweetheart neckline I
love that it's an a-line so it's flowy
and flirty and I just I'm just like
obsessed with this coral shade so this
is probably my favorite dress in the
collection and this is called the
Magnolia it's just like a flowy white
little dress with the smocked waist and
puffed shoulders there are two ways you
can wear the shoulders you can just wear
it up or down depending if you want your
shoulders exposed or not the last dress
I have for you is called the yarrow this
is a simple classy but sassy dress it's
super fresh looking and I love that it
has these buttons that run across the
dress the sleeves are 3/4 length and
they have this lovely black trimming on
it so now that we're done with the
dresses let's move on over to the tops
this is the party mom shirt this is like
an inside joke that happened a while
back because I mean every group has one
they have there's that one person that
just parties super responsibly is making
sure that everyone's okay and everyone
got home safe
and honestly every group should have a
party mom but regardless I thought that
this would inspire in this party mom
movement if we made some shirts about it
so here we have just a classic tee with
this print party mom it's in like this
3d puffy paint and it's just fun to have
your together and party responsibly
and of course we've got the party dad
shirt we couldn't leave any guys out it
is in the color black and I feel like
the paint and the lettering really
contrasts well these come in standard
men's sizing so I'm wearing an extra
small in the clip so just sized
accordingly that way next up I have the
eggy long sleeve this is a spin off on
those old-school day
shirts that we used to have this comes
in two colorways it's the speech one
that I'm rocking here but it also comes
in this lovely block so you choose
whatever speaks to you most now we have
the Chas this is a cropped oversized
button-up tee with a bunch of stripes
I love button downs and how wretched
they look this comes in two colorways
and it's in this nice loose fit now here
I have the crop it hoodie I wanted to
include some pieces where you can you
know wear on summer nights out when it
gets a little cooler but this is just
like a cropped hoodie with embroidery
detail lining on the pockets this comes
in two colors white and red next up we
have the Helana top this is a really
trendy white scrunched crop top the
section around the chest is super
stretchy and the sleeves are puffy and
romantic this is another super soft
white top and this is called B Belle
blouse I love how comfortable this top
is it's really lightweight and it has
these cute buttons all around and it's
just finished with this like adorable
lettuce trimming this top is gonna have
you feeling like a princess for sure so
this next top is called the Regal and
it's super fancy feeling it's a knit
long sleeve with a little cold shoulder
action there's this really unique
triangle drape on the shoulders and the
front and back and it's just a really
beautiful top that you can wear when you
want to show a little bit of skin but
still stay reserved so this next top is
actually a bodysuit and it's in that
same custom floral print from the poppy
dress but I just love that it's cute and
flirty and of course it's off the
shoulder I love that it's a bodysuit so
it's super easy to tuck under everything
I am in love with this next blouse this
is the Amelie and it's kind of like a
modern casual corset because of the lace
details in the front the sleeves are
kind of loose so they're meant to like
fall down but since the chest is so
tight like it's gonna keep you covered
now this white top is a lot more casual
it's got like a full lace detail in the
front and it finishes off of the bow I
love the hook and eye clasp and they're
functional so you can wear open or
closed depending on how you're feeling
so this is the last top and it's called
the daffodil
is a one shoulder bust with an oversized
rail on the side it's in this like
really fun yellow striped fabric that is
perfect for the summer and I can't wait
to rock it more on days where I want to
just feel more jazzed up so now we are
moving on to the jumpsuits and matching
sets and the first jumpsuit I have is
called the Camila this is gonna make you
look like a delicious snack at your
favorite picnic spot this is in a beige
gingham print and it's got a large bow
on the front it's got pockets on the
sides and the fit is nice and cropped
now we have the Jasmine set this is also
in that cute gingham print and I love
that this can be worn in three ways
first you can just rock it as a halter
with the straps around your neck or you
can take the straps off and tie them
across your chest and a knot and the
last way you can wear Ock is you can tie
the straps in the back for a more clean
minimal look there are also the bottoms
which are high-waisted and they have
like a little triangle cutout in the
front you can buy this as a set or
separately depending if you want to mix
and match I am wearing the yellow
version right now and I am rocking it
with the straps on the back and I just
love how clean and minimal it looks the
last jumpsuit I have is called the iris
and this is in a light wash denim and
I'm obsessed with this color it's a
halter so you just tie the straps around
your neck and your back is exposed this
is also high-waisted and it cinches a
perfect spot and of course I had a slap
on some pockets on the jumpsuit for some
functionality so now if we've reached
the bottoms and so the first pair of
jeans that I want to show you are the
misty denim these are in a medium wash
and they're super high-waisted mom jeans
they come a little oversized because I
wanted to make sure that they feel like
relaxed now I've got the Morning Glory
skirt this comes in two colors in a
light wash and the other is in white and
this is just like a a wine denim skirt
it's got cool lacing details on the
sides and I love like the little metal
details that it has this is just like a
super cute skirt that you can wear with
the graphic tee or just any basic on top
so here I'm rocking the white striped
shorts these are high waisted and I love
the black and white pattern it's got
like a really interesting layer detail
so it's kind of like an origami cut so
next up I've got the white striped pants
this is kind of like the shorts but just
revamped it to a pant these are very
body hugging and I love the little cross
wraps that hook for your hips you can
just tie them together to create some
cute little knots and these are so
fashion-forward and definitely not for
the faint of heart now we have the
oxford shorts these are just like in a
nice blue wash denim and they've got
like a panel around the belt loops these
are kind of stretchy so they're comfy
they will become your go-to short for
sure the last item we have is the beige
base skirt now this is actually a skort
so it's very very practical it is
neutral so it'll go with everything and
it's just a fun way to show a little leg
but you still have a lot of freedom so
those are all the items in my edgy haul
I can't wait to see these pieces on you
and if you guys are interested in
shopping feel free to open the
description box because I'll put
