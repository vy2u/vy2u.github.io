another what would Jen wear and I know
I've been filmed this in several months
but you guys requested it so here it is
again for those who don't know what it
is its segment where you tweet me your
fashion dilemma and I tell you best to
answer it so let's start with the first
tweet
Stephanie Tan asks what would you pair
with bra let's with without being too
sexy but facing this dilemma for a while
now I thought this would be a fun
dilemma for me to do because with bra
let's I didn't really even think about
how sexy or revealing they could be I
mean usually when I wear a bra let I'll
just wear it under like a low-cut top or
even for sure one I thought it would be
challenging for me to style it in a
modest way so this is what I came up
with I styled this white bra let because
it has this really gorgeous lacing on
the bottom so that's why I decided to
wear it with a cropped sweater that way
the lace peeks out in a sexy but
tasteful way and since the sweater is
cropped I went ahead and wore some
high-waisted mom jeans and then I wanted
to jazz up the outfit by keeping a
printed coat over my shoulders and then
accessorized with some silver jewelry
next up I have a question from Darlene
how do you pack a fedora / larger hat
when traveling without ruining it when
I'm packing a hat I either have two
options and it really depends on what
kind of hat is on let's say I'm packing
this one as you can see this one's quite
stiff it doesn't want to lose its shape
so I'll just pop this on my head and
just wear to the airport go through TSA
all that goodness and once I get to my
seat I'll just either pop it on my lap
or just under the seat in front of me
and that's just the way it goes it's
kind of a nuisance but I would rather
have a hat at my end destination than
not have one at all the second option is
to travel with a hat that has more
flexibility this one travels with me
everywhere because of how like bendy it
is so I'll usually just kind of squash
my hat like this and as you can see it
kind of looks like a little taco and
then I'll just kind of watch it inside
my suitcase and then when I get to the
end destination it just pops back into
its normal shape I mean this is the
ideal situation
so just I guess go to your hat store and
just see what kind of hats been like
this and you're good to go
moving on Jenny asks what would you wear
when you're feeling the bumpiest but
don't want to look like a bum so what
I'm having an off day and I don't want
to spruce anything up I'll just wear
pieces of clothing that are really
really soft for example this is what I
came up with everything that I'm wearing
in this outfit is stupidly soft I wish
you could feel how soft these sweatpants
are these are just unreal I paired the
pants with an ultra soft graphic tee and
then I added a cap to hide any greasy
strands and I even threw on these huge
sunglasses just in case you don't have
the time to put any eye makeup and then
for shoes I'm wearing my Nike Roshi's
for ultimate comfort and I think this is
just a great lazy Monday outfit the next
question comes from thousand bodies and
they asked I'm kind of an outfit
repeater and my friends are giving me
 for it loll any tips let's make
this clear there is absolutely nothing
wrong with wearing the same outfit over
and over you spend good money on it you
have every right to wear as many times
as you want
Micah is telling me that your friends
are probably just joking and they don't
actually care that you're wearing the
same outfit but let's say this is truly
bothering you but you still want to wear
the same clothes I would say you should
just try in style and experiment with
the same clothes but with different
things maybe with accessories you can
add a chunky necklace you can throw on a
hat maybe a beret a Brewery looks good
with anything in my opinion or if you
don't have any clothing options /
accessories to play around with you can
do your hair and makeup differently and
that way it looks different but you're
still wearing the same thing Bukit
tweeted I've got brown thigh high boots
but I don't know how to sell them I kind
of use these thigh high boots that look
Brown in certain lights they're more of
like a grayish Brown a taupe some would
say but I thought these would work for
this example since thigh high boots are
a statement on their own I went for a
black and white color scheme for this
look I went for a fitted Strep
turtleneck and this cute black skirt
with buttons in the front and to finish
off the look I added some
gold sunglasses to kind of go with the
warm tones from the brown next up ELISA
asks how would you style a faux fur coat
I just got one and obsessed but unsure
how to style it effortlessly I know that
a faux fur coats can come off very glam
and excessive but there is a way to
style them casually and my favorite way
to do that is to just style them with
the graphic tee
I feel like graphic tees just go with
everything there's something very
effortless about them and I'm wearing
this one it's black and white and it's
kind of like a playoff on Sonic Youth's
panties but they made it really fashion
friendly by a day and a winter and coral
on it I put on a little newsboy cap to
give it more of an Edie Sedgwick vibe
and then since there's a lot going on I
just streamlined everything with some
black skinnies and some black platforms
and if you're short like me you're
probably gonna want to wear heels
because a faux fur coat can look quite
top-heavy so you're gonna want to
balance that out by adding some height
underneath you the last question comes
from LA and she asked tomorrow is my
birthday I'm gonna celebrate this
weekend and I'm curious to know what
would Jen wear for a girls night out
first off happy birthday I'm sure by the
time that I filmed and I've uploaded
this worth they had passed but I thought
I would wish you a very belated birthday
anyway I hope that it was a blast now
going back to your question this is the
outfit I would have worn to like a
birthday bash or even if it was my
birthday
I feel like when you're with your girls
they're less judgmental with what you're
wearing because they understand trends
they understand what's going on so
that's why I'm wearing full-blown
sequins and since the dress is quite
low-cut and loose I wore a lacy Brella
to avoid any unwanted slips I kept my
accessories minimal by adding a delicate
silver necklace and then I just wore my
classic nude platforms
alright guys so that's a wrap on this
episode if you would like to be featured
in the next foot with January you can
tweet me your fashion dilemma at i'm jen
m and ask me a question and just use the
hashtag WWJ w and i might just answer it
