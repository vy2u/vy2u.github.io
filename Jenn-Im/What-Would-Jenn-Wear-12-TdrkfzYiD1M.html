we have a brand new episode of what with
Jen where and if you're new here this
segment is where you tweet me or fashion
dilemma and I answer them using the
items in my wardrobe and if you enjoy
fashion Q&amp;amp;A like this make sure you
subscribe to my channel the button
should be somewhere down below so with
that said let's get started with the
first dilemma the first question comes
from Alisha she asks how to style the
fishnet trend I've been saying this
fishnet trend spiked up on my instagrams
past few months and this is one of my
favorite ways to pair this tricky piece
of hosiery I've gone for something more
polished because fishnets can look a
little messy sometimes I have this
drifted satin coat from Goodwill and I
actually really love the oversized
shoulders because it gives it kind of
like a retro high-fashion vibe
underneath I wore a plain black
turtleneck and then I rocked this true
blue denim skirt to add a pop of color
personally I love when I pair of
fishnets with a miniskirt because you
just get the most out of the pattern
I've added a white Western belt to cinch
the waist and I popped on e Pierce beret
for some edgy class
the next question comes from Ileana how
do I stop Ajay my inspired pieces
without looking like I just got out of
bed I recently got this amazing pajama
set and I thought it would be perfect
for this question this is super
comfortable and I love the pattern print
but with a few tweaks you can really
make it look like you stepped out of a
runway instead of your bed frame I made
to look more tailored by cooking in the
shirt and then cinching the waist with
the drawstring and then I pulled up the
sleeves so I've got some skin peeking
through little details like this make it
look like a jumpsuit instead of a comfy
PJs I've added some bringing accessories
like these chrome sunglasses room key
and these bauble earrings from forever
21 so the third dilemma comes from Vina
I've been in love with the show Daria
lately how would you recreate Darkness
outfit so it wouldn't look to be
anyone's crazy I've actually never seen
an episode of Daria I've always wanted
to but when I was a kid and it was
airing it was always playing around 1
a.m. 2 a.m. and by then the TV was also
parents made me go to sleep so I never
actually seen an episode but this
question just reminded me that I need to
start it and just kind of make up for
lost time but this is the best outfit I
could come up for this question I
actually don't own any green outerwear
so I thought that's this olive farmer
was the closest thing it gives it more
of a sporty feel to make it look less
geeky underneath I'm wearing the only
orange item in my closet and then I
tucked it underneath to start didn't
skirt I think Daria wears off Martin so
I just went for some buckle boots from
public desire and then lastly for frames
I'm wearing these new ones from coconuts
and I can't wait to get them prescribed
because I think they're gonna be my new
favorite frame question number four is
what do you do if you feel
self-conscious about your body what do
you wear so when I'm not feeling my body
this is the type of out that I go for I
like to wear just like a really loose
dress and when I'm feeling uncomfortable
like I just hate wearing pants I hate
letting my legs in and hate buttoning up
so wearing like a loose dress always
makes me feel just a little bit more
comfortable
I wore a lightweight denim jacket just
to give it some more layers because this
dress is pretty plain on its own are
some white tennis shoes to keep
everything comfortable and
to hide any greasy air I think this is a
really easy outfit that can rock on days
where you don't exactly feel 100 next up
we've got Britt she asks Han style
bootcut denim jeans effortlessly but
still of chic so I've never actually
been the type to like bootcut jeans but
2017 has proved me otherwise so this is
my outfit incorporating this type of
change since the bottoms are a little on
the wider side I made sure to wear
something very fitted for my top then
for outerwear I threw on this massive
coat from JOA and this coach makes me
wish that LA got a little bit colder
because then this coat would make sense
I got a little hot in this coat but I
wore it for the speaker to look for
accessories I wore these huge hoops to
add a little glimmer and that's who felt
to coordinate all right so I've saved
the most interesting questions for the
last whatever you're a favorite art
piece use that as your color palette to
create a fashion inspired look to it
okay I just love this question I think
it's so creative so if you guys have
been following my channel for a while
you know that one of my favorite artists
is rene magritte is one of the founders
of surrealism and I just think so much
of his work is dope I decided to
recreate this photo and right over here
this is just really creepy it's trippy
and it's one of those images that just
kind of really stuck in my head from
like my teenage years pretty much so
instead of being inspired by this book I
just literally full-on recreated it I
threw on this tailored blazer from the
kugels and underneath I wore this
cropped turtleneck in a beige shade to
match the color scheme the painting
doesn't show his bottom half but I'm
just going to assume that it brings me
dark so I wore these pants and the shoe
combo to match the gold on frame I wore
my Jenny Byrd earrings and then I picked
out my grapes of wrath' book because it
was the only turquoise book on my
bookshelf honestly I had so much fun
recreating this outfit that I think I'm
going to do like an entire video
recreating art pieces so if you guys

a comment down below I can gauge your
interest or if you want to tweet me your
