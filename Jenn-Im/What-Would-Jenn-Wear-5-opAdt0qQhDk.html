fifth episode of what would Jen wear if
you're just tuning in what would Jen
wear is a segment where you tweet me
your fashion dilemma and I try my best
to answer them in this episode so the
first tweet comes from Maya what is a
great outfit to wear on road trips if I
end up sightseeing I don't want to look
awful in sweats and a G heart heart so
Maya let me tell you a little secret
maxi dresses are just as comfy as sweats
but you end up looking really fantastic
and chic and the greatest thing about a
maxi dress is that you can cross your
legs and squat or whatever in a method
rest because the material is really
stretchy and Samana to Jersey and for
extra comfort I wore these sandals and I
think they're great to slip in and out
of in case you don't want to be that
person who's fumbling out of the car and
struggling with laces and shoes to jazz
up the plain maxi dress I layered some
loose necklaces that just add a slight
pop of color and then I thrown the straw
hat to cover up any greasy strands so
the next week comes from Leah she asks
what heels are you wear if your
boyfriend is pretty short and you can't
wear your collection of five-inch
Jeffrey Campbell heels so believe it or
not I do own shoes that are a monster
height like 5 and 7 inches I do have
modest heights as well like 2 to 3 these
are my recent pair of really cute and
simple heels
I think these are perfect if you're
going on a casual date with your
boyfriend you don't want to tower over
him for my outfit I wore a romantic dark
floral and flowy top and paired it with
some thrifted black shorts I really like
how my black shorts are a little bit
more distressed so it's a good contrast
from the feminine top next up we've got
a tweet from Sabina she asks I have a
red oversized cardigan but don't know
how to style it obviously I paired this
cardigan with dark colors because I
wanted the red to really pop and stand
out for my top I picked out my rat banty
because it has subtle hints of red on
the graphic it's a cool juxtaposition of
a grimy metal banty with a soft and cozy
neck for shoes I wore some comfy flats
that are woven with neutral colors so
that way doesn't really clash with the
red moving on
so salvia
I have a pair of cool holographic
creepers I only pair them with black
clothes but I want to bring some color
in help
I don't own a pair of holographic
creepers but I do have these holographic
chunky sandals I thought that they would
get my point across to be honest I love
pairing holographic pieces with subdued
items the holographic is such a flashy
and flamboyant piece so I want all the
attention to go on that instead so I
went with neutral outfit items like this
oversized white top and these lacy black
shorts and I thought I'd incorporate
colors with my accessories like my
rainbow polarized sunglasses and purple
lip michelle asks this isn't really a
fashion question but how do you wear
sunglasses without leaving a mark on the
bridge of your nose honestly every time
I wear sunglasses I'm left with two
indentations right here as well and so I
thought I'd bring this question up to
the table if anyone in the internet
world has any tips and tricks of
preventing this feel free to comment
down below if not I think that it's safe
to say that we all suffer from it and if
you see someone with little marks here
you're not gonna make fun of them you're
just gonna be like they probably just
took off their sunglasses so I wouldn't
worry too much about it but if someone
does have a solution please comment down
below cuz I would love to know the next
week comes from named she tweets lost a
lot of weight and everything I have is
way too big for me now how do i style
things that are too big gratulations on
the weight loss I know losing weight can
be such a huge ordeal and I'm really
proud of you for adapting a healthier
lifestyle so I would say that bottoms
like pants short skirts are kind of a
lost cause now you can try your best to
belt them all but come on girl you
deserve to treat yourself and get
yourself some nice fitting bottoms I
mean you also got weight so it's really
good to showcase your new body and feel
good about it tops on the other hand are
totally salvageable my favorite way to
deal with an oversized tee is to just
tie it up I just grab the extra fabric
and create a little simple knot with it
and that way you can really show off
your silhouette this is the last tweet
she asks I'm having a difficult time
thinking of a way to make chunky
platform boots look casual for daytime
help an easy way to style a chunky
platform boot is to pair it with some
casual things it's pretty
straightforward just pair it with like
jeans and a t-shirt as usual I'm wearing
no color because I'm in that phase I'm
wearing a slouchy gray crop top and I
love that the sleeves are slightly
folded and then I paired it with some
acid-wash skinnies and to make it even
more relaxed I added my snapback I think
it adds like a hint of tomboy charm to
the outfit and for a day purse option I
added this nice putter one so I can
chuck all my belongings and have them in
check we get a chunky platform boot with
cutouts I think it would make them the
ideal casual daytime shoe so those are
all the questions I picked out for this
specific episode if you're wondering how
the hell is when I get my fashion
dilemma onto an episode all you to do is
tweet at I'm Jen M and tell me your
fashion dilemma and make sure you use
the cash tag WWJ W so I can find it if
you're interested in any of the pieces

linked everything as usual and if you

you in a bit bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
