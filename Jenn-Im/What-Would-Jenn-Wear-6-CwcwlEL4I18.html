we're number six safe y'all so whatever
you want to call it if you're just
tuning in what would Jen where is a
series where you tweet me your fashion
questions slash dilemmas and I reply so
let's get into it the first tweet comes
from Rosie B and she asks what would
John wear to a day at an amusement park
I would keep things very simple and
comfortable if I'm going to amusement
park
chances are you gonna go in the morning
so it's just gonna heat up during the
day so I opted for a really flowy and
big shirt with a smiley face on it
I chucked on a brown parka which is
lightweight but it's gonna keep you warm
once it cools down at night and plus you
get splashed by water ride it's also
gonna help you keep warm I'm wearing a
snapback because you want to protect
your face from getting burned for shoes
I'm wearing these really sensible short
black boots for a bag option I have this
black purse it's a really lightweight
material because a lot of purses the
material is what makes it heavy but for
this bag it's really lightweight and
very flexible so you can just kind of
open it and close it and find all your
things without having to like pry it
open so it's quite nice second tweet
comes from Deborah and she asks if you
are a cartoon character and could only
wear one outfit for the rest of your
life I love this question because it's
so unique this is what I would wear if I
were a cartoon character I chose to sell
fit because it would be really easy to
draw because it's just a triangle you
know I chose a neon dress because it's
gonna really pop on the screen so you
know when I'm you know making my cameo
I'd be wearing my beret
because I think it's one of my signature
hat moves and for shoes just wearing
these big white flat forms with buckles
Carla tweeted what - where - outside
lands you will find soon enough because
this girl is going and so I think I'm
gonna do an entire video on what I'm
gonna wear for outside lands so stay
tuned for that and if any of you guys
are going to the festival and you guys
see me please do not be scared to say hi
I would love to meet you next up Cathy
tweets what would you start with the
plain black t-shirt dress that's above
the knees keep in mind I'm kind of short
- thanks
I am very short as well I'm 5 foot 1 so
a field pain and I don't let my height
stop me from wearing whatever the hell I
want to and so for this outfit I'm
styling my black t-shirt dress from
brandy melville and I decided to wear it
with some denim shorts in case I don't
want to just have it as a flowy material
what I like to do is get the extra
fabric from the shirt and tuck it into
the pocket of the shorts I think it
creates a really effortless and drapey
look to any outfit and then I decided to
layer some cool long necklaces to
elongate my body and make it look like a
moment taller the next tweet comes from
Jessica and she asks how to look modern
vintage grandpa / grandma chic now
that's a lot of different themes you're
asking for but this is the best I came
up with I think what makes an outfit
look really vintage is clashing patterns
you're going to mix them up and this
cardigan is one of my oldest thick dip
pieces and I really like the way it
matches and mixes with the floral
printed top underneath the grandma
element comes from the bottom half of
the outfit these shoes and socks combo
makes it look quite mature the final
question comes from Celine ideas got an
outfit to wear to an art exhibition last
show something that'll be formal enough
yet still be quirky I think I found a
nice balance between being formal and
still maintaining my Flair by throwing
on a pink blazer the colour is loud and
fun but at the end of the day it's still
a blazer so it's got the structure and
the formality I've done the same thing
with the button-up it's formal because
of the shape but the print is what makes
it fun and whimsical I opted for some
shredded black skinnies and throw on
Steph shoes because she helped me film
this and I forgot to pack big fat black
tall boots so she let me borrow hers so
Thank You Stephanie
from my hair I just wrapped it up into a
big bun and if you're wondering how I
made that big bun with my short hair I
basically didn't wash it for three or
four days and I just blasted it with dry
shampoo and so it made it really
voluminous
and it basically did whatever I told it
to so it kind of worked I just put a lot
of bobby pins and just kind of stayed
anyway that's it for this segment of
what would Jenna wear if you want me to
continue the segment please give a
thumbs up mean so much to me and if
you're wondering how
you can have your question featured all
you gotta do is tweet me at i'm gern em
with the hashtag www and just ask me a
question and I might answer it I'm a
little frantic right now because I'm
heading out to Shanghai tomorrow and I'm
so excited especially for the food I'm
also having a meet and greet so if you
live in Shanghai and you're somehow
