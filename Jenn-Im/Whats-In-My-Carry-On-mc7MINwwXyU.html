- Hi, everyone!
Welcome back to my channel.
Today I have partnered with Dr.Jart
to show you what I pack in my carry-on.
I would say that I travel quite a bit
and I feel like I finally mastered down
what I need to take with me
when I'm up on that plane.
I know that traveling can be so stressful.
There's lines, there's
anxiety, but I feel like
the best way to calm that
stress is by being prepared.
So here are my necessities
for my carry-on.
My carry-on is from Calpak
and I'm obsessed with the champagne color.
I always feel so chic and
sleek carrying this guy around.
It also matches my bigger case,
and I love that it just comes in a set.
So, let's crack that baby
open and get started.
This is my toiletry case
that I got a few years ago
and I love the first
aid cross on the front
and the fact that it's lined with rubber.
So when things explode in here, it's okay.
I gotta have my little
tub of face cleanser.
I like using this small container
because it's travel
friendly and I can squeeze
whatever cleanser in
here and be on the go.
Essence is a must, I've
been using this for my face
for the past four years.
And honestly I think it's the reason why
my complexion is the way it is.
I actually need to get
another travel-size bottle
because this one's running pretty low.
During overnight flights I need
some extra loving for my skin.
I love packing these masks from Dr.Jart.
This is their Cicapair Tiger Grass
Nightly Re.Pair Mask.
And they're very convenient on the go.
You just rip it open,
apply it all over the face
and just let it sink in.
The key ingredient in this
line is Centella Asiatica,
which is also known as tiger grass.
It gets its nickname
because tigers in Asia
used to roll around in it
to soothe their wounds.
This overnight mask is amazing
for soothing redness while you sleep
and you can grab it at Sephora.
I always travel with
my electric toothbrush
because it works for a good week
without having to charge it.
Then I have my toothpaste,
I love this one from Colgate
because it just keeps
my breath extra minty.
When you're traveling, you
pick up a lot of germs,
so I love to pack these little hand wipes
in case I don't have any
access to clean water.
It's also really great to
use to wipe down your seat.
Next up, I'm moving on to makeup.
I'm only gonna show you
the bare minimum products
that I bring on the flight with me.
First, I have my Dr.
Jart Cicapair Tiger Grass
Color Correcting Treatment.
This is an all in one
color correcting product
that hides redness and
preps skin for makeup.
I like to use this to
even out any red tones
on my face and this line
is aimed for everybody
but specifically for
those who have redness,
rosacea, sensitivity, and acne.
I gotta pack concealer,
this one has been my
favorite to use at the moment.
It's easy to pop underneath
the eyes or around the nose.
So that way my skin looks
fresh out of the plane.
I can't forget my brows.
Until I get them micro-bladed
a brow pencil is a must.
My lips always get so dry when I travel.
This universal salve
from Glossier is awesome
to put on lips and any other areas
that get dry like the
knuckles and cuticles.
Now, let's move onto important
stuff you can not lose.
This is a separate case where I keep
all my important travel documents.
Like my passport, a pen to fill out forms,
medication in case I get
sick, and my boarding pass.
I like putting all of this
stuff in one container
so that way I'm not frantically
fishing around for it in my purse.
Okay, now for technology.
These are my must have tech gadgets.
I gotta pack my laptop, of course.
I'm always working,
even when I'm traveling.
And my laptop is a must
so I can hustle 24/7.
Can't forget the charger,
I've forgotten my
laptop charger too many times to count.
Speaking of chargers,
bring your phone charger.
I like to keep it in
this blue squishy case
so it's easier to find.
Next up, I've got my vlogging cameras.
Here I have my Canon t3i,
this is the main camera
that I use my vlogs
with and I don't really
have a case for it so I
just stuff it in a beanie.
Then I have my Canon g7x,
this is for evening footage
and if I happen to carry
a purse that doesn't fit
my bigger one, I'll just use this.
Headphones, this is
possibly the most important
must have for flying.
This is my favorite way
to deal with long lines
and waiting periods at the airport.
Reading on the plane has been
my favorite way to pass the time.
I love how light weight this
is and the fact that I can
carry thousands of books
with me with just one tablet.
I highly recommend getting one.
I like to stay comfortable
and these are the
things that keep me cozy
and sleepy on the plane.
There's nothing worse than
getting off a plane with a
stiff neck and it's
really hard to get sleep
when your neck is
resting on your shoulder.
That's why this neck
pillow has been amazing.
It keeps your neck nice and snug
and honestly when I pop
this on I just knock out.
I swear there's always a
screaming baby on the plane
or there's someone complaining about
the screaming baby on the plane.
So, earplugs are a must.
Lastly, I gotta have a sleep mask.
When I put this on I feel
like I'm in my own dark room
and less affected by distractions.
Alright guys that is what
I pack in my carry on
I will do a separate video on what
I pack in my actual suitcase.
I wanted to separate the two because
it would just be too much information
if I put them all together.
I would also love to know what you guys
pack in your carry-on.
If there's something that I missed
or if there's something that you just
absolutely have to have in order to fly.
Leave it in the comments down below.
I love reading them and responding.
I want to thank you guys
so much for watching
and I'll see you guys in the next one.
Bye. Muah.
