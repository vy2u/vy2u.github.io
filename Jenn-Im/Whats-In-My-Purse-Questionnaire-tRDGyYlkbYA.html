today we're going to start off by
showing you guys what's into both of our
purses also we're going to answer some
of your questions that you asked the
first that I carry around regularly and
I got this purse from Urban Outfitters
and got three years ago there's like a
kiss slump clutch in the middle so you
can put your really important things in
there I always carry around sunblock and
this is SPF 100 by Neutrogena don't
really like getting town so because my
skin is like super sensitive so I always
have to slaughter this all over my body
when it dries it's really matte so it's
cool to put all over your face - and I
always put this before I put any makeup
on a cannon just like a point-and-shoot
I have a DSLR but I just use this to
take like quick snapshots not only want
to look like a three-pound thing in my
purse wallet and it's hot pink when I
used to have a white one but I lost it
along with my license and everything
there's like a picture of like a cat on
it with like yellow blood I did this in
high school
super yellow inside I got at 4:21 it's
just kinda like your standard wallet and
a pack of gum and today I'm four bit and
it's wintermint my phone with me and
it's a palm pixi and right now it's dead
because I left my charger in seven
sisqó got a really cool keypad and
makes like cute little sounds for like
that a pressie sound just like that
sound is it that was carry this white
like contact case carrier and I got it
from this Japanese store called Meucci
where they don't believe in labels so
nothing has a label on it on my compact
and it's by Mac and it's pre old it's NC
25 on I'm a lipstick that means Sarah
bought together it's a Vegas bull just
cool like coral color and it's good for
everyday years and it's more neon in
real life
my main purse is this big structured
purse right here that I got from
Goodwill and I like things that are
sturdy and tailored brand is Charla's
Charles move and I'm not even that is my
sunglasses in the public Sandy's from
our Santee our video and other various
outfits you never know when you get
blinded while you're driving
plus it protect you from UV rays Swiss
Army knife always be prepared you know
when you've got sucked in to celebrate
this lipstick in my purse at all times
it's this color called Rose pick the tab
it's a really creamy formula so when I
have this I don't need chapstick either
it's kind of a staple with me it's just
something I could
put up a couple of rings that I throw
into my bag that kind of goes everything
with gold one is silver ones so with a
bronze like kind of grand you're just a
little bit funky I black moleskin
planner that I got Barnes and Nobles I
love it a lot because it's just a really
basic solid color pack of post-its
really write directions on these because
I don't have a GPS system
so I write directions and then I just
slap it onto my onto my wheels my iPod
walk around anywhere the market even in
my I don't know I feel weird I don't
have it on really like listen my music
not the music that means I'm stealing
Carl's jr. coupon packet
I always carry this there are two balls
for free fries in here of course my
phone I don't have my phone I just feel
really sad like I don't have a clock and
I don't have any communication with
anyone that I've done here already
camera I only is it take pictures of
things that I baked and I use the keypad
to text Jen
we are not related by blood or anything
we just spent too much time did you have
black hair no but it's just a vocal
synchrony thing where we talk to like
and do the same gestures it's almost
disgusting how much time he's been
together they're doing it Oh Mary do go
to college and I'm majoring in
communication and for my major I just
recently decided I want to eventually
become a veterinarian so I think you
majoring in zoology or some kind of
biological major just to clarify
everything we don't have like a blog we
don't have a topia or lookbook my
aunts and you may know fashion accounts
yeah this eight years and still cookin
yes going strong it was my I think
around like fifty five percent of my
world you're just drifted everything I
just kind of like mix and match that
vintage and modern pieces together
leave 70% of my channel is has been one
of my own piña or maybe your closet
smells like a pro store high school I
actually dress really plain I work just
t-shirts and jeans because I was in a
really exclusive monogamous relationship
where we were practically married and
neither was care how the other person
who looked or anything I only started to
like really expressed like my tastes and
stuff after we broke up
just I just did a 180 like I just came
election wrote it in my personality just
kind of was amplified because I was my
own first I guess and it wasn't really
like in spite of him or just to show in
my look or anything it was just kind of
an happy
being on your own on the high school I
really just like super girl you like I
would put on like fake eyelashes every
single day for no reason
and I was like Matt jaboney would make
sure I wouldn't wear like a lot of the
same times because I was like scared
that like
the same thing a lot of people have been
asking us like where we got our cross
earrings I actually made them and
they're really easy to make but I saw
four pairs left so if you want to get
wild then just message us and we'll give
you more info on like shipping and
handling and a lot of stuff of course a
lot of them music that we use for our
videos those stars we really like but
there's other things that we dabble to
like I really love Jenny Lewis and Laura
