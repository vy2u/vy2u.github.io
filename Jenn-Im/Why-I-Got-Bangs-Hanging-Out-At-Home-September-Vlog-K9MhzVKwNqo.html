- Hello, everybody.
- Hello.
- It is September 1st, Labor Day weekend.
We're at her house and
she has a really fun
drawer with snacks.
- It's actually a bunch of
stuff that I got from Japan
that I just never opened, so.
It's a little old, but
it is sealed, right?
- Okay, let's see the expiration date.
March 2017!
- Oh!
- Okay, that's fine.
- Okay, that works, yeah.
- Whatever, whatever.
- That works.
In a cool, dry environment.
If there's anybody in Japan that
knows these chips.
- Knows, what is that?
- Wow.
- Oh, I smell already.
- You smell it?
This smells like wood chips.
(laughs)
Doesn't it?
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
What are these?
- It's like--
- Really bizarre.
- It's like little, those
little ramen snacks but
in circle formation.
- The heat is slowly starting to build up.
- Oh, it's building.
- It is building.
- I can feel it.
- I like it, you have to get to know it.
(laughs)
- What do you grade it?
- Okay, out of five?
One, two, three, go!
(upbeat music)
Hi, everybody, happy Saturday.
Ben and I just finished the
B-roll for my August favorites.
We got this new monopod, check this out.
- Very happy with what I got.
- Yeah.
Ben's been doing a lot of research on
the best camera equipment and this is
like a total game-changer.
- It's good.
You can really get in there,
you can move it around and it's sturdy.
Recommend it.
- Ben has gotten our picnic
basket because today we are
going to Echo Park Lake.
And take Cheeki out and about,
which should be nice.
- She's gonna love it.
We were gonna go to the
beach but because it so hot
and we might drive like an hour-and-a-half
to get to a beach and then
Chippo might get too hot
within, like, 20 minutes, so.
- Yeah, and also
it's Labor Day Weekend,
- That's very true.
- And it's probably the
busiest weekend of the year.
- Yeah.
- We're just gonna
go somewhere close
- Park.
- Yeah, going to the park.
- [Ben] Just 100 fahrenheit
for the old park today.
- [Jenn] All right, we
have the park shop here.
- Done it, there's a lovely breeze.
We found some shade, Chippo's happy.
- [Jenn] Yeah, she is.
- We've got some nice
sandwiches from Bottega Louie.
It was only like a half-an-hour,
out of the route.
- Detour.
- Detour, so they better be good.
Obviously.
And there's some sour cream and onion.
- [Jenn] Yum.
(upbeat jazzy music)
Go pee-pee.
Wow, that's a long pee.
Good girl.
(upbeat jazzy music)
So this is pretty much my daily breakfast.
It is a low-carb tortilla
with one scrambled egg,
a bunch of arugula, and,
of course, sriracha.
- [Man] We're just starting
with the eyes open.
Nice, soft focus.
And then when you're ready,
beginning in the usual way,
some nice, big, deep breaths.
In through the nose and
out through the mouth.
- So I just finished my meditation,
I do this every morning for 20 minutes
and right now I'm on patience.
I finished two packs already.
I finish self-esteem and
then that was for 30 days
and then I did a stress package
and that was another 30 days,
and now I am on patience.
There are so many other
packs that I want to finish.
I think the next one I'm
going to do is change,
appreciation, and then
creativity, happiness,
anxiety, anger, there's
a whole medley of packs.
And I'm on my 35th day.
This should be longer but
when I was in Toronto,
I skipped a day and
then I ruined my streak.
I have meditated for a total of 23 hours,
77 sessions,
and then my average time
is around 18 minutes.
Overall I do feel a huge improvement
and it's just something
that I've been really liking
to incorporate in my daily routine.
Today is Labor Day.
I think I'm just gonna
take it super easy today,
just gonna go to the gym
and then edit my video
and then have dinner
with my friend Charlotte.
Yesterday, I didn't get to vlog because
my parents came over and they
basically helped me clean
the entire house, it was so sweet.
But before they came
and cleaned the house,
Ben and I cleaned the house before.
So we cleaned the house in order for them
to clean our house.
And now my house is so
clean, it feels so amazing.
I feel so lucky that my parents live
just, like, I don't know 30 minutes away.
It's such a blessing.
September is my favorite month
because it is my birthday month.
Okay, let's get going.
(upbeat hip hop music)
Get a man who can cook for you.
Not just every once in a while,
but every single day.
- Every day.
Got some chicken drumsticks,
some mash, and some sweet corn and peas.
- Chippo doesn't that smell good?
Today's workout was really good.
I did some waist exercises from
Cassey's little Instagram video.
So, we'll see if we're sore tomorrow.
That's, like, the,
that's how I evaluate
how hard I worked out,
if I'm sore the next day, you know?
- It's the only pain you want to feel.
- Yeah, right?
- I'm not in pain today, that's a shame.
- I know, like, goddamn.
This is one of my favorite meals.
- Jenn is a specialty on the mash.
- Oh, that's tasty.
You got to put this mustard in.
- Either English or Dijon.
I like Dijon in with mash,
it just gives it a slightly
creamier mustard feel.
And then just save the
English mustard for the side.
- Exactly.
- Think we'll have an early
lunch before the lunch.
- Pre-lunch, yeah?
Do I need anything more?
I've done it again.
- You've done it again.
She's smashed it.
- I mashed it.
- She smashed the mash.
- I smashed the mash.
All right, lunch is served.
I've got some of my favorite
condiments of all time.
Tapatio and Colman's mustard.
Oh my God.
It's so good.
Thank you!
(upbeat jazzy music)
You guys, here I am at
the Chaz Dean Salon,
with the lovely Anna, of course.
So, we're thinking if I
should get bangs or not
and it's just escalating so quickly.
I just did a poll on Twitter,
so we'll see what they say.
Okay, 61%.
- See, you're winning!
- All right.
- Chaz is doing it.
- We did a poll, already, 61%.
- [Chaz] They're saying
that you should do it?
- Yeah, 61%.
They said do it.
Oh my God.
I'm terrified.
This is really happening you guys.
- [Chaz] Ready?
- Oh my God, I'm scared.
(upbeat jazzy music)
This is CeCe.
I have bangs, you guys, I have bangs now.
Hey, guys, so I am back home with Chepo.
Hi.
And I also have bangs.
I haven't had bangs since I was 21.
So, wow.
That's like five years, that's nuts.
So, yeah, they're back in full force
and I really like the way they look.
It's the change that I've been wanting
because at first I
thought I was gonna cut it
into a bob or something
or, like, an A-line.
Do you want to leave?
She's leaving.
I thought I was gonna get,
like, an A-line cut but
I don't know, I think bangs
are less of a commitment
because they just grow
out so fast, so, yeah.
I went for it and I'm super
happy with the way they look.
I posted a photo on
Instagram, and, of course,
because it's such a change,
it's become a topic of discussion.
But thank you to everyone
who was nice to me about it.
Because at the end of the day, I'm the one
who has to see them every single day.
But, yeah, now I'm home and I'm just gonna
get a couple of treatments done
and then I'm gonna go celebrate
my brother's birthday.
I'm so happy for him, he's 30 now.
And we're gonna probably just celebrate
by eating Korean food.
That's, like, our
favorite way to celebrate
any sort of event.
I also wanted to thank everybody
for 2 million subscribers!
I can't believe it.
It's definitely been slow and steady
but I'm so happy and grateful
to have even reached this milestone.
It's been insane, thank you guys so much.
Ben's best friend from England is here.
His name is Sam and he is gonna be
spending the week with Ben and me.
Ben is so happy.
Right now he's at the Marina del Ray
and they're doing, like, water sports and
it makes me so happy that there's
a person from home here
because he hasn't been
back to England for,
like, almost two years.
Okay, the battery is about to die,
so I'll talk to you guys in a little bit!
So I'm wrapping my brother's gift.
I got him these Bose headphones.
These are supposed to be
the best in the market
and I thought that he would enjoy them.
He is also a musician, so
if you guys have SoundCloud,
please follow him at oh my muu.
He's so talented and
I think that these
headphones would be a good
way for him to make more music, y'all.
(upbeat jazzy music)
Ta-da!
In addition to headphones,
I'm also getting him
a roundtrip ticket to
anywhere around the world.
I'm just, like, putting it
on this little flash card.
Because I thought that this
would be a really great way
for us to spend time together.
He also only turns 30 once, so,
I wanted to get him something
really, really special.
I'm gonna put it in this
card, which I got at Ralph's.
It says, &amp;quot;Life is an
adventure, enjoy the ride.&amp;quot;
I thought it was very fitting,
so I'm gonna pop this in here
and then we're all done!
We're gonna head into some severe traffic.
(upbeat music)
Happy Birthday, James!
- Oh, wait.
- What is that?
- Oh, nice!
- [Jenn] It's from Ben and me!
- Oh, what?
- Round-trip ticket?
- Dude, are you serious?
- [Jenn] Uh-huh!
- Thank you, seriously.
- Of course.
Happy birthday.
- Let's go together, then.
- [Jenn] Yeah, let's go!
Do you like the headphones?
- Woah.
(laughs)
- [All] Happy Birthday, dear James-y.
- He's just so close.
- [All] Happy Birthday to you!
(clapping)
(upbeat jazzy music)
- [Jenn] Having dinner
with my lovely friend.
- Cheers.
- [Jenn] Cheers.
- [Stephanie] We also have
some zucchini noodles.
- Hey, everybody, it
is Saturday afternoon.
I'm just in the office
finishing up the video
that I'm uploading tomorrow.
It is gonna be the second
part of the August vlog.
It's the footage where you
get to see my Eggie brunch
and just, like, other
day-to-day activities.
If you haven't seen it, I will
put it in the card section.
Yeah, just trying to get as
much work done as possible
because tonight Ben and I are
having our housewarming party.
I know we've lived here
for several months now, but
this is just a good time for us
and a lot of people are around,
so we thought we would have it today.
Ben and Sam are currently
at the grocery store
grabbing the snacks and just, like,
other miscellaneous items
you need at a party.
I just made sure that the house was clean.
I vacuumed, I cleaned
the bathrooms, so, yeah.
I'm excited to have everybody over.
The food is prepared, or,
I guess, just the snacks.
I like to make sure that
the guests are nicely fed.
Chocolates, M&amp;amp;Ms, sour patch
kids, birthday cake Oreos,
the cheese and cracker
platter, got a veggie platter
for those who are healthy,
got some chips and dip,
my favorite, Hot Cheeto
Puffs, and the fries, yum.
We got some cups where you peel that off
and you can write your own name, so,
it saves from not knowing
whose cup is whose
and hopefully it'll reduce
the amount of plastic.
We've got two handles
of Tito's and Jameson,
the other handle is inside the freezer.
And I've cut up some limes over here.
Should I put a little
bit of Sprite in as well?
- I think that's a lovely idea.
Little bit of freshness.
- [Sam] Yeah.
- We're creating our own house cocktail.
- Yeah, it's basically, our
favorite drink is vodka,
soda, lime, just not too
sweet, nice and fresh, clear.
But we love cucumber as well,
it's a lovely little added touch.
And we're gonna do some blueberries
just to mix it up a little bit.
- This is Sam, the guy
I was talking about.
This is Ben's best friend from childhood.
- Hello, everyone.
(laughs)
- We're very happy to have this guy here.
- Yeah.
- He's the best.
- He's been amazing to have.
- You've been great hosts.
- It's easy, you know.
What have we done this trip,
we went to Santa Monica,
to Venice, paddleboat, that's
why I got a little cut there.
- Turns out paddling's quite hard.
- Paddleboarding is quite hard
- When you do it in the ocean.
- Especially when it's really wavy.
(doorbell rings)
(dog barking)
- Our first guest!
(upbeat jazzy music)
