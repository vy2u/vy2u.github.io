it's crazy right now the Canadian Geese
can you hear them it's like squawking
neighbors are talking and I don't know I
thought I found this before the Sun died
it's time for my winter fashion
favorites for the year 2012 and 2013
it's something that I always do every
year and this time I picked out six of
my favorite winter fashion trends and I
sell them for you guys and if you stay
tuned at the end there's going to be a
giveaway I think a cardigan is crucial
to have during fall and winter because
they're a dream to layer with and before
I moved out last year I stole this deep
purple cardigan for my mom's closet and
I'm obsessed with that chunky oatmeal
texture of it and underneath I'm wearing
this black semi sheer dress with a bunch
of delicate cross beading on the chest
part and I'm definitely channeling some
witchy vibes in here with this concho
hat from UNIF and I've heard a lot of
good things about L'Oreal's faris nude
and I have been converted I think it's a
beautiful nude shade and for accessories
I just piled on some silvertone jewelry
once her ebay one's a gift and ones from
flea market and no way was the best to
do a bear leg so I wore some opaque
tights and for my shoes I'm wearing my
Jeffrey Campbell tardy lows and if it's
a lock holder where you live he couldn't
always just throw on over a long coat
oxblood or burgundy is such a beautiful
rich color and excited to translate this
trend onto my lips using media by Mac
and if you see me wearing a dark lip
it's usually this color and I got my
beanie from the men's department from
Target and I love how it matches the
color of my lips I think they're the
exact shade it's crazy and for outerwear
I'm wearing one of my favorite shawls
and it's not the thickest of materials
but it's perfect for the winters where I
live and underneath I am wearing this
cream patterned sweater and I love how
it's asymmetrical so that means it's
longer in the back than the front and
underneath I am wearing a thermal to you
know collect more warmth to my body and
for bottoms I decided on this light
acid-wash a line skirt from shop tart
and I love how there's buttons in the
front and this thing's got pockets and
I'm wearing sheer tights from the
drugstore and I layered over my sheer
thigh highs and they look like they're
opaque because I'll aired them together
and for shoes I'm wearing these
platforms and I stuffed cotton balls on
the coast they wouldn't slip off because
I know if you a few of you guys were
having this problem to scarf like this
should already be in your closet I feel
like it's more of a winter essential
wrap and trend but whatever it's gonna
go in this video and mine's relatively
thin but it works out for me but if you
live in an area where it's a lot colder
I suggest getting something that's wool
or something that's very substantial and
thicker so you can hold more warmth to
you and I'm wearing this printed
cardigan and I love the color
combination on this because it's quite
masculine yep this thing's got pockets
so it just earned five points in my book
and I layered under another cardigan
because I needed more warmth because I'm
practically wearing nothing underneath
it I know I might seem weather impaired
but I'm actually wearing this crop top
because it really showcases my disco
pants and I love these suckers and
they've been in they've been a staple in
my closet for a full year and to
elongate my legs I decided to pair it
with my go-to black platform boot and on
my lips I just
stuck with l'oréal's Ferriss nude I
honestly have no idea who coined that
phrase you can't wear white after Labor
Day because I think that's a lot of BS
you can wear whatever color you want in
whatever season it's all up to you and
I'm choosing to wear ivory for the
winter time and I love this coat because
you can toughen it up by adding you know
subtle accessories and it's the little
details that are going to really pull
off your entire look and I'm wearing
this brilliant emerald cable-knit jumper
and I layered it over a white
button-down and if you're still cold you
can always wear a fitted thermal
underneath and for pants I decided to go
with these really 90s grungy grey floral
bottoms and I love how tight they are
and I went along and cuffed the ends of
the pants because I really wanted to
highlight these bad boys which are my
creepers and these shoes pretty much
saved my life for the rainy days and
they're they're holding up pretty well
and in case my head starts to freeze I'm
wearing my black beanie and I rolled it
up twice so it has more of a fitted look
to it and on my lips I'm wearing media
by Mac
sequins are so much fun to wear at night
especially in the wintertime and I think
the sequin blazer from daily look looks
awesome when it catches the light and
this sparkly number is great because
although it's got a structured shoulder
you don't look like a linebacker at all
instead it adds a really subtle
definition instead and I'm wearing my
suicidal tendencies shirt that I got at
a flea market as the base of my outfit
and I am wearing this metallic skirt and
I love how it's an elastic waist so you
can choose how high or low it goes and I
wanted to cover up my legs so I'm
wearing these opaque tights and for
shoes I'm wearing my cherry red Jeffrey
Campbell tardies and I love the skater
lace-up of the shoe and how easy they
are to walk in them and to finish off
the look I went with a matching red lip
okay
last outfit y'all broke or Barack as
some people call it husband a trend for
quite some time now and these baroque
pants are the ones that will be given
away so stay tuned at the end so you can
find out how we can win a pair of these
SiC denim skinnies and I belted these
pants with addicted belt and for
outerwear and wearing my cropped moto
jacket and I didn't realize how much I
love lapels until I opened up my closet
and realized that a lot of my jackets
have lapels so I guess that's the face
for now and for a little bit of extra
warmth I'm wearing this Navy cardigan
and I'm wearing this cropped turtleneck
from American Apparel that you're
probably sick of and on my feet I
slipped on a warm toned boot to
coordinate with the gold print of the
pants and lastly I'm wearing these
sunglasses and I love them because they
have such a delicate frame to it
