updated back-to-school outfits for
wintertime because the one night I
failed in August just isn't gonna fly by
with this temperature because it's far
too cold I tried to dress some specific
ranges of temperature for you guys
because I know you guys live in
different climates and environments so I
try to suit your needs but the lowest
temperature I go down is around 40
degrees Fahrenheit well I'm sorry if it
gets any colder where you live anything
clothing that I haven't said in I dress
for it because the coldest it gets here
is around 35 I guess and that's at
nighttime like dead of night this outfit
goes to all my southern girls who have a
warmer winter and I'm really jealous cuz
I didn't realize how warm I had it in
SoCal until I moved anyway this tan
cardigan is perfect cuz it's a great
easy and neutral layering piece
underneath I'm wearing this textured
sweater that I layered under just a
sheer chiffon bun down to add a little
bit more interest to my look I'm wearing
a pleather skirt because it's still warm
enough to wear skirts and I'm wearing a
little hat because you guys know how
much I love head accessories and I'm
just wearing a neutral it let's discuss
shoes I love fat chunky shoe
aesthetically and comfort wise the thick
heel makes it really easy to walk in and
I think every girl needs a pair of
ass-kicking shoes let's get a few
degrees chillier I'm wearing this
graphic tee because it's a little it's
still a little bit warm and I layered
the crop out of this outfit such as this
Navy button-down and when it's cold
every layer counts and this last layer
is this amazing kind of as a dupe for
the zara jacket and i love the
functionality of this scott pockets and
I'm such a sucker for lapels it's kind
of unhealthy
and for a skirts I'm wearing this very
interesting layered paneled skirt I
personally never seen a skirt like this
so I'm really excited to play around
with it for accessories I'm just wearing
this really edgy chunky chain jewellery
from see jewelry online.com on my lips I
went for a vampy lip because I was
aiming for kind of a brooding vibe and
moving on to shoes yes sometimes I do
work platforms to school because I love
the height and it's comfy so why not
look fab at school right when you're
layering it's essential to have a warm
foundation so stock up on your thermals
because they make a vast difference for
outerwear I'm wearing a denim shearling
jacket and it's something one of the
dudes from the film The Outsiders would
wear and I just feel really tough in it
and underneath I am just wearing a plain
old standard hoodie it's my favorite
it's cropped plus you can throw up the
hood it's add a little bit more warmth
to your ears in your head and since the
rest of my outfit it was kind of kind of
boring I threw on these really funky
interesting as striped pants and I'm
just wearing the same old stomping boots
so this temperature is officially cold
for me so it's time to bust out that
faux fur I think there's a way to tone
down the automatic lavishness of a faux
fur coat by making your outfit
monochromatic and in this case I'm
wearing my black slimming disco pants
underneath I'm wearing a striped shirt
because the coats gonna cover it anyway
and when you take it off you don't want
to look completely black and I'm wearing
the opaque tights underneath my pants to
add some extra warmth wearing a circle
scarf for an accessory as well as these
I of raw or forest earrings
in order to elongate my body I'm wearing
my black creepers to kind of just
streamline from the darkness of the pant
to my toes to just give the illusion of
long legs this is probably the warmest
outfit you've seen on me and I admit it
I look a little bit puffed up but hey I
gotta stay functional right and it's
oversized but that makes it really easy
to layer thick sweaters underneath and
I'm wearing this graphic sweater and
it's kind of a terry cloth material but
a lot softer and I layered a button-down
Ernie for pants I'm wearing these
acid-washed skinnies because I just felt
like it and I'm wearing my Dean juries
and their skyscraper tall plot they're
light fun and easy to walk in let me
