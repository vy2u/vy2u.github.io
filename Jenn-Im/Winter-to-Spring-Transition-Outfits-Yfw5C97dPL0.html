be about winter trends transitioning
into the spring you'll be really
surprised to see how versatile your
closet items can be not all clothing
pieces are confined to one season and
you'll be shocked to see that a lot of
trends for any season can work year
round the cowl-neck is like the
turtlenecks more relaxed and chill
sister because the neckline is more
fluffy and has less structure this top
from American Apparel has been one of my
winter essentials because it's extremely
soft and cozy
I loved pairing this really loose knit
with something more aggressive like
these really thick pleather pants and
during the winter it's essential to keep
your feet warm so close toe heels aren't
absolutely must and a beanie will keep
your noggin warm so that's how I'd style
that top in the winter so let's switch
on over to the springtime and as you can
see I'm still wearing that same old
speckled knit top but I made it look
more springtime friendly with the
accessories I added this pattern head
wrap that I got from Goodwill there's
tons of scarves like this after of
stores best of all they're really really
really cheap and I think I got mine for
less than a dollar for shorts I slipped
into something white and frilly the
tiered lace kind of makes it look like a
doily but I really dig it I decided to
add some pops of color on my arms so I
put on these braids it's from Nasty Gal
and a flea market and on my feet I'm
wearing the Jeffrey Campbell soiree I
love this shoe because it's borderline
modern Cinderella and night Walker I
guess it's all about perspective but
whatever you want to label them I'm
obsessed with how they look
a cream cable-knit sweater was one of my
foundations for the winter because it
acted like such a great base when I
wanted to create really loud and
flamboyant outfits like this one I'm
obsessed with wearing and this fur
collar that I got on a block sale the
blogger was named pretty another it just
breathed new life into this otherwise
very plain fringe Brown cardigan it just
adds extra warmth and gives it a regal
vibe my disco pants were a winter staple
of mine and this cute newsboy cap was
perfect throw on my head when I had
really bad hair days in the winter time
for my spring outfit I just stripped out
all my layers and just gravitated
towards the simplicity of this sweater I
threw on my floral head crown because
it's hard not to feel like a princess in
it I made this crown last summer and I'm
really stoked that it's finally warming
up so I can bust this baby out again I
added sunny sole on my lips to add a
flush of fresh pink on my lips and for
my skirt I went for this very dark
floral one that I think they're pure
while back it's got buttons on the front
and an elastic waistband for extra
comfort moving down to my feet my
Gertie's are back in action and they're
just doing their thing
monochrome is always on trend but in the
winter it's natural to one where all
black and it might be due to the gnarly
weather outside but regardless I found
myself wearing a lot of black this
winter to this blacks buckled cardigan
has been one of my go-to cardigans for
winter quarter and it's probably because
it's really big
speckled and it has pockets I decided to
mix things up by adding this pleather
top I thrifted when I bought it
it still had the tab on it it's crazy
and on my head I went for this beanie
from the men's department and this
outfit pretty much sums up my winter
uniform just because the spring doesn't
mean that you have to wear all floral if
wearing blocks you're saying go for it
and I decided to wear this mesh black
top has a black bar that covers the
boobs and over that I threw on this
black moto jacket that goes with
everything for my shorts I wore these
crackle design shorts from motel and
because they're a little bit big on me I
belted the entire thing with this silver
belt that I got the Alameda flea market
this month I accessorized to look by
adding these really fun metal round
shades from Lulu's and you can actually
see my camera room and so in the
reflection on my lips I'm wearing Vegas
volt which is a nice coal color and on
my feet I went crazy and wore my she
craved flat forms from Eagle and greed I
absolutely love the studying on the toes
and studying on the back too
oh the trench coat it's just an absolute
wardrobe essential for any woman this
trench coat is from Lulu's and it's very
very thick wool material it's more of a
heavy duty coat which made it ideal for
the wintertime so for my winter outfit
example I wore this oversized star
printed sweater that has just a bunch of
slashes and distress on it and I tucked
half of the sweater into this flutter
skirt from daily look and then I
finished off the rest NOLA with these
close toe platforms
this trenchcoat can still be worn the
spring time as long as you compromise
the rest of your outfit into something a
little bit more breezy I love this
trench because you can close it up for
something that looks a little bit more
refined for my top I'm wearing this
thrifted cat one it used to be this
monster sweater but I cut it into this
small dainty tank and for my shorts I
wanted light denim for more of an airy
Springfield and then I slipped into my
cutout boots from Etsy unfortunately
they're sold out because it's dead stock
but I'm sure if people called eBay
something is bound to come up for makeup
I went for a very very simple eye and
slept on sunny sole on my lips please
