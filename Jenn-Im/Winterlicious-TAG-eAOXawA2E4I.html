I filmed probably because it's been
finals week and yesterday I finished so
technically it's freedom and I thought I
would get the ball rolling on filming by
doing the Winterlicious tag I was tagged
by bunny who was graveyard girl here on
YouTube and if you don't know her by now
go check her out because she is a
personality all neuro and she is not
from this planet and she's gorgeous and
she's funny and you're gonna love her
anyway let's get the question started
one is just a classic nude it's what and
while it's private viewing and initially
I didn't like it on my nails I felt like
very Menken like and just really boring
my after a few hours I just got
accustomed to the color and I really
liked it it stayed on my nails for a
good solid week an applicator for this
is nice and rounded and it surprisingly
soaks up a crap-ton of product so
painting your nails is just a dream and
very therapeutic when everything is
going smoothly my second color is Urban
Outfitters ashtray and I like to use a
black base first or any dark shade
because I find that it really brings out
the color of ashtray and the end result
is this really cool mixture between a
blue and a green and it's gunmetal I
think it's just a really unusual shade
that goes with every color I want to say
a vampy shade but I'm going to refrain
from that because I mentioned a lot of
them or all of my vampy shades in my
fault AG so I'm gonna go for nudes NARS
honey honey is one of my Holy Grail nude
lipsticks it is this peachy nude no
hints of pink at all and I think it just
really complements all of skin tones and
I think it's the perfect wingman when
you're going for a very smoky eye
because it just really shifts all
attention to your eyes
if Honolulu honey is out of your price
range another nude lipstick that I
really love is L'Oreal's fairest nude I
heard a lot about it on YouTube a lot of
budget crews are raving about it so I
thought I would check it out and I am
fan it's great I think it was around $9
so I mean if you're willing to splurge
on this I think it's a really universal
and classic shade to have I'm gonna go
with my gray hoodie I was planning on
mentioning it in my December favorites
but
whatever F its gonna go share now it's
been my staple learning piece i layer it
with everything because it's super soft
provides so much warmth and it just
really complements every type of
outerwear that I put I'll wear it with a
jean jacket I'll write with a camo
jacket and I'll wear it with my leather
jacket it really doesn't matter it
really depends on my mood I just learned
to mention that I washed it was downy
UNSTOPABLES
so it is fresh out of the wash and it's
the smell is seeping out of my closet
and entering my roommate it smells like
an amazing laundromat here beanies I
think that was a given if you don't know
I'm a radical beanie enthusiast and I'll
wear it year-round but it actually makes
sense and in the winter time I think
they're perfect for bad hair days
especially when your bangs are all
jacked up it just keeps them in the
position that you'd want them to and
plus when the wind blows your babies
just stay just nice and flat my favorite
scent is 5/2 this candle from PacSun and
it is called one nut to lick please let
me know how to pronounce this because I
know I'm saying it wrong so if you can
please comment and tell me how to
pronounce it
I believe it's Merry Christmas and
Italian and the smell is surprisingly
not your you know quintessential
Christmas smell and I find the smells
very complex
it's got like gentle bursts of cinnamon
and little hints of citrus it's just a
very bizarre scent but I like it because
it's not very girly a guy or a girl
could be burning this in the room and no
one would think twice so I'm really
boring my winter beverage never really
changes it's either a black coffee or an
Americano but one of my housemates works
at Starbucks and she gets to bring home
like a pound of coffee every week and
recently she brought in this Christmas
plaid blonde roast and I loved it that's
been my staple for summer now and she
brought this espresso blend as well and
I freaking love it I don't put any sugar
or creamer in my coffee I like it black
my favorite Christmas movie is gonna be
home alone too
my brother and I used to watch it all
the freakin time my all-time favorite
scene is towards the beginning when
Kevin isn't that choir with his brother
and I know Kevin floods up the entire
thing and it's just chaos and in the end
this giant Christmas cardboard decal
falls on the piano woman and it's just
not funny when I'm explaining it but
every time I see that scene I just like
crack up aesthetically and it's strange
because it's not typically my humor but
I think it's so funny still it's crazy
baby it's cold outside I know it's kind
of a creepy duet but I love it if you've
seen elf zooey deschanel sings that was
Will Ferrell and they really complement
each other very well and that's when I
discovered my love for that song and
then Zooey Deschanel's voice is kind of
like honey dripping from a stick so
she's phenomenal to listen to but yes
baby it's cold outside I guess just the
feasting aspect of it I don't really
have a certain typical favorite food
that I go to because usually when
usually during Christmas my family just
makes a cluster pile of food and it's
just raining food we'll have Korean ribs
well have mashed potatoes and love
kimchi and we'll have like ham it's just
we just eat anything and I just think I
like the whole kaleidoscope of foods in
that sense so that meal is my favorite
holiday food I guess the closest
decoration in my room is this Emerald
sequin dress by Motel rocks and it's
just been hanging on my wall for
inspiration and I guess it kind of comes
close to a Christmas tree in the sense
that it's sparkling and it's green and
it makes me happy I'm get a laptop I'm
in dire need of an upgrade it doesn't
even have a battery to it so it
constantly needs to be plugged in and if
that cord just jingles the slightest bit
it just it just turns off and so I lose
all my work and it's just very
frustrating makes editing and importing
and exporting videos so much longer than
it actually is and yeah so anyway I've
been saving up and it's been really good
so I'm going to probably spoil myself
beginning the year and get myself a new
laptop I'm driving down to SoCal on the
20th I believe and I'm gonna be reunited
with my friends and family and it's
gonna be amazing it's been so long since
I've seen them so I'm so excited to go
back and I'm actually going to vlog
pretty much every day on my break back I
know you guys really enjoyed my spring
break vacation vlog and so I think I do
a winter break vacation so be prepared
for that that's all the questions
cool be prepared for a lot more videos
because I'm a free woman now and I get
to do whatever I want
so if you have an Instagram my username
is I'm genom feel free to follow me I
would really enjoy that and I'll talk to
you guys my next video goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
