time this video goes up it will already
be my birthday I'm 30 years old today I
am very excited I made one of these
videos last year where I talked about 29
life lessons I've learned in 29 years
you guys seem to like that video and I
don't do that kind of thing often so it
feels like something nice to do today
for my birthday because I'm excited I
realize that that video contains a lot
more like weird advice than actual
advice but put a little more advice in
here but I mean it's still me so it's
still weird but here we go
here's 30 life lessons that I've learned
in 30 years Ruba vacuum cleaners are not
for people that have dogs that go to the
bathroom on wee-wee pads my dad sent me
a Roomba a few years ago and I got
really excited I took it out the box and
let it vacuum around on the ground like
a little circle robot that just goes
around and it went right over a big pile
of poop and the little brush on there
continue to spray poop all over the rest
of my house took me like a solid hour of
cleaning the whole thing to get all the
poop out of it I wish someone told me
that before so I'm telling you good
lesson to learn I wish I didn't learn it
if you're currently in school might I
suggest keeping a group journal not like
a burn book or anything crazy like that
but like I would write an entry and then
I would pass it to my friend she would
write an entry and then we pass around
our circle of friends and it was
hilarious and in the back we would keep
like a tally of which boys we liked so
we made sure we didn't like the same guy
you know it was really awesome I would
give anything to read that group diary
again I know you guys have group chats
and whatever you guys do now but like a
physical journal that you can look back
on someday is something I would highly
suggest because I wish I could find that
thing it was amazing unless someone else
finds it in which case you're fucked if
you have a bathtub that's also your
shower take five minutes and just buy a
bath mat I spent so many years showering
in a slippery bathtub and almost died
hundreds of times I finally got a bath
mat and I can't tell you how important
it is to just get a bath bath kay it's
not worth it
bathtub Awareness 2k16 I don't know why
I didn't get one before I just thought
slipping and almost dying was part of my
daily shower routine when I was younger
I was dating this guy that was like all
wrong for me and I
and find it in a friend about it and I
was like what do you think I should do
you know what she said to me just
because you know something isn't right
doesn't mean you can change the way that
you feel that's not how your heart works
and I think about that all the time
sometimes whatever seems logical isn't
the right decision because it's not how
your heart works I mean we broke up a
while after that but I'm glad that I
made that heart decision to stick around
for a little while if it's your 21st
birthday don't let your friends get you
one of those necklaces with the shot
glass on it and let them pour whatever
they want in it and make you drink it
it's terrible you just end up drinking
the worst mixture of all kinds of
alcohol and a little hole where the
beads go through like makes it so it
spills on you every single time you
drink it it's terrible
miserable awful don't do it never ever
ever ever go on an all carats diet I did
that for a couple days in college I was
crash dieting and decided I was only
gonna eat carrots it doesn't work it's
disgusting and it's awful also don't
ever make up a diet and then decide
that's your diet it doesn't work always
know that however bad you think you have
it right now someone's always got it way
worse than you good way to do this is
just turn on the news really quick but I
personally learned this one time in
college and parts of this story have
been changed for privacy reasons we've
all sit around the kitchen table we
would call it negative town and we would
just sit there and take turns bitching
about whatever was wrong with our lives
and our super quiet friend just sat
there one time and just listened to us
for hours bitching a negative town and
we were like all right your turn what do
you have to complain about and she said
to us well I went home and I hooked up
with a guy and now I have herpes and I
can't afford the medication so all I can
do is just lay in the bathtub and cry
because it hurts and we adjourned
negative town forever sorry it's not
meant to be funny but we adjourned
negative town forever we literally never
had a negative town after that ever
again negative town was adjourned
forever somebody always has it worse
than you just don't even bother
complaining never say something behind
someone's back that you aren't
completely willing to say directly to
their face it'll keep you out of a lot
of trouble and also when the person
comes to you and says hey did you say
this about me as long as it's something
I said I'll say hell yes I did it's
relatively easy for me though because I
do not shy away from
confrontation I'm a fan of it because
sometimes it's necessary yeah sure
people don't like it and sometimes it's
out of line it's uncalled for but you
know at least I said it to your face
which is a lot more than a lot of people
can say you should try it get new shoes
every once in a while I used to be
firmly on team no new shoes ever I wore
the same pair of sneakers from seventh
grade until my sophomore year of college
because I liked them even in the snow
just throw a sock on go traction fall
down all the time
didn't matter these are my shoes it got
to the point where a friend of one of my
friends stopped her and asked her is
Janet okay does she need money for shoes
because these are very concerning but
you know what happened I ended up
hurting my feet a lot and parts of my
calves and shins from just having really
inappropriate Footwear on all the time
so if you're anything like old me and
just don't want to let go of your shoes
just do it man okay you're gonna hurt
your life in your feet and then your
back and your neck and it's just it's
gonna be bad get new shoes okay
this is a little cliche but whatever it
is you don't like about yourself just
try the best you can to embrace it when
I was in middle school you know what I
didn't like about myself my butt because
it was the 90s and it wasn't really like
a cool thing to have a big butt for your
body no I'm saying that's a picture of
me and I thought my butt was so big and
I was so embarrassed I was like oh
terrible but guess what fast forward to
now girl you gonna be okay when I was in
middle school I knew so many girls that
hated their eyebrows because these
pencil-thin nineties eyebrows were all
the rage and guess who everyone wants
eyebrows like now Harry I brought people
so if you don't feel strongly enough to
change it about yourself do I encourage
you to do just maybe give our culture a
little bit of time to catch up to how
beautiful you are just the way you are
fam no I'm finna vent you got a good
butt
no the moment to be done with something
I'm a big believer in you don't commit
to something unless you can fully commit
like I was never allowed to quit
anything ever you get to see everything
through to the end so I'm still like
that as an adult but the moment I
learned this was when I was younger I
was on a competitive gymnastics team I
was getting ready to do the vault well I
was so tired that I ran full speed hit
the springboard and ran directly into
the vault and I just remember not being
able to breathe looking up at the
ceiling and being like mastics isn't the
sport for me I know I think I've done so
now in the rest of my life I always look
for those moments where I have run into
the horse and knocked the wind out of
myself because that is my done time
thing to learn if you're ever presented
with an opportunity to move to another
place take it whenever I move somewhere
I like to tell myself well I already
know that I like where I was and if
after a year or so I hate where I move
to I could just move back because I know
that place is always gonna be there but
I know too many people they regret never
moving somewhere new so just move pack
up your shit get in the truck and move I
know it's a little more complicated than
that but just think of it that way and
fix it a lot easier and way less
stressful and not as crazy sometimes you
just need to be in a place where you
just don't know anyone and just have to
go figure your life out that's when you
learn who you really are you have to
spend a lot of time with yourself don't
ever try to flush a pork chop down a
toilet doesn't work trust me doesn't
work a really great way to kill a spider
probably if your outside is to take a
lighter and then something aerosol and
make it like a blowtorch and then like
torch it today it's just something I
figured out don't be ashamed of your
humaneness one time glozell came over to
my house and we just sort of moved in
and there was still stuff everywhere it
was kind of a mess and I was like really
sorry for this mess and she was like no
don't apologize for the mess that makes
me feel comfortable those people's
houses are too clean I don't trust those
people and she's right I don't trust
those people either I used to be so
embarrassed if there was like messes in
my house felt like people were judging
me but I'm not ashamed of it anymore I'm
a human being humans live in this house
and sometimes there's messes deal with
it you know what's cooler than doing
what all of your friends are doing is
not doing what all of your friends are
doing one time when I was in middle
school I had multiple prints that
decided that they wanted to read the
dictionary in its entirety and I
seriously considered doing it until I
was like you know what fuck that and
then I was the only one not reading the
dictionary and I just sat there and
spaced out at lunchtime well they've
read the dictionary it was dope I mean
you can apply that to a lot of things
but that's the one that comes to mind
like fuck reading the dictionary dude
I'm gonna sit here at spaced out it's
gonna be a far better use of my time if
you're ever up really late and have to
be up really early in the morning sleep
sitting up what I do it's just sort of
uncomfortable enough so that you wake up
easier and it looks hilarious if anyone
sees you it works for me if you ever
feel like you're gonna pass out make
sure you tell someone that you feel like
you're gonna pass out I'm getting better
at it but a lot of times when I'm in
like hospitals or getting blood drawn
I've made the mistake in the past of
just quietly following a
/ don't just fall over makes people kind
of mad sometimes like I got yelled at by
a doctor like why didn't you tell me
you're passing out I don't know I was
blacking out but you can't I've done it
successfully I've told someone I'm
passing out right now I think it's just
the effort that they appreciate if you
ever start seeing tiny little moths in
your house like you saw in my house a
while ago just take your whole rug and
just throw it out the window
holy shit just take my word for it there
in your rug and they're not leaving
until you make them leave always give
credit where credit is due I learned
this in college where you literally get
expelled if you don't give credit not
everyone goes to college I understand
that one of my teachers framed it to us
like this nothing about giving credit
makes you look bad if anything it makes
you look good by citing your sources and
having valid places to get information
especially on the Internet where I feel
like internet culture just thrives on
credit
just give somebody credit just look at
Melania Trump if she had started that
speech with Michelle Obama once said
there'd be nothing wrong with that but
instead she chose not to give credit
where credit is due
it's not a good look always give credit
to people it also makes people feel
special so do that too don't ever try a
new sport if you're severely hungover
first time I tried water skiing I hit
the water and threw up and then I had to
float in a puddle of my own vomit until
the boat came back round picking you up
it's gross it's not worth it just say
you can't go or something always do the
right thing unless it doesn't feel right
I'm an altruistic law abiding citizen
and I found myself at a moral crossroads
one day when a disheveled looking man
walked past me in the grocery store in
the liquor aisle and I watched him shove
a bunch of beers inside of his jacket
and in his pants he turned to me made
full eye contact with me and I sort of
stood there and was a half laughing
thought should I tell someone but it
didn't feel right to tell someone you
know why because karma is real but it's
not always your job to make sure that it
gets served is he gonna get in trouble
eventually yeah there's like cameras and
people that work there sure it's not the
first time he's done it look you look
like a pro at it but the right thing to
do would be to tell someone hey I saw
that guy shove a bunch of beer down his
pants but in that moment on that day
when we locked eyes just didn't seem
right it's not my job to this you know
what you seem like you're having a hell
time and I think the best thing for me
to do is to just keep it moving I'm not
gonna snitch always do the right thing
les doesn't feel right I'm still very
happy with that choice and I hope that
he's doing well try your very best not
to get too stressed out about anything
I'm guilty of this at times and it has
very real consequences as I'm sure a lot
of you know but I'd like to share one of
those consequences with you and my
friends gonna kill me but my very best
friend who's getting married next week
was apparently so stressed out about the
planning of her wedding that she
developed a little twitch in her eye and
thought it was nothing so just carried
on and it turned into like a whole face
twitch
I'm selfishly hoping that she still has
it when I get to see her next week but
you know this is what happens when you
don't just distress one thing I like to
do is just slow down the time any way
possible I like to lay down outside and
just stare at the sky and think about
nothing so for aliens if you ever break
your toe and you like you know it's
broken and you don't really know what to
do just don't go to a doctor just like
let it heal by itself and then it'll
heal fine just like a little less bendy
than it was before that's what I did I'm
a doctor now speaking of doctors they're
just people with opinions you don't have
to listen to them I've been to lots of
different doctors in the past that just
tell you things that just don't quite
seem right just don't listen to them
sure they've been to school for like a
whole decade or whatever but you've
lived with your body for your entire
life just see another doctor or just do
whatever you think is right then just
leave them a bad review on Yelp it's fun
cleansing especially if they deserve it
don't ever try to narrow or like shave
your little sideburns here and then put
fake tan on it it looks crazy I went to
a wedding like that everyone was like
what's wrong with your face I was like
do I look like I want to fuck and talk
about it take lots of pictures of videos
all the time and save them forever
it's different now it's like phones and
everything but I always tell that to
people with puppies I'm like take a
thousand pictures because it feels like
you do but then when you look back
you're like oh yeah really wish I just
had more pictures look like this like
whenever I travel end up taking a lot of
pictures of like what's around me and
now I don't have pictures of like me and
who I'm with and like the memory making
part you know you know what's really
boring when you're going through your
photo album or when you travel and it's
just like all places that you can
totally Google better pictures of you
can't Google pictures of you and your
friends always know which goals and
dreams to pay attention to and which
other ones to just not pay attention to
for example Hurley
large strawberry milkshake into an
oncoming subway is something that I
dream about daily I'm not going to do it
I know a lot of people that don't know
the difference between dreams you should
do and dreams you shouldn't do hang out
with them sometimes not all the time but
just know that we all have them and know
which ones to do not do because some of
them are just you're gonna get arrested
and lastly don't ever trust your lights
because it'll just commit suicide and
kill themselves whenever they want now
it's time for ghost stories who's ready
for Halloween now I'm just getting
Leslie and sappy Asst I'd say I know a
lot of people they use the word regret
and live with regrets and I just
disagree with that a hundred percent
because I feel like whatever choice you
made in the past you made the best
choice that you could given the
circumstances in any possible moment
that you could make and if you just
shift the word regret into I made the
best possible choice I could at the time
you don't have to live with any regrets
and it also helps me understand other
people and why they do the things that
they do they're just making the best
possible choice for them I don't have to
think about why or what they're doing I
don't to think about it it's so
incredibly liberating to not have any
regrets and also sometimes just not be
mad at people because they're just doing
the best that they can just like you
know what I'm saying I apologize that
this ended this way but this is just the
only way to start off my 30th year it's
just how my life always is why would I
expect this year to be any different and
thank you for another year of even
giving a shit about me as a human being
and I appreciate you hope that you like
this video and subscribe to my channel I
make new videos every Wednesday /
Thursday and I'm gonna go enjoy my
birthday know right see you guys next
week bye I only regret in life is that
my face doesn't look like this
permanently all the time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
