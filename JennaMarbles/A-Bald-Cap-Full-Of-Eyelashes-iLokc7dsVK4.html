liberty of choking this princess in the
beauty store so nice girls do this I
promise I said that if you want me to
make a video just like tweet it at me
and I'll make it at this point so that's
what I'm doing
somebody's been requesting on every
platform Facebook Twitter YouTube like
they're on every my blog but usually to
fill out tell Jenna to get a bald cap
and cover it in fake eyelashes look
Laurel is gonna end we might as well do
what we can while we're here you know I
could put it on and glue them on but
like I won't be able to get the back at
all it's gonna be a bloodbath and I
really can't rope Julian into this he's
had it with me but I'm trying to figure
out a way to get them on here so that
when I stretch it onto my head they
don't all like pop off my theory is that
it's just going to look like short hair
and this is just going to be a hole I'm
essentially making a wig out of tiny
short hair we're just gonna have a nice
little craft time I'm going to cover
this bald cap in fake eyelashes what I
swear to God and I'm going to put it on
my head and I think it's gonna look like
hair but we don't know so let's find out
Charlie be perfect laughing it's her own
fucking goal there we are
okay sign the front and the tokens of
her joke in the bunch all my ears like a
little bit weird are the inner power you
know like the other parts are working
with that should I give her a part or
not should they be facing down like that
or or up like this oh oh yeah it's
looking so good already we only got one
pair on oh no that's a blutbad I'm just
gonna try to do the back because I don't
want them to be too close to each other
because I don't want to run out of
lashes this is much better because then
I can lay them on top of each other
instead of like trying to get them under
like I think that that looks pretty nice
and natural don't come in here to laugh
and judge there's a girl look like if
I'm imported baby we're given a haircut
to second possibility order like this is
already like two packs the lashes and
I've only covered that much oh this
looks so fucking gross to you watch I'm
done with this I'm like girl where'd you
get that wig and now I'm in bail he'll
let me get one oh you oh it looks so
good Oh yoo-hoo of all capful
rhinestones oh well
y'all gonna show it of my exquisite wig
so I made significant progress I think
it's looking nice why you look
disappointed because I am but why are
you disappointed you look tested
you haven't even know you don't fucking
tickets in in here
business in the front but hole in the
back like a bubble oh no it looks great
you need to finish so because right now
a little bit Carlos a little bit Darla
like Laura Garber not quite hot caramel
like imagine being our trash person is
hiding this trip that's our home but my
trash that's a good video and you know
the comments if you want to see what's
in my trash bin here our trash bin I
can't wait to wear a bald cap full of
eyelashes would make fun of you for
having a pigeon Center you're miserable
packaging if you can but see how nice to
meet everything in yeah I'm not really
I'm a particle things have to be
organized you're gonna have a lot of
hair clips for your nose I mean hair
clinical characteristics music like
apply the lashes they can also work as
hair clips comment below
that this is the hair clip because it is
not here it's a lot of the better
haha Julian trying to later what get hot
oh I love saying I'm seeing honey turn
his head so I think we should function
