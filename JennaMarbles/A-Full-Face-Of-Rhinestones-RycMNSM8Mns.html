feel like a long time ago my channel
just morphed into Jenna's selfish time
where I use whatever is going to make me
laugh
Neela I'm not even sorry I've been
having the greatest time my videos are
all really fun to make and I am just
been laughing so I hope that you like
them as well and if you don't that's
okay I don't know if you've ever felt
like this before but it happens to me on
occasion where I will see a picture and
immediately become envious I want that
to be me now and someone tweeted me this
picture and I was just overcome with the
feeling of I just want that to be my
life I want that to be my face I want it
on my face now there's been lots of
people that make videos like these like
really beautiful makeup tutorials with
actual like rhinestones I'm not going
for that I'm going to do it full face of
rhinestones not good writing so like
they're pretty chunky I realized that
the ones that are really fine and small
and this looking look really nice no
matter what the chunky ones sort of miss
form your face and look ridiculous
so that's what I want I want chunky no I
couldn't find a rhinestone tool so the
person is Joann Fabric gave me a little
hat but it's cool candle wax on there
I'm going to be able to pick these up
like this oh and I was going to get
spirit gum which is a very strong
adhesive but most makeup artists seem to
just use clear eyelash glue which sounds
like a better ordeal because I've used
spirit gum and that should know the most
I hope that these are similar to the one
for the girl in the picture because I
won't look just like her I'll live her
life I want to be her I want to be on
her that is a pound of big blink so most
people that do this they seem to like
work in sections of their face but I
mean I don't really feel like doing that
I kind of feel like making a little
beard first I got to be honest I didn't
really watch those tutorials so I don't
know it's just so like just put glue
Huffer my face and started going what do
you really like it what if you're like
dance and you rise the bagua chin to my
forehead it is very hard like I like the
wait till the glue gets kind of tacky
oh my god so turn you back now set it Oh
is gonna be much more difficult than I
anticipated you know I never thought I'd
be making another video that require
prayers for my face but we're doing it
don't judge me I'm just literally just
taking with it everyone has different
dreams okay and this one's mine I can
see my own disappointment in the
reflection of the right stuff boy your
time needs you saw me out like this you
wouldn't be like wow I want to talk to
her I hope she's okay I don't and ye
laughing you're doing it so well thank
you I didn't come here to fuck around do
you think I can get like glue poisonings
that I just realized that I'm gonna have
to cover my entire face and glue like in
this bag for you yeah I don't think it
is like why wear a necklace or like
earrings when you can just add Advil
your own face I can't really move like
what's that beautiful or what
what this is like white easier than
putting on lashes that's for sure if I
was doing this with my hands I think it
would be hard but it's not a lot people
on the internet fool you this shit's
fucking easy this is over why because in
the humor outside match the inside what
does a razor to your face Norelco please
rely on my name ha me okay so for our
wedding
someday we're agreeing on face Frank
them if I'm allowed to have a lot of
those fathers do although I'm meeting a
kid blonde and Dutch in the girl blonde

feel so good Oh baby you like it yes
