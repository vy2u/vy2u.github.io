started yet
hey what's up guys I'm Jenna I'm 30 it's
my last week of being 30 so I figured
it's time to complete all of my beauty
dreams beauty community when you got
accept me as one of y'all okay I'm just
gonna have to keep working on okay I can
be beautiful too I am on a never-ending
quest to be the most beautiful person in
the world when I was younger my stepmom
used to take me to the nail salon that
she went to and they had a thing called
paraffin wax and it like makes your skin
really soft but whatever it needs to go
they would dip your hands like a couple
times and they put plastic bags around
your hands and they go alright sit like
that so it can absorb into your skin or
whatever even though it doesn't do
anything it just seals your hand shut I
was always like I want to dip more I'm
going complete my beauty goals
we'll just to get my very own paraffin
bath it's called right after my marinara
bad and I'm just gonna do everything
that I want with a paraffin bath here we
go BB I need a nice I'll take one fuck
me up BAM in a knife please when I was
at the beauty supply store I did not
realize that this said it came with this
bonus six pounds of paraffin so I bought
like a lot I think we're not gonna run
out of paraffin what Jillian always cut
towards yourself well you look really
close at work yo don't you stab my bad
wait why did you get these big guys whoa
all of my fucking dreams are coming true
that's making me crazy
what's this for I can't get these out
what the fuck is well this is a lot yeah
paraffin wax should completely melt at
approximately 2.5 to 3 hours I did not
anticipate it taking three fucking hours
but here we go I'll see you in like two
and a half three hours don't you snap me
some nudes while we leave
I was an agonizing wait but I think it's
mostly melted who s the start dipping
I'm so excited right now
you only see these at a spa and I have
one in my house y'all I think it might
be really hot but after the phrase oh
that's really hot
after the first layer it's not like it's
gonna matter see look at look how nice
and thick and luscious and beautiful
that one's still wet stop ruining my
creation feel good get the fuck out so I
can have fun please hundred layers of
paraffin wax oh hell yeah
paraffin flipping me off I look like
Hamburger Helper okay this feels like
the kind of thing that I shouldn't be
able to go into Sally beauty in just by
like every time I go in there they're
like do you have a Sally card I'm like
no can I have six pounds of fucking
paraffin wax please my favorite part
about the paraffin is that it's reusable
you drop it back in are you gonna put
your nasty dead skin in there it's
contaminated get out of the salon okay
see what we're not gonna do is make
giant balls of dead skin clay and
rolling around on the table all right so
I'm gonna let my hand dry through a
little bit but I have big plans that we
need to move on to you know what I'm
saying
so I read on the internet and I saw some
videos that you can put paraffin wax on
your face so good thing I put on a full
face of makeup but my skin's being kind
of problematic from all the basketball
that I've been playing so I'm just gonna
go ahead and give my face a nice little
paraffin wax treatment oh boy this hot
now don't forget that paraffin wax
really does nothing for your skin
whatsoever except trap
everything that's on your skin inside of
your skin so I'm trying to become one
with my foundation you know what I'm
saying I'm trying to lock in my picture
finishing spray whoo boy I'm paraffin
wax my makeup on my face clogged pores
City here I come it actually feels so
fucking nice though laughing
imagine the power of this in the wrong
hands those of my hands what it's hard
to do this clean because it sort of
solidifies in the air before I even get
it to my face so it's coming out very
splashy there's no dip by faces see why
would I ever go to a nail salon know
that I have this not like I get my nails
done anyway I like my nails like I like
my life a mess
I want a paraffin my eyes shut what's
coming off on my chin don't you love it
can't move my face just drove in your
mouth what about my eyebrows what what
do you mean oh my god what cuz it's
chunky
[Laughter]
wait what I wanted to look dirty I
wanted to look amazing and beautiful I'm
trying to get new clients to muscle on
my Chin's coming up just trying to do a
beautiful treat on my skin and I have a
basketball game tomorrow are you judging
me okay who would choose on someone's
face like everyone else a nice
considerable cog is the new genre
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
so I thought a really good idea no good
ideas ever come from my brain I thought
really good ideas since my yes you're
gonna be made of wax is to go ahead and
put some candle wax on the end so I can
have a fire here okay can you let me cut
the wicks down a little I like em high
no no no no no it's fuckin beaners
oh my chin fell off so now I'm just
gonna solidify these beautiful wicks
onto my hand because this is something
they will not let you do with this along
because they clearly don't like fun it's
gonna be the new rage y'all it's called
the fire manicure here in jealous rescue
salon we did not care about your safety
anyone elses safety or the fire code do
not try this at home this is only for
trained professionals that went to
cosmetology school like myself that did
bitch cuz what I don't want is for the
wick to be on fire and come off my hand
what you don't like fun they're gonna
melt my hands right am i throwing myself
a birthday party right now I've been
mentioning thing I've invented a thing
that's never existed before as far as I
know happy birthday to me look at
they're almost at the bottom Julian Oh
five years
welcome to Jenna's ratchets lungs he
would give you fire hands once we give
you a bath in where extremism
dangerous only for the bravest and
clients oh hell yeah oh yeah are you
impressed or what oh that's hot
oh it's getting hot oh okay and they
started melting down towards my finger
like look at my ring finger see how its
melting into my finger now I just have
these nasty notes heel porn look at that
feels so good
oh is it
it feels glowing I'm starting to get
that like itchy makeup feeling under it
what else can we do pin here need to be
a nice boy you fucking wild opener close
oh hell yeah do you think if we left the
banana in here long enough it would cook
oh is it disgusting you could put a wick
on it no it's kind of a candle put an
ice cube in not a salad when all right I
want to see it happens put it in Oh
it's covered in wax before it melted Wow
that's fucking that's supposed to get
this chunky cuz they're maybe not
supposed to be a banana wow it's still a
banana that's the ice in the water in
the last
go away man what a good day at the spa
I mean that's really it that's really
all I wanted to do this has been
bothering me for like 15 years to be
able to just dip and dip and dip in
paraffin wax completely unsupervised so
I feel like my dreams and goals are
accomplished make sure you subscribe to
my channel I put interviews every
Wednesday slash Thursday and don't
forget that I invented fucking candle
hands ok as far as I know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
