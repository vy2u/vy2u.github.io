world is out there doing beautiful
people things trying to ever make
themselves look even more beautiful it
is the never-ending quest I'm just out
here try to make myself look like a
human asshole I feel like the last time
I fucked myself up who was when I gave
myself a perm which really honestly
lasted like a couple of shampoos it was
cool for a minute but I'm just left with
this dry awful chemical residue so as
you can understand I'm like itching to
do a little something-something to
myself to make myself even more human
ass holy it's my kink in life you know
what I'm saying and much like when I
shave my eyebrows like I don't have a
lot of eyebrow to the you know people
were shocked they were like why the fuck
are you doing that like I didn't invent
it it's a thing
so is this which is when you bleach your
eyebrows bleach blonde when I went to my
beauty supply store I was like I need
something to bleach my brows with and
they were like here's this cream bleach
that people use on their eyebrows than
their facial hair and stuff and I was
like no no okay
5s right in college was obsessed with
bleaching her mustache and that shit
comes out orange pumpkin orange pumpkin
spice fucking orange and that's not what
I'm going for
okay I'm going for bleach blonde lady
gaga wait I want it to blend in with my
translucent skin okay I wouldn't just be
not here from here up I'm gonna bleach
these then I'm like you know what let's
even out that look a little bit let's
bleach the our sideburns like here like
I want it I want these like bleach

know you guys are like oh my god like
what if it's awful what if you hate it
what if you have to see people this
weekend which I do I'm gonna be at the
University of Kentucky which one ever
have to see people I just had the
unstoppable urge to fuck myself up in
the face I have a plan B when I was the
little girl I used to see commercials
for this product just boom it and I was
always like I feel very excluded I would
like to try them as women okay so I
didn't look it up but I'm not sure how
many tutorials and reviews that I've
just been
because as far as I'm concerned it
should be just women my plan B is that
if I bleach my hair and it looks
god-awful I'm go fix e with round just
VIN it and I also I kind of low-key you
want to try it you know how people
bleach like their mustache I want to try
and giving myself a mustache win just
movement because I got it because I'm
gonna use it and I am the wind what do
you think is the manage it so first
thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna mix
together my bleach now I watched a video
with miss fame and he had level 20
developer because since I'm gonna put
this on my face I don't want it to also
lift my skin away you know nothing says
thanks for inviting me to your school
quite like chemical burns on your face
I'm gonna measure out my developer all
right why don't I do my eyebrows first
because they're only gonna take like 5
minutes
so this Oh God my favorite guy at the
beauty supply store was like put some
Vaseline around your eyebrow before you
bleach it for safety and other reasons
and I was like yeah totally and then I
realized that I was lying because I
don't fucking feel like it so we just go
put it on there oh oh you so because I
guess the heat that your face makes this
is only gonna take like 5 minutes
oh it's in there bitch it's fuckin in
there
I feel better already I love fucking
myself up it feels good it feels
cathartic you know people that have like
the same hair in same shit they entire
life like bitch I cannot relate I don't
know what that is I don't know her she
doesn't even go here like this is a good
book like I wish I could die than this I
like this no why I think this is a good
look it's not LinkedIn I could still see
my dark hairy eyebrows set a timer for 5
minutes my face burns
yeah hell yeah Julian I have a lot of
bleach air you know just I'm divorcing
you know what would I have to do to
myself for you to be like get out I
don't care like you honestly have no
issue with me just constantly fucking
myself up yeah what if I wanted to get
like a full face tattoo of someone
else's face on top of my face or like a
small portrait of like yeah like a tiny
portrait of Meryl Streep what would you
think about that
tasteful like semi nude semi-nude street
I would marry right now I'm really
excited I'm gonna bleach like this part

home weekend DIY it looks beautiful I
can see oh yeah I can already tell I'm
gonna dye them again oh yeah but there's
like hairs in there that are like not
bleached
skin is how it irritated it is the
chemical burn this is the definition of
a chemical burn does it hurt yes you
know it's nothing a little concealer

so concerned about like safety and like
looking okay fuck oh oh that one looks
nice

very cute that one's like pumpkin spice
girl you know who you fight in I think
that that's fucking cool oh this one got
fucked I'm like moderately pleased with
how this came out
now I want to move on to the beautiful
snow owl tutorial don't give me that
look
this is a judgment-free zone I feel like
I see a lack of people with just this
particular part of their hair dyed well
let's all just remember that this hair
is incredibly damaged the worst case
scenario is that this just breaks off
like this is what I really want bleach
right here is all of this see that yeah
this is definitely on my scalp my scalp
I mean my face
31 and I have a basketball game tomorrow
fuck yeah it's getting everywhere little
more on the brows a little more Lin have
a lot of bleach in Vivi
watch out all yours eyebrow tinting
businesses about to go out of business
what do you think that's my girl smash
her pets
I feel like bleach is addictive can I
get some research studies on how
addictive bleaches because I feel like
it is and I feel like I have a problem
it's really burning right now bleach on
your face challenge every time I go into
that beauty supply store that guy should
be like get out I like it though I like
I really like it that's what I think
look at that I feel like that looks
beautiful this 20 volume developer
really isn't lifting all of the absolute
ass that is all over my hair this either
needs to stay in here for the rest of my
life to get this bleach or it would need
a higher developer to get it bugs
looking a little bit but in the meantime
I'm gonna use some just foam in the fuck
you just mix them and make a color no do
not mix with a bristle in okay fine like
everybody has like little peach fuzz on
their skin I'm trying to make mine more
pronounced I want it to be like that
girl is not only a snow owl that girl
has a moustache look at what they tell
you to do what the fuck is this just the
fucking min oh wait is it I'm a man what
I'm just gonna try and brush it on
Mama's - because I feel like it's always
been a goal of mine - and you fucking
face just from it it's like black bits
happening
what is this listen ladies okay
says you need to get out there and
bleach your unwanted hair just go out
there and dye it darker you know what
I'm saying it really it doesn't look
right you have to run your baseball game
right now son why is it like getting
darker please don't have a poop Steve
what Juliet even cover it up with makeup
sometimes you borrow your boyfriend
bleach your Aryan it doing there like
side rat tails okay it's gonna be a
thing what's the problem
is it my mustache it's fine wait so is
that just her men's secret they just
like dye your skin a little it's really
not bad I feel like I can get it off
if you worked zoom in like super close
there's some hairs on there that I feel
like are a little brown there's only one
thing left to do now what are you doing
what are you doing getting rid of my
mustache that's a little brown just for
men I beg to differ
I'm a woman and I made it work on me
all right this bleachers just gonna
irritate my skin oh I guess I wouldn't
really recommend just for many your
mustache because all it does is really
just dye your skin Brown but I'm not
upset that I tried it because it's been
a childhood dream of mine to use just
for men because I don't like feeling
excluded you know I'm saying carrot
cakes all night we gonna do it because
this is a will except it does look like
hair it doesn't look like a mustache it
just looks like I have shit on my face
what
son shut your mouth and your mustache
don't do that song tonight should pass
friendship what trying to black out the
pain yeah they call me dangerous lady
close how does it look
I'm gonna go upstairs and I'm going and
wash this out and dry it
maybe condition it maybe cut it off
we'll see what happens Mike it so I'm
like I'm pretty disappointed with how
the sideburns turned out I definitely
need a higher volume developer in order
to get these like bleach blonde look at
this this red lake literally gave that
bleach the finger and was like get
fucked on my roots it did lift a little
bit I think I look like a very rare and
interesting fish but I do really enjoy
the brows I think that this is like a
look they are kind of oranjee I did put
a little concealer in there but after I
washed my face most of the irritation
went down I think if I bleached these a
little bit more to get them like white
weight and got my brows like wait wait
this would be pretty good but I like the
brows just for the record though if you
ever just want to dye your mustache with
just for men don't worry you can bleach
it after or just shave it I wanted to do
it how do I look like snow it's like an
interesting look what the fuck is wrong
with her
is she okay look I also feel like I
learned about myself that if I mix up a
batch of bleach for one purpose
something else is getting bleached hide
your hair hide you man hide everything
cuz I'm gonna bleach it oh I have some
like pink dye upstairs thank you your
worship I think that's just you that's
kind of that's gotta fucking cool
sideburns straight up do I look like a
snow owl
I look like a fuck out I feel like I
just I kind of look like a hairy old man
excited for my new look I wonder how
long it's gonna last
I do not know like I fuck with this hope
that my face doesn't burn for too much
longer because it's borderline
unbearable guys make sure you subscribe
to my channel I put interviews every
Wednesday / Thursday and book yeah I'm
gonna go live my leg this concludes
Jenna's ratchet salon bleaching your
eyebrows the painful way bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
