at a time conference since you guys let
me make a 12 minute rant about avocados
last week that no one wanted and no one
asked for typical Jeff I decided that
this week I wanted to do something that
has been requested a lot in case you
guys haven't seen the first one
oftentimes when you asked me to do
challenges I'll take like a bunch of
them and mash them up into one thing
called a challenge mashup if I don't
think that they should be like their own
whole video but it doesn't make people
request them any less so I wanted to
take a bunch of challenges some that I
made up some that I found on the
internet during weird internet time and
a couple of popular ones that you guys
have been requesting so hopefully this
will make those of you happy that
requests this and then I post some shit
about avocados as you guys also know I'm
really good at collaborating with other
youtubers which is why I thought I'd
take a break from collaborating with
youtubers and have a very special guest
join me here she is Kylie Jenner

Kylie and I just did a video together it
was on her app or we had Kermit and
Norman meet each other and to evening
