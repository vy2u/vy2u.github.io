facebook what you guys wanted to see and
someone suggested actually that i
refresh my ends here and I've been
thinking about what to do with my hair
because seven months ago I dyed my hair
a semi-permanent navy blue color and
this is the result of seven months of
not touching it I think we can all agree
that the terms semi-permanent is
absolute bullshit this is here forever
so I was looking on YouTube for some
ideas about what to do to the ends of my
hair and I came across like an entire
genre of videos of people just getting
blue dye out of their hair which is
apparently thing and I came across this
channel called offbeat look and three
years ago she posted a video about how
if you crushed up vitamin C tablets and
mix it with shampoo and do that a couple
times like massage it it apparently gets
some of the blue out without having to
read bleach it because I know you guys
want me to do insane things to my hair
but I've been growing it out and it's so
healthy and so nice and I'm really
enjoying it so I'm trying to just do
this thing where I let it go out like
any rational hairdresser I imagine would
be like chop this shit off and just
start over it's like having somebody on
you softball team that's not very good
but they're good 15 morale let's not cut
them let's keep them so it's like pretty
healthy but I don't want to bleach it
again and I don't want to cut it I just
want to like make it fun and fresh for
summer you know because it's it's very
pretty I like it I don't hate it but I
would like it to be like a little
fresher so I want to delve into a
territory that I've never been one I
want to try that vitamin C treatment
that she suggests it we crush these up
we mix it with shampoo we massage it and
then we see what happens then my plan a
is to I've never used a toner in my life
I am so excited at the idea that if I
got some of this blue out I could maybe
tone it into a color that was like a
silvery ash I think that's very
ambitious I think it would be like a
green gray ash if we're being real
and then my plan B is to just throw some
purple on there which I read this bottle
and apparently I died that hair I did
that hair my brain no I was reading this
bottle and this apparently glows under
black light I don't have a black light
to test
what I think it would be cute though if
our hair matched each other this isn't
what I dyed your hair with but I mean
it's similar to what it looks like now
right if we had matching hair you're
expecting it look this good
expect disappointment so yeah I'm I'm
going to try and lift the blue see what
happens don't have high hopes for it I
think bleach is really the only thing to
get rid of this and then we'll try and
tone it and then if I hate it we'll dye
it purple so basically my hair is gonna
go through a lot today take a moment of
silence for the torture I'm about to put
my hair through your hair I'm so sorry
love Jenny the good thing about vitamin
C is that unlike bleach like it might
dry my hair out a lot which is okay but
it's not gonna damage it let's get
started beads seem like enough I'm just
gonna wrap it in this and just oh oh
it's already getting out my hair Beach
so apparently if you're gonna do with
this method just make sure you wrap it
in like 70,000 plastic bags okay there's
definitely still some like tablets in
there but I'll just oh so then she says
take some cheap shampoo so I got this
family sized bottle of swab but $2.99
each put it in here and girl you gonna
make yourself a beautiful pink
oh it was like a lot thicker
I fucked up somehow already whoops and
then we're gonna leave this on for a
little while 30 minutes hi welcome to my
salon first just dip your hair in this
shit
wait a second holy shit look at the end
maybe it's just cuz they're covered in
white pills but like that looks like
it's lifting on the ends already like
she did this treatment like a couple
times in a row you know and like let it
sit so I don't even know I just think
it'll be really cool if I could get some
of this out I could tone it into like a
silvery color so I think that'd look
pretty okay it's coming out of the ends
it really is yeah is this kind of like
lighting my brown hair very professional
way to do this this parts all blue I
feel disgusting but I am interested to
see if this works at all I just can't
believe that I dyed my hair in navy blue
said been months ago and it's still in
here
some people do something called a bleach
wash where they're like bath bleach bath
where they mix like bleach with shampoo
or conditioner or something but they're
like how to live color on your hair
without bleach okay mix bleach shampoo
yeah but that's bleach I like this
experience all right so I think that I'm
just gonna like massage this and leave
this in for 30 minutes and then we'll
wash it and see how the first round wet
if we want to do another round my pants
I got on my pants might be I smell like
B what a DIY hack no it's been about 30
minutes I've been rubbing it I can't
really tell there's so much weight stuff
in here I'm gonna rinse it and see what
it looks like and then we'll decide how
to proceed it doesn't really look like
it did a whole lot my hair down here
feels outrageously dry so dry and bad
like just real bad and I really don't
think it did like a whole ton but to be
fair the
girl and a lot of other people that have
used this say like you should do it more
than once so what do you say we double
down and do it again so we'll do it
again just to say we gave it a fair shot
like you can't blame me for trying I see
somebody that's like crush up some
vitamin C pills and it'll get the blue
out of your hair like I'm here to try it
I'm here for that yeah but bleach it
they'll probably just fall off I just I
didn't want to throw purple on here and
then have it come out like the worst
color you've ever seen you know you're
anticipating my failures that are you
saying damn it Tom I think the lesson
that I've learned over the last seven
months is that if you dye your hair and
navy blue it's just never coming out
like did you notice any difference even
in the slightest
no don't squint at me okay it's helping
a little bit stop it's been about thirty
minutes again I can tell that my hair is
just dry maybe better than bleach but
like it's real bad Finn you know what
I'm saying
feels like I might as well bleached it
the texture is disgusting just do all
that for oh if I tone it and it comes
out but is that gonna be even worse to
put the power on top of butt so what do
you think I should do I think you know
let's try the toner I've never used a
toner it's like a whole different world
I'm ready one part one part no more two
parts that was very scientific
I'm gonna do this you just slap it on
here Oh should I wear gloves it's too
late now just forget it
am i doing what even is toner even this
honestly might be like my worst hair
video of like what not to do ever it's
so wet why is it so wet I don't get it I
can already tell that this isn't doing
anything at all
which means like if you have blue green
stuck in your hair your choice is to
bleach it or diet something else or cut
it off cuz none of this is working so
use enough of this I don't know how this
work it's like a bottle of cologne like
what is it six years just set a timer
for six years four years Julian
it's been 30 minutes and I can tell
nothing is gonna happen
look it's exactly the same I've never
spent this much time doing absolutely
nothing to my hair it's like when you
like do a braid for like an hour and
then either side you hate it at the end
it's like that times dead I'm gonna
rinse this out it's time to execute Plan
B and I hope that all of plan a didn't
ruin Plan B but where we gonna throw
that purple in here I need a fresh
summer look and I'm not gonna let this
bullshit get in my way
wait did I just start the video or have
I been making it for hours look I
watched the Turner now isn't it a
shocking transformation
I feel sad aren't you glad that I had a
plan B rule number one of being a Virgo
is you always prepare for worst-case
scenario all the time oh it says shampoo
hair then dry
that's your day that bit really it feels
worse than the time that I burned it
really yeah you want to feel it oh my
god this is the way you do hair right
you separate separate it into two large
sections and just do it I started off
this purple doesn't go in my hair I'm
going to lose it oh this doesn't look
like is dyeing my hair at all what even
is this what did i buy did I done fucked
up
it looks like it's just turning it blue
again it's turning blue it's literally
just darker blue wait bitch what I have
some hair fall do you want that honestly
yeah but you have extra purple a little
bit mix with conditioner is it cuz I
just toned it and it's not like sinking
in they're gonna use me as like a
tutorial in beauty school where they're
like this is what happens when you use a
toner before I color am i oh no but then
at least you will have help someone in
the making of this speech no I thought I
was buying purple dye oh oh
just squirt some in there alright Julian
lent me some of his dye mixed with
conditioner so we can try to make this
work at least there's like die in here
always so oh oh that's better right
that's gonna be purple but there's like
so much stuff it's like not evenly
coating it oh oh be just a disaster
Beach to look cute yeah how did a fuckup
this bad I'd be really out here doing
dumb shit it's finally caught up to me
all of my dumb decisions I'm paying for
them I can't get any color to saturate
this strand why would i lighten it to do
this so Dom it's been a minute though
since my hair's been Purple's very
exciting
oh good there's like spots in here that
are just still blue oh it's gonna look
weird and janky
it looks like shit
something tells me my technique really
isn't gonna pay off this time this is
starting to look better or worse
really I guess just like the vitamins
theme gonna sit here and try and rub
this into these blonde bits hope I come
out with some sort of result that makes
any sense whatsoever I'm hoping I can
pull out a win all right
well I'll see you back in like 30
minutes and then the time it takes to
wash it out and dry it will see what I
done did I think it looks nice
you better boy because this is all I got
I like I love it I think that it looks
so much better than the super faded blue
green even though that was nice like to
a point there's definitely some parts in
here that my strategy of just creating
two parts and glop in some hair dye on
has done me dirty but you know I think
it's dimensional it's hair couture it's
one-of-a-kind couldn't be created even
if you tried Beach I like this color
because I know that this fades too
although I promise you even if this
washes out you will still see that
Bluegreen underneath here it's gonna
hang on until forever Beach so I think
it's really nice for summer to have like
a nice updated color on the bottom which
allows me to healthily grow out the rest
of my hair yes it looks like I did it
myself but you know what I'm free bitch
you don't have a black light but I am
curious if it would glow under a black
light at all I do love purple though I
think it's a very flattering color on
literally almost everyone the salon
always pulls it out the salon always
pulls it out
this is definitely a tutorial of what
not to do when you could very simply
just put some purple on your ends and I
still managed to fuck that up and the
whole entire beginning of this video is
like stuff that just doesn't need to
happen
Wow now we matter you jealous speech I'm
coming for you well it was almost a fail
and I was really worried and I was also
worried that between the toner and the
color like my hair was gonna start
falling off
yeah strongly focused please don't leave
me any comments about everything I did
wrong I already know and it's not like
I'm gonna learn my lesson but I hope you
guys like to watch me do this and I
honestly was incredibly curious if that
vitamin C thing worked on blue dye it
worked a little I want to say that it
actually worked a little bit but like at
what expense I should have just thrown
purple in there but I was worried that
if I just put the purple on over the
blue it was gonna be muddy and brown so
I did a good job and you know it pay me
pay me I'm like a brunette
bird-of-paradise
a brunette bird-of-paradise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
