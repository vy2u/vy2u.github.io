the haircutting scissors me bitch I know
some y'all I just burnt out on me doing
beautiful people things but guess what
this is what genuinely makes me happy in
life and for the last year and a half
I've been diligently going to beauty
night school every night and I have
finally graduated nervous yes I have
what are you doing what are you doing
what are you doing why did you how
fucking old are you come here
come don't put that paper in your mouth
don't spit it at me I will you
understand that I have scissors today
right show them your hair today is my
first time being without having to pull
my pants all the way down to my ankles
she remember when I gave Julian a
Brazilian Blowout then he went got it
bleached like days later and dyed pink
so now his pink has faded and he said
Jenna will you graciously allow me to
come to your badges salon so you can cut
and color my hair to cut with you you're
not allowed to come here anymore for
being disrespectful
this is where my videos are always late
stop trying to hit my lens I will cut
you with the scissors pushing me away
stop marker all over yourself what are
you doing he asked me you think you
could like give me a little bit of a
trim and I was like I do not know how to
cut hair you know that but I went to the
beauty supply store and I was like y'all
sell cutting scissors and she was like
yeah bitch right here and I was like do
I need a license for those cuz those
look like fancy scissors I don't know
why I thought you needed a hairdressing
license to buy hairdresser scissors
they're just fucking scissors
I can't happen I'm dumb I'm not only
going to color Julian's hair I will give
him a little bit of a trim but this
whatever happens like you're it's you're
signing your life away to me I feel like
I'm evolving okay I went from fucking
myself up to fucking other people up I
am IBEW to burr so my vision for
Julian's hair is I'm gonna do what's
called a shadow root or like when we put
color into the bottom and then it fades
to a lighter color I've never done it
usually it's like oh you did pretty good
I I feel like I've got a strong chance
of this nut coming out super great can I
give you a bowl cut today's the day 100%
not so the colors that I got are this
like colors that I got too so I got a
purple and a pink it's like a royal
purple sort of in a light bubblegummy
pink and she did sell me on a clear in
case I wanted to delete either of the
colors I'm not sure I want to do that
it's like having a child someday if I
wanted to go to beauty school would you
support me financially because I'm gonna
be a kpop star by then because of my
haircut that's an American if anything
it will look like
tie-dye II you know cuz that says
expensive and professional it's just
like getting in all the other hair stop
moving I just said I haven't even moved
do you ever watch Dateline I really yeah
this is so fucking hard why it's just
like painting here yeah but like if any
of it gets in the long part then it dies
the whole strand you know when you walk
into a business and you're like hey is
this Chipotle and they're like no that's
next door and you're like I mean this
business is kind of tight I'll stay here
that's how I feel
Julian what did the barista say to his
annoying nagging wife when she just
wouldn't leave home alone why don't you
stop French pressing my buttons than
they divorced you talking to me please
are you ready for something don't call
it a comeback so I don't know how to do
this
fuck I'm not sure that this pink is
actually gonna dye your hair any type of
color I feel like this isn't like a joke
anymore like I'm a professional all
right I mean it looks cool but it is
definitely blending with the purple so
we let it sit right what do you do well
it's it's it's better shot pink it's
literally called pink kiss and your hair
was like that was the most bleached part
was sort of the end are you rubbing that
into my skin oh yeah what the hell I was
getting it off we're gonna let you sit
and then you're gonna go bottomless a
shower right and then I'll cut your hair
which is what I'm actually looking
virgins I've never cut hair because I'd
cut my own beans and I'm still paying
for that choice Julian just said do you
want to turn on the camera get your
reaction like something happen you right
all you do is rinse it oh boy come show
us want me to cut it wet it looks really
cool though like it didn't come out
super muddy I don't hold bright but that
pink definitely didn't fucking show up
sit let's see let's assess okay we got
some stone wrong purple boots happening
in the back some mediocre purple roots
happening in the front is it bad
it's the real home done this part isn't
purple at all here but like you got a
big blotch of that up there gosh I don't
think that's a word I want to hear when
I describe my hair
Oh your hair let's just protect the left
side we're done American Horror Story
Jenna's salon shit you straight-up
cutting my hair look at you got style
and flair - okay how's my answer why
have you never really country here
before cuz you don't our it's amazing I
feel like I would pay people to let me
cut their hair that's so bizarre we're
off SCANA look at your hair next time
I'd be like bitch who the fuck cut your
hair he's gonna know oh I poked myself I
want to go back to the safe ones
hairdressers are you cringing or are you
excited because I can cut hair now
everybody losing a fucking job you want
shorter in the front really shorter in
the front really little shorter up top
no I'm pretty happy with the way all
right now I'm just I'm gonna style it
and then you wanna do a hair tour yeah
so Julian I'm gonna do a hair tour
really quick so you guys can see just
how bad I done disses the roots are sort
of purple like in places in the back it
definitely looks like a lot more of what
I intended if this came out like way
brighter pink I think it would like be
more successful but this color is sort
of like the color that your hair was
and this is like sort of blotchy but
like the purple roots in here came out
okay but it didn't translate through the
front let me see your face and forward
just so like face on you just sort of
look like almost exactly this no I think
it looks like I got my hair dyed purple
two weeks ago right yeah which is the
look but like I wanted purple Ruth and
paint tips and this is a GD mess I like
that look and if I was able to bring it
in a little more it was the first time
it was a good solid fucking try I think
that looks cool but unfortunately it
just is not what we want it to look like
right I would be down with okay this is
so much easier to just do it this way
now welcome to Jenna's actual ratchet
salon where we really this way your
tagline should be cut color improvise
color fuck it let's color again here
this is the big trend right now so they
just like dumped it on the top of your
head don't stop I almost Galoob purple
all down your neck BAM they're exquisite
technique I only have one glove left
because you shredded the other one what
can I say I'm a dog okay I mean this is
the easiest thing to do color dumping on
like you're just lucky that your head
was bleached beforehand cuz if you had
any bleacher you would be both yeah you
are now a purple miss that feel feels
like you're tugging on my hair so this
is Rob sue because my shadow root
technique was very very bad I was gonna
have a plan B in life welcome to my
library this is my book club work today
we're gonna be Winnie the Pooh gone
wrong where he loses his friends he
loses his family he takes acid and he
doesn't know who he is I'm recording a
book club here could you get out

winning to the pool gone wrong don't got
it if you could please let it roll for
maybe like a couple hours I would
appreciate it Jenna it's so how you feel

different it's so bratty yeah it's
really bright I know this that brand is
the one that I used to dye my hair red
and then it fade it's about really
pretty like rose gold so I think this

a little while that's it it took me like
four shampoos to get at all I mean it's
still coming out am i gonna it's gonna
bleed on no likey yeah it's gonna bleed
