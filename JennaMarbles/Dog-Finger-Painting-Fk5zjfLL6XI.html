hey it's getting hot out it's kind of
summertime and I wanted to do something
fun that I could do with my dogs
all right had the genius idea that maybe
I could let them finger paint it's you
happens this is really more like out of
mildly enjoy your dogs part two of the
painting edition but I'm gonna see if I
can get them to finger paint we got some
kids safe washable finger paints some
sponges and paint brushes and some dog
treats so we're just really will thing
it then cherish it forever if you're
bored
maybe you can get your dog to
outside somewhere you can clean it up
and rinse it off and then we're gonna
draw they need a bath and if this
doesn't work then fuck you guys are
these thieving little penis okay so the
guy is the store that the decided that
have kids safe but you shouldn't let
them eat it because then they will have
colorful performances
no color performing live no woah-oh we
all came up so fast and we're outside on
my patio something hopefully if they get
this like ever everything just hose off
the whole patio
get them inside somehow it's a bad color
we don't want is around oh yes Oh
we do brothers doing yeah he's been
sentiment support and you are not I
thought for sure that curve would be so
much better at this would be such a good
a painting is for sale for our million
dollars oh yeah so if your bar didn't
you and your pet boys have some fun
together you should just get up a feeder
paint but then make them pay teeth give
it to mom okay surprise mom already got
you a birthday person
subscribe to jail for losing one day
