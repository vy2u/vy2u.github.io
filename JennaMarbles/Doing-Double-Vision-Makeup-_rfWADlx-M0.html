one of the most requested videos in
recent memory correct me in the comments
if I'm wrong but I think dopes to
one-one-one pioneered this look where
she puts like a set of eyes under her
eyes and like a set of lips under her
lips it's a double vision makeup look
and you guys just flooded me with tweets
and stuff when this came out and you
said that you really wanted me to do it
and I know it's taken me a minute okay
but I think I'm gonna do it but I found
one that looks a little more ambitious
it's by Roxas horas it's called trippy
vision illusion Halloween makeup and she
has not two sets of eyes but when to buy
five sets of ice and what appear and
then two extra sets down here so you
just look like a human spider yeah you
go by but because the third eye is
always very season jokes actually on me
because it's always hairy season okay
Mary I'm gonna be the most elegantly
just fighting you better see oh well I
mean I feel like the reason why I didn't
just like jump and do it when you guys
were tweeting it at me non-stop which I
appreciate I've seen it is because I'm
not sure I can do it like it looks hard
like it requires skills I'm not sure is
that so first things first she starts
off with an eyeliner pencil in brown
which I don't have but I do have a brow
it's my like creepy old lady eyes are
really not having a great time yeah
great yo lady eyes you know I'm a human
crepe yeah this is a place on my face I
understand so this is making like a full
little brow right here I'll link the
video in the description
Jim for those of y'all that actually
wants to watch someone talented no this
Heike fucking hurts Peter always feed
them answers so then she starts like
outlining the eye
underneath the eye I'm terrified to fail
at this cuz then it's gonna ruin the
illusion speed of mustache oh ho it's
speeding them in sling it heath whim is
that look good I mean yeah cuz then the
ones up here are bigger I'm not that
artistic like I can't fucking draw
I feel like this eyes pointing down
those uneven Wow
those are free people wait does omegle
still exist you don't stop him gonna
start sweating my eyes off if I were to
draw these like my own brows I would
just have to like squirrel real fucking
hard cuz - sheep like pieces of shit I'm
literally a one time I went to get my
eyebrows waxed and she I went in there
like bare face like with my eyebrows and
she just looks at eyebrows and goes show
me honey bunches of oats lady that just
what happens to sometimes look like Liza
Kochi it's just that like this face
where she's like looks like Liza it gets
me every time but she just starts like
putting it in he'll I don't even fuck
with Instagram not the platform for me
divert and I know you were we've been
together forever what do you want to do
this weekend you want to sit around and
get to know each other it's not a
euphemism that's it I'm so not talented
enough for this does this look like a
nose I feel like people that do this and
like it looks really good have much like
more even skin
I do like there's literally lines and
wrinkles going through my fucking eyes
I've had a lot of work done not did you
see that thread going around about
people wanting to fund a flat earther
reality show or they just search for the
end of the earth it would never end real
looking like the speed of your dream
yeah cuz mine are mostly pencil boxes
are dude this is fucking hard all the
wings aren't even me what's that look
like a blue pencil but I did bring down
a teal lipstick it's so hard to draw a
tiny face onto your face oh no my top
has a cut guide what when I was little I
really wanted brown eyes because I feel
like you can wear like almost no makeup
and your eyes just sort of stand out but
not me I just had these like light eyes
light skin I just look dead all the time
it's crazy
also no their eyes yeah I told you the
top that's what's looking into another
dimension how do I fix that this is
getting so bad I'm making a fucking mess
oh looks so much better than mine so I'm
gonna face a decision in a little bit
about whether or not we're alone I
should put on lashes I'm gonna draw em
first and then if I feel like it doesn't
look good I'll put some on but I feel
like that's gonna make it look a little
worse how do I look like a speedo
you look like eyes on everyone this is a
cock I
yeah by the other eye yes not click now
we put in the pupil oh she's got this
like liquid white eyeliner that I just
do not have oh my god the nose needs to
go right over my nose Skye don't you
just call it in my scar school Skype oh
ma I give me I guess that's okay
thank you it's actually much better than
what that is wild it's not right it's
really not that bad Julian you did a
pretty good job all right so now the
question is should I put lashes on my
face or now yeah I feel like this
doesn't look like hers at all
why are you looking at me like I've
fucked up so I need to make lips under
my lips that look like my lips I'm not
think my lips is small as hell we don't
have a lot to draw it doesn't look as
good as ours that's why we people like
oh my god you have to do this I'm like
it only looks good cuz they're
incredibly good at makeup must really
not that good yeah they're not even the
same color this one's looking somewhere
else she doesn't want to be here is me
spider beat face tour here's my first
set of eyes my seconds that
my third set of eyes my fourth set of
eyes yes that's okay that's the craziest
angle
I like failed miserably at the nose I
needed Julian to help me I wouldn't
exactly call it a success yeah you want
me to go on that app and see if anyone
gets scared now that I'm looking at it
really for the first time it looks like
a fucking mess oh well actually looks
better if I do that no one wants to talk
to me he said I had so many fucking eyes
it's my first time on here too I have
eight eyes I don't know who that is who
is she
I'm so flattered even with all these
eyes I will and I'll see you someday
when we get married that is so
flattering data is my ideal man I'm an
octopus just looking around that's why
these eyes don't look very realistic
well I did it I tried it I am not that
great at creating eyes because they just
look like you know round white circles
which doesn't really look like my eyes
but I tried my best I don't know you
took part giving me a participation
award cuz what are you doing looking
around yeah this is really hard if
you're not like good at drawing Thanks
well I mean it was gonna look funny
regardless you drawing eight fucking
eyes on your face it was really fun I
hope that you enjoyed this look even
though I'm not particularly skilled at
dry eyes
a lot of fun and you know we bothered
some people in the middle of the night
which I think was worth it they didn't
even see it coming but I did because I
could see into the future of beads look
at us I have a basketball game tomorrow
