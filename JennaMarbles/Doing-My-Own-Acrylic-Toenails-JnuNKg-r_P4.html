posted a video of me doing my own
acrylic nails for the very first time
was because I was watching a ton of
videos by nail career education and Suzi
herself made a response video to me
which I gotta say was one of the kindest
nicest response videos I've ever seen it
was like sweet and helpful she genuinely
cared about me and my well-being and my
technique in acrylic nails and I've
never done this on this channel where I
posted two videos very similar to each
other like within a couple weeks but I
have all this nail stuff and I don't
know what to do with it and I'm still
not done with my acrylic adventure
I wanted to let Susie know that I saw
your video I noticed that your salon you
don't offer any acrylic Tony so you know
what I'm gonna do my own acrylic toenail
are they functional no do they look good
no does anyone want them the way that
I'm going to do them no which is exactly
why I'm going to do it my acrylic nail
video I feel like I was just genuinely a
fan of the videos and I wanted to try it
I feel like the purpose of this video is
for no other reason than to stuff my
feet up also just like a little bit
upset because I have a gel panic you're
on right now and that's to take that off
watch me rough fit here is the before
the a gel pedicure like many of you said
about my acrylic nails I need to soak
some cotton pad in some acetone which I
got your acetone this time myself this
off and then we can get on with our
acrylic destiny I would apologize to
Christine from simply illogical except I
haven't seen her do her toes so I'm not
sorry Christine uh they got me a
terrible mistake already this is way too
much boy it actually hurt off to a rough
start
I'd say for sure okay so for obvious
reasons that didn't work so this is now
round two of me
just trying to get the gel off of here
what if I signed myself up for like I
don't even know what I'm doing anymore
like what is this channel am I just like
this shit of the beauty community like
I'm just the one over here just being a
shit
okay with it honestly it took longer
than anticipated but here's the other
before I'm not going to worry about all
this the little black shit in there or
like getting them whatever I'm going to
put some acrylic nails on there so fuck
it all
no the excited but I said that we do the
beak Topher I got to do my acrylic
primer just a little bit
Suzy said there we go because I can't
fit a nail form around my toe I was
thinking that maybe I just put some tips
on and then try to work around it vote
now in the comments if you think this is
a terrible idea
press one for terrible press 2 for oh my
god I'm going to do it alright so as
soon as I said just a little nail glue
just a little bit put it on there fast
as we can and fun oh my god what have I
done
oh it's like rookie oh I can't move it
oh how am I gonna walk oh oh oh my own
fault this is my fault oh it's coming up
oh thank god okay good because I want to
straighten it because that was weird
there we go all right exit Oh mmm now
it's refusing to be good hi Suzy help I
need live help oh my god like this was
just two weeks ago my fingernails just
finished coming off I don't know why I
thought that this was going to be fun
and good I'm just like praying that I
can get these off with that acetone
because I'm not I'm not gonna be able to
put shoes on tomorrow I'm not going to
cut them either like fuck it if we're
doing it we're doing it all the way
croelick liquid the ball in the paint
yeah we don't visit oh my god baby look
it there we go Oh busy EDD do you think
I'm only going to need one little ball
on here or else is going to be too sick
and then it's never coming off Oh what
happens if I like it I mean that's
pretty solid
look at that like fuck with me it's
blending into the white a little which I
don't like it's ruining the color of my
exquisite toenail got a big dent in the
middle
and it has glue on the top but like look
at how much better at God that was like
a real nail that looks like it could be
someone's toenail I don't know who's
somebody lived in their life on the edge
all right now I'm going to do some clear
but just a little bit because this was a
mistake I made last time there's just
way too much acrylic on all of it I'm
just going to go up this way just to
seal all the edges it really seal my
fate if you would soon fuck oh yeah oh
there's everything I wanted I mean I
really should have spent some more time
I guess getting also like black polish
out of my toe because it's very visible
but you know I'm going for quite a look
so does it really matter I don't think
so
I'm so pleased already oh yes oh it's a
bloodbath
alright here we go gonna make my pink
ball oh that's kind of big oh shit oh
shit oh fuck oh pray for my tongue oh no
oh that's getting bad oh that's a lot of
acrylic oh god it's on my fucking toe
hey toenails look like straight black
flash yellow oh well yeah I'm living my
all down as oh oh wait doesn't feel good
oh I touch the acrylic oh no this one is
like I glued it to like curved so when I
put my toe down lisping up very male mmm
oh God Oh luckily my Tobin how a nice
little ball is clear here we go look how
nice that is
hell yeah I mean it still doesn't feel
great all right what I'm not going to do
is glue the next nail so that it points
directly into the ground like a fucking
bird talent that is painful as fuck and
I'm never making that mistake again I'm
just going to let that one dry and then
cry about it is only go there we go
that's much better
oh God oh they're getting harder as they
get smaller you do is on the underside I
had to clean it out from under my
toenail
I was mad yes yes yes yes yes yes my
vision is coming to life oh girl I mean
I'm so
please the second one is still pointing
into the ground which is outrageously
uncomfortable but this one is much more
comfortable like it's just straight
chillin it can't touch the ground or
else I push my nail back I really hope
that this doesn't end like me going to
the ER time from now number four process
is much easier the second time around
even though I'm doing a book I really
know what I'm doing it this way I'm a
professional my finger is glued to it ah
fuck to heck maybe I'll just file it so
help rate filing pretty much helps
everything files dial you don't Mandy he
is look I don't get it it's like a piece
of hair when you curl it with a curling
iron like if you don't do it right the
first time it's like done with you
doesn't even man you know will be the
death of me now okay now it's glued to
my other toe let's just do some of this
this is like the most attractive I've
ever felt just fucking dick what's wrong
with it just try having crawling
toenails and live my life but maybe if
we just hold it like that I can just put
some acrylic on it take that
motherfucker
oh god this is terrible that work oh
it's pointing directly into the ground
sort of time to bend it up god that
looks so wrong holy heck go bend up I
should have made the been straight up
huh this is a mistake God those are
fucking disgusting
get on there hey oh that one looks
fucking wrong oh it's like the like
weird cousin that's just like pointed
sideways like my cones usually look
pretty fucking normal because they're
just little and on top when it's long
like that that is fucking disgusting
that is next-level nasty oh my god okay
let's get some acrylic on there just cuz
you twist it to the side doesn't mean I
love you any less
Oh send help what have I done
I can't walk like I can't fucking walk I
mean acrylic wise
my skill has gotten exponentially better
all it really takes is like one practice
time and then you're like good to go -
just get it on there I don't know about
all that like making it look good shit
but like I fucking did it I did it
ooh ooh that sounds really don't fucking
try this let me make mistakes for you
this feels terrible circling me it would
feel so wrong to you that looks really
nice that looks like a nail yeah girl no
I'm just cool let this dry look how far
I can spread my toes by the way that's
like a hand I'm pretty sure that Julian
is coming home in a minute so before I
try and walk or do anything I think I'm
going to wait for his reaction this is
less of a fail than my fingernails but
like this is a fuck shell I want my
boyfriend to see it because I think he's
gonna like it look at the bottom looks
like a monkey
Oh how does that feel oh there's
somebody else
Oh Oh somebody like hello
this is easy no real connection and
that's fucked off that's fucked up
why is it locked up really oh my god
just oh they're attached to my toes
really fingers yeah don't hurt her hair
our burgers are ready to like it but
long you don't fit really know anything
okay I think it looks nice they came out
really elegant there we go I can only
like I normally walk like this with all
my toes up some super bro true it's
great
look at how great you can't use your
toes it's like just having a foot with
no toes
to see like my phone ale no short answer
no long answer probably definitely no I
curl it to my foot shut that's the
reality of what I just did your um pray
for me because I don't know how can you
get these off and I unlike my
fingernails which I could function with
I can't function while these are still
on so give me your thoughts and prayers
tonight make sure you subscribe to my
channel if there is a five Thursday and
Suzie girl as you look in the higher a
foot nail technician just hit me up you
know cause like you don't offer those
services on your YouTube channel
currently and I'm pretty good and when I
lack in a license I make up for in debt
right I hope you enjoyed this I usually
wouldn't post two videos like this so
close to each other but you don't had to
get out of my system it wasn't all the
way out of my system and now it is so I
feel better now

gross I'm gonna go ahead and talk to you
