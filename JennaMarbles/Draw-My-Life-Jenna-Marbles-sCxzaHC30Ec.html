to draw my life I was born in upstate
New York and my parents had my brother
but he is really tall he's like six five
so that's in and then they had me two
years later and my dad loves Subarus and
he's also a chemist he's lots of really
cool patents for things like polymers
that I didn't even understand my mom
worked in lots of different things but
mostly is just a badass when we were
little my parents got divorced but that
worked out alright because my dad
remarried and his wife has big boobies
that I would put my face in when I'm sad
and my mom's been with her boyfriend for
like ever
so everyone wound up pretty happy
support my siblings and when I was
little I used to like to do gymnastics
dance and I played the clarinet in the
piano and I wanted to work with animals
or play soccer even though I didn't know
how to play soccer and I had love for
the animals the furry things and loved
them so much and every birthday I had a
so blow out the candles and wish for a
puppy or Kitty but I couldn't have one
because my mom was really allergic to
them but my dad got his cat and his name
was Benny
absolutely hated us and he would scratch
up our faces
that sucked but I also love to play
baseball my dad with his awesome
mustache was our coach and he taught me
everything except one year he was like
babe you should play softball I was like
why like I love baseball
he was like while you're distracting the
boys
so it's valid one of my favorite
memories from growing up we're at our
lake house and we would go swimming and
fishing canoeing and one time we were
sitting around the fire pit and a snake
came out my dad killed it with a knife
and we were like whoa dad you're such
the man and then another time I did a
backflip off a lot doc and I hit my face
on a ladder and then that's why I broke
my nose and I have that weird t-shaped
scar and my face stop making fun of me
and growing up I also had a best friend
and her name was Brittany and we did
everything together it was really sad in
seventh grade because I realized that
everywhere my school was really smart
and that made you cool and I was sort of
just regular and I took regular classes
and sort of felt like I didn't been with
everyone else so sad too
I also really like this boy who didn't
like me back and I would go weed outside
of his locker every morning before
homeroom and in one quarter were there
60 days I had 52 tardies because I was
just waiting for him in his locker and
he also used to call me flat-chested
which you see me cry but I did keep some
notes and stuff and other people
everything that's ever mattered to me in
a little shoebox because I'm sentimental
like that and when I got to high school
my best friend dropped out I was really
lonely but the ninth grade I met this
boy named Willy in gym class we wound up
dating each other for four years we
eventually broke up to go to school but
that's really nice and all my regular
people classes and regular things
decided to pay off because I went to
college and all I wanted to do was go to
big city so I didn't know what I was
going to do but I just wanted to get out
so I went to Boston was 17 I didn't know
what I want to study I didn't know
anyone had no friends my 18th birthday I
just laid in my dorm room and cried and
said Jenner was really sad but it didn't
last for too long because I played
softball and so I got lots of friends
and for the first time in my entire life
I felt comfortable being exactly who I
was
and being weird and it was the greatest
feeling ever I also got a macbook
computer and i taught myself how to edit
with imovie and used to make these funny
videos for myself but i didn't think
anyone else would ever think they're
funny then i went to grad school then I
got a master's degree and I was 22 and I
thought my life was like starting I was
so excited I mean my friend we're gonna
move to Texas and then she bailed on me
last minute and I thought my whole life
was over like you ruined everything and
now all my weird part-time jobs like
go-go dancing at bartending I'm working
a tanning salon we're my full-time jobs
and I had no job in my field and I was
so sad and confused and then one day I
was locked out of my apartment and this
boy was moving in upstairs and I was
like I've never seen you here before
and he was like I've never seen you here
before oh my god that's we can see her
moving all right whatever you're weird I
gotta go and so it jumped in through my
window and he just stood there and
watched me but I guess that was
endearing because we dated and we
inserted a little dog family together
and moved in a family and then my whole
life changed because I got a job at
barstoolsports.com the owner D portly
asked me if I wanted to be his assistant
and I cried because I was so excited and
he taught me everything about the
internet I gotta be funny and how to
blog and how everything worked
and one day I my way up from the office
I got the idea the higher trick people
into thinking you're good-looking video
so I made it and Dave even put it on the
website more people saw and I was so
excited and nervous he gave me my own
website to rank so did that like six
months except they realized that it
wasn't really making me happy and I
wanted to make videos and he sort of
knew that too but we could never see eye
to eye and sort of ended badly but
and then I was back to really sad Jenna
no job no direction don't know what I'm
doing so I just decided to make videos
again after six months I'm not doing it
because that's all I like doing and then
I found the YouTube community this cool
amazing group of people that had these
awesome videos except they all lived in
Los Angeles and I looked at Boston so I
went to visit and I loved it and then a
year later I saved up enough money and
asked max to go with me and he did and
so we moved to sunshine land that is you
guys know Max and I broke up about four
months ago and it was really sad and
it's been really hard because I don't
really know anyone here life is
complicated you never know what's going
to happen but if it's meant to be it'll
be and if it's not it won't
but now I'm sad Jana again and I don't
know what I'm doing and I think if I had
it all figured out I would be doing
something wrong because I think it makes
it so that you can't grow and you have
to be confused in life or else he won't
grow but all I know is that YouTube
makes me really happy and all of you
make me really happy and without your
love and support I would be lost and I
always thought that if you have someone
you love or something you love their
life would be easy but it's not and I
still have no idea what I want to do
with my life I'm more confused now than
I've ever been but your love and support
has changed my entire life and just
seeing your comments I realized all I
ever want to do is make people happy and
so now for my future I have no idea
what's going to happen even if YouTube
or anything doesn't work out I have big
plans of getting farm filling it with
animals and then laying in the middle of
the farm were just being covered in
puppies and kitties and sheep all day
every day and I wish this video had a
happier and day
all I do know is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
