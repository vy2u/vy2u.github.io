bed I'm very excited about it my friends
this entire month I guess is kind of
just I'm doing whatever I want and I'm
having a really good time doing it
because you know what's important being
happy can't eat bug good thank you I
went down a hole recently on YouTube
which I do very often Presley like free
day and I came across this video of a
woman drawing a horse with both of her
feet which was mesmerizing and inspiring
and I just was like I would really like
to draw the feet I think that that would
be something that's fun and it could
make it a Jenna's drunk art school I
don't really feel like getting drunk
today you know what I mean it's kind of
the middle of the week but I think I
will have it a glass of wine for this
video because you know it's just a
festive thing to do when you're making
some art I'm sure you could do this as a
challenge or a tag I'm sure you could
play Pictionary with your friends I
tried to paint my toenails for you but
it just got all over my hands and then I
fucked it up but at least I tried you
can also always know what color someone
painted their toenails because it's all
over their hands here we go so I think
the first thing I'm gonna draw is gonna
be a horse because that woman drew a
horse and she really impressed me and
she with both her feet so let's just try
let's just balls out 100% right off the
bat so I don't have a brown marker or
like a horse colored marker but I do
have a green one and a pink one should
it be standing or sitting press one now
if it should be standing just kidding
here I can't see it

delicious blowing hair is back oh I did
that part good I'm good at backs what My

special riding him in case you couldn't
tell this is Shane Dawson on a horse

never looked better you look like an
angel

control your feet when they're this
excited about a horse nostrils say I
almost forgot his nostrils smile yeah
it's not quite like that ladies drawing
but you know what mine's pretty good
these are bushes maybe a right horse at
the bottom so then you know it is horse

hands and a hand accident because this
is rough I want to draw up marbles
permit and Peach mob will come here and
sit really still so I can see what your
face looks like shit maybe he's holding
a flower that's what he's doing
fuck his bottom half isn't looking so
right so we're gonna have to compensate
for his top half and make that look bang
in hot looks a little like a gremlin but
I mean so this marbles in real life

portrait okay this looks just lying to

just go all blown Tyler Oakley is the
pirate you're some gold cute and say
thank you it's like Tyler I hope you
don't mind that I gave you some chest
hair that's your mess is about you know
just not good at it man it can never be
that lady with her horse drawing I'm
just gonna draw a raft see I think my
problem is I'm just thinking too much
about it then just let it happen
you know alright let's draw him fighting
another giraffe after all that practice
we've gotten here which i think is a big
improvement at least I have some new
artwork painting the house I'm pretty
sure that this belongs in a museum this
is the portrait of PewDiePie and Marcia
it's just totally good yeah I know it's
elegant this is what I spent my time
doing it dying and I hope that you liked
it and I hope that it inspired you as
much as that horse lady inspired me to
just go out and you know make some
awesome drugs with your feet I also feel
like I've opened Pandora's box of things
that you can do with your feet which I'm
scared for make sure you subscribe to my
channel I put out new videos every
Wednesday / Thursday and say goodbye did
