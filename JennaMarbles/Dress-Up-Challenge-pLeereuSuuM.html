different video planned for today but
there was another shooting in the United
States this time in Southern California
which is very close to where we live
Julian's mom was actually driving
through the area when it was happening
it was hard for me to sit down make
jokes today because I was following the
news it it was just it was a sad day I
talked about this on my vlog channel if
you want to hear more of my thoughts on
that but it didn't feel quite right to
me to do anything other than something
very light-hearted and fun just for the
sake of keeping things as happy as we
can I think that's all that we can do
right now is to educate ourselves talk
with each other find you know common
ground amongst each other and work
together to create a better solution to
this problem as far as human beings and
going about our daily lives I think the
best thing that we could do right now is
you have some fun and to keep a light
and happy that's what I wanted to do
today
earlier this week we got to hang out
with our friends Trina and Jesse prank
vs. prank boyfriend vs. girlfriend oh we
did the condom challenge on their
Channel I'm gonna see that that was
really fun one of my favorite challenges
that they have done is to dress up
challenge although we do this often like
you're mock and I'm boy Jenna that's
true
so it's happened before it's not gonna
be that much of a shock though to see
you like in some girl clothes I think
it'll be a shock thank you but I wanted
to play an address of challenge for you
and for me this is like a dual-purpose
serving thing I need to keep it happy
and keep it light today we have each
selected three outfits for each other
