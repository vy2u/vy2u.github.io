time my family is actually coming here
to visit me and I don't know when

to set up my Christmas tree so I decided
what always makes the holidays merrier
fucking bat ball I was gonna decorate my
tree

what happens
and if this doesn't work out right then
at least I'll have made a really fun
home video for myself I'm not completely
alone my friend Courtney is here so
first thing I'm gonna do right now is
get hammered drunk who's excited we're
gonna go play chat random drinking game
which is you go to chat random and drink
every time you see a dick you will get
wasted be right back
what are you doing I'm gonna think that
the biggest one who's at the bottom ask
did you know it's really heavy like I
work out don't worry

what get more excited you're the top of
the tree you are the shit shit the L
nasty Donna jump off hey how you doing
where did your mom go to college because
I will get her pregnant shit shit it was
touching you hey okay
like that I don't you do fix like
bridges so it looks less like a roll of
toilet paper and more like a tree piece
Bullard Bowen hello in the spirit okay
this is too real that's the problem I've
added your plugged into each other
fucking oh my god fix the bridges at
least in the frontiers than your
family's like you're a fuckup X with P
downstairs and fill up the stairs
hard now that I finished the laborious
task of putting up this absolute piece
of shit that I want to take 15% credit
for because for me it was like oh my god
I'm gonna put this in here this in here
and I just stood by sort of like if it
doesn't line up it's so Christmas I'm
going to tell you some of the ornaments
that I've had since I was a child then
we can put them on the tree together

inconspicuous place on the tree because

blurry corny just broke a little mini
skunk off of my fake pawns diorama
ornament no it's okay I will just put it
o it on there it's on there it's on

pleasure tomorrow my pleasure
I mean just a complete embarrassment the
trick to decorating your tree is that
you just take some big-ass balls and
you're like Lance Armstrong I don't have
any hooks so this is floss
it's mint blocks at least we're gonna if
we're gonna blame him
breaking the Christmas tree at someone
it's your own look at your hair wash it
who shut up max no sleeves showed up
looking big bra like what was the last
time you did a shower for the record max
no sleeves and I did break up oh we're
still friends forever left we were
together for like four years you don't
just like break up but not scissor your
hands
you've been broken up for like two weeks
it's been really not fun I was really
sad really sad like Rosa there's a
Christmas tree
needs to be decorated bigger than us or
eat brought me this ornament no woman
wearing a bikini top your titty tattoos
what's this is a turtle from 1987 I like
turtles

it yeah it's more like oh that's fine
that's what also smells like in the top
center of the tree don't worry about a
really pretty hat
watch this decoration press 5 if you
want Kourtney to press 6 if you want to
dock press 7 if you know what docking is
this is a dog that's falling to its
death grasping for its life and it's
about to die hey please help me what a
horrible way to die
via candy Teddy who in the fuck gave
this to me tried to pass this off like
it's in orbit not oh you're welcome max
