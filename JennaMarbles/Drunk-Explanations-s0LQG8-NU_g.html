let it air-dry confused cuz I bleach it
so I'm gonna attempt to do something and
I have no idea what's going to turn out
this video is gonna be more of an
experiment every time I go out on the
weekends get drunk someone is always
trying to explain some strange topic to
me whatever they're saying it makes
perfect sense to them of course it does
because anytime that I've gotten drunk
and then tried to explain something
complicated to someone else I feel like
I'm doing the best job ever so I wanted
to see what would happen if I pick some
topics and I just asked on Twitter and
then got drunk and then try to explain
them to you just to see if I am also
guilty of being a horrible explainer
when I'm drunk I also want to drink and
record so that I can see what sort of
life-changing epiphanies I might come up
with and if this doesn't work out right
this videos just never gonna see a
late-day so I'm going to drink out of
this beautiful
Spider Man chalice how's it going and
I'm gonna come back and explain some
things I'll meet you back here although
when I edit this it's gonna be like
right now huh tell me this who at all
doesn't look like Selena Gomez I got
pretty drunk and I can tell because I
feel like I'm gonna crush this video and
have drunk neck what does people like
you guys get like drunk crashes okay
Twitter suggestion why is there a Dark
Side of the Moon I got this so the Sun
is over here and then the moon's here
and then my face is like the earth hey
fucking this one goes around this one
and this one shines over to this one
but then this doesn't really like do a
whole lot this egg's dark because no one
cares about
okay that's why it stays in the dark
because fucking no one gives a shit
next question periodic table you ready
periodic table is full of awesome ass
shit get out of here unicorn you got
your fucking the metals your
transitional metals your gases your
noble gases I mean those are the most
noble of all the elements except at the
bottom you have the all the man-made
elements that aren't even fucking real
like congratulations bro like you
fucking invented something then no one
gives a shit about fuck you I'm sure
it's important we need you scientists
but to the periodic tables table is like
all the things that are the most pure
things seen a chart that you can look at
I'm sure of the periodic table the
elements and the radioactive ones
glow-in-the-dark okay no Philip can you
explain how underwater tunnels are made
fucking what first of all that to have
some sort of underwater vessel to begin
with or else they wouldn't be able to
get under the water then they'd have to
have something that's a tool start
building something under the water
how does this work they're all wearing
scuba suits this is a question for
another time can you explain what happen
to Amanda Bynes for us oh yeah nothing
happened to amanda Bynes
she's just being fucking electric can't
you just let her be electric she's just
over their crushing life like she gives
a fuck multiple people asked me to
describe the taste of water
how about wet does wet suffice he's like
how things freeze so when the
temperature drops all particles start
moving really slow and then it's like
the 1990s ish version of Batman where
Arnold Schwarzenegger is the fucking
Iceman he's like look killed the
dinosaurs and they're all like
we're scared you have an ice gun and
he's like the Ice Age oh then you shoots
all of them and everybody fucking
freezes it's like that except less ice
and Arnold Schwarzenegger and more like
particles you just get really slow in
our fucking like we're lucky all right
next question
the rules of cricket it's like baseball
if somebody like we wrote it in a
language that you didn't understand this
person's Instagram looks exciting and
then you click on it and all their
captions are in a language that you
can't understand and you're like it
seems so familiar I can't like get it
because your fucking language is so
different ah cultural differences that's
the rules of cricket yes but I get you
but I don't get you tell the entire plot
summary of a movie you've never seen all
right here's a good one I've never
actually watched the movie Harry no Mary
Bob all I've ever seen Mary Poppins is
that there's fucking penguins is
umbrellas there's cartoons here we go
Greta Mary Poppins is the nanny or some
shit she's around all the people's
children but she's like cool because
she's like here fucking take this drug
with some sugar and then you'll get
fucking fucked up and then I will have
to deal with you and when you take this
shit spoonful of sugar make sure like
liquid heroin go down and then I get to
do my grown-up Mary popping things like
fuck that dude in the suit that spins
around on a lamp post and then I take
drugs myself also because there's
nothing but cartoon penguins and shit
running around I have on a dress when
it's sunny out but it's got like sleaze
on it way too hot you know it is you
fucking know it is and on my high horse
the entire movie until everyone what to
do hey look at me I'm Mary Poppins like
everyone loves me a fucking trip acid or
whatever because they keep being around
one's in the cartoons and then all the
parents come home is that how that movie
ends up ah Mary Poppins gave your kids
drugs and then I took drugs and I Fox
him dude while you guys were gone and
then pay meetings at the movie hurry my
way up from an outside perspective I
have a strong feeling that I'm so right
I'm gonna have to google it tomorrow
explain cheese cheese is that time that
your milk went really bad and someone's
like I wonder what happens if you just
leave it here forever
for the most part nothing happens to
anything but for that one lazy person
that left like their milk or whatever in
some sort of damp cellar place whoever
the fuck they make like those aged
cheese's everything seemed to work out
and then not only did he leave it in
there for long enough for it to turn
into a completely different substance
entirely he fucking ate it and was like
hey friends this is actually tasty wanna
see who dies first and then they started
doing other milk and then like putting
things in it is that unlike geez die
mature I know it's like old dairy right
look really old dairy I guess it worked
out for somebody so she received for
saving your leftovers like a boss friend
and I were coming up with a marketing
campaign idea for deodorant
all right the the campaign is stop being
so sweaty and smelly motherfucker rub
this shit on your armpits bitch and haha
stinky you stink so stop it you got
deodorant on your shirt but at least you
care calm hashtag you smell nice so one
can you even come close to that how
electricity works electricity works like
was your thing and goes to your light
bulb that lights up
not complicated zombie apocalypse plans
best zombie defense for your house is
not a fucking crossbow it's not a
fucking gun or whatever the fuck you get
a bunch of treadmills you surround your
house with them so then when the zombies
tried to get to your house
they just keep fucking slipping and
falling like as long as they can turn
them off or step on the sides of them
but like in theory it's a really good
idea and you know it it will at least
stall them long enough so that you can
shoot them your crossbow while they're
following on the treadmills it's great I
mean keep that everyone explain turtles
turtles are just lizards or salamanders
or some sort of reptile or amphibian
fish thing it got tired of like getting
a sunburn and like looking for shelter
so it was like I think I'm just gonna
grow one fuck you it's a big human
really like like having permanent
shelter so you know what I'm gonna do is
I'm just gonna adapt and evolve and grow
and fucking just have it on top of me so
that I don't have to worry about renting
and having a landlord or roommates and
then she's there for me it's genius
that's why they're mad old like we have
brains cool but do you have a house on
your body no all right I don't know that
in my mind I'm being fucking dead honest
