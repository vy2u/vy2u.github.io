ever since I did my drunk makeup
tutorial one of the most requested
videos has been a drunk hair tutorial
and I was trying to think of a way to do
it because I don't know just seems
dangerous like hot tools and stuff then
I was like I don't poke my eye out give
me my drop makeup tutorial so I mean
fucking Yolo they'll use that right yes
so for those of you that didn't see my
drunk makeup tutorial the idea was when
you go day-drinking
it's really hard to like do your makeup
when you're hammered so I guess I never
addressed this in that video that it's
emily is hard to do your hair when
you're hammered so I decided that I want
to attempt the most incredibly ambitious
hairdo I can think of which is like a
formal prom or like Bridal updo which is
why I've done my makeup like full-out so
that I can get the whole look when I'm
done step one I guess is going to be to
get drunk well what's in it I will tell
you that's fun like right Mac alright so
I'll be back in a little bit yeah future
here when I edit it - like right yeah
whose idea was this mine this my idea
Tom it wasn't my idea was your idea I
literally drank my eyelashes off I did
the Project Runway drinking game which
was drink every time someone's like I
don't know what I'm thinking
Oh freaka oh look oh you like drink at
me three seconds let's get this shit
going first of all I don't know I'm
doing like legitimately hammered you
fucking eat curly hair you do shit and
we can go up right we're gonna do that
have this thing shut up
this is a curling iron with no metal
thing and then you have the hey Michael
Jackson glove
we got to curl our hair first then do
all the teasing and uploading you have
to section off her hair take your hands
and you say I'm Moses this is the red
seat you're going this and you're going
that way and then the Jews crosses the
middle except instead of Jews as your
curling iron I'm not being offensive I'm
just making a historical reference I
think that that red light means attack
then you feel out some shit and you want
to go away from your face this way oh
it's still hot though oh my god doesn't
work at all maybe I'm not going to the
hospital I'm not getting like degree
burns there's some really fucking hot we
wait doesn't even on it here's the
tricky ready huh way from my face oh yes
that's not much of a trick if it doesn't
work great
your next step is to take your clip out
you got to get the middle part of your
hair husband yeah and then you clip your
hair
thank you if your hair was cleaner than
mine
you didn't just lift heavy things 24/7
how much do you bench chin all of it oh
my god dignity curling your hair is the
ultimate metaphor for individuality it
burns it hurts it doesn't feel right
don't think you're doing your repertoire
oh how do I like your Aristotle you
ain't got shit on me take out the top
tier up there this is the Occupy
movement this is the 1% the part that
thinks it's the most important they're
like The Real Housewives of your head

hurt I'll do I hair your next step is
teasing your hair so it's a big on your
head so your goal is to make yourself an
alien head except your skull is shaped
like a human that's why you want to make
it bigger you are hair to be bigger
