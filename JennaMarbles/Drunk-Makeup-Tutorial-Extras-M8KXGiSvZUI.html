may find this a little bit hard to
believe but I am actually a human being
and I go through ups and downs and life
things just like everybody else and this
week I am just really sad and I can't
really bring myself to make a funny
video even if I forced it but I did want
to give you something I don't want to
just leave you with nothing so I decided
to in an attempt to make myself laugh
edit some of the drunk makeup tutorial
extras and I'm thinking the couple weeks
where there's holidays Christmas and New
Year's that might put a couple more
extras videos up because I have so much
extra footage and I want to be with my
family and stuff like that so just a
heads up but this week is just I can't
and I'm really really really really
really sorry if I disappointed any of
you and people asked always ask did I
really get drunk and I actually did I
think you'll see how drunk I got I
actually got so drunk that I didn't
remember when I woke up the next day if
I had even finished the video so
hopefully you can still laugh and have
sexual Wednesday but I got it I gotta
just take care of myself for a little
bit but I love all of you and Kermit and
marbles send their hugs and kisses and
loves and hug love slugs legs we love
you okay hm
arty what I'm alone cuz your skin's like
uh-huh like pee-wee Herman pee-wee
Herman's neck goes through and he drinks
ah ha ha
kick your hair aw do you face get your
hair out of your face
flex your muscles do yourself Red Bull
vodkas I do the time for me to get drunk
was like
in 15-20 1/2 and I don't know what's
going on wasn't that long because
doesn't take a lot really a truck kind
of a lightweight kind of pussy my skin's
all like not having it we don't like it
my eyes are like no no no extreme
closeup there's no way I'm putting this
in a video yes I I think I got too drunk
shiver it's cold
make sure that your skin is ready for
your makeup by flapping it slap it just
get ready Billy you don't have to wash
your face just go like this get quick up
ready are you ready are you ready you
ready you ready you ready you ready
right ok already also make sure nothing
is on fire don't light any candles
because first they're all like hey we're
friends cuz we're candles and then they
burn your house down
and then some man with tattoos is
carrying you fireman carrying it over a
shoulder on your house fire safety I'm
ready to go sleep get yourself a cup of
coffee or something
fight it fight it with all of your might
it
I'm so creepy I can't stop last time
that you went to the kitchen you just
forgot what you were there for so now
you have to go back I don't feel good I
got cold again this is a unicorn blood
in she'd vagina make sure you do it
really fast because the faster you do it
like this the better it comes out then
blend that can't stand up straight
that's how you know you're doing it
right okay
so good way to clean up your
day-drinking face i shadow they're gonna
lift this in your hands right oh man I
don't know what I did starting out to be
a sad video you already defined your
eyelids with some liquid shit so just go
over that just make it all kinds of
sexual already friendship watch this I
don't even need a mirror close your eyes
feel that shit out um no matter what
you're doing if you if you have contact
lenses it this is just not gonna be that
fun for you so you can't win so you
might have messed up in a few places
don't worry about it like this you what
look at all uh all that the the alcohol
the alcohol in your mouth is just gonna
kill it look it hey you know science
because if you have lashes on can you
look like hey you fucking really tried
dude you know maybe you were just crying
a little bit you've got stuff all over
your face and maybe just had a bad night
look at those lashes stay here look I
can just get it all over there it's
Clark
get it up if you get it up don't you
just get just anuman doing them to let
this dry cuz you know what you got shit
to do you got you have to go back out
like a couple hours do you got people to
meet in fucking stuff to do
you got to pick out your outfit in your
hair get just get them on there just get
them on just make them look as good as
possible you got to get your eyebrows on
because if there's one thing in the
world that I hate it's when girls are
wearing fake eyelashes you you literally
glued something on your face and you
can't pencil in your eyebrows
drunky you got it you got a fish fry
bros ready don't look uncle no eyes no
clothes no clothes get your eyebrows on
that the trick to this is closing your
eyes because you're slightly tired don't
do it don't do it like shorten up do it
just like over and out like news
broadcasts over and out
is that right whatever
just look up think about puppies and
kittens and fucking hamsters think about
baby jury just ah doesn't feel good hey
that was not what we planned for but it
is what it is you know it is what it is
hey remember that time you found a straw
he needs it but hey on Islands stuck to
my eye alright so now you got to finish
your face do it like you're going out
you have to make sure like you get you
get your fee salt on so the people are
like oh she like tried really hard hey
it's hard it's Angoor don't hit yourself
in the face without the hurt hurts your
nails cut them the biggest technique
here is to make sure that it goes onto
the side of your face and like are on
your face make a circle with your face
there make yourself a bronze mustache
games just make it break right if
there's one thing that dudes love it's a
girl that's all fucking excited and face
Hey look it you see how excited I am
look how excited am your choices up look
on our coochie ho trick ho shit fucking
streetwalker fucking I'm gonna suck your
dick for money I will I will punch you
in the face for $50 just make sure it's
along those lines okay just that fucking
ho shit get that whole shit put it on
your lips then you get the girl that's
fucking it that's a dude fucking go hot
you look
click some fucking with the fire on your
face right now
Hey you see how high up that eyelashes
look at that the glue is still drying
that's epic that's how you know what's
gonna stay all night mm-hmm
so no this this isn't this isn't fucking
easy and yeah might take a little
practice but someday you know you'll get
it right
someday you'll get it right right now
you're just doing the best you can
this is this is a pretty good luck they
ask me lol world lol life Oh
then just stand around judge yourself to
make sure you put some data right now on
or some shit I can make sure you change
your shirt maybe make out with some
weird-ass dudes your dogs are sleeping
because it's night time and victory you
know if you don't know what my dogs look
like you can just click on all that
other shit and then imagine what they
say at the end of every other video and
