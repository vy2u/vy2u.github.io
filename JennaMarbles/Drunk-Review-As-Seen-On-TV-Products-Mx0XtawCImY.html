November since I've made any sort of
drunk video and I know on my Facebook
people have been requesting drunk sex ed

figure it out it's just kind of got bad
juju written a Humphrey but someone
suggested that I make a drunk
infomercial so I was like you know who I
love on YouTube is fucking bunny
graveyard girl she does all of these as
seen on TV reviews a lot of them are
really shitty like a lot of them I
genuinely going to the store and want to
try and although bunny has done like all
of these basically like actual reviews I
really just wanted to fucking get drunk
and try some fucking as seen on tv shit
so I got what I could find this isn't
really like a Jenner's drunk art school
or a tutorial it's kind of like a drug
review which I've never done which I'm
excited about
I like eating things I've never done
before so I'm gonna get drunk and I'm
gonna fucking play with some as seen on
tv shit it's fucking shadow to you buddy

thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put on a
festive outfit I would like a three-way
hug show that is many versatile styles
and looks okay close your eyes let's

so the next product I want to review is
the pedegg my feet are little gross only
because I'm been wearing these black
flip-flops I'm like cheese creating my
feet terrifying I don't like this this
could get really dangerous really fast I
give the pedegg original a 0 out of
fuckin negative 50 because what the fuck
I was desperately searching for the
pedegg power thing that you can get but
the best I can do is micro petty ah
power sanding my toes okay
it just ate my toes and this would be
right at all you can literally see these
dust particles flying off which means
that this is a great thing stuck on my
linking
it's okay except that ruin my pedicure

a fuck off out of fucking to juggle
bubbles

orange colored winter gloves I have
these ate some shit fill out and wear
your bubbles Annie's shit
alright take your shit and then like
blow shit touch it with your hands and
finger it and blow it all around got it
okay alright wrap things up can I get
some help as to how I juggled the
bubbles oh you have to wiggle Oh after
you blow the bubbles you have to jerk
them off into your hand what's in it for
me though
what juggle bubbles zero all I do right
now is play with my squishy sand which
is probably one of the only positive
things that I bought but on the rest of
this shit terrifying a shitty useless
