why are you going hey nice having
conversation the other day
like how many lunges you think you've
done in your life how many glasses of
milk do you think you drink only
hamsters have you fisted and I kind of
got me thinking about all the other dumb
things that I spend my time doing like
regular everyday stuff how much time in
my life
26 years old I spent doing these things
some of them are girl things some of
them are gender-neutral but I add some
of them up and I wanted to share them
with you because they're interesting for
example Kermit how many hours have you
spent shooting on my carpet Amelie
shoulder puppy let's start with makeup
shall we so I don't say I started doing
makeup when I was like 15 years old so
it's like 11 years fucking let's say
average all that up about an hour each
time to do a makeup five days a week
five hours a week that's a hundred and
nineteen full fucking days I've spent
putting ho face on my whole face and
that amount of time I could have gone to
a department store try it on all the
underwear out the sticky things on it
gone to rest had gone to jail come back
home by now your nails say you did your
nails two times a month and it took you
an hour both time so two hours a month
say you started doing that when you're
13 years old
that's 13 days of just painting shit on
your nails in 13 days i cooked on a 12
day app challenge drank a coke and
mentos and then just exploded
brushing your teeth so you're supposed
to brush your teeth for two minutes
twice a day is fourteen hundred and
sixty minutes a year of just fucking
straight-up tooth brushing and
toothpaste Ain and getting all over your
clothes or 24 entire case that amount of
time I could have crab walked an entire
marathon and finished first because no
one else will be doing it getting
dressed so sometimes it takes like an
hour on the weekend sometimes things
like twenty second Franks are fucking
late for shit cuz you're me I'm average
that out to be like twenty minutes a day
you spend finding your socks and fucking
putting them on your body 3163 hours or
131 days straight
I've spent dressing myself like putting
a bra on and underwear
it in that time I could add in a new
flavor of ice cream every day for 31
days and then hibernating 400 just lived
underground like fuck you guys see the
spring feeding your gluttonous face
whole breakfast and lunch you're usually
kind of short but then dinner maybe is
longer I'd say around 2 hours a day
unless you fucking Sarang eat 4 hours 2
hours a day you spend actually like
eating time to 365 times my age I've
spent seven hundred and ninety days
doing nothing but feeding my fucking
face whole like over two years I've
spent feeding myself I have an
associate's degree in fucking eating
playing apps apps have been around for
like five years so I've spent like five
years playing apps how much time I've
spent watching reality TV or like the
notebook now the average is much higher
cuz I googled it what I do you say maybe
the average person watches like two
hours of TV a night is like thirty days
a year watching other people on a screen
make assholes of themselves started
watching TV and I know when you're like
three yeah when can you start seeing
shit that's like not right for your face
Sesame Street so that's about 700 days
that I've spent fucking watching TV 700
days I could have crossed the country in
a wheelchair square wheels train wheels
and like a bus at hand and like no face
and back and that crying for some reason
I wanted to calculate uh how much time I
thought I might have cried in my entire
lifetime fear girl we get sad about
stuff averaging in from when your baby
and you cry like fuckin harder times a
day like an asshole
so here's how I calculated crying take
your age multiply it by your age and
then add your age and that's how many
hours you spent crying so I spent seven
hundred two hours crying in my life and
then subtract your age and that's how
many hours you've spent in addition
trying not to cry like 29 days cry
probably higher than that internet
stalking older people take the number of
boyfriends or girlfriends you've ever
had or if you've never had one how many
people you wish where your boyfriend or
girlfriend at some point then
automatically multiply that number by 5
because that's how many people involved
in their life that you also need to
doc like do some catfish research on in
order to get to know the person that
you're stocking then multiply that by
the number of hours that you spent
crying plus the number of homework
assignments that you've blown off in
your life plus your Facebook password
times cookies minus twenty four thousand
five hundred eighty three hours I've
spent stocking people on the internet
about two point eight years of stocking
and that amount of time you could have
gotten a cat atom room and all of your
furniture key all of your house and then
sold it at a garage sale for negative
twenty dollars you take the toy
liability your cat gave it to someone
how much time you spend talking behind
girls backs
well first you start with the amount of
girls that you know then on top of that
you add the number of people that you
ever met your entire life and divide by
one because everyone talks behind your
back looking duh time you spent waiting
for your boy to text you back okay so
you add the digits of your phone number
together multiply that by the number of
bars of service you have right now on
your phone times the number of contacts
you have in your phone plus why mine is
eleven thousand eight hundred hours
we're about four hundred ninety one days
silver a year I've spent waiting for
boys to text me back and sleeping eight
hours in a or eight point six years I've
spent sleeping that time I could have
become a vagina doctor or at least a
really convincing coat and then found my
way to Rihanna and so all that together
is about eighteen point six years I've
spent doing shit I don't even want to do
it but for some reason feel like I have
to I'm actually really seven and a half
years old I guess we consider actual
life living time that guide explains a
lot of questions about my level of
maturity get away from me I'm gonna go
grab my big wheel so yeah I guess what I
realized is that I spent a lot of my
life doing a whole lot of nothing you
should tweet at me some fucking
calculations that you come up with maybe
you calculate the time that you spend
jerking off and then send me a picture
of your forearm so make sure you
subscribe to our channel Perez every
Wednesday who are you you can still get
them and if you don't get them then we
can't be friends okay what are this
Sigma net from you can't
yeah the thinking out the dinner first
fuck you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
