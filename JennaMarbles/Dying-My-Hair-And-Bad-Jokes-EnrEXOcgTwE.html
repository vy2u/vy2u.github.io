directions and things it says don't get
it in your eyes because it will cause
blindness do you hate Julian for no
reason other than joining some really
nice guy and I even opened the door for
myself since the day that I met him but
he's gonna help me in the back of my
hair and tell you some really bad jokes

big Jimmy say to the low Jimmy what
you're too young to be smoking I watched
like seven YouTube tutorials I'm
basically a professional right any
friend of mine have been appalled that
the things I've done to my own hair like

latex gloves so you're supposed to like
me to change your gloves every once in a
while

call Toby and tell him that some girl
took my fall and that she might be
blowing up his phone I'm really bad at
this
so some girl just took my phone and when
she handed it back to me
it was in my contact list and she handed
it back to me with your phone number so
