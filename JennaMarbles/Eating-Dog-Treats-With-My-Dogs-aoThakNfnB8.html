on Facebook what you wanted to see and
as you know sometimes I actually do make
the things that you wanna see and not
just what Jenna wants to make selfish
selfish and someone suggested that I eat
dog treats or dog food with my dogs this
month is the dog's birthday month marble
says June 5th peach was June 15th and
Kermit is on June 28th so I want to do
something fun special because it's your
birthday huh I went to a pet store I got
a bunch of food that's human greed and
I'm gonna eat it with them and see what
we like right thank you for the person
that suggested this because this is
gonna get gross and fucking weird I
thank you I mean fuck you we're gonna
break the truth out scale of 1 to 10 I'm
gonna rate them and then each dog will
rate that because marbles is very picky
and he only likes certain things ok here
we go guys this I was feeling this is
gonna take a long time to shoot this
video we're gonna start with some fruta
bowls which are like banana pumpkin
flavored you guys want your own marble
I'm gonna bite mine in half for you girl
bye hmm go go who dropped their peach
rates it a negative 4 because she threw
it off of the chair I'm it's gonna go
ahead and rate it at 3 I think I think
he likes that
Oh marbles is gonna rate it a barrier
because he looks like he's about to bury
his I'm gonna rate it like a 4 tastes
like banana cardboard guys what the fuck
it has a very bizarre aftertaste you
guys tasting that you taste another tube
oh let's move on to pop tato chips oh
shit I just opened it like a whiff of
shit
potato chips guys yeah mmm oh that's
gross it tastes like like a dried up
lipstick marbles is rating this up area
also 0 from marbles 3 from Kermit and 1
from peach don't want eat their potato
chips not for people okay
this is bacon flavor with real yogurt
mmm nothing says treat quite like bacon
and yogurt peachy come get you
yeah it's food it looks like a
Mentos oh my god I like melt I'm him
aside from the pungent disgusting yogurt
flavor in the beginning the bacon is
pretty good it's like an after-dinner
mint right guys
oh mama likes oh that's like a five from
marvel bags all around right yeah they
weren't like crazy excited for it but
like Marvel in it which means it's
decent I'm gonna give it five that's
pretty good I feel like there's some
grown adults that would eat that I don't
know what the fuck this is but it says
grass-fed Moo I don't like the way it
sounds
it looks like some sort of jerky okay
everyone get your bravery on oh no no no
I really don't like fifty is like beef
that's like wrapped in seaweed and then
like laid out to dry and like a really
hot Sun oh I'm like that what do you

gave it a five I even egative two ships
fucking great so the guys said that
these were like chocolate mint biscuits
there's some for you eat it oh no not so
hot huh guys what always very fun I

gonna give it a zero two I'm gonna
how about some Malibu dog kitchen vegan
peanut power I don't know what about
this says peanut power
these look like nasty doodoo sticks here
you go guys
I don't know if you can hear that I've
tastes like almost nothing I don't know
how they can get away with saying peanut
power when it doesn't even taste like
peanuts my why would you give this a
zero is that this so 2 2 and 0
mine gets a zero definitely because the
title is misleading it tastes nothing
like peanuts it only tastes like shit
let's move on now oh this is how you
know that they like it when they're
already getting excited
sit so this is some chicken cutlets made
with brushed on benefits this one is the
energy style
it's like slimy Oh Kermit Oh Kermit
skinning it at 10 Kermit is giving it a
10 mmm it has all of the texture of a
jerky and all of the flavor of like a
poopy diaper mm-hmm uh-uh there's no
salt or flavor so it just tastes like
fish
it tastes like nasty dry fish that's
hands on run except for you yeah I'll
give it a negative 30 to balance out
just how nasty it
oh you breath is so bad perfect let's
try this delicious pupcake
I think this is for dogs bigger than you
but would you like to try and lick the
frosting no I just want a burp on it
that's how it's gonna be so tasty
it's sweetie peach you know like your
sweet it was look if you open the
package of oatmeal and then just pour it
in your mouth that's what it tastes okay
