tell you what happened today I tried to
do a Taylor Swift video and it turned
out far Walt's a surprise to squint is
that right nice black I'm so upset
because I was really excited about it it
sucked so much and I actually cried
earlier today I cried like I had to fix
my makeup and my eyelashes time for
lunch
I'm so sorry I really tried so hard I
know you probably hate me right now
don't worry join the club because I hate
myself so much because this video sucks
fuck this video this was bound to happen
cuz I shoot edit and upload all in the
same day I did a video it fucking sucked
and I need some serious cheering up
right now those don't look like Taylor
Swift I'm actually married two weeks
right now
I like spray painted I'm a little bit
because they were the wrong color
it's okay the more on the story is
sometimes you fail miserably and then
you need to cheer yourself up afterwards
next is the Flex car sometimes when your
life gets really weird you just have to
dress up like a kangaroo or a fly spell
and then you feel better
I still feel better thank you flying
squirrel so Smosh does this on their
second channel they speed draw people
and there's always comes out so
hilarious and fun so I was like why
don't I do that so that I can laugh and
be happy and I slosh we got scented
markers and these great yeah let's drop
mr. marbles see black oh there's your
one go
hey you show yours - or models is
wearing a sports coat obviously and a
bowtie and is shooting a gun and
drinking some some brandy that's pretty
good because I accidentally sort of drew
Michaels as a cat I don't know how it
got like that okay time to fail
miserably today mr. marbles real cool hi
let's draw Kermit got it go hang up this
is Kermit at the Olympics winning a
sprint
you're fucking crushing me right now I
do
Kermit and I also Drew's balls but then
I cross them out because it's fixed look
so happy it doesn't look great
so yeah I got the giant butt power shit
we are drawing Michael Jackson in five
four three two one go my mother go
Jackson came on like a pig
this is what happened I drew this one
this is the first thing I drew and I was
like oh that's a nose throw it out and
then I had to restart and he's saying he
can do it a little I do something that's
questionable point - Jenna you're gonna
draw one direction
Ready Set wait go
- sighs this is my one direction one
direction that way this is the kid with
the hair
these two are whoever that's the blonde
one
I didn't have a yellow marker and that's
the one big does it look like the others
my one direction came out remarkably
like a set of Power Rangers because I
drew the microphones first erroneous say
don't stand like the Jackson 5 max they
walk around get the ladies go this guy's
kickin that's why I got to be I know
like oh shit they gonna do something
different with you you don't know and I
was gonna write more but let's draw a
giraffe
ready dope so my giraffe I definitely
just snout a little long I thought he
was a velociraptor and then I thought it
was a Tyrannosaurus Rex and then I
thought it was a drought that he was
gonna be taking this shit and then I
thought maybe he should just be eating
some fruit for his tail
did Brian know just gonna go giraffe
anyways here's my giraffe it says hey
girl
max sucks and he's sort of her delicate
turtle better than yours loose that
clothes off my lines my drafts got a
bowtie so fuck your dress my dress pink
come here often
let's play a game where we both squirt
woo cream our mouth and try make each
other laugh and whoever laughs first
loses
yeah little cream never hurt anybody
well I would say subscribe to my channel
but I'm too sad so I need to go eat some
macaroni cheese or something you should
tweet me a picture of your dog or cat
and then I'll feel better I guess I'll
see you next week I'm gonna go cry for a
week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
