not been an easy week for Julian and I
he's not hearing now but when I'm having
a really hard time I'd say one of my
favorite outlets is to just love my
animals feel like I just need to take my
love out on my son add as you can see
behind me this is his cage was set up
it's a little bit overdue for her
cleaning I not only wanted to clean his
cage I wanted to just give it a little
love a little makeover I know a lot of
you have been wanting me to make one of
those massive popsicle stick houses like
on vanilla ham ham I think that would
take me like a month I'm interested in
doing it I just haven't sat down and
done it yet so this isn't gonna be a
popsicle stick house I would still like
to do that in the future but I want to
do like all the cool stuff that you see
on YouTube like a nice backdrop for
maybe change the theme around a little
bit if you're not here for this stuff I
totally understand and I'll see you next
week so forgive me if it's not the most
fun and amazing video in the whole world
I know some of you are interested
because you love hamsters as much as I
do usually we'd never wake our hamster
up and I can't shoot this at 4:00 in the
morning when he's awake so I will
eventually have to wake him up the fun
thing about hamsters is if you just
change around their cage a little bit
they're like is this like blows their
mind it's very exciting so step one and
cleaning adds cage is give your dogs
the dog toys you got for them of the pet
star because you can't help yourself but
you also don't want them to get jealous
sorry this is gonna be very weird the
whole time pretty much basically the
first thing I do is I take out all the
big stuff and if any stuff needs to get
washed I'll take it to the sink and wash
it might take his tunnel out that's
where I'd is so I'm gonna feel bad
someday you know something's going on
what stuck on you but you got stuffing
all over you hi father I'm gonna take
you out in a second
you can stay in there for now I don't
even want to see what's in your tunnel
cuz you hoard all your little belongings
in there it's okay I'm gonna save some
of your bedding for your next house okay
there's my man will clean your cage what
do we need to buy because it's stressful
huh oh my god food in here I'm gonna get
like a pan so I can scoop this all right
look out he's trying to dig himself a
new little nest he wants to go back to
bed I think I'm gonna take little baby
ad out and put him in his other cage
like his old cage me bud I know I'm
sorry honey I know it's really stressful
huh I'll be right back
I was the dog's back out cause karma was
screaming try to do this as fast as I
can so you can get back in here at least
oh my but there's a big village so he's
asking like a lot Aspen and then I put
all the like soft carefresh just come
out you're trying to make a rainforest
around you
Wow that's fun so I got a bunch of stuff
and I'm trying to figure out what my
plan is cuz I will have wood yet so that
stuff that was in the right hand side
before is actually soft granule bedding
which ad really likes it looks like this
so part of the reason why I'm doing this
makeover is because when the dogs see ad
they get very excited so part of the
plan is to put on like a curtain type
thing for the front so then when he
wakes up and we're not gonna like take
them out right away we can put the
curtain on there so the dogs stop
barking hey baby munchkin so usually one
of the first things I do is figure out
where little beanbags
tunnels gonna go this is one of those
favorite things and the whole world sort
of up and down almost like this way like
around that way but I'm sorry vineet but
I'm gonna fill in this stuff and see if
I can get it to stay like that I'm by no
means a hamster expert but I learned a
lot from people on YouTube coconut fiber
and that stuff I learned from a channel
called hopping cami who literally did
like a rainforest design it was so cute
he's like burying himself he's so
excited I know yeah I've been waiting
for my house so I was thinking of
something like this where these can
stick out but we can still put some
stuff in the corner okay but he really
likes the soft granule to dig in it's
really fun
oh yeah and me we'll see if you choose
to make the tunnel your nest again
because sometimes you like to nest in
your Tong
sometime you like your house we're gonna
do some brown first does I have the most
of it
oh yeah that's the soft stuff um babe
yes what has brought you out was it soft
Thanks
so I actually got add a new water bottle
at someone's suggestion because he did
have a plastic one before I got him a
glass water bottle but I do need to get
a new piece of velcro so I can stick it
on the side there there it is that's new
shiny new glass no now I'm gonna add
some more rainforest colors and to add
to each so you can really just be
transported this is like it looks like a
thing that you put water or food in like
very snake or reptile but I'm gonna fill
it with some stuff for him to roll
around it I got him a new vlog and also
this you have water out of you thirsty
are you thirsty huh prefer soft drinks
I'm aware that this is like so super
overcast but if you think this is extra
let's go look at the other channels on
YouTube I promise you this is really not
that bad Oh cam oh this looks very
rainforest II may be thick enough free
to dig you gotta put your wheel in here
so I can sit flat on this cup I forgot
about that
fuck that's what my guy is waiting for
okay be careful I'm still putting it in
here is you be careful just wait a
second I'm very excited was that oh
there he goes
like running a rain forest or what well
I've been like five minutes and you're
covered in stuff ten out of ten excited
so there's his beach and tunnel which he
is thoroughly hidden to me and then the
rest it's not very rainforest sea but
you know what which range so I'm gonna
put some coconut substrate in there he's
gonna back his extra sand bath that he
really likes and then that little rock I
sort of like buried in here so
does have like a pop entrance and made
him like a little hideaway cuz he loves
to sneak up against the wall and like
get in there and then I love on my stay
in the living room and you can see him
hang out in there and like do little add
stuff and a log and then I did leave his
house and that's just a bird ladder but
oh somebody likes that spot you know
what it's not about you she's having so
much fun already it's like so rewarding
you just like you to barely do anything
and he's like having the best fucking
time just a little bit of his old
bedding put some out so he can have it
and sort of choose her to make his nest
smells like him be having such a good
time
oh god he's so cute why I love him so
much in this cabinet we got some food
treats and then this is the sand that I
like to use it's called tiny friends
farm this boy loves his sand coconut
substrate obviously you wouldn't like
fill your hamster cage abyss or anything
I have read this looks like a fun loose
texture it's like fun for them to have a
little you know
smells like reptile oh it's so soft
oh that's fun texture comfortable very
stressful when you get a new house oh I
don't think that's where the door is
hi he's doing a get ad I told you I got
a surprise for you so I put this that's
also like a reptile log it's basically a
road to nowhere but don't tell him that
oh yeah thats a coconut substrate you
like that I think I like sand better
what it loves and sand bath huh like so
happy oh it's very excited get it all in
there bud make sure you take it into bed
with you this is so wonderful oh there
he goes all right let's get going on the
outside
I bought this I couldn't find any
wrapping paper with anything other than
just like pink and glitter
I found this wood looking it's like it
says bulletin board paper so what I'm
gonna do is try and cut it and then just
tape it to the back the outside so that
it looks like wood in there we literally
built this like entertainment center
they sell them at pet stores there
specifically for like fish tanks like
this is a fish tank it was a Saturday
was like so nice out we're just inside
stressed over this piece of furniture
that we're building for our hamster I
hope I can do this without moving the
whole thing because I don't think that I
can do it without knocking the whole
thing over so I'm just gonna like yes
roll we gotta get this without it
looking like ass this takes a while you
know like this whole thing there's just
like Sophie repeated there's such a big
payoff like you see them be like visibly
excited it's just I love doing this oh
my god it's working I feel like I've
found my calling and it's putting
wrapping paper behind an aquarium
because I just nailed that first try it
looks like real good no one can even
tell are you fucking kidding me that's
worth like two seconds I didn't even
move the cage it's like so close to the
wall and they nailed it I'm good at
stuff my idea for the curtain I
literally bought these like dolls these
wooden dowels and I was like trying to
think of a way to fasten them on here
like some tiny shower curtain I was like
that is ridiculous
you know we should do Jenna with your
brain is just by a piece of beautiful
look at this it's like black and white
galaxy fabric and I'm just gonna stick a
big piece of velcro on here so we can
like rip it on and rip it off I think
it's gonna look classy and lovely and
beautiful this is a way
yeah a tiny hamster shower-curtain I
don't know what I was thinking oh that
is straight
every two seconds I'm gonna have to cut
off this ugly edge cuz it ugly I don't
want to measure it I just wanna cut yeah
that's the grab and pray method really
efficient so I did stick on the velcro
but then I realized like I'm dumb this
is gonna come off this is like a spandex
fabric so I just ran it through my
selling machine one time to keep it to
get there from we pull it on and off cuz
I'm an idiot look at that oh it's
beautiful
I haven't really looked to much but I
have never seen someone make a curtain
dress their cancer page this is a real
DIY hamster curtain you know what I'm
saying
I can't be the only person has a hamster
and dogs that like get excited by the
hamster so if you're one of those people
I've just created this solution for you
I just have one thing left for my son
this man needs just a little bit like 6
batteries no this far so let's just put
it on there this is a home makeover and
add 2/3 with it Wow alright I'm gonna
take off the tripod so you can cage tour
it so this is what it looks like with
the curtain huh can't see it what you
can't see can't hurt you guys we have
beautiful lights and then no easily take
off our hamster curtain just let it hang
that's where the batteries are feel like
fucking batteries we have a custom wood
paneling that I slaved over for hours
and a beautiful rainforest themed cage
rainforest I mean it's not as great as
some of them on YouTube but it's pretty
beautiful I really want like a popsicle
house or like a second floor for him to
like have more space to like move
upwards you know but this is sort of
what we're working with till I make him
a house I think it's pretty enjoyable oh
yeah I need one more thing there's the
nice sprinkling of toilet paper because
this is what ad likes to actually nest
with so here's adds cage makeover I know
it's not the craziest makeover ever but
it's a little bit and I'm
excited about it I think it looks
beautiful and now we can help prevent
their myths from sanding themselves by
closing as curtain oh yeah I hope you're
not too too upset if dad doesn't come
back out I don't think he's going to I
think he called it a night once he got
all that food in his pouch you know he
was like I'm ready go bed he had a very
stressful afternoon getting his house
changed so we'll let him sleep but I'll
keep you updated I'll keep you updated
on the coconut Hong he likes that and
how the curtain works in terms of the
dogs because I know there have to be
people out there that also have dogs
that bark when they see the hamster but
I know this wasn't the most exciting
video but my soul feels much better I
think it came out really nice and
hopefully when Julian comes home later
today
this will bring him a little bit of joy
you know because everyone likes seeing a
beautiful rainforest themed hipster here
yeah that's really it I really
appreciate sometimes I just need to make
regular videos that are just decorating
a hamster cage because I needed to do
this anyways and it really served a lot
of purposes for me I feel much better
and make sure you subscribe to my
channel I put out a video every
Wednesday / Thursday yeah I'll see you
guys next week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
