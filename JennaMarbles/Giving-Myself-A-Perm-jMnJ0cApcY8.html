are you doing welcome back to another
episode of Jenny's ratchet so it's been
a while since I've done something to my
hair or any part of me and I'm getting
bored like I shaped things into my
eyebrows and that made me feel better
for like a day but I'm bored again so
it's time to do something and I was
thinking to myself first of all I have a
wedding to go to this week can i fuck
about it what can I do and I've always
wanted to do teenage girl me always
wanted a perm always just like how I
could never get any hairdresser to ever
dye my hair blonde feel like it's bad
for your hair oh it's not good for it
you're not gonna look good with blonde
hair and I would ask my mom like mom can
I / my hair she's like oh my god no it's
so damaging on your hair well guess what
from Jenna I'm 30 and I'm here to perm
my hair huh perms have gone kind of out
of style
and yeah well what the only ones that
I've seen recently is like guy tank
giving someone like semi-permanent beach
waves and yes to be fair I'm not gonna
do like tiny little curls I'm gonna do
like slightly bigger curls but not
exactly beach waves either like I want a
perm but not like a full-blown one my
hair is very damaged very processed I'm
gonna be lucky if I have any of it at
the end of this and so I got all the
supplies that I need and I'm just gonna
do it I washed my hair but I realized
that I have to do this pretreatment yeah
I did put a little olaplex in my hair
but not the good kind because the guy
was like I can't tell me the other one
since you're not a beauty professional
and I was like um excuse you I have a
living breathing online resume that I
think more than qualifies me to be
professional so get fucked I'm gonna
need a lot of Julian's help because I
can't do it all the way in the back it's
the clear goo yeah this smells like ass
your hair is longer this wouldn't be me
parting my hair I'd be perming your hair
really tight I have a question for you
Julian why do you put up with me you've
got to be the longest-serving
independent
history calling about Bernie Sanders
perfect sander honestly truly what my
hope is is that my banks get pearls
enough so I can cut myself some curly
front things hi pony right here like
half up half down with a scrunchie in a
dress at your wedding
invite me I have to cancel going to the
wedding that's the ballgame tomorrow
okay imagine me on the basketball court
at my basketball game tomorrow
flowing curly red locks I haven't gone
to a proper hairdresser since what last
December hairdressers are overrated guy
tank I'm coming for you print your
business is basically shut down okay
because I am the beauty professional on
YouTube get fucked
who's there I'd like one fuck me up
there do you remember the MTV show next
yeah if I was on that show like hey I'm
Jack Daugherty I have a basketball game
tomorrow and my tank is ruining my hair
get the fuck back on barely this stuff
like burns your skin and trick any of
this goes terribly wrong I'd like to not
have skin burns feel the perm not the
burn I think if this works you're gonna
be fuckin jealous and so is everybody
else
they're gonna be like bitch how you get
that tiny curl but mostly crunch in yo
hair like here's my business card
I'm kidding I love my rinse this out and
come back and then we can start the park
so my hair is like a little bit wavy
naturally but since I dye it so much you
know it dries confused when people see
me I want them to think to themselves
wow should I call the police
that's what I want to look like
number one of the salon is don't be
nasty and you know that now guy Tang
said we could leave some of the end out
here by the way last night we thought it
was like dark we went upstairs to go to
bed we found an entire bar of soap in
the bed with a giant tooth mark in it
car mate your soap fetish has finally
gone way too far
ready yeah we're doing the top you think
it's just gonna program the underneath
wrapping my hair for its funeral in my
own salon okay let's do two two and then
one banks
unlike some boring people I want my
bangs to be firmed as fuck oh hell yeah
now we can move on to the actual perm
uh this is like mediocre at best but we
don't did it Julian oh that smells awful
time to fuck me up Sam you ever go to
the backyard and you find a bag you're
like is that a sandwich and you realize
the sandwich has been there for like two
years and you open it up and smell it
hey that's kind of dramatic you're
spraying it everywhere on my scalp I
kind of I'm gonna be a burn face my face
stop I think I'm gonna leave this on for
like 20 minutes it's time to kick it
time is up Julian will you please help
me rinse my hair out oh that's cold
I just wanna be a beautiful red curly
head
shake neutralizer shake it you're really
perming my hair no Julie don't the sound
of you with that knife sounds like a
pirate oh my god boyfriend is out of
control
he permed my hair against my will and
now he's waving a knife for him
alright I'm gonna leave this in for five
minutes and then we get to fake it out
the time has come now we gently take out
the rod when I start down here yeah it
doesn't look like any of my hair fell
out so that's a good at all I'm upset I
want my money back Julie and I have a
face frame oh wait is that curly oh I'm
doing this it's not it's always time to
dick around okay
I'm gonna rinse and then maybe Drive so
wait for this hair right now look so
straight so I guess this is what it
looks like wet I can't really tell if
it's curlier this is like my natural
texture so I'm gonna go blow-dry it and
then be back right with the final reveal
this worked or not if not let's go to
the store and get another one
and I was blow-drying it but I don't
have a diffuser I didn't put any product
senex I wanted to see what it looked
like so this is like halfway dry it's
definitely not curly it's like wavy see
all these waves I just look like a like
a dirtier version of myself you like is
it bad that I kind of like it it
definitely feels incredibly damaged in
the front
look at these curls in here it worked
it's not curly it's wavy I thought with
this like it would be more curly but I
kind of like it I think I'm gonna go sit
outside for a little bit and let keep
letting it air dry and then I'll give
you a final look
oh look like the bottom half of a
sunflower it's really fun it's nice and
fluffy and big this level of damage
takes such hard work and dedication our
bangs didn't curl like hardly at all
hell yeah I mean it's not like a 70s
perm you know it's a little looser than
that but this is probably the tightest I
could go without it completely breaking
my hair like I really I'm having so much
fucking fun right now are you kidding me
Harley encontr√≥ girl I'm coming for
your brand holy shit
we might sleep it on pervs y'all this
shit is fucking fun my hair feels
terrible it smells terrible
but like I'm like so pleased this is the
second time I've done my hair myself and
I'm like actually this is kind of
fucking dope I'm Jenna I'm sorry
welcome to forego season bitch come
close to me and I'll tell you what your
problem
touch to touch this and tell me what it
feels does it feel good feeling let's
just say it looks a lot better than it
does it's very frizzy and very dry but
you know I think it looks really cute
I'm overall very pleased and this box of
perm cost like eight dollars so like for
$8.00 this isn't awful plus labor no
labor was free that's pretty much it I
can't believe we did this
my worst fear was that it wasn't gonna
get curled at all it's not exactly curly
it's like pretty much wavy but I'm ten
out of ten please would recommend make
sure you subscribe to my channel I put
out new views every Wednesday Thursday
goodbye Julian you're next let me just
do you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
