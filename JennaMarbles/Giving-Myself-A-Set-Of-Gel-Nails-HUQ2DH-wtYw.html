time you're like javis Sally Beauty card
and I'm like no she's like it'll save
you like $20 I'm like you know what I
found out about myself that I like to
take my money and chuck it into the
toilet and flush it hey what's up you
guys yes just a couple days ago I was
sitting on the couch in that friendship
and we were trying to find something on
YouTube to watch that was relaxing so of
course I was like here I'll turn on nail
career education here I was thinking
that Suzy of nail career education did a
lot of acrylics but she's doing this
thing called gel nails now forgive me as
a person that does not go to the nail
salon very often clearly I thought gel
was just like the gel polish I had never
seen anything that was like gel acrylics
but it's basically like instead of you
acrylic powder and acrylic liquid it
comes in a gel form and it just fucking
stays like that until you put it in a UV
light so we were sitting there watching
it and I'm like damn that looks so hard
so frustrating why would anyone do that
I go upstairs I like go to the bathroom
change my clothes put my contacts in
come back downstairs and Suzie's still
crafting one fingernail out of this
shape so I'm like you know what I want
to do is I want to try it and then
compare it to on a normal person scale
the level of difficulty it is compared
to acrylic nails so I know this is a
similar video but to me is very
different because I did not know that
this existed I think I'm gonna different
into this rose look at that what the
fuck is that but that's the pink let's
open the translucent very curious you
know so something I struggled with so
much with the acrylic nails was the
liquid to powder ratio so maybe I'm
thinking a way to bypass that and to
have beautiful acrylic nails is to use a
gel
there is this is everywhere I'm gonna do
a little primer I don't know what it
does but Susie says we need it I'm
reusing these kiss nail forms I'm doing
good already one mistake I made in my
first video was that these were pointed
down I ended up with some hottest witch
nails you know what I'm saying
what I like about gel nails already just
from my first impression is that it
seems like you started just dip your
brush in here and go for it which I'm
all about so I'm just gonna grab some of
this nasty disgusting whatever this is
and jam it on my finger now usually with
the acrylic like you can clean it up
with the acetone but I don't know how
that works with this do you Julian
mm-hmm you serious no you just spread it
on there and then you're gonna have a
nail a bit I don't know it's not really
looking like a nail yet gotta get a
little more that looks like a good
amount right okay this seems like it's
getting out of hand already I want to
make it like hella long how the fuck are
you supposed to like maybe if I just let
it chill it'll go into a nail shape I
don't think that's a good message how is
anyone supposed to work with this it
just goups on your brush more every time
you touch it unlike the acrylic or you
can just like dab it on there and then
get some acetone and like shape it
there's no hope for this like look at
that so that I take my goopy brush and
jam it back up who thought of this it's
so uneven everywhere but the length is
amazing let's get it under there see
what happens
Oh like is it gonna penetrate when it's
that thick see this side how it's all
like dripped down that's what the fuck
I'm talking about knowing your kid used
to take like your Elmer's glue and used
to put it in your desk and let it dry
until the next day and then peel it out
and you get like a piece of glue it
looks like that on a finger so it looks
like we need like another layer or
something like this isn't right
I mean I'm very pleased with the lake I
think the length is very reasonable very
natural very Kylie Jenner bye my lip kid
definitely putting more you
no I'm making it thicker dog feces with
three C's I gotta fill in these gaps try
to polish a turd dog let me live there
is a big gap right here from where I
couldn't quite get the gel in yeah okay
it doesn't look amazing it's a little
thicker at the tip but I mean no one was
ever mad at a thick tint
oh it's starting to hurt I feel like
that's a good look Julian
wouldn't you agree no agree with me I
would not agree let's keep going all
right let's make a square one I mean
it's very similar to eating spaghetti
because it cures in the UV gel in theory
you can just jam something in here and
then put it under the light no I need
something to jam in my nail
Julian suggested that I try putting a
sour patch kit this is gonna be too hard
look is this how artists do like 3d nail
art isn't they're gonna be Sour Patch
Kid in this gel no let me put that under
there and see if this works cuz I feel
like this is an incredible medium to jam
things onto your nail with like instead
of wow I can jam anything out of my
nails with the clear one alright so this
one is baked and ready to go oh it has a
tail but look at the sour patch kid
this is my new favorite nail thing ever
acrylic gel is amazing the sour patch
kit is completely intact and stuck to my
nail are you kidding me so this nail did
not count square I don't know how to get
okay that worked I just broke it the
rest of it is amazing look at that a
Sour Patch Kid on my nail do you think
that the sour patch kid is going to live
through the acetone oh I feel like this
is my favorite beauty tool that I have
found in a while
this is fucking magic I love you
Christine simply now logical but like
get on this fucking level girl you miss
it out this is where the funs at it is
so
beautiful it's a sour patch kids snacks
for nails okay
tastes like poison so now I've unlocked
a world of possibility
let's ditch the pink for a minute let's
like use the clear but it's like totally
and capsulated in there this is our veg
bad what I hate you dad you're like all
you need is a pot of this and UV light
and the possibilities are fucking
endless like Suzy I appreciate you but
you did not say how much fucking fun
acrylic gel is I think that's good okay
oh the clear one like wheelie birds I
think it's cooking my sorry edge kid I'm
just gonna take some of the acrylic gel
I'm gonna ink absolutely oh it's like so
it's gonna be preserved in time yeah but
it's like trap it's like fold it up and
like actually cook it's like the fossil
of OCA's it's plastic it's like the
fossil of stupid Julian you know I'm an
archaeologist
and I'm digging for stupid fossils
tonight ah
it's hot do you know what pain is yeah
physiological response stop doing
something never all right are you ready
for this reveal I feel like that's
encapsulated enough look at that this is
what the fuck I'm talking about it's
completely encapsulated in the clear gel
this remember how I said to my acrylic
fit nail video I was like this is the
most fun I've had with like nail stuff
in a while I lied
this is the most fun empowered nail
stuff in a while
this is some real 2008 hot shit alright
let me I need to get rid of this kid it
look a real regular except for the
creepy and weird like icicle tip I don't
get the icicle tip in terms of saving
you time this is incredible
so fast
like think of all the times that I wear
like press-on nails or something like I
feel like I could do this kind of fast
you know I really do press-on nails in
the car yes I could you could yes I
could and I would show up to wherever
I'm going looking absolutely nothing
like oh my god let me see those nails
that I'm like yes bitch here they are
and they're like you were invited yes
that was this is for you
I look at my nails I want to see how
buildable it is I want to see if I can
make it like actually 3d like I want it
to be a little mouth in order to perfect
this part you do have to have some level
of technique which I sincerely lack
alright so like a nice little blue bloop
bloop bloop bloop go oh my god Boop go I
can see it like falling like it's not
staying bloop dobbs
you're doing boobs until it stays up
look at that says blooped as I got it
it's just looped over to the side damn
it
alright let's try to do blooper sorry
Christine I'm coming for your polish
Mountain
well maybe the way
works is because there's gravity and
people were man whatever let's look at
Blue Mountain it's blue bowing yo it
came out a little hairy this is a weird
looking thing ever it looks like you
have an alien clock coming out of your
finger I'm gonna file off glute buttons
hairs it took me hours fixed it it looks
like it's giving me the finger
how you say homemade oh this one feels
good this one feels like how a nail
should feel what feels like nothing
looks the most absolutely
fuck your please yeah let's name those
styles bloop bloop Mountain
sorry patch please sour patch yes fuck
it all okay one fuck me up Finn this is
the fuck me up fam so for my thong I was
like Julian what do you think I should
do with my thumb and he was like put a
fidgets pair so we're gonna try I mean I
don't think it's gonna end up well I'm
not gonna use a nail form I'm just gonna
put the acrylic gel on here because
there's no need to have a long nail at
the end of it like I want to test the
limits of acrylic gel will it hold a
full fidget spinner do you believe stop
spinning you wanted to see if it's gonna
work like I've seen nail art with fidget
spinners like little ones people are
like Jenna do this do this but like I'm
not sure I've seen this attempted if
anybody's gonna do it it's gonna be me
if this does not get me a one-way ticket
into the beauty Durer community I quit
oh my fucking god are you kidding me
when I invented kit lens which thank you
to all of you that remind me I did not
invent candle hands when I invented
candle and I thought that I have reached
a new level in life but now I've really
reached a new level in life let's try it
again we're just gonna keep going until
it stays I'm amazed that it worked even
a little bit laughing I've done the
impossible impossible now something I am
concerned about is how the fuck I'm
gonna get this off welcome to Diary of a
31 year old ladies hello
I might say I'm the best at what I do
what I do
look if this does not get me into the
beauty guru community what will look at
this I'm sorry it's a doesn't like hello
Christine simply illogical who nail
career education who get on my fucking
bubble look at this get on my fucking
level like what if I showed up late to
an event I wasn't invited to and I said
look at my nails
hello 901 what's your emergency
yeah there's a lady with fidgets spitter
nails she won't get out right now
I'm just gonna go ahead and say what
we're all thinking
acrylic gel is the best invention this
ever invented yes you are I have candy
in my nails candy wrappers a mini
Mountain one sad fuck me up and a fidget
spinner nail from a real nail
perspective though like if you're
looking to do acrylic nails at home I
feel like you could do this and get okay
at it it's very difficult to work with
but like if you really sort of like
filed this down
and put some nail polish on it now you'd
come out looking regular and the fact
that you can just jam stuff on them and
then bake them under a light is like an
added bonus 10 out of 10 fun acrylic gel
is the most fun I've had with my nails
ever ever ever ever read this look
Julian you're walking past someone on
the street they walk past you where they
go what you do what do you do I think
Suzy from nail career education
sincerely downplayed just how wonderful
of a product this really is

house that has given you some nails for
Asian and to go to your local fucking
