lash technicians coming to drag me in
the comment section hey guys
yes the first thing I'm gonna do at this
table is the same thing I've been doing
which is forever on a quest to become
the most beautiful person that has ever
lived
undisputed hands-down so I am AB
youtuber first and only of my kind I'm
rare like a dragon right Julian go on
before all of the lash technicians drag
me I will give a disclaimer about what
I'm doing right now I bought one of
these Ardell lash extension kits now
technically this is called tabbing
because you're putting these little
knots and not individual lashes on and
it's also I think it's not like the same
kind of glue that a lash technician
would use to adhere your lashes
professionally because they apparently
need to be like separated and like done
really nice or like if you're looking to
get your lashes done like go to a
professional I think this is kind of for
people well like me right so you glue a
strip lash on occasionally but like
sometimes I just like I'm to stay on for
a little longer than that but this is
like stick come on see how long they
last there's been terrible reviews about
this remover that actually just burns
the out of your eyes so I will
never be used in that I will only be
used in coconut oil I'm gonna wash him
and treat him the same as like a lash
extension cuz I have had them once
before they were lovely but the woman
was like text me when you want another
appointment and I texted her and she
just never texted me back so I took that
very personally I felt like she just
didn't like me so I let them all fall
out never do it again when you get
ghosted by the master she ghosted me i
sat there silently at lab technicians be
like plus if it has controversial
reviews give it to me I can't wait to
try it does it burn your eyes does it
hurt them give it to me
yeah I'm like that friend if they're
like I think there's a bear over there
I'm the one that's like let me go check
I will say my experience with individual
lashes is incredibly limited I usually
use a strip lash and cannot be bothered
with
 I'm literally gonna read you the
instructions there's almost nothing on
here it says pour two to three drops of
lash adhesive on a piece of foil drop it
into the glue and then put it over your
natural lash and then the next step is
how to remove them the medical grade
glue or whatever a lash tech uses like
your eye needs to be closed because it
like itll the fumes will hurt your
eyeball this does nothing about keeping
your eyes closed or anything like that
so I think this is definitely like a
lower grade I bought this at the
drugstore type of glue going to get your
lashes done is pretty expensive which is
like my whole thing right if it's
expensive there's got to be a way to
learn how to do it and do it yourself
that's why my hair be looking so great
like I said before in my disclaimer I
think this is sort of like a you do it
once in a while I don't think it should
or could replace like a professional
lash the glue won't come out do not all
right so my lashes are very clean and
dry I just like triple-check them so
this comes in a pack of short medium and
long but I also bought like a ton of
extras because I didn't really know what
was gonna happen here today I've also
read that less glue is better because
apparently it might try a little crusty
oh look I just put a lash on so I pushed
it in there and then I gave it a squish
what do you think are we done here you
know wait why are you laughing woman
already came off and it's just like
breathe I don't understand wait so is
this one done now or should I try doing
it again I don't know the rules oh no no
that one's coming off too so far this
has turned out to be a challenge it's
not stuck all right maybe I need a
little more glue cuz these aren't
they're not stuck to anything right now
I mean to be fair this glue wouldn't
really come out so oh there oh
where life is glue Julian I need you to
stop it we're starting over
I got a lash I'm gonna dip it in a
little glue look at it I can't get it
straight now it's upside down
what are you having I'm trying to put
tiny eyelashes on my face
oh no this doesn't look real but can you
even tell Oh God like every single one
has to be like straight and pointed out
like it's almost impossible look at this
one
it just went rogue and came off
I'm not sure I've done anything more
like tedious and frustrating in my life
all the YouTube videos that I watched
we're all like so you just take your
tweezers and you put it on your eye and
then it's done you're beautiful
Julian don't remind me that I waste my
time I don't think that one's gonna stay
I thought I was gonna be able to do this
stop that's kind of pretty but like it's
not very good let's move on to medium oh
I feel like I'm getting a little better
I do remember the one time I got lash
extensions cuz I have like sad lids that
go like down really hard and then the
corner winds just so it just look real
sad and out you know that's not a good
book but that's my look I just want that
one straight into my eye oh they're
looking okay like in Julian come on I'm
trying my best
the corners are definitely the hardest
they like misbehave what this one this
one don't want stage left me I feel like
this is kind of time-consuming but like
I I feel like it's worth it so far no
yeah I guess it all depends if they
actually stay on my eye but like this
looks like a beautiful Harry set of
lashes
I actually want to run my fingers
through your eyes no no no you're not
allowed to do this I wanna run you're
not a lot woman feel your eyes is that
too long in the middle I mean I can't
say that I am having a good time
like the glue really a bit wall a strip
is like you take it off at the end of
the night but these apparently it says
can last for weeks is that too much do I
look extra because I have the too much
gene and I don't know when to stop I'm
not having any of these like people were
saying that they didn't really stick or
like that the glue is irritating like
I'm not having any of those problems I
am having a great time right now I love
you I think that looks really really
nice you can tell where the line may be
in the morning I'll give you an update
on how just like a night goes because I
feel like if they make it through the
first night there's a chance that
they're gonna stay on there and hang out
for a while but if they can't make it
through a sleep they're not gonna last
to be fair this was my right eye I am
right-handed it's about to go down
hey I wish I didn't have a nose it's
like a puzzle that doesn't want to get
done
compliments like that aren't compliments
no why why because I think it we think
that okay I just mushed two of them into
one like everything was going great I
have like one good eye right now it's
the moment when the Coens getting tough
but we just we got to focus we got to
get our left hand ready if I got my left
hand ready it's completely stuck to the
tweezers oh I think I might be gaining
some momentum change is coming oh stop
calling my left I see it right I've
never needed as much patience as I do
doing this takes the patience of a Virgo
to get the left guy done it's not
looking too hot right get off my tweezer
I just want to jam it into my eye at
this point there's a gap and then a
traffic jam yes it does he's gonna know
I did my lashes at home I don't know if
I can make it I don't know if I can do
it we're all tipping the wrong way oh my
god how does anyone supposed to do this
yeah they're all just like leaning into
my the middle of my face
I can't strain them out they don't care
about me it's like it's getting worse I
need encouragement you can do it like
the route like this one all the routes
are super even and clean and this one
they're just like everywhere I've never
been tested like this we encourage me
I don't want to be a lash goddess I want
to be done with this honestly I
understand why this cost hundreds of
dollars this is the most annoying thing
I've ever done so infuriating especially
for a Virgo like me who needs everything
to be perfect I'm very angry out what I
squeeze my eyelid knowing I heard this
feel like it's taking my soul with me
these ones all over the place these ones
are gonna fall off for sure Oh a longer
lash actually helped a little in there
no we did it oh is it like passable the
internet is gonna disagree with you and
then go roast me came out clean it came
out nice for the most part like the the
lash line is even it's pretty and this
one is like you can see all the knots
all the glue just everything is
everywhere this eye I can already feel
like some of them don't feel as adhered
as the right eye does I'm a little
disappointed for all diiemma I'll
squeeze my eyelid for all the amount of
people that do these types of tutorials
on YouTube they're all most of them are
just like alright guys thanks so much
for tuning in and I'm done and they're
like perfect and amazing where is your
struggle like how did you do
that okay they feel like individual
lashes so they feel like later I thought
for some reason maybe if this glue was
like more heavy-duty it feel different
but it really doesn't like you
yeah for sure I mean they'll flap in the
wind big time but I mean I'll least wake
up in the morning and show you what they
look like then cuz I have a feeling we
don't live you know in this video cuz I
have a feeling we're gonna lose some men
in here and in here
and then this one's just gonna stay like
this I don't think these ones are even
gonna make it through the night some of
them they just struggled their way on
there that's right like a deal breaker
for me if like I can only successfully
achieve it on one eye then like what's
the point we just being honest with
ourselves yeah you're not saving
yourself anything if you can't
do it right people be like Julian can't
believe this was very inexpensive but if
you're skilled at individual lashes
maybe this is a thing that you could do
for like if you had a week that you
wanted to have pretty lashes for if you
don't know how to do that left eye or
you're left-handed you don't know how to
do that right eye I'm not sure this is a
worthy endeavor my spirit is tested I
was broken halfway through I mean it
cost less than going to a professional
but it definitely yeah I'll check in
with you in the morning and we'll see
how things that going if I run into any
problems I need a snack in a large glass
of water I feel dehydrated after
directed this it took away too long
and I don't want to tell you how long it
took but you know what
I'll check in with you in the morning
it's the next morning first thing that
happened last night when I finished
filming was one of them promptly fell
out of this eye we played some video
games and my eyes were starting to get
so irritated even this eye which I
thought I had done so well all of my
user error started to just bleed out and
I could really feel that what is like
too close to my lashline and is poking
me there's also I don't know if you can
see I don't know how close I can get you
but all of the white crusty that people
are talking about in the reviews I am
experiencing even though I truly
believed I would be in the minority and
not have this happen to me it's not
super visible unless you were very close
to my eye but it is still irritating but
I mean they're holding up pretty okay
I'm supposed to get them wet for at
least 24 hours so I'm gonna give them a
fighting chance and not get them wet for
24 hours but they do definitely like if
I touch them and move them like some of
them you can tell are really just ready
to go at any second so I think the first
time I get them wet we're gonna lose
them good men I really feel like these
are an alternative to strip lashes
they're not an alternative to lash
extensions like even for the comfort of
your eye unless you're very skilled at
placing them which I know some people
are it this is just like it's really
bothering me like this one hurts a lot
in here and I have the urge to just rip
them out but I'm trying really hard I'm
really starting to feel the consequences
of my decisions on day two you know what
I'm saying
but I think you know where this is going
I think the answer is this is probably
not something I can DIY probably leave
this to the professionals and or just
stick with the strip lash it's isn't I'm
not feeling good some of the stuff I've
been able to DIY and been like you could
save a bunch of money this is so much
better this time I just failed but I
don't think it's this product I think
it's my ability to create this look in a
way that's even good for your eyes
what's so funny it's only been like
however many hours and more of them have
come out do they look crazy doesn't seem
to be forgiving how much mental trauma
and emotional distress that's due I
don't want to be beautiful I think I'm
gonna get some coconut oil and have a
funeral for them feel like I can't see
out of my eyes and Isaac irritated gonna
go ahead and gloop this on here I'm sure
these are great for someone know me is
this why I'm not allowed in the beauty
community because I'm too threatening
with my beautiful good looks that I
achieve at home for less I just oh it
feels so wrong I've met my beautiful
people match I don't want to pull them
cuz I don't want my real
lashes to come out trying to salvage
what I got left I didn't even make it a
full 24 hours
beautiful like sharp chunks of glue in
here I felt more uncomfortable than I do
right now bad that's really I know that
you're coming from a good place but it's
not helpful oh my god are they off oh
I'm free from the prison that I created
around my eyes well I think we've
learned a lot most of it I guess didn't
need to be learned but we learned
regardless and that's all that matters
I have a new appreciation for my natural
lashes I hope that they stay I like them
very much I will never wish they were
longer and thicker and fuller ever again
except when I want to glue on a strip
lash that's probably about it
or go to a professional this is just not
within my capabilities to hack theirs in
a life hack at all it's just like a life
punishment if you want to relive this
experience for yourself do so at your
own risk this has been my experience
