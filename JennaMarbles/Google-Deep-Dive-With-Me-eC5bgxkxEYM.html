of those days where like I can't make a
good thought if I tried to think it the
best suggestion on my facebook was tie a
bunch of planets to your body and spin
around and see how hard the fun has to
work I appreciate all of your comments
on Facebook YouTube I feel like you've
gotten so meta like I want to watch
youtube videos about YouTube pretty
minute right it's fuckin meta so I like
to do something that I'm going to do my
free time all the time forever because
this is all I do so I'm so fucked up go
on some Google deep dives where you just
start googling things and watching
videos and clicking on things until you
just don't know where you are anymore
Tamra goggles on ladies wait Dave your
oxygen stink no no I quit out of helium
so we did write down a few things that
we want to Google but I'm open to
letting the deep dive take us where we
don't die first thing that I want to
Google is something that's on snapchat
that blew my fucking mind because I hate
when I meet someone and know them for a
while and then find out that they have a
fucking twin it hurts my brain I hate it
so I want to look up some celebrities
with twins you don't even know who that
is see you are you kidding me tan Tamara
are there what show her that it's tia
and tamera
and Barbara Bush are twins just stupid
Alanis Morissette and way more than
feedback what the fuck I'm talking you I
did not know who's that guy the latest
Morissette had a twin brother this is
like my pet peed but right when you know
someone like your whole life and you
don't realize that between hey I have a
question though they're not identical so
what's the problem it's just like having
a brother oh it's so different
having a brother is born the same day
all this fucks me up
you tell me who weighed more if it is
her twin brother well what a blew my
mind is this Alanis Morissette and Aaron
Carter worked with very much was dating
his mother's womb for 20 years but I
want an answer for this
all right fuck it I want to see this
Hedgehog giving birth see why is Google
deep dive now we're down a whole point
of no return

of cute you all think that's cute

born why armadillo I'm just wondering
why cuz they're like scaly Demick armor
I want to see how they come out no way
egg your God so fucking turned on right
now
where are they coming from just like
cheek close okay when you're sleeping on
trailers eggs in your forehead watching

face yes this is good is so fucked up

to do with that I imagine these are all
I clean use a diluted Vegemite mix to
clean and disinfect cutting board pop
page utensils plates cups that's
ridiculous you babe Vegemite yo got a
nice reading process might remove
limescale build up like put some
Vegemite directly down your loo let it
sit for a few minutes then scrub with a
toilet brush for a sparkling clean bowl
hey if your nails are prone to flaking
slowly straightening them by it
regularly dipping them in bedroom I kill
life by spraying warm diluted
jahmai onto yourself so why do people
eat if it's clearly just made for
cleaning happy Australia Day y'all and
nasty is breast milk vegan human fluids

obtain consent what is someone who just
had nothing to lose like yo I consent
