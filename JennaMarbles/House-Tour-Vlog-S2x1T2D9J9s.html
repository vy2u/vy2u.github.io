moved again you know I didn't I don't
own this place just like I didn't know
min last place so we left that place
dude rooms and we moved into the valley
so this place that I'm moving in now is
actually a lot cheaper than the place I
was living here before somehow how does
that work I don't know I'm Los Angeles
and I make no sense whatsoever but this
place is really really awesome when I
actually go on Facebook what you wanna
see and you overwhelmingly wanted just
to see what house so you know and I
guess that's a good thing because I've
sent these packing and unpacking and
moving in and I'm really tired but just
a super disclaimer this is not a funny
video at all it's a vlog okay because I
can't do anything except vlog right now
because it's so real my life is so real
right now like so much adult things
happening and if you're watching this
video that means that somehow uploaded
on some weird fucking hot spot on my
phone because I was supposed to get
internet on Tuesday income they didn't
come all day today
see then I need a fuckin sleep I haven't
been like sleeping at all sand just been
trying on pack my dick
Oh dick Harry I'll show you ready to go
Carol of my boxes although this is maybe
like one-eighth of the boxes that it's
kept in packs time box of tires mom say
all the furniture that's in here is from
my old place because aptly decided to
buy all the furniture accident happening
so it's been through I don't like a real
grown-up truck I'll show you my office
if you want to see my office this is
where all my office stuff is this is
where Kevin Smith
Kevin here's my 2007-2008 Globe Award
from softball that basically just means
that people on the team like you and
that you should be real what everyone
else is losing their shit about nothing
because it still doesn't matter I told
you guys to do better
oh these my greedy guys guys you can
trust me that's my nude selfie I guess
it's not a selfie it's someone else
stupid well here's my autographed
picture of Bob Barker also know we're in
this house do I have any current because
there are just some curtains and how do
I react to getting and then anything
because I've been unpacking
yeah people can see right into my house
but everybody's really friendly so okay
these are like zombie current and
marbles and me though my friend Alan
painted of us those like my favorite
fucking paintings aside from three
dachshunds drowning this is the
Landingham I want furniture fit in it so
nice steel is so nice so much more
activities so the diner scene all
periods that's all the street the
chandeliers in this house are not mine
they they came with the house so we have
to take really good care of them even
though I'm not letting a chandelier
person I'm more of like a white trash
trailer trash than a person so it's kind
of fancy for me soldiers in Afghanistan
sent me I want to show the picture of
them because I think they get in trouble
for that but they sent me their flag
silly a flag box for this I know that it
exists Internet but that's like one of
my favorite tapes that anyone's ever
said me and someone sent me this
it's a gurney more page and this is my
favorite picture of Kermit ever because
he looks like super fucked up like a
Picasso painting but Chris Thompson took
this sucker ko6
someone set these to MIT my peel but I
think like hand painted picture of me as
a man come over that gets better and
then here is the hand painted picture
when I opened it I was like was pissing
my pants laughing so funny F car me it
was a week right now
he loves to like stick his face to there
just look liaison
it is do it this room that I have no
idea what to do it yet because I don't
have any furniture to foot here which it
gives us a big problem right it's better
than having too much furniture
this is my fucking bar mean camp and my
balls and the mikaelsons of the animals
and the sexy women this is the washer
and dryer that I had to buy because this
house would not come with milk to me so
I have to be big girls bye though it was
like the worst thing ever until it did
all of my laundry and I was like oh you
can stay yeah you can stay and then in
here off the room with no things change
this is the other thing that the house
accomplice was a fucking refrigerator at
first it was almost like a deal-breaker
I'm like come on dude look I'm renting
the place but then I realized that if I
ever move out I could offer to sell the
back to the landlord or if I move
somewhere where they didn't happen in
than it already has oh definitely by far
the most grow thing I've ever bought
look at this is my pizza
groceries and pizza for dinner this is a
treat
through our meal it's mrs. Norville
tweet oh my goodness
luckily that thing is up really high
because so I can't touch it look see
oh we have the capsule team started
unpacking my shoes and putting it in the
closet
so I was like why don't I put grown-up
stuff in there really good candidate for
my shoes where our bedrooms not really
impact when it's a little bit unpacked
but I need some time with so it's almost
because I boxes Thanks this is how you
packed baby jail baby jail is full of
nothing but fucking toys you guys are
brat children there's two sinks in here
so me and really Asia our own sink this
is my sink which if you've seen what my
other house it's significantly less
counter space which is actually it the
best thing possible for me because it
forced me to accept that had a good
morning problem and to get rid of glob
of goo so that I can fit it here this is
something that has never ever ever ever
get used this is the day I don't know
how to use it I don't want to use it
