to make a real-life video because raise
your hand if you did this to yourself
I broke it Jenna how did you break your
hand the buddies story well angel faces
over Memorial Day weekend I got
completely shit-faced and unlike my
white girls in the club video I did not
go out and make a complete ass of myself
I got obliterated drunk at my own house
and broke my own hand
I'm gonna tell you how I'm first I'm
gonna tell you the real story and then
I'm gonna tell you the fake story that
I've been telling people so the real
story is that we were getting really
drunk good friend in from out of town
and we're playing beer pong max told us
the next day as we're sitting in the
emergency room the hands broken that he
was spiking our drinks with 5-hour
energies which if you don't know what
those are it's just like a buttload of B
vitamins that they could go there's five
of us here Hannah Hart was here she was
an instigator
we were playing beer pong got really
competitive and for what I remember I
may or may not have punched something
very hard like a wall and poked my hand
now I've broken things in the past I
broke the middle of my face so I have a
scar they're broken ribs and whatever I
know what a broken bone feels like and I
was like that shit's fucking broken I've
never had cast before I went to the
emergency room and got some x-rays and
they're like yeah it's broken and I was
like out whatever they're probably gonna
put like a splint or something on it I
don't know and the guy comes in to wrap
it and he's like you're gonna have a
cast for four to six weeks the fuck for
four to six videos I'm gonna have a
fucking Club hand I have an appointment
on Friday and he said they might put
like a real hard cast on it cuz this is
what they call a soft cast although this
is hard like this is I hit you with this
you'd be like out I was like oh shit the
guy I really fucking broke a bone and
now I have to deal with the consequences
of being a drunk fucking idiot and even
after I got the castle's like yeah
whatever this isn't so bad like I'll
just use my left hand this isn't gonna
be a problem
at all wrong so wrong no one is allowed
to make fun of my hair makeup or lack of
spray tan because it is fucking
impossible to do anything with this
thing brushing my teeth
terrible terrible what's my other choice
do this and this my mouth I can't like I
don't even know how to use my left hand
I just take like the weirdest bath ever
shaving should be like a fear factor
challenge it was terrifying like look at
this good I can do that
ready oh haha using my computer is like
a form of torture I can't just do it
regular like this I have to be like up
like this or else my computer doesn't
know what the fuck this thing is if
you're watching this video on YouTube
that means that I found a way to somehow
edit this shape with my fucking left
hand sleeping on it's not that bad cuz
it doesn't really hurt that much but
like I'll wake up in the middle night
good the fuck is this occasionally
Kermit thinks this is like a fun cool
new toy for us to play with and I look
like one of those police dog Wranglers
he's like mangling my arm I've been
getting the ill cast tan from walking
the dogs outside not cool plus I'm
pretty sure when they put this cast on I
had fake tan on my arm so when it comes
off its gonna be like no it's gonna look
like I want to make a different video
today I didn't like but what am I gonna
do if I don't explain what's happening
here like the only thing I use this for
is just like picking up little things
and it's useless it's useless I mean I
guess I never realized how weak my like
left hand is you don't do anything you
have had a free ride for your whole life
and now push comes to shove and need you
to do your job hand and you suck at it
and if anything I feel like I've come to
the realization that this is just karma
back at me for making landshark you
don't have a hand then you're fucked but
you know what if I can deserve this for
saying things about people with no hands
now
now I understand and I still have half
of hands and whole other hands and I
still feel like I can't do fucking
anything I'm sorry people with no ends
but this is miserable absolutely
miserable and the worst part is they did
this to myself like fucking idiot I
dunno bear saying it is to go into the
emergency room they're like how did you
break your hands like looking at me like
I'm some girl and I'm like yeah I
fucking punch a wall I needed to have
max wash my hair of course he's a guide
he's just like they're good done I'm
like no you got conditioned it you gotta
like help me I can't I can't do it you
gotta help me

ripping it like you know what let's just
fucking shave my head shall we I can't
fucking do anything I can't put it up in
a ponytail look at this demonstration

stays - ponytail I've ever made for like
a month this is gonna be my life for

junior hey no I'm sorry does it hurt or
whatever don't be sorry
I did this I broke my own shit but I got
tired of being like a buncha walls being

started making up other ways to tell
people that I broke my hands which are
way more exciting and I want to share
