face is terrifying I'm sorry you're just
gonna have to get past it for a minute
okay so I've seen a couple of these
videos in the beauty community if you
couldn't tell I'm seriously like down
this rabbit hole and I can't get out
like you guys are entertaining the fuck
out of me I want to join on the fun I
want to be part of your beautiful people
Club what the fuck I've seen a couple of
these videos done where girls recreate
how they did their makeup in high school
and I wore very limited makeup almost
all the time because hey you've met the
Debbie Machine she's not exactly a
glamour puss okay so I didn't learn
anything from her be YouTube didn't
exist until halfway through college for
me so it's not like I could just go
educate myself and how to do my makeup
okay my exposure to it was I had two
books and I looked at the pictures and
they were all completely unwearable for
a 15 year old etc so I was left to fend
for myself and no one around me with a
war any makeup and also I was an athlete
so it seemed a little ridiculous to put
on a full face of makeup and then go
play a sport later so I wanted to walk
you through all of my makeup experiences
and looks starting from when I was a
young kid all the way through to like
college ish until then I started being
on the internet which you're all
familiar with that dark smoky eye baby
pink lit all day every day for no reason
this video would be incredibly
interesting if I was like a goth or a
scene kid but I'm sorry to disappoint
you I was not I was actually like one of
the most unmemorable people ever like I
can't stress enough that it kills me
when I see these 9 year olds with like
their naked palettes crafting perfect
little smokey eyes like what the fuck I
just had no information at all I'm ready
to show you the cringe because the
cringe is so real so here we go I
remember my first experience with makeup
going something like the following I was
maybe eight years old or so and I was at
my dad's house and I think my stepmom
had given me a little
Clinique lipstick that was like a bright
cherry red color you know to play like
dress-up and stuff so one day I was in
my room and I put it on and didn't
realize that a giant slice of it had
gotten all over my white turtleneck and
then I walked around with it on and got
it all over everything so I didn't
exactly start off on a good foot this
was look number one pretty good looking
if you ask me so my second experience
with makeup was one time when I was in
about fifth grade I thought my mom had
gone to work already but she had so I
put on some bright blue eyeshadow and
some pink lipstick and pink blush and I
was gonna go catch the bus like that and
I was not allowed to wear makeup so I'm
home wakes up out of her room and she
goes Jenna what's on your face and I was
like mom it's not a big deal okay I'm in
fifth grade now and I'm trying to get
the boys to pay attention to me this is
the way I'm gonna do it
why are you cock-blocking me mom she was
like I'm taking you to school so I wiped
off all the makeup we get in the car we
go to school and I go to the bathroom
because I was like you know what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna smuggle in this pink
lipstick and this blue eyeshadow to put
it on my kid there no I get like halfway
through my mom burst in the fifth grade
bathroom door and says Jack I seven wipe
it off I was like oh shit my mom
followed me to school oh fuck I mean she
had good reason I looked ridiculous
recreate that look for you explain I'm
doing stuff okay it was a good plan or
all the stories moms are cockblocks
don't you forget it so middle school is
where it started to get interesting
because I got braces I was allowed to
wear eyeliner and a little mascara to
draw attention away from my braces which
is infallible logic I'm still proud of
it so I can't recreate my braces but
what I do have is my retainer uh-huh
great stuff up with an empire late for
second grade
so you can imagine this but like braces
first things first I always had a middle
part but I would just like blow-dry it
so it came out to this texture my makeup
consisted of a very pink looking
foundation and the same color pressed
powder
this looks pretty similar to the one
that I used to have which means a
covergirl hasn't changed their formula
for a lot of their foundations in like
20 years
just conspiracy I'll never use any
brushes or sponges I will just let my
hands through the Picasso egg all over
my face and I would take the poof
provided for me and I would just set it
oh God it smell good I thought it was
like a real lady because I would put
this in my backpack and bring it to
school with me you know always with
compact I'm gonna touch up my powder so
then I would take sometimes black but a
lot of times in navy blue eyeliner and
I'll put it in my waterline and like
directly under my eye oh hell yeah and
this is like been around since I was a
kid it was this I would use this just on
my table legs no curler none of that
just some straight-up clear lip gloss
and that was like my entire makeup look
no blush no bronzer no eyebrows no like
anything other than foundation and
eyeliner mascara and I was like girl I'm
ready other important things for this
look chokers not cute ones like they
have now shitty ones like actual little
friendship bracelets or beads or I would
fuck up some shells like something like
that and it's my choices for hair where
the following this or one of these had
are you laughing the moon gyms render my
faces than my neck this is middle school
I can't even find the headbands anymore
it's like does this to your hair but
it's stretchy I'll give you the effect
oh yeah my mom had no shortage of these
fucking things in her room that I would
go in there and steal and relentlessly
try to figure out how to use now watch
her to it and I'm like this what
that this was a choice it's all
beautiful these were also a choice and
one of my personal favorites and if I
couldn't find these clips out of Justin
bobby pins and they would slide down but
I thought it was a good luck also this
was another look the little baby Clips
hold on
oh you see that all the functionality
you have so many choices you could wear
your hair up to come wear it down you
can move around all this freedom and
here's off your face it looks adorable
everyone like I love your clips and
you're like thank you so much easy
breezy seventh grade you don't have Stan
also sometimes I just want to mix things
up you know keep things exciting I'll
put on some blue mascara just on the top
I mean you can't really see that but you
know what it achieves beautifulness one
of my favorite hairstyles is when you
just pull these pieces out and then you
could like clip back this part or like
just leave it like that but make sure
that these pieces are out I'm pretty
sure in my sixth or seventh grade
yearbook picture I had this going on
exactly
look mom where's my clarinet mom erotic
piece of nuggets and I would always
smile like this in pictures like every
picture of me for like four years is
like this more like this about a
laughing couldn't control it I because I
never wanted to show my braces Bry the
bus lurches
my celebrity crushes where Carson Daly
and Justin Timberlake form in sync I
also like to listen to corn and I would
hang out cuz it's skateboarded outside
like I had practice later but like I see
you guys waiting for the bus my favorite
pair of pants with a black corduroy
pants anyways this is what it looks like
in middle school and it's fire literal
fire you're welcome for this tutorial so
then in high school I also graduated to
the point of wearing more than one
choker at a time or wearing things that
were not chokers as chokers like for
example this would be my choker and it
would go to school like that this was
also the first time I ever did a side
part and I was like
you can do that to your hair
remember I'm also the same person that
thought the people that didn't have
bangs just cut them off at the roof so I
mean this was news to me that you could
part your hair on the side literally
never thought of it before and my hair
was also in like a really short bottom
ooh
also I was just reminded that this was a
look remember this I fucked with that
sometimes same foundation and powder
routine with nothing else on top of it
because no one told me that looked
ridiculous and I swear on my life
this is the exact same product that I
had when I was in high school I was like
you know I want to do it's like a cat
eye but I don't know how so step one is
I'm just going to school win and
everybody so all this light stuff would
go here and then I would use every color
like that's what I thought you're
supposed to do when you get like a
palette of colors you have to use every
color in it and I thought this cream
eyeshadow was the coolest thing I'd ever
seen in my life
but well the fall and I would do just
like a little tiny round liner it was
just scared to try black it was nervous
it's a scary color so this is what I
looked like in high school you know -
blonde hair brunette got my driver's
license or like you gotta go to Wendy's
there's the moon again no nothing ever
in my brows it wasn't a thing I didn't
know what existed I would also like to
go to my friend's house and she was like
hey you want a near your stomach and I
was like hell yeah
so we would like near our stomachs and
for no reason her stomach was like a
little bit hairy so I get it but for me
I was just doing it to be a good friend
you know like I looked like this when I
did it also at her house we went into
her mom's room and her mom had this
green foundation and I was like the fuck
is that she was like try it it'll change
your life and I'm like dude fuck yeah
fuck me up with that I was like I don't
know dude seems like you can kind of see
all the green and choose like no now now
you make on top of it and then you can't
see any of the red in your skin
and I was like holy shit and she's like
see completely natural now no one can
see the redness in your skin and your
skin looks totally natural and I was
like holy fuck man this is my new look
this is the new me welcome everyone to
my new face I mean yeah I did I look
like this for a few days at school
before someone was like what the fuck is
wrong with your face
I thought it was and I thought no one
could tell the foundation color was
called mint you know like it you calling
me a ghost how's the other one did you
think don't cock-block me mom yeah I
sure did also in high schools when I
started to get really into makeup and I
got a couple of makeup books and I was
like this is incredible just didn't make
any sense for me I have a bunch of
makeup on so the only time I could do it
was in my room alone I was like this is
my dream the first look that I ever
created in my room by myself just
looking at a picture of some makeup
looked like this
and I thought to myself finally I can be
my true self it was on this day after
this makeup look that I decided I wanted
to be a makeup artist so I promptly told
my father who said no and I said but it
marked the moment when I finally felt
like my true self could be free when
could I ever let her out I've known in
my school wore makeup like this how
could I just go to school like this I
would get in trouble not allowed to wear
this much makeup turns out there's the
time and a place for everything and the
place for this is College because in
college on the weekends I would look
like this you know it wasn't like a
practice people were like who the fuck
are you dude I just saw you yesterday I
practice it's Jenna fuck you really
don't remember me Dave fuck I'm just so
unmemorable I still didn't know you
could put things in your eyebrows until
like 2009 Oh what yeah it's not a blood
that it just won't go in right now I do
then to like face things
stop family parties I got I'm not a
raccoon this was a look I was at a
really bad habit of making all of my
winged looks completely straight out
like like almost down until I realized
that it gave me sad eye what happens
when we put them all together well I
don't people wear these clips anymore
these are fucking dope all this that's
how we got finals tomorrow but I don't
go here how do I go anywhere so just
your posture usually need garbage ladies
also put my days garbage day I need to
go work
[Laughter]
I hope that you liked this video I know
that these looks aren't like too intense
because I really didn't wear a lot of
makeup when I was younger but they were
ridiculous and I did like them a lot for
any of you that lived through the 90s
I hope this just had to write in your
sentimental myths
