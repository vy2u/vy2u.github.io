super weird that no one ever asks for I
don't like explain it I just upload it I
really want to just give a little
explanation before I get to the weird
part of this video because I want you to
be in on the joke so for those of you
that maybe don't follow me that closely
on Twitter or like the podcast or
anything like that you probably have no
idea what is Sara meth going to grow
means I was reading YouTube comments and
as I often do and I got to this one
comment and for some reason I just had
the fucking giggles that day but it said
is Kermit spelled see er M et and that's
not the first time I've seen it either
I've seen see er MIT I've seen it all is
Kermit they talk to themselves in the
brain see erm et Kermit going to grow
and for some reason I just started dying
fucking laughing I could not get it out
of my head but those funniest thing I've
ever heard like I get asked all the time

Greyhound what is he but for some reason
it just fucking hit me writing my giggle

whole voice of like hello I've been
watching this channel for some time now
