it's been like super highly requested
that I do that how to do your makeup in
the car tutorial thing because like you
know when you're going somewhere and
you're like oh my god just hold up I got
Exuma mica but I'm like I could totally
do it in the car I'm really really good
at it I just wanted to create a tutorial
so that you can be really good at it too
the first thing that you're going to
need is like someone to drive you I have
my boyfriend he's gonna drive me around
so that I can show you how to do this
tutorial so we are driving up north to
go to a football game and we're going to
see my Paris hey we're going to a
football game how do you hear football
game I said we're going to visit there
yeah but I'm like friends with Tom Brady
used to The Bachelor noise what you're
going to need is all of your makeup
stuff like in the car you're gonna have
to like take over the entire center
console and like you can move your water
and stuff because I need this space
where do I put my water I don't care
baby
this is where I'm gonna put my stuff
because I need to have it within reach
Earl's it doesn't work so basically all
this like it's my space and then you can
have like that cup holder I get to use
the charger because you don't need it
because you're driving sorry I mean yeah
like I have a little bit of makeup on
right now because I woke up like this
just don't like who the fuck just like
has no makeup on it like gross
did you mean to do that oh my god if I
was fucking RIT right now it's because
my boyfriend killed I'm gonna shower
some foundation this is the easy part an
idea I should use the mirror I mean like
that's pretty good coverage for the car
like I told you guys I was good at this
so but you have to take such a winding
route Wow don't you on the highway or
something don't forget that you need
your concealer like just because we're
in the car doesn't mean that we're like
poor you just missed our turn by the way
yes again I told you I wanted to go to
in and out before me Tuesday can you not
because I'm gonna poke myself in the eye
guys don't worry if you get to where
you're going and but like you are
missing an eye like maybe get a new
driver next time babe what are we off
route it they explode down like I'm
getting knocked everywhere this is the
only way is there any way that like we
could drive in a different direction
because the light looks really fucked up
on you and just like I don't like this
like can we turn around no you mean
fucking drop shit if one of my contacts
fucking breaks I'm gonna kill you we can
just speed through this part bronzer
blush done boom bag like you you're okay
right now you're not being big so you
need to come out like all fucked up I
swear if I could just be like
reincarnated into a boy everything would
be fantastic
cuz all you have to do is just drive
slower are you on your phone right now
the directions aren't gonna find
themselves you're not helping I am
helping you're doing your makeup yeah no
one wants an ugly girlfriend my brush
just dropped down there can you get it
nominee is I'm like a little palette of
colors because you never want to just
use one color because that's weird
can you fucking not so I'm just gonna
blend it into my crease the darker color
the one that's like over there but I
can't even really show you because I
think I might actually die while we're
here it's already coming out like okay
because I'm good so I'm trying to teach
you how to be good also because I know
that like nobody's car game skills are
on my level at all not even close
you see Lady God she looked like a
leather bag do you want me to just pull
over no we gotta get to the game oh my
god hey I mean we're getting somewhere
where I don't know now is the most
difficult part you have to do your
eyeliner without gouging your own eyes
oh my god Wow it like Poteet my seatbelt
just locked like that's how you're
driving right now baby I'm sorry
oh I'm usually so good at this I
understand people that don't like we got
their eyeliner a little bit like what
are you doing

gonna get so much done right now the
lights green what see how good that
looks for like in the car it's pretty
bomb I have skills baby they in one lane
I can't turn if I stay in one lane okay

gonna put a glass on top of it so it got
everywhere are you kidding me you don't
understand what it's like okay do not I
swear you're like doing it on purpose

maybe she's born with it maybe it's just
my talents okay so the tricks of mascara

cheat aren't you did you find her it's a
guy no it's not Kelly yeah that's a
guy's name no thinks oh my god I just
wouldn't like to the middle of my lid
I'm such a nerd I mean if you can't get
it all the way in your lashes is just
like who cares but like at least it
looks better then like you just showed
up like a dick you know
like some people do to everything I
won't say any name so natural fuck okay
those names are doing aroused in the car
is that they come out extra hairy
looking because you can't control your
hand and your boyfriend can't control
