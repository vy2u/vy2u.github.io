to breathe the loudest so a couple weeks
ago when I posted on my facebook what
you guys wanted to see from me I wrote
that I was gonna park in a parking meter
and not pay for the meter because I live
my life on the fucking edge someone
commented on there for your next video
you should describe more ways to live
your life on the edge well for the most
part I really follow almost all rules
and don't really take very many risks
because I don't like hanging in trouble
I'm scared of Authority mmm and I don't
do all these things but I did cook them
up in my brain and some of them I have
done maybe this will give you some ideas
or inspiration without further ideal
here are some suggestions of how to live
your life to be on the edge next time
you go to mail something to your friend
just don't seal the envelope so maybe
they'll get the letter maybe they won't
it only gets worse from here next way to
live your life on the edge next time you
get a new bag card or like a debit card
don't write down anywhere what's your
new PIN number is it's like a memory
quiz and a gamble with real dollars
never bring your pack to a hotel it has
no pets in the pool just wait till the
pools closed and everything is really
late and just dip your dog in there oh
you're in the pool that's what I do all
the time when your gas tank is on empty
in your car to see how long you can make
it it's a super fun experiment
especially if you don't have like a
newer car you like an older car that
doesn't tell you like how many miles you
have left who knows you'll never know
until you just drive it till you run out
of gas so I got at least one time if got
all attack I do it all the time because
I just don't fucking really go on the
station because fuck that along the same
lines if you ever get a flat tire you
should just see how far you can go with
your flat tire I've done that before and
you know what happens the tire wears
and the center staying in your tires are
taking sparks on the pavement and that
you use trouble for it eat food at a New
Mexican restaurant never been to before
and then go work out medially after life
on the edge next thing you can do is
bring your cat to a dog park or you can
just douse your bunny rabbit in barbecue
sauce and bring them to the dog park and
see how fast they are the epitome of
life on the edge is playing Wii without
the safety straps especially if you're
doing like bowling baseball some sort of
we sport for you're definitely gonna
ruin something just don't know what
that's the edge part what a brush
straight to your dick or you just play
Wii with your dick strap the controller
to your dick and play Wii that way
another way to live your life on the
edge is to tell people to surprise you I
do this all the time at the hairdresser
pretty much every person that's ever
done my hair I just they go
what do you want I'm just like I don't
know surprise me and most of the time I
just end up with what I usually have
turns out that hairdressers like to err
on the side of caution but other places
you could say surprise me or tattoo
parlor mmm fucking that's that's really
life on the edge
that's her life or here some that I
thought of for all of you people out
there with limited bunny but a strong
desire for friendship go into a pet
store say I have $30 slimey a creature
you don't know what you're gonna end up
but it could be your reptile it could be
a fish it could be a hamster it could be
one of those centipedes it could be
fucking anything but you're allowed to
say surprise me now you get yourself a
new friend every time you go to your
friend's house or use someone else's
computer or like use a computer lab at
school always leave your Facebook
Twitter Gmail just defaults side me and
keep me logged in it's fucking you never
know what's gonna happen every time on
TV when you see something that says
don't try this at home
oh say okay and then go try to your
friend's house you really want to live
life on the edge so next time you get
the hiccups don't try and get rid of
them see how
long you keep them just get really weird
with it here's something I like to do
every day hey because I'm lazy and
b-because I like to live with like on
the edge I like to go and see how long I
can go about my day without putting on
my glasses things just turn into an
obstacle course you can swim with your
mouth open with your doing in a lake at
an ocean in a pool you're taking big
risks all over the place you swimming in
the public pool it's like so hot out
it's like right behind the library he's
gone ah underwater the whole time
fucking wild dude who does that you do
because you're living your life like you
give a fuck
anytime you're in a quiet space you'd be
like a tennis match maybe you're in the
library
maybe you're somewhere weird it's sort
of frowned upon to eat loud things or do
anything laughs oh bring a really loud
snap like some carrot sticks some celery
up in there like some chips see you're
sitting middle seat on an airplane make
sure you bring yourself like some
fucking chips a whole bag of chips like
a big bag of chips
it's a dip and then take a both the arm
rests like fill the edge another way I
like to live my life on the edges
whenever I call to order like takeout
they're like oh thanks for calling
bollocking put your arm off for a second
you just go no you can't go starving I
mean who's who's gonna say no to that
Angie get what you want
sorry ma'am you're gonna have to tell
whatever assholes in front of your face
that you have an asshole on the phone
you do your math homework completely in
pen next time you take like a scantron
like a bubble test do the whole thing in
number one pencil and then when your
teacher says that they can't put it
through scantron machine and they get
zero say actually no I don't I use the
number one pencil because number two
pencils are for losers you're not first
you're last pencil when you're watching
something that you recorded on your TV
and you're skipping through the
commercials - forward it on the fastest
thing go - and then press my I try to
stop it at just the right time chances
are that you owe and that you see half
way into what you were hoping to keep
you surprised that's the lip on the edge
right there you just never know you
trust your finger in your eyes I don't
know do you invite your friends over and
put your iPod on it
entire music library on shuffle wellhe's
this musics like kill yourself playlist
right now oh sorry guys how did they get
on there the last way to live your life
on the edge is to plug something in
computer like an USB port or whatever
instead of ejecting it like you're
supposed to just rip it out they don't
got time for that shit even a little
bubble comes out the says you may have
just lost everything on your drive well
you know what the risk I'm willing to
take because ejecting things just is
stupid my boy are you farting on me it's
like vibrated curvy smelly

birthday
