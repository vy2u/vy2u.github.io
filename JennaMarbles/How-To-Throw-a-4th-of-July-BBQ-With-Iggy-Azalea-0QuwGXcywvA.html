realest at the whole world fell at our
does that so I just arrived here from
Tokyo and I took the fast thing which is
actually like a particularly nice ride
as opposed to some of the other ways you
might get here to 4th of July public
holidays coming up soon I don't know
what you thinking like Iggy what do you
know about an American holiday because
you're a nosy and all that it's no
workers though because I've been living
here for like two years so I think I
know how to throw sick Barbie you know

festive hopefully you'll have the day
off and you don't have to go to work

you get to spend it with your mates and
your family and you won't be like alone
like no money no family 16 in the middle

gonna lie I'm pretty fucking rich and
hot so first things first the best time
the happier Bobby is a novel and for
those of you who don't know what the
elbow is it's like right when the Sun
like kids out of your arm Gigi why we're
gonna decorate all table heads I got
this nice tablecloth active like
American if you just want to decorate
your entire party with things that
scream like patriotism and independence
to like this kangaroo here hey Deb's
cheeky little buggers a beauty history
for you Americans actually wrote on the
backs of kangaroos while they were
fighting for their independence so I
mean they're actually quite festive next
thing we're gonna put on table
koalas because if you look close enough
at the American
Legg there's actually koalas on it right
to make everything feel extra festive
we're gonna put some Aussie flags there
similar to the United States of America
flags except I don't know they're just
like a little more decorative you know
people will automatically see like oh
it's an Aussie flag but it looks so much
like American so just they'll get it you
know yeah yeah merica who did who did
Gigi this would be like a really festive
bag to bring you're gonna need some food
to feed your guests mine's actually in

nice American cheezles my favorite
crisps you put them on your fingers like
this think about America yeah America's
a sick culture cut is good next oh it's
another great American food Vegemite
I've heard that all the kids growing up
in America they love to eat Vegemite
sandwiches so no Bobby would be complete
without Vegemite everyone loves it

just went ahead and ate some but there's
still enough in there to feed like one
