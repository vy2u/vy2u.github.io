a fashion guru okay payback is bitch
Juliana guess what today is
it's I bought my boyfriend's office okay
bad guys in me getting you a wonderful
couple of outfits for no reason a few
weeks ago I posted a video on my channel
where Julian went and bought some
clothes for me it was really fun I had
so much fun making that so I did it I
went and I bought you some clothes like
the style icon that I fucking am okay
I'm not gonna argue the latter part of
that statement but I did a really good
job and you're glazing over that you did
you really did a good job and I was
really proud of you but I was excited to
do this for you it's a little bit easier
I feel like because certain pants yeah
with girls there's like skirts and
dresses all kinds of shit happenin but
like I had an easy time and I barely
logged when I was out in the world
because I'm a little too timid to do
that shit scared to vlog I also don't
know how you do that my hands are full
of things it can't also film myself
whatever why don't you describe your
personal style sophisticated okay no
elevated no full with finesse no
athletic there we go one accurate hold
on athletic but business I feel like
Julian has a couple of looks one is very
athletic wear
one is like jeans and a shirt or like a
jacket and then one is like pure tux
this is like three looks
yeah three look this is like with Julian
wearing nice high socks oh debat cool
shorts sneakers this is like what you
look like every day unless you're going
to jujitsu oh I'm sorry I forgot your
fourth look which is just Aggie so I
went to the mall and I got you some
looks I think you would like and some
looks that I think you should try I want
to be dressed like a doll dress to go
pick one of your fridge build me a
dollhouse now it's like 90 degrees I
think she's wearing that giant ass fuck
yeah
so your first look is a total lay up
because it's something I think you would
wear don't look yet right I got you this
Puma like jacket pullover thing
oh hell yeah
unlike you
unlike you I didn't just buy you shit
okay I bought you outfit this is I buy
my boyfriend's oh you forgot that part
last time it's a kind of love you and
then because I like things that match I
got you these Puma pants too so you can
be role like those fuck so hard yes they
have like zippers on the side so I don't
know like sometimes you have like your
pants you roll them up sometimes you
don't go see how big you think I am well
that's accurate go try it out I'm ready
oh shit in 360 though I can guarantee
you really you like it that much
all do these pants show me your like
ankles put your foot up on this couch
okay triple again Julie oh shit this is
fucking tight I'm actually like I'm
pretty proud of it yeah dad you like it
it looks really good on you you look it
looks like something you would buy it is
something I took your credit card and
actually you bought it where's your what
can I say I'm a fucking style guru
okay and know what the fuck I'm doing I
mean this is cool but you really outdid
yourself with these pants so thanks for
watching this next outfit is like for
when I want to see you but I also I
don't want to fucking see you I want you
to just get the fuck away from me
again because I like things to match I
got you this beautiful set of camo
sweatpants and a camo t-shirt to go with
it
yo these are soft oh you fight is $30
which I mean yes you could get this a
lot cheaper it's army surplus store but
you know I splurged
thank you for splurging all over okay I
want you to put that on and then I went
to do this fucking I mean separately
they probably are really nice do you
like the pants what's wrong show me okay
I really like the pants and I do I want
to know what's social rule says I can't
wear this everywhere I got it like it
for some reason that looks really wrong
it really looks I disagree just make
them into shorts I need more room to
move think it's a pirouette to be
perfectly honest I'll probably wear this
all the time yeah it's soft it fits my
body well and I'm invisible ten out of
five love it I know that you bought me a
bunch of outfits for a step grandparents
barbecue I bought you let your clothes
were what so that you could truly just
become the actual dad that you are
so I got you these beautiful day khakis
khaki pants god they're beautiful the
brand is called Vinnie vine you gonna go
right to the vineyard and I got you this
amazing not like blue polo so you could
go to the golf course in it it has a
little whale on it and then remember how
you got me sunglasses well I got you a
present too okay I got you this
beautiful fanny

to be perfectly fucking honest with you
I don't even have khakis not one single
pair
I don't know how to wear them I don't
know what to do with them what to put
underneath them I don't know what this
business is is that kiss my my donk

fabric engaged so freeze a business call

projections we sold our company I'm
gonna take that back no snacks pizza
wait you're gonna be one of those dads
of snacks and you can tell ya there's
like a ziplock bag full of Cheerios than
their spare the ziplock bag Cheerios
going right in parliament are you ready
give me a third outfit so I wanted to
get you an outfit that you could wear
like when you're going out and just like
you're ready to have a good tongue night
on the town with the boys what I got you
was this I got you a pair of jeans
usually when you wear jeans they're like
they're pretty tight like all the way
down to the ankle like that style you
know and like the ankles they're pulled
up or whatever so I was like you know
what Julian's missing is a pair of jeans
that shows more of your beautiful thighs
oh my god wonderful quads and why not
just show them off a little the baggy
your hammies can breathe your quads your
glutes give me thank you for thinking of
my body nice and baggy maybe you can
roll them up if you want to maybe not so
this is what's gonna go in your bottoms
again very soft because I know you care
about fabric a lot you like things to be
soft I got you a beautiful red flannel
top that's nice yeah so you can go get
drunk in it and then to go to go on top
of all of that I got you a beautiful
denim jacket you're gonna put me in a
Canadian tux
yes exactly nice jacket it has like a
rainbow on it this is what made me buy
it it's like a really traditional
looking jean jacket but it has this nice
little pieces of foil yeah and I think
it would look really nice with all your
pins oh but I think it'll look super
good with your nice jeans and your
flannel shirt and your jean jacket and
then we can cover you in syrup and you
can chop wood outside I'll be the brawny
man
yeah you can sell me toilet paper it's
paper towel okay I hate to bring it to
you but these aren't real holes
I'm like so disappointed where did you
tie another layer of jeans I came here
like I was half kind of joke people like
why does that outfit look so fucking
good does it
yeah like it looks you look fucking good
though look it doesn't look like a
Canadian tuxedo at all they're actually
notice loose of a bootcut as I thought
they yeah they look too big yeah I think
I just got giant fucking hogs four legs
I like the jacket a lot you do yes
yeah fits perfect the jeans are a bit
different than the normal jeans I wear
and I think that's good also if you want
to see the brawny man I'll take off the
jacket and show you the brawny man okay
I do like that oh they're like some
porno music I can play and slow this
down
I really like this shirt it looks so
good on you
it looks so good with that beard too
like you are serving right now Julie
look at me I kind of wanted to just like
cover you in syrup but my plan totally
backfired you look really good in it how
am i doing so far
dude honestly way better I thought this
was gonna be a big tall job well I
thought I was trolling you but like you
look really good so he did get you some
last Jeff remember how you got me my
rawr shirt from Buffalo oh yeah so I
went to Buffalo Exchange and I got you a
few tops and a hat they're not full
outfits first one Julian always makes
office and Parks and Rec jokes to me and
I saw this and I actually got the
reference because you're so fucking
annoying about it but I got you a shirt

probably worth the billion dollars by
Sebastian I can't believe you bought me
a lil Sebastian shirt is that like your
favorite thing that I bought used to my
favorite thing that I own
also from Buffalo Exchange since you got
me a rawr shirt what I don't got you a
fuck it right oh yes this is great I'll

gonna do I'm gonna wear this under my
gives a raspberry yeah alright the last
thing that I got to from Buffalo
Exchange is actually very Shane's your
whole wardrobe just lacks a whole lot of

outfit and a Canadian tuxedo with a
flannel shirt and you look good in it
