video does he eat it you know what are
you eating so for those of you that
haven't seen the boyfriend does my
makeup tag video that I did one of the
most requested things after I did that
was for me to return the favor and do
Max's makeup that's was very excited for
me to turn him from my boyfriend into my
girlfriend with a beard the bearded lady
a bearded lady what ok enough ladies
have nice dark beards correct
Thanks waiting the jawline and my
birthday's on Saturday happy birthday to
me I'm gonna make next my girlfriends
sound we're gonna lays out last time we
had alcoholic drinks this time we have
caffeinated beverages nothing like a
nice out-of-control makeup video it's
good when your hand starts to get really
shaky wait max are you ready I am so
excited right now that was a great lie
just would like to point out that I did
try it to do my best I didn't like
maliciously makeup your face like I'm
sure all right well since you say that
we're gonna start out with putting some
foundation on yo you put on me like
sunscreen back sorry so it's your time
let me get it in your being so you
saying I did the right way
No why are you brushing the liquid
though it doesn't make any fucking sense
doesn't ruin the brush no just how I
like to do it luck is how you do your
boyfriend's makeup like you need to set
that nice foundation oh it is good you
like you have like dirty pubes as a
beard ah can we all right can we this is
the only thing when I asked this whole
time is can we please watch out for my
eyeballs
oh no the makeup goes like in and around
your eyes
it's just how makeup works I I know how
makeup works where I would be putting
your bronzer Max is directly where this
line of contouring is that is your beard
so we'll just make it like so your
bronzing my beard more define I wish I
had some of those
except not hair she's brought me at love
which it was that connected to your nose
bone no that's now when Max did my
makeup first of all he used the wrong
brush and then he used this like bright
pink blush so we're gonna just go ahead
and do the same for you first we're
gonna scoop it in there like we're
eating ice cream then we're gonna spit
in it like which is what you did to me
and then I'm gonna go look like a china
doll next you're blushing I'm nervous
here comes the exciting part eyebrows oh
it's a black eye shadow what do you mean
eyebrows eyes shadow don't like squeeze
your eyes shot you just with like gently
like you're taking a nap close it close
you're squinting no that's good thing I
am but if I touch your eyelid you can't
jerk your head back he's like I'm
putting the makeup on his lid and he's
literally like shaking his head back and
forth in case you didn't realize in the
last video I kept like jerking my eye
towards the pencil when he was lying I
cuz Max is like terrified of eyeballs
and things going in your eyeballs if you
think this is not we're not even gonna
be able to line your eyes line my eyes
with what eyeliner don't act like this
is a surprise to you you did it to me oh
that's good if you look like you're
pooping good fuck it let's do it so you
got all the way the bottom of the
eyebrow no your eyebrows are just taking
up so much of your eyelid because
they're brushy like a boy's but usually
there's more space there to put others
eggs I'm sorry
put other things yeah their color is
like blended into your background shit
this is eyeliner Max and where does that
go I'm here I you know where it goes
we're lucu on your eyes eye liner you
went to college not for fucking make
apology makeup all aji oh baby oh baby
oh baby give you a nice little
they don't like squish your eye around
oh boy I should get like ten points for
doing someone else's eyeliner like over
their head like this oh I gave you like
an eyebrow you look like you're gonna
like tie someone to train tracks come on
I give up in your mouth helps you not
like making this sound appears like now
I'm gonna get inside your water line
which is inside of your eye max you know
that right it's gonna feel weird you
guys looks like it's crying now well the
faster you do it the faster you're done
just imagine that you're on fear factor
and if you do this then Joe Rogan will
high-five you keep your head down just
look down look up go yeah cuz you've
like got you give me one of these think
of Jerri think of John Robie
how much you want a hug Joe Rogan Joe
did it I'm impressed I didn't think you
were gonna be able to do it what are we
doing your eyebrows girls good but I
don't understand why you don't just do
this every day because you look so hot
the reason I don't go out looking like
this every day I'd be pulled over he's

puts the lotion on its skin or it gets
the hose again but I'll show the fuck
