video so if you don't like relaxed
videos then you need to go away right
now because I'm about to unload some
doodoo all over the internet mm-hmm you
want to be all up in my life you're
gonna get all up in my life right now
I'd say 75% of the fuckery that happens
to me is my own fault because I'm like
borderline an idiot when it comes to
like being a real grown-up like for
example getting boots on my car that's
completely my fault
I was a bad luck with like fucking life
shit so I'm really consumed with what is
going on right now so I need to tell you
Aaron friend please let me do that
because I can't do anything else right
now so I live in a townhouse apartment
which means that you walk into a little
door and then you live in your little
Tower but on this side and that side and
then there's like five townhouses all in
a row so we live in a building basically
and I've lived here for two years and I
rent it from my landlord I don't own it
I told you guys couple videos back that
my house had recently caught on fire of
no doing of mine whatsoever and then ten
days later it needed to get fumigated
for the second times I needed to vacate
the premises so they could put a giant
circus tent over the entire building
fumigated for termites now the fire is
still not fixed
and I'm gonna show you that in a minute
because it's pretty ridiculous and I
downplayed that a little bit in the
video my questions video because it was
actually pretty fucking traumatic but
what I did basically was I called my
landlord told them what happened told
them what the fire people said and so
she had to call the homeowners
association which basically stands for
shit bags that owned their apartments
and do things along the lines of fixing
the property etc and that they were
going to come and fix it and it's now
been over a month and they have not
fixed it and then ten days after the
fire I need to leave for fumigation AIDS
there's a person that lived
and the ended of the building named
Jeannie and I don't know if that's a man
or a woman but Jamie is on the
homeowners association run email there's
one fuckin says verbatim you don't
vacate the premises you'll be
responsible for rescheduling it in blah
blah blah doesn't say anything like make
sure you call this person and RSVP and
we have a big fucking flag over your
head that said I'm vacating the premises
so you can delegate it just says get the
fuck out so that's what I did two times
last year and this year all I did was
leave I have my hotel bills and video to
prove that I was fucking gone and I
prepped my entire house which means you
wrap all of your fucking edible
belongings anything you could possibly
ingest in these special cellophane
--is-- bags and you do it two times you
have to twist up and tie them and
fucking it's a nightmare so ten days
after a fire app in my apartment
everybody there just exploded or just
died I still choose to leave for
fumigation don't try and reschedule it
and I pack up all my shit I go stay at a
hotel with my dogs for four days and
then I go to my brother's wedding just
fucking like woohoo a mine and then I
get back and get accused by the HOA on
our association of people with dicks
that are stuck up their assholes of not
vacating my apartment bitch please
so my lease is up and I want to renew
because I've lived here for two years
and might as well just stay in the same
place unfortunately the owner of my unit
is selling it so they're gonna give me
september/october to move out find a new
place sounds like cool that's fine you
know that happens all the time
I mean if I had to guess I would
probably also sell this place because if
mother fucking catches on fire and has
termites and bitches for neighbors I
mean this place is a fucking money pit
this is where your money goes and you
throw it and then you flush it into a
pit and it dies and it gets eaten by
termites and fire so because the HOA
accuse me of not vacating the premises
they threatened to sue my landlord if
they gave me 30 or 60 days or however
much they were willing to give me to
find a new apartment they wanted to
proceed with eviction like fucking
eviction like what kind of fucking crazy
pills am I taking when your owner sells
your unit get fucking notice to leave
you don't get evicted so I can't email
from a lawyer that's basically like you
better find a new place because we can
evict you and I go motherfucker I am
about to whip out every big word that
I've ever learned in my entire life and
use it in a very demeaning way in this
email I even googled the guy this is how
you know you have a problem with Eric
stalking like I'm a professional
internet stalker just so that I could
laugh what a dick
salad he is and he was totally a big
salad so I fucking emailed him back
basically saying like oh that's funny
that you want to try and evict me on the
grounds that I never responded to the
HOAs communications with me which as I
told you was one email that said this is
when it's happening and notice on my
door it's a death fuck out I told my
landlord I was leaving that's the only
person that fucking talk to me it's not
like anyone ever tried to call me this
person does Jamie literally lives at the
end of the building you can't like knock
on my door or I don't find a cellphone
number for me leave a note
it says can you please let me know if
you're leaving or not just doesn't say
fucking RSVP to the fumigation party it
says get out and leave your apartment
unlocked so we can get in so I did I
mean if anything the HOA and that Jamie
T Shi man woman motherfucker owes me my
money back for standing a hotel and
begging for fumigation oh yeah and
remember that fire that happened ten
days before fumigation they never came
and fixed that's kind of your
responsibility because guess what you're
lucky that I didn't ask for any
compensation whatsoever for the
belongings that were damaged and
destroyed in my fire and then I still
baking the premises and have every hotel
bill and video evidence of me being gone
the entire communication process half my
shit still wrapped up in fumigation bags
good fucking luck trying to prove to
anyone that I did not vacate the
premises there's nothing in the notice
that says something along the lines of
call this person until they tell them
that you're leaving and make a big
fucking scene about it just says bleep
so that's what I did
long story short though I have to move
they're not going to evict me because
the lawyer finally emailed me back
basically in legal jargon saying
something along the lines of hmm yeah
you're kind of right and we cannot evict
you let's just say you find a new place
and we're gonna sell the unit and I said
sounds fucking fantastic but I do want
to show you this fucking fire and it's
ridiculous so where am i basement garage
and that fan up there overheated and
caught on fire and melted dripped down
melted my washer and dryer that we're
right here and I'll show you them in a
second so in order to get in here the
fire people drop to my garage door in
half with a chainsaw and had to get in
the sprinklers put out the fire so
that's why it's still kind of like wet
and discussing and damaged so the fan
was above the washer and dryer and
melted the washer and dryer and also
caught all of my belongings on fire yeah
that happened over a month ago I remain
landlord
I would sell this bitch - I'm out of
here she's out of here rubies fucking
out of here
can I come live in your house like eat
my rain cheese in that sleepover fucking
fuck fuck fuck hurry fuck we will say
goodbye to this room and it's been a
good two years other thing that sucks is
that the only furniture in this house is
the beds because I rented it partially
furnished so like the couch and tables
everything none of that shit's mine the
TV's are mine nothing's my fucking
vitamins mine tomorrowland god so
wherever I move I'm gonna like happy it
fringe er like it's gonna be bitch
whenever you think that fucker he
happens to you I can almost promise you
that more fucker he happens to me just
just fuckery it's not that hard I live
in a place and it doesn't catch on fire
I abide by the rules and then no one
accuses you of otherwise you know how is
that I'm sorry for not is exciting
borderline shitty video this week but
you know what sometimes life just gets
really fucking weird and the HOA is just
full of people with fucking butt plugs
that they had in their mouth an hour in
their butt and then they took them on
their butt and put that back in the box
we'll do a new house if we don't find a
new house we're just gonna be homeless
