not gonna lie we're just crying for a
little while because I'm so frustrated
and angry with my living situation house
looks really nice but it is not a very
fun place to live
so today the washing machine and the
sink started overflowing and exploding
with water and so I had a really really
cool video that I was gonna make today
but unfortunately I'm probably just
gonna have to have a house full of
plumbers and people just fucking all up
in my shit and I'm just angry and this
also happened recently the fourth of
July weekend the bathrooms later the
bathroom in the back there in the
bedroom was exploding sewage from the
sink in the toilet and the bathtub and
the shower I fucking have had it and I'm
really upset because I like to save my
extras for Christmas time and New Year's
so that I can spend time my family and
looks like I'm going to use some of that
now to make myself laugh and maybe make
you laugh because I'm not laughing right
now and I would like to be laughing
instead of doing this so I'll show you
how fun everything is how fun everything
is look at this look how find my sinks
are isn't that fun I don't know what
that is but it looks really fun it
doesn't smell good no it doesn't smell
good here's the other sink oh that looks
fun too
let's take a bath in it yeah and then
behind the washing machine over here you
probably can't see it because I don't
have a light but it's just full of water
because the washing machine just started
spewing water all over the place so so
super duper fun like I just can't even
stand it I'm really really really really
really sorry to be uploading some extras
I don't really know what else to do
right now because I need to be here when
the plumbers and my fucking landlord
probably gets here really sorry about
this but I know a lot of you guys
actually do like these better than some
of my videos so for those of you that
like extras videos here's some extras
and
I have literally the worst luck ever
when it comes to apartments this place
is also full of cockroaches just ask
fucking Gina from prank vs. prank she's
been here and they were like five of
them the night she was here they just
fucking because the doors like aren't
sealed so we basically live in like a
glorified tent full of cockroaches which
is really super fun and we spray like
the house with raid like once a week and
that's the only thing that helps but
then not really they still get in and
they we have ones that are like giant
and flying and those are really fun too
because then they can like fly into your
face and shit I'm really sorry
like really really sorry I know you guys
are like oh so somebody said to in
Twitter like oh why don't you just
fucking take your Google money buy a
house do you know how much houses cost
in LA it's outrageous
I don't know how much money you guys
think I make but whatever you read on
the Internet is outrageously inflated so
that you click on that link and read it
not to mention most of us fucking have
companies and then caught ourselves a
paycheck like any other regular person
and it's not that easy to just fucking
buy a bajillion dollar house in Los
Angeles I'm trying to save up to so I
can be my own landlord but that's
probably not going to happen right this
second but it's a little bit different
than what you guys might think but I
yeah here are some extras and I'm just
going to hang out in some sewage for the
day I love you forever and make sure you
subscribe to my channel if you're so
inclined because I wouldn't have been
like who the fuck is this sad ass bitch
fuck that bitch she's fucking sad I
don't like sad people me either man but

and cry about how much you hate being in
sewage I'll see you guys next week
