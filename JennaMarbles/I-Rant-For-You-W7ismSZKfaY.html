don't really rant as much as I used to
I've addressed this in several videos
I'm not that angry of a person anymore
I'm a full-blown adult II there is still
a time and a place for it and when it
happens it goes down but I read a
comment on one of my videos recently
where someone said that they like to
play my old rants while they were like
at work at their desk just mindlessly
listening to it because it felt like
someone else was doing your bitching for
you and the idea of bitching for someone
else made me really excited so I thought
maybe a good idea would be to take other
people's problems and rants for them or
roast for them depending how you look at
this video I don't know yet we'll see
how weird it gets so I asked on my
facebook if there was anything specific
that you wanted me to like rant or roast
for you so that maybe I could be that
person that goes to bat for you this is
all a joke just listen to me make fun of
some things and just take it easy man
you know so I just figured I'd try
something new and if you hate it tell me
and we'll never speak of this again just
like lots of things I've done here are
the things that you asked me to rant or
roast for you
please rant about how my dogs barked all
day today they have custom bunk beds and
they barked all over the beds then down
the back of the beds then along the wall
the bunks are against and along the
windowsill
I imagine some passerby had to drive
past this house and see two dogs in the
top bunk looking out the window and
vomiting copiously these are the faces
of barf sure thing Casey first of all
who the fuck has custom bunk beds Disney
Princesses at YouTube second of all if
you guys are gonna throw up you have to
commit to eating it doesn't matter if
it's your puke or your brother's puke
somebody's got to eat it and then this
one better eat it out of this one's
mustache or else you guys can sleep
outside forever so if you guys want to
keep your privilege beds inside of your
bougie room you better start eating
please please rant about my bunny
tearing my wallpaper off the wall
two months ago I moved into a new place
with more space and wallpaper so this
little adorable ball of fluff has
decided he doesn't like the wallpaper
and has made it his mission to tear it
off the walls so because I love him and
I never really get angry he deserves it
please yell for me so I can feel better
hey buddy I don't know your name but if
you don't stop eating the wallpaper your
name is gonna be pop wrong baby because
you
getrekt your mom insists that you roam
free to ruin her home but if it was up
to me I would build you a prison out of
wallpaper no bunny friends
no bunny cell phone just a room full of
wallpaper that says I'm a shit all over
it maybe then you'll know what it feels
like to get your freedom taken away and
you'll keep your bunny mouth off of my
beautiful fucky walls just because you
have cool hair doesn't mean you can turn
this whole house into a garbage from
your mouth uh Melissa writes women
criticizing stay-at-home moms I know you
haven't dealt with this but I feel as a
stay-at-home mom people think I just
have fun all day sure Melissa hey haters
of stay-at-home moms you think we just
sit at home and have fun all day with
our kids
fuck no if this was fun I'd invite my
friends over and charge admission at the
door I charge five dollars a head and an
extra five dollars if you wanted to
drink out of the keg I do lots of stuff
when I'm at home all day but you know it
takes up the most amount of my time is
minding my own fucking business oh shit
Timothy writes people who come in late
to step aerobics or yoga and try to
squeeze in the line instead of going
into the back because you're late I have
a lady who comes in late two-step mind
you where we do front side and back
kicks and jump around and ever hands
flying so we kind of need some space
she went almost behind me and guess what
I stepped on her during a grapevine and
almost smacked her in the face doing
jumping jacks this is why we line up a
certain distance and need space rule
number one of step aerobics if I'm doing
a grapevine and you get hit it's your
own fault it seems like you can't follow
directions which is out of my control
but you know what's in my control doing
jumping jacks with knives get fucked
next time you don't respect my personal
space during tea ha ha class you're
gonna get cut bitch cut oh fuck Ashley
rights you should rant about my
neighbors coming into our backyard
during the summer to do the Frick frack
on our jungle gym and leave their
clothes lying around that really makes
me angry
no problem actually I get it Frick
fracking on your own jungle gym can get
boring spice things up come Frick frack
on my jungle gym I don't think so if you
don't find a new place to Frick wreck
I'm gonna cover my jungle gym and dildo
so the next time you brick back on it
it's gonna brick back you back Jade
writes my band director recently refused
to let me continue in band because I
didn't want to March I didn't want to
march because it stresses me out makes
unhappy and I explained this and even

hate it

and I would love you to rant about her
so I don't have to do that hey mom I
love you and in the least disrespectful
way possible if I wanted to see you

you want with your body but sometimes
you know you just you gotta respect me

people where I work who think it's okay
to make a phone call from the toilets it
makes me feel quite violated I can do
that hey coworkers you know the only
time when it's okay to make phone call

fact that all I want to do when I'm at
