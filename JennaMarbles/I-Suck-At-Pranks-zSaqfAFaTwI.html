could go like way awesome pretty sure
it's gonna go awesome come on
pranking myself right now cuz I'm making
oatmeal huh priorities though so for any
of you that watched Jillian's vlogs you
know that he pranks me a fair amount and
I always fall for it because I'm pretty
gullible and also just I'm easy to trick
that's really clean well like II fight
and something that's requested a lot for
me to do is to prank Julian back but I
am so bad at pranks I try you know
without a camera on and just fail
miserably every single time so what I
wanted to do joined went to the gym
right now and mind you you know I'm
gonna need 10 minutes to eat some
oatmeal here so like he's gonna be gone
like an hour I'm just gonna try and like
booby-trap the whole house so then when
he comes home I can prank him really
fucking good because I already know that
I'm really good at pranks so he's just
gonna not even know what hit him I
googled some stuff like I'm just gonna
make dudes what I have and we're gonna
see what the fuck happens you know what

sprayer things but this guy goes on

gonna do this real quick yes that will
show him now naturally I'm gonna do a
bunch of stuff to the toilets in the
bathroom because that's I really prank
somebody we don't have any saran wrap
but I do have some aluminum foil this is
gonna show Julian I am not to be messed
with just finish this bathroom this is
like some next-level shit ready hey and
not only did I wrap the seat but it also
wrapped underneath the seat which will
definitely fool him and also the garbage
can and toilet paper roll and the soap
and the sink and bolt said to candles I
mean he can still enjoy that but I mean
this is shaping up to be pretty fucking
I bet if you asked me so they did in the
bedroom

bed Julie

bidet no one uses fucker got you oh yeah

tape everything on a desk down because I
read that that was a good prank so I'm
going to do that my final prank the
camera up there and I'm gonna leave the
door open but the dogs go around so and
Julian comes home it seems like the
house got broken into and I got murdered
but I'm also gonna put this egg on the
door so that it falls on him when he
comes in yes Julian going down I'm
watching Julian I'm fine friends so I
can see when he comes home so I can pull
up the perfect timing I just thought
