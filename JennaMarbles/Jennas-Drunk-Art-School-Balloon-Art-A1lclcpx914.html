you how to paint with watercolors the
whole idea behind jetted shrunk art
school is Janice drunk brain is really
creative and awesome and can do things
just as good as your art teacher and you
can learn online for free from me
because I'm a fucking expert at
everything and ain't nobody got time for
real art school so just come to Jim's
drunk art school and I'll teach you all
the things you need to know in a way
that's much more exciting than regular
learning so I just got to say a quick
word about my P o box I've never done
this before if any of you ever sent me
anything to my P o box don't worry I got
it I have got letters I've gotten
everything every package you've ever
sent me a lot of what you see in my
house has been said to me thank you this
girl named Holly hopper she's the
twister sister she does balloon art and
stuff in San Antonio and was like you
know what you should do a drunk art
school with this and I was like you know
what Holly challenge accepted so I spent
a little bit of time today just looking
up some basic techniques and now I'm a
professional balloon artist the balloon
industry you could make between 20 and
30 dollars annually
so in Jenna's drunk art school I'm
basically going to give you a new job at
the end of this video you're going to be
ready to go out and start your own
fucking balloon business first step and
drug art school I'm gonna go get drunk
and I'm going to come back and I'm going
to teach you how to make the most
incredible balloon animals that you've
ever fucking seen I'm pretty sure it's
that I did a fantastic job of getting
drunk for Jenna's drunk art school uh
you know for not going to the art at
least I'm good at the drunk God God
Jenna get your life together God so
you're gonna take your penis pump right
weird first thing we're gonna make is a
poodle obviously we're here to do
you're gonna like inflate your balloon
like a lot less than you think
ready I don't oh that's too much right
so now in this blown industry they call
this letting some air up I got too drunk
make a little bubble and you twist it
like guys I'm hammered and I can do this
I know you kid therefore you can work
children's birthday parties like just
feel like here's my name here's my
business card
hands up an invisible one feel like oh
sorry I'm kidding this my name is on
there just hire me now the one thing
about balloon animal making is that it
never gets any less terrifying so you
have two little bubbles don't let go go
we're also come out to unity
undesirables now you gotta hold these
drunky God all right to do everything
for you okay Paulie here's your fucking
tutorial imma teach you how to make
balloon San Antonio I don't even know
what I'm sayin
make that make lick a weird vag don't
act like you're not learning and then
twist it don't be afraid okay I'm very
afraid balloons just manhandle the fuck
out of this balloon now here's like your
poodles face so you're going to push the
Pluto head back behind the poodle
narrative oh my god Oh
he's all hot oh my fucking god
after you twist that like eight hundred
fucking times that's what this whole art
consists uh it's just twists in things
until you're pleased with it which seems
racist if you ask me big little little
big then you're gonna take your anal
beads girl get poodle just twist it just
force it close your eyes and beliefs
that's not right and if there's kids
waiting for you while you're doing this
just be like shhh your parents aren't
paying me enough to be here it's very
fucking bad looks like we use most of
our balloon real estate for this
hairpiece which in my opinion it's
totally worth it because I just hand
this to them because they're like three
years old they're like holy shit you're
fucking in the vision I'm like a bitch
fucking pay me God so this was a fucking
one balloon balloon animal and you're
like weeks Austria and I'm like oh dude

at this children's birthday party is be
like hey kids don't turn out like me
