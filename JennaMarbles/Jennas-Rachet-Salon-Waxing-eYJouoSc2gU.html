traveling and if you're watching this
I'm currently traveling because I
appreciate all your comments and stuff
from last week that you understand this
month is very very busy for me and I'm
kind of a homebody I don't do well when
I'm like traveling a lot so I'm sorry
for not providing you with the most
groundbreaking shit over here but I'm
kind of like freaking out a little huh I
did this with Tyler Oakley and I waxed
his legs but I wanted to do this with
somebody that I could really actually
hurt ever since I saw like Jesse and
Jeana do it like five fucking years ago
I know I just did a generation salon but
I'm like I love doing Jenna's rachet
salon because I think it's just my
calling in life to like make people
really really good-looking I just know
what the fuck I'm doing and if ever we
needed another example of why Julian is
the best sport in the world I think that
this takes the cake for that last time
which gave you like nice little
under-eye mass and this time I wanted to
like give you a nice little relaxing spa
experience I'm relaxed Julian have you
ever gotten anything waxed for flight no
I have not nothing why not
not even like your mustache have you
ever had the desire to get something
laughs never there was this one time
nope never
don't do what Gina did like you got a
fucking pull that thing I'm gonna pull
it off hi Gina hi Jesse hey guys can we
just do this already
oh we've already more wax yeah I kiss on
my afternoon no Derek German ratchet
salons will now add in waxing to cater
to our area clients Wow oh oh that
really worked well extreme closeup of
the drill in
a huge mistake if we can attach these to
you oh my god
put that away for me please fucking
mother
yeah you are see I'm telling you and if
you went swimming you're gonna be like
so much faster on to your legs are
really pretty look I got some new scab
in there that's horrifying
get it away from my face it's not you
maybe do it better and get all the hairs
lazy the first time I've seen your legs
yourself I've seen my leg skin like too
much hair so it doesn't this might be
hurting me either a little bit you're
missing like splotches on I'm not
missing it your hair is refusing you do
it again you just did that spot we can
do your bikini line after this oh my god
you can use a little bit it hot
konishi were like bleeding a little bit
the ankle is sensitive gs5 your hair
looks good because is their friend it
was not me it refuses to
it's hypoallergenic but you're getting
lots of irritation okay all right don't
touch it no likes feel it caresses so
weird I feel like I'm touching her leg
and then my leg no we didn't agree a
foot I didn't say anything about foot
Garrett Jones magical wands if you get
an app like wax we'll do you foot for
free nice clean foot in three two one
is every single hair getting way too old
okay can we do you toes no fucking god
no your hair looks great
I wasn't even bad you can't make that
decision look at how much hair was on
your toe so press for now if you think I
should wax Juli exactly on please don't
perform oh my fucking leg feels
crossword and sticky Melissa joke and
then I'll rip off the wax why I figured
if I slapped you then it would draw
attention away such bad logic stop it
Titanic sank 103 years ago making it the
only thing your mom didn't go down on
