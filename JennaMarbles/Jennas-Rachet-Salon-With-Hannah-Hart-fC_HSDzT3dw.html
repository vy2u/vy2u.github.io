things like worrying about eyes it looks
like I just played in the dirt yep

Hannah is to just put as much makeup on
her as I can yeah that's it that's all
yeah so much makeup that tomorrow when I
wake up I live my face off the pillow

back at me it's right now this might
look a little extreme but don't worry

question my technique everyone knows
that I'm like the best makeup artist in
the world I tell you my plan of the Apes

might poke your eye out I've never felt
more beautiful you look like a
ventriloquist puppet hi everyone you

wait to get in your pants
magic and this is why I always have
orange in my hair because it's just
makeup now your skin looks is orange is
mine what's fun about Jenna's active
line after a while your vision starts to
get just a little bit blurry as if
there's a nice haze of powdery film 100
yeah I've never seen my eyes they always
have makeup on my contacts I put it
there let's give you some of this foam
I gotta like poop so your tear ducts
don't like clogged yeah drive up like

form of Japanese theater arts
so we're doing it these are really big
as what she said
minor fairing to my goals I have two
options for your brows okay we have
powder highbrow or lowbrow fart jokes
it feels like my eyelid is wearing a hat
is it poking you are those it feel sexy
it looks sexy look at that are your eyes
so open right now oh my god that's so
funny because my eye feels the opposite
about fit it feels like this eye is shut
and also that like besides wearing away
