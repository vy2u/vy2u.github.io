Jenna's ratchet salon
welcome back again to Jenna's ratchet
salon I have done one of these with
Hannah Hart and I've also done other
people's makeup one of the most
requested videos since I started dating
Julian was to do Julian's makeup because
he's just beautiful as it is oh I'm
dying to see what you look like with a
full face makeup on because I think you
just have really nice like brows and
lashes obviously I'm the most gifted
makeup artist and all in all the land
I mean classically trained makeup artist
is anything can you be classically
trained Cup and I can't even lie like
we've been having a hell of a week we're
moving but we found a place to live this
could be the last video that we're ever
gonna make in this house and I'm not
even mad about it for you I need a man
oh I didn't want to just give Jillian a
whatever face I drew inspiration from
Kim Kardashian huh I really want to give
Julian a bronzy smokey glowy eye with a
nude lip and then you know maybe you
need a center part if you want goofin
can you boyfriend it to you go oh hey
you ready yeah okay I take makeup Inc
very seriously
it's how I fooled the entire Internet
into thinking that I'm a mildly okay
looking girl if you think I'm okay
looking just watch out of Julian's blogs
you'll see the real Jenna she shines on
Julian's channel the important part of
makeup is every part in the foundation
is just as important as the other parts
good thoughts hope you're looking nice
and orange so this makes you look like
you're really hungry okay I suppose it
makes you look like you eat dry clothes
with air
be sure to bagel with the garbage see
this is the secret to Kim's look and you
have to be naked okay oh I like it
alright you're looking beautiful I'm
ready thank you how does that make you
feel
makes me feel like an alien because I
can murder did my eyes go feel really
lucky to get my makeup done by you

though your teeth look super white
that's a trick the orange trade you're
welcome from one of Olympus are they try
just like gab it like stab it with your
finger okay we're good leave it off RL
I'm terrified and I look terrified
reviewing a clam powder like this like
look hungry
does this feel mirror on your beard if
you were to brush sandpaper except this
ham careful with your face soft
candlelight glow of glowy not to be
confused with Khloe Kardashian oh he's
my favorite one she's the big one right
he keeps it she keeps it so real feel
like I'm in nirvana
