were saying that it just gets everywhere
I apologize in advance I'm really sorry

salon so that's what we're gonna do
I could just bathe them and you know cut
their nails but that's boring with the
ones that not me
I want to watch my dog straight into
different colors so I have blue green
and white and some pink nail polish for
the goalie oh I think I'm gonna try and
just spray-paint them solid colors to
begin with and then maybe see how crazy
