friends
so yesterday I just got back from New
York City I was at Madame Tussauds I got
made into a wax figure for those of you
that follow me on Twitter Instagram you
saw the pictures I'm sure they were
crazy because she looks just like me
except like the best version of myself
my makeup has never looked that good but
I'm a little tired coming down from it
it was an incredible honor thank you
madame tussauds and if you're ever in
New York City and you go to that wax
museum you can meet the wax me and she
takes a selfie for you and then we'll
send it like to your phone for what you
want and it is the coolest thing in the
entire world right after I got home from
New York I realized that I am going to
Tokyo
on November like 15 18th with something
somewhere in there bring YouTube FanFest
I've traveled to a lot of places in the
past so most of which a language barrier
has not really been an issue I took like
eight years of Spanish and I also took
one year abruption do not know any like
conversational Japanese like how to
order food in a restaurant I figured
that this was something I was gonna do
anyways but why not do it with you
together I do not have eight years to
learn Japanese like I did was Spanish I
need to do this as quickly as possible
and sometimes if you go to Japan and
spoke broken Japanese it's better than
no Japanese video might not be for you
it might not be for anyone but I mean
it's for me you might want to get in
here because you're gonna be in Japan
too so the only thing in Japanese that I
currently know how to speak is head
shoulders knees and toes the song which
is not going to help us in any way
so when they ask for your passport just
say that I thought like that thing with
it I hate myself
