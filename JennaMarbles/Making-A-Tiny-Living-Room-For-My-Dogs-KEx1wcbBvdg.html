of explaining myself so you know what
I'm just going to cut to the chase so
much we need a picture
at me of some lady turning there under
the stairs area into a tiny Chihuahua
bedroom and I said I want one of those I
just so happen to have one of those
faces this is what it looks like
actually Ryan Higa and all of his
friends and I we've all fit in there
together right this isn't my house we
rent it so like we can't like renovate
this into a really cool dog hangout area
which is my dream but I can like fuck it
up a little and a little bit so I'm
going to make this into a chill dog
living room because I'm gonna dolt
I mean we were using this for like
storage like just random storage but I
think it'd be way better suited to be
like a cool dog living room and like
when my niece comes over she can like
hang out over here because it'd be cool
for kids too
I'll have any kids I just have dogs in
case you couldn't tell by how ridiculous
my channel so I went to Target and I
bought you know what I could find in
terms of like smallish furniture and
things to make a look like a living room
and it didn't really do a good job of
like measuring the dimension so fuck it
we're just going to try and see what
happens
well my plan is to fix the ambience
because it's dark and dank in there and
you know put something on the floor put
something on the ceiling some nice light
from some little dog furniture so they
can chill in there and I think we're
going to change so if you ever wanted to
watch like a home renovation show for
someone turning their like harry potter
cabinet into a dog cabinet this is for
you
I don't haven't seen the dream corner
that I did in the office guys pretty
much just stapled in or nailed blankets
and towels but I like it's fun and it
makes it fun and nice so I ran out of
extra blankets and towels so I literally
got these like kids
canap√© thing and I'm thinking like
that's going to make it even easier than
blankets in house I'm just going to try
and nail into the fucking stairs I guess
and cover the wall so I think I'm going
to do that first before we put anything
in there fuck
pray for me okay Kevin change I just
like the whole stair come down huh I
caught my eyes looks like I don't even
let me fool you I'm using this for me I
don't think it's going to cover like
everything like I put it here I think it
would just make it weird
so we're just going to cover the walls I
can't really do this feeling probably
not possible but this far it's cool I
mean that's better than nothing right I
mean I think it's pretty cute already
right it's pretty cute so they're going
to do lights now I just finished the
life do you want to come in here and
love day I mean it's already pretty sick
so I'm excited right like that's what
thousand times better I'm no longer
scared to be in here for my life though
so I got this rug for in here this is
actually like if I break down this whole
space this is such a worthy buy because
it's like a cushion fake little
sheepskin rug for the dog look at that
now my knees don't hurt as much well
just you know cover up this said exactly
but you know give me a break it's a tiny
dog room so the next thing I'm going to
put in here is this tiny dog dresser ah
it's a nightstand but you know they're
going to need somewhere to keep their
belongings Wow thank you so you're that
guys we're going to put all your clothes
in there and stuff perfect nailed it
so this walls big open space but luckily
I got this adorable memo board for them
to put all of them
zon that come with any nail course it
didn't I also got these adorable hooks
because they're going to need somewhere
to put like their leashes and Kermit's
got to put his nervous collars somewhere
so I never need to hang stuff I'm gonna
put both these things up I'll be back
so the memo board is up I think it looks
lovely I don't think we have any memos
to go in there but we'll see the nice
little hooks are up for them to put
their leashes and we got them this
beautiful board so if you can no no here
is are allowed in here I'm sweating all
that's left is to add the furniture and
the things in here to make it pretty so
I'm going to do that and there is I'll
show you the reveal like a true home may
go tiny houses what's there seeing music
I don't know play that and imagine it
and then I'll see you for the reveal
