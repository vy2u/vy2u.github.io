five-year anniversary happy anniversary
this video was super requested last
summer like non-stop when romp hymns
were a big thing and it's super hot out
right now and I just want to do
something nice for my out for our five
year anniversary so I'm gonna make you
again I'm gonna make you a beautiful
elegant Rob him when I was looking
online at pictures of romp hims they're
all like the same shape and everything
about them is the same it's like a
button-down shirt with like built-in
shorts that's a one-piece it's so boring
like I don't understand who says a man
can't enjoy a beautiful flowy fabric in
a flowy shape that allows you to enjoy
the warm weather with freedom who says
that nobody so I want to make Julian a
really nice flowy romper so I took him
to the fabric store and I had him pick
out fabric and this is what he chose
I'll do the chroma key poster now an
invisible okay
they've lemonade here
Trask I think something like this looks
like a flower this is a fantasy this one
is my guy no this would be hot I sweat
all over it this reminds me of Beauty
and the Beast this is actually really
nice I think that is really pretty on
you I'm feeling I'm feeling the fabric
give it to me give it to me you're
pissing the stalks off I just existing
I'm trying to figure out in my mind if
this is big enough because I kind of
just want to make two pieces and slap
them together I've made a couple of
sewing videos in the past I'm not like
good at sewing like please don't take
any instruction for me unless you want
to make stuff that's not quite right
like me I don't know how to sew I just
refuse to fail okay this is the very
professional way how to do stuff the
best way to do this is to get your man
to just lay down on this where my feet
are late stop happy anniversary
wait like here but in the middle because
I'm gonna fabric - hey guys welcome to
my tracing tutorial you lift your arm up
H I guess I'll just cut out two pieces
of that and then we'll go from there
let's do it cut up get up
that's really not that even is it did
you ever have to take home act like Home
Economics home AK ya know to be fair
like it wasn't just a girl thing it was
like everybody thing here like on thin
ice with me already
nice core - yup - okay I see that that's
cute what's your favorite part of
having having an anniversary today me
too
if you don't wear this I'm gonna be
genuinely offended what's your favorite
part of scissors where's the handle cuz
it's safe what they're all this shit off
the table I got a so made it out of why
err no what's your favorite letter in
the word anniversary mine then the first
one not the second one second ones
they're just be redundant you know have
you happy anniversary
Jenna what you light up my wife don't do
that
down to there I mean what's your part of
the Shh all right are you ready to try
this on so I can make some alterations
yes B and cut it more it doesn't have a
zipper oh wait you can't put it on cuz
it doesn't have a zipper whoops I sewed
it all together but I forgot that once
you do that Julianne can't get in it so
I'll just try and figure out a place
that seems relatively central and hope
that that that's where it should go cuz
I fucked up zipper foot I don't have a
zipper foot I'm just gonna sew it I
guess I don't even really know how to
put in a zipper please don't yell at me
in the comments I really don't know how
to sew I'm just doing my best
yes do you know the zipper is the
largest organ in the body and it has the
most teeth and bones and if you find a
zipper in the wild if it might be
poisonous or what if before I put the
zipper in you try it now that I've cut
it open it might be a little tight okay
yeah you want it tight I prefer to oh
boy well the back is pretty messed up
because I just cut it down on it you
just stabbed me no I didn't yeah I'm
just feeding it I was stabbed I feel
like this is the wrong way to do this
upper I feel defeated and
don't feel defeated you can do this okay
what do you want you want the shorts
shorter what do you mean there's a lot
of space I like it it's you want to be
like up more do I maintain my shape you
do a fun activity okay you can cut all
this excess everything outside of the
stitch cut off so right down the middle
yes and then cut your shorts how you
like them I've never done this before
I'm very nervous what do you think she
would do if I just cut right down the
middle of the whole thing do you think
she would like uh nanniversary today I
accidently cut a hole in it I have a new
plan what is it I'm gonna cut off the
whole top and we're gonna make overalls
I just like it I hate it I hate it and I
can't fucking so that zipper in so I'm
just gonna cut like where the armhole is
across and then give you straps bold
daring I say so no greatness was ever
achieved without risk or incredible
error so now I've eliminated the need
for a zipper what why you laughing I'm
good
what do you provocative it makes you
like an ass memo for your ass you want
some thick straps right for support
thick with four and a half C's I'm not
gonna finish any of the edges that's way
too much work no I like the rugged look
you know I wanted to be flowy flowy and
blowy so I'm going to attach this and
then I'll cut a hole in that one and you
can attach your button with it Oh how'd
it go like there so give you some
coverage up here titty coverage what is
this where is this scarf okay only gonna
romp in ten get out
I don't know if you've noticed but the
Sun has literally gone down like this is
taking me far longer than I had
anticipated nothing beautiful ever
happened overnight well actually there's
probably a lot of things but this this
is beautiful and it's happening
it's taking very long inspiring I'm
gonna write that on the right over so
you don't hit your face into my face
that makes like a really oughta bleep
disgusting sound horribly disgusting
band and calls it anniversaries be like
needle and the thread gotta get you the
back is exquisite don't boot my nipple
you stab me like I don't know how to sew
buttons that looks right mmm this is a
heavy button for like a stretch fabric T
welcome first don't I already know the
surprise is your nipple we start from
the back this time to a girl who learns
their lesson stop don't burp in my face
like a dog what would you do if I burped
on your head what are you laughing about
now that's what I call a rump in beach
do they look like they're both peon yes
all right Beach Rob him tour can you
show us the back look at that exquisite
workmanship it actually looks so cute
from the back how do you feel I feel
like you you look like you're feeling
yourself I'm kind of feeling myself
honestly if we if this were like during
the day I'd be running outside amongst
the flowers and grass and trees because
I am sunshine when I wear this come to
my workout class this Saturday I'm
holding it at the mall how's the fit the
fits good I like it it's loose cuz
that's what you want right yeah I wanted
to be like flowy and blowy as it blows
in the wind
the front is getting very frumpy yes sir
this is the scale of what this outfit is
this first day of school little boy on
his first day of school Magic Mike and I
could rip no no a little quick tricep
workout I unbutton one oh no offense
this is mine now I can kind of do oh
sorry for that did you see my nipple
like it came out a lot less dumpy I mean
then I thought I was going to know I
just I saw the fabric okay and I felt it
the fabric it was picked prior to there
was a complication but I feel like this
is fitting my form you don't saying will
you put it on backwards for me I'm just
curious okay now we're getting really
avant-garde and I need you to tie it
wait for my vision okay okay we need no
I like you cause if I need to blow my
nose what you had imagined yeah fuck it
oh okay that looks so good show us the
bag mmm you can wear this this romp in
so many ways like a backless halter top
you could fasten it why doesn't H&amp;amp;M just
like make Brahm PIMs that look like that
oh it's cute and functional don't you
feel so much cooler than if you were
wearing something else yes I feel really
cool I want to wear this to the pool to
the gym to the YMCA yeah now I got my
room on my crotch now I feel like a new
man dude I could golf in this you think
any let me on the chorus that
comfortable yeah it's like mad
comfortable it looks so good Oh
oh I've gathered you here today to look
at me because I'm beautiful in this
problem are you gonna wear it forwards
or backwards both I'm gonna name him
vodka because he reminds me of sky-blue
vodka because he's reminds me of the
color blue in the sky
happy anniversary I hope you like your
gift real I like this was really
frustrating cuz I realized that I don't
know how to put in zippers and things
which is fine you just have to be more
creative
then why I don't want to be trapped in a
zipper box don't don't lock me up
ties only prize only I'm genuinely
impressed a man who wears many you're a
man who has many hats and you're a jack
of many trades
except for that hole you caught in there
