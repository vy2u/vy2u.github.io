video has just started a while back I
made a video because my dog Kermit loves
soap and we determined what his favorite
soap was by having him do a little
self-test it was incredibly stupid but
like a lot of people like that video
because Kermit is a weird dog and he's
very charming and we discovered that he
likes Irish Springs so and ever since
that video someone all it takes is one
somebody commented please make a bed of
Irish spring for Kermit out of soap so
you can lay in it and roll around in it
I've wracked my brain I'm trying to
figure out how to do this I'm at the
point where like if you want me to make
a video I'm just gonna make it like okay
what are we doing anyways I haven't made
it yet because I logistically could not
figure out how to do it and second of
all I really think those of you out
there that won't stop commenting this
overestimating Carmen's reaction which I
imagine is gonna be very like mmm okay
that's some soap and then walk away like
I really don't think he's gonna lay down
and roll in it but because this has been
requested so much I've been working
literally all day to try and figure out
how to make this work I need to explain
some things before we start doing this
the I still don't even know what's gonna
work but let me tell you what happened
so we went to the store we bought all
this Irish Spring the problem was so
even if you liquify it and you pour it
into something hard you can't like just
tap it out like it's gonna be stuck in
there so I people use like silicone cake
molds and like silicone form so you can
just pop it out but they don't make
anything in like the shape of a bed look
even the cake molds are like this big so
what am I gonna do fabricate something
out of silicone I don't know how to do
that the mold was the first barrier so
what we came up with was we bought these
litter boxes for cats and I honestly
think
this is the best I'm gonna do okay I'm
gonna be able to fill this with soap and
hopefully shape it to be like a bed
that's it though I'm not gonna be able
to pop it out probably we'll see but I
don't think so the second hurdle is the
problem with Irish Spring soap is that
it's apparently not a melted pour soap
it's like we tried a couple different
ways so this way we put it in the
microwave and it gets like the air
bubbles expand so it sort of expands and
like you can work with it a little bit
but it's nasty and this this is one bar
of soap and it took a while to melt this
the second way to do it is to make
almost like a soap soup where you add a
little water
again this is one bar of soap we cook
this for like over an hour and it got
only that melted so like but maybe two
hours like to take this many bars of
soap and melt it down it's like it's
never gonna happen that you instill when
you melt it with water it like it I
don't know it's like slippery and slimy
like I don't think he's gonna like that
anyways so these are our two options
make a really gross bed out of soap or
make a really slimy bed that's like got
giant chunks in it and they take like
who knows how long to harden so what
I've found out there's a specific type
of soap called melted pour that's made
for like soap making which is a hobby I
went in God finally free tub of said
soap and here's my plan I know you guys
want me to make a bed entirely out of
Irish Spring but as you can see that
ain't gonna fucking happen I'm gonna
take this I'm gonna melt it down I'm
gonna throw a bunch of Irish spring in
my food processor chop it all up and
then like sprinkle the pieces in here so
that it doesn't actually have to get
melted down since this is a different
type of soap than this I can't just
throw it in the microwave or like put it
on a pot and have it melt it doesn't
work trust me I've been doing it all day
it doesn't work it's just gonna be Irish
spring pieces inside of this unscented
like soap that you can actually melt
down yeah I really
that karma is just gonna look at this
and be so underwhelmed and everyone's
gonna be disappointed and we're all
gonna learn a lesson here today which is
the internet is full of good ideas but
they have very mediocre in practice some
of you may be asking themselves Wow oh
oh this is a fun thing oh yeah I feel
thrill go ahead June is their birthday
month all of the dogs have a birthday in
June marbles just had his 10th birthday
yesterday Carmen's birthday is on the
20th peaches is on the 15th peach
honestly just like food Julia made a
video for a couple's birthday that's on
his channel now but like Kermit just
like so so I wanted to do something
special for him for his birthday because
we're probably just gonna feed peach and
Marvel got like a t-shirt and he's very
happy about that
so karma needs something special and
he's a special boy so he deserves it I
can't describe to you how much it smells
like soap in here it's like nauseating
like it almost makes your throat hurt
what cut them all up at once pivot Aries
old dad fuck oh my god it's like
breaking the processor we go come on it
does it feels so cool I didn't really
realize like I knew people did it but I
didn't really realize how many people
like made soap as a hobby it's nice for
soap is 10 out of 10 fun to cut it's
like hard cheese almost for Matt you
better like this bad boy it's your
birthday that I love that dog
I love that dog I love the end or the
reason for some dumb shit
you know I haven't done something this
out-of-control since everyone was like
please fill a bald cap full of eyelashes
and I'm like I don't understand it but
I'll make it let's see what it's just
one person starts it then everyone's
like please make a bed bola by your
spring and here we are I swear to God if
we do all this and I spent so much time
figuring out how to do this with my
brain and karma doesn't like it it's
gonna break me mm-hmm
video when that happens I already failed
last week it given myself beautiful
extensions on my lashes I can't take
another failure I need him to like it
this is what were her key points so far
we can sprinkle this in as we go and see
if we need more Irish spring we're
certainly not gonna run out oh what's
coming out I think oh so this does come
out of something hard maybe we can do
this it's cuz it's not that kind of soap
like if we just melted the Irish spring
it would never come out and be in there
forever it's like so glycerine e you got
the soap coloring too right so we can
try and fool him into thinking it's all
green he's colorful so he's just my lady
I knew too did a minute so let's do that
following directions be like a lot of
the videos you watch didn't have that
much soap in the bowl well no one was
making a bed out of soap no one was ever
making a bed out of soap yeah
milk liquidy enough I mean we're just
throwing a bunch of other soap in it cuz
they need to be completely liquefied
like we could really be tedious about
this the honestly bucket is a bed of
soap for a dog pour in our soap oh
they're just gonna be chunks as Irish
Spring no one can even tell the
difference what what are you seeing what
I'm seeing what have we done
I don't know this it's the best second
come up I want to see what it looks like
after it goes over this layer oh god
this is disgusting and it smells like so
much like Irish Spring look at all the
stuff we've cut we have so much Sun I
love you Carmen less time-consuming
hobby bud that later was nice yeah this
was a nice layer I can't fucking believe
this is like actually happening it's so
weird the internet requested it so I
don't have control over what they asked
me to do this was their fault Julian not
mine
it was there we're doing pretty good
it's taking a very long time it's a lot
of soap in between layers we're putting
it in the fridge to try and help make it
so it doesn't take forever to cool
my back hurts from doing this so
unfortunately we just had a thought what
if we put whole bars of Irish Spring in
here then when we pour the soap it'll
just like encapsulate them and we I'm
trying my best
I swear to god this this soap bed is
gonna be the depth of like a brick oh
yeah let's make a brick pattern we
should've done this from the beginning
why do we bother cutting it up that's
actually don'ts right I know I don't
I shouldn't have to say this but this is
not sponsored at all
but honestly Irish Spring were you at
your my dog's favorite salty I've lost
track of how many bars we've used yeah
me too
Oh Kermit look how much your mom loves
you it actually looks still hi my name
is Jenna I'm 31 now know what I do in my
life all right so my plan is to use this
silicone mold to spell out kermit with
yellow letters of although like arts and
crafts type videos you've done this is
up there with the most fun it's just
really fun to melt soap and then mold it
oh it looks good you think guys it looks
really good I'm sure it's gonna be very
nice wait what that is so cool I have a
problem whoa that did come out good
oh I feel like I'm losing my mind just a
little bit doing this is Snowie snow owl
beach
is that too much it's like a shelf cake
for him the last layer
my arms hurt my back hurts my legs hurts
oh let's let it solidify do you think we
can get it out of here
we can try oh my god it's gonna come out
of here oh oh there we go oh it's coming
oh my god oh my god it worked
all right I don't think that's gonna
work try to work on the perfect tool a
pizza cutter this is so difficult
please don't leave your comments in the
comments that I like you you're dumb
you should have done it this way I will
feel really bad I feel like I'm digging
for treasure this is so stupid it's like
curse of Oak Island we're not gonna find
anything just like hold on this isn't
all like nice and pleasing like those
soap carving videos on YouTube this is
violet this is real light I don't want
to sit in this ain't nobody want to sit
in this this isn't comfortable for samus
or anybody I don't know if you've ever
tried to carve soap before but like this
is probably is smooth so here to get it
in here my arms are exhausted from doing
that but I hope that's like enough of a
little divot for the Internet to agree
that I did in fact make a dog bed out of
Irish Spring I don't think permits gonna
sit
I don't think he's gonna land it but I
think you will smell it it looks so cool
though look at all the layers it's
pretty please come back please come back
please come back oh my god I swear to
God what do you think bye is that your
favorite soap shaped like a bed just for
you
Wow places Kermit would rather roll
around on the carpet Kermit please here
but this is what the internet wanted
hates it hates it Kermie this was 13
hours of work please just it's a soap
bed are you nervous
cuz everyone knows you have a soap
fetish everyone knows it's okay we're
not judging you you know you like soap
it honestly might just be like so much
smell that it's like overwhelming it's
overwhelming to me you know like the
texture Kermie do you like it hates it
so upset I blame this on the Internet
would you smooth this is why when you
guys are like do this do this and I'm
like I don't know man I don't think
that's gonna work out right and you guys
insist let this be the example to
remember this does not work this is a
mess this amount of soap it's probably
just making it more like leave me I want
to leave
it smells so much like soap I feel like
I'm gonna bomb honestly though it's so
beautiful can you imagine if you had
this in your shower like this like you
could just rub on it and then you're
clean yeah I can imagine
slipping on that in the shower and
hurting no can you burn this thing I
don't know what to do with it no either
we've created ourselves quite the pickle
we coated in plastic Kinsella to an art
gallery for $500,000 this is so bad that
I've been sleeping over for hours he
literally doesn't even care to see the
internet thinks that if I made this for
you
that you would lay in it and roll around
in it I don't think that's true
know what babe I think we just kind of
shocked this one up too it's just that
big old big old well you can't say I
didn't do it and that I didn't try I'm
sorry you didn't like your birthday gift
sometimes people get you things since
you just pretend to like them which I
appreciate you doing right now he's like
oh thanks well I hope you enjoyed
watching us at least make this it's very
cool like I think it's really awesome I
like it a lot it just it smells like so
much so that I want to die but this is
what you guys wanted I'm sorry that this
wasn't quite as exciting as you all
thought it was gonna be but let this be
a lesson to you your ideas suck okay I
just feel like we wasted so much time
no it's actually not because we did yeah
