every week to sit and laugh and make fun
of me and he's not here this week and I
just feel so low I've been watching a
lot of DIY videos lately and a long time
ago someone sent me a link that was on
Facebook and it was this this hot glue
video where someone had made flip flops
out of hot glue and I got like
physically angry I got like hot in the
face and was like kind of mad but I know
that these videos are all over Instagram
and Facebook I've never really seen
anybody talk about it about how
absolutely god-awful these are with the
exception of Drew Gooden who has made
one video in the past and actually
released another video today about
Instagram like life hacks I'd say it by
far the ones that sort of like baffle me
the most are the hot glue ones the
things that people will do with a hot
glue gun and call it a hack is just
beyond like I don't know who they are
for who are you helping like some of
them are just like popsicle sticks and
razor blades that you glued together and
made yourself like a prison weapon but I
really wanted to try some of these hot
glue hacks and I'm not gonna do like the
more ridiculous ones where they hot glue
like a bottle cap onto an orange and
squeeze it and make orange juice like I
cannot justify spending my time that way
and this is coming from someone who put
rhinestones all over their entire face
but I am a little curious about some of
the wearables if anyone's gonna actually
sit down and do these crafts it's gonna
be me because I really don't know anyone
else that would watch this and be like
yeah I got some time to kill and some
glue to waste a prerequisite for making
this pair of hot glue shoes is to own a
pair of shoes beforehand to trace why
don't you just wear those perfectly good
looks like parchment paper you just
cover this shit out of it with hot glue
attach like a strap and then you put
another layer on top just somehow negate
the fact that it's filled with holes
what a life heck so I want to try it
because I haven't seen anyone be like I
tried this stuff on five minute crafts I
wasted my time energy money resources
and these are my results so I'm gonna do
that mind you when I was getting
supplies for this video
it cost me almost $100 to get all the
supplies to make the things that I'm
about to make so just keep that in mind
for those of you that are like oh yeah
it's like such an expensive cool way to
like make stuff I'm not sure I agree
with that because a lot of this stuff
that they're DIY it's like sometimes
it's not really stuff you just have like
laying around the house so the whole
name of the channel is five minute
crafts so this takes you longer than
five minutes I call bullshit on that
entire channel so we're not where these
people will be like oh shit girl where
you get those fucking shoes from and
I'll say five minute crafts on YouTube
the channel that scams you into watching
twelve of their videos in a row before
you realize it's all the same fucking
video do you see my hand shaking already
like I'm tired this is exhausting
I honestly like I want to be wrong I
want to believe but so far this just
seems like a tedious slightly dangerous
task and a wasteful one at that like
this takes a lot more glue than I had
anticipated
be one two three four five six it's
probably like six dollars unless you
didn't have parchment paper and maybe
ten dollars I you're in the ten dollar
range this is like you could buy a pair
at Target for ten dollars now so I'm a
little confused as to why the bug you're
spending that kind of money to glue
yourself a pair of shoes that have holes
in the bottom now I'm not gonna use
parchment paper to make the sandal
straps because I'm just gonna do it on
my table because I've stopped giving a
fuck I'm by no means a weak girl I have
strong meaty arms which sometimes look
that ensures I have pretty decent grip
strength and my grip is
sawsan this is exhausting the sun's
literally setting since I started doing
this the sun's also setting on my window
of opportunity for me to do something
with my life like I'm not trying to
stifle anybody's creativity but this is
a fucking waste of time I can't believe
I have to do another layer before this
holy hole pair of shoes is done I think
if I step on anything mildly
three-dimensional it will go into my
foot I think this is like a very loose
definition of shoes they don't protect
your feet from anything what are they
adding to your foot the idea of doing
more hot glue crafts after this is like
making me high V just sort of waiting
for it to be over and these shoes
obviously they'll just inevitably fall
apart and you'll have to hot glue them
back together like if you ever tried to
hot glue part of your shoe back together
it doesn't work let's make a whole shoe
out of that frustrating substance I'm
just settling for blobby blog mess at
this fight because I just don't care I
know it's only been a couple of minutes
for you but for me it has not been okay
it's like lifting the other side oh no
this design is flawed it pulls the shoe
up you know this parts coming apart no -
lets just get these better be the
dankest shoes in the world I mean the
texture and just the general design of
them remind me a lot of like jellies but
I feel like you could find jellies
cheaper than what I just did maybe I
didn't make the strap long enough but
then again it's not like they showed you
how to do it so see the problem is is
that they don't really stick together
because there's so many holes in them
okay you know they're not structurally
sound anywhere but now they have
completed then I guess I am a little bit
proud it's kind of cool but is it is it
though I just don't chant these on my
feet oh okay see it just sort of like
let me get up and I'll show you
at first when I put them on they felt
kind of good I was like oh that's a
little squishy after a couple seconds it
physically starts to hurt it feels like
you're standing on
softish Legos look if I take one step
they sort of just flop all over they are
not shoes at all this is not okay this
doesn't feel good and they don't work
like if I were to actually walk they
just slip off my feet see that what the
hell is going on I will never get this
part of my life back I knew they looked
ridiculous on the internet cuz guess
what they are this doesn't work
these have been an exhausting failure I
am gonna move on to the next crap which
is slightly less involved but before I
do that let me just give you an idea
what else is on this channel first of
all this person just made a tiny little
bikini for their iPhone whose underwear
slips over the home button so you can no
longer use it but this is probably one
of my favorite crafts you just take a
tampon okay and you glue it to the top
of a jar and spray-paint it oh it's it's
for your rings they have 12 minutes I'm
not trying to shit on on their channel
or their creativity but you know what
some of it feels like you're gonna pull
a muscle from reaching so this next one
got me pretty hyped up individually
cutting out wait for it a set of hot
glue fake nails which I will not be
coloring in okay so what they just did
just now with take a small little
adhesive that usually you'd get like in
a set of other press-on nails or you
could buy individually probably but the
moral of the story is so you came so far
as to get nail adhesive look at any
nails to glue them with you're gonna
make the nails I like glue and gloom I
mean it okay I'm pumped I can't wait to
do it lucky for me I can repurpose my
shoe forms for what looks like he made a
blob in here like I'm just trying to
understand like who some of these crafts
are for someone that has nail adhesive
stick
hot glue gun in tons of glue but like no
fake nails it's certainly not for a kid
this is way too much hot glue gun
activity for a child a grown woman like
me apparently
I see all these hack videos and I've
never seen anyone be like oh my god
thanks this is so great I made that I
think people just like like idea porn
even if they're bad that's five
beautiful hot glue nails okay this is
kind of nice to cut I do kind of like
this like solid glue piece and then you
cut it that feels kind of good like ass
imagine if you went to a nail salon and
you're like yeah it's like I thought a
glue nails please coming right up bitch
you give me a minute I'll color I'm into
here is the closest adhesive that I have
which is a little bit of lash glue doing
it to try it I don't want them there's
hot glue dripping everywhere just like
every second that you have the hot glue
gun on it wastes itself why oh it's a
bloodbath
although the flat texture of the glue
does feel nice and fun this is not the
shape of a nail your nail isn't flat
this is my life hack at all this is
again a waste of time and hot glue and
lash glue hey I want to say hell yeah I
love making something hot glue I'm just
no you can't do this no gay no this is
not right it's wrong this is not a
solution to any problem this is a mess
so far mo for - I'm never gonna get this
time back ma this is what happens when
we blind we watch videos and no one
actually tries them this is a sham
although this next hot glue heck is not
necessarily a wearable I honestly could
not help myself because I want to try it
all right so you take a glove I think I
might use one like this a little softer
and then oh oh oh yeah oh okay
I don't have
hat obviously but I do have a marbles so
it seems like you just put balls of hot
glue all over the place
okay the one thing I will say is that
the hot glue is getting all over the
rest of the gloves well you can't really
make like clean dots with a hot glue gun
we all know that I just hope none of
these just like break off and get into
his fur it's kind of a blob Club see if
you like it some of his fur is coming
out I mean he sheds a little but like
not a ton does it feel good what do you
think it's kind of hard to tell
Kermit do you want the glove to do you
want to try you like that you like that
you don't care you can't tell if that's
my hand or what Oh does that feel good I
will say that maybe you put some smaller
dots on here it might work on like a cat
but like some of them are already coming
off and it's not half of the appeal of
like a pet club it's like you could wash
it or like get some of the hair out like
if you put this in any kind of water all
this hot glue is gonna come off girl and
you know it if you need to brush your
cat right now and all you have is a
latex glove and a hot glue gun
sure so far this is probably the most
realistic craft so this next one going
back to our wearable crafts looks like a
lot of the other ones where it's like a
bracelet or like some earrings where you
basically just diarrhea some hot glue
onto construction paper or like litter
it with rhinestones or something and
make jewelry out of person needs a
stencil to draw a heart here's where I
get a little lost because if this is
really just like I'm at home with my
glue gun and I want to make something
would you really have like a necklace
ring at your disposal this is part of
the reason why the cost of the materials
although a lot of it was glue this is it
super duper cheap it's not like 30
seconds 30 cents like I don't have this
so more just melting glue see then she
just pulls out a chain out of nowhere
like if you have all that and you come
that far like to put anything on there
you chose to put hot glue on
construction paper I want to try it I
want to see if it's cute this was a
couple dollars and they really
dollar 30 and then these two together to
buy this is the smallest amount of these
I could find along with a chain this is
like a ten dollar necklace which you
could just buy at the register of a
craft store but let's fucking do it
beautiful the paper just like theirs
because I don't care about the rest of
this paper I'm not gonna use it for
anything I just bought this whole sheet
of construction paper cut out of that
sighs heart rate in the fucking middle
anyways jam a little on there it burned
me it doesn't look great but you know
what we'll work with it so now you just
do to dump dump all over your heart with
this hot glue I will say this is a five
minute craft not acquiring the materials
but the executing looks like it's worth
every penny this took a hot second to
dry because it's just like crafting with
molten lava just like there's there is a
little spot at the top that it's
difficult to cut out which is a dead
giveaway that this is a piece of paper
and hot glue so the bottom of it feels
very sharp because this is a sharp piece
of paper I feel like if you were wearing
it with like you know a low top this
would it would hurt so now let me open
my five dollar chain I love my money I
love just taking it dumping it in the
toilet
tell me what the results are ladies and
gentlemen it's that beautiful master
pass there's no one here this man should
pass on me so I'm gonna need you to just
tell me if it looks nice this is the
final heart pendant I mean it's not the
worst thing in the world but it's
definitely like look at that when it
turns around oh god it's like you could
spray paint a noodle metallic purple is
this worth ten dollars this isn't even
worth ten dollars
I will pay someone $10 to rip this off
me
the thought is there but like maybe it
came apart it already ripped off and you
know I jammed that bitch in here you
could wear this for maybe 15 minutes
before this inevitably broke
I feel had by that YouTube channel yeah
could i hot glue this back together sure
it's not even worth the glue at this
point again yeah pieces of glue are cool
and fun to touch but like not for ten
dollars men not for ten dollars we've
come to the very last thing that I have
the patience to make right now and it is
by far along with the shoes one of the
like more popular hot glue hack crafts
that I've seen I mean I'm not looking
forward to it after those but I feel
like I have to do it so this is what I'm
talking about
oh my all right like my my arm is tired
from the shoes this is so extra
somebody's gotta try it okay and I'm
gonna try it we're gonna make a hot glue
hat I mean I miss my boyfriend and
everything but like this is kind of an
extreme solo activity you know how you
supposed to know how big your head is I
feel like the Hat could be better
because the shoes like need to function
as shoes but like as long as the Hat
goes on top of your head it's
accomplished its existence as a hat ya
know yeah just go through all the
parchment paper put it in my tab
five drafts they said I'm not gonna give
up
I'm gonna plan B and I'm just gonna get
Bowl this should be fine right don't
even care anymore
uneven imagine doing this all fucking
balloon I'm glad it didn't work I have
no idea how I'm gonna get this off like
you know I didn't how your layers and
like you start to lose your mind and you
can tell them losing my mind
I'm like I'm getting there it's pretty
pinchy bell elegant again in case you
couldn't tell this is not a five-minute
craft I feel like a good roll with hot
glue is like just because you can make
it doesn't mean that you should that's
basically what that whole channel is
yeah here are you because I feel like
everyone else knows that you shouldn't
do it but for some reason I need to try
it I'm gonna try and get this off I
don't really my hat cuz I'm really
pissed I'm ripping apart a lot of it
this does not work this does not work
this doesn't work okay it's ripping and
I don't want anyone in the comments
really don't know you shouldn't cover
your mouth clean it's a hot glue head
you know what something it would have
been particularly easier on a balloon
let me have my stupid hat oh my god I
did it I got it I got it
this looks like shit I don't want to
hear anyone judging me okay I'm trying
my best here let's just make it a brim
and call it a day
we're gonna be ahead I swear it to God
to like I'm trying my best I'm not like
trying to fuck this up this is genuinely
difficult just let's rip it off it's
what it is I knew this is gonna be
terrible and you know what it came out
even worse than I thought
good does it look like tears and sadness
wow what a hat have you ever put glue on
your hair it doesn't feel good I feel
like my hair is breaking just being
under it is it a hat I don't know by
definition it's a hat this was not worth
the time
energy I spent doing it not at all not
even in the least
in fact I'm mad at myself I can't
believe I've done this what do you think
that's what you wanted five minute craps
you want who me to look like this it
doesn't feel right it doesn't look right
this is a glue hat this is time that I
have genuinely wasted in my life
genuinely genuinely weights it just like
all the hours I spent watching these
videos this is a waste of that this is
glue no matter what you do with it this
is glue okay it's not a hat it's not
shoes it's not a necklace this is glue
glue is glue I hope trillion never
leaves me again I really can't handle
another time like this this is a dark
time when you miss your port so you try
to fill your heart with hot glue
watching these videos like you know
they're kind of terrible yeah some of
them look like okay maybe that's okay
but 90% of them it's just like what the
fuck okay and I'm here to confirm that
I've never seen anyone actually make the
glue hat or the glue shoes from those
videos and I did it and I'm here to tell
you it is not worth it time energy money
or glue this is a waste of blue this is
a waste of time
I feel sad on the inside I don't like it
I literally just made these I can no
longer wear my glue nails are my glue
necklace they have broken and fallen
apart
I can wear my glue shoes in my glue hat
but like am i wearing them are they
wearing me could you make an entire
shirt out of hot glue shirt fuck it why
don't you just make a car out of hot
glue I don't know like at what point are
you like maybe I shouldn't make that out
of hot glue I'm here to call you out and
say these are not life hacks that look
like someone whose life is better after
I've done this I feel worse than ever I
should have just taken my actual
physical dollar bills and thrown them in
the trash cuz that's where I just put
them there's literally so many other
tear
life hacks so let you know if you'd like
me to test any of them because it's all
fun and games when you see a little
montage of them but you know what they
don't work and it pisses me off this is
a lie maybe I'll go to the beach like
this yeah there's a lady covered in glue
at the beach and she won't get out
that's it hey I'm like Elsa from frozen
hot glue lady instead of like frozen
power chips hot glue powers could you
build yourself a glue castle and it's
covered in glue outfit that's me right
now it's not funny anymore
make sure you subscribe to my channel I
put a new voice a slash Thursday Julian
this is what happens when you leave
you can't leave you have to stay here
for me I'll see you guys next week

ripping my hair up it's taken not only
my soul but my hair does it look better
