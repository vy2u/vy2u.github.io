Twitter and Instagram you probably know
that Julian was getting a puppy this
past weekend and I'm dying to show you
her and it's very exciting she's an
Italian Greyhound just like Kermit so
without further ado I'm gonna show you
the baby she's very sleepy tired this is
peach this is Julian's baby girl and I'm
gonna show you some clips of her from
when we got her and her first couple
days here she's a wily little baby she's
like teething so she bites a lot and for
those of you that don't like vlogs or
stuff about my real life I'm just fuckin
bi this is why I haven't really been on
the Internet the last few days because
this little one is taking up an awful
lot of time and energy aren't you her
teeth are like little fucking razors you
know who did you look kids very much
this is the baby and this is Kermit
so Kermit like he really likes her like
there they play a lot outside together
it's like the weirdest thing in the
world to watch your baby have a baby if
that makes any sense like he's just so
patient with her like he's always been
the baby he's always been the needy like
little one and then he's just so sweet
and patient with her but this one I like
the baby I tolerate her but that's about
it
him and Carmen are like best friends for
life and they do everything together I
think eventually when she gets out of
her face where she's just biting
everything that marbles might like her a
little more
take it easy down there she's teething
like a cuts on me everywhere cuz she's
just she'll jump and like attack you and
bite you she was like biting his tail
and like his butt and like he's gotten
to the point where he'll let her do it
for a little while and then if she like
steps on his eyes and stuff then he'll
then he'll growl it but you've been very
patient and you need extra attention
because you're super third wheel now huh
but I want to show you some clips of her
from the first few days because she's
completely adorable I just wanted to
show you the baby so from now on when
