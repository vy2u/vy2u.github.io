something that's not particularly new or
inspired but it has been requested a
bunch and I know that people have been
missing this particular special guest on
my channel and sidebar if my eye looks a
little crazy I slept in my contacts the
other night and I am still dearly paying
the consequences for it

would get LASIK eye surgery if it didn't
look like the most terrifying thing ever
invented I really would like her to give
me a new look you know I kind of always
look the same and I wanted her expertise
I would like everyone just it's just me

but I have a channel subscribe it's not
a comedy channel so I don't know why
this comedians laughing yeah you date
Harry Styles don't you yeah he doesn't
talk about it too much but we're pretty
serious made a whole video about it
subscribe how did you get into makeup
did you go to cosmetology school or
anything um I was just like really
really good as a kid and as an adult at
everything so basically I had to pick
anything cuz I was good at everything
and I just picked makeup because I don't
ever need any and I'm not even wearing
any makeup so you're you're wearing a
little lipstick and um no no knowing any
makeup are we alive well then why are
you like doing makeup if you're not
wearing any makeup because they're like
making other people look as good as I do
or try I can't make any promises
just like your poor skin my time is
really precious like I have poor skin
your skin is poor it asked me for money
on the way in there are we gonna do
go ahead okay I guess we'll start with
some David Beckham foundation so we'll
just like dabble along on each side so
when you're doing a makeup normally
you're gonna be doing it to yourself so
you won't have a person who's being
difficult
am I being difficult yeah you're like
moving I'm not trying to move your skin
just ask me for money again
these are the best tools you can ever
use you can train yourself you don't
need tools although I will be using a
lot of tools okay we're done with the
foundation I don't feel like you got it
everywhere
okay fine I'll use one of your crappy
tools to fix it so we can cover every
inch of her skin can you do me a favor
while I do this shut your mouth
oh that's so pretty subscribe to me in
my mouth yeah so the first time
something is in your mouth today let's
make your forehead brighter than your
future won't be that hard can you look
at me thank you
working with a muppet we're gonna do a
little bit of blush otherwise known as
how Jenna feels every time she goes
anywhere
I feel like blush yeah cuz you're
embarrassing so you blush your bears
yourself just from being you how do you
out then so I'm just gonna pop it on the
cheap like that and if your face is
being really difficult and not taking
just really be violent
champagne is my spirit animal they
didn't have one that said mock is my
spirit animals I just bought this one
with Harry's credit card yeah we're
gonna contour cuz when you Eli
cheeseburgers you need to contour your
face and make it look like you don't eat
a lot of cheeseburger he's going me fast
just look at me I need a contour we
don't have a lot of time like you do to
eat so I'm just gonna lay it out like in
a straight line under her cheekbone
which I can't find looks so good today

myself you teeth are weird shut up

so now that the bronzing is done we're
done with the brown things so I got some
eyeshadow that I really like it's from
Beckham's line it's called herbal BK and
I'm just gonna use it with this brush
made of real Greek children that's a
Greek children yeah you gotta get the
best stuff sacrifices need to be made
somewhere and I'm not gonna make them
okay so we're just gonna cover her
eyelid like this was a blast yeah it's
like really black is there a reason why
black because black eyeshadow matters
