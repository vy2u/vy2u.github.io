said it not you fuck you can't a girl
just channel their inner Rihanna I
mentioned in previous video that
sometimes I don't always do my makeup in
a way that will give you a boner today
is one of those days
a while ago I made a video called things
I don't have time for and I think a good
alternate title for that video is just
great moments in Jenna's laziness and I
have some more that I wanted to include
in another video because my laziness
knows no bounds can't say that for all
of these ain't nobody got time because
funny people do have time I just don't
have fucking time I have all the time in
the world
for trying to look like Rihanna like I
just did fuck out of my face but for
these things I do not have time so
without further ado here are more things
that I don't have time for the first
thing I don't have time for is to shower
every day and for those of you that
think that's gross you can go ahead and
fuck yourself we got home from Vegas
recently and our friend Brett who's
watching the dogs and we got home really
Katy dog so it's good and Brett's like
okay I'll go cuz I'm sure you guys want
to shower and stuff and I just started
dying laughing and I'm like you know
what I don't want to do it all is take a
fucking shower you want to know why
because I'm a fucking girl and that's
not relaxing to me it's never been a
relaxing thing ever because I have so
much work to do in there in order to
take a shower I'm even like fucking
caffeinate I need to mentally prepare
myself for like an hour for all the
things that I need to do in that fucking
shower because it's just it's literally
work it's a lot of work it's exhausting
I'm like sweating when I get out of the
shower cuz I just had to like shampoo my
hair seven hundred times and you
shada reach my body it's fucking it's
hard work the struggle is real
here's a positive note I save a ton of
water because I care about the
environment that's why I'm not taking a
shower because I care I care so much
about the environment I'm clean I feel
like your body gets used to not being
fucking watched constantly science I
don't know read a fucking book or some
shit I don't have time to shower every
day the next thing that I don't have
time for is meal prep sundays or any of
the other bullshit that health and
fitness people on instagram tell you
that you have no excuses for now this
does not I repeat this does not apply to
everyone that's in health and fitness on
Instagram okay a lot of people are
totally fine and positive and happy and
motivating but there are some fucking
people on there it seems to think that
they're getting sick from fucking God to
help the rest of us work out and shit
first of all you're telling me that on
Saturday
you eat six day-old chicken on the most
fun day of the week that's fucking
disgusting
Saturday night time to fucking eat this
old ask me for it turn up in the club by
club I mean gym with my ax broccoli
farts the only people that are
successful doing that long term we're
hipsters in their previous life hit run
run run run run got a little meal they
get off and they take a selfie with
their pellets and their food and like
take little nibbles of water from a
water bottle on the wall and then they
fucking like meal prep sundaes that's
the only logical explanation
to my mind I think most of us the goal
is to find a balance in our lives I
think if I got a fucking paycheck for
looking like a buff ass she beast I'm
pretty sure I would have minimal excuses
to not do part of my job like you my
friend but because I'm a regular person
actually a plenty of fucking excuses
lawn order marathon my geographical
proximity to Wendy's I don't know I felt
like taking a fucking nap or like if you
had a kid I don't know I had to go pick
up my fucking kid from daycare because
it was sick all of these are valid
excuses in my opinion I don't have time
for someone telling me that I have no
excuses I have plenty of fucking excuses
I talked to someone the other day that
had me in any junk food in like six
months am I supposed to be impressed by
now because to me that's something that
an insane person does like do you homie
but you know what I'm gonna go fucking
eat some french fries over here every
once in a while like a fucking adult I
was at the gym the other day this girl
was like whoa you were really harder
than a rock star which I was like I wish
I worked out that hard and I was like in
the middle of some lunges I was like
dude I'm just here cuz I love food
fucking balance my friends balance I
mean don't get me wrong we need you
Fitness people to help motivate us and
tell us what the fuck is possible with
our bodies but fucking bitch I do not
have time for your attitude towards me
downloading like seven apps and needing
to play them for fun purposes is a valid
excuse the next thing I don't have time
for is fashion back shirt is probably
the most exhausting things keep up with
that I could ever possibly imagine
it just never fucking ends like the
second that you like get something
that's like trendy then it's not trendy
and then you're like fuck man
do this keep it until it comes back into
style like shit no I've got one thing I
wear 800 times in a row and then I'm
like fuck everyone fuck you I give no
fucks they called out for same outfit
wearing all the time like I'm genuinely
baffled at how people can't keep up with
fashion and always like have clothes
that like look good right now like
genuinely baffled how do you do that no
disrespect to people that post like
their outfits of the day I thoroughly
enjoy watching you pick an outfit for
the day but I certainly don't have time
to pick an outfit for the day because I
don't give a fuck and I do not have time
for that I feel like I've just been
adding wearing more jewelry over the
years like if you look at pictures of me
I'm just adding more and more jewelry I
mean that's I guess that's how I keep up
with fashion right that's really that's
super trendy because I just like wearing
all my jewelry at once cuz that I know
where it all is that logic Jen thanks
Janet well we're on that same topic and
in being brutally honest sometimes I
didn't have time to change my shirt
think I will literally go to bed take my
bra off wear that shirt that I wore that
day it depends sleeping it wake up the
next day just put my bra back on and
then go and everyone's like hey man
we're doing that shirt yesterday I'm
like yep
and I fucking slept that into I'm
literally like the most economical
person you'll ever meet a no shame in my
game
none I mean I save time money water and
amusing clothes for their original
purpose which is like protection for
your body and laughter the next thing
you don't have time for is their watch
like this thing has been on the wrong
time since forever and would I ever know
or care no because they don't use my
watch for the time we use my phone for
the time duh I can't even see this thing
in the dark watches have been dead since
like the invention of electronic
this is just a shiny bracelet right now
I'm trying a bracelet a shiny shiny
bracelet you it literally says 2:05 what
time is it the next thing I don't have
time for is going to change your life if
you have a puppy or a dog that likes to
pull the stuffing out of any toys
because I do not have time to buy my
dogs little toys all the time so they
can destroy them all so in a lot of my
videos people are always like you know
your moves are so much look good fucking
like there's shit everywhere and they're
mostly referring to the fact that
there's green and white pillow stuffing
like this everywhere but let me just
blow your mind for one second okay this
pillow I've had since Kermit was a baby
and he opened them up and he used to
pull all the stuffing out of it and
think it was so much and at first I was
like Curnutt fuck what the fuck term it
was my pillows but then I realized that
if you just leave it open it fulfills
their need to pull all the stuffing out
like yeah you come home and there's
stuffing everywhere but dogs are stupid
man just snuff it back in there every
single day they get the happiness of
pulling the stuffing out of something
while not destroying something new
everybody's happy they're happy I'm
happy
and I'm going to go out the fucking
store and buy toys all the time it's
fantastic so tell me that my house is a
mess fine
but I'm a fucking genius the next thing
I don't have time for is to go see
movies when they're in the movie theater
they just don't have time like I think I
go to the movies maybe like five times a
year tops
I mean even if I really want to see it
I'll rent it maybe except every time
that I want to rent a movie I don't even
have time to watch bad ones I just can't
risk it so I spend like three hours like
looking them all up on Rotten Tomatoes
and deciding which one's better than the
other ones because I'd rather do that
then watch bad fucking movie that's it
the next thing I don't have time for
work nothing against vine because think
behind is really fucking funny but I
don't have time for vine every day I
just like I go on there like once a week
I don't want to miss all the funny jokes
then like I just got a sign off it's
just enough for that it's too much
yelling everybody's fucking yelling what
are we yelling about I also do not have
time for the way that vine makes so
incredibly difficult to find a vine if
you ever see a vine that you really like
you can't find it you have to like
google it or look it up on YouTube like
it's so fucking ridiculous like all I
want to do is like find a bucketing vine
of a dog laughing that's it you can't
nope there's one find it better fucking
google it why am I going to another
platform to look up something on another
platform like that's your dick vine God
don't have time I don't have time for
your dick but I don't I don't have time
to close all of the apps like on my
phone or on my iPad I just like to wait
until my phone just ceases and then it
closes them all at once
it's also like it's it's really annoying
to do it anyways because when you swipe
it up you end up just like clicking on
it and then it opens it and it just
makes you want to throw it so I just
wait till it has a seizure and then it
closed does anybody really ever open
their app and then fucking
No nobody has time all right I will say
that with confidence ain't nobody got
time to open and close all of their apps
every time they fucking use them nobody
the last thing I do not have time for is
to check my mailbox at my house like my
physical mailbox at my house do you want
to know why because it's full of fucking
trash everything important that's coming
my way is coming electronically all my
bills like all that stuff it's not like
I need to check my fucking mailbox for
some important a smell there's nothing
coming I go like once a month maybe to
go check my fucking mailbox
I'm sorry mr. mailman for making you
shove more garbage into my garbage hole
maybe you should just take a look at
what's in your hand and fucking skip my
house you know what while you're at it
just fucking throw whatever is in your
hand into a fucking fire and take the
rest of the afternoon off I would never
be able to tell either would anybody
else you might feel like to a mailbox on
fire because it's a pack if a package is
coming to your house at least they put
it on your doorstep so you just like oh
I got a package and then you look at
your mailbox and you fucking flip it off
and then you just keep walking just
light the whole thing on fire
I don't want your twopence I don't want
your catalogs but I fucking I don't want
shit I think it actually had a male
person like take everything out of my
mailbox put a rubber band around it and
just drop it at my front doorstep so he
could jam more mail into my mailbox as
it didn't wanna fuck I didn't want
anything shouldn't that was it there I
thought that's how it worked if you
leave all the trash that you drop off
here and I don't bring
my house then you have to pick it up and
do something with it you just fuck you
lied about a fire make your kids a
bonfire and some hot dogs
fucking take the day off bro so yeah
that's part two of things that I do not
have time for maybe I'm fucking lazy or
maybe I'm just a wonderful person who
knows
let me know if you feel the same way
about any of these is anybody gonna come
see is they make sure you subscribe to
our Channel and good out of these every
Wednesday probably miss you we don't see
you as much because you like to be a
little don't be a stranger
and my lips met your head that's racist
okay but
