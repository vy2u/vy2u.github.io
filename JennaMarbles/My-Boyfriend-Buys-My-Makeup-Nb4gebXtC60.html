guys I wearing a little concealer right
now so we don't flag this video is
obscene graphic content someone tweeted
at me that there's the tag writer on a
youtuber challenge called my boyfriend
buys my makeup and that's literally all
this takes just tweet at me and I will
fix the video at this point fuck it but
someone named Jamie Page started it on
YouTube and I thought that this would be
a perfect thing for us to do together he
actually went to the vet today and got a
bunch of teeth out so we can only do so
much we're babysitting our drug dog I
don't recommend this because this shit
is so fucking expensive it's on fire it
really wasn't I paid for it I paid for
it then you pay found me ok god I felt a
little bit so I went with my boyfriend
to Sephora which is a Julien favorite
place to be in the whole world and I let
him pick out things for me you know it
was a lot more frustrating than I
thought it was going to be so this was
us earlier when we went to Sephora this
is already gonna be bad didn't saw let's
go Julien
an old Russian they don't have any
packages hanging from right Julian know
what do you have so far we have rusty I
said no brushes I have brushes no sir no
brushing you think that I said it like
five times three times for me I never
said of that you have almost no makeup
and only applicator you need to plan
your beauty beauty from how you like
that taste the rainbow on your face I
feel like you're trying to sabotage me
I know what this is any of you really
really thin lashes raise your fucking
fish they are not even there they're
just paying for nothing
the parties are lit yeah I foundation
foundation foundation ok I need like
blush did you just pick you Tiffany
relog dunking in another temple it's not
specific and it was not winter bronze
and it's April and it's not an ass honey
is now upgraded I was so expensive tell
me about it do something maybe people I
specifically said you don't need to get
any freshers or applicators and yet
there's a brush and a tiny green Beauty
Blender I don't see any brochure whoa
what's behind your ear how you keep
using your ears I paid for that there's
magical aside to chew on quick did you
just get it to eat it yes calorie free
marshmallows Katara
okay did you turn it into this dip no no
it's like sucking all the moisture out
of our mouth right now
can you please my god your mouth inhale
stop wiping things on me domestic bliss
I helped Julian a little bit because he
just kept picking out like lip pencils
and then trying to leave and it wasn't
enough to have a full face of makeup
like the without actually it wasn't are
you happy with your purchases I think I
am Elise we got more beauty blenders can
you tell me the process though and I
watch a fair amount of beauty videos so
I feel like I have the understanding of
like what I might die if I were just
packaging 99x packaging if it had cool
packaging I picked it because makeup
forever how did you go about picking the
color have a good picture z4k it's used
in 4k I'm not
I want to match it no you're not doing
my job I'm doing my makeup you just buy
it I can do whatever you want I want a
match
yeah sorry honestly it's not that bad I
mean it's a little light I wanted to
make you glow can you tell me why you
picked out a green concealer why would
you can feel something when you can draw
attention to it so you look a little
like an alien or a little rat sonic play
alien rat hmm how do you open this
look it you see where it's perforated
perforated do it again perforated why
like one of those words perforated
tickets for physical it's the valence
out like red yeah it's nice
Oh beautiful oh I I put it under my eyes
it was stupid I say this isn't that bad
Xbox or a little dead did you even see
it before you bought it no this is
actually pretty Julian I know I'm good
at it I personally like to top
everything off with some boss why did
you pick out that one CK mom you
actually cheated I cheated I said to
someone who work there I'm ready to get
the fuck out of here how do I find blush
color is pink no you bought it because
it was called hysterical yeah that
existed do you have another concealer
here by the way let's try that one this
one is and you also have this did you
get three concealers what are you trying
to say how did you pick those ah Julian
that's an expensive one though - you
bought a purple Lancome concealer oh so
you just told grape soda did you think
that this was something else yes
well now here's the final concealer
beautiful Oh looks good I want to move
over to hi shadow now these two
different eyeshadow palettes one is just
one color it's not a phallus is a
palette of one this one's a rainbow
color I want to use the dark blue purple
galaxy why don't you use that one if you
bought this rainbow palette why are
using the dark one of the top I fine
let's start with the pink on the top
left where do you want it um on your
I've left I think that's a nice time
it's like a nice little pink it says
this Barbie dinner makeup for the first
time ever
that's what happened we'll move on a
little to the galaxy then and then why
because I want to I would you buy a
rainbow palette and then you sometimes
you need it for moral support
sometimes I don't need hot sauce on my
food but I bring it to the table for
moral support
just in case that peace of mind is what
life is all about to me thank you good
night
so you bought this rainbow palette to
use miss pink is this Gallagher where do
you want a purpley color underneath that
like what you want why are you laughing
it's it's good we need to darken up the
tops a little bit so you want this on my
lid on top yeah this is very subtle this
is a subtle look that I wanted well at
least you kept like my face kind of
neutral to pull this off see that's kind
of the idea behind it that's why I only
got three concealers I cook you look
good
what's so funny let's move on to the
eyeliner now we're going to make a nice
little wing Collider bra Oh pytheas you
but you already use it trilliant on your
hand oh yes now cut it out just want to
make sure I row well and looks good
is it an ad this is waterproof so
definitely go to a pool party after
putting that on only pool party it's on
the top or bottom they're not the top
okay Jordan green and blue and purple
taste the rainbow
well we didn't use any of the rainbow
palette taste the rainbow
not bad fuck SoDo a big I love it Oh
Queen definitely are wallowing on the
bottom yeah but you don't love me you
know I'm honestly not that mad at this
blue eyeliner or canned dog it's the
combination of the blue and the green
that just feels very fat very cool so
now we're going to move over to the
eyebrows that's fun yeah like them
out of all the products in Sephora for
eyebrows you pick this just not even
like a full size product I mean I wanted
it to be at a golfing next we have
Sephora sticks to to our sewers Toulouse
Teniente
that's the tinted brow freeze I'd like
you to please do this left-handed I mean
I say that they're frozen
so cool I mean it's a look there you go
well it looks like a toy like a girl's
toy calling it a dildo
all right look like a dil-don't get out
are we ready to move on to the lashes
and finish up the eyes they said and I
quote it's the best thing that isn't
hair extensions what for your eyes no
there wasn't a just there whether you're
telling me in lieu of hair extensions
you could put a fuck ton of those in
your hair probably that dance probably
what they were talking about it does
Telegraph not almost got everywhere
don't get that on the couch he just
jammed up onto the back window they'll
know it's in there okay I wanted to what

it
I got Hydra it's a hydrating lip plumper
by Grande lips ariana grande's line of
makeup that is not true now we're doing
lipstick first so I got a la femme look
at this packaging oh my god

quads out before you work out hold on
I'm not done if you pick it stop baby
that's cute we're on to the lip liner oh
that's like spicy chocolate brown Julian

brilliant move any look great ah girl
