upright leisure in yeah you're standing
up useiess didn't I say a brightly to me
as you can see I have added a coat to my
leisure suit
I think it's subtle this pretty so I
didn't notice here hey guys we've made
two of these videos in the past one
where Julian cooked me my favorite meal
and I cooked - Julian's favourite meal
but I wanted to do this with desserts so
we are both vegan but Julian also has
something called celiac disease Oh which
means he can't eat wheat so vegan and
gluten frees a little bit of a challenge
sometimes and even though we live in the
second largest city in the United States
sometimes we just can't find delicious
things that are both of us can enjoy
right right why are you wearing that
helmet the whole time but one thing that
we have not been able to find is a
gluten-free and vegan cupcake
specifically red velvet because I would
say it's up there with my favorite
desserts
along with cheesecake which a vegan
cheesecake is super easy to make you
just take some nuts letting Ron you put
them in the freezer
it's whatever it's very easy but I want
to not make but to Lygia and enjoy watch
and Julian make me a batch of red velvet
it's all I'm cooking all of the cupcakes
look like someone that's gonna bake
today no in fact you look like big
vertical
walk out and I will come back with these
cupcakes already if you make fun of me
one more time probably just wing it
please don't
I want cupcakes not Aries shit what
we're making
deep throat by cupcake do we have a
squeezy bag for the icing are we gonna
have to use Ziploc thanks we're gonna
use that one the last couple cooking
videos that we did I was obviously
surprised that people liked watching us
cook but also that people are interested
in what we eat because a lot of people
seem to think that if you are vegan that
I wake up every day just with a craving
for some carrots I do I look like a
rabbit - you know bitch when you want a
hot tasty burger sandwich soda why when
you watch spaghetti okay just want to
worship of it that I like I'm not here
to eat lettuce you don't get this very
average looking 31 year old body from
sitting around eating spinach all right
trust me we haven't had cupcakes we bald
Kimmy in years I took a bite of this
shortening just to make sure it was good
before they got a person that stands
outside the DMV licenses for cheap the
reason I asked for cupcakes and not like
a whole cake is because I feel like
there's some finality to a cupcake
whereas if you just make a red velvet
cake a piece of cake is really like open
to interpret this is a predetermined
portion and so if you have five that's
on you we got pastel liners Oh Freddy we
use sort of sprinkles and get cupcakes
the other joy ml of the night at the
vending machine I just want to go enjoy
cupcakes with my boyfriend in the middle
isn't
then we should open a cupcake shop that
stays open 24 hours a day what are we
gonna call it coupley come get y'all
cakes oh how much I could have dropped
my cakes on every cupcake flavor is a
different vibe yes country boy I love
you one's called oh well I just called
I just called are you Javier why is no
one done this can I get one
this is why mom doesn't fucking love you
I'll have to Adam I don't have 3 hi
welcome to Chili's and what the fuck
Richard to go sift the flour blend cocoa
powder baking powder and baking soda and
salt
was it mean sift that means sift all of
that together or individually that
actually is making me feel safer somehow
that you're wearing helmet because I
feel like you actually need a helmet in
the kitchen because you're dangerous
dangerous platinum why are you crying
what's the point of this by the way mmm
it just makes it like light and fluffy
so then when you bake your cupcakes that
are like light and fluffy I think I
don't know
please stop time I think wow this sucks
he's going deep even Julian just
throwing that in there just pushes down
on all the flour you just said that no
put on the dish wrap now we're gonna put
2 tablespoons of cocoa powder in the
sifter Oh fun yeah need something from
their money
all right baking power get you a man who
sips dessert for you oh yeah this gets
set aside aside just a mix on my not
doing anything
no micromanaging it a large mixing bowl
oh fuck that was a large mixing bowl
stir together coke and milk or almonds
oh you can use either or where I'm from
okay where are you from I'm in Virginia
why why like why me spot you okay no I
said there Bonita this is a julienne
does like he knows enough conversational
Spanish to make yo so Mosca tanto que yo
absolute nonsense Spanish sentences yeah
I'm lucky water this is what Jenna
bought today that come on over here
people don't consult each other we
already have it nope don't have any
right I was just trying to drag you we
don't have yes
allow for one minute to curdle add sugar
oil and gel food coloring what because
you're sweet get a measuring cup don't
lick it
what's the deal with brown sugar all
right ladies honestly this property
looks like Rosanna pansino Channel look
at this setup this lighting is my
production value just no better sorry
Rosanna yo soy peligro this one's for my
Rosanna
some scrip follow that looks like blood
how much I don't know you just have on
it probably fine was that fall gonna be
big enough no you did this backwards can
you not like stress MIT noise in my ear
imagine if I drop this right now and
it's just shattered glass everywhere and
all it was all for nothing are you
breathing so hard I'm self-conscious
about my breathing me eating one these
are my face yes this don't kill it's
really nice okay
what I'm just tasting it for the no my
face
so let me pour batter into prepared
cupcake pan so I'm gonna just take this
and just drop them from real high up the
camera didn't record in the right time
oh really yeah are you sure we were
jamming stuff in your mouth and slopping
it all over the cupcake oh no it was it
was a technical difficulty I think the
dogs did it but this is what not
planning out portions look like they
start nice and even and then BAM
these ones are covered in your finger
like you jammed his finger in there and
then scooped it they're gonna taste like
fingers I just want yours Jim you know
what's cool about eating off the spatula
calories don't count what about you
didn't write you relax yet I feel stress
it's so stressful to not like fix all
the thumbs oh I guarantee you like
tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and find some
batter on the wall somewhere can you
just like maybe relax no I don't want it
productive so we gotta bake these at 350
Celsius not sure translates to about 800
degrees oh we got a beat together or the
most anemic does this look like Rosanna
pansino nerdy nummies we ain't got that
shit stop it so long
Jenny normally this helps me clean up so
this is a mess I apologize there's
literally a wet paper towel under the
mixer in this I was put over there by
the ball No so we need 1/4 a cup of
shortening so we need to soften 1/2 a
cup of butter everywhere like the top
isn't even on the almond milk Julian why
does it need to be
is there another hole get Julian like
the top side down on the food calling
that's gonna spill and make a mess
because where could it we're trusting
that it won't
two to three tablespoons of almond milk
Hey look you threw that under the does
that look like the trash dude lemon
juice and vanilla so I like to throw
them in the air I just cut it well okay
I lost the teaspoon do you know it's
probably clean its disgusting minutes
really half cups of that Austria sure
yeah it's really not good for you
one bag of sugar two shots of vodka
well done okay
oh my god three and a half cups of
powdered sugar honestly worth it all
right so I'm gently shovelling there's
nothing alarm just went off
oh look at those babies cooler they are
the better oh those look so good are you
doing I'm gonna show these on piped
honestly Christina Tosi is breaking you
know is weightless so now we're gonna
wait for our cupcakes so get cool enough

allow me to step in and say don't pipe
them while they're piping hi yo somos

five-year-old decorate cookies and it

okay I want you to try it so far the
presentation is very pretty
I like that extra food coloring things

chewy

how do you already have it on your face
oh yeah thank you happy leisure day hmm
I got some paper from that bite I feel
like I need to hire you a babysitter let
me stay up late I feel like we could
play around with the recipe to get the
cake like a little lighter and the
frosting a little lighter but like the
flavors really good what we're not gonna
do is sit at the table like a people and
purr for cupcakes what turn the camera
what we're never done this was really
nice of you maybe you're like thirty
like me where the exciting things in
life are like making yourself a sweet
that you didn't usually have or forcing
someone to bake a suite for you chef's
table on Netflix I know this isn't the
most exciting thing in the world but I
feel like a lot you guys ask us all the
time to cook stuff because you want to
see what we eat and honestly the answer
is the same thing that you eat just the
version that we eat we have hourly busy
month coming up and it's nice to just
spend some time together and cook some
food that we like now we can make
cupcakes and bring them to people we can
be those people that bring cupcakes why
did you just burn your finger because
not go to things oh let's do that those
people let's me those people post
cooking kitchen tour okay we got a plate
of
gorgeous cupcakes later to light the
candle for my date no dishes
everything's put away counters clean and
good to go
so we also learned a little spinach so
