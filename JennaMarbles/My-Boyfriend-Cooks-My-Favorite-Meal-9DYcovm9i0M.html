the I'm wearing bitch this is
called the leisure suit can't you see
them leisure ring I can see it
hey what's up you guys yes
so Julian just got back from his trip we
haven't seen each other in a couple days
we're both a little exhausted this was
actually all inspired by the fact that I
bought this leisure suit it's literally
called the leisure suit so that's what
I'm gonna do I'm gonna Lygia it and that
means everyone around me gotta do
for me who is wearing a leisure suit
yeah me that's right I'm just through
them there where you can reach them I'm
wearing a leisure suit and that's how
the leisure suit works anyway pretty
much all we can handle right now
it's just feeding ourselves but I
thought it would actually be a really
fun video to me cuz a lot of you guys
requests that I make cooking videos on
Julian's vlog channel actually we have
something called JJ's kitchen where we
just cook food instead of just forcing
my boyfriend to cook for me which would
be nice and fun and I mean I am wearing
my t-shirt I decided that I think would
be pretty cool if we did my boyfriend
cooks my favorite meal because I'd say
that my favorite meal is a little bit
interesting especially if you have a
favorite meal that like it's not like a
cheeseburger it's very specific so that
while they cook it for you you can wear
your leisure shoe and tell them
everything that they're doing wrong and
then it doesn't dates right and to keep
trying you know wait that's what we're
doing yeah you gonna cook me my favorite
meal and I'm gonna eat you the whole
time is my Leisure Suit my favorite meal
happens to be a delicacy from upstate
New York bitch is called a garbage plate
okay so for those of you that don't know
traditionally it's half mac salad
macaroni salad half like hope fries or
potatoes to cheese burger patties on top
and then it's covered like a meat sauce
ketchup mustard hot sauce the whole nine
it's delicious
I haven't had one
in years because I don't eat meat
anymore I see these ones on Beatrice and
say it then like french fries
than them and I'm like first of all you
got my dad they're using brown mustard
on there like it's a it's a disaster the
internet needs to clean their up
because no one apparently knows how to
make a true vegan garbage Lee so
Julian's gonna try I'm bill Alicia and
critique can I have some of them and for
those of you from other countries you
wondering why Americans got so fat it's
because we invent things like garbage we
already went to whale foods and got a
bunch of stuff mas o menos it's a little
bit like this they're not full
cheeseburgers that's what people fail to
understand about a garbage play is that
they're like they're like smash burgers
they're very thin burgers and they go on
top and you can get them with all
different kinds of stuff like hot dogs
Larry like hamburgers and hot dogs it's
just it's terrible for you we're gonna
do a traditional cheeseburger place by
the way I've never seen a video or
anyone's attempted proper vegan garbage
place so our sites probably been
searched there's nobody from Rochester
that's the vegan except for me I'm
kidding it's probably like fun let's do
mac salad first then go into the meat
sauce yeah then we cook the potatoes and
then the burgers yeah burgers are lies
would you like some chapstick no you
show you the ones some chapstick yes
your loss
so just like my father babish always
says you gotta have a little tray of
kosher salt a little tray a freshly
ground pepper
it seems so unnecessary making it
garbage please why are you here
fancy so we're cooking some la tap water
I'm anali Jitsu so get choppin by far my
least favorite thing in the kitchen boy
you chopping vegetables like chill out
you dusty narc mess you just gonna leave
that Virgo please clean it up alright do
you know how much of this you're cook
your cut
yes is to celery ribs just why I just
chopped all of them off of the head
there's a fourth for it onion but I'm
done for a half ok it's not your meal
it's my deal and I unlike the rest of
the sheeple in upstate New York do not
believe the Nick Tahoes has the best
garbage plate I really don't hold I
really at me fight me they might have
invented the garbage late but it is not
the best no we can't it was Julian has
not made the sauce that goes on the mac
salad yeah one thing I do know is that
you're gonna make it like bitter tasting
somehow like that Julian makes is like
so bitter and he's like should
we add more lemon I'm like no cup of
mayonnaise we're using just male dill
pickles and little pickle juice you need
two teaspoons of sugar and 1/2
tablespoons of Dijon mustard this as far
as I'm concerned is the only Dijon
mustard that exists it's all sugar go
away it's my favorite meal I'm making it
for you
this back cuz I'm just gonna leave it
out here until next week if I don't you
probably a chocolate a lot finer take a
chop
I do have picked chops
you know what's pick is the lens of the
camera inside the ball can you well you
looking like one pretty sweet you're on
Facebook I don't like a bite I just want
to taste oh don't get it up my hey
Joseph that's right that's good
back and don't it up don't touch it
no put that baby in it
don't say does it need some lemon don't
make it better as help that's perfect
does it need lemon mix it up real good
nice and good nice and real good I'm
actually like so surprised that that
tastes like my favorite part of this is
the backhanded compliment I think know
when you put it in the fridge no like
well can I also maybe suggest that there
was a ton of water and the
ratio is perfect I'm not gonna mess it
up just a tiny tiny bit I mean now it's
 mayo a Johanna you're wrong
you're not allowed to touch the tools
I'm cooking then we can work on the hot
sauce will you him cuz a lot of people
think that the hot sauce that goes on
top of a garbage plate is hot
sauce but it's not it's more like a
chili almost it's just like a meat sauce
it's not particularly like super
place that's what makes everything extra
crust you're doing is you crying baby
emotional people somehow you can't just
bamboozle make this emotion doesn't even
you think no no lemon
no lime no citrus of any kind yeah I'm
feeling pretty relaxed except for the
fact that everything that you're doing
right now is stressing me out
this one garlic over four that's four
garlic cloves I cooked your favorite
meals alright my reflex is to say sushi
but vegan sushi really ain't there yet
so probably pad thai are you kidding me
watch your mouth when you're talking
about my son pad thai listen to this my
idea if we have a boy child I want to
name him sand friends so Lomita come on
it's really good name what's in his
first name in Fran has no no yes
how about okay June get a load of this
Jerry Seinfeld so lamia then we could
totally market our videos if every
single one of them Jerry Seinfeld it
says just fry it doesn't say it Center
and when I see fry I just see hi here we
deliver it onion garlic fry hi good way
to remember and while I'm cooking down
we're gonna get down
with this bar you gotta have a few
utensils in play no it's not your recipe
we'll give me look at me aren't you
gonna pick such a simple recipe the we
simple recipe I've ever cooked when
you're critiquing me at the end can you
please remember that I've never made
this ever they go at the same terms
sophistication just like me this is
where I come from we need fire
extinguishers and all corners of the
kitchen everyone does
proper fire service especially you boy
did add some water for Julian because he
does not know the consistency and I do
we check on the back so it definitely
looks like vegan Mayo it looks okay what
are you doing now you gonna put these
tables in this fried blood pressure on
all other keep electronics on this side
plug in the deep fryer so we're gonna
dump those in crisp them up cook them
and then season a little
pepper and just have it ready to be on
the plate do you think all those are
gonna fit because there was an episode
of James's kitchen where we made fried
pickles and it was too much stuff in
there I lowered the amount of oil since
that houses that scenario the way I wash
dishes or wash they're fine them you
could eat okay picture this
my idea is you pretty much helped me get
to where I need to go now
I want to put together last few steps so
you can be a little bit surprised by the
progress Oh it'll be great
can I ask one request yes don't let the
ketchup and mustard are important of
course not we go and do it so you and I
talking alright you and I are gonna
figure this out oh she seems to be
really down with this plan all right so
let's go just go you can sit right there
you can smell all the goodness but I
don't know get lost what we're
doing over here is we are gonna heat up
this pan put somewhere on it get it
really really hot for these burgers what
we're looking at right now I think this
is looking pretty good
you got a season um right after they
come out of the fryer these are the
taters back to Burger town USA
Babylon scratch down with something
heavy
just a tiny bit of salt pepper alright
so those are just gonna melt really
quick we're gonna circle back to our
final station where we're going to
assemble everything you're not gonna see
my lovely face I'm just gonna show you
this
yeah hold on and leisure
I'm so excited right now I have
not had a garbage plate in so long
Julian has never had a garbage plate so
this is how you do it
just put it all over the whole thing
then you need yellow mustard none of
that diddly and you got a mustard
it all up looks like garbage but then
there's crazy people that like you know
probably either Chipotle bowl like one
little bite at a time
no you need to cut all of you and make
it like homogeneous you know anything
garbage play I feel like someone's
favorite noodle says so much about that
no my mind says but me and trash
look at oh my god are you excited
Oh Julia this actually looks so good
this would love everyone watching this
right now I was like I'm never going to
upstate New York that place looks gross
and you're right
it goes I want like your reaction to
tasting it cuz you've heard me talk
about it since we met each other look it
this is the perfect garbage late look at
that's what it's supposed to look like
I'm good I'm gonna cry it tastes like a
garbage love you obviously the burger is
different but the way that you crisp it
up makes it taste just like a
garbage but I'm I'm like I'm gonna cry
actual tears so just a bunch of ketchup
then imagine my friend yeah that sound
that's a taste I've never had before
right that is wild it's not good it's
really good finally can't group
it in with a burger and I can't quite
group it in with like barbecue food it's
like somewhere something about having
like mac salad with like a burger now
imagine is really and it's - man and
you're wasted right now tell me that's
not the best thing you've ever eaten
yeah
holy this is really good you made
me my favorite meal it's just so
good I feel like you treated me like the
princess but I am not this open Hasek
The Onion's
no pickle can you give it a score out of
10 this is 10 out of 10
no I didn't think that a vegan also
gluten-free I did not think that you
could make it taste like garbage Lee but
it really tastes just like it I
was a little skeptical of the beyond
meat in the meat sauce like that it was
gonna be the wrong texture but it
doesn't matter
oh oh man this was really nice so
glad you like it
good job on making it was a lot of fun
I'm excited to like make this more it's
what I'm like a labor-intensive recipe
I'm sorry for doing that to Bob family
bitch look at this woman sometime I'll
have to make your favorite food for you
although we did modify some of the
recipes I'm gonna put the recipes that
we did use in the description so in case
you ever wanted to try this absolute
pile of trash you can yeah that's right
I just always make a nice video spend
some time together I could yell at you
about being a tornado in the kitchen
make sure you subscribe to my channel
and put on your piece every Wednesday
slash there is it and you know I'm gonna
do I'm just gonna lead you my
ass off with my favorite but this
Bluebird no thank you
oh man the wine just really bounces off
you know we should do next time garbage
plate cam put a GoPro in the middle of
the garbage plate and just look at this
 from the inside
damn it what's wrong with you god you're
so unrefined so I'm going to fax you the
list or email it I feel like it's such a
nice thing to do though your significant
other is to like have them cook your
favorite food if they've never made it
especially if they've never made it so
you can micromanage them the entire time
until they literally tell you to give up
and kids are the Vian Julia Carson said
hi you did the impossible
you made me a glass plate boy this is my
heart on a plate you should eat your
heart chest and don't forget someday we
will have a son and his name will be San
Fran so San Fran sold me that if you
watching this video for you alright see
you guys next week bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
