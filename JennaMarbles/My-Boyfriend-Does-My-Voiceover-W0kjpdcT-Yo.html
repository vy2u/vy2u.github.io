great Thanksgiving and I wanted to make
this video because I saw it going around
in the beauty community give it up to
the beauty community again I have such a
crush on you you guys make dope videos
it's where your boyfriend voices over
your makeup tutorial and so I just
wanted to do it because it looked like
fun here we go
my boyfriend is going to voice this over
please don't listen to anything that he
says it's all garbage it's all lies and
garbage all right hey guys welcome to my
tutorial uh I gotta put my hair up
because it's in my way right now but I'm
gonna do my makeup for you guys that's
broken my makeup is really easy I do it
everyday and this is how I do it so
basically I start with putting
foundation on my face its foundation
sometimes it doesn't get out of the box
you have to shake it frustrated uh and
this is my ball foam and you can eat the
ball of foam when you're done which is a
great little thing there's no calories
see it's good so I'm just putting
foundation everywhere so it's like a
blank piece of paper with a ton of
makeup on it and then there's this which
is a little bit of foundation oh it's
yeah it's for my eyes eye foundation
this works if you like put it directly
in your eye
for enhanced night vision this is NYX
and it's blurry but okay so that's uh
this is okay so I'm drawing into my eye
brows right now see the thing about this
is I prefer like a sharpie but we were
out of sharpie so I used makeup and I'm
drawing in my eyebrows which seems to be
working pretty well yeah no it's it's
actually working kind of badly I wish it
would work better it looks kind of weird
I'm not happy with it I'm a little upset
I need to get my eyebrows done or just
gone
yeah there's a dog behind me and always
looking at ah so yeah I'm still doing
the eyebrow thing I I think it's I think
it's working
I kind of wish it would just be done
okay here we got never done all right oh
no no no it's just darker on the
eyebrows we're down with the eyebrows
yet oh so now we're like now we're like
shaping the eyebrows we're using the the
negative space this is art people okay
so what I like to do is I like to really
get up and I'm done I don't know I'm
done okay so we got really bright
colored and then we were doing this on
top of my eyes and I think this is a
really good thing because it accentuates
my makeup when I put this on and I'm
going for a darker shade in the back of
my eyeball because I'd like to see
behind me you know when they always say
is that person have the eyes in the back
of their head well yes I do
I have eyes on the back of my head and
now I'm putting makeup on the back of my
eyeballs in my head all right so I'm
doing the underneath part which is
getting dangerously close to my eyeballs
and I'm getting crazy Harvey just
watching it okay so now we're going to
the other eye this is really great if
you want to see the exact crease of your
eyeball and you want yeah so up that was
in my eyeball okay so now we are doing
eye liner if you are a really bad kid
and you always drew on tablecloths as a
kid you're gonna be good at this so I'm
good at this
I can draw really well I have a lot of
lot of practice but see here we're going
to draw a little pointy thing towards
the end because we are a cat rawr and
we're going to go upwards but somedays I
feel really everyone really upset so I
go downwards you do not want to see me
do makeup on those days so we have a
little kitten eye and now we oh I hate
this for oh my god so we're drawing into
the waterline of our eyeball we are
literally making up our eyeball okay so
this is this is easily the worst thing
ever
okay so we're done okay now we're just
out via fake lashes
nothing is focusing okay it's
everlasting which means if you put this
lash on once you will never forget how
bad that lash was it's everlasting how
bad it is or it's good I don't know so I
like to draw on the lashes because they
come in a light tone but I like to make
them darker so I like to draw and then
shake them around spiritually like like
you just saw okay now I'm going to
magically assume them onto my body
there's a magnetic force in fake lashes
that bind to the human face and that's
see I'm darkening it again oh I got some
of my hands see look how messy I am oh
so quirky look it's all coming together
it's like oh this is beautiful
I want to kiss myself let me look around
be goofy okay here we are here we got
more powder
this is powdering I like to powder with
stuff I can eat too because at the end
of the night I just lick my own face
it's funny okay so now I'm contouring
and you can con tour with me I'm going
on tour haunt the word contour comes
from an ancient myth about centaurs
because centaurs were the best at
contouring centaur contour contour can
fool people we can make them think our
face has features that it does not make
up is a good deceitful trick people so
I'm sure I'm blushing my ear but
blushing my neck
blushing more of my neck I like blood
blush up I'm blushing my neck but I like
blushing my neck right after I shaved my
face because it the blush sticks really
well okay you know okay so now I've pink
yeah tonight I went with pink normally I
go with clear I like the invisible cloak
effect on my face so when you look at me
I'm not there that's probably my
favorite shade okay so now I have
some cheese oh no what is that brown
chocolate powder doing more on my cheeks
there's a lot of stuff you do to your
cheeks sometimes I'll just draw targets
on my cheeks and then people punch me
and knock me up now there's something
for my mustache this is mustache wax
this is good because it doesn't irritate
the skin okay so now we're back up to
the eyeballs which I thought we were
done with I hate this but we're doing a
little white spot on the inside of our
eyelid fall under our eyebrows we can't
leave it alone
I think we're highlighting doing
highlighting I guess this is what you
would call in a play this is a character
foil the highlighting makes the eyebrow
look better like a character for its now
we're doing now this is what I like to
do with my I like to do my my lip my lip
with lip gloss this lip gloss this is
the Kylie lip kit and is only available
in Ukraine and I flew there once to get
it and so I'm using it it's the shade
it's actually called rotten cherry it's
my favorite shade and this is something
else okay so this is mascara
it looks like I'm digging into my
eyeballs which I kind of am but you have
to do this in order to get a good effect
on the mascara I love mascara personally
because I feel like it's it's fun to
play with the little tool because it's
like a you can like you know you can
mess around with a little bit and then
I'm doing my bottom mascara which again
I don't enjoy because I my eyeballs just
up I'm just spraying my face now this is
a great way to cool off because makeup
can get you really really hot okay see
so hot
and I'm done and I'm in slow-mo now so
