because you bought it for me
Thank You Julian so I've mentioned this
in the past and I dug Kermit has a soap
fetish it took us a long time just to
get it like on camera because he usually
sneaks into the bathroom or like the
shower where there's some sort of soap
somewhere and he rubs his face against
it and he loves it like he loves wipes
and he loves like bars of soap or soap
residue and it's like kind of creepy
like to avoid the other day we found a
bar of soap like tooth marks in it but
just like one like he took one good bite
and was like oh yeah but I don't know
why I've never thought to do this before
because I don't think it's bad for him
like he's not eating it like he just
wants to rub his face on it so what I'm
gonna try to do I have no idea this is
gonna work is have him review some soaps
so this might take a little bit of
creativity a little bit of patience I'm
gonna have to leave the room and like
try and catch him doing it but I got a
big guy yourself here basically Kermit
has it so I got a number of different
types of wipes and a bunch of different
kinds of soaps what I did forget about
buying soap though is that you can't
like go into the store and buy a single
bar of soap so I had to buy like these
packs of fucking soaps stocked up with
soap until forever if you dirty come to
my house I got the soap heywood soap you
guys yes all right I'll leave see you
guys I say we just try and do this like
a couple at a time and see what kind of
soap does Kermit like the best
this is my dog reviewed soap like for
real it's not clickbait it's like we're
really doing so I think I'm gonna start
with like should we start with wipes or
should we start with soap okay so I
think the way that I want to do this is
to do like three at a time and narrow
down his favorites okay so this one is a
yes to hydrate and restore it smells
like coconut this is a Neutrogena
cleansing towel it I know that he has
rubbed his face on these because I have
purchased these before so I know he
likes to rub his face on these but I
don't know if he prefers to rub his face
on me
and this is a Cetaphil gentle cleansing
cloth
Sampath is the gentle creature come
EECOM do you like any of these
that's one's favorite let's this true
soap fetish out don't really care for
that one how about this one bud how
about this one what about this coconut
one do you like that one
what is it what's the matter mom didn't
get you enough wipes and soap so we had
to take a little bit of a food break
because someone has Cushing's disease
and gets very hungry all at once
not in this elf mood alright now we're
now we're taking a fighting break are
you guys done carmit no one is judging
you we know you have a soap fetish it's
okay just let it out
why are you still crying what if we
tried some actual bars of soap look it
okay this one is dial this is it's a
gold clean rinsing and non dry oh do you
smell that
okay it's like enough of this wipe I
want some soap okay I'm getting I'm
opening it for you truly if my dog has
the soap fetish this one is dove oh cool
moisture what do you think about cool
moisture look I'm opening a bag of treat
why don't we throw in a little something
different this one's Irish Spring
there's this one
oh I like that one
whoo this is what I catch him doing in
the ship
thank you somebody leave her door open
he just does this in there like the
biggest creep in the world Wow
I mean this is pretty overwhelming he
prefers Irish Spring the most out of
these wipes and these other soaps
cremini what about this one you want to
smell this one cause all this one here
but but it's right here oh don't don't
lick it oh it's right does anyone know
why he does this like he does it on like
dead stuff
like is there something in some soaps
that is like that smells like dead
animals Wow Jeremy loves Irish Spring
the funniest though is when he does it
on certain like lush bath stuff that has
like glitter in it and then he gets
glitter all over his face she likes to
dial
oh he just licked the dial Oh Oh karma
don't like it but no you like this one
at all no you like these - you like this
one a lot we're not judging you this is
a safe place
what it's like style oh he really likes
style oh oh oh
lick it okay he's giving the he likes
the dial I think he likes the Irish
Spring the most so far that's his number
okay cleanse your palate so friends
so for that's his number one but I think
dial is like a close second but he keeps
trying to lick that one
alright so dove not so much dove we can
put in the pile with the wipe so I mean
we still have some more soaps in here
for you to try caress
fine fragrance daily silk what do you
think about that but this one's a little
different this is a raw sugar pure bath
though oh that one's textured look at
the Hat Wow
okay I mean you can start reviewing it
as soon as you want to Shea Moisture
coconut and hibiscus shea butter so this
one did you smell this one yet you don't
like those this is a different dove this
is a pink rose do you like that one this
is the last one that we got we only got
eight bars of soap because I figured
that was a lot of soap bourbon cedar oh
this one this is like your heaven
there's soap all over the floor right
now what's the matter you don't like
your selection so I went upstairs and I
got some of the stuff that I have up
there you don't really care for most of
these other soaps so I'm gonna put them
away and you're really not playing along
with the wipes at all even though in the
comfort of your own bathroom
you love wipes I mean you like this one
which one do you like
I like when you do the glitter ones cuz
it gets all over your little face I'm so
sparkly so he doesn't like any of those
we're looking for a very specific type
of soap I think I don't think that he
likes bath bombs because they have that
like baking soda you smell to them I
think he likes like straight-up so I
guess I'm just trying to figure out why
my dog is in the fucking shower all this
is out back mate you want to try this
one
you smell that you like that one
Oh Oh you have another winner good boy
but you can't smell it yeah wow this has
been a lot dogs noses are so sensitive
he smelled a lot of soap so I'd say
these are these are the top three Irish
spring out back mate from lush and dial
yeah this is like a BuzzFeed video $1.00
so versus $20 so don't worry I'm not
gonna throw any of the soap out okay so
you can have it cuz I know you're gonna
want it later when no one's watching you
so you can really get in there oh this
is your favorite soap yeah I think
that's your favorite if I had to guess
based on his enthusiasm I would say that
out back by lush is probably in third
place in fact there were only three
soaps that he was really actually
interested in at all they all smell like
relatively like masculine I'd say like
he doesn't like the florals or the
flower ease he's not interested in that
kind of stuff
which is a little confusing to me
because it feels like he's in my shit 24
fucking 7 but apparently he's not into
that he's into this sandalwood II
whatever this is followed by our number
2 which is this gold bar of dial he
licked this one he actually wants to eat
this which concerns me this smells just
like like a hospital and in first place
by far Kermit's favorite soap in the
world is Irish Spring this he
immediately gravitated towards and I'd
say he's the most excited about this
video probably can't be that much longer
cuz I think he's getting completely
overwhelmed by soap smell so I know this
video is like not that much like there's
not a lot going on but hey to be fair
you clicked on a video that says my dog
reviews soap okay so what did you expect
but in case anyone was wondering this
soap choice of sermons worldwide is
Irish Spring so if you're a service are
you have a service
should give them some Irish cream
because they really like it a lot they
want about their faces on them you did
good but I know it's a lot of soul oh so
you think this is that Kermit wants to
smell like the dominant nail in the
house yeah right thank you so is it
because you're sexually attracted to it
is that your sexuality is it soap well
thank you for playing along we're so
glad that we figured out what you like
so that we can always have some stocked
in the bathroom for you so you can rub
your little face all over it yes you can
well yeah I mean that's it is this video
dumb yeah but what am I gonna do now we
already did it it's made it's over it's
done so make sure you subscribe to my
channel I put in abuse every Wednesday /
Thursday since you're such a good boy
why don't we see what Sara prefers Irish
cream or dog crack
you're a good girl G help my dog is
broken subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
