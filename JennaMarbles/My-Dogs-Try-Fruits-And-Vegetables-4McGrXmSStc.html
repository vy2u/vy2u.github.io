see you
you know I don't know what's going on
with you it's like you you're in this

this works you have to try foods don't
you watch the videos where people try
candy and stuff what's your deal you
have to try you're not even trying your
sister's trying all right why don't we
try something a little more familiar to
you guys it's grass it's wheatgrass yeah
you want to smell it
you want pee in it because the internet
likes doing this here's a cucumber what
was just kinda terrified all right
here's an eggplant Oh Oh my bowl which
one's worse like both I'm jumping on
marble they're vegetables who hurt you
Kermit looks like a human baby I can
conclusively say that the only one of
these dogs that could have ever survived
in the wild is peach because Alicia is
curious as to what food is permit and
marbles just you wouldn't last a day
unless you found a person to befriend
you don't have enough teeth to even kill
anything
so I mean you didn't have me here Oh
fucked they were ungrateful I feel like
they should you know at least give me a
kiss
marble would file this under a traumatic
experience
Kermit files it under stressful and
peaches just here for a good time
yeah make sure you subscribe to my
channel put out new videos every
Wednesday slash Thursday I'll see you
guys next week if you have a big dog I
bet they'll eat lots of things like a
grateful dog know what you guys can
clean it up got cleaned up yourselves
then take out the garbage maybe empty
the dishwasher once in a while just
saying you're just sittin on a
strawberry well it's sad
