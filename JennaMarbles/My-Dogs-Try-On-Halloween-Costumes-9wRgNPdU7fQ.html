get this sensitive one is it an original
idea no but is it the video that we all
want to see yes
Carmen Moe every year for Halloween I
feel like I spend way more time or money
on my outfit and I do on my dogs and
everyone always tweet to me they're like
what are the dogs mean for Halloween and
it's always like an afterthought so this
year I wanted to make sure that it was a
forethought that they got their costumes
before I did my BA would you like to
join us
cool shirt Wow so I went out and I
bought a bunch of different costumes for
the dogs and we're just gonna have a
little fashion show because this is what
I want to do with my time my eyebrows by
the way are still very bleached
I just penciled them in because I tried
to do a bleached brow look like this and
I looked terrifying alright I think that
we're gonna do this like dog by dog and
we're gonna start with a little go yell
here
alright peachy so the first costume that
I got you was this beautiful Princess
Leia
now the sizing of these are a little
weird because they're just like extra
small/small medium/large which for dogs
is like it can mean anything this is a
Star Wars costume obviously but I did
not realize how much of fucking Monopoly
Star Wars had on dog costumes like every
costume is the Star Wars costume they
waken it in over there not like George
Lucas doesn't have a bajillion fuckin
dollars anyways except she's eating it
okay you have to go on the ground okay
I'm very sorry let go happy alright
let's get your wig honey don't worry
these here's look number one Wow
miss wheet standing there okay this is
fucking a plus go soon how can she walk
around pitch a girl come here can you do
stuff in that area you just like love
this wig this one is so good she looks
like a painting
yeah you look so pretty
oh I've had it with this leg okay this
costume like looks incredible like it's
amazing for a picture but wearability is
like in right near zero now you're gonna
be a little bad dog
oh this these are wings Oh cute hey
peach I wonder she tried to chew it it's
like nasty it's like something she's
been chewing on for months
it's like feathers but hair that's not
shaped for a Nikki head huh this she is
all right it's it honey
well what a good girl I use that so
fucking cute she's having a lot of fun
too
yeah she really looks like she's
thoroughly enjoying herself it's like so
adorable but I don't think she can move
come on can you move in it Wow
he's it excuse you all right so she can
move in it she just doesn't want to is
that we get headed she yeah the head is
a key get out eh was already married to
Kermit in a previous video and I did
make her wedding gown but this is the
pre-made bride costume with hands do you
want to relive your wedding
why didn't it come with a veil or
anything to dress up her beautiful face
with good girl or her feet you getting
so yeah so beautiful no one invited you
know it's like a level five permit like
a level five wearable like she can move
her legs she can walk around in it
she's not like comfortable in it it's
very cute it's still not my favorite
just velcro honey nice and tight and you
breasteses
alright peach what are you thinking the
peach pizza do you like it I thought it
was gonna be a little bit cuter than it
is right it should just be like a piece
of pizza from her face down yeah yeah
this is kind of weak I'm kinda
disappointed so this last one again star
wars this claims to be one size but we
had to try it because I mean look at it
what the fuck yeah you're gonna have a
little guy riding you what the fuck is
going on one size my ass though like the
reins need to be shorter Jacob's Ladder
bitch I think that's as good as we're
gonna get it woah it's awful giddyup
peach come on
wow so realistic
I guess just vote in the comments what
you think peach should be for Halloween
but I also really liked the bat dog it
was really cute pretty cute re peachy
girl we all done he's the only dog that
we have that actually like appreciates a
shirt we'll be judging them on fit
comfort and cuteness cuz if it's not
comfortable we don't want you to wear it
this one's a football player right oh no
your legs are gonna fit in here and here
comes your helmet alright but your ears
definitely don't fit in those ear
whole how do you feel Wow
show us your tail listen to my voice
okay do you want to take the hat off and
just try the outfit that better is that
better or worse still still not feeling
it Kermit no no no not a choice not a
choice go Kirk so the next one I found
you is a bear this goes around you hello
how is this an extra-small
what's with these sizes you look awfully
cute but it's too big for you what do
you think bud not your favorite at least
this one's like soft oh here he goes
he's laying down wobble wobble permit
what do you have in your mouth I love
you so much but you test me everyday boy
come what's enough it's like that mean
what do you have any milk shoes go this
one's just like a shirt it looks like it
might be a little big on you but at
least it'll be comfortable honey maybe
what dog is shaped like that these long
arms
look Wow okay Spock's hair is not this
long
do you like the wig mumble he can't his
sleeves are too long ball no just like
be quiet for a second I just want to see
if he really goes to sleep it's like why
he likes t-shirts you put it on him and
he just gets really relaxed you know but
I think this is too relaxed this is like
a dangerous level of relaxed I want to
try your last one oh it's a dinosaur oh
this is never gonna fit hiss looks like
a lot for you huh it's okay it's like
bigger than his whole head do you think
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
fairies this is an incredibly
threatening dinosaur from rare breed
really cute you don't hate it you just
you want to sleep in it if there's such
a good boy honey okay maybe this is good
for a dog of a little more energy
all right Carly it's finally your turn
this was the other version of what
barbels just had on it's just a
Triceratops head the Triceratops
twice their man in his eye poor thing
yeah it needs more dinosaur yeah is kind
of just like a lazy costume but I do
like the idea of having a trite saris
theremin Triceratops again a Star Wars
costume again as all they have okay this
is not gonna fit you just get a bunch of
head costumes I guess you are the middle
child after all so I don't know that's
awfully cute you look like a pretty cute
Ewok honey okay so far honestly just
this headpiece is like the most
functional costume that we've gotten
like you can wear that not freak out the
whole time you wanna be you walk for
Halloween you walk do you remember the
time that mommy dressed you up like
Harry Potter this is a little like that
but it comes with its own glasses so I
don't have to make you any I'll do your
glasses first these are really cute I

look great
you've never looked better come in it he
is like the most patient dog with my
bullshit that there is like I put up
with him and he puts up with me like he
knows the deal I misses like ten out of
ten but like the fact that he endures
this at all
he's a real good boy he's he's a ten out
of ten good boy wait can we take a
picture together
how do you like this I feel like is the
perfect outfit for Kermit because he's
actually Heike very creepy this is for
when you follow me into the bathroom and
try and smell my underwear
I mean it's cute he's reached his final
form this one is sushi this is supposed
to go like this yeah Kermit

what a sushi chef wears but he is the
sushi what are you and your sushi guy is
it your favorite or no do you want to be
Waldo you kind of want to be Waldo don't
