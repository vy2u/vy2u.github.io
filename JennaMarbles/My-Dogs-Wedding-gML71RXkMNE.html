was last night I know a lot of people
are feeling a lot of different kinds of
ways just know that I respect you I
respect people with different opinions I
respect our democracy in fact the only
people that I don't respect are the
people that didn't vote at all I feel
like the consequence for not voting
should be you just get forever haunted
by someone who died for your right to
vote with that being said though I am
not confused at all about my role on the
Internet's not to judge you or preach at
you or anything like that the best thing
to do today is to just make the world a
little bit less serious what do you say
so what I decided to do is been a long
time coming I have two dogs of the same
breed and you know what I'm gonna marry
them I've been thinking about it for a
while today seems like the perfect day
to just spring everybody together with
some love right weddings make everybody
so happy just remind you that love is
what life is about and it's gonna be
fine we need some love right now
don't cry Kraft I love you daddy so the
first thing I'm gonna do obviously is
focus on the bride I got some tulle I
got some other tool and this beautiful
lace Oh oh you're so pretty baby girl
Wow what if we just make you a head hole
getting fitted for your dress is hard
huh I'm gonna do that Wow Paigey good
girl it's like you know the deal huh
this isn't your first rodeo is this that
we can just leave that for your train I
mean that's pretty ready I mean how do
you want to feel on your wedding day oh
my god is gonna mark it a little bit
okay what do you think
over or under your dress hey hey PJ
peach peach oh my god runaway bride some
of you may be thinking to yourselves
well what exactly is marbles role in all
of this I was going back and forth
between having him be the flower girl or
being the one that actually marries them
I think I want him to
marry them because although he would
make a beautiful flower girl you know
he's kind of an important role in their
lives he's like their alpha so it makes
more sense pleaser
all right why don't I cut this in half
because this is ridiculous for a dog one
layer regular one layer hollow so
another fun fact about peach and Kermit
is that they came from the same breeder
and although they aren't like brother
and sister or like Kermit isn't her dad
Kermit's dad is like the stud so like
Kermit came and then like after another
couple litters Ben was peaches litter so
he's probably like her distant uncle so
this is technically incest it's okay I'm
not here to judge them you know and your
dogs so like Who am I to sit so here's
her dress so far I'm gonna work on
leeches accessories but time is of the
essence we're having a day wedding and
I'm feeling the stress Oh God we're
gonna make you a little necklace and I
got you this we're gonna make you a
little flower crown it's so pretty we
Chi and then let's do some of this now
I'm going to work on the things are a
little more time-consuming like the
outside the actual wedding venue itself
needs to get made so I'm gonna go do
that about this like trellis because we
want to make it look nice
looks pretty nice Lilla that's right
very Bridal much wedding yes we have a
bunch of fake orchids we're gonna try
and put on this trellis that we already
shoved into the ground and it's
disgusting
is this crazy no and yes it just feels
like the right thing to do making a best
business hire me to make your wedding
but you clean up my fucking mat now
that's beautiful ready for a wedding
Oh when the Sun sets it's gonna be
coming from that way so we wanted to
make it so we could still see we're
gonna have a little like a runway might
have to move our kale cuz you're in the
way they're gonna get married click
right there so we got to decorate that
we got to figure out something that
marble can sit on to marry them I mean
this is looking pretty done let's do it
Riaan down to the wire here most of the
chairs are now outside getting ready for
your wedding we got to make you a tux
thinking I could put the tux part like
right there he's just wearing a cape
like that looks kind of nice though
curved you're done with your fitting for
now Wow I mean you look fucking nuts
Thanks I brought all my wedding attire
do you think you do I know all right I
fact at that time you learn something
new every day it's not very good but I
do know the basics of it
what is it tuxedo look like hot food
this tuxedo on there me it's pretty cute
I'm hoping that it looks right oh my god
that looks good all right so we just
made a game-time call and we realized
that if we made Marvel a tux also and
like takes away from Kermit's special
day so we're just gonna have him wear a
bow tie all right I mean he's already
wearing a tuxedo basically like a little
penguin yeah just ready for the wedding

which we come together before the
universe to recognize and commemorate

between these two dogs who gives this
bride today I do tight if there's anyone
in attendance who has cause to believe
