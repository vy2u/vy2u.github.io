the low-calorie recipe I knew that but
early poured a pot of butter into
cookies then you mix it really slowly
and gently while you tell it how much

this technique see that you can't learn
that at school you can only learn it
from having a vagina you were supposed
to get a pan that the bottom of it drops
out so that you can like take it off and
the cheesecakes like they but because
you don't feel like going to a fucking
store where they sell fucking hands and
you only go to the grocery store just
put it in the pan that you bought there
