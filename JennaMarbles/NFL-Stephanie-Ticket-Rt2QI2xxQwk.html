of sports but I like watching sports and
I like to rout Furman teams and get
excited and have a good time with some
chicken wings whatever if you watch
sports and a group of people there's
like sports watching etiquette and for
whatever reason there always seems to be
that girl in the room its ear
regurgitating sports facts that you know
she doesn't know or making it impossible
for you to enjoy yourself while you're
doing anything she's taking away from
your sport watching experience but
fortunately for you if you don't have
this person I created her for you this
is the NFL
Stephanie ticket now before all you
Stephanie's get mad just picked a
stereotypical girl's name P NFL
Stephanie ticket life expert
play-by-play commentary oh my god the
energy inside the Metrodome is like so
palpable right now like if you're a
little kid how bad do you want your dad
with moisture over his shoulders because
you just won the Super Bowl me that run
was a huge game for Adrian Pearson my
friend fucked him he did a really great
job in off that ball that handoff he
handed it off that guy look right there
that Oh Jay Simpson I got a live murder
tomorrow but that's just like a thing he
didn't turn Ashley after all my years
watching football
I'm pretty sure kegger does not work top
because look how hiding but no dick
either
the NFL Stephanie ticket also comes with
these bonus features plans for Saturday

your dad at work being a garbage truck
driver and you look filthy like you see
that hole and your jeans that's the best
part of your outfit because there is no
G neither the NFL Stephanie ticket now

every turnover

Jackson door

major league by Stephanie the word
rainbow that's his job after all ball he
hit backward so run away okay can
somebody excluded but to me like why
would you want your get to be like it

saying in the latest edition inside
Stephanie's octagon between his rustling
experience and his like really fast and
striking ability like so diverse while
this is his third time inside the
Octagon he's a contender Walter I wonder
if they like shade their chat and then

you spins around with his fists
backwards and they say it's a spinning
back-kick with joy like you're spinning
