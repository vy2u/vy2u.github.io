today's video is not gonna be that funny
and it's an extension of something I
said and the things boys don't
understand number two that I made a
couple weeks ago I mentioned about how
nice guys do not finish last and I got
sort of an overwhelming response that
you guys wanted me to talk a little bit
more building because it makes me
fucking furious and this is just my
opinion you're more than welcome to
disagree with me I encourage you in its
Darden arguments let me just describe to
you what this means for those of you
that don't know this is the saying that
guys like to use when a girl doesn't
like them or when a girl is broken up
with them and then start seeing someone
else a guy will be like all nice guys
finish last I'm such a good guy and no
one wants to fucking date me boo fucking
hell and I also think this goes
hand-in-hand with the idea that those
same people seem to have about girls
dating douchebags and girls love jerks
okay this this is the same guy that
thinks that this is how the world works
the first reason why a nice guys don't
finish last is because you're already
finishing first in something that's
being a fucking idiot
I really could just end the video there
because I mean beau that's a sound
argument you're not last you're first so
uh you have no point I'm gonna keep
going just to make sure that you never
fucking say again I'd say 90% of the
time that I've ever heard guys say this
it's about like some really hot girl
problem here my friend
is that you're fuckin swinging for the
fences you're in the batter's box trying
to crush bumps into the stance but you
can't hit a fastball there's a reason
why beyonce is married to jay-z why
Angelina Jolie fucks and sucks Brad
Pitt's dick off I mean come on people
look for their equal they like to feel
equal in a relationship smart people
like other smart people funny people
like other funny people people like to
have things in fucking common you're
probably very nice but I know that you
have nothing in common with a very
good-looking model that is completely
obsessed with material belongings and
can't hold a conversation with a rock
you have nothing in common with her she
dates ridiculously good-looking guys
that are also obsessed with material
belongings aka people they
you think our douchebags that's who she
has things in common with that doesn't
mean that girls date douchebags and
jerks that means that you don't like her
choice of mail and they happen to share
a lot of common interests with each
other so good for fucking them you're
really just setting yourself up for
failure because what's happening is you
want to put your dick in her and she
won't let you so everyone that she likes
is a douche bag and you finished last
because you're too nice you know
reference comes to my's when the Joker's
talking about how I'm just a dog chasing
cars I wouldn't know what to do with one
if I caught it that's you you are
chasing cars and if you caught one of
these fucking LA girls that wants you to
buy your Gucci bags and take her out
there every fucking night you look what
kind of fucking relationship is that a
stupid one what are you gonna do take
her your mom's basement and shore up
play fucking Dungeons and Dragons like
know that girl that you're talking about
clearly likes two things in a guy looks
money I don't see where nice fits into
that list you're fishing last not
because you're nice because you're
attracted to someone for the wrong
reasons and in the rare circumstance
that a guy actually uses this phrase in
a way that might make sense that's when
you really need to turn around and be
honest with yourself this is where
you're oversimplifying off nice guys
finish last that's why you broke up with
me you just can't handle someone being
nice to you and treating you how you
deserve to be treated and blah blah blah
whatever else their little fucking
speeches motherfucker no I broke up with
you because you haven't had a job the
entire fucking year we date it and
you're collecting unemployment it's like
having a baby man child boyfriend and I
can't afford you I found out you had a
gambling problem I found out you're
addicted to heroin it's hard to hang out
with you because you're always at your
mom's house cuz you live there you got
my best friend pregnant you tried to
have sex with my dog that one time
you're not even really that fucking nice
I can promise you that there is a
laundry list of reasons why that girl
either broke up with you or chose not to
date you or doesn't like you being nice
is like in another book it's not even on
the list it's not there
there is not a girl on the face of the
earth that doesn't like nice
people ah you know I really hate nice
people yes girls have it easy in terms
of understanding this because we're
sexually objectified so when you meet a
guy that you like and then you know you
meet his really good-looking girlfriend
you're just like huh fuck god damn it
shit piss fuck you don't hear us moping
around about how nice we are and how
good we can cook sandwiches and shit
no by saying the nice guys finish last
it's a fucking cop-out way to not get
responsibility for any of the reasons
why a girl might not like you you can
finish first all day every day all the
time for the rest of your life if you'll
just find someone that likes the same
stuff as you do you have shit in common
with it you can fucking hang out with
don't use this nice guy thing as a
crutch for you to stand on all right be
a man
you gotta stop forcing relationships if
someone doesn't want to be with you then
they don't want to be with you just be
like cool so you never buy I know it's
hard to find someone that you like and
that likes you back and that you can
hang out with and be yourself around but
if it was easy there won't be any fun
and then you wouldn't learn anything
about life either you'd be an idiot and
you also wouldn't know how awesome that
person is if you didn't spend a long
time fucking sawing through these
dickheads trying to find tell me a favor
don't ever make that excuse again just
be like you know what fuck I'm gonna
stop trying to have sex with people's
dogs and getting people pregnant you
know maybe I'll get a job and find my
own apartment and then I'll find a girl
that likes me what you do that that
milkshake will bring all of the girls to
the yard I promise you come here my
below you're moving the whole beauty all
