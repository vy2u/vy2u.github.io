now cuz I know it oh all right so I want
to do the no mirror makeup challenge for
a really long time but it seemed kind of
boring to me everybody shut up over
their dogs and you really want to do it
the way that it was so I wanted to come
up with a way that would make it a more
exciting and B that you could win at it
cuz I like winning so I did was make it
a game and you could play this with any
number of people you could even play
with boys if you trusted them to touch
your makeup but next time you're having
like a sleepover with your friends or
your like rained in snow it in whatever
you guys are bored can get yourself an
alcoholic beverage here of legal
drinking or you can get yourself a
caffeinated beverage but you're gonna
need a beverage it's a makeup and your
face so it's essentially just like the
no mirror makeup challenge you don't get
a mirror you can't see what you're doing
I've also combined the 5 minute makeup
challenge with it and a drinking game
I'm like a fun genius so if you're
playing in a group maybe everyone has
their own products or maybe everyone has
to share products and then that would
add the element of sabotage because then
you can throw things across the room and
hide them from other players or make it
a full-contact game you may be to allow
yourself more time if you want to play
sabotage mode so the rules are as
follows
you have 5 minutes to do your entire
face you're not allowed to use any tools
fingers only
it's a mascara or an eyeliner you're
allowed to use a pencil or a lipstick
but if it's other than that fingers only
no tools
that's cheating every time you pick up a
new product you must drink in between
I'm never drinking Bull because tits as
with any good game you get to sit around
and argue about who won at the end of it
you can either play a ranking score or
you can just judge each other on a scale
of one to ten and not the whole face
because everyone's gonna look like shit
ranked your features individually so you
can either play the ranking way where if
you're playing the four people you judge
each other's eyebrows so whoever did the
best gets a four and three gets the
second best two and one is the worst and
then you go from feature to feature add
them up whoever gets the highest score
at the end wins
or you could judge each other's feet
on a scale of one to ten and I think a
scale of one to ten work better in the
sabotage mode because if you are judging
lashes and no one gets two lashes
because you've all sabotage each other
then you all get a zero basically
whoever gets the highest score at the
end wins
so since I playing alone and with my
internet friends I would be judging
myself at the end on a scale of one to
ten on each of my features and you can
leave me in the comments what you think
my score was but I'm pretty sure it's
gonna be a fucking 100 or as close as
you get to that because fuck you guys
alright
so I'm ready for the five minute no
mirror makeup extreme fucking crazy ass
challenge I invented for herself so you
have some fun all right I'm gonna put
five minutes on my iPhone so when the
five minutes starts I'm gonna gun it

fucking drew it it really kills a lot of
time all right we're minute in four

I also really like forgot what my
eyebrow pencil in this pile so we're
gonna do our book right now I got it
they're just going to be black so may be
able to get less points for it but
fucking I didn't drink all right I mean
I feel like I have too much time right
now I really got way too much time I
have like a minute left like that seems
like a lot to tap it seems like I've
spent a little more time doing some of
it whatever don't judge me it just gives
me kind of a limit my eyelid is dry like
filling my brows a little more don't you
roll away from me motherfucker
whatever sorry I could feel mo I got it
I got it I got it I got it okay I mean
what else can I do
I mean nobody ever know hip has ever had
someone they had a lot of bronzer and
looks like you have a glowing tan you
look horrible except no one alright
let's get this into the waterline how
about that oh good liver all like I have
the bottom half my I can make up for it
now nothing drink it all oh it's just so
weird because your kids he coming it's
terrible
oh my god I got five seconds left what
can I go to one
good all right um
I'm now looking at my accomplishment um
first of all I did horribly at the
drinking rule
second of all may I point out that this
came out I think a little better than my
drunk makeup tutorial which is
impressive because I am NOT drunk I was
just drinking I mean too shabby I mean
this looks better than some lunch ladies
I've had for sure
so now I'm nurse for myself feel free to
also score me in the comments risk or 1
out of 10 look at myself at 8 for
foundation because it looks look pretty
solid coverage didn't miss any spots I'm
getting eight for that my bronzer I
think is like a 4 because you can see
clear finger marks and like they look
like doodoo skids on my face and I'm
going to give myself a 3 for my blush
and that looks like shit it looks like I
drove the crayon on - lets you lips I'm
gonna got like 10/10 for lips this is
what they look like what I do that like
I nailed that I nailed that shit for my
eyes let's just do eyes as a whole eyes
and then eyelashes will do eyes I'm
gonna say can a 3 and they look alright
feels like guys they don't look like
buttholes
and for lashes I'm gonna get myself a 1
because they aren't even they're not
close it showed eyebrows I think I think
I'm gonna get myself a negative one
because they are racist you know what no
you know I'm gonna give us a one I take
that back because they're in the correct
spot sort of you know they weren't like
up and above all over the place so
what's my score Nate was a 3 plus a
fuckin and remember with that score is
but I think it's like a 29
out of a possible 70 or so boys that's
pretty good right let's look at F
