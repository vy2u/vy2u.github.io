without further ado here is the not my
arms challenge would you look at the
time okay so first thing we're gonna do
is I'm gonna play with my hair it feels
so amazing yeah I like to brush it
forward because it gives it so much
volume and texture like to cover my eyes
while I'm doing it and use their hung
side I'm done brushing my hair all right
now I'm teasing way here because we want
it to be up in the air and doing it very
gently I'm grabbing a firm hold onto my
hair and I'm pulling sections out of my
hair and then I'm brushing it towards my
head look at the time oh my god late I'm
late I gotta keep going alright

not going to get it in any of my teeth
own just gonna shove it and back with my
mouth completely yeah

my hair a little bit I'm gonna get it
out of my face because it's been in my
face this whole morning

it in my hair and I'm gonna get a hair
on my face oh it feels good especially

reason okay what are we doing
oh we got some hairspray because I like
I like this hair do something feel like
it's getting me but I don't know oh

because sometimes your string is just
like you gotta get it on your head so
that's what happens I got some
foundation and no pumping through these
little amount into my hand and then
directly bump my forehead and also in my
hair oh my god why why no think of my

mostly touching when people come in my
mouth more and make sure okay just go my

time I got some sprays I want to set my
powder I'm gonna cover my eyes because I
don't want to set my eyes I'm going to
set my mouth okay pick some blush and
smelling it oh just gonna dab a little
bit in there stop how closely very
closely cheeks would usually never

the cheeks like my hair didn't I'm gonna
do my eyes I'm just gonna get some
eyeshadow on there and find my eye I'm
gonna close it and just get it on there
