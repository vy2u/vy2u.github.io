got here yesterday my hair is not Kawai
got here late last night and today we
wandered around a little bit did a
little shopping but we're still kind of
jet lag but it's awesome here I'm really
excited we're going out to dinner we
have some ramen and then we're going to
the robot restaurant which I played a
clip of in my learning Japanese video so
I am very excited and I can't wait
awesome to Tokyo let's go let's go have
some fun dinner vending and free
friendly ramen restaurant and I'm ready
we're on our way to the robot restaurant
amazing
apparently the street just gets naughty
or naughtier little excited for that
in a row lecture almost kicked us out I
just broke it yeah yeah got the elevator
to our cellblock
so tableful my friends
what is happening
where they ask you I'm excited though
but it looks like with all the lights on
I've never seen this all the way
things that we
just when we thought it couldn't get any
more time yeah
launching purple red Juliet do it
you're at the bunny cafe take our shoes
off like bunnies amid Wow there's just
like DSS and es games you bring my intro
got street coffee these are all the
rules okay this is the one I'm in a
struggle wit don't force the hugging
this is discriminatory if you can't read
you can't touch the red supposed to get
Crocs yeah oh let's skip that part so
you don't step into duty oh how am I not
gonna touch for hugging I'm gonna force
the hug you
Jenna
chills you so much
no this one just jumped up on Jenna's
lap oh my god
that was like the coolest thing I've
ever done
Ali who's helping us around Tokyo for
the most part had made sure that we went
to one apparently there's some ethical
issues with some of the cat cafes and
other because our cafe we've heard was a
little sad like they don't treat the
animals very well so we made sure that
we went to one that had a good
reputation for treating the bunny as
well because that's important when
you're petting bunnies you want them to
be happy to the cat again these are all
three games sleepyhead
my brother had a gerbil
come shooting out the cattle they want
oh my god sent to the grocery store and
I just found the biggest grapes I've
ever seen my way here's a banana for
scale or here's my hand for smoke they
even drank within the ring
I'll run into each other
so Ali that's been helping us out made
us these awesome cards that we put on
our phone Julian says like I can't eat
any wheat barley anything like that miso
soy sauce but I love eggs and mine said
something like I can't eat any meat or
it like definitely not any seafood like
a vegan and Rome has one mom has one
that says your says like I love
everything I said to Julian that he's
like a little dog waiting to be adopted
with his presence is part of it
I love chasing my ball and run around
the yard I love eggs you have any
dietary restrictions any visit Tokyo
definitely try and get someone to make
you a card
I'd say you're harder than mine like he
has a higher chance of getting like
sneaky wheat we want a sneaky wheat
strange I didn't think there was a lot
some begin rice noodles with vegetables
in size that look so good
hello there hello roam alone my favorite
crossing the giant intersection with no
real so at which direction you can cross
it's just like everything well why do
you love those Janice you love those
intersection I think it's because if I
follow the rules so much and I'm so
scared of authority that it feels like
like freedom is just cake but the only
thing that's been really difficult is
that I don't fully understand the rules
with touching the doors and calves like
I know you're not supposed to touch them
on the way in but then on the way out
you're like should I shut it should i
what should I do really want to show
this because I'm gonna open it right now
look Fonda's mmm like a sparkly
chapstick oh my god oh no

mistake
I thought was like a chapstick much not
like goo goo goo let them know it's
awful you don't have to do that good

from the little panel that was just one
of the most rewarding experiences of my
life I was so amazing

just really really cool and it was
really cool for people that don't speak
English to understand what I'm saying

really really really really really
magical and it's something I don't think
