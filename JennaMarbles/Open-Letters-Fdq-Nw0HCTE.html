not so I had a bunch of thoughts
floating around in my head I didn't know
what to do with them so I decided to
make them all open letters open-ended
put them out in the universe to things
and people so that everyone can hear
them just because usually open letters
are like kind of serious sometimes
though and my first open letter is dear
open letters like split up and take it
easy feel like replying if any of these
affect you feel free to go ahead so I
wrote all these down and I'm gonna read
them here we go this is really difficult
because I had my contacts then and my
glasses
dear person that walks their dog by my
house every day why is your dog
screaming like literally screaming I
don't know your life I don't know your
dog's life I'm not trying to judge you
guys but like what the fuck is going on
here and it's weird while he's walking
what's your problem dog
but dear Pokemon go you're so fun
and you're all I want to do I've met
more new people in the last week of my
life
that I have in the past year I don't
know if that's the saddest thing ever or
the most awesome thing ever
dear committee of Bradley California

a terrible idea I want my money back and

expensive because I didn't buy forever
stamps a long time ago when I should
have deer avocados you can still fuck

dear President Obama please share more
of your dog's bow and Sony's lives with
us especially bow he's the first dog you
should have a snapchat at the very least
you got a cycle in interns there like
every single season when anyone can run
that snapchat just designate an intern
to just hang out with Bo all day and

on Wikipedia that Bo can sit shake roll
over and lie down prove it
dear sorting hat Mary Potter I need to
get shorted you forgot about me dear son

planet because it feels reminiscent of
like a bad relationship we get depressed
when we don't see you and then when we
do see you you burn us and hurt our eyes
we literally need protection to be
around you that's messed up so I'm just
asking you are you sure you're supposed
to be here
because something doesn't seem right I
got burned today I got a poky burn I was
just going around mmm I got all good
bird no dear Internet sometimes I have
so much to say but I can't really say

place to put all of the things that I
want to say and it's here that's where
those things go I feel better now dear

with this system of making couches go
together this it never fucking works it

who listen dear Kermit not everything in
life requires crying if we go out in the
world and stand somewhere for a minute
you cry because you're bored you cry at
people for not paying attention to you
and then you run away when they try to
touch you it's like trying to pet a fish
you cry in the morning until I say good
morning to you it's exhausting it's been
six years of crying we get it
you're on an emotional roller coaster
called life but aren't we all do that
with your neck that was it that's your
letter go look look dear marbles can you

thank you I hope we can heal from this
dear peach I don't know how you got so
big you eat the same amount and get the
same exercise as the other two dogs and
I still feel really bad about the time
that lady fat shamed you with the park
she asked what kind of dog you were and
I said Italian Greyhound and she said oh
I've never seen a round one like that
before and I know it left a deep scar on
you I think just one hit that you're
healthy and I love you just the way that
you are okay and my last open letter is
something very special and exciting for
months people have been asking me one of
those things on your phone these I'm
finally
tell you they're called pop sockets and
guess what pop sockets was kind enough
to make me my own pop sockets and
they're available down I've been holding
out for the sacred forever and I could
value
I'm really sorry Chris these are my
friend Chris's pop sockets I'm gonna
take em off I put mine up there is a
carbon one of Marvel's one and a galaxy
Kermit in Marvel's for those of you that
haven't seen any of the snapchats or
videos or whatever where I'm holding
them you don't know what they are I'm
going to show you really quick so you
can just use one in the middle or you
can use two if you have a bigger phone
like me so you just stick it on there on
your case on your phone whatever you
want mine is on my case that holds like
my credit cards and stuff and so they go
in like this for when you want your
phone to be normal and then you can pop
them out my phone was a little smaller
this would be like a stand like this but
since my phone's big no it's like that
so this is how I play pokemon go there
pop saw gates that I'm so excited that
these exists so if you want them I'm
gonna put the link in the description
I'm so pleased with how they came out I
hope you guys really like them not only
now I'm telling you what they are where
to get them but you can also get Kermit
and marvels legs and Kermit marbles
galaxies and I know for those of you

year now like Jenna where's your merch

it's upside sided look at how cute that
is thank you so much pop stock is for
making these you make the world so happy

far as I know yes get on my level this

than my mom they also make little things
like this I don't know if they're in my
shop maybe I'll pop sockets but you can
just click your thing into your car too

channel I put out new videos every
Wednesday thank you for letting me make
a chilled-out video this week and not
