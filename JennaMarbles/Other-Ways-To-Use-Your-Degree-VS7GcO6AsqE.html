know that for a lot of you out there
recent college graduates or people with
degrees people that will soon have
degrees you're not always guaranteed a
job anymore which sucks and there are a
lot of people my age that can't find
work in their field they feel like they
want to college forever so their ass off
and they still can't get a job and that
sucks my booboo I hear you but you don't
have to let your degree just be a piece
of paper that sits around in your room

ways so I wanted to give you some things
that you could do with your degree so
that you can get your fucking money's
worth from that bitch so then further
ado here are some other ways to use your
degree makes a great shield cleans up
shit in seconds who needs noisemakers at
basketball games when you can have

pillow they make a snuggly blanket a
chair for your hem self use it as your
alarm clock it's an iPod that plays all
your favorite songs like what the fuck I

textbooks on eBay and loled it makes a
great drinking game make every time you
