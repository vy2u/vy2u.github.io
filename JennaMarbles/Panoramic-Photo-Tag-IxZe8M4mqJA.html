of it staying that way get fuck fuck I
really wanted to do a video that was
silly because it's silly for no fucking
reason like the way that the photobooth
fucking video made me laugh it's not
creative and it's not effective but most
people that have an iPhone have a
panoramic feature in their camera
don't try and figure out a way to make
it something other than a slideshow so
we're going to sit here and critique our
photos we're fucking dying laughing
we're taking a picture so it's pretty
fun here is the fucking panoramic tag
everyone is tagged get fucked I thought
that anybody thought you doing creepy
ass fucking dance you got like two quads
on your right leg
just see my toes you only have middle
fingers you don't have any finger what
do I hands is like a fucking bull a
raptor claw and the other ones just a
middle fucking singing oh you have giant
forms then your bicep is like your eyes
are like way too big for your face and
your chin comes to a complete point like
you could stab someone with your chair
yeah but would you do me yeah let me see
the legs yeah I look like a pelican I
have a gullet I'm carrying water supply
for the whole car ride in my gullet and
then your fucking arm appears out of
nowhere like you're fisting the car in
front of you I do like Falcon punch
through my chest if you like cover up
the like 11 pieces and the one that's
making eye contact my piece covers an
iron and it's looking directly at the
camera you Jane that girl it looks like
I have a mini Decorah hand coming out of
my neck and then I have three sideburns
on my right ow my eyes where is that
hand coming from at the bottom oh you

garden gnome

girls bathroom last meal I had was

I'm jeanna the friendly human centipede
and I'm the creepy guy photographing you
at a kids playground when you move last

weird it's like a layer of skin that
just folds over my mouth it's like your
face is on circumcise would be okay hard

panorama picture I am a hater Kermit was
a centaur and then one day he just think
I'm done he pops up if you want to
to be honest he's got incredible balance

dogs that lost their back legs and do
some blocks forever up right but how
