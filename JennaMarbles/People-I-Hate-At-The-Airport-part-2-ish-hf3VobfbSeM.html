you guys miss it I put my computer on a
stack of napkins spoiler alert it didn't
work so today's video is going to be
continuation of bitches we're at the
airport and it's going to be all the
other people that I didn't even get to
mention in that video how much I hate it
because I was so busy talking about
bitches and their fashion choices but
today I want to address the rest of the
population that I hate at the airport so
yes this video is gonna be a rant and if
you don't like those you should click
away
like right now okay hey friends that
like to bitch about things that make you
angry in the world how are you hopefully
I will remind you of some people that
you've forgotten how much you hate
because I don't even travel that much
because I don't like to leave my furry
children but somehow I always seem to
run into these people every single
fucking time that I'm at the airport
first of all the people that I hate the
most on the airplane are the ones that
are trying to jam their giant fucking
bags in the overhead compartments I have
so many problems with this I fully
accept that maybe I'm the crazy one
because never ever ever brought more
than like a backpack on to a plane ever
let me tell you something unless you're
travelling like one day and then back or
like overnight I do not trust any girl
that only brings a carry-on suitcase you
know why because you can't bring any
girl shit like your fucking face wash
some sunscreen you're fucked you're at
the limit like you can't pray anything
more than that forget about makeup the
toothpaste mascara fucking anything that
you need I do not trust girls that are
like yes is mildly bad I'm just gonna
carry it on what kind of girl are you a
woman I'll trust like literally when I
pack my suitcase half of it is like
makeup and toiletries and fake tan and
the other half is like a couple of
shirts and shit and lay some pajamas and
a stuffed animal it takes up so much of
my bag all of the liquids and gels and I
need to bring I could never ever be able
to condense it and do the number of
ounces that they allow you to bring on
which is why I'm very confused where all
these people are going business trips
sure but then you also sort of what kind
of business eat right no most of these
people do not look business eat they're
just carrying a rolling suitcase onto
the plane because you're a jerk oh man I
want all my things what if I want my
league laptop and me whenever I need my
stuff out of all the people that bring
those rolling suitcases and a purse and
they're all their shit how many of them
when the flight takes off and is in the
air actually get up and get something
out of there fucking rolling suitcase
none of them none of them do and the
worst is when you get off the plane and
you see them take that like that's their
carry-on and then they go and get their
other checked bags figure your life out
get a bag that can go under your seat
Blake you know what Jenna I'm not gonna
brain anymore that can fit in this bag
because that's just fucking and
considerate to everyone when we're
getting on the plane we have to stand
there wait oh you jam it into the thing
and like walk back and forth up the
aisle looking for things that are open I
don't think I've ever ever been on a
flight with fled ten didn't have to come
around village listen everyone all right
so I'm just gonna have to check their
bag because we don't have any more
overhead compartment space so you know
this is gonna happen you're being a
selfish asshole because you want to
bring your fucking shoes and a change of
clothes and your jewelry and your laptop
and whatever else that you don't need or
even when you win what you have such
important valuables that you need to put
in a giant suitcase to bring on plane
where are you going last time I checked
we want to fucking New Jersey where are
you going New Jersey that you need that
know where the next people that I hate
in airports are the ones that are in
such a big fucking hurry to get on and
off the plane you know and they're like
oh we're sitting Section C now and
everybody fucking loses their mind and
goes and gets in fucking line to get on
the plane and then you know what they do
they go and they stand in that little
fucking tunnel to get on the plane but
all the assholes are jamming their bags
in the overhead compartments and we all
know they're in such a hurry because
they want to fight each other to make
sure their big soup bag gets up in the
big stupid fucking compartment you know
what I like to do
planned ahead and not like an asshole I
like to just sit in my fucking seat and
wait until everybody's gone and like I
guess I'll go on get on the plane now
and it's the same thing when the plane
lands like literally the plane lands it
turned off the fasten seat belt side
ever gets up oh my god like they're in
this giant race to get off the plane you
know that you're not getting off the
plane they're not gonna open that door
for another five to ten minutes at least
where are you going right now sit in
your seat and we're just on the plane
for what six hours you can't wait in the
five minutes before you start fucking
pushing children all the way so that you
can get off the plane now sit your ass
down the other people I hate are people
to take up both of their arm rests you
know that we have to share arm rests
here you can't have two it doesn't work
like that
I'm almost always in a middle seat
somehow this person taking up this
armrest and this person taking up that
armrest and I'm just like that girl
that's sitting you're like I guess you
guys fucking lucked out I have a nice
person and not another dude that would
just go like this and that's people that
piss me off on planes you know you're
like try to get comfortable and you're
taking off your shoes or whatever and
that's really fun cuz you're like making
yourself a little nest and you see me
playing like oh well comfortable but
then when people get a little too
comfortable and then all of a sudden
like half of their clothes are off and
they're walking around barefoot like
into the bathroom and stuff like bro
gross like really gross I don't want to
see the feet I get your feet away from
me they aren't even in socks like get
them away from me the next people that I
hate are the business people that sit in
first class and business class you know
before the plane takes off you have that
little bit of time to get settled and
they're all on their fucking phones
trying to like out business each other
buhbuh business blah blah business a
blah blah you're like oh hey guess what
we're in a small enclosed space so if
you could just shut the fuck up that
would be fantastic I mean I know that
you're so fucking important and stuff
like that I made that really clear that
you know no one's that important like
nobody if Oprah was on this plane right
now she'd be kicking it fuck yourself
the next people have had on airplanes
they're those fucking dickheads that
open their laptop and start playing
music just fucking loud like for the
entire plane to hear like it just
violates my ears that I have no choice
but to listen to
until someone tells you shut it off oh I
didn't know we're gonna listen to
muffled Skrillex from like three rows
back the entire play oh we are all this
order dude oh there's nothing I can do
about it oh cool also they have egg
phones like in the front pocket puts
them on and stop it I might be listening
to Winnie the Pooh book on tape least
I'll make you listen to it and the last
people I want to talk about are entitled
people with babies so sometimes when you
go to check your bag the line for it is
kind of long Lee sometimes you're in it
for half hour 45 minutes but that's part
of the reason why you get to the airport
early is because you're not an asshole
when you come prepared sometimes people
are late that's really understandable go
on with your bad self like get in front
of me who cares but on more than one
occasion I've literally waited in a
giant line standing there waiting
waiting waiting nobody likes to wait in
line I get to the front of the line oh
wait here comes affluent white lady
bitch in her fucking khaki skirt and
pearl necklace with her way to
good-looking husband and clearly their
first and only child all the way up to
the front of the line and you know what
these people more than once
have said oh yeah we're traveling with a
baby so can we just like check in now
and I'm like looking back in line at all
of the responsible not asshole families
with babies you know they got all their
fucking diaper bags and they're like
strollers and all their shit waiting in
line their kids crying he's hungry he's
pulling on their hair and like earrings
and these people are looking at these
fucking bitches like you got to be
fucking kidding me like if you have a
baby that means you get to get on the
plane early and like do things like that
it doesn't mean that you get to bypass
any and all lines completely disregard
the rules of the fucking airport just
because you have a fucking child like
really your babies just laying there
asleep in its stroller meanwhile fucking
regular responsible parent over here has
like three fucking toddlers they're all
fucking running all around the airport
they're like climbing on people's
luggage she doesn't get to budge the
line get off of your entitled high horse
get in line with everybody else I need
to end this video
because now I'm just getting angry and I
need to go you popsicle or something
feel electric again no scratch I found
my Kermit and I hugged him and now I
feel much better like half of the
world's disagreements could just be
solved by everyone just hugging a puppy
