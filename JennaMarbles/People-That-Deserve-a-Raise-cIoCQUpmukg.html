hi if you're wondering where I am I'm
just in the other bedroom in my house
because I'm moving out of this fucking
bitch soon and I'm like I've never shot
a video in here so might as well get my
money's worth this week I wanted to make
a video about some wonderful fucking
people in the universe my friend Brett
tweeted a particular person that
deserved a raise and I agreed so I want
to make a video this week about people
that deserve a fucking raise and I'm
only talking about like teachers
everybody agrees deserve a raise
I'm talking about exceptional customer
service from people that just deserve to
get paid higher than they do they go
above and beyond to give you the best
experience possible I wanted to
highlight some of those people in this
week's fucking video I should give
myself a ring first person that deserves
a raise is the cashier at a grocery
store when they're bagging your
groceries and you went and picked out a
nice little pack of gum for yourself
mm-hmm some of that fucking did teen I
don't know what kind of gonna be like
baked bread you're all pumped eat your
gum and you know what they do they dad
all your groceries and then they take
that fucking pack of gum and they hand
it to you because they know you want it
right now that person deserves a fucking
raise because they'll put in the back if
you wanted your gum in the back you
would've bought package of gum and the
gum aisle and you didn't do that you've
got a single package you want to eat it
now and they realize that that's called
customer service that person deserves a
raise median salary for someone that's
fucking working as a cashier at a
grocery store around $28,000 a year
guess how much money they should be
making a faint Andrew your fucking pack
of gum $100,000 a year no less you're
amazing outstanding and
fan-fucking-tastic and I appreciate you
the next person that deserves a raise is
your childhood school bus driver my
school bus driver when I was a kid his
name was Julio I think I walked like 15
or 20 houses to the corner in the
streets was a pick
buddy up there and I don't you ever been
to like upstate New York there's a lot
of fucking snow it's really cold and
really miserable it was kind of a far
walk to the corner
okay you know what Julio would do for me
he would fucking pick me up in my house
sometimes on the way back from school he
would drop me off in my house Julio even
gave me a nickname okay he called me
Kawana and it was fucking awesome it was
like our secret code names for each
other
I called him bus driver he called me
Guana Julio deserves a fucking race
newer the man median salary first school
bus drivers around $30,000 a year you
need $300,000 a year
Julio that's what you fucking deserve
the next people that deserve a raise are
people that work in convenience stores
on my convenience store of choices
7-eleven and I tweeted this the other
day that I realized that I'm not a
regular anywhere except for 7-eleven and
those people are fucking fantastic and
at first I thought I was only like
friends with one guy that worked there
until I slowly started to realize that I
know everyone that works there and
everything one of them knows me I'm
guessing it's not too hard to identify
someone with purple hair I get the
fucking same thing all the time
and if I don't get it for some reason
that day they're like oh dude what
you're missing your stuff where's the
rest of your stuff like you get a banana
and fucking did you want some 5-hour
energies you're in here like every
fucking day back 5-hour energies and
fucking Red Bull and shit did you need
some caffeine Jenna where's like ah no
but thanks for remembering but no I mean
you can even extrapolate that idea on
anyone where you're regular and they
remember your order you know not because
the computer tells them but because they
see a beautiful fucking face and they
choose to remember and choose to have
fantastic fucking customer service even
at a 7-eleven they make around $30,000 a
year I think that they should make
ninety nine thousand dollars a year it
would be an even hundred except they
don't deliver so I'm taking off
and for that they make $99,000 here from
now on the next people that deserve a
raise are the wonderful people that work
in doggy daycares now to paint you a
picture the place where I take permanent
marbles and soon-to-be peach is like
this glass enclosed room and I don't
think that they explicitly take little
Donuts but there's only ever little dogs
in there and you know what it sounds
like fucking hell
like just barking and yipping and
yipping I love dogs and it sounds like
hell in there like miserable and there's
a glass wall that looks out under the
street so they just fucking lose their
shit a hundred percent of the time all
day they fucking walk them they feed
them and then to top it all off they
write you an adorable little fucking
report card about what your dog did that
day like parents don't even get that
further fucking kids sometimes certainly
not on a daily basis and this is your
fucking dog those people make less than
$20,000 a year they should be making
$50,000 a year per dog but every single
time a dog barks you should be fucking
$50,000 in my pocket - change - change -
change - chink that's what it sounds in
the dogs bark cash the next person that
deserves a raise is when you go to the
movie theater and you get some popcorn
and they're like do you want some butter
and you're like well yeah fuck yeah why
not I don't go to the movies often and I
certainly do not get popcorn often but
when I do I want it to be fucking
awesome I don't want it to suck so the
person that deserves a raise and that
fucking establishment is the person that
fills the bag up halfway
pumps butter into it fills the rest of
the popcorn up and pumps butter on it
again you my friend oh my god it's so
thoughtful it's so caring like I don't
just want buttery delicious and it's not
the top of my popcorn I want it all the
way through my popcorn so that the end
of my popcorn is just as good as the
beginning of my popcorn but you don't
put too much on that is a
gets weird and then your hands are all
gross and I forgot a napkin
fuck you make it fantastic and I
appreciate you and you deserve fucking
raise that person that works that
concession stand is probably making
around $18,000 a year
I googled all these by the way for some
fucking scientist hmm I think the person
that does that should make the same
amount of money as the highest-grossing
film that year so like 350 million
dollars that's what that one dude that
one concession stand to make 300 fucking
million dollars guys it's a logic okay
trust me the next person I think
deserves race is flight attendants that
make jokes now I really don't like
flying
and my favorite one we just take it off
and I don't really like taking off
because you get like nervous and as soon
as the fucking wheels took off the
ground this motherfucker
picks up the phone it goes even hangs up
nose like yes thank you for making those
of us that are terrified of flying feel
that much better because clearly you're
having great fucking time at work today
and user fucking raised median salary of
someone that's a flight attendant is
about $60,000 a year thanks for making
69 thousand dollars a year get it for
making jokes they get 69 thousand
dollars and the last people that deserve
a raise are strippers that do tricks now
I don't really go to strip clubs that
much but when I do I sit right in front
of the state all I want to do is just
see some fucking Swimmer tricks I want
to see twirls split I want to see all of
it Everage salary maybe like $40,000 a
year for a stripper strippers that do
tricks should start fucking base hot
attack $100,000 just for fucking showing
up with their artistry because that's
what they are
okay they're artists they're athletes
and then on top of that they should get
paid 50 cents every time that they climb
all the way up to the pole and 50 steps
every time they do a fucking split and
then 50 cents of every single time that
they go like one rotation around the
pole and it should be multiplied by a
degree of difficulty and then it should
be a sport in the Olympics so they're
basically making like 7 million
and the only Olympic athletes that get
paid when they walk in and they get tips
while we're doing it because they're
hazards right they're fucking like the
dollar bills so you ever seen strippers
it's like trying not to slip on all
their dollar bills it's part of the
sport you have to avoid avoid the dollar
bills guys some really good ideas okay
I'm gonna idea person smells so weird
you smell like a puppy
a peach are you getting bigger picture
are you going to end growl anyways yeah
those are people that I think deserve a
raise and deserve some fucking credit
for being fantastic human beings at work
like they just show up to fucking light
the day up and I want to commend you and
highlight you and tell you how much I
appreciate you I swear not being creepy
this is just what I'm doing with my head
hey PG oh oh good yawn honey you say

plated in a perfect world it's what I
