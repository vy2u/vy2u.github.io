a shot since it looked so cute I'm
Jillian last week I realized I've never
explicitly made a video that said people
that I hate I've made one called people
that I hate part two ish I get airports
people that I hate at the gym but I want
to just fucking let's make this a thing
people that I hate loose in general you
guys are always asking me like hey Jenna
make a rant like you're essentially
saying Jenna we want you to shit on
people this week is that week my friends
I've been keeping a little tab in my
phone of some people that I hate for you
so that I can shit on them on the
Internet apparently you guys like me
when I'm either drunk or angry so I
think that says a lot about you anyways
here's the people that I hate the first
people that I hate are people than this
pronounced words not like slang and not
like you said something wrong one time
just because you mispronounce it I'm
talking about really normal words that
people say wrong repeatedly because
they're too lazy to figure out the fact
that they sound like a fucking idiot if
the following words ever come out of
your mouth there is a chance that I hate
you instead of probably you say the word
prolly like a fucking trolley of
probability fuck you instead of espresso
you say expresso not a coffee train it's
not an expresso okay it's a fucking
drink instead of picture you say picture
like someone that throws a ball in
baseball or that hold your fucking Wat
it's a picture picture I'll take picture
for a thousand Alex
instead of library you say library
that's acceptable in two scenarios
you're in kindergarten or Never
or in some off chance that you're eating
a fucking bush with berries on it called
Bligh berries there's no such thing as a
lie Barry what are you doing after class
I'm just gonna go to the library fuck
off
instead of especially you say especially
I would expect that you shut the fuck up
after you say that fuck you I also hate
when people pronounce the word police
wrong it's pigs I'm just kidding thank
most of you for your service
the next people that I hate are people
that complain about the weather just
move or shut the fuck up you act like
you didn't know it was gonna get cold or
it was gonna get hot it happens every
single year every year winter happens
and summer happens you fucking hamster
when it's hot you complain when it's
cold you complain year-round you're
complain
it's not even about the weather anymore
at that point you're just a complainer I
suggest that you find a climate that
suits you maybe in a remote area with no
internet connection I think would be
preferable to all of us on social media
watching you complain about how it's
fucking cold again no shit it's cold
fucking hamster and off your wheel move
or shut the fuck up people in New
England called their winter storms a
nor'easter first time I heard that I was
like this sounds demonic a nor'easter
used to be called a northeaster until
the first people that I hate that can't
pronounce words decided to start
complaining about the weather and made a
perfect storm called a nor'easter the
next people that I hate are people that
get mad at babies like when you're on an
airplane and there's somebody upset that
there is a baby crying oh what'd you
think you were like a silent baby that
bet itself and raised itself and never
got upset about anything bullshit plus I
guarantee you that mother is ten times
more upset then you will ever be get a
pair of headphones like everybody else
and the next time you're in public
crying really loudly cuz you just figure
it out what a shitty person you are I
hope an old man comes up to you and
yells at you for it the next people that
make me really angry are the ones that
get mad at women for breastfeeding in
public without covering their breasts
because they think it's inappropriate or
offensive even though it's completely
legal everywhere at least in the United
States
you people are fucked up it's beautiful
it's natural it's healthy and not to
mention boobies this is America the land
built on freedom and boobies and
people's freedom to do things with their
boobies and how dare you be a boobie
hater pimple with boobs doing things
with their boobs and their babies and
boobs grow up and boobs boobies boobies
boobies boobies look I know along the
same lines I really don't understand
people that say I hate kids I hate you
how can you hate kids kids are just tiny
humans that only want to have fun what
you're essentially saying is that you
hate fun you're a fun hater oh you don't
like kids huh well kids don't like you
either cuz you're not fun you're wet
Grinch salad on a sidewalk that's
getting really hot and disgusting with
no fucking dressing you don't like
fucking Ferris wheels and cotton candy
liar the next people that I hate are
people that use social media platforms
for something other than their intended
purpose
like for example when you go on
someone's snapchat story and the whole
thing is just telling you to go check
out their YouTube videos or vine and
then when you get to their vine it's
telling you to go to their Instagram do
you understand what you're doing you're
being the Where's Waldo of snapchat you
are being the Carmen Sandiego of the
Internet I don't know where the fuck to
find you bitch
and I'd also like to point out that you
are being the my mom of social media
stop telling me to go places you think
someone sat down and designed a
beautiful snapchat geofilter so that you
can scribble your shitty youtube user
name all over it then no one can even
read or click on because links don't
work in snapchat no the next people that
I hate that are really bugging me right
now because it is December are people
that won't stop taking the holidays to
the next level like this person who
can't seem to just wear a dress made out
of not trees she can't even wear a dress
made out of dress most of us are happy
with a little bit of time with our
families some decorating I don't know
some seasonal baking if you're feeling
really crazy but know this girl is over
here turning yourself into a Christmas
princess for like a fucking month don't
forget to water yourself and permanently
get lost on your way over to my party
with your backward-ass priorities or
like how this used to be festive but now
this is festive I just have so many
questions is there a show called
Christmas things hoarder that you can go
on do you have a storage unit to keep
all of these things in for the other 11
months of the year because I know that
doesn't all fit in your house okay you
must though right so can you store
yourself in it I don't find this to be
festive at all I find it hostile the
next people I hate are people that live
tweet television shows that ended months
ago no no one is with you do not live
tweet season 1 episode 1 of Breaking Bad
while demanding no spoilers from
everyone its clogging up my feed and
frankly my brain as far as I'm concerned
the only person that's allowed to do
that is like a boy that was raised by
wolves that just got Netflix and an
iPhone today you can tweet away because
that is hysterical but everybody else
the next people that I hate are people
that asked how much you paid for
something at a completely inappropriate
time or that isn't even your friend I
love your dress
how much did you pay for that
the next time someone asked me that an
inappropriate time I'm just gonna say
that I painted sex I've fun wasting your
money fuck because it's stupid the next
people that I hate are people that turn
small talk into giant diarrhoea talk for
example I checked into a hotel recently
and had a conversation something like
this
oh where are you guys coming from Los
Angeles Oh what brings you here work how
long do you staying
I don't know it should be right in bring
your face in checking into a hotel oh
where are you guys going I mean what are
you gonna be doing yeah weird what's
your favorite television show oh I'm
sorry I didn't know that an interview
was part of checking into a hotel I
didn't send in my resume I didn't even
apply and if you keep going I'm just
gonna start answering your questions
with questions where are you guys coming
from well where are you coming from well
I came from my house to work and I work
here where do you work I don't know
where do you work I work here I'm right
here yeah but where's here fuck with me
it's a perfect defense or people that
turn small talk into like diarrhea
therapy dump time oh hey man how's it
going
oh not good dude up I can't just blew up
and my uncle Larry just called me from
jail and maybe you're confused okay this
conversation that we're having right now
is like a it's like a polite formality
and I am NOT a toilet please don't diary
on me your diarrhea and put it in a real
toilet I don't know what about my face
says toilet but please wipe leave and
never do it again these do not pee out
of your body onto my face it's exactly
what it sounds like just small talk nut
and the last people that I hate on the
KKK and terrorists and everybody else
like that fuck all y'all you got some
Cal Pelt dick so for those of you that
like when I shit on people I hope that
this video suffice because you're being
a piece of shit I'll shit on you and
I'll say shit like 12 times in a row
