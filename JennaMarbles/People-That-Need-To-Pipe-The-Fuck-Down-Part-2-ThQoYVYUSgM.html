lots of colorful and language go in way
if you did not like in colorful and
language there man what there me girl
like you but go big she's getting I wish
you would stop and growing and say
little forever
like mommy's lipgloss okay guys all gone
now bitch can't you share so I asked you
guys would you I see for me and
sometimes I make what you suggest and
sometimes I make whatever good God the
fuck I want to the weekend what you're
looking good boy without looking keep
watching maybe like a year more ago I
made a video called people that need to
pipe the fuck down which means uh
basically just get the fuck out of my
face and my life because you're just
ruining everything for everyone because
you suck ever since I uploaded that
video this is then one of the most
requested sequels like please make a
part two to this I guess you guys really
just want to know who I think needs to
pipe the fuck down because chances are
you think they need to pipe fuck down to
reaching your arm over the fucking
Chipotle glass you fucking dick I'm
talking to you here's some more people
that I think need to pipe the absolute
fuck all the way fuckin down or else I'm
gonna punch you square in your dick the
first people that need to pipe the puck
down are people that think that they can
touch you
anytime that they want without warning
and without asking pepper I think a good
example of this is pregnant people now
I've never been pregnant and I've seen
lots of times in the past
a pregnant stranger get just like
attacked by another stranger being like
oh my god how far along are you the
kickee is just a boy or girl you know
you need a pipe to fuck down and there's
another way to say that it's called get
the fuck off my fucking dick and get
your dick out of my mouth and put it in
your fucking your own mouth and then get
your dick out of my dick fucking leave
my baby alone understand that like for
some reason we're all drawn to babies
and like cute things and whatever but
that person is a total fucking stranger
and you're just putting your hand on
stomach if somebody did that to me in
public like that I didn't know and I
wasn't pregnant
that's the weird that's literally the
weirdest fucking thing in the world just
because there's a baby in there all of a
sudden you get to just put your hands
all over someone else's belly button and
ask it questions you need to fucking
stop it it's outrageously inappropriate
to touch pregnant people I mean have you
ever heard of a question you could ask
the person
hey pregnant stranger oh can I touch
your pregnant belly but then I mean you
always run the chance of that person
just not being pregnant at all and then
you're that asshole so when in doubt if
you don't know the person don't touch
their fucking stomach okay a pipe fuck
fuck fuck fuck down
pipe it fucking down down all the way
down and out like if I was pregnant and
someone tried to touch my belly they
like Oh what is it
fuck you pipe the fuck down don't touch
me you know what's funny is that people
think that they can touch your unborn
baby but when it's a child you get
arrested for touching them should be the
same way another thing that people seem
to think that they can touch without
asking without permission is your hair
if you're a guy in particular I feel
like like Julian with his fucking bun or
like Greg slop some gay with his
mustache people just seem to think that
they can come up to you and fucking
touch her exciting hair those people
need piped fuck down and keep the
motherfucking hands to themselves and if
you don't want to tell them to pipe the
fuck down you can say keep it in your
fucking pants get your hand off of my
hair and grow your own fucking hair
God Phil you're here that way another
thing I don't like that people put their
grubby little fucking fingers all over
are my dogs they don't say like hey
that's a really cute dog do you mind if
I pet them like a fucking adult they
just go up and I'm here oh so fucking
cute and then they lose their minds cuz
they're panicking they don't know who
the fuck you are you're a stranger so
Kermit and Peach for the most part will
let a stranger touch them although they
do get scared
Marvel's on the other hand is not having
any of it and he lets you know that he's
not having any
he makes the phase reusing and then
people still are like though it's okay
dogs love me and then they put their
fucking hand in his face sometimes when
I'm out in public and I'm walking Kermit
on the ground trembles really doesn't
like a lot of people and foot traffic
and things so I keep him in this
absolutely ridiculous doggy backpack so
I'll just be like walking around like
that that's it I'm just here with my dog
trying to keep him away from people and
like keep him up on my chest away from
you in particular and for some reason
it's like wearing a sign on my chest
that says touch me grab me fucking put
your fingers in my mouth like whoo when
the actual fuck taught you how to
interact with animals you're that person
that gets mauled by a grizzly bear
because you think it's cool and fun to
like feed him and shit like you're
you're an idiot
so marbles is sitting in my backpack
right and I can't tell you how many
people go up to him to discuss I guess
that kid I'm like you don't he's gonna
bite you I'm not gonna feel bad because
you're supposed to ask to touch just
think of the world as a giant fucking
museum okay you can't just go around and
touch the exhibits because you have
heads the following is for
demonstrational purposes only
I deserve to Julian to make mottled mat
by waving his hand in his face so that
you can see what it looks like when
Marvel says please bitch please do not
fucking touch me and pipe the actual
goddamn goddamn down it looks like this
this says do not touch me bitch that's
what you fucking get the next people
that need to pipe the fuck down Julian
was walking marbles the other day and
this woman came up to him and said oh
that's such a little chihuahua it's a
teacup and Julian politely said no he's
not a teacup because for those of you
that have no fucking idea what that
means it's basically just a marketing
ploy a chihuahua is a chihuahua they say
teacup so that you'll buy them because
you think
they're extra little that's it they're
all fucking genetically the same okay
it's a dog called a chihuahua there's no
such thing as a breed of teacup
chihuahua yeah but he's really little
like he's so much littler than mine yeah
he's the teacup
he's easy Dinka he's a teacup you know
what lady you're gonna tell me when I
fuck it out you can pipe the fuck down
and you can get fucked just imagine that
okay you're walking your dog and it's
clearly I don't know a boxer and someone
comes up to you and says is it Shepherd
isn't he he's a shepherd nice fucking
alpaca are we speaking the same language
not a teacup piece of thank God not a
teacup all I can say is a think up but
it's so precious the teacup dopey eats
your face all you sleep the last people
that need to pipe the fuck down are the
people that won't stop saying that the
iPhone six spins now I would just like
to unpack this for a second we're just
gonna throw an idea out there okay
anything's for bending if you bend it so
in theory your laptop might fucking Bend
if you bend it I don't know man that
laptop looks nice but uh you know it
bends if you bend it oh no shit be in
fuck better don't fucking return it damn
it
is that the new Apple watch man I heard
those things are great except for the
fact that if you throw it into a fucking
volcano
it'll melt you might want to reconsider
that one and get your money back because
mmmm things not melt through thin you
animate oh hey man isn't your mug great
mug but I heard that it breaks if you
Hulk smash it into your toilet at work
yeah you better be careful that your kid
hey you know I heard that if you slide
him into a pit full of gorillas they
might rip all the limbs off of his body
second generations always better they
get all those like weird defects out of
the first one so you might be able to
slide that one into a
Gorillaz but this first one mm-hmm and
might get dismembered like it's
literally the stupidest fucking thing
ever I don't have the new iPhone 6 yet
but Julian has the new iPhone 6 and
literally every single fucking person
that has seen him he's not all good like
I heard that it bends is your spending
did it Bend is it look bending it all I
don't know man here why don't you
fucking bend it fuck you
so this has been brought to people that
need to pipe the fuck down there's many
many more by the way I'm moving out of
this place in a couple of weeks thing is
