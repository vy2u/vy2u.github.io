hear like dying laughs but she was like
choking like vehemently and then she
just started laughs that was an
incredibly juvenile video and I made it
purely because someone suggested it and
it made me laugh out loud and this video
made me laugh out loud so I think a
mission accomplished I would say I think
so and guys if you're it's a concept to
a job you don't have just get creative
and you know don't be afraid she laughed
at that when I said I don't want to come
in just cuz I don't want it just in case
I don't wanna go because I don't have
options because you like might wake up
and want to come in but you want to have
you wake up and don't want to come in
hope you like this video a little bit
different not something I would usually
do probably not something I'm gonna do
again I feel like a little bad yeah me
too
like dear people that pull pranks on
other people for a living how do you
remove yourself of guilts because I'm
having a difficult time and we only call
it a few people make sure you subscribe
to a channel I put out new videos every
Wednesday and I had fun doing something
different so I hope that you liked it
and if you hate it then let me know and
I'll never fucking do it again bye pray
for me she said she would pray for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
