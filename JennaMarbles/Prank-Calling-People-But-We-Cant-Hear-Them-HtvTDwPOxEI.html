us to do all the time
prank call places we don't work at and
call in a sec yeah because we did two of
those unfortunately we did ten he really
did I'm not cut out for pranks I just
feel really guilty the whole time but on
the training page the other day we saw a
video by Hamish &amp;amp; Andy's it was called
having a conversation without listening
basically what they did is that one
person can hear is a conversation but
the person that can't hear has to have
the conversation so Ukraine called his
mom the guy responding to his mom can't
hear it she's saying the other guy sort
of mind them what's going on so I feel
like maybe we'll feel less bad if we're
calling complete strangers like the
