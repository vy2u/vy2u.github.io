baby we shall be asking ourselves why
someone by the name of Kalyan news
tweeted this beautiful picture of her
gluing on just a bunch of fake nails to
one finger and it said she thought of me
while she did it I felt so inspired by
this picture there is nothing else for
me to do once I have been filled with
this inspiration I need to know what the
longest actual finger nail measurement
is and we need to beat that 30 foot oh I
don't know if we can beat that oh okay
we can do that oh yes we can I bought
four hundred bills this is just
something that when I see a picture like
that I have to do this this is what my
purpose in life is to just see how long
I can make a finger nail it's like
polished Mountain but for length I don't
know I have Jesus Jesus is making me do
this story Tut so it looks like in this
picture she has like small little fake
nails like they're not very big and some
of them are black like the only ones
that I got we're the ones that you are
straight-up meant to glue onto your nail
bed and like create a nail with so I'm
gonna do a fuck ton of these together
hopefully they're a little longer than
those the only thing I did not account
for is that these all come in different
shapes so like it could get a little
wonky
I like the thumb because hers got real
curly which i think is an elegant look
oh my god super yes Julian it's super
hot glue its nail glue no one make fun
of my finger or the fact that I like to
pick at it y'all can fuck off so the
first thing we need a nice strong base
so I'm gonna cover this in glue
look like a funny
yes me they work on nail that's what I
like I like that aesthetic it's my
aesthetics just weird you have to hold
each and every one of these yeah
oh my fucking what how do I get it to
curl like in a different direction look
it it's gonna curl straight away and
whatever I done am i messed up already
gonna offset like this don't be careful
the glues not dry and that hurts my
finger don't come in here with your Ares
bullshit no no no no no this is gonna be
very subtle it's not gonna be a Aries
right-hand turn delete delete delete
people look at the internet like oh it's
just a place for dumb shit yeah you
fucking right it is they're all coming
apart my vision here let me help
it looks like it's also asking me why
you're doing this you think so
so we're gonna try hot glue oh my god
Julia my finger oh this is gonna be
hairy now this is ugly boy Oh Julian the
last two look like shit I don't have a
meltdown I'm melting down we have to
nail glue okay this doesn't work these
are all wasted can we reuse them you
have 400 nails yeah but I like these
ones
well the nail glue takes like a minute
to dry each time okay I mean we know he
kept going he's looking down every
single part of my hand is gonna be
covered in they'll go after this getting
a little concerned cause it's starting
to curl back into where we just were but
we did figure out that since the nail
glue takes like fair amount of time to
dry what's better is if we do them like
this on the side and then try it we'll
glue them in like this oh is that it's
me noodle hey bitch see the nail glue is
so much better than all this one's
coming apart by the way thank you to
everyone that attended my hair wraps
funeral which was live on Twitch I did
take my hair up out it did take a while
it was very sad but I am so appreciative
that all of you were there to have its
funeral with me it was a beautiful
service
Julian played Spice Girl say we'll be
there at my funerals after-party for my
hair wrap which I found to be a little
insensitive but I know your heart was in
the right place y'all bitches can't even
spell acrylic y'all but just can't even
look really look at this the clear ones
that I bought have like a different
curvature than the white ones they don't
really stick because they're too flat so
there's a gap between the white ones and
the clear ones so we might be limited to
like these 200 nails which is
disappointing from our world record but
like I don't think we're gonna be able
to get those ones this is just a lot of
like sitting here and letting it dry
it's a lot of sitting here welcome to my
spelling tutorial a/c are a pal
okay acrylic I told you I can spell it
this is really fulfilling a lot in my
soul to have it be this long I feel like
one of those people it just walks around
like this and that's their life I love
it it's like an inner tube but it's
glamorous but it's beautiful it's
falling apart this sound I love that
sound of just fucking fake as hell
you're sick this is like incredibly
painstaking to glue all of them together
hangs taking a sort of a general theme
of your ideas it looks like a high-end
waterslide it looks like something I'm
holding it doesn't look like part of my
fingernail master past
five minutes into acrylics then she
gives you this book don't not do not get
under your hair it's gonna curl a knot
as you're gonna tangle it done I guess
I'll be using that hand oh shit I can't
press the home button it's not
functional yes it is okay I can't take a
picture with it but at least I have my
other hand it's the fashion nail okay
we're getting pretty small these are
like the pinky nails right there's not
too much to film here aside from us just
sitting here gluing nails together like
we're gonna do almost two boxes which is
like 200 nails but like when you put
them all together like this that doesn't
really look like that many one two three
four five six seven eight who do we
appreciate this man I know
so I dab a little glue in there and then
I take the next tip and I sort of just
like press it down
the right song alright put your phones
away and unsubscribe the show like I
feel like we've spent so long doing this
and it's like this is impressive but
like it's not a live show this is like
my eyes hurt like there's a lot of glue
like it's just this is amazing this is
the nail version of claymation you work
hours and hours for like three seconds
or something
stop shooting up straw it's like
actually make me a little nauseous I was
like bothering something to eat it
go see show them suck it down what did
you just threaten a non-existent child
to leave them in Anaheim Bree ruff you
see how long this takes to do like one
nail at a time are you ready oh the
final reveal it looks only slightly
different than the last time you said
didn't it well what do you think I know
it really doesn't look like that many
but it took forever for anyone that's
ever use nail glue like it's like how it
is really it really does take a long
time to dry each one and this is I was
like probably just short of two in her
nails who's going through two boxes but
did have a fair amount of casualties do
the hot glue nail tour like we did it
from largest down to the smallest nail I
think it gives it a beautiful natural
effect
I'd say that this is very my nail my
nail Bella imagine seeing this it's
almost like oh my nail all right
I'll be back in like 15 minutes it's
very dilute kid I have learned my lesson
aside from it just tragically breaking
Julian do like it yeah sick I'm
impressed with the length of it we had a
lot of casualties but this is legit two
boxes of nails
it's almost 200 fucking nails and it
took for fucking ever
it's a I made it yeah crew it's all very
natural every day I just takes so many
vitamins and it goes straight to my
thumb is a really fun slinky it's cause
for celebration
here we go
no no one's gonna take my GLAAD really
does it look like elegance yeah sure
how do you even approach a woman like
this this is too much woman for you way
too much what is creepy about this no
it's my first day with my nail look it
you can just hide stuff with it that's
amazing ladies you know some people in
life become doctors and lawyers and
other people push the boundaries of
nails and nail glue I'm an artist make
art I'm a fancy lady someday when I die
remember my accomplishments we've gotten
ourselves into deep set it and forget it
was this necessary know that I need to
do this no does anyone ever need to do
this no but I just wanted to see what
would happen because I was inspired from
Kalin on Twitter but this is as long as
I could get it without losing my
absolute fucking mind I only lost a
little bit it's about 200 nails and I
think it came out great see what happens
if you just punch it as hard as you can
all right ready
keep going oh yeah that's it make sure
you subscribe to my channel I put out
new videos every Wednesday / Thursday I
just broke it I broke it off my nails my
nail it had it anyways oh fuck bitch
I think it looks good and I'm
repurposing it that sounded like a
judgmental okay it was it was judgey you
want a bracelet Jim Jim your hand in
there no Julie and I thought you were
supportive I was it's over
brace yourself but not as braces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
