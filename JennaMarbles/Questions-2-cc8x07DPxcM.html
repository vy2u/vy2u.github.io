like something I came with overnight um
I have been playing this for a little
while
I've lived in Boston for seven years I'm
from Rochester New York so it's time for
me to I don't know I need a change a
change of pace a change of scenery
I've been out there a few times to visit
as a big con Rise of the Planet of the
Apes I was out there to visit um and
it's just I don't know I'm ready for a
change so I'm going out there and we are
driving in a car for the next 18 days so
I am leaving tomorrow but I will not get
there until September 11th uh
so I really just wanted to tell you guys
that's why for the next couple of weeks
I have no idea what my videos are going
to be like because I'm going to be in
car and you know adventuring across the
United States so if you're interested in
like the daily videos and stuff I'll put
all those on my blog channel obviously
pictures and everything like that will
be on my Facebook and Twitter um and the
next couple videos might be definitely
not me sitting in front of computer and
this is the last time we're going to be
sitting here so all I can say goodbye

spider-man will always be in the
background
Lois beauty but I will probably be out
in the world in the next couple videos
so wish me luck in if I don't post the
video next week it's because I crashed
my car and exploded or got mauled by
there make sure you subscribe to our
channel we put on new videos every
Wednesday and we are very very tired of
packing and I'm sorry this video is not
as exciting as they usually are but um
when you pack to move across the country
it's kind of a lot of planning and work
so I've been very stressed and busy so
yeah that's what's going on but I say
goodbye to everyone Boston and I'll miss
you and love you and if I hate it out
