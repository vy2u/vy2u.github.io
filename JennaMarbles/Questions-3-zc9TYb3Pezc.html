they're fighting alright just ignore any
licking and/or butt sex noises that you
may hear from the background and you'll
have to excuse my voice I lost it last
weekend because it was my birthday hey I
was yelling from excite me I was looking
back in my videos and I realized the
last time that I made a questions video
was over a year ago then I felt like a
dick because I haven't answered anyone's
questions in a fucking year so I asked
on my Twitter Facebook what's your
brooding questions were for me I think I
might actually try to answer some of
them this time the past two that I've
done I just kind of get bullshit answers
but I think of it a try a little bit
well we'll see how it goes I'm going to
read that bond my computer so if you're
wondering where I'm looking no it's not
your boobs just kidding it is it's on my
computer screen
thunderclap questions what's so exciting
right now tell the story of how you lost
your virginity that is an inappropriate
question but the answer is uh dated the
same guy for four years in high school
oops lol no more virginity can you flex
your boobs doesn't the right shirt and
or bra combination for that but yeah
kind of look at that buh buh just
happened so fast you can't can see it
when are you going to become mrs. max no
sleeves fucking why you guys want us to
get married so bad I already made a
whole video about getting married I told
you I'm the answer is a kind and
respectful don't thank you for quite a
while
so don't get your fucking hopes up which
way do you face in the shower I like to
face facing away from the water cuz if
I'm facing in too large is too much I'm
like drowning I can't breathe it sucks I
don't know how people do that do it for
like three seconds to rinse my face off
and then that's it I feel like my face
is burning when I put it under the water
like that not fun how do you feel about
pugs pugs are delightfully and
hilariously not good looking why can't
you love kitties like I love kitties let
me tell you a secret about me I actually
really do like sand
I really want to give you kitty don't
tell anyone it's a secret shut your butt
how often do you masturbate I'm not
gonna answer that what would you do if
max ever cheated on you kick him the
fuck out do you have a mole in an
embarrassing place Oh hold on okay well
it's more like a freckle give us an
update on your neighbors still they're
still being a fucking bitch can you fit
your fist in your mouth no when you eat
a taco do you turn your head or the taco
I go full head tilt
you can't fucking half-ass it try the
taco then all the toppings fall out you
have to turn your head
it's like other things will you show me

he's pretty little marbles gonna show
everyone now you will go to stairs

bed did you shortcut

do you think people can ever be friends
with their exes I absolutely think
people can be friends with their exes in
fact I'm friends with most of my exes
except for one of you who can suck a big
fat fucking dick I'm not gonna say which
one but figure it out amongst yourselves
what are your thoughts on the
legalization of marijuana
my thoughts are hurry up and fucking
make it legal so that ever I can shut
the fuck up about it I don't even smoke
weed I'm just tired of everyone arguing
about it quite honestly and I don't see
a problem with it most embarrassing
moment go uh well there are so many but
I would have to say I'm still angry at
that kid preschool for panting me in
front of everyone I was also wearing a
onesie jumper so it was more like a tee
Tuckahoe clothes do you shave or wax I
gotta be fucking honest with you right
now and this is something that guys do
not understand guys things to think that
waxing is so much better than shaving
but they're fucking wrong when you wax
yeah sure it's all nice and soft and
everything's all nice whatever for like
two weeks but then you have to grow
the hair out in order to get it waxed
again so then you're fucking you got
hairy legs and armpits and crotch all
over the place you have like two good
weeks of hairlessness and then the rest
of the time you're growing out your
hairy parts back it's disgusting when
you could just fucking shave that shit
every day and then you're like yay look
at me does the carpet match the drapes
oh well concern I haven't had any carpet
since like more than 10 years ago
no the carpet is the same colors this
grows out which is brown since your
birthday was a few days ago what do you
think about gifts what are the best and
worse obviously I think the best gifts
are the ones where someone really
thought about you do you guys want to
see what max got me for my birthday now
you're probably not gonna understand it
but basically when we first moved here
we walked past this window with this
awesome painting in it and I always
looked at him was like that makes
absolutely no sense but I couldn't stop
laughing and it made me so happy so for
my birthday
he got it for me and I'll show you we
knew how fucking sick is that are you
going to get another puppy and what
breed would you like to have I am dying
to get another dog but my apartment has
a two animal claws and the least I'm not
allowed to have more than Kermit and
marbles until I move I want like a big
dog I want a poodle or something awesome
because they think poodles have really
cool hairdos and they're really smart
and nothing gets mr. marbles but he is
not very smart I'm sorry what's your
credit card number oh it's uh one two
three fuck you what's your favorite and
least favorite part about living in LA
favorite thing about living LA is the
weather it's fucking awesome
it's sunshiny least favorite thing about
LA is everyone here dries like their
sixteen-year-old girl that just got
their license today it's fucking
ridiculous like you are literally just
driving to protect yourself from someone
else killing you do you fold or scrunch
toilet paper

their toilet paper before they wipe
their ass with it no we just go
