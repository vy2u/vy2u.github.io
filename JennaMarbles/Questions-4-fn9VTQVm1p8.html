really creepy hotel what oh this is the
picture above the bed there's you it's
thick I'm in a hotel because right now a
house is getting fumigated for termites
not just my house I live in an apartment
so the entire building I guess they all
scheduled when they wanted their
fumigation to happen but I just got a
letter this and you gotta get the fuck
out I'm in hotel and no my landlord is
not paying for it she lives in Japan
doesn't speak any English just give fuck
about me things that you miss because I
didn't tell anyone
hey my apartment caught on fire which
was super awesome I was getting on a
flight to Austin it had to leave the
airport like 6:00 in the morning so
naturally I just waited until all night
to not go to sleep and stay up and pack
and let the house win some food bill
tonight came back my apartment was on
fire open the door it's smoke just pours
out of the door and I'm like oh my god
and Carmen and bubbles are like see so
called everyone a bent fan above my
washer and dryer caught on fire and then
caught all the clothes on fire and bunch
of sheets on fire and melted my washer
and dryer and then because they didn't
want to go in through the basement door
they cut open my garage door with a
chainsaw and it all the water poured out
but the sprinklers contained it to just
the garage
and this weekend is my brother's wedding
so reminder to those of you who will be
looking for me at VidCon I'm not gonna
be there cuz my brother's getting me so
yeah I'm in this fucking sketchy ass
hotel like for days houses got a giant
tent on it got all my shit in it and I
just realized like 8 million things I
forgot that I need for the weekend the
wedding whatever look so I want to make
a questions video and answer all your
questions it's been a year that's the
last one last night I asked for any
questions that you have and I would
answer your questions to them to you too
missions have you kissed a girl I played
college softball you can't imagine what
the answer to that is what is your go-to
alcoholic beverage aside from just
straight shots of fireball
I'd say Red Bull vodka because I like to
be really caffeinated when I'm drunk get
fucking out of control what is that
beeping you ever play Pokemon I don't
but I'm not missing out it's not like a
cool thing so I fucking get on that
fucking hate this question if you could
only have one would it be current or
marbles
fuck you but all of your perhaps that
question that's horrible hate you you
know the answer to that it's Kermit
why is my cat being horny all by herself
she's fixed and acting like his sex flop
maybe should have sex with your cat what
are your feet doing when you're making a
video I'm not giving it to this there's
a bunch of like sick fuckers out there
that just want to see my feet at every
video not falling for it
would you let someone spread Nutella on
your booty yeah Yolo are you at all
attracted to Justin Bieber this is a
really complicated question I think
because I was an adult when he was a
child so I perceived him as a child
he then became an adult while I was
still an adult but to me and my brain
he's still always a child but I am
attracted to him as an adult and it feel
bad about it because I think you still a
child does that make me a pedophile what
famous person do you want to marry
Rihanna if you had a baby with someone
who would be fucking Rihanna have you
got another dog what would you name it
just top secret information but I would
stick with my motif of boys so it would
be a big boy dog and its name would
either be derp or Gary yeah those are my
ideas but I have to meet up goofy he is
when are you coming to Australia on the
15th I think the 15th of August like
soon couple weeks but then again I don't
even know because I forgot what my
brother's wedding was surprised when I'm
call me flying on Thursday
I don't even have a dress dear Jenna how
did you teach Kermit not to shit
everywhere my Italian Greyhound shits
everywhere it's really shitty well
that's a funny question because Louie
ask you a question how do you know
Kermit doesn't shit everywhere because
fucking does to answer your question I
didn't teach her how to not shit
everywhere because he just shits where
the fuck he wants creamy or chunky
peanut butter Oh creamy creamy peanut
butter all the way chunky peanut butter
just like messes up my pamper jelly flow
it's like that's not right the texture
of that is not right and you know it
people that make peanut butter would you
rather Kermit have one leg missing or
Marvel's have no ears the fuck is wrong
with you I guess Marvel have no ears
like what if he had no ears it just
looked like a little pool cue like an
8-ball got into living yellow that's
where meeples balls used to be what
color is your vagina seriously you look
like the kind of guy that would ask that
question
it's rainbow how many dogs would you
have if you can have an endless amount
have you seen the show animal hoarders
it would be like that write a haiku in
under 30 seconds about pajamas your time
starts now
let's see pajamas I like to wear you on
me can we go sleep now how many times
have you gotten a booth on your car
definitely more than two so probably
three I used to like to pay my parking
tickets all right like to get the ticket
and then give the city of fucking
wherever I'm living the finger and say
put it on the tab and that I like to
forget about it and then I get a boot on
my car shut up do you have any hidden
tattoos no go ahead and tattoos just
just that one with my wrists I don't
have anything you need to be special to
see if you randomly woke up one morning
and you miraculously gained a dick what
would be the first thing you do I'd like
pee on stuff right I have to pee sitting
down on the toilet if you have a dick
you can like aim it I just I would just
pay on like as many things as possible
have you ever smoked weed and if you did
what was it like I have smoked weed and
I cannot smoke weed because I am already
way too weird to be
and it just I can't he do it who's your
favorite character on Game of Thrones
it's Kelly see now this is a funny
question during an emergency you can
only grab three things with you what
would you grab well considering that
when my house just caught on fire I did
grab three things I grabbed Kermit
marbles and a bag of cheeseburgers yes
my inner fat kid strong will you ever be
a brunette again or show us a picture of
you with brown hair but it looks awesome

made I am partial to what are this what
are the press six if you would like me

greatest fear getting your blood drawn
