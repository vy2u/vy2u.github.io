watching this right now I am on a plane
to fucking another country we and I do
not do well with traveling it stresses
me out and I'm a little bit scared of
flying
don't tell anyone so I wanted to make I
even made a questions video in 8 months
so I didn't just want to have it be
whatever I wanted to make a drunk
questions video I want to answer your
questions with no filter like I just
want to get out of my head space out of
my brain and I just want to give you the
realest fucking answers that I can give
I am drinking cherry vodka and coke
which tastes like a cherry coke it's a
delicious drink I used to make it for
ladies all the time when I was a
bartender oh my hands are in my pants if
you had never become a youtuber what do
you think you'd be doing right now I
think I'd be working with kids because
kids are my homies stop like in this
matter what age kid either like give me
your fucking your baby till you're
seventeen year old and we can hang out
and kick it whoa best friends with
children this is just gonna be downhill
from there what do you want to do when
you grow up
that's easy be Rihanna every day I wake
up and I'm like am I really I just want
to be Rihanna - all of her like drug and
weed smoking too weird for drugs I can't
do drugs I just can't I can't even try
them you guys don't understand it's like
when you live inside my brain and it's
so weird already I can't do drugs hey
Jenna what's a good question to ask you
what skirmish paper color Kermit's
favorite color is chicken
why you so hot off of a normal say how
old are you I don't think this is legal
what questions do you hate getting ass I
hate getting at
questions about people that are no
longer in my life and you guys that know
me know what people are no longer in my
life I don't want to fucking talk about
them kick rocks by hashtag up that dick
have you ever licked your dog's penis
the fuck is wrong with you like only in
the afternoons after like noontime but
other than that no you're sick what is
one thing that you bought that you
really didn't need but you bought it
anyways because it looked cool I don't
know there's a dog backpack coat since
you just say surprise me at the hair
salon was the crazy slash worst
hairstyle you've ever gotten the
craziest hairstyle I have ever had my
friend Ellen go back he cut my bangs
into stairs and then a very blood cut in
the back but then left one really long
piece because he had chopped a bunch of
it off cuz I didn't give a fuck but he
died that like purple and blue and green
and you don't like tapered into a tail
and he was like that's her tail I have
scares and a tail and fuck everyone do
you like Iggy Azalea
do you like Iggy Azalea I found it easy
Lea like a long time gone Raoul shark
hip-hop calm and I found her song my
world and then I found her YouTube
channel of her freestyling and just like
jiving around she's since deleted all
those - stuff and then I tweeted at her
I think like three years ago I treated
her can I be on your white girl team
full of bad bitches and she was like
yeah of course and I was like sure I
died now what inspired the pearls and
t-shirt combo I used to do this shit all
the time let's get real play some sad
music Jenna so my grandmother it's my
mother's mother and they didn't have the
greatest relationship I didn't hang out
there a whole lunch but she left me a
pearl necklace and
we'll just very amazing and sweet and
thoughtful and then my mom had it
appraised not this one but she had it
appraised and it was not real pearls it
was plastic so once I found out that it
wasn't real pearls I was like great now
you can wear it all the times now I
don't have to have it be like a family
heirloom
and I used to wear that mother fucker
like there was no tomorrow and this was
after I stopped wearing a telephone cord
as a necklace for years and years the
thought is really fucking cool and it
was cool and also another honest answer
is because all of my necklaces right now
all those gold ones that are usually
where they're currently in a giant knot
would you be living in LA if you weren't
internet famous first of all let me get
something straight I hate I despise the
term internet famous this is a joke okay
I have intimate friends these people are
my friends I meet them in person this is
not some fucking bullshit garbage okay
to answer the essence of your question I
don't think I would live in LA
if I wasn't on YouTube I got sick of
flying back and forth from Boston to LA
I love the weather here it's sunny every
day it's ridiculously nice it's also
ridiculously expensive and stupid and
everyone here sucks and doesn't have a
soul I don't think I'm gonna raise my
children here or live here forever life
is all about choices you have to plant
your seeds water them all and then see
which one's grow I'm happy that I was
open to new possibilities in life but
this this place is very sad
so have you lost slush gained friends
because of YouTube I have not lost any
friends views of YouTube anyone knows my
friend beforehand has been my friend
since anyone that I've become friends
with and then
become friends with is purely just
because they stopped this human beings
there's nothing to do with YouTube so no
what is jennamarbles relationship status
they can I take him he taken I take in
like Liam Neeson's daughter but then
that on a scale of one to ten how drunk
are you right now look at like I'm eight
pretty drunk who is your man crush
Monday George st. Pierre Maria Moreno is
what is your favorite thing about your
baby niece was everything an acceptable
answer I love love my baby niece within
the whole world if you were arrested
what would it be for I've actually been
arrested then goes 22 years old I've
gotten a speeding ticket in high school
so they are mailing these notifications
from the state of New York to my Boston
dorm but they're for one year and then I
was out and they're like oh we can't get
a hold of you and you owe us 30 dollars
to the state of New York from hypes like
three years beforehand and then $30 and
so they suspended my license and I got
pulled over in New Hampshire
I had a headlight out my car was just
like I couldn't fix it I couldn't afford
it and so I got pulled over and I'm like
I'm really really sorry I know my
headlights out and then he ran my
license and he was like oh I got bad
news for you
Oh your license is actually suspended
because you owe money to the state of
New York so I'm gonna have to go ahead
and rest whom I had marbles with me and
my boyfriend at the time yeah he bailed
me out of jail for $40 they
fingerprinted me then mugshot and we did
all of that but if I got arrested I'm
pretty sure that's what it would be for
owing money to a state that you
love it hey Jenna can you even what are
you gonna miss your mommy she's gonna be
gone for two weeks sorry this is a
boring video this week but I have so
many things to do and I'm just trying to
