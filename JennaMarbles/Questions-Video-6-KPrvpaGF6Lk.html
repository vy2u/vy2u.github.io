in London I was here for Sophia's stop
oh my god I was here for something in
this city and I did a Q&amp;amp;A and a
meet-and-greet at the YouTube space
London with Louise Michael of glitter it
was fantastic thank you to summer in the
city and YouTube London for having me it
was a great time thank you to everyone
that came out I loved meeting you for
those of you that made me follow the
podcast or like our live streams like
the date fan you might know that I've
been like pretty sick for like three
weeks out and I've been on two different
kinds of antibiotics
one of which right when we like landed
that night I went to like one of the
emergency clinics or whatever the fuck
and got another dose of antibiotic and
this week I asked you on my facebook if
I could just do sort of a questions
video because I've been rough few weeks
for me the last one that I did was in
May of twenty thousand fourteen forty
thousand fourteen oh my god stop I feel
like my brain doesn't work look at in
medicine in the year twenty thousand
sixty fuck up also I hope you don't mind
that Julian is here because we're in a
hotel in London and it's kind of rude of
me to be like Julian can you get the
fuck out I would like to answer them and
not like be super trollee I think it's
time that I answer some questions for
real Jenna we need answers BAM okay
Jenna I really need to up my dating game
do you have any good pick-up lines that
I could use to make all the boys fall in
love with me don't you good pick-up
lines on fucking rearrange the alphabet
I'd put on your butt a good line if you
just want to just go in for the kill as
you say hey you got something on your
lips and they're like oh what is it then
you just go my lips and then you just
kiss them unless you think that's too
forward in which case dude dude you guys
gotta call the cops my own boyfriend
won't even let me kiss it
I mean Bibi Bibi Bibi pussy hey do you
have Pokemon go cuz why don't you take
down two kids what is your biggest pet
peeve in regard to other people while
traveling I use someone on playing Hotel
driving I've already made like a couple
videos talking about particularly
airports but all I can think of right
now is that on our way over here some
lady woke up in the middle of the night
over in the plane so it's kind of
clouding my ability
of other things that make me mad but I'd
say within the top five or ten it's just
like falling down and in here hey so I'm
actually pretty scared of flying a lot
of the time it's a habit of mine ever
since before they were fucking TVs on
airplanes to take the safety card out
and read it like front-to-back every
single time and everyone makes fun of me
I gave him the flight attendants sort of
looking me like she's fucking reading
that little pamphlet right now like
that's what the fuck no one does that I
pull it out every single time and I read
it and I hate and people make fun of me
for it I'm sorry that I like to be
informed and educated I don't know when
we flew here backwards also our seats
were like two seats are this way like
two seats were this way and me and
Julianne flew backwards here first time
that the brace yourself position isn't
like this it's like this swear to God
like if shit got real I would take the
pamphlet with me it says take nothing
with you but I would take that pamphlet
along those same lines I seem to be the
only person that remembers to put all of
their liquids and gels all of them in a
little ziploc bag
I am the only person that once I get
there pulls out a little ziploc bag of
lip chapstick and stuff like this is a
rule you knew this coming in here I'm
sorry for just being good at following
rules I'm a rule follower I am follower
I'm a sheeple what's the downside of
sharing your life on YouTube are there
any at all I would say by far that the
pros far outweigh the cons in so many
ways if I had to choose one of the
biggest downsides I would say that
because this is a democratized platform
and anyone can do it anyone can share
and say anything that they want people
genuinely really think that they know
who I am or know me personally oh she
sort of just like my internet friends
that I know and like if we met each
other like I can come to her house
because it seems like that all the time
because it is so personal so I'd say one
of the biggest downsides is when people
don't quite make that connection that
like you might know me on the internet
but I don't know who you are so that
line of like invasion gets crossed
sometimes that makes sense it's just
it's a weird new thing but I'd say 99%
of the time people are incredibly
respectful and kind to me in person I
have no
please you know that 1% man y'all are
fucked up y'all need Jesus
how did you go from ranting all the time
to trolling I've seen your videos saying
the rants were going to stop but I want
to know how you came about that change
in your life it was very impressive to
see you change so drastically for your
own happiness because just sort of like
an angry person for you don't like when
you're in middle school or something
like if your friend doesn't talk to you
or something very small happens it seems
like the world is ending
well in my early 20s I would say it was
like that like things would be
frustrating or aggravating but on an
exponential scale in my mind it seemed
so much worse than they were I would be
so much more angry then you could be I
mean honestly I don't have much to
complain about people do fucked up shit
sometimes but I just don't it doesn't
serve me to sit around and be pissed off
about it and I just wanted to change my
mindset and what I was choosing to focus
my energy on and make sure that it was
something I was starving me and trolling
serves me because it makes me laugh and
it makes me happy that's why I be angry
when you could just you know troll the
fuck out of it a lot of the things that
like really pissed me off now are not
appropriate to just spew on the internet
if you know what I'm saying imagine
you're sitting under a tree
cuz that's how much shade I just think I
think that's what being an adult is
buying things that you hate and also
having to shut your mouth like all the
time and bottle it all on the inside
instead of just letting it out what
random thing about Julian annoys you the
most what about you annoys him the most
one of the things that annoys me the
most about Julian is that he's a tornado
in the kitchen he can like make things
in record speed but it also means that
he's left out every ingredient that it
takes to make it all of that is
tolerable because I follow the tornado
and put everything away and we make a
really good you know kitchen team but
what pisses me off is that he will take
one piece of paper towel at a time use
it for something crumple it and leave it
on the counter and so while I'm walking
around in the wake of the tornado
there's like seven individual paper
towels that you've used for once instead
of just keeping it and wiping it up for
something else or throwing it out you
crumple it and leave it on the counter
like that is not the garbage but I'll
also be sort of passive
about it because I'll grab one and I'll
grab another moment are you done with
these Andrew breathe really loudly a lot
that's not news though either because
people on the livestream complain about
it non-stop that you breathe
sorry for being alive I didn't realize
that I couldn't be alive probably the
thing that annoys me the most about you
there's like talking to your dogs and
then there's like cooing at your dogs
and then there's like giving it too much
and then all the way over here is Jenna
cooing for hours at the top of her lungs
at the highest pitch I've ever heard
they like songs so sometimes I'll have
to literally tell Jenna that's good okay
enough okay that's a lot that's a lot
you like forget that I have ears what is
the most annoying sound you and Julian
can make I think just breathing is the
most annoying sound you can make oh do
you have a movie or a song that you use
as a litmus test for how cool a new
person in your life can possibly be I
like that I have a movie but a good song
is El Sol nidito like you're either down
with that song or you can get out but I
think that my litmus test for new people
is usually like internet humor someone
doesn't like internet humor our
friendship probably isn't gonna be that
good because I can't just explain things
to you all day every day and why they're
funny have you ever had to walk away
from a friendship I don't mean naturally
losing touch I mean about face forward
march
get the fuck out yes I've had to do this
for lots of different reasons throughout
my life you can use your imagination and
I'm sure you've had to do it in the past
too but I mean there's pretty obvious
reasons why you wouldn't be friends with
people and tell them to get the fuck out
of your leg what is your meaning of life
do you think you found it yet I don't
think there is a universal meaning for
everyone I think we all have our own
special purpose okay this might be a
little bit long-winded and disclaimer my
apologies to anyone that is religious
that does not believe in anything that
I'm about to say there might be a little
bit out there but you know what's coming
from my mouth you know what to expect I
don't think that there is a universal
meaning or purpose I think there's two
ways to go through life and it took me a
little while to learn that I look at
marbles and he's so stressed out about
everything all the time right like the
wind blows and he's very upset
you know we're in the car the shivers
about it and then you look at peach and
she's just over there and everything is
great I don't really think that I
learned how to take all the things that
make me upset or angry or whatever and
realize that I can sit with them and be
angry about them and let it dictate my
choices and how I feel about things or I
could just be like peach and just chill
and let life happen and I found that
that way makes me feel much happier so I
think in terms of purpose maybe your
purpose is to figure out whatever it is
your soul needs to learn in this
particular lifetime if that's something
you believe or not but just to enjoy
your time and that you can freak out the
whole time or you can just let it happen
I also think for me personally like the
apex of being a human is teaching
another human how to human but that
human doesn't have to come from my body
like even if it's like a 14 year old
that I adopt and you're like my smaller
human that I have to teach out of human
or it's a niece or a nephew or whatever
a neighbor I think that it's important
for me on my life journey to teach
another human how to human then you
fulfilled part of your purpose also are
you one of those people that has tomato
sauce on the top of fries or to the side
to the side you can't put it on the top
that makes it fuck it oh my god it makes
a mess what are you doing
that's disgusting did anyone from the
calling in sick to jobs we don't have
video ever call you back or and get up
you get up you know no one called me
back because I blocked my phone number
with the exception of the first one so
no the first one did not call me back
will you make a part - I thought about
making a part two to that video I don't
know why people like that so much but I
thought about it do people take sneaky
pictures of you in public yes they do
and I can see you you guys aren't that
sneaky do you consider yourself famous
I'm in the boat of no because this is a
democratized platform so anyone can do
it so I don't really feel like some of
those traditional things apply to this
scenario honestly I'm not doing anything
that you can't do fan you know I'm
saying just have a different brain do
you work out are you a lazy human like
me not fun I'll fucking work out I'll
work out that wasn't fair
I'll never do it again do you ever
regret doing your masters in psychology
or wish you'd had a career more in line
with what you studied no I want to say
never I will never regret doing my
masters in psychology education is
really important and I did it it's over
no one can ever take that away from me
I've talked to a lot of other people
that work in the internet or are faced
with the choice of pursuing a current
career or finishing their education and
I'm always like an education pusher I'm
like just do it you know I know it's
really exciting and people always tell
you do things like Oh strike when the
iron's hot like it's a fucking iron band
it's gonna be hot for a little bit okay
don't freak out about it you need to
finish your education now because you're
not gonna do it when you're thirty I
think that it's really important I think
that you learn a lot of things as an
adult in graduate school or in college
or things like that that you just don't
learn in other places it's one of the
last times that you're surrounded by
your peers constantly all the time and
you're on the same level of life
experience you learn a lot from being in
that environment and I know in the
future like old colleges will be online
and for free but that negates like half
of the cool stuff that you learn in
college like where you fit into society
and like who you are and what your
identity is not really shapes you as a
person and what you do with the rest of
your life well you and PewDiePie ever
collab my face by the way I love you and
my dick is all the way out for her
omelet dicks out for her ramen never for
you I mean I'm down Felix turn me up
here what am I supposed to do
when I still feel at 25 and married that
I have no clue what I'm doing just keep
doing what you're doing nobody knows
what they're doing
you just like everybody else just keep
swimming just keep swimming nobody knows
what they're doing
welcome to being alive can you whisper
into the microphone rectal exam so I can
make my roommate laugh don't ask
questions online rectal exam have you
gotten your Kylie lip kits yet if yes
can you tell us what you think of them
do I look like I got that Kylie lip kit

Kylie lip kits plural as if I even got
one of them

exist I can't even get one I don't know
how you people keep getting Kylie lip
kit I can't get in one video you said
you hate prescription drugs why I mean
what the fuck
pharmacy and pharmacology are awesome
you know I'm not
ix at pharmacies and pharmacology is
awesome okay I just don't like putting
things in my body you can even ask
Julian I have like a weird aversion to
taking anything that I don't absolutely
have to take so like if I broke my arm
in half and someone was like look you
have to take this relish you're going to
be in the worst pain you're not you're
gonna black out every time you open your
eyes I'd be like fair enough but unless
I absolutely have to take it I don't
want to take it I don't know drugs scare
me one time I was in like fourth grade
we watched an animated movie about
heroin and I passed out if you were
Julian for a day and Julian were you for
a day what would you both do well first
thing I would do is with my dick out for
Harambee then I would pee standing up
then I would feel what it feels like to
deadlift 500 pounds and be like fuck yet
and I would just play through just
clearly yeah it's there like this all
day if you had to be trapped inside one
movie for the rest of your life what
movie would that be my neighbor totoro
oh no I take it back Harry Potter what
do you have Julian under in your phone
lol Juli peace out of his butt in honor
of the Olympics what Olympic sport do

dressage ring dressage that's where the
horses dance I mean I really think that
I could do really well at it you just
