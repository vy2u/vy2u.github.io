tell you what's going on but our life's
a little bit crazy so bear with us the
next few weeks okay it's a lot one of my
favorite things to do is just kick back
and be entertained you know what I'm
saying I think there's a lot of people's
favorite things to do I don't think
you're special in that I debated making
a series just called watch YouTube with
me or Regis it's like Google deep dive
but just for YouTube and you know when
you're just falling down holes of like
recommended videos yeah we should do
that sometime
if you guys want I think it's fun you
know you like watch a TV do together and
then you discuss it and yeah watch TV
speaking of YouTube holes there's like a
sneeze haul on YouTube it's compilations
of youtubers sneezing it's like a fetish
or something it's so weird
okay sorry anyways you're shaking our
entire we've made two of these videos in
the past where we react to compilation
videos of us yeah people send them to me
and they make me laugh so hard I love
them so much and you can tell how much
work goes into them because it is not
easy to do that the last one we made was
and we're in Portugal yes almost a year
now so as you can't imagine some good
ones have popped out since it's time to
revisit the fresh content that you've
created we shrink our kitchen down to
the bottom left corner and watch
somebody yeah let's shrink our kitchen

scientific fact my god there's no longer
a moustache when the beards gone but the
moustache stays that is when it becomes
a must i 1,000,000% disagrees i'm sorry
