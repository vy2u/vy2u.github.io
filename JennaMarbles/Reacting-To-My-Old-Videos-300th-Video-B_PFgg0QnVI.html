behind me I don't think I can stop them
thick marbles is cleaning Kermit so full
disclosure I think today's video is
going to be a little longer then I would
usually post on this channel a little
more in depth a little more relaxed and
that's because I hit like three major
milestones on my channel in the last
couple weeks I reached 16 million
subscribers I reach two billion views
and this is my 300th video so today I'm
feeling like very sentimental but if you
don't make it through the entire thing I
just want to say thank you so much for
supporting me and caring about me and
treating me like a human being for so
many years now and I just really
appreciate it so people have been
requesting that I do this for quite some
time
I was the tag that was going around for
a little bit where people react to their
old videos and I really didn't want to
do it for a couple of reasons
the first of which is because it makes
me absolutely cringe to watch my videos
don't like to watch them
I don't watch them as a matter of fact
we have a rule in this house when people
come over and sometimes we like to sit
in the living room and hang out and
watch YouTube videos you're not allowed
to watch other people's videos which is
a rule that Ryan Higa thinks is
hilarious to break just because it's so
it's hard to watch yourself and it's
like cringy especially if it's all just
us was weird man and the second reason I
didn't want to do it was because it felt
like the ultimate jumping of the shark
that's the definition of your channel
jumping the shark right you reacting to
your old videos it just feels so meta
and so ridiculous I got to thinking in
my sentimental miss then it really
wasn't such a bad idea and then I guess
I would like to do it I get a lot of
comments a lot of times from people
saying that they liked my old videos and
you know they want me to do things like
I used to and every old video of mine
I've watched the video sucks like half
of them I didn't even export them right
like wrong like they're just so awful
and then on top of that the subject
matter is pretty cringe not that I do
much better now you know everything I
put up is a little questionable
reflecting back on the things that I've
done in the
ass I just get a sense that I've grown
up a lot and I hope that you feel the
same way you know I think I will always
have a relatively immature sense of
humor but I am certainly a full grown
adult at this point which I like a lot
and what's that saying that every seven
years or something all of your cells
turn over so you're technically a
different person I do very much feel
like in comparison to the girl that was
uploading videos yelling and screaming
obscenities I am definitely a grownup
version of her that was the time I just
got to suck it up man just kind of watch
some cringe here we go all right I'm
gonna go all the way back to what looks
like the first video on this channel
okay I mean this was a good video at the
time but I do remember exporting it
completely wrong
so everything's like pixelated oh man
this is brutal
like I realize that a lot of this has
copyright music and I don't really know
what to do but sure can't even watch -
Jenna what's your strategy here I'm
going all glazed
it's information for these cheaters I
mean these guys are veterans at this
point very yeah a very nice young girl
with a very large chip on her shoulder
and quite the strong Boston accent how
many that and yet again I mean that was
my job to go have fun and make a video
that day and I exported it wrong and
it's all pixelated I'm still incredibly
embarrassed and ashamed that um this
type of quality shot on a potato still
exists on my channel so also just to
give you a little backstory I started
the channel jenna Marbles because my
first channel was called Jay Maury 66
which was my real last name and my mom
was trying to get a job at the time and
it was sort of ruining all of her google
searches because my youtube channel kept
popping I think it was like 2009 or
whatever I created the jenna Marbles
channel was only because my first jail
had my real last name in it like a
genius so I want to go over to that
channel and see what's happening you
know who's on fire and fellas they're
born there was a fire my job and as a
good employee I put the fire out the
fire extinguisher but can we just talk
about this Stan I was working in a
tanning salon and I was just like this
is a good book now to be fair I don't
have any makeup on so it looks extra
crazy I'm less orange now sometimes I
still air a little on the side of orange
but I am past this space thankfully
because this is just I'm offended you
know I'm surprised that my face doesn't
look like pure leather at this point
like maybe a little bit but it really
should look like pure leather Oh naughty
look at his face he looks so young
I mean again I don't know if I can even
play more than a couple seconds of this
because of the copyrighted music because
I didn't know any better I didn't know
all of the rules of the internet before
I started posting things to the internet
I don't serve people into thinking
good luck if you were born really ugly
like me have no vehicle like that it
looks like it feels like Doritos because
it did feel like Doritos that I mean at
least I look a little less tan in this
video right and I've rickrolled
everybody which I'm very proud I like
this one because it's like I can't post
a video on the internet now without
people being like I hate your eyebrows
like your eyebrows are the worst like
they're kind of shaped a little crazy so
I got to do the best that I can but like
come on I've come a long way those
things are demonic looking like to pop
myself up the voice very jari I know
that I still sometimes talk like that
but I mean it's it's a lot if you could
just dial it back like a bunch of
notches it'd be really great this twenty
four thousand dislikes I mean I can't
say that I blame you but I mean at the
time this was what started everything on
YouTube for me in 2010 I mean it was an
acceptable video like now people are
like I liked your old videos like look
at this it's like two minutes of just
someone like squawking at you and
putting on copious amounts of makeup
it's a little funny it is I would say
the funniest thing about this video at
this point is that people still don't
know how to say that title they're like
that video where you're like teaching
people how to be hot this is quite the
title I don't really do clickbait I'm
just like the most descriptive title
that I can make is what goes out there
that video though is like it's so cringy
it's so cringe why would you believe
this giant living room all to yourself
connected to me it's like just so
impaired
there's copyrighted song pek I can't
even fully understand what I'm saying
this forms and then I'm putting get hit
like in front of us I was like I didn't
like when she made fun of him by calling
him gay but it shows how she's grown in
the past few years as a person it's very
true I've said words in the past that
just aren't okay a lot of my older
videos like I said some words that are
just offensive I think having a comment
section and always reading the comments
has helped me a lot as a person you know
kind of grew up and realized that I
don't want to talk like that I don't
want to be like that I don't want to use
the words that I used and I just stopped
I'm pretty sure that I've only ever
cried like three times on the internet I
think one was when I got marbles one was
when I got Kermit and one was when we
got peach it like to me there's some of
like the sweetest happiest moments of my
life so I'm like really happy that I
have the video of them but the video so
bad okay is the only camera that I owned
at this point was my laptop that was my
boyfriend Jimmy in the background who
had come with me and he felt the whole
thing on my laptop Oh mom oh you're so
lucky so cute we're going on the London
I love love life journey together
sound all right I mean like looking back
now I probably should have done a more
calm job introducing them to each other
but he was so sad the first couple days
all I did was cry look how skinny just
like a little baby just to anyone that
ever complains about me uploading videos
of my dogs I mean I've been the same
since day one so five years ago I made
how to avoid talking to people you don't
want to talk to again really great title
god this video sucks all right so I'm
sure about this and I liked it no be out
with my friends okay again the worst
quality the worst audio just terrible
terrible all around party love this so
what do you do you walk me like I don't
wanna work though almost every shot you
can see my arm go like this towards the
end because I'm stopping recording I
don't even like give myself a beat then
cut it like actually cutting oh look at
this I get it I know why people liked it
and it was silly in such a bad video now
like it's like not entertaining at all
sort of drags on we get it you make a
goofy face we have to keep watching it
the accent is killing me she seems like
a nice girl I get a lot of comments of
people being like can you do ran it's
like people that pissed me off at the
gym and then they'll go and watch this
and like this whole video alright so I
mean this is behind a garbage maybe
while you were looking over at my
elliptical you wouldn't notice that and
maybe you would like I see a lot of
people that do story time videos and
stuff now and I get it like I've always
gotten why people like to watch that I'm
just I'm not that angry really I I would
never
at this point my life think to sit down
and make a video about someone looking
at my elliptical I think it's just a
matter of perspective maybe what I
choose to spend my time thinking about
it's not really this anymore okay so for
anyone never been to my house before
like just by this first sentence though
I don't know who's watching these videos
I'm literally saying this as like post
them to my Facebook page I assumed the
majority of people that were watching it
had probably been to my house so hard
would come soon smell meanwhile it's
like everyone is watching this has not
been through but carry on
peanut butter and jelly please like
during the shot son I like looking at
the cameras looking at myself in the
laptop Tilly face noodle punch this
wouldn't even be like a vine that this
way I think it's okay the air has
changed so much that was I feel like at
a time on YouTube where anything over a
couple minutes people just clicked away
I didn't want to watch because people
were there for short form entertainment
and now you know you'd sit and watch an
hour podcast or more you can watch hours
and hours of things on YouTube people
really want to do that it's just another
thing that confuses me young people are
like make videos like your old ones like
what do you mean like two minutes of me
doing almost nothing in a video that
took maybe three hours tops to shoot and
edit I think I also had every intention
of taking this clip out of my hair I
just never did it I remember shooting
this video I was done shooting it and
editing it I like noon that was the
thing though you know you could do a
video in the morning and have it be done
by noon it's just upload it cuz it's
only a bit long disappear
I paint okay there's an example of me
just saying bad words for the sake of
saying that focus laughing out of peer
embarrassed and also the best face this
was like the height of people really not
knowing what I was doing or
understanding and like having the
excited people have been would look up
my youtube channel and it would be like
this
and they understandably would be like
Jenna I feel like you're throwing your
life away I'm like you might be right
I've had recent requests of people being
like can you please make a video like
magic like what is it about this video
that you're looking for me to recreate
was it just that I drew all over my face
or was it like heck been it's a minute
of nonsense I think like my entire life
will be a cycle of me looking back and
everything I've ever done being like
this is horrible I hate it
all right watch what girls do on the
internet which sparked a whole series of
what girls and guys do which I have
quietly let die Wow so here's an example
of a video that I probably wouldn't make
again it's just called people I would
fuck Lady Gaga in any outfit I would do
absolutely anything the total guy from
Epic Meal Time wants me to do mobile
glass like so awkward because I never
first saw meeting them way to go patting
a decent watch was Jesus lot Will
Ferrell at any age with any hairstyle
you know choice word feel again I've
grown up a little bit from this video in
particular I'd like to click away now
that's okay
what bitches we're at the airport choice
of words fantastic
it looks so embarrassing for them to
think that I don't like talk like that
all the time and I really got to a point
in my life where people are like you're
way more calm in person than you are
your videos and I'm like Julio's it I'm
in a place to be pissed off and of
course you know sometimes I'm still like
on rent and I'm on fire and I'm just
like I gotta just get all this out right
now
but that's not anybody all day every day
looking back on some of these like angry
rants like I would hate for people to
think that that's what I'm like
constantly because that's obnoxious
and so I really did I made an effort to
make sure that what I was portraying on
the internet was actually Who I am more
of the time rather than the yelling
angry version but like look as I'm
shooting it the Sun sets it's just it's
been a long road to get to the point
where you know me being how I am in any
given moment is enough to have a fun
YouTube channel and I don't always have
to like turn something on or off in
order to make what I want to make or say
what I want to say that you can say it
in a way that's not so jarring
that took me a while to learn I think
when I put up landshark it was unlike
anything that I uploaded and people were
like what the fuck is this people hated
it when I uploaded it like I had it on
Facebook and people were like I hate you
for this this is the worst thing I've
ever seen like I don't like you anymore
after I uploaded it I really genuinely
thought that I would never do anything
like that ever again because it
genuinely pissed people off and that's
another thing about some of these videos
is like maybe there's it didn't come out
right
or it doesn't seem like a good video but
there were parts of it or a process of
it or while I was shooting it or
thinking about it that it seemed really
funny and sometimes you just have to see
things through until the end to realize
like this isn't my favorite you do good
things okay I would also like to note
that this might be one of the earliest
videos that I was using an actual camera
hahaha the Eiffel Tower is a lane one
wall with a landshark isolate this video
I think it's silly and goofy and like
what the Internet's supposed to be but I
mean that's just me I do remember just
having a hard time after I posted that
because people were so mad at me it
sucks to think like okay maybe I
uploaded something that people didn't
really like but like it felt like people
hate
me personally and that's like a lot of
what making YouTube videos consists of
is like people don't just not like it
they hate you personally it's very scary
and nerve-wracking to put yourself out
there after I uploaded landshark was
unfortunately one of those days
drunk makeup tutorial Jeff you haven't
noticed I don't really make that many
drug videos anymore because everyone's
just thinking them some alcoholic if
we're like every suggestion that someone
was giving me was like get drunk be
drunk
look is good if possible getting bad
Yuliya gyros on this is the time when
you can afford to take a break just feel
like you know what I know what my
eyebrows are I totally get it like why I
was funny and why people liked it and
asked for me to do other things drunk um
but I've definitely beaten that horse
horses beat you know I also probably do
them on occasion but it has been a
conscious effort to not just make about
your truck city ups I think I'm going to
end our trip down memory lane there I
certainly feel like I've changed a lot
as a person in terms of what it uploaded
onto the Internet you know there's times
where I look back and I'm super
embarrassed or when people think that
they might know who I am now based off
of things that I did you know even two
years ago or less than that and it's
just not a whole representation of me as
a person
it's just a nice grow and learn and it's
mostly due to constructive criticism and
feedback that you guys give me in you
know when I do things or say things that
I shouldn't do there's always been
people there to be like okay this is
goofy and I get that you did this with
the best of intentions but like you're
obnoxious can't help but feel a little
bit sentimental about all of it six
years on this channel and almost 10
years on YouTube as a whole it's been a
big learning experience a big growing
experience and I just feel so lucky and
grateful and thankful that I get to
continue doing it and
anybody still care so hard you know
listens to anything that I have to say I
just wake up everyday I'm surprised I
want you to know how much it means to me
how much I care about what you think and
that I do try to do right and make
things that are funny and entertaining
but never at the expense of people and
you know said lots of things I probably
shouldn't have said or made lots of
things I probably shouldn't have made
and there are many people that just
decided that that was enough and that I
was never worth watching or listening to
again but for those of you that have
been here with me and have grown with me
it just it means everything to me and I
just really appreciate it more than I
could ever possibly tell you when I
started out it was sort of just for fun
and you know it slowly turned into
something that I did for a living I'd
choose my life and I get to just laugh
for a living and I hope you can tell
that I have tried to grow up I try to
learn and I've tried to do right by
other people I'm grateful for anyone
that subscribed yesterday and I am
especially grateful to those of you that
have been with me since I lived in
Boston and I've watched me become an
actual adult and had a adult in training
thank you so so so so much for just
being kind to me and caring and giving
me a chance to learn from my mistakes
and I will try to continue to grow and
learn and do things the best that I can
in the future I want to live on the
internet I'm not in this to try to do
anything else be on the internet for as
long as I can and I genuinely mean that
and I always have I just think that this
is the most fun most cool most amazing
thing that I could have ever asked for
and I just appreciate you know what I
meet people in person and people are so
nice to me I can't explain to you how
that feels
people are just have been really
wonderful to me and I guess I'm just I'm
really grateful if anybody watched all
the ways to the end of this video
don't know why I just want to tell you
how grateful I am for your support and
kindness for however long you've been
here
um it just needs the world to me and I
you know sorry it's just blah oh there's
no good way to end this video or then
thank you and I will see you next week
