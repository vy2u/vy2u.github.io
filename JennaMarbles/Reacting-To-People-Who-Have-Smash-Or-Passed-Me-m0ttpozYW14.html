around on YouTube like nearly a month or
so yeah
it reminded me a lot of in my 300th
video I addressed the video that I had
made it that I wouldn't make again
called people I would fuck and in that
video I said I would fuck things with
Bud Light 30 and youtubers mind you they
were all people I would fuck so there
was no path but it was also a good
learning experience for me because at
that time I'm like 99% sure I never gone
to VidCon or playlist which I had never
met any of these people in person I
lived in Boston and I never first saw
myself ever meeting them in person it
was all just fun and games but then when
I met my idol I just seen in person for
the very first time I said hi I'm Jenna
nice to meet you I deeply apologize for
saying I would give you a scissor
sandwich you know it's kind of a weird
thing when you tell someone that you
would smash them let alone pass on them
and then you actually meet them in
person I thought it might be a little
fun thing to do if I found some of these
Smasher passes in which I was included
to just let you know that I've watched
them mm-hmm maybe most people won't see
your Smasher pass but I see everything
are you gonna be offended if anyone says
that they're gonna smash me and so I
just typed in smash her past Jenna the
first video that comes up whoa baby
I'm ready girl okay tomorrow good yeah
you're cute right smash your pet so far
seems pretty nice they seemed harmless
let's move on and we are going to be
doing another smack her past video is
accessible just like it really is
you're getting home I'm gonna have to
smash I feel like they were born after
you're a thousand to correct
jenna Marbles I'll be the shortest to me
I'm just going to say
ah straight up hey why would they not me
what do you want me to do huh should I
wait by your lockers before homeroom
because I don't like The Suite Life of
Zack and Cody
and because I don't get your drinking
George oh is that why look okay I know
your kids I get it
oh did I park my change layout of this
thing I don't know what I did to deserve
that other than be an adult should I
unroll my boot that's the problem the
colors of dryer yeah I can just tell it
brother I didn't love brown boxes right
now bottoms on my black skin white girl
well be right outside
don't touch it because it looks like a
mother like that what I like yeah I mean
now said yes everyone so far like was it
is about Regina bubbles in a bubble down
medium you two in everything so no time
for you Gina yeah but you make great
videos definitely better fine don't get
because my boxes in Braille why did no
one tell me that you don't actually have
to wear a jersey to play fifa I'm really
sorry but you must feel pretty sure that
he doesn't want to be like I smell funny
what's a girl gotta do to get hit on by
a stranger on the Internet
this has my review and it looks like
it's just me smash that and why would i
smash any models because she's really
funny she's good great sense of humor
from what I seen I think she follows a
vegan diet which is definitely a match
for me ah that was lying
that was a respectful smash her past I
feel like you could be respectful and
pass like you don't have to be a teacher
shit oh you see this to my mom my mom is
a
yay for me I'm all for people putting
themselves out there I appreciate is
that being strapped on it but it is
weird for me YouTube bringing fathers
and sons closer together
oh well new she's gonna get it exposed
and roasted and smashing and passing you
know horrible okay
like in is high this man to be honest
but wait what is what is this another
just catfish me with a get work pants
are all those when I had hundred layers
on you were here yes would you smash
yeah first one jenna Marbles I would
probably not smash I don't know I don't
think she's that attractive but I don't
she's very funny I think so she has
great personality but not that
attractive sorry jenna marbles but i
would that like reading mean comments
but hearing them reading be hearing them
honestly spoken but these are that mean
I'm not like none of this offends me
obviously everything is a completely
subjective and it's not it looks like a
personal attack
a kid like that Harbor video $20 she
would youtuber but she kicked me with
her face I don't think I have a winning
record right now why is this like a
smash with a dick ship on it man
what do I got to do to get that big shit
so go to your breath and select not not
black or SUV just like dick shit take me
on a trip on your dick ship Danny Gerard
