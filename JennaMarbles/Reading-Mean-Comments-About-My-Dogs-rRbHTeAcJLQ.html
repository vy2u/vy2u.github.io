I want to shave all I'm really going to
do it though my taking the grubart sweep
shapen I was on Twitch last night I
asked a dink fan for any video
suggestions and someone said that I
should read me and tweet about my dog
which is really funny to me because I
feel like I read them occasionally in
the comments and they crack me up this
is all in good fun I promise you and in
fact I asked on Twitter because the
majority of comments with any of my dogs
in the video it's just extremely
overwhelmingly positive because I mean
who goes on the Internet - just like
shit on dogs fucking sing so I thought
it'd be fun to read some mean comments
to my dogs and about my dogs because
let's be honest they deserve it ok I'm
going to save Kermit for last because
most of these roasts are about the
lovely Kermit so what do you say we
start with you big guy
muzzle are you ready to get roasted the
people on the internet said the not
mommy ok I think way worse advice is
marvel's alive burger honestly this I
see this comment all the time if I post
any video with the egg Easter like
Carlos is dead and my most recent
Instagram picture of marbles is just RIT
marbles like people think he's dead
like ok marbles looks like a hyena from
the Lion King
what's the one that chooses leg Edie he
looks like Edie
I'm surprised marbles knows which end to
eat his food with I think your dogs are
cataleptic but doesn't mean cataracts a
medical condition characterized by a
trance or seizure with the loss of
sensation and consciousness accompanied
by rigidity of the body you get a lift
and it's ok bubble you still alive
bubble Marvel's bark sounds exactly what
I would imagine entering the gates of
hell would sound like
they're sound like hell to you Marvel's
reminds me of my dead grandmother why is
every one thing you did if she didn't
help marble he would still have that
towel on at peach and Kermit's wedding
marble that is absolutely true and you
focus but what do marbles and a bottle
have in common they're both empty from
the neck up it's so Hollow hello I love
you so much but there's nothing in your
head marbles is literally a fat drunk
hamster at best I think a hamster might
actually be smarter than him well bowls
can't figure out how to eat food out of
a dish have to feed him his slop on the
floor that wasn't too bad was it
you don't even care cuz you don't know
where you are I love how even after I
like I'll post a video pin with balloons
floating up into the sky and people
still think he's dead okay merica he's
alive
peachy girl it is your turn in the hot
seat most of these comments are about
your weight he's doing very well she's
lost a lot of weight and she's very
healthy now doesn't mean you want to be
bad you know just kind of look like
robot but adorable stupid robot those
dogs are like deformed squirrel Marvel
is the picky eater and Peach is the
vacuum this was on the video of peach
when she was a puppy wait she was small
once like she just came out here peach
looks like raw chicken in this video
just her nasty flesh colored body
peaches the color of a waffle that was
almost cooked right but guts lips juicy
peaches head is too small for her body
they're one of the only breeds of dogs
his faces are smaller than their necks
which is why they have special collar
they're called martingales so when they
go like this because it just slip right
off their triangle face your dog mango
is fat I prefer jacksFilms dogs over
yours
oh okay Klondike and sundae do this did
you come yeah oh my gosh
two of your dogs only have like four
teeth and yet they still get back
somehow
peach is shaped like a fucking barrel oh
look we got a tweet from Jack Simpson so
yo are those things dogs are goblin
tweaks we sent get two of the same dog
oh wow look in Sunday a clock makes you
this pink because he's good
oh yes she did peach looks like she just
finished yelling at a customer service
representative and it's trying to keep
her cool peach looks like a giant
fucking corn dog you done we did good
good right Kermit your turn
unfortunately bud most of these are
about you Cermak got fat
he had touchings disease you insensitive
why does Kermit look so high just like
look at him for a minute he looks like
he finally understands life cement looks
like a mentally unstable rabbit oh yeah
Kermit always looks like he's on the
verge of tears can you be a virgin
scared if you're already crying
Kermit always looks like how you feel
when you know you're about to get an
ass-whupping
I feel like Kermit is the physical
embodiment of the I just came out to
have a good time and I'm honestly
feeling so attacked right now me you
could make a second permit with all of
his extra skin it's all right it's just
stretchy that's all is this stretchy you
felt like a condom over ball Kermit
looks like a snail that has lost its
shell that hasn't noticed yet Carmen
looks like he's been in a bucket of
Windex for too long
Carmen looks like the guy who stands by
the bar and pulls his sunglasses down
looking at young women he's also a
licker this in case he doesn't want to
leer it you he will lick you firmly
looks like the aftermath of an anaconda
eating antelope and then spitting it
back up Kermit's mouth looks like a 90
year old woman sucking on a lemon the
world would have half of its current
amount of carbon dioxide
if Kermit would just stop wheezing give
us some good breathing
he looks like an angry gray potato this
is just the progression of pictures that
shows Kermit morphing into Tilda Swinton
I feel like Kermit is the Michael Cera
of dog karma it looks like he is peed
his pants in public and doesn't know
what to do
if carmit were in The Hunger Games he'd
kill himself before he else got a chance
to kill its Kermit in a nutshell looks
like Chris Bosh not a lot just a little
bit you got to make room for him he's
little why you just flying off the back
just like you wants to die did you guys
like getting roasted thank you for all
of your comments they made me laugh and
all of them are far superior to
jacksFilms dogs so I think that's the
real takeaway here fuck you Sunday and
fucking Klondike get up so yeah make
sure you subscribe to my channel I'll
put on the views every Wednesday slash
Thursday you can alright I'll see you
guys next week bye Marvel's into life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
