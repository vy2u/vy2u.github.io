clicked on this video you saw the title
you saw the thumbnail you know what
you're signing up for okay we even roped
our friend Jeff into this I'm so sorry
how long ago was it a couple weeks three
weeks ago or something there is a tweet
that was getting tweeted at us non-stop
it said Tucson drivers are whack it was
a picture of someone am in a grown man
driving a red convertible holding his
hamster that looks just like at our
hamster people were like is this Julian
oh it's not them it's not no it needs to
be recreated so we're doing that today
we were gonna do it anyways and I feel
like the closer we get to the holidays
the more likely it's just never gonna
happen so we're gonna do it okay we are
going to go rent a red car
all we got to do is rent the car get out
and just go to to something real quick
no we're renting the car first tell them
to do something we probably wear out
that blink-182 song into well I want to
call them first to make sure that they
have one we're gonna get add like
last-minute adds not gonna be subjected
to all of this we're just gonna we're
barely even gonna drive we're gonna park
the car right we're just gonna fake it
don't tell anybody but we're faking
hi I was wondering if you guys had any
red convertibles alright okay thank you
alright we're fuckin over one just ask
if they have the right yeah I was
wondering if you guys had any red
convertibles hi I'm just calling to
check if you had a red convertible
to see if there's any it's gonna get the
point across
no one has a fucking red convertible I
figured that it was gonna be layered
it's like it's not 1995 anymore
something daytime honestly though like
what was that guy doing with this
Hampshire in the daytime they're
nocturnal like I wanted to sleep today
all day a special relationship done
we're going for the ride of a lifetime
son
let me know what I should do the
different pose all right the second pose
close-up on the kissing just about
I'm sorry for taking so many pictures of
my hamster on it
now this now's the hard part we need a
bucket capture I say that we look at the
pictures and figure out the four closest
ones
and then we tweet it out before they put
the video up but you get to pick up but
are you excited
131 I just like leave this on guy the
Starbucks just like I don't know if I
could hit cancel this is interesting
so right now okay that one that one's
looking real solid that one's pretty
damn good okay this might be a good
kissing one that one was actually pretty
you can see his face that one's got a
damn good
you can see you're taking the picture I
think we got the winner's mean it sucks
we weren't able to get a red convertible
like honestly the only difference is
that we didn't really drive anywhere
with that and this guy clearly is
driving somewhere with his hips
where is he going he's definitely in a
Miata okay okay that's number one
okay I got the belly scratch all right
so we got that one yeah that one yeah
what if I retweet that tweet and then
tweet our tweet that's move okay
I think we're doing they were one life
I'm excited I'm excited too like this is
really stupid
but like if we don't do it who is gonna
do it and I hope that you guys
appreciate this because I think this was
a worthy use of our time and I got some
nice don't photos with my son out of it
can you show them the other ones that we
took you're actually born for this
moment doing that's the fucking one
desktop that's someone you tweet that's
all your family and say fuck y'all for
the holidays Tara Jane 23's original
tweet thank you for blessing the
internet I think I just reach me today
[Laughter]
okay I think people are excited I've
literally gotten tweets already being
like can you please stop procrastinating
post your video this is the video it did
take a minute we tried and failed to
rent a red convertible so I do apologize
for not being able to recreate all of
the magic that is the picture but I
think we accomplished what we set out to
do so Jeff sincere thank you to you for
