podcast I'm playing you thought the pie
get this I think is the first time I've
ever made five videos in a series on my
channel ever five celebration or maybe
not I don't know you let me know this
has been one of my favorite things to
make I think the last one that I did was
about a year ago um oh so it's reviewing
bad apps one of my favorite things to do
is to go into the App Store and find
just the were steps and try them out
there's three that I downloaded this
time they cost over $10 week horrible we
are the garbageman of the App Store do
we dive in to the filth and we take out
the trash so this first one is called I
think it's just called blower and all of
the reviews for like blows real air it
really blows air okay I'm intrigued I
guess we we press on yeah it's an
illusion because really negligible out
of air that much air is coming up it's
burning a phone I like that your only
options are on/off demo and share is it
99 cents worth of blowing power no it's
zero cents or The Bling power cuz it
isn't blow I farted that's the more yeah
you can just mix up with your mouth yeah
that's that's really not good this one
is called my talking pet let's take a
picture we've seen apps where just the
the stock dog or cat or whatever talks
but this allows you to make your own to
make your own dog my name is peach and
I'm have a basketball game tomorrow I
have a basketball game Marvel oh my god
this is nightmare
I'm wrong this is not a badass this is
an amazing app can I do Kirby yeah can
we calm happy neighbors okay I just
heard that why did you have to take a
picture of him when he was angry oh he's
photogenic when he's mad let me see it
hold on we got out of some Brown he
looks pretty cuddly okay I like this a
bodacious made it an abomination that's
three fucking dollars so I mean is it
three dollars it has a five star rating
okay I think that's a lot of dessert
this next one is called the skin tanner
I could use get it perfect in every time
cover skin with lotion sighs all right
it's just like a paint brush you like
glowing orange natural beads that have
cost a dollar do you have to post like
you say the picture does it save it with
that title on top of it if they had a
good marketing team it would okay this
one is called brace yourself honestly
some of these apps like it's just about
who can be the most creative and how
they put an ad in it we're gonna give
you some braces just giving yeah it's
it's photoshopping braces on here hi
brace for four years it's not something
you want for that long beach oh my god
Oh Julian take I'll see oh my god stop

nightmare

on white babe
brace yourself okay I have to read this
app like zero it is just like so it's
bringing back way too much what if I
told you you can share it directly to
Facebook with only watching three ads
I'm gonna need you to look away for a
sec please when you go to the
orthodontist and he give you this look
he's giving you braces his heartfelt
he's just watch your teeth to get the
kind of Adonis that didn't go to school
not only did I not good orthodontist

any school ever when you invite me to
participate in these videos I like to
bring something that a tastemaker would
bring someone who knows culture art and
finer things I found an app called fart
box okay can I explain can I explain
some of the features you have a sound
board with one through twenty different
types tongues and moods and fart and you
can range them from gassy to spicy farts
that's gassy not bad but if you want it
to be spicy
my favorite part is is the timer right
so five seconds away you just slide it
and you're like mm-hmm
