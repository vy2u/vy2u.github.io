so this week's video might be a little
bit out of context if you don't pay
attention to the YouTube community but
last week Lord Ryan Higa invented a
challenge where instead of roasting or
making a diss track about other people
you roast yourself and he challenged me
to do the same challenge accepted and I
know I kind of just roasted myself by
watching my old videos but this is a
little different so here is my roaster
self challenge

don't eat beef but if I did I would like

keep your clarinet locked in the closet

all it looked at the nail mark on your
face
