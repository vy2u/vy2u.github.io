going on but I want to say thank you so
much because these two weeks of
Christmas and New Year's every year I
like the two weeks that I take off and I
know it post once a week which doesn't
seem like a lot but after like five six
years it is a lot and you know I just
really appreciate wow I really
appreciate you letting me have these two
weeks to myself and to my family it
means a lot my family was here for
almost an entire week I got to hang out
with my little niece who's going to be

wonderful time and that's time that's
just invaluable to me so thank you so
much for another year of support oh my
