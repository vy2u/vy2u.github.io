deceive you this is going to be what it
says it is for those of you that don't
follow me on Twitter or snapchat I
tweeted like last week I want to get rid
of my eyebrows and I think a lot of
people thought I was joking and then on
snapchat
I showed shaving the outer half of my
eyebrow so I could make a different tail
shape and people were like tweeting it
wrong tweeting it Julian 20 and my mom
like it's Jenna okay she losing her mind
were you worried about me yeah
everyone's thinking I was going like
full Britney Spears but it's a thing
it's not even the first time I've shaved
like the outside half of my eyebrows so
no I'm not going crazy okay I'm just
doing a thing all this week I have been
filling in my eyebrows with different
colors and like making different shapes
on the end and it's been like the
coolest week ever of eyebrow things when
I sat down this morning to make a video
I genuinely was like I think I should
just shave the whole thing and then make
a new eyebrow but then I was like why
would I make a video after that when I'm
holding onto all of the good stuff for
myself know why I want to make a video
after I shave my eyebrows when I make a
video of me shaving my eyebrows plus
also I feel like I would need to offer
some explanation as to why I have
totally different looking eyebrows on my
face I'm having so much fun with just
the outer half I really want to see what
happens if I had to shave the whole
thing off and just have like a clean
eyebrows Lee I think it's going to be
fun I always say life's too short nerds
have really exciting here and I've been
having very exciting eyebrows so I want
to see if I shave the whole thing if it
equals more fun or less fun
it's not like I'm tweezing them or
plucking them or waxing them they're
like they grow back really fast and
they're also mine and not yours so me
shaving my eyebrows is really not going
to affect you in any way I'm excited
let's do this no regrets so let's just
get into it I'll bring you a nice and
close closer than you ever want it see
this is the part I shape is like six
hairs and all I have to shave it is this
razor that I shaved my legs with so pray
for me you like how I did my makeup
other than my brows for maximum eyebrow
effect oh don't laugh at me how is it a
bloodbath it's like too wet
Oh
yeah what oh did I cut my uh uh shaving
with makeup on isn't the best idea I've
ever had
you're sure that oh hell yeah no you're
like really supportive and wonderful
have I ever told you that Jillian I just
you know I love you so much thank you
for not judging me don't do that you
don't like it look at it's not even that
abnormal-looking
just a little song cool as fuck I do not
think I was gonna be this excited wait I
can't get this part right here no here
let me do it I don't know if I trust
come on face I just got it no no
actually I take it back I don't trust
you no you're gonna shave it down like
that you mean oh are with you no no okay
I can't do it it's really hard to get
them all it feels so good though like I
can't describe how it feels it just
feels like you're getting something off
of your face that's been there like your
entire life I feel so good have you seen
that vine of that kid being like what
did you do
I shaved my eyebrows why I don't know
that's me as fuck oh hell yeah all right
I think I'm done oh you know all those
edits of people without eyebrows that
looks so funny
IRL as fuck I think it looks sick oh
hell yeah
Oh Julian you don't like that like it
feels so good oh yeah like it feels just
like it feels really nice I feel like I
would be so fast if I went swimming hey
I'm mad at you yeah I'm so mad at you
right now
this is meant as no disrespect to people
without eyebrows I'm gonna walk you look
I'm kinda down with it every day we wake
up good morning Julian no all right good
night Julian I love you cute touch it we
want to touch it just come touch it
weird so I didn't just want to shave my
eyebrows for you because it takes two
seconds and it's already done
so what I wanted to do is put in some
new eyebrows because now this is my look
so I better start practicing some
eyebrows let's just start with some like
liquid eyeliner I should make some
really angry like cartoon brows right
like you don't have to have your
eyebrows you can have any eyebrows that
you want I like it just hit me are you
angry you just shape actually I'm not oh
my god wait smile oh my god I think it
looks natural I think it just looked
like a butterfly wait we don't have
anything like important coming up where
I need eyebrows hopefully I can just
send them this video and be like it's
I'm sorry just make them go straight
back down yo yes oh my god I think it's
kind of cute
I wipe those off as lovely as they were
because I want to try some other brows
I've done purple blue in red and I did
like our ombre from the beginning is
like color and then it goes into regular
eyebrow color and I really like it I
actually used a liquid lipstick for it
and I want to see what happens if I just
do the whole thing in liquid lipstick
like yeah it doesn't look natural but
you know what has anything about me ever
looked natural
no oh look how fun this is and if
anyone's like we're dry brows go you're
just like you know what I don't fucking
I don't know and I don't care oh I'm
gonna go in with some eyebrow color
okay that doesn't it just looks like
poop I'll be straight up honest with you
though when I was shaving just the outer
half of my eyebrows I felt like I was
waking up every day like can't wait to
do something exciting with the tail of
my eyebrow and then it just makes me get
ready you know with gusto because every
day is like a new little art creation on
your face whereas before I would just
roll out of bed and looks like an
asshole now we just look like a
different type of asshole
the first time I um braid my brows is
because I was watching a glam and gore
video and Mikey was like I'll just take
this like colored shadow and put it in
your eyebrows and I was like what the
fuck I thought you had to dye them like
don't I just look like someone that
wants to party right I came here to
party don't know if you can tell or not
I'm ready let's put some hairs you know
it doesn't really fool me at all
I can tell they're not but good try nope
nope nope nope I mean that's not the
craziest thing I've ever seen in my life
don't knock it till you try it this is
actually pretty cute time for a new look
alright for my next look I think I'm
gonna draw inspiration from one of my
favorite characters Bert Bert's eyebrow
singular extends like the length of his
forehead this is honestly the most fun
I've had with makeup probably in my
entire life I mean I don't hate it
it's a look Julian oh my god it doesn't
look like an eyebrow it looks like a
cool headband would you like to do one
for me yeah so Julian said I'm not
allowed to look until he's finished so I
will be closing my eyes okay feel it all
right let me do the other one okay then
when a diva's life yeah yeah
forgive me indeed incisor yeah I fucking
hate you okay you know this is not what
I asked for you said I could do whatever
I want and I did what I wanted I take it
off will you give me Nike ones yeah you
want Julian yellow Nike swooshes yes we
are you doing this whoosh like to
perfect ha ha ha
that's dope as fuck oh my god I
for me I mean if you weren't on the same
page as me with this eyebrow thing this
should get you on board what would you
do if you saw me on the street and I was
like just do it just do it are you so
terrible how you that's Tobi's fuck wait
will you just write the words hell yeah
on my eyebrows oh yeah from far away
it's like oh look at that she got like
some extra eyelashes on her eyebrows up
close you're like hell yeah on a scale
of like one two get it off me how get it
off me is this that or get the whole
thing all of it in German uh I was
expecting a thirty like get off me three
times it's not that bad no though I
think it's like a 17 this one was
inspired by my grandpa I'm gonna put the
last one in I think I'm just gonna do
some purple and have some fun and live
my life I mean this is an intense look I
probably wouldn't do this all day every
day in order to do this shape but you
know what now I have so much eyebrow
freedom to make whatever I want
Congrats on your freedom thank you thank
you Julian for being non-judgmental and
open-minded to my eyebrow adventures of
you I love you too so yeah I think I'm
just gonna end this now before things
get too weird and I get too much makeup
all over my face thank you for letting
me do this
and being an open-minded open-minded
person this was really fun like maybe
once in your lifetime just go ham and
shave off your eyebrows am I gonna walk
around like this all day every day
probably not am I gonna let them grow
back in probably but you know what I'm
so glad that I did this because now I
know what I look like without any
eyebrows and I can make any shape that I
want I've just you know I've had a great
time I hope that you feel brows fired

looking but it's kind of fucking cool
