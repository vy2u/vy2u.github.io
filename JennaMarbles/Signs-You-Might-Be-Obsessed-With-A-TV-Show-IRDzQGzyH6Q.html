my front hall because I just felt like
sitting somewhere else this is cool
right all right so I realize that I have
a problem step one and fixing your
problems is admitting that you have a
problem and I have a problem I Jenna I'm
obsessed with a television show the show
that I have a problem with is Law &amp;amp;
Order SVU and I hope that some of you
out there can relate to this because
it's getting really really bad like it's
starting to disrupt the rest of my life
which I think you can classify as an
addiction we have an addiction that it's
not healthy like beyond just enjoy
watching it or that it's your favorite
TV show know you're obsessed and you
have a problem so here are some warning
signs that you might be really obsessed
with the TV show you have a
choreographed dance or some sort of
dance that you like to do when the
opening theme song is playing this is
mine
you follow some of the actors on Twitter
even though they never ever tweet but
you want to be sure they are following
them just in case they do ever tweet and
then even if they do you know that it's
just some fake promotional person behind
a desk whose job it is to tweet for them
but you don't care or you like them on
Facebook because you know fucking Elliot
Stabler is not sitting in his facebook
waiting to fucking comment on your post
when you get home you're more excited to
say hello to your TV family than you are
to your actual family you've made a pact
with your significant other that if ever
given the opportunity to sleep with one
of the characters on the show in real
life it's not cheating it's actually
welcomed and they will live vicariously
through you high-five each other fanship
relationships fucking people on TV you
start to use jargon from the show even
though it's totally not necessary and
people most likely have no idea what
you're fucking saying if anyone watches
SVU I like to say somebody cool a bus
you either have or have seriously
considered naming a pet or even a child
after a character on your favorite TV
show for example my mom named me Jenna
after the Jenna in the show Dallas mom
you have a problem you also know you
have a problem when the characters on
the show make you debate like your whole
life choices like oh man I fucking love
that Olivia Benson maybe I'll go back to
school and be a fucking sex crimes
detective just seems like I missed my
calling rape I'm at work today
or say maybe you really like the office
or Parks and Rec and you find yourself
to Bay being like man really want a
fucking boring office job now you just
look so fantastic cares the next one
sees you start to go through withdrawals
if you're not watching the show like you
feel it you start sweating it gets
fucking drum back
I don't watch max yes my dad you've seen
every episode ever even if there's like
300 of them you've watched all of them I
mean that's a lot of fucking out
300 hours you sit down to watch one
episode but then you really watch seven
episodes you like to fall asleep
watching the show it's like your ambien
you have at one point gotten a
subscription of some kind or downloaded
an app for the sole purpose of watching
this show like on a mobile device you
have a problem you will find any excuse
to watch this show at any time I'm at
work right now
should probably watch my show you have
at some point made a username online or
part of your password incorporates
something about the show you might have
a real problem on your hands if you've
ever accidentally had sex with someone
and then called them a character's name
on your favorite show Oh captain Cragen
Oh what I'm sorry you have at some point
change the ringtone on your phone or the
sound that your phone makes to
incorporate something their favorite
show you spent at least one all 24 hour
period without seeing the Sun or leave
your house changing your clothes or
doing anything because you've just been
watching the show all day and all night
if for some reason there's a new episode
on and you can't watch it because you
have to do some real-life shit you just
fucking turn off your phone in the
internet and disconnect yourself from
all reality because you can't have any
spoiler alerts and fuck everyone else
that gets a watcher right now
fuck you you've had a watch party with
your friends and they've all come over
to watch the show together with you and
if they didn't show up that's ok too cuz
your real friends are just on the show
you don't care you desperately want to
live in or go to the school or whatever
imaginary place is on the show you just
want to fucking be there no matter how
many times your mom tells you it's not
really yes it is ok and I want to live
there now we move you move to Dillon
text someone go to Hudson University so
bad you've dressed up for Halloween as a
character on the show even if it's a
super fucking boring costume you don't
care who are you oh I'm Michael from the
office good costume huh it's a fucking
suit you have yelled at a loved one
because you cannot hear your show you
have made or modified your own drink
game-2 the show law and order SVU
drinking game beauty walk shows up
better finish your beer murder you can't
stomach eating dinner without the show
on like you just literally have no
appetite how can I eat this this is so
wrong I need to be watching the babies
you're more wary of new cast members
that you are of like your sister's new
boyfriend who the fuck is this lady on
my show miss Bloggie goryeo Buress means
you're gonna fuckin da every week you
will never be Casey Novak you'll never
lose slam dunk cases like her get the
fuck on my face you like to remind
everyone that's ever watched the show
with you oh I've seen this one if a main
character that you really like ends up
leaving the show you tell yourself it's
it I've done yeah we're watching this
show again it's rude I'll never sing and
then you continue to watch it you're a
regular at your favorite actors garbage
kit you got a tattoo of their face on
your face all right this is getting
really creepy these signs also apply to
YouTube channels because from what some
of you guys tell me you guys have a
problem you watching too many YouTube
videos a problem aside from maybe
forging that actor's signature so that
they could become your legal guardian
level of creepy these are the biggest
signs that you have crossed the
threshold into obsession and you no
longer like the show you have an
obsession but police are not alone
because I have all of these i tattooed
Elliot Stabler space on my face in case
you couldn't tell if you have an
obsession with a TV show fucking tell me
we didn't eat yourself dick so I don't
feel so alone over here I gotta go
because I'm gonna go watch Law &amp;amp; Order
fucking se my face hurts because my
tattoo of Elliot see her ceiling on my
face make sure you subscribe to my
channel put out any beers everyone's and
I can't wait to like tattoo face heals
