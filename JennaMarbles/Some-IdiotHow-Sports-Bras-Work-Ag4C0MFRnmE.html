many sin been invisible toothpaste
please do you see your little tongue
don't you show everyone look at that
little tongue yes today's meals gonna be
a little bit angry a little bit gonna be
sort of a rant so if you don't have time
for that then there's plenty of other
things on the internet for you to
consume yourself with so just go ahead
and click on so I don't think I've ever
done this on my channel before I address
like one thing that someone said or
written but I'm gonna do that today
because it's relevant and also because I
think I can help people what I want to
talk about it has to do with this
fucking absolute dickhead who wrote me
be one of the dumbest things I've ever
read and his name is yuk sell I tug out
if I could say that wrote an article
about how the Olympic Games are quote
killing womanhood let me just read you
some of this article I'm gonna link it
below so you can go look at it he's
Turkish I think the original articles
written in Turkish so this is a
translation but you'll get the gist of
it basically what he's saying is that
their bodies don't look like women and
to take a look at female swimmers
broad-shouldered flat-chested women with
small hips
they're totally indistinguishable for
men their breasts the symbol of
womanhood motherhood flattened into
stubs as they were seen as mere
hindrances to speed
he said the Olympics forced women to
look more like men and the manly are you
look the more successful you are and he
said that you should get bonus points
according to how feminine you looked
otherwise we will destroy the Grace and
they have a tear of women through the
Olympics first of all since we're
objectifying people as tits and ass I'm
going to show you a picture of I tagged
fucking whatever his name is we're gonna
call you ponytail from now on now I
don't think that most people would agree
with ponytail and in fact a lot of the
internet was angry so I'm not gonna try
and slam him for obvious reasons but
unfortunately half the reason why I
wanted to make this video is because
part of what he's saying at least in my
experience a lot of guys don't
understand
tail makes the argument in one statement
that the swimmers are broad-shouldered
and flat-chested with little waists and
then in the other argument he's saying
that they flattened them into stubs and
say that doesn't really make sense
ponytail because on one hand you're
saying it's their body type and then on
the other hand they're saying if their
attire
are they flattening their boobs or are
they just flat-chested you really don't
know what that person looks like is what
you're saying
girls are majestic fucking creatures
just like I said ponytail and you have
been tricked yet again by the optical
illusion in this case of a swimsuit I
made a video on my blog channel a while
back about how to trick people anything
you have big boobs and basically gave a
step-by-step tutorial of how to make
your boobs go up to your neck and look
gigantic and you can do that the other
way so that you can be good at sports
and it's called a sports bra in fact
when I was in college I actually had
multiple people introduce themselves to
me during the day when I looked like a
little kid and then introduced
themselves to me later at a party in a
much different way because they thought
it was two different fucking people and
aside from the obvious hair makeup thing
going on without fail there was almost
always a comment along the lines of whoa
where did those things come from it's
like guys don't understand how sports
bras work it's like boobs are fucking
ghosts and they're only real if they're
in front of your face have you ever
tried running with two giant cantaloupes
attached to your chest now you'll give
yourself a black eye it fucking hurts
when you're doing things with your
boobies bouncing all over the place I'm
sorry that it's not aesthetically
pleasing to you there's a time and a
place for watching girls being sexual
objects while doing something athletic
and it's called a strip club so if you'd
like to go there you can go ahead and do
that sports bras make you look like you
have no tits because you can't do shit
with your titties bouncing all up in
your face we can't expect you to just
know all the secrets of our tops or your
titty club but that doesn't mean that
they're not there how dare you creepy
facial hair ponytail call someone broad
shouldered and flat chested when you
probably have no fucking idea where her
titties look place so I'm gonna show you
what a girl typically
working out would look like versus what
you want me to look like but it's still
fucking me oh hey don't mind me I'm just
a 12 year old boy man girl lady here to
ruin femininity and the Olympics for you
beautiful huh what's that 12 year old
little boy doing here out to win a gold
medal mother fucker
oh hey just the same 12 year old little
boy man girl except I'm not wearing a
sports bra you see a lot of people on
the internet can rant and rave about how
much this guy's a fucking idiot but I
think you really need to go back in your
mind mostly guys and think about all the
girls that you thought were really manly
and gross and like athletic-looking
because they had their 10th squish down
probably a little bit more than you'd
like to admit son just went behind a
cloud so while you're watching the rest
of the Olympics and the rest of life if
you see a girl with some flat titties
while she's working out or competing for
a gold medal it's not her titties it's
her fucking draw sorry that you don't
understand sports bras because us girls
have since the day we started growing
fucking boobs right mobile where your
boobs and your shirt
Carmy look at your ears buddy you look
like Princess Leia you should do all
right make sure you subscribe to our
channel we put out new videos every
Wednesday and we hide our boobs
sometimes when we work out so that they
don't hit us in the face
breaker me yeah you love boobs we'll see
you next week bye uh oh there's the Sun
fucking thanks for showing up asshole</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
