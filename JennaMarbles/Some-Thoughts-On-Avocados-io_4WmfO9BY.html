and I would like to say for the record
that this will go down as one of the
dumbest most pointless videos I have
ever made I'm not gonna say will ever
make there's a lot of crazy things going
on in here so there's definitely gonna
be some worse things that come out of me
but I really wanted to talk about
something that has been bothering me
since I moved to the state of California
which was like five years ago I think
although the weather here is so
disorienting I have no idea how much
time is gone by a lot of people ask me
Jenna why don't you make rants any marks
I'm not really angry about anything I've
done a really good job of like lowering
my blood pressure and just not getting
angry about anything and I was like I'll
let you know when I get angry about
something well if Jenna's gonna make a
rant like something crazy must have
happened some guy must have fucking
punched her in the face no no avocados
got me fucked up here is why avocados
especially in the state of California
are the absolute worst by jenna mourey
Marbles and then you know leave your
retorts for me because I already know
I'm being the unpopular opinion puffin
over here okay I know I am about to get
a lot of real in here plenty more where
that came from
first things first I'm gonna tell you
how I got here the other day and it
wasn't the first time because this has
happened on more than one occasion I
would order a food here in Los Angeles
at a restaurant thinking you know you're
getting a sandwich or you're getting a
salad and you get it and there's a big
fucking pile of avocado on it nowhere on
the menu does it say Oh ah the car oh
sometimes it does actually everything on
the menu usually says covered in avocado
covered in fucking avocado did you want
some avocado you'd if you say no avocado
nine times out of ten you get avocado
why is that well I did some light
Wikipedia on avocados which we'll get
more into in a second but Mexico like
produces over a million avocados a year
Southern California makes like two
hundred thousand of them that's a fuck
ton of avocados guess what avocados do
they suck for a really long time they're
way too hard you can't eat them and then
for like a couple days they're like
perfect and that's the only time you can
fucking eat them riddle me a worst
business plan we have a fuckin million
of these there's like a window this big
when we got to get them down
everyone's throat and charge them money
for them this is impossible to sell
these to people how can we keep them at
a good level of avocado niss we can't so
everyone's rule in California apparently
is just have avocados on everything all
the time forever and charge people for
them and just force-feed them down
people's throats and then they won't
know any better well I am NOT a
California native I grew up in upstate
New York
guess well we have a lot of their apples
oh we got a lot of fucking apples uh do
you know what we don't do is we don't
just slice up a bunch of apples and
throw them on your sandwich when you
didn't ask for them you don't order
fucking stack of pancakes and get it
covered in a giant apple we don't do
that we're thoughtful people we're also
really good at growing things that can
stay fresh for like a week or two and
they don't just turn into actual
diarrhea in a fucking day I ordered a
fucking salad and it had avocado on it
and I wasn't prepared for the avocado
and it just has happened to me one too
many times where I really at this point
feel like I am no longer in control of
my dietary destiny I don't have control
over how many avocados at eat I like
avocados they're delicious I'd say I eat
a fair amount of fucking avocados buck
me up
avocado toast your delicious guacamole
you're pretty fucking good man
I think that everyone here has you spent
brainwashed it's really enjoying
avocados I'm sorry but it's technically
a fruit if that's what we're going with
did I'm avvocato is a fruit I can name I
don't know ten fruits I would rather eat
then an avocado
if you sprinkled on a fucking mango into
my salad I believe ooh amigo that's
surprising and exciting if you sprinkle
on a fuck even a banana into my sandwich
with some peanut butter I would be like
you here's my tip how can I tip you more
this was a delightful surprise
fucking i order a sandwich and you just
throw some avocado in there what the
fuck is this it's so low on the totem
pole of fruits that I don't even get me
started as to how it got picked to be
like on every menu on everything in
Southern California Howlett what the
what the fuck are you people drinking
and thinking I don't understand why
avocado first of all its consistency is
actual baby food my baby niece one of
the first solid foods that she ate was
an avocado guess what she did with it
she spit it out
me too girlfriend because what the
actual fuck is this a baby knows that I
don't care what tumblr tells me I don't
care what Pinterest tells me I don't
want to just be throwing avocados
aimlessly into my meals just because you
say so and you know who I blame
I believe this lady and I blame the
little kid opening avocado on Christmas
those vines I blame them and I blame the
rest of the internet for trying to
brainwash everyone into really liking
avocados I disagree avocados we didn't
grow up eating because we would have
like an 8 year long winter and we can't
just get fucking avocados so I didn't
grow up being like yo mom let me get
some avocado toast she's like not bitch
we have peanut butter get used to this
this is all we get up here
we don't have produce pitch have a seat
over there so when I moved to California
I was kind of shocked at the amount of
avocado it was a body
culture shock to the avocados and at
first I was like okay this is cool cuz
you guys got your fucking avocados from
Mexico and shit but you know what else
Mexico makes a lot of coffee it's not
like they're over here sprinkling coffee
on your tacos no just avocados I think
that this is all one giant big fucking
propaganda brainwashing thing into
making you think that you really like
guacamole and avocados when you could
take it or leave it
eat let alone fucking pay extra for it
you know who else loves avocado subway
they go together perfectly
you guys are perfectly matched for each
other because what the fuck and you I'll
leave it up to you to figure out which
one is which but fuck man
here's a perfect example of why avocados
don't make sense to me if avocados are
so plentiful in Mexico in Southern
California why when you go to a Chipotle
is the one and only thing on the menu
that costs extra
guacamole that is like a Jedi mind trick
to get you to think that guacamole and
avocados are worth more than they are no
to the statistics of how many fucking
avocados there are here that you just
comfrey for showing up at a Chipotle you
see what they're doing they're tricking
you into thinking that you want
guacamole and avocados it's not even
economical to make so you buy an avocado
you mash it up for your friends to make
some guacamole guess what
it's all fucking brown by the time
everyone's ready to eat it ooh gross I
don't want this what the fuck man it
literally spoils while it's waiting for
you to eat it I have an idea of how many
calories I'd like to eat for lunch Oh
guess what you just got super fucked in
the face Jenna because someone threw a
whole avocado on there and now you're
gonna eat like 200 extra calories you
didn't want to when I try and take you
off of something that you were on
avocado
you've already spread your fucking Bowie
plague all over everything
avocados make me nervous because they
make me feel like I don't have a choice
the avocado is also known as the
alligator pear sounds fucking deadly and
not okay I know right I don't want to
eat alligator anything pear yes
alligator pear no when they trace back
the original word avocado they get a
bunch of Spanish stuff and then they
basically get to the word testicle an
avocado is a testicle it's the testicle
of fruits that they got right so
avocados can be harmful to the following
animals cats dogs cattle goats rabbits
rats guinea pigs birds fish and horses
can be severely harmed or even killed
when they consume them any fruit that
can kill a horse
is not my friend and the people that are
allergic to avocados they either get it
like in there tree pollen II like mouth
and throat or abdominal pain vomiting
and that can sometimes be
life-threatening it's a real thing it
exists on Wikipedia avocados kill people
avocados are just like the fucking
little wayne of fruits they'll just work
with everyone bacon will work with you
breakfast will work with you dinner will
work with you Mexican food get over here
this vine that's been going around I'm
not trying to hate on this lady okay she
can slight and do your thing lady and
this was a whole song where she talks
about lots of other fruits and
vegetables and get down
that's all but this one part it's got me
so fucked up for those of you that are
sensitive to guacamole material you
might want to click away during this
part because it is a doozy wait time out
why are you peeling the avocado
nobody does that nobody peels an avocado
you cut it in half and then you take up
the seat and you scoop it out who is
peeling an avocado she doesn't even know
what she's talking about she just got a
message from the government probably it
said you know what you should do is make
a soccer ball or komali it makes
everyone wanna walk like guacamole cry
bug and up brah well Buganda
they're trying to get you to eat the
guacamole and avocados that you weren't
previously gonna eat until you heard
this amazing song and you were like damn
that lady is fucking slaying right now
you know what I should eat some
guacamole propaganda and this durable
child that got an avocado for Christmas
oh you know we should give our kid for
Christmas a fucking avocado cuz you know
what he doesn't even really like him and
he's being fake-nice because he's a baby
gentlemen that's what's going on here he
opens it Thanks fake fake Thanks that's
the thanks that you give when you get
something that you don't even want
because no one wants an avocado for
Christmas or their birthday or their
lunch feel free to disagree with me
because this is definitely the worst
tangent I've ever gone on about anything
and if you stand with avocado 2k15 you
do you my friend but you know what just
think about it for a second cuz
something's not right here we shouldn't
be eating this many avocados if I leave
here never eating another avocado for
the rest of my life I'm totally fine
with that the actual texture the actual
taste the actual avocado itself is just
so wildly underwhelming even guacamole
which is delicious you got to put a shit
ton other stuff in there to make it
taste like guacamole at that point it's
not even the avocado that tastes good
why do you think your burger tastes so
good with an avocado on it because it's
a burger and not an avocado this is why
I can't do rants anymore because I'm so
involved in my own
about avocados but this concludes using
my closing statements about avocados and
I just think that they're a little bit
fucked up and corrupt I'm actually
sweating from this conversation and you
know what I'm not going to hydrate
myself with is an avocado because it's
not hydrating at all I just feel like
I'm being force-fed avocados and I just
want to close my mouth and say no thank
you
once and for all like I'll let you know
when I want an avocado not the other way
around and I'm tired of being treated
like an avocado shredder make sure you
subscribe to my channel although after
this video I don't know why the fuck you
would I would be like that bitch is
crazy and needs a hobby I'll see you
guys next week bye and I stand against
avocados 2k15 sorry not sorry
I fucking hate myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
