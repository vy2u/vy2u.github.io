gland so I just got back from playlist
live last weekend which was awesome
amazing but it's just so it's so nice to
have human interaction with people and
hug and touch each other and feel like
we're real so did that last weekend and
then in two weeks I'm actually going to
Germany but not like a fan thing I think
I'm gonna sit in a room full of
grown-ups and talk about Internet stuff
yeah it's getting a little bit stressful
excuse me while I try not to lose my
mind ah freak out over I asked you guys
on my facebook what you wanted to see
this week and one of the responses by
Candice Stratton was to do the dog IQ
test with the dogs I laughed really hard
just looking at it because I know that
Marvel's is definitely gonna fail I know
some of you guys don't like videos that
are just me like doing life stuff um but
that's fine I'll see you guys later
but if you if you have a dog and you
want to do this IQ test you can thank
Candice for sending me this link peach
is a puppy still though so I'm not
thinking she's gonna do too great but
we'll see Kermit I think is gonna win
marbles is it'll lose by a landslide if
he can even participate you score two
points each time they do something
that's highly intelligent and they
complete the task quickly or even really
at all then they get a - like a medium
response is like a 1 and if they don't
do it they get a 0 but I'm really
excited to do this like this is
something I would do in my free time I
just decided that I really
it to be a video so it could be on the
internet forever so that's one when you
do today I'm so pumped I want to laugh I
want all the dogs so I hope you're
excited because we're about to find out
who is my smartest dog and it's not be
ready okay ready
so the first one says that you're
supposed to take a towel and put it
around their head and see how long it
takes him to get out of it okay ready go
are you scum fuck get out get out
Oh marvel we're going into the red zone
of not even ever but you've been tired
onion we're are you below average
intelligence that like just stand up and
try get out of the towel give the towel

the timer
minute 52 seconds nettie Beach I think
you're gonna do better if they're sons
brothers 34 seconds very good yeah good
girl okay so it says the average is 15
to 20 seconds but in comparison I think
she deserves a point for getting 32 okay
PG you have one good girl especially
since the other two took a minute yeah
so the second one you're supposed to
take some treats treats yeah and put
them under a towel someone's supposed to
be holding him but I don't think my
believes that so I'm going to put them
under the towel and get to see how long
it takes them to find them if ever okay

where they go I know has object
permanence all mobile you Jane very
close is very determined to get 10
determined points

disappear then someone else come even so
