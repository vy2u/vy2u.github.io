family time okay and we get to have the
only time - right mom Debbie are you
ready to slay me Debbie
slay me no one even invited you she
doesn't even go here okay well you're so
good at weird okay if Jenna was born a
boy
what would her name is bill we had I had
this picked out in fact I have the piece
of paper that son names are written on
her name was gonna be Benjamin Benjamin
I would've been a much better boy than a
winner because every day I just wake up
and do the best that I can okay can you
take a panoramic photo we can do that
right now no we just took a panoramic
picture and it came out beautiful mom
did you like it oh yeah
what are you expecting then I don't know
I
little of life anymore well no I don't
mean you have so much to live for
do you ever wish that jenna Marbles
chose a different career Paul no no
because she's very happiness okay
does Jenna give her sense of humor from
you utter death oh because we all know
you're hilarious
well I apparently I'm only hilarious
when I'm not trying to be true when I am
trying to be hilarious it's great money
at all it's cringe miss Jana a good
childhood choose younger she was a
wonderful girl until she was about 13
then what happened mother
the demons it's cute I do do anything
my it's like me stars you're gonna what
what are you getting there we're here
when you get in you can pull my hair out
who pull that elastic oh then your hair
fuck no actually my other favorite
memory of Jenna was when she it was we
have a chip knee in our house in this
girl came over that yes I told them on
for like days I'm like mom pretty sure
there's a squirrel in the fireplace she
was like nothing yeah and then wasn't
gonna open it up and it's just sitting
there and didn't I catch him in a pillow
cases on that's exactly right and you
were like losing your shit I was like
mom can we keep it no I caught him what
was the first time you ever mad at Jenna
and why Oh
so every day first like years she would
get up from the table in the middle of
dinner go over to the door say see you
in Florida and then go down the stairs
and go to the bathroom and come back and
I would be like Jenna do not get up on
the table
and in the middle of dinner it was like
that it got to be like hysterical like I
wonder what time but but at what point
in dinner is she gonna get upstairs you
know get up from the table interrupt the
entire meal and go down and tell us so
maybe like that I remember it being
endearing but either the first 150 times
I think I thought it was was it really
every night so many nights it was funny
clearly because we're so laughing is
there a difference between how Jetta
acts with you slash family and how she
acts on YouTube no I don't know how to
break this to you but exactly how you
see it
is how it is in real life yeah but I I
don't sit around like swear all the time
like people are like oh you're way more
calm there's a time and a place to be
out of control so sometimes I meet
people and they say open swears you know
did you like swear a lot and I said no
we didn't swear at all except for that
one time when we were again at the
dinner table and put you guys were much
older than and debit well yeah Devin was
what like 16 or 15 or something if I was
like 13 and he's just sitting there
eating dinner and my brother pictures
looks up from his plate he goes mom I'm
the man of the house I declare open
swearing my mom is like crying you just
couldn't do anything and then you're
like okay stop and Devin was like I was
serious if you could change anything
about Jannah what would it be that she
wouldn't like poke me when she was
younger it was either she didn't want to
talk to me at all or she wanted to be
like right next to me every minute every
single
something like that I wouldn't talk to
you at all well you know you'd be like
you know kind of in a snit so not not
just mean it you know just like you need
your space you'd be off you know in your
room or something being quiet or you
would like just like glom onto me and be
like sitting right next to me or no
squawking oh honey I need to walk I
remember I used to take your hand like
this and I sit the man that you sleep
like what's the craziest drunk
conversation you've ever had I'd say
recently a mother's day when you went
into like death about how much white
trash we are that's the way that you
guys used like reuse birthday cards and
all right yeah well my grandmother used
to cut out the name of where it was like
to someone and from someone she'd cut
that out then she would give that card
to somebody else and then my mother
would put a step further and she would
just photocopy the card and then have
even just like a piece of paper that
said like happy birthday should give you
a photocopied
that is white trash yeah see that's
right I get it it's not my fault it's
her fault and her mother's fault and her
mother's was your daughter a bitchy
teenage girl yeah I think the the low
point was was trying to teach you my
dude oh my god I can't remember a time
in my life when I was so angry and
frustrated there trying to learn how to
