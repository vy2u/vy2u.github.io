hair today okay
just really thirsty what I would like to
talk about today is the fact that I find
my own gender baffling there are just
many things that girls do that I don't
understand myself included mind you I've
already gone into some topics about why
girls hate each other girl crushes
things of that sort but these are sort
of small little life things where I'm
like what are we doing what are we doing
I don't know what's going on here and
what's bad is that part of the reason
why we're so magical as a gender is
because we're like fucking pinatas like
we're all full of surprises you don't
know what's inside you think it's a pony
and then it's full of like nips or you
think it's a fucking Mexican hat and
then it's full of tootsie rolls like you
never know what's gonna be inside of a
pinata you just can't tell so maybe
you're not supposed to understand why
you do these things I certainly don't
hopefully you can relate to some of
these things because if you can't I'm
gonna feel really weird over here alone
by myself so without further ado here
are some things that I don't understand
about girls first thing I don't
understand about girls is something that
max referred to earlier as GU hoarding
now GU hoarding is when your bathroom is
just full of half empty half used beauty
products please tell me I'm not alone in
this because I have like four bottles of
shampoo all them are like this empty
have like six mascaras don't even get me
started on lip glosses lip glosses are
like my kryptonite in the store when you
see them this one has gold sparkles and
the one that you have at home in that
same color has sort of a Mavi gold
sparkle so you need this one right
because you don't have it it's different
no matter how many lip glosses I own if
I am in a store long enough that sells
lip glosses I'm leading with a lip gloss
to make matters worse this is the more
embarrassing part I on top of buying lip
glosses that I don't need you the need
to take them everywhere with me as if
I'm just using pounds of lip gloss every
single day like I'm reapplying this
stuff every four seconds like I need it
like it's my EpiPen like you don't need
all of this lip gloss with me let me
just show you the inside my purse this
is very
quickly gonna turn into what's in my
purse video but let me just show you hi
Kermit what's in my purse right now in
terms of lip products I just pulled all
of these out of one pocket in my purse
you know the pocket that's supposed to
be like for your credit cards as know
you got chapstick
we got minty gloss we got serum we got
like eight hundred different glosses
their different textures we got some
lipstick we got fucking we haven't even
gotten into the inside of my purse yet
that's just in this little pocket guy
thing right here so that I can have
easier access to them as you go a little
deeper we've now found more products we
found a lip thing that changes color
when it touches your skin and it turns
more skin color it turns the color of
your lips holy shit I need that science
we got more lipstick we got a pencil we
got more gloss the same color gloss as
the one in the other one I need to what
if something happens to the first one I
don't know what if I have a cut and I
also want a bomb that I could put on a
cut what if I need peach sparkles and
you'd think a good way to control
yourself would be you know I'm gonna buy
a lip gloss and I'm not gonna buy a new
one until I finish an old one you'd
think that that's how you would approach
life but for those of us that have
almost zero self control when you see
anything that falls under the motif of
pink and sparkly this is a problem and
what's bad is that I like everyone
that's in my purse and yet I feel the
need to keep looking for more like I'm
gonna find some Holy Grail lip gloss
that I don't have yet in my bathroom I
have a drawer just full of like half
used moisturizers and soap and there's
nothing wrong with it but then I go to
the store and I get all like hmm I
wonder if I'm gonna like this one better
but you never do you never like the next
one better you always like it the same
as the first one they all just do the
same thing they all have the same
ingredients they make your face clean
they make your face not as dry and they
make your lips shinier and Pinker I have
to give some credit where credit is due
here gooo hoarding is an
evil way to classify what this problem
is it's go hoarding shampoo it's goo
conditioner goo lotion goo lip gloss goo
it's all goo doesn't matter where you're
putting it what it's for it's goo I am a
goo hoarder I Jenna and the goo hoarder
and then unlike the show hoarders where
they just are a hoarder in their house
you feel the need to carry around a
bunch of stuff with you to hoard
wherever you go what the fuck am i doing
and I say I don't understand about girls
is sort of twofold because I can
understand and then I don't understand
just give me a second to explain so the
first thing and don't understand is
girls and purses I understand every
other accessory there is jewelry shoes
get it alright why you want more than
one
but purses I don't really understand I
get the different sizes that they're for
different things if you wanna have a
regular-sized one to carry around in the
day and a smaller one for night or like
another big one for like you go to the
beach you wanna have like a backpack I
understand when they have a different
use because of their different shape or
size fine but then why do you need more
than one of those and the reason I asked
that because I am such a thing hoarder
to have more than one like daytime bag
just sounds like a terrible idea what if
you forget something
why take the time to take all of your
shit out of one purse to put all your
shit in another purse it's like if
you're Batman and you have like six
different belts that you wear oh fuck my
my batarangs were in my other belt I
guess we're all fucked now soon I'm
saying I feel like there's too much
opportunity there to forget some really
important things when you need that let
me just give you an example of things
that I would be like oh you know I don't
need to put that into my other purse I
probably won't need that today true fair
but what if it happens today
I wouldn't put this in my new purse what
if I was hungry huh cards what if I get
bored doggy bags what if my dog poops
then you don't have a bag that's
embarrassing that makes you look like an
irresponsible person bracelet and then
the rest of it is just pure garbage
I carry a sack full of garbage I would
say 65% of my purse is just garbage 10-4
and snacks yeah sure you might not
always need a flashlight but guess what
if I were to switch my purses on a
regular basis the flashlights probably
wouldn't make it into the new purse by
only having one bag you are potentially
saving your life and is all be
apocalypse because I'm flashlight I
don't know about you guys sometimes I
get angry what guys like oh can you put
this in your purse and hold on to it
doesn't like what am I your mule as if I
can't afford to put any more shit inside
my purse this is also important to me I
need to carry it everywhere I go
actually I want to eat this the last
thing I want to talk about because this
might as well be part one is what we
find to be scary girls will find things
that are moderately scary to be
terrifying and then things that are
actually terrifying to be like whatever
for example your average girl might find
a scary movie
very scary but then amassing hundreds of
thousands of dollars in school loans or
thousands of dollars in credit card debt
is just like a walk in the park no big
deal
what the one that applies to me more is
I don't like the basement I am scared of
the dark but if a strange man corners me
in the alley I'm like hey man what's
going on what are you doing fucking what
I can't tell you why I'm like that it
just it is what it is maybe someday I'll
come back to revisit this topic because
there's questions about myself that I
don't understand about myself denote
event I hope you do extreme Kermit

our channel we put interviews every
Wednesday and you love you forever
