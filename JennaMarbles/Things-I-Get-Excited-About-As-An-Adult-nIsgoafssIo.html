up by his armpits to fire my armpits so
this week I wanted to make a video about
something that I realized because Julian
ordered us a present and I got likely
too excited about it you know I had to
really take a step back for a second be
like wow Jenna really Wow and it has to
do with being an adult and getting
excited about things as an adult I am
going to be 29 years old in the fall and
I am certainly not a child I am a full
grown adult I've been realizing this
about myself that I get more and more
excited about some of the dumbest things
I could ever imagine according to most
cultures religions legal things whatever
people are adults between anywhere from
13 to 18 so most of the people that
watch these videos are adults physically
I think mentally being an adult is very
different because my definition of adult
doesn't have to do with your age and
I'll tell you how to get here okay I
came up with this definition of adult um
Thanksgiving where my mom was here and
we had just baked a lovely pie and it
was in the oven we're getting ready and
I started thinking to myself hey you
know when that pie comes out I have no
way of serving it because all I have are
a bunch of forks and knives so why did
you even bother baking a pie if you can
just like stab it out with a fork and
then serve it to somebody in a pile why
did you even cook that pie bitch if
you're not even gonna serve it to me
fuck so Thanksgiving Day I ran out I
went to the store that was open and got
a pie server so that I could properly
serve this pie thought falling all apart
and you know being weird and I was kind
of upset about it because my mom's here
like having a glass of wine everyone's
like cooking and enjoying the day and
Here I am going to the store trying to
get a fucking pie server and I was angry
and I come home I like put the pie
cutter on the counter and I looked at my
mom and I was like mom you know what the
definition of being adult is buying
things that you hate I don't want a pie
server
I don't want to have it I don't want to
spend my money on it why am i buying
this right now because you have to it
because you're an adult you don't have
to buy a pie server it's not about that
Geron saying I think that regardless of
your age or you know wherever you are in
the spectrum of dolt hood you're only an
adult when you have to spend your money
on things that you hate that to me is
being an adult like if you are a college
student and you're going to college what
do you have to spend a shit ton of money
on books I don't want to buy all these
books I'm not even gonna read half of
them I have to carry them around all day
every day I don't want to spend money on
that you are an adult by a friend paper
towels and toilet paper two of the worst
things to spend your money on ever
because you always have to you for some
reason are always out of toilet paper
and out of paper towels and I can't
account for most of where it goes I
don't know where it goes why do I always
need to buy this adult I don't know a
fucking a chair whoever wants to buy a
chair not me I don't want to buy any
chairs I don't wanna buy anything sit on
a couch why can't I just use my couch or
my bed for everything why do I need a
chair Oh cuz once you have a you know a
little more space cuz you're in adults
and you know fill it with chairs and
shit it's stupid trash cans you know
what's stupid having to buy a trash can
with your money dollars what are you
gonna fill this with literal actual
trash hey got my first paycheck shit to
add I need a trash can so better go buy
one of those this to me is too real when
you buy your first set of coasters you
are officially an adult not someone gave
them to you you bought a set of coasters
yet there's no surface in your house
that's gonna get ruined if you put a wet
drink on it and then when someone comes
over you tell them we have coasters
full-blown adult a you are all the way
adopted that being said though what I do
get to do things that I like or spend my
money on things that I like as an adult
I like relish it okay it's very exciting
and the things that I get excited about
are very different than what I used to
get excited about which is only normal
and you know what I don't care I don't
care I am full-blown adulting and ain't
no shame in my game anymore okay I'm
gonna tell you the entire purpose that I
made this video is because Julian is
very sweet gift to us bought a crock-pot
on the Internet
and it came to the house and I'm really
fuckin excited about okay I like almost
lost my shit first of all what a sweet
thoughtful gift
okay the gift of like slow cooking
amazing second of all I got excited
about the words crock-pot
someone said crock-pot and I said Oh
funny you should say that Julianne
because I already have like 12 recipes
into my Pinterest board and I only have
one Pinterest board okay and it's called
feed me this is not new for me either
because I got excited about a bunch of
my appliances like for example when I
went to Bed Bath Beyond which is you
know adult heaven I hate all of these
things yet somehow I love them all and I
brought coupons I went to Bed Bath &amp;amp;
Beyond years ago to buy my toaster oven
because my oven oven wasn't working so
what do you do you buy a small oven to
place on top of your oven oven to be
your new oven and so I asked the guy are
any of these toaster ovens like better
or worse than the other ones you know I
don't want to violate a five dollar
toaster oven but like can you engage
them a little bit for me let me know
what I'm working with here and he looked
at me he was like ah this one he was so
all really dramatic about how great this
toaster oven was right and I was like
okay you sir have a full-blown case of
the adult 'yes it's just a toaster oven
and i think that i had said that to him
in person he was like no no no no you'd
understand it is just the best thing in
the whole world and i didn't really
believe him until i brought it home cuz
of course I bought it cuz he sold me on
it how are you gonna say no no oh this
one kids they know too that I'm sold
it is baller is bad the fuck-ass and
then I realized that I too have a case
of the adult thieves a crock-pot and a
toaster oven lot also on the note of
appliances I was as a child very excited
about one appliance it was an electric
can opener his name was Larry and I
loved him so much then when I was a camp
my mom would not write me one postcard
she would write me two postcards one
from her and one from Larry the can
opener okay so I had a problem with
Larry but it's not because I loved the
way that he opened cans he was my friend
okay it's different now I just really
really liked appliances the next thing I
get excited about as an adult is do
doing nothing I love to do nothing like
I've never met anyone else that likes to
do nothing there's nobody that I've ever
met that likes to do nothing as much as
I do and what's crazy to me about it is
that as a kid doing nothing is a form of
punishment and or torture go timeout
you're being bad go to timeout and you
sit and you do nothing it is the most
torturous experience ever right if it's
the summertime
my biggest fear growing up was like
being bored oh my god I don't want to be
bored what am I supposed to do right I
need to do something all my friends are
out of time I don't ride my bike to a
7-eleven and get some bubble gum before
I die of boredom and now I get so
excited about the possibility of just
doing nothing like the more nothing the
better like I'm the type of person that
will go lay outside stare at the sky
like that's how hard I like to nothing
I've also realized the importance of
doing nothing because it doesn't serve
for nothing it quiets your brain you
have better thoughts it's a you know
shut off whenever I have like a day off
or something where I don't have to do
anything you know what I'd like to do
nothing nothing I'll just sit on the
couch and do nothing I would say my
passion in life is nothing it's my
favorite thing to do and I hike it well
do anything to get to nothing I love it
the next thing I get excited about as an
adult
is pretty specific but it is amazing if
you have never went to a store and
invested you know ten to fifty dollars
however fancy you want to get here but
like ten dollars and get you a good one
a new pillow girl what an investment
that is it's economical it's wonderful
it feels so nice you're like why didn't
I get a new pillow a long time ago I
don't know a friend because you didn't
think of it get a new pillow the next
thing I get excited about as an adult is
making a new friend it's really exciting
because when you're kid like yeah maybe
you have like one or two close friends
but you're like in school you're
surrounded by people your age like
everybody's sort of doing the same stuff
you're all in the same place every has a
lot in common but as an adult I don't
know about you I will speak for myself
but I fucking hate every
I hate everyone you suck you suck
everybody fucking sucks I don't know
what the fuck everyone is doing and when
you make a new friend it's really really
exciting you don't suck it all where
have you been
I've been looking for you everywhere
feel like a fucking unicorn they're
looking for you in a sea of people I
want a punch in the face another thing
they get excited about as being an
adult's is when you go somewhere and you
need to be 18 to be there even like a
website or you know whatever and you're
not lying anymore
and the last thing that I get excited
about by being an adult is being on the
ground
I know fucking it's a little weird but
when I was younger I used to love
rollercoasters flying I want to go
bungee jumping and skydiving is that a
submarine we should get in it let's go
swim with motherfucking sharks one of
the best and worst things about being an
adult is that you get exposed to vast
amounts of information and experiences
so I have come to the conclusion that
you know where I want to be the fucking
ground if I wake up today and I'm on the
ground it's gonna be a good day I wake
up on an airplane fuck I'm gonna go
upstairs I'm gonna hug my pillow on the
ground and I'm gonna love it and I'm
gonna do nothing that's what I get
excited about tell me what you like and
are excited about as an adult if you're
older than 13 to 18
I think if I aren't too bad it could be
worse hopefully you're like me and every
once in a while you just get like way
too excited about something where you're
like that little part in your brain is
like fuck is wrong with you the other
part of your brain is like oh no man but
Brooke pot does anyone want to come say
goodbye okay my dog's fucking hate
everyone
that's how you know that there are
adults because they stopped caring about
me I am now their food machine make sure
you subscribe to my channel I put out
new videos every Wednesday / Thursday
let me translate what they just said to
you that's okay I'm literally gonna go
check on the crockpot
cuz I'm making some shit I'll see you
