doing in your kitchen I don't know it
felt like sitting in a chair today
because I am lazy yes Ganju legs get all
cramped when you're sitting cross-legged
in your bed all the time then I felt
like sitting in a chair if you notice
like I cleaned up for you I'm such a
piece of shit so today I wanted to talk
about something that's not so like haha
silly funny I was tweeting yesterday
some examples of how bad I am at
basketball and this girl was like you
should make a whole video about things
you're bad at I was like you and that's
kind of an excellent idea because I am
bad at many things I don't think it's a
bad thing I think that you're allowed to
suck and a lot of stuff especially when
you're young and you think you have to
be so good at everything gotta be the
best no you don't you can't openly suck
at so many things and guess what that
makes you booking regular and I really
hate when people are like oh nobody's
perfect
okay elaborate like what do you suck at
no one ever describes the actual things
that they suck at they just tell you
that it's okay I'm gonna give you some
concrete things that I am terrible at it
hopefully make you feel better about
yourself so without further ado here are
some things that I suck at first thing
that I suck at is basketball
I had three solid examples of how much I
suck at basketball I used to play
basketball against my neighbor as a kid
he's a grown man he only had one hand I
would lose him
I'm that bad at basketball my brother
and I would play horse you know where
you have to make the same shot of
someone else and if you miss you get a
letter you saw a horse you lose I would
have to play horse exhalation point
question mark etc because I needed all
of those extra letters or else it would
be a very fast game the crowning glory
of how I knew how bad I was at
basketball was my old apartment I used
to live across the street from this park
one day I was playing knockout with the
kids
this fucking kid on rollerblades wearing
a backpack beat me in knockout now I
want you to really break this down with
me for a second first of all I don't
think he knew how to use the brakes
he was just like slowly coasting with
his backpack on you would knock his ball
out and he would like have to
rollerblade and carefully pick up his
basketball every time it wasn't like
right in front of him and then
rollerblade back shakily get in line and
he fucking bit me he knocked me out like
within the first round this kid got me
out I think he was between the ages of
10 and 12 like come on I mean you can
only take that once in your life before
you're like I should go sit down forever
from basketball the next thing I suck at
is hair
you ever see my hair and it looks like
shit that's because I literally did it
half-assed I do like half of my hair the
front half and then the rest of it fuck
it next thing I suck at I can never make
my eyeliner match the same on both eyes
no matter how many times I try you like
this might look okay to you but if you
ever saw me in person you'd be like that
shit is jacked up like it does not look
even close to the same the next thing I
suck at really actually kind of funny I
cannot estimate numbers if there was a
group of people in a room I cannot tell
you unless I count them how many people
are there I could estimate less than a
hundred more than two or just tell me to
quickly look at something I want how
many things are there I have no fucking
clue I can't my brain just doesn't do it
like you know in elementary school and
stuff when they put M&amp;amp;Ms in a jar and
they're like oh guess I'm in here in
here new winter prize I would always
just look and be like fuck I don't know
fifty seven billion
I cannot estimate numbers time fine
distance sure numbers no way I suck at
doing laundry and that's too full first
part of it is that I suck at actually
doing laundry on more than one occasion
I have actually gone to a store to buy
underwear because I didn't feel like
doing my laundry that's bad that's
really bad the second part of how much I
suck at doing my laundry I just throw
everything in the dryer like I'm too
lazy to sort my clothes and the things
that can go into the dryer or not and
then if it gets ruined the way that I
justify that in my mind if I can't put
it in the dryer I don't want it like how
hard would it be to take that out of
your dryer pile and you know line dry it
it's not I just suck at it while we're
talking about clothes
I still get actually putting my clothes
away correctly here's where your clothes
are supposed to go here's where I put
them another thing I suck at is doing my
dominant hand when I'm painting my nails
my left hand always comes out all like
nice and pretty like that normal and
then my right hand OS comes on like that
and then even when you go in and try and
fix it you just suck it up more side
note though that's not true of my toast
I'll show you why you cannot unsee what
I'm about to show you click away if you
don't like feet
alright alright this is why I don't suck
at doing my toenails so I can spray them
like little hands
they're like little monkey hands I stuck
a chess because I think it's boring it's
too many different pieces let's play
checkers like checkers better because
it's for children I suck at saying no to
my dogs
I mean cheese marbles giving me
puppy-dog eyes that he wants cheese okay
you can has cheese the other thing I
really suck at it's getting weird
colored in here is history this is a
secret you can't tell anyone this I'm
gonna tell you and one garter in high
school I got a D in history a date
hopefully you suck at things too so then
I won't feel so that an embarrassed I
feel weird we keeping you up you say
make sure you subscribe to our channel
user Wiz they say by Homer by Homer
o'clock I'll paint your nails level
nobody say I'm a man you respect me
woman knows me I'm talking to myself
say see you next week goodbye titties</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
