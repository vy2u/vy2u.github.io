up there
Oh my hair is red it's exciting this is
a stupid video there's no reason why you
should ever really care about this
whenever I'm being consumed by like a
thought or idea or a thing the best way
for me to cleanse myself of whatever is
consuming me is to verbalize it and talk
about it and in the past I made a video
called apps are ruining my life and
after I made that video I significantly
decreased my game playing on apps which
I'm very proud of and I also made a
video called junk food confessions and
you know what since then I have not
eaten a bag of croutons for dinner so
clearly for me when I sit around and
talk out loud about whatever is
consuming me it helps me so if you
wouldn't mind I would like to do that
this week with my fleet gasps no fucking
red ass hair bad guys I wanted to talk
about some things that are currently
ruining my life yeah okay ruining is
kind of a harsh word but to me I feel
like they're really interfering with my
ability to be a human every day and I
wanted to share them with you because
you know it go through phases sometimes
it's a television show that's ruining my
life sometimes it's a puppy that's
ruining my life what are you even doing
even back there even and hopefully it
will force me to confront these things
that are keeping me from human aim and
be able to human better because the
first step in having a problem is having
the problem and then admitting it and
then getting better about it and then
not doing it the first thing that's
ruining my life is a game called elder
scrolls honestly I started playing more
video games after I uploaded the videos
I suck at video games 1 &amp;amp; 2 after those
two videos someone told me that I should
get the game elder scrolls and I'm
getting scared for my life I don't want
to know how many hours I put into this
game and I clicked on my profile where
it tells you how far into the game you
are it said five percent and I'm getting
genuinely concerned that I like first of
all I've opened Pandora's box of video
games it is so fun and I can't fuckin
stop and I'm only playing one game it
makes me not want to do it every second
of my free time I don't want to go out
on the weekends I want someone that
wants to hang out and play fucking video
games with me and I've met lots of gamer
people in my life and
I'm having a hard time I'm asking you
honestly when you're out in the world
how can you pretend that you're having
fun because all I want to do is go home
and play elder scrolls it's also gotten
to the point where I've convinced myself
that I'd be happier if I lived in Elder
Scrolls World and I woke up every day
and I just had to do some quests and I
had to fight people make some alchemy
bottles and then drink them and make
food and eat oh and make yourself a
sword that's fucked up
that's so book I wish I could live in
Elder Scrolls that's fucked up like what
is it where is that gonna get me in life
nowhere like I'm waiting to be an
episode of Law &amp;amp; Order where they like
bust in my house and they're like oh my
god something terrible happened and I'm
like what I don't even know where I am
anymore I'm like living fake life in
fake world if I go missing just send
someone to my house I'll be here playing
Elder Scrolls the second thing that's
right in my life is soda water I said
that recently to a friend they're like
you mean seltzer and I was like no soda
water fuck out of here like I can't
soccer I'm drinking it right now and I
don't drink regular water I'm just
drinking soda water I think that that's
fucked up and wrong and probably not
right but I like soda water cuz it's
cold I could put it in my fridge and
this isn't tastes like mango well it's
really good so why would I drink not
this when I could drink this I'm also
curious if anyone knows if drinking that
much carbonation is good or bad for you
because I have a feeling it's bad for
you there's gonna be like a study that's
like oh drinking a bunch of soda water
just makes you like explode or implode
or if it makes you implode I'm gonna be
the first person that does promise you
that much
and I don't even finish them I stink
like half of it forget about it go to
the fridge get another one my entire
house is covered in cans cuz I'm thirsty
forever thirsty
the next thing that's ruining my life is
my hair and my desire to have it be
different colors I'm pretty sure at some
point I'm not gonna have any hair so
right now it's worth it but it is angry
at me Harris had it the next thing
that's ruining my life and I tweeted
about this the other day is grocery
delivery or really any food delivery
service like robbed hub post mates
they're all ruining my life because
before you had all these things
delivered to you like maybe you could
get a pizza delivered to you maybe you
could get like Chinese food delivered to
you well now I don't even have to go to
the grocery store anymore because I just
have someone
give me my fucking celery and my chit
and then I eat it and I don't ever have
to leave it's like the best worst thing
ever invented I have to leave my house
to feed myself it shouldn't even be
possible but it is I literally see dog
faces more than I see people faces like
to the point where you think that your
dog face is a human face like tell me
that doesn't look like a human to you
because it looks like a human to me oh
we look alike the next thing that's
ruining my life is soup Jenna how is
super owning your life soup is ruining
my life because it's all I ever want to
eat at every meal ever I could eat soup
it's so bad I used to take my lunch
break at my old job and I would walk to
this place and I would go pick up soup
in the middle of summer and they would
go you know we literally only make soup
every day because you're the only one
that orders it you know would be like 95
degrees out every day Jenna what do you
want for lunch ah some fucking soup I'm
the only person that I know that wants
to eat soup and every fucking meal
people make fun of me so if you have a
suggestion of how I can wean myself off
of soup so that people stop making fun
of me I would be fantastic the next
thing that's ruining my life is fake tan
Jenna if fake tan is ruining your life
why don't you stop using fake tan
because when I get a fucking spray tan I
feel like fucking Rihanna it's ruining
my life because it destroys my clothes
and my sheets my bathroom is like a
lovely shade of tan cuz it gets
everywhere and with your aerosol and
although you try to wipe it down and the
next day it like got tanner and then you
realize that it's fucking everywhere and
on your carpet like in the bed like
where I sleep it's like really a tan and
also I feel like it limits me in the
choices that I make in my life
Jenna you want to go swimming ah I wish
I could but I can't because I just got a
spray tan and I don't want to ruin it so
I'll watch you swim from here yeah I'm
burning hot I'm sweating my tan off but
I don't want to submerge myself take all
the tan off you know just like a reverse
mustache in like the head stuff can come
off yeah my arm prints can be wait but
like my legs look good right no so I'm
gonna pass it gets on other people I
can't hug people wearing white I tell
them beforehand because if I do I will
turn your white clothes Brown another
thing that's ruining my life are my
Buffalo needs what our Buffalo needs
it's when you love buffalo sauce so much
that you need to eat it on a regular
basis or else you die another thing
that's ruining my life is the fact that
you have to clean makeup brushes oh I
think I'm getting like a light color on
there just kidding you're getting
I don't like when people say that they
clean their fucking makeup brushes all
the time no you don't riddle me a person
that's a non makeup artist that cleans
their makeup brushes every day but I
will show you a fucking liar another
thing that's ruining my life is the fact
that puppies exist and that I can't have
anymore
and hairless cats you know what else is
ruining my life banana peels well
they're so slippery hey I'm gonna die on
step on a crack break your mother's back
step on a banana peel you die you die
only you can prevent banana deaths
alright this video and you send those
are the things that are ruining my life
and I'm hoping by saying them out loud
that I will get better at having them
not ruin my life I mean tell me the
things that are ruining your life so
that I can feel better the way that I
just told you so then you feel less bad
and then I feel less bad and then
everyone feels less bad and then our
lives can be better we're here for each
other now I really just want to go play
some Elder Scrolls and drink some soda
