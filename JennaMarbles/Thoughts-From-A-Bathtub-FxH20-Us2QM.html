they get really great thinking done when
they're in the shower I do not because I
have too many things to do in there to
shave it's like actual work on the other
hand though when I take a bath I feel
like I have great thoughts so I wanted
to share with you some of the things
that I think about all I'm in the
bathtub
here is thoughts from a bathtub I mean
for starters who wears a full face of
makeup into a bathtub me it feels as
weird as it looks do you think you can
bring a bath bomb on a plane like what
you get arrested for that and if you did
do you think you could bring your bath
bomb to jail with you I think a bad time
to be a chameleon is when you're being
accused of doing blackface where is it
to although if someone that plays the
piano is a pianist why isn't someone
that plays the banjo Abby Janice I'd
like to have a profession that's sound
sexual but is it fun icebreaker do Fed
Ex guys sometimes leave a note without
knocking cuz they're in a rush to get
home to their package that's coming
where someone's gonna leave a note
without knocking some people are really
good at letting go of the past like we
used to burn witches and homosexuals but
neither of those groups have a problem
going to Burning Man pretty admirable
yeah but what if t-rex has had really
long arms I think we could solve a lot
of this country's economic problems by
just selling the Louisiana Purchase back
think about it
pretty good it I think we should adopt
human echolocation we're you scream at
things to see how far away from them you
are where you're also able to yell at
things when they're too close to you
when batteries die they don't go to
heaven because we haven't been burying
them we've been doing them a great
disservice I think one thing we can do
to help the racial unrest in this
country so just enable Helen Keller mode
where everyone's blindfolded and deaf
and has to talk to each other through
American Sign Language and touch each
other and help each other I think it
might make everyone love and appreciate
each other really quickly why do we have
names for all of our fingers but only
two of our toes big toe pinky toe what
about the other three in the middle I
think just one time instead of electing
a president we should try electing a
presidentís just a dentist
president I thought tea was too heavy so
one time I drink a tea light and I
burned my face I feel bad for boats that
are just boats and not love boats
who hurt you if black don't crack then
why do we crack black pepper
shouldn't we don't crack black pepper
Jesus is the only person that wants
other people to get presents on his
birthday
what a guy why do you think my dog wants
to be groomed how do you know he doesn't
want to be bright adore partnered how
dare you assume his sexuality why do we
curl our eyelashes but never our
eyebrows it seems like discrimination
we're the problem disciplining kids is
one of my favorite things to do excuse
me good practice for the next time when
I want to go discipline kids when a fuck
boy becomes a man does he get a fuck
Mitzvah and when he does become a man
what happens to them someone's just
gonna have to care long enough to find
out bestiality is wrong unless it's an
animal humping a person and then
everyone's like ha ha that animals
trying to get with vari so dumb like get
a job first uh we only have human rights
because all of our left's left us to go
to left world where all the scissors are
backwards why do we want to watch other
people have sex it's not like we want to
watch each other grocery shop or clean
their house or go to sleep oh wait yeah
we do
nightstands are really tired from never
getting to sit down I think coasters
just need a pep talk
you're just coasting through life get
out there and go fulfill your dreams you
can do it scaring people is fun because
they deserve it
succulence sound like they need the most
water though candles are the only thing
that smelled better when you burn them
ants are good at teamwork but they're
also good at team dying I don't
understand who got to decide which
animals we were selectively breeding I
don't think that dogs should have been
made smaller at all I think that they
should have been made bigger so that we
can ride them I think of a giant
Chihuahua that is the most terrifying
dog on the planet and who decided that
we weren't making sloth smaller I want a
small sloth I want a pocket sloth I
wouldn't like to have been the first
person to ever try garlic I think that'd
be pretty cool hey guys try this it's
good right you're welcome
a good rule for asking someone if
they're
pregnant is don't ever when I look into
your eyes I'm uncomfortable we have all
these laws protecting children and stuff
but like why is it just don't pierce
their ears until they can talk a thing
fish eat fish that's fucked up
why does Facebook still exist and how
can we stop it why do I even have
snapchat if I just skip through
everyone's story why can't your kneecaps
also bend backwards and why aren't we
funneling tons of money into this did
you brush your dog's teeth today me
either
sit with the guilt I think snorkeling
would be fun if you did it on your couch
with the TV on why did I even make this
video I don't know so yeah those are
some of my thoughts from the bathtub as
you can tell I'm really great at getting
thoughts on in here make sure you
subscribe to my channel I put interviews
and Wednesday / Thursday and I hope that
you liked my thoughts and that maybe if
you're having trouble thinking of things
just get in a bathtub and fill it up
with bubbles and sweat it's really hot
in here
and I sweat off my makeup which I
shouldn't have put on in the first place
but I couldn't think of that because it
wasn't in the bathtub while I put it on
Friday gotta go bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
