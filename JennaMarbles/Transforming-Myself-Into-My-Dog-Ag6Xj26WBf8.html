mine the internet has done it the
Internet has created a combination of my
two favorite things in the world it's
when people transform themselves into
their dogs the first time I saw this was
dope two one one one who actually did
all those eyes and stuff she invented
that trend the trippy double vision
makeup she recently transformed herself
into her dog she like wore a prosthetic
and like the whole puffy like dog outfit
and stuff but then I saw an Instagram a
makeup artist named Alexis stone who
does like celebrities like he makes
himself into anybody and everybody and
he turned himself into my dog Kermit if
I was like all right if I wasn't sold
when I watched someone else transform
themselves into a dog now I'm sold
I need to become Carmen I'm gonna really
struggle with this because I'm not I
don't know how to like paint I've tried
twice in the past to do like actual
artwork on my face and failed miserably
it saw my forte that's like the whole
comment section of this video
you're bad lucky that I have like an
artist template of like what to follow
so I'm really gonna be following his
video here
first things first let me get my hair on
my face real professional like oh so for
this video I really went all out when we
went to the art people store you know
for people like needs or artists or an
artist
I got like face paint but they only have
black and white so we got other ones to
turn into gray step one I'm gonna take
off my choker and yes you guessed it
when I take it off my whole head will
fall off so I realized when I watched
back his video that the first thing that
he like kind of does it's all in fast
motion it's not a tutorial but he does
glue his eyebrows down so we ready I
know how to do that I did this before
just a little bit everywhere so they're
like the first second of the video
there's so much happening all the way
under the
and down here and what something
flashback so what we did this before I
don't have enough lift for this fuck
would you laugh at that something under
here something under here something
going like this something going like
this some stuff going on around here

mix the gray ice to make a perfect
salmon gray how's this oh shit
it feels so nice he has this like an
outline around his eye that he did he
does like a lot of shit shows yeah no I
think that's where he like stops why is
it drying like sort of blue Kermit's
like lighter than this
okay so my whole fucking I sick got it
all right what what already lactose fine
as it bizarre it's natural and normal
you ready for the eyes no no no we start
going down onto the neck which he's
already drawn lines on I'm gonna need
like a whole last shower after this
Marcin gray very concerned about this
color there's so much darker than Kermie
I don't know what's going on I did a
little like here in here but then he
does a lot of it was like shadow after
oh my god sorry Ms Julian please the
help
oh yeah yeah I had to cough and I can't
move my lips oh my god what if I get
thirsty just cleaning my white wines how
do I fucking do that
it's actually really the whites so hard
was even like see brush strokes so he
powders like the top of the face
Oh Beach oh I feel terrible now felt so
good when it was wet

to look like him yes but this is don't
extra when people ask you what your
girlfriend does for a living what do you
tell them late happening up here I'm an
artist I'm a shady Beach you were going
that bet ready oh no am i ruining it Oh
some of it fell on my face I know it's
making it look missed uh oh sick he does
it like under here like right here we're
in the double chin you know I just like
honestly say that after
his video leaked multiple times positive
you were to be worse at the thought you
believed in me this is very well sweetie
Oh beat you Amir who sort of supports
know you so good honestly at this point
I don't I just don't even know don't let
a dog what I'm asking honestly for a
friend

me from here don't do that don't
threaten me don't you threaten me
oops that's too thick I've already
fucked up you can do it you know what
this whole like not having a grey and
then mixing it myself everytime is
really not turning out well for me
if the fix in my face for quite some
time I'm finally ready to try the
whiskers a kid like that why are you
looking at me like that
this is normal stuff right then he does
a couple of bro oh my god there's so
many things in front of me all right now
I need my wig and my Sam it's alright

beautiful matching oh my god wait can
you zoom in I feel like I can see that
but I'm freaking out right now
[Laughter]
what am i God oh but yeah I'm like a
little darker than he is for sure I know
I don't usually post thumbnails where
you can see the end result but like is
this a thumbnail it's so trippy
unfortunately Kermit doesn't really have
front teeth anymore so we're not really
gonna match you know how'd I do
don't ever talk to me and my son again
I've reached my final form scratcher
passed hey do you know Oh lick it off he
doesn't even care that I just spent all
these hours doing this to myself do you
care that I did all this work it took a
long time stop trying to get away from
me act like you like me for the end of
this video please comment
put your weight back on like what's that
mean like I wonder what jenna Marbles is
up to it was like incredibly difficult
but like if you spend enough time you
can do it like anyone can do it it takes
a specific set of skills to look at a
picture and then do it on yourself like
I could only do it because I watched
someone do a video should I close my
eyes more well this was this so make
sure you subscribe to my channel I put
out new videos every Wednesday /
Thursday I guess I'll see you next time
but
one chicken for wearing wig and good
play and good play when you're trying to
get a boy to like you at school so you
get into his interests I guess I'll take
a lonely adults hour now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
