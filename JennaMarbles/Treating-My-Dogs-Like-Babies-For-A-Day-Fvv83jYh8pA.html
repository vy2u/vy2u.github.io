pregnant okay if I was I would let you
know now that we have that out of the
way one of Julian's least favorite
things about me is that I baby the dogs
I'll show you baby the dogs I thought it
would be fun like yeah if I was Shane
Dawson I had access to 1-800 ranked a
baby for a day yeah maybe we could hang
out with the baby for a little that'd be
great that'd be super fun I don't have
that I don't know how he just finds
babies to rent for the day but what we
can do is go to babies r us get some
stuff for the dogs and turn them into V
for no reason I really I just want to
get like baby clothes put some diapers
on him I want a highchair I saw a video
of dogs that had this disorder where
they have to eat in a highchair and now
I'm obsessed with the idea of putting
one of my dogs in a highchair I'm
feeding them some baby food we gonna
have to assemble a highchair
that's super annoying I don't want to do
that what does that mean I have to do it
yeah this video doesn't need takes it I
just want it I just want to see Carmen
did on a chair don't you yeah he wants
his own charity eating yes he does I
think marbles will probably sit this
video out let's go to uh
the business we've got here just in time
let's do closed laughs cuz I feel like
we did spend a long time oh my god my
breasts oh you're my best friend in the
mouth okay yeah this is a great
invention when being a baby hits okay
one in a boy one you want to pick one
out for weeks
yeah this one it's you know this is
perfect why don't we get a bottle can
they drink nut milk we can just pick
chicken stock okay that's disgusting
they would like it you know yeah we'll
figure it out let's go all I'm saying is
that it's worth a shot
one of these yeah as long as I can put
meat on my back oh he looks comfortable
oh what is your baby
it's a marble playpen we can put in a
marble doesn't play it doesn't know how
to does play he looks you and he snaps
at me that's his whole life mumble plate
pan parts oh no not marvels like that
baby and I'm a arenas how do we get one
for vici this is her baby what do you
think we're doing stop housing the
swings like that boat ride honor honor
you just walked by the high chairs I
don't I'm doing a child in here business
bullet find that cheap one we're gonna
fuckin assemble it how's it feel to be
alone my children are nine and seven why

going out of business specifically that
kid I got diapers chicken-flavored baby

onesies that snap on the bottom she's
too big no she is this
I mean girth was she's very girthy about
this for me it's got sleeves he loves
these
away how's it going this thing is way
more confusing than it looks
you've been struggling banging over here
an awful lot can't with all this stuff
and you haven't figured out what it is
yet
you're never allowed to say that I'm
babying the dogs after this because this
is truly babying the dogs so I say we
put them in their clothes first and then
basically we're just gonna feed them in
a highchair yes right Carmy I'm so sorry
it's gonna be mildly inconvenient for
you but it's not everything's gonna be
okay shall I come over there and put
this day pee on you lay one set I got it
I don't know if this is gonna fit him we
should have gotten bigger diapers here
you go bud how's that it doesn't really
cover your weenus but how do you feel I
think this is the day when he's finally
had it with my shit yes you can poopie
but you can't go number one it's just
gonna squirt up at your chest
we gotta get your office no really like
shirts too much what are we doing you're
just having a day all right just like
any other day I know that's a very long
sleeve because it's very human baby
that's a very good book the perfect fit
just for cerements
it's Lance Lance okay what do you think
maybe is baby feeling he actually likes
it like you know how he usually freaks
out that's like talking about the diaper
just like made of it kind of happen oh
yes I kind of like it
Cubby's might bottom you don't feel like
so insecure of what you enos huh do you
maybe you want something to eat
you've made my breastfeeding pillow you
like that
yeah this thing is actually so helpful
and you can it's like a little show for
me why are we start with a lot though
I just asked Google if dogs can have
almond milk and it said in moderation
it's okay yeah but okay like is it just
me or is he like he's actually kind of
like enjoying this a little bit you it's
a milk oh we got a lick what do you
think about a peanut butter bottle you
like that occur me all right should we
save some for peachy then it's gonna
have to oh I dripped it into his nose oh
I'm sorry did you just snort it that's
nasty
what do you think you want some food
Winnie we usually put clothes on him he
gets really pissed off but he's like
completely relaxed like I'm telling you
I think it has something to do with like
the covering of his like but in genitals
has like made him very relaxed take a
bud you gotta get your little legs in
there okay one hey you go hey go okay
why does he like this he's like actually
enjoying himself
look at this that is disgusting do you
want this is actually like a really nice
way to feed your dog because we have
three and if one of them doesn't finish
early enough they'll fight so we can
feed one of them at the table is that
good the nice big bite now you get the
bottom peach is so jealous right now
peach you'll have a turn but you need to
wear the outfit and sit in the chair
