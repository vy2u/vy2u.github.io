no easy way to transition from we bought
a house back to like shape in my face
and covering it really sounds like it
feels wrong so I think the best thing
for me to do is act on that and just do
what it is and moving has been a lot
it's been non-stop like all day every
day and then at night we'll take a break
and stream or play video games or
whatever but we still have so much stuff
to do I mean for the most part we're
great where we live in our furniture is
here where we're doing pretty good I
mean not everything is unpacked like I
still don't have a desk like there's a
lot of stuff we could get but like we're
gonna be fine for a while without it
maybe some curtains upstairs because
everybody can see is just buzzed naked
up there like I think we should do that
relatively soon you know this type of
video probably isn't for everybody but I
certainly like watching this content on
YouTube so I thought instead of trying
to make something today that would be
the regularly scheduled programming in a
place that doesn't quite feel right I
just take you along with us today while
we're doing things that we would be
doing anyways for example we ordered a
new table because I don't know if you
can tell but I done ruined this one I
mean not only did I ruin it it's just
not quite right for this space so I'm
sure like all the furniture that we put
out on the street people have taken so I
feel like someone will probably still
take this cuz it's still a beautiful
table maybe it just needs a tablecloth
but we got a new table that's a
rectangle we can fit some more chairs
that we didn't get more chairs though so
maybe we're gonna need to get more
chairs on your table you think okay you
know this is your house - nice loft
table with four weird chairs at it I
want gaming chairs for the dining room
what we're not gonna do there's already
been a very heated debate about what you
did in the office with that pin racket
you think it's like a tilted rack like
Julian hung it up yeah yeah it's it's
just a tilted rack you did hang it
straight but you were like look my pin
racks like honestly if you're standing
somewhere else in the room it looks fine
so you said it a complete angle to where
almost you can't even see the yeah I
mean aha I've got weak arms I'm kidding
it's like this strong it's part of my
pod if you think enormous um yeah I got
weak arms you gotta build it then I feel
like there's just a few things that will
probably help a lot like the new
portrait no no nude portraits Julian I'm
not really nude in front of myself okay
I don't have okay I have one of me I
think that's entire code actually I that
sounds great I think if we got like a
mirror here that would help a lot my
vanity upstairs I would love to have
like a stool for one of the seven deadly
sins
[Laughter]
vanity gluttony greed stools yeah we're
getting you a vanity stool yeah and we
can just get some stuff to make it feel
homey it's not to make me feel lonely
yeah way the stool take away the table
and what you have okay I feel like
fucking a huge table you know that right
yeah I know that that's why you're gonna
need my help
even though
this is what it's like building
something with him he refuses to read
the directions there are no directions
most things they'll come with directions
it's a suggestion pamphlet that's it
yeah so we got this table on wafer which
I feel like can be hit or miss when you
order stuff online
they sometimes it comes in you know it's
not what you thought it was gonna look
like so I guess we'll see but it was
unclear
you know show us the legs
oh that like Julian's led that one is
the grand
Julius Blair Oh was that you wanted the
suggestion pamphlet yeah I just no no
I've had this for many many moons no not
having many moons
the dogs have been doing pretty well
only marble got a little stretched out
he got a little constipated but he's all
right now
seeing much better you know that it's a
stressful week when wearables gets
constipated right Julian
absolutely that boy speaks volumes with
his bowel movements Wayfair you got
different I need what so when we get new
chairs I want to get ones with like
cushions because the dogs really like to
jump up and sit with us even though some
people think that that's bad manners I
think that is tonight stuff you guys sit
at the table with us yes you're welcome
in this house to sit at the table with
us just don't get on the table and
trying to eat my food that's when it
goes
what do you think I think it's so steak
you know I really like the table these
chairs softly don't look that great but
we can figure that on the future but for
the time being we can get like just two
in chairs so they look nice it's crazy
that it built it from scratch yeah just
from a piece of wood Wow you're like so
Andy Pryor this is why we need chairs
with cushions though because they like
they really like to sit with us so we're
on our way to go to a couple of
furniture stores to maybe look at some
chairs and some other stuff I'm not good
at this stuff like really truly like I
don't I can't my brain doesn't work in
the way of like oh I wonder what would
look good here like I really don't know
because this is coming from the person
that had paper curtains for the longest
time because they functional okay
they're inexpensive and when we are
renting a place it made a lot of sense
right now we don't have that excuse
though and we have to make something
nice but I like I don't I really don't
know how to do this I'm not good at it
welcome to my tutorial this is a
signature subscribe what do you think
it's too Brown I don't know how to do
any of this my brain doesn't work like I
know this is not my realm I don't I
don't really like any of these
nor do I really like any of the chairs I
think it's safe to say we struck out
here look at all these glasses though
that's what we came here for so we just
changed our whole entire goal today and
only get the kitchenware and just regard
everything else actually do they have
Forks cuz we never have any port oh you
want to get a whole new set of forks
just just like ten Forks of you 11 on an
odd number by the port you don't have to
buy the whole set is that to like big of
a fork cuz I feel like that's a big size
or someone's mouth maybe this is your
life but it's certainly mine I don't
know where all my porks about like for
Christmas one year Julian literally just
bought me a pack Forks because I don't
know where they've gone they're gone
stick a fork in me cuz I'm done
where's this go there no that dude I
just don't like how thin this part don't
I'm sorry the ones that I handed you
don't like these better
that's literally bigger I prefer this
one oh yeah I like it how about it no
sorry
all right we got six weeks and then the
one one people pull this book yes so
golden spoon
let me have it I wanted it's like shaped
for a baby I'm gonna eat out of it every
day
this is $5 lick you always spend $5.00
on them pasta by hand
welcome you know just put it in a bomb
shelter a bath bomb shelter
mix and match all right let's get
started
she left dreidel dreidel stop pulling me
around the party when Flora's day when
laughter is life
one time stands out something yeah I
think successful trusts don't work
somewhere else okay like that idea
you get one listen okay I feel like it's
gonna take us a very long time to make
our house like nice at all
at this rate but it's all about the baby
steps in fact I think we took steps
backwards today because we like we've
strayed further from what we know is a
gigantic waste of time like look at the
bright side what's the bright side oh
you're talking
we got your stupid baby we got something
other than my spoon are you happy yeah I
just feel like I'm so bad at this that
we will never be Rosanna pansino you
won't but I will
what's this back here
peach better not rubber little stinky
but on it really gets super discouraging
to find stuff that you like for your
house I don't how do people have like
the will to do this no that's uh I don't
know like I look at our most of our
house and I see how like empty spots
aren't I'm like Oh be nice if this was
like but I don't know what to put that
but yeah I don't even know where to
start like this this to me is so foreign
it's a skill that I just do not have I'm
never gonna be Rosetta piece you know
this sucks
things we've learned today Christian
rock bumps shopping for things in the
world and not on the internet is this
gigantic waste of time right
let's go to one more place and see what
we can find and then go home yeah I
programmed our Google home last now
while you weren't home to only play
Christian rock so actually I'm dumb or
no it just makes me feel like we're in
whatever place GG gorgeous is currently
living in
possessive like Gaston like super drunk
and you like barely drinking
oh my god this is how they rest this is
like the only thing that we got today
honestly leaving the house is a waste of
time Wow okay you know I know this isn't
very exciting but this has made it all
worth it to me oh you like that
yeah rub that blood on it rub your butt
on it oh isn't that nice we're out it's
going else you can sit with me
yeah just for ask why yes what are you
doing I organized all my makeup this
says to all my excuse me my pellets and
lashes sooner oh and I can join make up
stay down for like the first time in
like years it's tucked away in Wow okay
I wish I could just ordered it online
and didn't send fucking getting it but
one step at a time right up I'm gonna
play yourself Norway
are you walking like that holder it's so
fast that's literally all this are you
not gonna be sick that's essences while
I was trying to think of an excuse of
why I shouldn't take one off one what I
think the usefulness of those stores
that we went to today are characterized
precisely by the amount of people
shopping in them which was zero for
every star we were less than four it is
so frustrating to go to a furniture
store with something in mind and like
you just can't find it and if if you can
they're like oh we can order it for you
like I can order it why did I come here
what have I done why did I do this this
is something that can wait maybe we can
order two more chairs online and not do
this try and go find stuff nonsense
definitely like a mirror like the only
mirrors that we saw were like so
expensive
when you can buy the same size one like
me it's always good quality or something
like hundreds of dollars less like what
the hell I guess we'll do that and I'll
keep you updated I know this wasn't a
very exciting video but our life isn't
terribly exciting right now live and
create while we're still moving yeah it
definitely felt a little too weird for
me to just be like all right back to
what I was doing but now that we have a
new table for this space I will say this
alone is not open plus like if I we get
those like light colored chairs how am I
gonna die people with hair
people everybody's there
nobody's heresy even though today was a
gigantic waste of time and unsuccessful
I hope you still found some enjoyment in
something because Julian getting a
golden spoon is really what life is
about honestly is that in your pocket he
hate it it doesn't match everything else
stop it are you gonna name your spoon
I'm sorry that this wasn't so exciting
but I hope you had fun if you liked this
kind of thing watching us um get
incredibly frustrated today but we will
order some stuff and I'll keep you
updated or Julian at least in your vlogs
for sure I'm not that thing is fucking
but it's good it is not ok it's really
ok so but I'm glad that we at least have
a table so now I feel like I have a
workspace I can't bring my throwing
machine down here I can do hot grub hot
glue crafts on it
nothing has changed ok like we still
don't know how to furnish our house fuck
off make sure you subscribe to all be
back at hopefully with regular content
next week I'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
