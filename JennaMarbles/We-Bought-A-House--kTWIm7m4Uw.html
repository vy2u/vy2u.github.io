title I know a lot of you are going to
fast forward to see our new house that's
why live your life but for those of you
that maybe know us a little better than
following me or Julian for a while now a
lot of you have correctly guessed what
we have been alluding to that we did in
fact buy a house I do just want to say a
couple things about this for those of
you that know us like this is something
that I have been saving for like since
any of you have known me and like I do
have a little bit of like nice things
guilt like I want to tell you how much
like I have to say it for so long to
have my house and you know don't like
have nice clothes or I'd say the biggest
thing we spend our money on is like food
we had a lot of help getting to this way
or we could save our money to buy a
really beautiful home for us to live in
for the foreseeable future like I don't
really even see this as a starter home
and that was kind of my goal was to find
a place of where we could live and grow
in for
years ago and you know it did take a
while to get to that point but we did it
in a way that was responsible
it's just
like to me the house is a gigantic
responsibility and I'm like really
excited to take that on but like it's
not lost on me what owning a home means
and I feel like when people do like I
bought a house it's all like look at my
house isn't it beautiful but to me I'm
terrified the whole time I'm terrified
of everything for those of you who
follow us closely you know that you know
this has been a goal of ours for some
time now and for a long time now and
even more reason I'm not illegal it is
super exciting and it's a big deal for
us that were now homeowners together and
the process was a lot and it will
continue to be a lot there's a lot of
things that come along with owning a
home but I also hope you know that we
wanted to tell you after everything we
had closed down the house like there's
reasons why we didn't tell he was not
like we were trying to keep a secret
from here anything but when we show you
the new house you know I'm not going to
show you things like that the outside of
the front and again I hope you know it's
because you know we've had security
issues in the past and it's not because
we don't want to show you it's just like
we just we're not going to show you some
stuff you know what I mean I hope you're
ok with that it's a culmination of many
years of planning and hard work and
saving and it takes a lot to buy a home
you know responsibility and make sure we
budget our money for the future so we
can continue to live there
it's completely terrifying like I hope
you know when you see all the nice
things at our house that to me I don't
see that I just see like a terrifying
responsibility I'm very scared this
represents a lot for our future and to
have this ability to continue to work
independently like on the podcast and
our twitch stream and our radio show we
can continue to have an area at home
where we can work which is a choice you
know a lot of people sign with companies
that do all of these things for them we
have chosen to be as independent as
possible which presents a lot of
challenges a lot of time and effort
energy work all the things and pressure
and pressure yet to you know do all that
stuff and we could rent a studio space
but instead we decided that we really
like working at home so we've actually
converted a lot of our house there's a
good portion of the new house that
really isn't a home just kind of like a
work area but that's like when you guys
know how to spend our time yeah I also
hope you know that this isn't I'm not
trying to contribute to the online
culture of the look at my life and look
at my nice things like this this is a
really big deal for us but you know
we're doing it in a responsible way I
think at this point us and you showing
the house and what you know what you're
gonna show and me showing what I'm gonna
show and telling you guys that we bought
a house together isn't so much as to do
anything besides keep you updated and be
honest with you because that's what this
is but I agree it is scary you know
getting a house and moving into it and
showing the internet because you like
we're not a part of that culture that
shows off all the nice that people
buy it's like that's not what these
things I've been saving my money for
years to buy a home so that's it work
that's the secret we're the team we're
slowly telling you because we're being
honest with you and we don't want to
leave you guys in the dark I've saved
for a long time have been responsible
and this house is a giant responsibility
don't come over and make a mess
don't don't type your feet don't wipe
your feet before you come in at it's our
future though
you know this is the home that we're
gonna live in for a long time I hope so
again I got my tools ready I'm a
handyman and a homeowner now I can fix
things but you can fix some things not
all things you're supposed to you're
supposed to root your husband on you're
not married I'm the husband who who goes
around the house with these tools we're
not married but we are legally bound by
a deed
woody also this week in particular like
the movers are coming on Friday to move
our furniture
we've moved you know I'd say the
majority of our stuff over there already
just using my car and a million trips
but I can't show you like a house tour
with our furniture in it because it's
not currently in it but I have gotten to
the point where I can't film here or
there okay there's like both half houses
at this point yeah well this one there's
nothing in it basically but our bed and
couch yeah but our new house you know
there's a we have a person in one of the
bedrooms the previous owner had turned
it into a whole closet room and that
room has a extra walk-in closet in it so
it's a double closet room so he's in
there taking out the closets in that
room and then there's also cleaners all
right now just so like you know cleaning
the bathrooms and because there was
someone who owned it before us but I
also wanted to show you because in case
we stream this weekend you're gonna
notice that we're not in the same room
at all I think we're just gonna just
randomly scream out of a new room for
those of you that know me and have
followed me for a really long time like
you know that this is like all I've been
saving for like to me this represents my
future and this is the one thing that
I've been working really really really
really really hard for so I am
incredibly proud like I don't want to
think about it too much I will cry but
like I'm I'm so proud and I I hope you
guys see that too and you don't just see
a nice house you see what it means so as
how large of a responsibility is how
terrifying it is and what it means to us
and that this is our you know our safe
place and our workspace and our studio
and like our dogs home maybe someday we
can adopt or racing
oh my god my next three let's show them
our current full house no it's not it's
empty and dirty and dusty and your hair
is uneven and you're not that cute most
of our stuff is will got we've left one
chair here so we can take turns eating
but like you know it's like it's kind of
nostalgic that's a podcast table only
the base fit in my car
not that but uh you know it's sad but
it's good
we had prom in here we did and we did my
first stand-up comedy show there oh
we've already moved the rug and stuff
like this is wild we're obviously gonna
have somebody help us you know fix the
walls and stuff they don't leave it like
that well I mean the spaces are really
great for us but like and we did so much
in here like this is a challenge to were
currently all the doors open like in
towards the room so it makes it like
extra hard look at this is so sad you
guys is living room number rhpc y'all
squeezed on that they all fit in there
every single one of them alright so in a
minute we'll take you over to the new
house rums there oh you are oh it's
pranker okay let's pretend the last
vampire that's not funny anymore
No
things
most people you're cleaning I'm sorry I
don't know Lisa this is why we can't
film there or here it is going to be our
office because this is obviously like a
formal living room but I don't know
about you battles with any form of
living
in casual living so this is a much
better office space for us so the dogs
can have a fireplace
oh you graduated Congrats I don't know
about you but I only bought a house and
then think about everything for my dogs
or I'm a true Lenny and here we will
keep a formal dining room you know for
Christmas or Thanksgiving
that's above it probably one of the
nicest things all buying a house is like
it has a built in or you have the
ability to make a built-in like this is
a the pushiest thing I've done ever seen
in my whole life it is the closet for
you worry what have we been using it as
well if the dogs are like out and
someone comes in you need them to like
be gone for a second we just we put them
in there real quick not for very long
for a second you know could've been fair
cuz we just like um family like me in
here James kitchen y'all tonight
and this right here this is the only
thing that was on my leg lips they're
like what are you looking for in a house
and I was like a pantry I just want a
pantry this is what you saved me money
for it's a banyan tree so we have like
one cabinet and a lazy susan right now
it's the best food in it
but we'll finally have a place to put
like vegans we have lots of like nuts
and like spring Yola and stuff that
isn't jars that just like needs a spot
so this is going to be the dog feeding
area we learned quickly last night the
marbles refuses to eat off the table
plate because it's too scary so we have
to give them a little feedings
this is the only room that's like
finished this is our our feeding setup
because like I said in the old house
this Julian didn't have a gaming desk we
just had the podcast table and we would
podcast from there and then move the
monitors and then we would game and
there at night and mine would be like
real close off to the side so it was
just like it was a lot in a small space
so now we have like a proper sort of
gaming setup so we can come in and
stream and have a good time this is the
first room we finished
prioritizing real good priorities so
this is my favorite place ever because
they have backyard and
there's not much to say like I'm not
here I just want to cry so it's like
that's being in my home and everything's
all fenced in the dogs can't get out
it's not like right up against the
street where dogs walk by they can't
just sit there and park it I'm all the
time then they actually haven't used the
pool yet because we need someone to come
and show us what is it because I am that
person that if I flip the switch I will
break the whole guy comes to show how to
use the pool gets in his swim trunks
jumps in kisses how you use it
over there is where we're going to have
our gym equipment and the podcaster
which is on a set that really
so second when we got first we wait
but this is the master
right now we're in my closet
like if I was a fancy person like what I
saw this was like this is so fancy but
like look what I've put in this
beautiful cabinet you know like a fancy
lady of sophistication that had like
beautiful stuff in there no there's a
stuffed animal backpack in a hat that
says sexy from Pigeon Forge Tennessee
along with tiny small stuffed animals
like oh that sure gets his own entire
rack that's okay this is the casual side
of the closet and then this is the
dressy side of the project
hmm look at all of my jewelry well you
got a jewelry thing yeah but like three
things as you can tell I'm the lady of
the case we had already put an offer on
the house they it accepted the offer so
like you hadn't closed yet for like we
were here doing stuff and there's these
iPads like we still have to figure out
how to do all this like a lot of it
needs to get set up like we can't do it
I was like gee I wonder if there's any
pictures on here so I went to the photos
and see anything so I was like I should
take a picture might the boy we had a
close yeah like it's not officially our
house but I was like yes elope was April
9th
forever
those are all my Peas
so this once when the house was staged
some really nice furniture in here was
staged but this was the only thing that
I was like we have to have that like
it's part of the bathroom can't can not
have it so great what's creamier well
the times when you're naked you're like
oh my god I don't want to see myself no
you just have to know I'll show you more
in the features we get sad but I'll show
