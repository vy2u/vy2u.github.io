kid nice to get a hamster it was like
the best day in the whole world and I'm
having it right now Lillian has never
had a hamster and don't worry we are
going to keep him away from the dogs ad
is our baby kind of fully prepared for
his two-year life spin it's going to be
hard but it's okay we're going to give
him all the love he deserves and then
right yeah this was definitely not for

a new baby accusing him he isn't kidding

nice to him okay he's not food he's a
friend come all righty guys a little
salt like in his wheel and his igloo I'm
gonna put some of her his Corrigan Bible
variety pack we're going to give them a
little bit to acclimate then I think
we're going to have them go in his wheel
and then we also got a little outdoor
area so he can hang out in the grass oh
my god there's a salt lake just for you
but look at this little hand stop it
I love them Adam so happy you like your
wheel and what a nice way to pass the
time for your two year lifespan
huh
yeah look now we just hang out look at
him traitor what's up next today I'm
going to let him hang out eat some
dinner movie in his cage and then I
think I'm going to try putting him in
the ball and see if you like we told a
girl in the store they were like Odeon
Amos and we were like oh we already
named them his name is ad like Oh Edie -
like no ad we should have named him
promo code I know absolutely can changes
no it means that his full name is Edward
no it isn't AdWords scissorhands bad
word
come here Edward come ah he doesn't know
his name dog he never will there you go
you did it Julian I'm proud of you yeah
no he's never gonna get so bad huh he's
easy to hold the whole thing is just
getting over the eye contact for me
calls them nice and low to their own you
know what I'm gonna jump it's amazing to
me that like you don't know how to
handle it you get you a boyfriend who's
great with animals yeah really cute it's
been a lot for him so I think bring a
lot of eat some dinner soon and then
we'll try a ball later and see if he
likes it sometimes they don't like it
sometimes they do so we'll see I like
you an awful lot I'm just really glad
that I got a little hamster because I
was thinking about my dream life and I
really just want to be surrounded by all
the animals so that's my dream life why
aren't I doing it so I did I just went
out and got a little Easter he seems
like he could use love in a good home
you know so what so I'm going to give
you bud we're actually going to let this
little one say hello
she hasn't yet mumble so big compared to
little guy Oh what the what Easter is
that where is that foot
we moved adds permanent locations in
here because although the dogs are very
sweet and I trust them to not be shifty
I only have trust them to not be shifty
so we don't want them being able to like
visit him while we're not looking no
guys he's having a little bit of quiet
time right now he had a big day okay
just a nice little igloo having a little
nap and then we can try having him go on
the ball okay but you guys gotta let him
relax all right you know he has to relax
right now he's at a big day we have a
global ously bad we'll see you a little
while somebody had a lid on that you
were doing there hmm a little tiny
friend
oh my dream I'm wearing my doing mine oh
my lad never skip you pick you're on you
should make more ads like this okay then
this is it takes a lot Congrats on the
first a dive around your channel if you
can tell me what this is the f-word
resource because it's not an ad we got
stuff for ad like his house and
everything but the majority of supplies
that we bought at the pet store was
docks of land so don't worry they're
going to get plenty of love and
attention
oh I think I disagree I think he does
that see he looks at me
oh he's cute always doing oh my God he's
so cute and you're gonna have such a
nice light a quick update on little
adhere so I'm so glad that Julian posted
his vlog because we start seeing
comments of people being like a bigger
cage and you need a bigger wheel or like
feed them less food it's all very
helpful because we didn't know what ad
was going to be he could have been a
reptile or a bird so we just said the
best and nobody at that store helped us
pick out the right cage for him we just
did the best that we could so we're
still going to get him better stuff but
I came in here because I put like some
toilet paper in there for his like
bedding or whatever and I was just
standing on top of his cage and I was
like dad what are you doing
I don't remember owning a hamster being
this complicated this was all very
complicated and I feel terrible because
he's like so little he must have just
been able to squeeze through here and
this is it's like pretty fine it's like
a standard hamster cage size but he
still managed to get out so I can't
leave him in here overnight that's
terrifying so I think thanks to the
internet I have like a storage bin that
I can use at least for overnight until I
get him a bigger cage because I can't
have him just running around in the
house I had oh my god but he's enjoying
his bowl right now she's so sweet no I
don't want to push him I just want to
know what he's doing and where he's
going so we're cleaning this out right
now so that we can put his bedding in
here and it will keep them in here
overnight what I'm just imagining
standing I was oh I couldn't believe it
I could not believe it I feel so bad
that I've done so wrong buy him out
we're going to make it right but we're
going to get to a nice big cage with all
kinds of stuff no one told me while he's
really enjoying himself there you go
okay he spent a long first day with that
but I would trade it for the world I
love him very much
Julian did his best to cut a bunch of
ventilation holes in the talk we debated
whether or not to put the top on there
really maybe you just climb out I don't
know we're doing the best we can get in
the current circumstances it doesn't
look like he could climb or jump out of
here even with the top off and my solid
plan C is to
I really have him just live in the
bathtub I promise this isn't your home
forever
okay this probably last time I'll ever
upload video like this I hope you
enjoyed it for any reason you know we
got a hamster is really exciting we're
just figuring it out because we're new
hamster parents that's all be patient
with us but make sure you subscribe to
my channel I'll put interviews every
Wednesday / Thursday and I'll probably
keep you updated on probably snapchat or
something of add and how we go with him
that's Jennifer marbles on snapchat so
wish me luck and I promise that I will
get at a much better living situation I
hope you like to meeting our new family
member and Julianne high key low key I
think is in love with hamsters that's
not the cutest thing I've ever seen in
my life
he's like peaches dude your answer it's
true and now we're going out a long long
life journey together as soon as we get
add a better place to live so I'll see
you guys next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
