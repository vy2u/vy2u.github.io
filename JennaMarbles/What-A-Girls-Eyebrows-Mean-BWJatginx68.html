hooker hair I am now actually AM Silver
Fox
so I've done so many of these in the
past then what you make it means what
your nails mean what your hair means
would you brought me and shoes like
fucking you name it act on it and
everyone has been asking me for what
your eyebrows mean because they say an
awful lot about you whether or not you
admit it to yourself
so since I'm a fucking genius I'm gonna
make it exist for you my friends because
last week I got really weird and thank
you for letting me get that diarrhea out
of my brain
eyebrows have become some really prime
real estate on your face think of them
as like the Beverly Hills of your face
okay they're important features other
important features include your eyes
they're like the New York City in your
face
they're always light and bright and
exciting need a lot of focus your lips
are the Las Vegas of your face they're
sexy and sexual your cheeks aren't like
Chicago coz they're pretty cool and your
chin nose and forehead are like the
Idaho of your face because no one gives
a fuck about them that being said the
shape of your eyebrows can completely
change the rest of your face and it is
simple geometry they shouldn't be that
easy to fuck up take a pencil and put it
on your nose they should start here and
here and on your iris they should arch
there within those guidelines you can
jazz them up all kinds of different ways
and it says a lot about you as a person
so I'm gonna go through those things
right now
eyebrows with nothing in them mean I
woke up like this now can you please
strain around because my eyebrows are
naked and need to get dressed don't look
no closure edge natural looking eyebrows
mean I'm such a natural beauty like I
just like to enhance my features and let
all of my natural beauty shine through I
see my Instagram looks like all selfies
for a bit straight across eyebrows mean
I have no emotions I also hate my dad
yes you can copy my math
I really need handwriting sad eyebrows
me cuz guys I'm drunk two different
eyebrows me guys have drunk or it means
I'm just a regular person and eyebrows
are really kind of difficult to get the
same eyebrows your sisters not twins
eyebrows that are too close together
mean uh uh uh perfect
it also looks great if you cross your
eyes eyebrows get lonely too they need
friends this just means that my eyebrows
are lonely and they need each other
eyebrows that are too far apart mean I
don't worry where are you who am i what
are we doing and I drink so much
caffeine I forgot I was doing half way
through uh you know what else is this
far apart by nipples square eyebrows me
and I like to do this with a stencil
because I love staying within the lines
clean lines are my favorite just like
the lines when you're drunk square and
overdrawn means
guitar you better feed them before they
fly away oh my god they think oh they're
leaving oh my god you gotta feed them
feed them ok good say where you are
peaked eyebrows mean I'm a witch and I'm
cooking a love spell for you to keep it
up do up coordinates I peaked in high
school or it means I like to take my
sexual frustration out on my eyebrows
eyebrows that are too thin mean I put my
birthday on eHarmony but not my picture
anything about me really cuz I just
can't commit to that I also can only eat
food that's gluten-free nut-free
dairy-free lactose free grass fed grass
free non GMO non h2o and only cooked in
a facility where there's no people you
know my field office leaves eyebrows
that are too high up mean I'm so
surprised and excited about everything
or it means I'm on drugs or it means
look how much space I put between my
eyes and my eyebrows are so much room
for activities do like guacamole vessel
love lucy' eyebrows that are too low
means where your eyebrows even supposed
to look like again
CAIR do you care I don't care I eat a
lot of sausage weird sperm shaped

just figured out how to tweeze my
eyebrows I did this all by myself

bushy brows are everything honey just
