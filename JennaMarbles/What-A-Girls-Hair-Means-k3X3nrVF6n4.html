brown hair means you probably a nice
person having red hair means you should
probably be my friend now because I'm
going to be extinct in a hundred years

suck your dick I probably have a really
caring personality and if you have some
non human color anywhere that means I'm
gonna suck your dick I'm such a creative
free spirit that covers everyone now
let's move on to hair styles baring your
hair straight down like this means I'm
trying to impress you but now my hair is

broke up with my boyfriend hair like

that I actually listen to and genuinely
enjoy lil mamas music kiss miss mclarson
side braid means I'm really lazy and
just can't figure it out probably having
that time really like eat lots of
chocolate get really sad about
everything carry a high ponytail means
that I'm wearing it like this because my
face looks really fucked up if you can't
see my hair from the front like this
regular ponytail if your hair isn't a
regular ponytail
