their podcast you guys request videos
like this all the time I have done a
series of what a girl's blank means and
you guys continue to request them I
don't know why you think I know these
things
oh it's does it do among the top two
requested within this umbrella has been
what it girls jewelry means and/or
accessories which is another video and
also what a girl's tattoos and piercings
mean so I'm gonna tackle what a girls
jewelry means because I have a pretty
good grasp on it like jewelry a lot cuz
we all do
show me your jewels oh there's just a
lot of room here great to speak about
your personality so if you're sitting
there now knowing what your jewelry
means I'm gonna tell you and if you see
a girl wearing some jewelry this is what
it means then you can know so you can
know that bitch without further ado
here's what a girl's jewelry needs let's
start off with some types shall we
silver jewelry means I can't commit to
real gold for financial reasons
old-fashioned reasons I steal other
people's Wi-Fi it's a hobby of mine
trying to guess all those passwords
yellow gold means I'm so classic ly
trained and taking dick everybody wears
little gold so I mean that's all we all
got here isn't it yellow gold rose gold
means I like choices
why would I just want yellow and white
gold when I could have rose gold why
just have one baby daddy when I could
have lots of baby daddies options are my
friend
it also means I like to trap people
platinum means it's not silver but
thanks for insulting me I'm also better
than you and you're not invited to my
junk party any more jewelry that's made
out of plastic means this isn't the
jewelry that I wanted but then again
neither is this life so why start
complaining that hip jewelry means I
like to get my jewelry at my yoga studio
or it means I'm just wearing this
necklace so that I can smoke it later
I already smoked my other necklace or it
means I wash my clothes in a river a
body chain means I don't really take
this thing off that often which means
someone is definitely judged on it it
also means it hurts my land my back
it also means
where's it going where's it going losing
all to my cheeseburger holder that's
where it's going nowhere provocative at
all chokers mean I love but stuff a lock
it means when I grow up I want to be a
grandma
it also means can't go out tonight
because there's a yard sale early in the
morning tomorrow or it means there's my
shooty business card from a shitty etsy
store real pearls means I actually own a
china cabinet fake pearls means I
actually own a dildo stud earrings means
I can relate to everyone I am everyone
yes I know Glock is extra stud earrings
on a baby mean this is fucking weird and
I'll see myself out hoop earrings mean
I'm too beer cáritas away from taking it
up in the girls bathroom throwing my
blowjob shot in your face and then using
this bar stool as a stripper pole also
can you hold them for me because that
girl is looking at me the wrong way
dangly earrings mean I identify as a sex
kitten but like with the rocker edge my
favorite food is beans salad no these
glasses aren't prescription their cages
mean when I take these out my ears look
like little vaginas
they just also mean I'm either an artist
a starving artist or a cannibal can't
tell which one until you get to know me
roll today's small dainty necklaces mean
I'm saving myself for marriage or until
I get wasted this weekend either way
daddy won't know the difference

me look at me look at me looking oh my
god oh stop looking at me dr. P what are
you looking at chain necklaces mean I
think Florida is exotic I have a 10
dollar gift card to Walmart looks like

teeth with deer antler velvet I assault
