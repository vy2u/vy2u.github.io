video called what a girl's hair means
and ever since then people been
requesting what a girls makeup means and
boo boo I got you so for all my vagina's
out there that don't know what your
makeup says about you but for all my
gentlemen friends out there don't really
know what a girls makeup means I'm here
to tell you because little-known fact
when I was getting my master's degree I
also got a PhD in fucking life so let's
just start with the basics shall we a
girl that has no makeup on means I'm
just fucking hanging out stop judging me
with your eyes see what you're doing
with your eyes stop it because it's
gonna get real awkward later when you
guys are free phone number to try to
explain why you didn't want it right now
look hot fuck you foundation that's too
late or too dark means my skin might
have been that color at one point and
then Sun happened or I can't tell what
my skin color is a line of foundation
where you can see how my face and not on
my neck means okay first of all let's be
positive at least you're not gonna get
any makeup in your mouth when you try
singing Hickey so I'm a considerate
person
it also means we you can put makeup on
your neck think this light proves that
that is news to me going for a really
dewy skin look means let's not take a
picture with flash or not go too close
to the Sun because you might go boy from
looking at my face makeup with a lot of
contouring means I know what I'm doing
just casually changing my bone structure
into a different bone structure like a
makeup plastic surgeon too much comma
Tori means I love Kim Kardashian but I
did this very pink blush means in red
blush means in a really strong cheek
look like this means I just sort of good
light in my house this doesn't look good
on anyone the supernatural I look means
I acknowledge your sexual advances
have a vibrator really colorful eye
makeup means I'm so fun you tell if I
like so fun and playful colors really
gold eyeliner means wait till you see
what underwear I have a smokey eye needs
I'm gonna try to get laid tonight or if
it's during the day and i have a smokey
eye that means show me your wallet
because I'm a hooker glitter either
means I'm 12
I'm Kesha I'm drunk 4 again I'm a hooker
a face little makeup no makeup on your
eyebrows means you can put makeup on
your eyebrows regular eyebrows means are
you doing really strong eyebrows me I
look into any fashion magazine said
eyebrows mean my boyfriend did my makeup
today
excited eyebrows mean weird my eyebrows
are the wrong color mean some day when I
realized what a horrible mistake I've
made but the lead every picture of me
like this is a dark period and these
eyebrows are graces fake eyelashes means
I took the time to glue tiny pieces of
hair to my eyes trying really hard to
impress you how am i doing not good damn
it too much under eye concealer means
yes so you got shit-faced last night I
may or may not still be drunk right now
lip liner means I'll go my mouth think
about it pink lipstick nude lipstick red
lipstick peach lipstick and dark
lipstick follow me and I'm gonna suck
your dick except the darker the color
the more it's gonna get all over your
fucking dick and if I have gloss on its
