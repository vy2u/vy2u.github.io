living in it so I have made a bunch of
these videos what a girls blank means

what a guys blank means so I decided now
is a great time to start including the
guys in this magical series I have going
because I know everything about
everything you can see it hanging up on
the wall says I have a PhD in everything
I decided that for my first topic was
going to be what a guy's facial hair
means and not to be insensitive to
genders here ladies can have facial hair
too ok I see you Kathy Bates but for the
sake of a title let's just say what a
guy's facial hair means game cool with
that ok because your facial hair serves
as a source of self-expression like your
hair or your clothes and the way that
you wear your facial hair can say a lot
about you as a person so without further
ado here is what a guy's facial hair
means a guy that's clean-shaven means
I'm 12 or it means I'm 11 or it means
I'm 9 okay stop it
or it means I hate my boss and my job
but I'm a slave to corporate America

bit of hair on my face because if I
don't have any people keep trying to
lure me into their cars with candy kind
of look like a baby in the face you know

how I treat all of my relationships
unattended to a regular mustache means
without this you would never recognize
me
it also means I like my women like I
like my beer in my mouth in Mexico

unreasonably strong forearms dad

puberty or it means oh can I pay for

don't wear ties I only wear wooden bow
ties or it means I have a vintage camera
tattooed on my outer thigh but when you
look at it from the side it looks like a
raptor high-fiving David Hasselhoff it's
rad

mustache means I deliver things to
people on my bike
also my bike was your bike you should
get a better luck next time or it means
