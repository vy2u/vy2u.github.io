of me going to get some fish with my
boyfriend Julian and I have since taken
that video down and I've seen a lot of
people I did write a response on Twitter
as to why I was taking you down and
there's still a lot of people that are
like very confused as to what happened
and I first of all I didn't sleep
Wednesday through Thursday because this
was like it was completely just like
destroyed I was like sobbing all day on
Thursday I fell asleep last like at like
8:00 p.m. or something and just woke up
so I'm laying in bed this morning
and I'm just like how can I make this a
teachable moment a fixable moment where
I can show people my mistakes so that
people don't do it again instead of just
taking it down like I'd like to at least
be like making this into something where
people can have a better idea of what to
do in the future and what not to do in
the future because I made a mistake and
it was my fault and I feel terrible for
it and I know a lot of you at least that
saw the video when it was up and even
now are like this is ridiculous and I
totally understand that attitude but to
me it's not ridiculous and to I'm sure a
lot of people that have fishes pets
don't see it as ridiculous so um I guess
I just want to like say a couple things
about it I think maybe at the end of
this I am gonna include the video so you
can see what I did
and hopefully that will be enough reason
for someone to not make that mistake
again instead of it just not being on
the internet like I'd like to have it be
something where you can at least learn
what not to do and you know why I made a
mistake and you know why other people
make mistakes ooh some of the criticism
that I had received after I got my
hamster add was that I was you know
getting a pet like on an impulse on a
whim and didn't know enough about them
to take care of them and all that was
sort of valid except for the fact that
like when I'm getting a new pet they're
like my family members
so maybe I don't have all the most
perfect information up front before I
get them but I am fully ready and
willing and responsible enough to know
that I'm going to do anything that I can
while they're with me they you know
everything that they do in their life is
as a result of my effort and I'm going
to take care of them to the best of my
ability I'm not a person that's gonna go
get a pet and then decide like oh you
know I really don't want this and then
you know get rid of them or give them
away and like although the videos do
seem very spontaneous of me going and
getting a hamster for example I promise
you that my level of responsibility is
completely there my heart is completely
there and as you saw with add although I
didn't make like a longer follow-up
video with that you saw a look through
Julian's vlogs and my snapchat and in
the future with that like I will do
anything to make sure that you were a
happy hamster and I'm sorry that I went
to Petco or Pet Smart wherever I went
and you know got what was available
there to me and that wasn't what was the
best friend because Edie serves the best
he's my son you can thaw so with the
fish from learning from that experience
if I'm gonna get a fish I'm going to go
to the most you know wonderful fish
place I'm gonna get some really good
advice I'm gonna get someone that's
gonna tell me everything that I need to
know and you know really set this up
right and make sure that that these fish
are like king fish you know I want them
to have a great life and a great time
while they're in my house it's a small
locally privately owned aquarium
specific store and they have glowing
online reviews about a knowledgeable
staff about people that know what
they're talking about and I had read a
couple of those reviews that were like
you know I was a beginner and I went in
here and they really helped me so I
thought that I was doing these fish a
service by getting them from someone
that actually cared about where they
were gonna go and like yeah
all of this again is my fault because
it's my job to be informed about the
fish
and where they should live and how they
should live not the person selling them
to me and I should have done a better
job off the bat by just maybe going in
there with an idea of what it what a
good first fish first fish for me to
have was and you know just educating
myself in that level but I didn't I went
in there and I was hoping that someone
could educate me a complete beginner on
fish sort of I mean as an adult a
complete beginner and you know help me
pick out something that was going to be
good for me and my experience with fish
in the past has been you know I come
from a time in the United States where
it wasn't uncommon to win a goldfish
at a carnival you know and I think
that's part of the whole where oh
they're just fish comes from because you
know you could win a fish and then we'd
go home and put them in a bowl and they
might die so people are like oh it's
just a fish well you know have a little
fishy funeral for him but that's not the
case obviously they're living beings
they deserve to have a nice environment
just like anybody else and I had had
some successful fish when I was a little
older I had goldfish and you know I was
like I think I understand what it takes
to have a fish and you know even if it's
far more intensive than that I'm willing
to do that because I'm an adult now and
I'd like to have some fish I think it'd
be great so it wasn't my lack of wanting
to have them or wanting to take care of
them
it was my lack of information going in
so that I could preemptively make sure
that they had a good place to live for
fuck's sake sorry that camera just died
so anyways I went into a nice specialty
fish store and I was hoping they could
set me up a fish appropriate for my
skill level and a tank appropriate for
my skill level and I was really counting
on that person to help me their
expertise because you know it's not like
I had never been exposed to any fish
things in the world I had in the past as
a younger person
and I had as an adult sort of a little
bit you know like I know that I don't
want a saltwater fish or a shark or
something that needs a hundred gallon
tank you know I would like something
small and you know that I can take care
of without being a fish expert and that
if I would like to continue to move into
that hobby that I can grow and learn and
you know expand my knowledge like that
so I was really counting on this person
to recommend something to me rather than
me going in there with a certain set of
ideas about you know what I thought was
good for me as a beginner so as you'll
see in the video it shows us going in
there and the guy had said - I don't I
want to disclose the place I mean maybe
in the future I will if people are
curious but they did really have really
nice reviews and I'm not trying to blow
up their spot really like I'm not trying
to say you know these people did this to
me you know fuck then like I don't I
don't really know some people might have
a really great experience with them
maybe they are really great I don't know
but this was my experience and I'm not
trying to like drag them personally but
I went in and he told me to pick a tank
size first and then we'll work that way
in order to pick a fish that's
appropriate for that and appropriate for
my skill level because I was like you
know I know I don't know anything and
you know I'm new to having a fish and I
need something for like a beginner and
you know he explained to me the larger
the tank the easier it is to clean and
that you know we should get the largest
tank that we can feasibly get and you
know work that way
so you'll see in the videos that he
recommended a circular tank to me
although it looks kind of small in the
video it is 8 gallons you know it's not
super tiny and a lot of people were
saying to me you know the general rule
is like one gallon per fish basically or
one to two depending on what the fish
are and the the fish that he told me to
get were we gave me a bunch of options
the one
so we decided we're petrol Barb's or
Barb's so basically they'll grow to like
two or three inches maybe and so yeah
they might eventually grow out of that
but you know he didn't explain that to
me
but in theory yes that was enough space
for them just based on that but I have
since learned when I posted this video
because it's a really cool tank there's
you know LED lights and like bubbles and
stuff it's rad but that the circular
tanks are illegal in some countries
because it's seen as cruel so they
basically just like swim around I think
there's predators there distorts their
vision like it's not good for them and
obviously I would have never bought a
circular tank if I had known that but
you know again this is my fault for
going in there and not knowing that and
it also is kind of discouraging to me
that we in America would even sell that
as an option if it's not good for a fish
and you know I got a lot of comments
from people being like I have a bio our
butts really great like this is
ridiculous like don't worry about it but
like if there's any question like how
hard is it to get a rectangle tank not
hard for me you know what I mean like
who cares and also again the bubble the
center filtration there I did he did get
me to get a heater in there a
thermometer so that the temperature was
correct and all of that but someone had
told me in the comments of my video that
the center bubble column it sort of ends
like right here and that there was a
power outage one time and he had a betta
fish in there in the same size as mine
which is in the comments I read probably
appropriate for maybe one betta fish
maybe and the power went out and his
betta fish swam like into that and like
basically killed itself so I live in
Southern California do you guys have
seen when we have like blackouts and
stuff it's like it happens too often for
me to not consider that as something to
be really worried about I don't want my
fish to kill themselves so like fuck no
I'd rather have something from the top
or they can't just swim in there like
fuck man like come on dude
help me out here I don't want my bitch
today we picked that tank because he had
suggested to get the biggest size tank
that we could but I was like you know I
don't I'm not gonna get a 50 gallon tank
like you know I'd like something that
could fit on a tabletop and have you
know maybe I was thinking going in there
I was like give one fish and like having
these thing you know I I don't know like
you tell me I need some help and do we
pick that tank and there was no like you
know you should get a rectangular tank
or you know there was no discussion it
was like these are probably good it's
like a whole set up for like be a nurse
you know they got everything you need in
there just get this guy and then all
right over here we got some some Barb's
some you know he threw out tetras air
tetras our different fish and you know
all these other like walked us down and
I was like here's all the freshwater
fish and you know these are some good
ones that you can start off with and I'm
like okay and then I was like I don't
know what to put in here like is there
gravel he's like it comes with gravel
and then he pointed me to like the bio
where he was like these are probably the
nicest you know decorations you should
put in there and so he sold us on like a
actual box full of all that stuff that
you saw it was like okay cool and he
explained to me sort of the cycle you
know that we should wait as long as we
can to introduce them into the water
where is now I realized that this needed
to be done like a month ahead of time
because the the fish need if you guys
want to do research if you ever would
like a fish you know check out Taylor
Nicole Dean who's been a blessing to me
in the aftermath of this I it's really
invaluable to have her opinion and
thoughts it's like the mistake I made
when I was younger when you would win a
goldfish unfair and you're like dad help
me set it up and you know you put him in
a nice bowl and he dies like you can't
just put a fish into some water even
with conditioner even with the
biological whatever because they they
need it to be the pH balanced the
ammonia the nitrates and all this stuff
needs to be right for them to live in
and
you know he did sort of make it sound to
me that by adding these things to the
water and letting it set up for a while
and adding their water and that it was
gonna be OK for them and it's not it's
not okay I'm upset that I trusted
someone else's expertise it seems silly
to go into a place where you're like I
believe that you're trying to help me
and like Wikipedia everything that he's
saying to me on my own and be like
actually get thought but basically the
the little barbs that he then
recommended to go into that tank you
know they're like their school fish they
like to be in a school they like to be
with their friends and they need like a
nice long like at least thirty gallon
tank to swim back and forth and like
have a good time with their buddies and
had I known that I would have never put
them into a circular tank alone
basically after I uploaded the video to
where a lot of people you know this is
their experience as well is you go into
a place you have some knowledge not
really obviously the best knowledge or
enough knowledge but you do have some
knowledge or experience and you know you
take someone else's word in good faith
and you come home and you do the best
that you can and you obviously want your
fish to have a wonderful environment you
want to see your fish being like this is
fucking great I'm having a great time
nobody wants to see their fish be like
wow this sucks I hate millet opposed to
the video and I started getting feedback
obviously of like first first and
foremost no circle tank don't do that
and I'm like fuck okay that's something
I can fix I can fix that I can get them
a bigger tank no problem second like
those plastic plants in there like
that's not good for them like they need
natural plants obviously like their
natural environment okay fuck all right
let me fix that I can do that I can work
on that the filter obviously the person
telling me the power going out
going in there fuck ok let's get rid of
this tank and then people you know
telling me he shouldn't have sold you
those Barb's you know they they need a a
big 30 gallon tank there they're gonna
grow it be a couple inches they need
more space than that and I'm like fuck
ok I'll do anything I'll do anything
that it takes and then as I started to
look more and more into it I realized
like basically my fish are suffering
right now so because there's no
established like cycled system in there
basically when they poop in pee they
create ammonia and then they're supposed
to be a good level of bacteria in that
tank already that eats that ammonia so
to fish cycle the tank you know it takes
a little while for those fish to live in
there and some might die which is what
he was explaining to me and like that's
just part of the system but since the
fish community has sort of made their
way around that and have created a
fishless cycle for their tanks so that
they don't have to have little fish that
live in an awful environment and die in
order to get your tank ready for fish to
live in it that's one thing that I am
really grateful to the fish community on
YouTube and the Internet as well is that
instead of people giving me feedback
that was making me feel like some
monster for following the directions of
someone that didn't necessarily have my
or the fish's best interest at heart
they were normalizing my experience and
genuinely trying to help me moving
forward what is the best thing to do for
these fish and I really appreciate that
and I already felt horrible enough as it
is
once I realized that I had made a
mistake and what doesn't help is when
people are like fuck you for doing this
you're a piece of shit like this was an
honest mistake and I am really sorry to
the fish I am sorry to anyone that
thinks that they should do this or like
I I sat with the guilt of the fact that
I have a in the other room a tank full
of fish that don't deserve to be in that
environment and you know I thought I was
do
something fun and happy and it wasn't
thanked for fuck's sake it sucks it
doesn't help when someone reminds you
that you're a terrible person it feels
bad man
so I genuinely appreciate that people
were you know not only trying to help me
but they were normalizing this as you
know before I became a fish expert I did
the same thing and I had fish die and it
really sucks and it feels terrible and
you know it's something that people do
go through not because they want to but
because sometimes this is the
information that is you know available
to us and at this point with the
internet this is my fault there is no
excuse I should have done this
beforehand I should have had a tank
doing its thing for a month so that I
can introduce some fish in a safe way
this is my fault so after I uploaded the
video it did reach out to Taylor who by
the way if you are looking to get a fish
hurt and there's a bunch of other
channels solid-gold aquatics is the
other girl that commented on my channel
but there's like there's a really rad
fish community on YouTube and I of
course found them all after the fact and
Taylor Nicole Dean by the way as
everything was sort of going on I fell
down a serious cheese hole which is
cheese as one of her fish and now I'm
emotionally invested in cheese but I
just I really appreciate that the fish
community sort of was like okay Jenna
you know you sort of fucked up but like
here's what you can do now and I did I
asked Taylor at DM Taylor on Twitter I
need to know now that I've done this
what is the most ethical thing for me to
do at this point now that the fish are
in a environment that's you know not
balanced for them ready it's not ready
yet
do I leave them in there do I continue
to let them sort of like help the tank
go through this natural cycle do I move
them into a bigger tank and you know
have them do it in there do I give them
back to the pet store because you know
it's sort of unethical to leave them in
that day
and Taylor gave me a couple of options I
want to just tell you from my
perspective and why why I got here I
didn't want to leave the fish in that
tank and most of the information that
was you know being bestowed upon me was
that you know you change 25% in the
water every single day so that the
ammonia buildup in there isn't enough to
like harm them and totally willing to do
that no problem but it felt wrong like
those fish are basically in there with
not good bacteria it's not great it's
the wrong shape the wrong size they're
not having a good time there's no
natural plants bad time bad time all
around bad water bad fun bad time and to
move them into another tank with even
more water and even more space and not
natural plants than there's like you
know I'm just asking them to do that
process on an even bigger scale and now
an even more stressful scale and to me
the most ethical thing to do was to get
them out of the environment that I had
put them in immediately and to get them
back into water that was safe for them
into an environment that wasn't gonna
hurt them like the plastic plants no
good for them they're gonna cut their
little fins on there no fun they don't
like them there to me there was no other
option like yes I could go into that
room and change 25% in the water every
day hoping that they're gonna live
through it and hoping that everything's
gonna be okay and I can cycle my tank
but I just I literally could not look at
them being like yeah I hope you live
it's like no fuck no I want to get you
out of here so that you can be in a
place that's good for you I put you in a
bad environment that is my fault not
yours why should you have to suffer the
consequences of my bad decision do you
know I'm saying that's what it felt like
to me so although I know some of you are
probably like you know you could have
fixed the tank it's not a big deal you
know just let them live but to me it's
like I put my fish and I'm in a bad
place
so I'm gonna make it right and I'm gonna
put them in the right place so we
brought the fish back to the place that
I got them
and I was like you know I want to talk
to the guy that sold me these fish and
told me that this was a good environment
for them and told me what to do I want
to tell him you know hey man I
double-checked and it turns out
everything you told me was kind of
fucked and so I went in there being like
it took a while to get our fish used
safely into a bag so we could bring them
back and it was really hard to like do
that because I was now emotionally
attached to them I love them I want them
to be happy but knowing that I was doing
something that was ultimately right for
them and gonna help them and I wasn't
gonna make them suffer through a new
cycle process they didn't deserve that
so I went in there being like I'm gonna
tell this guy like hey man fuck you and
I went in there I've been crying all day
and I went in there and I was like I
have to give these fish back to you like
I don't want my money back and I want
man I just I had to get back to it I
just started crying like a baby and he
was like what's wrong can I give you
credit like you know and I was like
these fish don't you guys sir told me in
a circle tank and you said that was okay
with plastic plants and a filter that
they could in theory get into and you
guys you said that that was right and
these fish you know they act like crying
they'd grow to be like a couple inches
and they need to be in a school and they
need to swim back and forth and they
needed like you know have other fish
there eventually and he was like yeah
there's a lot of bad information online
isn't there you know and I was like so
confused because clearly the information
that people were giving me was like a
resounding no circle tanks like those
fish need to be in a 30 gallon tank that
you they need to be in a school and that
here's this guy the expert that's
telling me that all of that was
misinformation and I just got like
really discouraged you know like you're
the person selling them when everyone
else in the fish community is saying
that this is what the fish need
what the fuck man what the fuck he was
like they're fine it was fine and I'm
like no it's not fine I was like I just
I want you to take it back and I want
you to put them back in the tank so you
know they can be in a environment that's
safe for them and where they don't
they're not gonna die because I'm stupid
it sort of just made me realize like
obviously I care about fish obviously I
care about other living beings I
literally don't eat animals like I care
I care about my pets I want them to be
happy yeah
those fish could have lived in that tank
just fine and everyone that had told me
that is totally right the you know we
can make it work so they can live in
there and that's fine but an analogy I
think that helps me understand is like
with my dogs or dogs in general is like
yeah a German Shepherd could live in a
one-bedroom apartment and spend eight
hours a day in a crate and survive but
it's alright for him you know it's not
the place that he should be and if you
care about that dog you you wouldn't
make him do that just because you love
him and you want him to like be with you
you know so I wanted to do right by
those animals and this whole thing's
been a really big learning experience
for me obviously and that's I guess
that's my biggest takeaway is that I
would have loved to have provided a fish
or a couple of fish a really lovely
environment it's not that I'm unprepared
once I get them to take care of them and
do everything that it takes
I had just failed them in the beginning
by not having an environment ready for
them and my only option after this point
was to just make sure that they were in
a safe environment so in the future when
you're like Jenna where's your fish
they're not here I brought them to a
place where they'd be better off and you
know someday if I decide that I'm not
completely scarred by this experience
because it has been kind of traumatic
for me that if I would like to you know
get a fish so that I would I would like
to make sure
that I do it the right way and that
there's an environment appropriate for
them before they even come in so
obviously this is like it's pretty awful
for me to post it's like pretty it's
like tearing you up inside obviously
like I don't I don't want to put my
video up but I want this to be something
that maybe not only normalizes your
experience or you know prevents anyone
in the future from making this mistake
with fish in particular because people's
attitudes about fish is a lot like what
that guy's is is like you know whatever
fucking and they'll just well they're
fine
their fish whatever but to me it was
like I feel powerful I just want to
fucking crawl in a hole and die today
like I can't believe that I did this I
feel terrible I am gonna put the video
up so you can see a step-by-step
tutorial of how not to get a fish and
how to set up their environment
completely wrong and I'm gonna link some
channels in the description that have
some good information about fish some
solid information about fish if you're
curious about doing this and you don't
want to make the same mistake that I did
and even though it hurts me and it's
embarrassing and I feel literally
fucking awful I'm trying to make this
into a positive thing and at least
prevent someone else from seeing my
video and being like all that circle
thanks cool I want to go get one even if
this is it my expense like I feel
fucking terrible I don't think I could
feel worse at this point but like I want
to just make sure that no one else does
that and then has to feel like that
because it's it really sucks man and I
want to say thank you to the fish
community you guys are really kind and
thoughtful and you made me feel like I
wasn't alone that this is a common
mistake and that you know sometimes
people that work in these stores this is
a thing that they do they sell you a
fish that's going to need a bigger and
bye
and you know they make it they set you
up to fail so that your fish die and you
come in with a million questions to keep
buying more fish and bigger fish and
with bigger spaces so they set you up in
this like you know they're like getting
you addicted to drugs basically it's
like yeah I'll sell you this crack and
then eventually you're gonna need a
crack cave you know what I'm saying
if there's something that you do take
away from the video I hope that you see
how like genuine I am and that like I
just want some fish that have a nice
place to live and then I didn't do this
out of any malice or with any intentions
other than like I'd like to have some
fish you know they're great they're cool
I want them to live in my house and I am
prepared to take care of them and do
everything that they need but right now
I done fucked up and you know did this
wrong I hope I've done enough here to
make sure again that you know this is
not what you should do and if you want
to know what to do there's lots of
resources please if you ever have a
friend or anybody that's like I want to
get a fish make sure that you like point
them in a good direction yeah this sucks
I'm so incredibly sorry and I hope that
I did enough for the the fishies to get
them back into a better environment so
that they did not have to sight
painfully cycle a tank themselves a tank
that wasn't right the wrong size the
wrong shape with no natural fun fucking
plants in there for them like nothing
fun in there for them and in the future
if I choose to do this I will gladly and
happily make a video about the right way
to do it so for those of you that are
like this is stupid and like way too
extra I apologize but to a lot of people
it's not and to me it's not and these
are living breathing beings and I just
want them to have a good life and I
fucked up I'm really sorry I hope that
this is like enough to prevent anyone
else from doing this and know that I
feel really really terrible about it and
that's you know that's it and it's not
like with the fish it wasn't like adware
it was like oh my god I'll fix it right
away it was like no there they're gonna
continue to suffer because of my bad
choice and you got to make it right
right now like you can't just get him a
bigger tank so I mean as much as I
wanted to continue to give the fish a
bigger and better and amazing fun
environment for them like it would have
required them to suffer through that and
I'm just I wouldn't be able to like go
to sleep at night honestly I can't
here's the video it's a step-by-step
tutorial of what not to do if you would
like to get a fish most of the video is
just me being annoyed Julian so take
that for what it is but here is the
video this is what happened to the video
I hope you understand I am incredibly
sorry it did not mean to disappoint
anybody or make anyone mad or do wrong
by any animals so again I really
apologize and I hope that if you're
looking into getting some fishies just
don't do what I did just don't do don't
do it there you go I will see you next
week okay
harder oh I didn't say it I'm gonna get
some fish sheets I don't know just like
up maybe like got nothing no salt water
maybe was like a freshwater guy like
he'll be easy and little what I don't
know see I don't know that much about
fish I haven't had one since I was
younger I had two goldfish but then one
of them like ate the other one it does
why are you thinking that for I don't
know what could go well I don't get to
feel bad sometimes I feed out everything
I know
well we feed him at the same time is add
just a little sprinkle here fish photo
well sprinkle adds seeds and nuts
somewhere where if there's an earthquake
he's gonna be all gay fun really you
don't seem excited
no do I get to name it
that's the compromise you can name it no
one's gonna want to dog-sit anymore
because they have to see the zoo so I
assume is this my sanctuary this was
your reaction when I asked for added now
he's like your actual best friend in the
world you hurt it we're going to get a
new friend listen okay hear me out I
know a lot of you are like Jenna you
have so many animals you can't just keep
acquiring animals I woke up today
wanting to do one of two things I either
wanted to absolutely decorate the shit
out of my house with Christmas
decorations and even I recognized my too
much gene and was like Thanksgiving
hasn't even happened yet
it's not okay or acquire a new friend
for our family I know we joke about my
age all the time that I'm like 31 and
have a basketball game MA which is all
very true also a Virgo
I'm also never wrong but like I feel
like I'm at the age where all I want to
do is just mother something to death and
I read a comment recently and on one of
our hamster videos that was like I can't
wait to see what animal Jenna gets next
so she can mother it to death which is
so completely true but I really like
Jillian I do want to have kids but like
we need a couple of things before we get
there it's like overwhelming so I was
like what kind of pet can we get because
you know even a mammal is probably too
much even a bird is probably too much
I'm being realistic here we could get a
little fishy guy I asked Julian prairie
cat just about every day and Julian says
no so I feel like a Fisher is a good
compromise yeah it is I can't have
plants they'll all die I never like
that's what my mothering too much gene
is like too much I either just like
trench them and drown them I did it
we're gonna get a fishy guy I don't know
what kind they're converting one and I
need something that's at least gonna
survive with my basketball game tomorrow
we're coming
Plus her do you play pub gee well that
guy's a big one what's your favorite sub
n it your tank when you buy it your tank
in one week
can you get me a free life on HQ please
do play HQ I like him I like him a lot
you look like ad they make it looks like
a boy I know these guys are like really
connecting with me right now
we finish it off we have not picked out
the fish school
penta Barb's he said five or six the one
we're gonna think of are at the bar
thank you give me a name of all the bars
yeah they like to hang out little school
and they're gonna miss their friends
it's gone dark okay we had a lot of
learning to do but that guy was so
helpful okay he was really really really
helpful
he made sure that we got fishies that
were good - like establish an ecosystem
in there and like weren't gonna fight
each other we got five right not six by
five tetra barbs is that what they felt
at your bar named after barb from
strange I think we got five bars y'all
this is some real justice survive the
only barb so we're gonna take them home
they're gonna have a lot of time to
chill out while we get their tank ready
so that we make sure we have the right
setup for them and Julian will name them
all are you excited yeah they look I'm
so excited I think it's gonna be such a
nice little addition to our family
to the no bars permits very curious he
just jumped on the table and almost
stepped on their bag this is like a nice
solid surface yeah if there's an
earthquake what we don't know is that
tetra bombs to go flying I know used to
wash everything look at this terrifying
picture do not place in direct sunlight
because it can concentrate light rays
can cause a fire I like farms but I also
don't want to catch it on fire very
informative to my Aries partner Julian
disconnect the power before you ever
reach into the water okay Julian never
carry or pull the unit by the electrical
cable are you listening
Julian we got this really nice selection
of things since they're freshwater fish
we chose that on my cell fresh watery
selection of things except you taught us
one except for this because Julian
insisted on getting this does that have
a name yeah okay we will ask you Carl
let's spell coral
you excited yeah
Julian you just mushroom don't Ares this
up okay I kind of want to live in there
stop being nasty the heater and
thermometer back there I cannot get this
fucking ball to stay down
oh my god we're gonna do a half a cap of
that so that it gets nice and ready
we're gonna make sure the temperature is
good do some biological booster to add
some bacterial cultures in there that's
all for that stupid ball give up on the
ball I'm a good fish parent kill the
boost I think we did it this is fucking
amazing I want it to be red I don't want
it to be green now I want it to be blue
the statue isn't centered it's charged
oh my god do you know them fuck it just
so you can strengthen the statue Oh our
so we're gonna let this run for a little
while
make sure it's the right temperature
we'll see you in a little while here at
the barbs they're so cute they poop in
their water a bunch they've just been
hanging out try and get your water in
here with the new water so you can start
feel look it they're like let us out
already so they're gonna acclimate and
just kind of like stay still for a while
so this has been going for quite a while
now the guy at the fish store did say to
let it cycle for 24 hours and I was like
is it possible to do it at all today and
he said yeah but there is a chance that
you know they're not gonna acclimate
well and they might die but that they
might also do that after 24 hours
because they're new fishing and you take
so I mean I'm a little concerned because
the Wonka bars to live certainly doesn't
been 24 hours but like we've been having
the tank go for quite some time
put a little bit of the tank water in
with their water this seems so extras no
they'll die either way
he did prepare me but anytime you're
starting a new tank some fish might die
so I'm really pulling for all of our
barbs and we're trying our best here
please if you're on the Internet and
your fish care elitist know that I have
not had a fish since I was a child I'm
trying my best
just like with ad like if I make some
mistakes in the comments you can try and
help me understand but know that I want
the best for my fish I really do I'm not
trying to do anything wrong but if I do
don't yell at me okay I have a lot of
things some other page up do you want to
see the fishies I'm trying to wait like
as long as possible to put them in well

a little skittish and they keep hiding

to come out y'all can hide in there for
a little while until you feel ready the
end of this video isn't very exciting
because they're just in there hanging
out getting used to their new home and
Julian has fallen asleep because we
waited so long so that they can have a
tank that was the most well-adjusted we
could make it it's not very exciting
right now but I will do my best to keep
you updated on snapchat as how things go

the best that I could I hope all of them
live through a new tank experience I
love them very much I'm a little iffy on

looks really nice it's so relaxing and
fun to sit by they're just like little

little bit of time to adjust if you
don't follow me on snapchat hopefully
next week I'll be able to just show you
a quick quick update of how they're
doing I'm optimistic that we followed
the instructions and we're gonna have
some nice little barbs in there right
