thank you um you know I was supposed to
be in Cancun this week I was supposed to
be rolling around on the beach in my
like triangle little tiny baby nipple

unfortunate series of events basically
barstool didn't sell enough trips for us

money so combination of a lot of things
we didn't get to go and we're not going
and I am so heartbroken I am so upset I
want to go to Cancun so bad first of all
I need to thank Bella beachwear because
this is a company that I used to order
what studio order all of my bathing
suits from um they're inexpensive
everything's like plain and not crazy
there's not like mad crazy stuff
happening it's just a nice cute bathing
suit so I've been ordering from them
from years I reach out to them because
jenna Marbles channel is not one big
fucking commercial for things that you
don't want um
yeah you're welcome just kidding um I
reached out to them and I was like hey
I'm going to Cancun ah can I get a free
bikini if I like put it in my videos I'm
like hey thanks Bella betray and they're
like oh yeah sure and they sent me
bikinis and now we're not going to
Cancun so I'm like how am I gonna do
this like how am I gonna say thank you
in my video for these bikinis that
fishes that means - bikinis was so nice
of her and I was like how I'm gonna say
thank you so like basically if you watch
this video out of context you're like
all its girls a horror walk around in
their bathing suit but this is really
what I was gonna do in Cancun I was
really gonna put that shit on roller on
the beach all week and make videos in
Cancun in like no clothes and I don't
want to deprive you guys of that like

what you missed by us not going to cake
