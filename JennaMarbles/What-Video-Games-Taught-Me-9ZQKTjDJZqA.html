what's up brother ghosting oh my gosh
Paul I'm wearing a sweater Oh bubble
stop ruining everything see you you
sneaky Mexican kitty so today's video I
have made a couple of these in the past
I did what kid shows taught me with
Disney movies taught me so I wanted to
talk about something that's near and
dear to many of our hearts which is
video games you spend hours and hours
and hours playing them oh my god I woke
my pajamas where am I
all I've been eating is cheez-its and
coke all day we've all been there okay I
won't judge you but now looking back I
would like to reflect on some things
that video games have taught me and it
may or may not make sense a bunch of
nonsense so pac-man first of all my
experience with pac-man includes waiting
to go into the dentists and playing the
actual machine pac-man taught me that
mmm delicious things to eat are cherries
strawberries and your friends Pokemon
taught me that capturing and
incarcerating free creatures and then
forcing them to grow inside a four inch
ball makes you like a legendary trainer
kind of like CrossFit Tetris taught me
that I have absolutely zero planning
skills I mean you know that Z is coming
and every time it comes it's like
whatever that note says that's my life
zero blending skills ahh
farmville taught me that I'm going down
friend you on facebook forever
don't we request me again either because
I don't want to play farmville ever stop
it bitch some of you may or may not
remember this game but the Oregon Trail
like the one that they make you play
like fifth grade so that you learn about
fucking people
pioneers coming West or whatever you're
in trail taught me that snakes really do
not want you to get to Orion and it also
taught me that if you travel anywhere
without a doctor you will die there are
no doctors anywhere to be found so
unless you have like a travel companion
that has a PhD in snakebites you're
gonna die you can't even go to 7-eleven
without a doctor you're gonna die snakes
gonna bite you
that's what the Oregon Trail tabhi koala
duty and actually all other shooting
games taught me that bitch gets shot
you're just gonna like hide for
literally like just go chill you know
relax kick it the Bloods gonna get out
of your eyes look you'll be fine okay
you don't even go to a hospital nothing
needs to happen five seconds tops and
that bullet will just expel itself from
your skin you're ready to go fucking
shoot people in the face
FIFA taught me that no I still don't
like soccer is anyone Grand Theft Auto
taught me that if you die all that
happens is just wake up in the hospital
with less money you know makes sense
like you went to the hospital and you
paid for it out of pocket like you have
no insurance so there's that grand that
auto also taught me if you were allowed
to just drive as recklessly as you
wanted you'd eventually just get really
bored of it and start driving normal
again because you do it over it let's
follow the traffic rules that sounds
exciting
Grand Theft Auto also taught me that
running a red light for like fucking 30
likes nobody gives a shit right but if
you push someone mmm cops are all over
your dick they will not stand for
pushing no pushing we're all adults here
during the blind eye to your horrible
driving skills you are not allowed to
push someone the other thing Grand Theft
Auto taught me is that the girlfriend
character she like really cares about
what you're wearing she wants you to
change your motherfucking clothes but
she never changes heart fucking outfit
and on top of that does she care that
you're out murdering people all day
every day no but you're close and that's
a deal breaker or the fucker that's a
problem you got to change those I don't
care who you murder but when you come
home and you want to fuck me you better
change those clothes and the last thing
Grand Theft Auto taught me which is my
personal favorite is that it's okay to
touch a stripper as long as you flirt
with her where the Warcraft taught me
that ah no I don't watch his movie
cookie clicker taught me nothing except
my fucking hand hurts Super Mario
Brothers taught me a whole bunch of shit
find something on the ground you should
fucking eat it
I mean don't touch it don't check it out
first you should fucking eat it because
chances are one of three things is gonna
happen to you you're gonna like get huge
like you're on steroids you're gonna get
a bunch of fucking turtle shells or it's
acid area trip balls it also taught me
that if you see something that you don't
know it's not you she fucking kill it
die I don't want to friend you I don't
want to get to know you you're getting
in my path the fuck on my face you're
dead it's basically more hardcore than
like Scarface and also taught me it's
not gay of your brothers and according
to Super Mario that when you die you
scream like a baby you go flying up in
the air and then you go underground
that's how you die it also taught me
that when you accomplish something you
fucking jump up on a flagpole and let
everybody know look at me I fucking
accomplished something just in case
everyone didn't see now I'm not gonna
fucking flagpole in if the kids see you
then you just scream your name from the
top of the flagpole because you're
selfish asshole
mariya way to teach humility Mario Super
Mario Brothers also taught me that if
you find a giant fucking coin you know
we should do just run into it and just
go straighten your bank account it also
taught me that if ever you come across
the sewer you should just jump in it
because it's definitely a shortcut to
work filled with money nothing Bad's
gonna happen at all down there just
fucking money and then you pop up and
your girlfriend's there and you got a
raging boner Super Mario Brothers also
taught me that if you like a girl uh you
know you should just travel through 25
fucking worlds to go find her
because I mean I don't even know too
much about it but do they even really
know each other they will I mean they
seem like they could from different
places right he looks like a fucking
janitor and his overalls in his hat and
his mustache and she's a princess wears
like white gloves and a tiara and a gown
uh you know I'm not really sure how many
times their paths really cross so we
didn't know each other that well but it
taught me to just fucking swing for the
kid you like a girl you don't even know
if she has a boyfriend anymore I'm just
gonna I'm just gonna relentlessly chase
this bitch I mean does Mario know that
there's other pussy to be had in the
world Super Mario Brothers taught me
unending love monogamy even if you don't
know if she's fucking dead Bowser could
have killed her she could be pregnant
with his weird turtle baby by now plus
can we talk about the fact that peach
just never been like fuck you Bowser or
like tried to kick him in his turtle
nuts or like anything she's useless
Paige taught me how to be completely
useless uh if you get kidnapped you
should just do nothing and then wait
around till someone rescues you and
never learn self-defense Mario Party and
shit like she just like hangs out with
him like Mario Kart you think that she
would get a nut not a banana peel you
have been kidnapping me for years
now she like totally hangs out with him
in place with them dude like that's
quite a message that I was sent fuck it
also taught me that if you run into a
brick you're either gonna get drugs or
money sweet it also taught me that if
you get attacked by an enemy all that
happens is that you just like regress
into an infant you shrink super smash
brothers taught me that you can kill all
of your friends you know casually while
you're all on top of an airplane ah but
afterwards everyone's just gonna be
really cool you they don't care
friendships forever even if they die so
yeah that's what I fuckin learned I mean
very valuable things that I use all the
time except do people and think about
what they put out for children or do
they just give zero fucks cuz it feels
like they give zero fucks make sure you
