be put on the open by a white girl I
want to talk about white girls in the
club and what they fucking did typically
the people making fun of girls in the
club or guys because you know they get
to have the outside perspective I'm on
the inside I am an inside perspective
okay I'm a white girl and I am telling
you you need to get the scissors and cut
it the fuck out we as a group of human
beings and talk about white girls have
somehow become like the biggest hot
tourney messes in a club ever known to
the human species and let me just
clarify what I mean by white girls it
doesn't matter that you pride yourself
on being kind of percent Italian baby or
anything else like that you have white
skin you're born America you're native
English speaker you're a wanker we're
all some kind of European mutts right
get over yourself and yes it's true you
can make this argument for girls as a
whole that they just act like this in
the club but it's white girls that I
feel and I feel like I have enough life
experience to know this they're just the
worst offenders the most obnoxious like
we just have the worst reputation and if
you are one of these people you know
maybe you should reflect in for a second
be like oh I'd do that stop it all right
cuz it's fucking bear sing first thing
white girls do at a club is when their
friends come in they fucking scream I
mean yes sometimes it's really exciting
sometimes you haven't seen that person a
while maybe hug then be you know excited
you do not need to scream like the
fucking building is on fire but that's
not the only time girls scream in a club
it is not your song it's nobody's song
it's everyone's song it's just a song
like why the fuck are you so excited
about this song like did you lose your
virginity to that song with your friends
something your gangbang like what is the
significance of it to you do you guys
just sang it together in the car like is
that really worthy of screech that you
know pierces everyone's brain and ruins
their night is it worth it then all of a
sudden white girls turn it into a
completely unnecessary uncalled for
karaoke session in the middle of the
fucking dance floor and they like make a
circle and fucking albo everybody off
the dance floor don't like tripping over
themselves like all fucking spilling
drinks just because for those of you
questioning my my need for calling this
of white girls in the club video I mean
when was the last time you saw Corp
rocking Latino girls doing it Asian
girls doing that black girls doing that
it's white girls you're being your
stereotype next day I can't fucking see
it of all white girls in the club after
they'd had like a few drinks they start
getting real sloppy drunk you know
instead of like going home or something
like that they'd fucking stick around
and they'd let it all hang out I'm
talking ass hanging out titties hanging
you know vaginas hanging out then they
go to the bathroom and they fucking puke
and piss and throw up all over the place
one of them's crying on the ground the
other ones trying to help them up the
other one is like gone we can't find our
friend I got it last night I can't go
cheaper I don't know where my fucking
brothers was I yeah I like my lipstick
huh I mean have you ever gone to the
club and then all of a sudden one of the
stalls and the bathroom is closed
because someone like piss and shit all
over the fucking place I can almost
guarantee you a hundred and seventy six
percent
that that was a fucking hammer white
girl that was the girl everyone was
looking forward no one confinement
they're still on a dance floor they
start a fight with another girl for no
reason over a guy that they don't even
know got drunk and is dancing with
people that Danza had Oh dancing that
you can't know
yeah bitch yeah fat fuck yeah and you
get that like half slow motion fucking
white girl fight it's like no real
punches being thrown is just like weird
claws my favorite too is when girls get
drunk enough and then all of a sudden
their hair looks like this whoever
invented this used to be shot this is
this is not hairdo it's not a good look
that's not that girls show up to the
club looking like this with their hair
like this the fuck is this this is big
this is a booklet what is this next
thing I can't stand is when girls get so
drunk that they then take their shoes
off I mean this is so long for so many
reasons it's it's fucking gross like you
see the girls walking home there
barefoot they're carrying their shoes
they're stumbling all over the place no
no when you go out at night you need to
make like a mini marriage with your
shoot you need to sit in your room
before you get ready look at your shoes
make a commitment to it
I promise no matter how painful and
awful you make my feet feel I might be
bleeding blistering I will not take you
off until I come home we are now married
girls make like hasty little commitments
in their shoes it's like till drunk do
us part no it's still home do us part so
white girls this is my video for you too
please can we please clean it up click
the fuck up because I'm sick and tired
of people looking at me like I'm a
ticking time bomb like I'm talking for
long islands and two kamikazes away from
fucking
ripping my shoes off and shitting all
over the bathroom and spreading it all
over the place with my hands make sure
you subscribe to my channel I put on new
views I'm unique me
Kermit it so stop being fucking drunk
white girls</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
