Cassell are you are you silly so today's
video is not gonna be very haha funny
because I want to talk about why girls
hate each other like I promised and my
sluts on Halloween video a couple months
ago and I know a lot of you don't like
when I make videos like this and you're
like oh wait a week for this I wanted
something funny fucking whatever let me
just remind you that you're watching
videos made by a girl alone in her
bedroom every Wednesday maybe your
expectations are a little bit too high
you need like a hobby or something and
if you do like these videos let me know
because I've been debating doing more of
them on my vlog channel so that they can
be there and not here but since the
sexual Wednesday and we're already here
I'm just gonna do it here so girls first
thing I want to say right off the top is
that it's not your fault that you hate
girls you were taught how to do this in
fact everyone was taught this and what
I'm talking about is the idea of
competition ever since you're a little
kid you learn about you know your test
in school your quizzes are you as good
at sports as other kids are you as
pretty as other kids are you as popular
as other kids you learn that you fit in
a certain rank amongst your peers and
then as you grew up it doesn't go away
girls in college you're still ranting on
their looks and how smart they are
sports that's all still there once you
go into the professional working world
it's it's you're down here and someone's
up here and you want this job and you're
down here or whatever you know
celebrities you're constantly being
ranked on their looks on their bodies on
everything award shows there's always a
winner someone's always the best you are
taught this when you judge someone on
first glance that's not your fault
either because that's just how your
brain works that it goes you know I
think I don't have an idea of what this
is so I'm gonna take that and I'm just
gonna you know done thinking about it I
already got it
let me give you an example I can almost
promise you if you've ever clicked on
one of my videos without ever seen them
before you probably expected something
from seeing a blonde girl in front of
our computer and instead you got a whole
bunch of crazy that you didn't expect at
all right we judge each other everybody
judges each other and the hatred aspect
of it comes from our desire to compete
everybody wants to be the best so
retirement girls they want to be the
prettiest they want to have the best
body they want to be the most popular
the most friends now the best looking
boyfriend whatever if you see a girl
that seemingly has all those things what
do you do fucking hate her
fuck that bitch because she's fucking
hot cute and she has friends and
everyone likes her and her boyfriends
really good luck' him fuck you and then
what happens all we want to do is see
her crumble and fail no one can be that
perfect and how that happiness fuck you
and your fucking happiness we want to
see you go you Shh so that we can feel
better when in reality all you really
need to do is stop comparing yourself
and this is where I'm gonna get all
kinds of sappy as soon as you let go the
fact that you're never gonna be the
prettiest or the best or the
best-looking or the most popular or
everyone likes you soon as you let go of
just competing with people it takes all
the fucking pressure off then you're
free you're free to just be you you
don't have to be better you just have to
be you there's always going to be other
people to compare you to someone else
okay let them do that let them be the
ones to be like this girl is prettier
than this girl and I like this girl's
big titties more than this girl's big
titties they can do that all I want
that's their fucking jump off other
people's job is to break you amongst
other people your job is to be like hey
the one thing that I got going for me is
that there is only one of me
unless there's all there's of me living
in other dimensions but on this earth
there's only one of me and that is the
best thing that I can offer the world
just exactly who I am and then when you
act like that
people are like hey that girl's not
threatening she's fucking so we're don't
even know what to think about that one
oh what's going on what I like I want to
be fucking friends with her and girls we
all have it in us you got something in
there that no one else has and if you
just do that instead of what society
telling you to do then we could all just
feel like hey girl I was going dabs
bitch what do you wanna do today and
this is a hard thing you're gonna deal
with this your whole life people
comparing you and competing with you and
whatever and the more you kind of just
go out they'll set this is my fingle Bri
this is who I am and do get all whatever
come on we can just fucking beat bitches
together you know what I mean like the
vaginas you know I guess in summary I
would just say don't be stopped
competing with each other as much as
possible then we go just please like be
friends we do like borrow each other's
clothes and like hang out have slumber
parties and he Blackhorn together you
know quit fucking judging each other and
shit and even if she's really pretty
you're really ugly or really whatever
you think she's probably just as
insecure as you are she's probably like
oh I'm jealous of that girl's air legs
or I wish you would like me or talk to
me on our own you'll like me we're all
just seeking that acceptance from each
other you know that validation that
you're okay you can say you know so do
that for each other we got to stick
together because there's a bigger
there's a bigger thing we have to
compete against okay lots of cats that
are trying to overtake the world slowly
but surely can apocalypse 2012
