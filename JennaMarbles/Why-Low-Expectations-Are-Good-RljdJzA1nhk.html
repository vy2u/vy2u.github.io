be hi friends so today's video I really
honestly just wanted to sit and talk
about life for a minute this is my
favorite thing to talk about I love
sitting and talking about life and
people that don't like to do that um I
don't know what you're doing because
you're living life so what do you care
about what the fuck is definitely not
going to be a funny video at all and
it's also not a rant and people ask me a
lot they're like Jenna why don't you
make rants anymore honestly because I'm
not angry about anything I think that
you need to have a level of anger in
order to rant and I'm just not angry
think anyone that posts rants on a
regular basis should you know maybe take
up some form of exercise or something
because no one can be that angry so for
those of you that come here for the duty
butter jokes might want to check back
next week for doo doo butter sabado
gigante kidding and I don't usually do
videos like this on this channel anymore
because I have other outlets now have
the podcasts I mean in case you haven't
noticed my channel has been like mostly
me making myself laugh cuz I'm so Benny
Jenna you're not funny I know but I'm
good at making me laugh so there's that
what I wanted to talk about is the idea
of having low expectations and I know
that that has such a negative
connotation it's associated with failure
or something not good and I just
completely 100% disagree I think that
having lower no expectations is one of
the most powerful things that you can do
if you can use it to your advantage
Jenna what the fuck are you talking
about let me just explain I feel like in
my life I've seen a lot of people around
me be very disappointed that their life
isn't exactly what they wanted it to be
or expected it to be I don't like seeing
people disappointed I don't like being
disappointed no one likes to feel
disappointment it's a weird sad feeling
and sometimes you do need to like sit
with it and just ruminate in it because
it will help you make better decisions
in the future and then you can grow also
loitering yourself helps you grow but I
think that there's a way to free
yourself of as much disappointment as
you can by having different expectations
for yourself and I think when I was like
22 years old I realized that I had been
living
my life like totally wrong like all
backwards I thought of everything I'm 22
I fucking know everything bitches night
down gently done they done it was so
liberating just waking up and living
your life that way I think that there is
a difference between goals and standards
and expectations I think that you can
set any amount of goals that you want as
high as you want and you can work hard
to achieve those goals I think that your
expectation of the outcome of that work
and whatever you're working towards
needs to be low or none whatsoever
I think that working hard towards your
goals while having no expectations of
what the outcome of that might be allows
you to live your life completely without
fear of failure it allows you to really
enjoy any successes that you do have
because you've already weighed in your
mind okay what's the other possible
outcome of this horrible am i okay with
that I mean fuck it yeah man why the
fuck not
take for example making new friends or
relationships I used to as a younger
person get really disappointed when my
friends didn't do things that I liked or
they hurt my feelings or something like
that
I like to imagine that making friends
and meeting people and starting new
relationships is a lot like being a
magpie right the bird that likes shiny
things
now this isn't it all huh Magpies work
but I like to imagine that they work
this way right so you're mad pine flying
around you're looking for some shiny
things Oh shiny things so you go down
there oh it's a bottle cap okay that's
cool I'm just gonna keep flying around
keep looking for shiny things Oh what
did I find
Oh Kim Kardashian's engagement ring it's
beautiful it's a diamond I really like
it sometimes I find crap I've just been
finding bags of potato chips for days
but does that mean that I can't find a
diamond no in the magpie I'll look for
more shiny things if the people that you
mean in your life are shiny things just
treat them all like shiny things then
you're going to use your little bird
hands and claws and your bird beak in
your bird brain and you're going to
figure out if they're a diamond or a
bottle cap and then you can decide which
ones you want to take into your nest you
don't need to be disappointed by people
if you have no expectations of them
cuz guess what when you meet someone you
don't even know them they could be a
bottle cap they could be the foil that
wrapped up a hot dog or they could be a
really cool diamond you don't know until
you use your little bird mouth and
figure out what it is Janet this makes
no sense I know the point I'm trying to
say though is that you don't need to be
disappointed by other people if you just
treat everybody the same people are
people and people are capable of
anything just watch like Ripley's
Believe It or Not people are capable of
so many things but you know just because
you know someone doesn't mean that they
can't turn around and do something
that's gonna hurt your feelings so just
knowing that that's a possibility in
your mind forever like if it happens ah
shit man I thought you were like a
sapphire but you're not your pizza box
I'm gonna kick you all my nest friends
change people change so if you keep your
expectations on the same level all the
time no matter who comes in and goes out
of your life everything's gonna be just
fucking fine man is the little unrelated
I feel like I know a lot of people
they're very hurt when they think that
other people are talking bad about them
I got fuckin news for you my friend okay
what do you think people do when you're
not around they talk about you it's what
people do all day every day forever
until the end of time how else are we
supposed to talk about you so bad things
not always bad things why are you
jumping to that conclusion plus isn't
that a Big Sean song funny thing about
talking about me behind my back is it
never gets back to me and it doesn't
bother me if that was doing something
that really bothered you you could
confront me and I'm all ears and more
than willing to listen to you that's how
it goes right nailed it yes and also
friends are like a box of chocolates if
you eat them they die another immediate
way I think people can use this is for
events or things in your life that you
have expectations for I think that
everybody has like that one or two
friends it's like way too into their own
birthday and those people are always the
most upset when everything doesn't go
the way that they want on their birthday
don't be that person just every birthday
that you have assumed that you're gonna
lay in a couch and watch Netflix
therefore everything that you do that's
better than that is really exciting and
great and you're grateful and you're
happy and everything's wonderful same
thing with your fucking wedding day
people that freak out on their wedding
day stop it's about love not about your
fucking cake and flowers so stop it
here's a concrete example of how to take
weight off of your chest and lower other
people's expectations of you stop
treating your Instagram or whatever
you're uploading pictures to like a
fucking photo shoot post some pictures
of you when you look natural ass even if
you look like you got hit by a bus look
at ugly bus like a real fucking ugly bus
every time someone takes picture of me
and they're like oh do you like it you
take another one like I literally don't
give a fuck because you know what moment
in time that's what I look like who the
hell cares
cuz then when anybody meets me they're
like I don't know what the fuck she's
gonna look like whatever you look like
doesn't matter you just look like you
they're not expecting to meet a certain
version of you they're just expecting to
meet you and talk to you honestly
there's nothing weird that when you meet
someone in person that looks nothing
like their pictures online why do you
even create that expectation for
yourself you can't live up to that
nobody can we wake up every morning the
fucking bikini on the full face of
makeup of heels and jewelry bitch boot
you do not make life just a little bit
easier on yourself and just keep it the
fuck real and the last thing that I want
to talk about that I feel like having
low expectations or no expectations we
should just do away with that we should
just call it like surprise life theory
your career and your life choices like
your actual path like where are you
going when you have certain expectations
for yourself I think that you limit your
choices and you limit what you can do in
your life what you've already set as
what you want out of it what you want
the outcome to be what you're expecting
to get at the end of whatever work you
do and I think that our generation my
generation is very entitled and that
they think just because you go to
college means that you can get a great
job when you graduate or just because
you work somewhere for five to ten years
means that you're going to get promoted
there's going to be some fucking ladder
for you to climb and I just don't think
that that's the case and I think that
people get stuck in their thinking and
they refuse to see all of the options
beside them because they're stuck in
their expectations of their life if I do
X I will get Y when in reality if you do
X you can get any other letter in the
alphabet including X again fuck if you
let go of everything that you expected
for your own life everything
happens is a surprise they're not always
good surprises but sometimes you find
yourself doing things that you didn't
even know existed you didn't even know
that you wanted because you were open to
the universe blowing you the fuck around
say for some reason you really want to
be a doctor when you were a little kid
and you spent your entire life doing
that but all along the way maybe your
mom had a sewing machine maybe if you
just fucking did it for a little while
let go of your expectation that you were
gonna be a fucking doctor you would have
been really cool at sewing you'd be
fucking Marc Jacobs or something be open
and not have this concrete path in your
life because they feel like you miss all
the opportunities to be a different
better you and another way that I think
that this is really powerful is that I
know that a lot of people have
complicated relationships with their
parents I think that everybody does at
some point your parents certainly might
have certain expectations of you I think
that that's important to be driven by
what your parents might want or what
your family members might want or what
other people might want for you what's
more important than that is to take
those two listen to them and then let
them the fuck go don't ever be what
someone else expects you to be if you
have a parent or someone in your life
that has an impossible expectation for
you they literally want you to be a
person that you're not something that
you're not if you let go of that one
person's expectation the rest of the
world is fucking easy I think that you
can apply having low or no expectations
to a lot of areas in your life that will
help you just have a more free mindset
and will make you less scare to fail and
will make when you do succeed at
something so you're more able to enjoy
it and if there's a way for you to just
shift your thinking like a little tiny
bit to help you be able to be more
resilient as a human being when weird
stuffs happening around you and I think
at the end of the day as long as you're
always working hard and applying
yourself the best that you can you know
you have no control over what happens in
the end all you have control over is
what you have control over if that makes
any sense only worry about the things
you can control everything else oh I
don't know it's gonna happen I know
sometimes if you live your life a
certain way but you haven't really
thought about it you ever really
verbalized it it can help hearing
someone else say it
loud and it makes sense to you and then
you can be more conscious of it so
hopefully for somebody yep their little
friend it helped you because it helps me
every single day every day I don't know
what the fuck's gonna happen today I
mean it's gonna be a good day it sounds
glass half-empty but it is so glass all
the way fall yeah see you guys next week
and thank you for letting me have a life
chat make sure you subscribe to my
channel I put out new videos every
Wednesday / Thursday you know now go out

have a puppy then you should go to a dog
park and find someone else's dog and ask
them if you can pet them and if they say
yes and you should hug them and not let
go and then maybe like run away and be
like sorry just kidding
