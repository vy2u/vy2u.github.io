I am okay at work comparisons and that
that game can suck it so without further
ado here is why this is like that models
are like blankets get off me you're too
hot private golf courses are like crepes

sweatshop I know it's wrong and that I
should do something about it but I'm
probably not going to right now small

neck pillow comfortable for a little
while and then violently uncomfortable
