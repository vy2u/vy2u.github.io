I don't know if you guys knew this video
and I am NOT filly them this is not a
sponsored video if nothing to do with
this it's called killer karaoke and we
were like in tears laughing at this
video people try to sing songs and
steve-o makes them do awful horrible
things while they're singing the woman
the lady is hysterical it's just
touching the teddy bear what is it but
the one we were like in tears last thing
about was this guy carrying a try
pretending to wait a table on steve-o
and he keeps getting shocked always
singing so these are little guns we sell
them in the store they're lighters but
the back part is a lighter if you pull
the trigger it zaps the fuck out of you
so we've sort of been like joking with
people because we live around the house
and people always zap themselves so we
were like you know what we should do is
that killer karaoke thing and we're
going to have one finger on the trigger
and we're going to have the other person
sort of pull it for you so that you get
zapped while you're singing they're not
like little Zach pulling little legs
it's like pretty painful like you do it
one time and never do it again and now
for some reason we've decided to subject
ourselves to this so that you can maybe
laugh a little bit because I like to
make you feel better
