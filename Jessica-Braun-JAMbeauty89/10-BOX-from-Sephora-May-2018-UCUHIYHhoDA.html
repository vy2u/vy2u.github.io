hand it's it want to wave so much today
we're gonna unbox the Sephora box um I
think it's for me they send it so late
and it's so hard to get these up in time
I'm like well can't you send it earlier
but it is what it is so this is not the
box you would get if you signed up today
it would be the next one's box which I
guess that's the case with most
subscriptions anyway regardless I unbox
this every it's slow down I am box this
every month because I love it it's ten
dollars the reason I personally love it
is because and no this isn't sponsored
or anything I pay for this for my own
money and I always left because I unbox
it and some people be like you got a
really good box because you're an
influencer I'm like I'm using my regular
Sephora count they have no idea who I am
has nothing to do so it really is just I
guess luck of the draw so it's not an
influencer box anything it's just it's
I'm a regular person in their eyes I
mean I am a regular person you guys but
I don't know what I'm talking reason I
love this is because everything you get
some of its new products which is just
exciting to get to try but also you know
you can find them at Sephora so if
you're like oh my gosh I love this for
example was it last month or two months
ago I tried the Peter Thomas Roth skin
to-die-for primer and fell in freakin
love with it so I'm excited I still
haven't bit the bullet but I need to buy
the full size it's already in my car I'm
just waiting for more thing I don't want
to place a million orders you know I
freaking love this stuff
and if you saw my sample size made me
buy a video I will link it below um this
is one that I'm like oh my gosh she's
like I got so I got it well okay I got a
compliment for my dad about my makeup
which is a really big deal and that's
why I was like sign me up I want the
whole thing it's such a good primer so
that's what I love about this I can
discover new products I'm like oh that's
actually really good and I haven't heard
many people talk about it so that's why
I buy it anyway alright let's go ahead
and dig in so they always give you a 50
Beauty and center points and then they
give you some info and the pricing and
things I haven't looked in here yet
okay so they always give a little pouch
to be honest I usually just give these
away unless it's like extremely cute
which frankly I don't think anything
really been that cute
I have heard a lot of you guys use these
for interesting things like you'll keep
feminine products than them under your
sink or keep perfume samples together or
keep just samples or travel size things
together so there are definitely good
uses for it but I usually just pass them
on to people that would use them because
I don't know I just I just don't end up
museum this one's okay it's a little
gene little denim thing let's dive in so
you always get five sample products and
then you get like one really small like
extra bonus sample sometimes it's just
like a little perfume sample or
something like that so the little
perfume sample is Khloe nomads Oh de
parfum let's see I'm gonna spray it on
this okay I always makes funny because I
spray perfumes right on me to try them
he's like what if you hated him like I
guess that was a risk I was willing to
take whoa okay it's very oh it's
actually nice I think the original Chloe
I didn't love I never owned it but I
remember smelling it just say the notes
let's see a fresh and feminine floral
she pray
it's CH y PR e it's a word I've never
heard the character of oak Moss
illuminated by radiant freesia and crisp
tangy Mirabelle well I was gonna say it
definitely smells floral but like sweet
floral it's a light floral I shouldn't
say crazy sweet cuz it's not like a
sweet I am a sweet perfume kind of a
person not crazy sweet but definitely
sweet and I think this might be it's
closer to what I like but it's this is
not something I'd buy full-size I can
see a lot of people liking this though
and I could see someone wearing this and
me smelling and thinking oh they smell
nice does that make sense but it's not a
smell I need to smell like I think I'm
losing it you guys okay next up this is
the new hourglass this is the hourglass
veil mineral primer now I do have this
and I think I've decluttered it but then
they keep sending them to me so I'm like
another full-size so I keep passing it
on and donating them but this is a
little travel size now Wow sorry my
baby's kicking me in the ribs I do think
this is actually a really good primer
but it's not one I used every day and I
I've recommended it because I think it's
great and I think if you have oily skin
especially or you feel like your
foundation really moves around on your
face throughout the day this is a great
primer it is but it's just not one that
was really my cup of tea I didn't feel
like I needed that much but let me read
to you about it if you've never heard it
or it's been a while since I've talked
about this is the silky oil free primer
that reduces the look of redness pores
and lines so weightless primer makes
your makeup last has SPF 15 it reduces
redness smoothes your skin's texture
repels water so when when I used this I
would use it mostly just on my nasal
region basically just where I have pores
because that is where foundation moves
along on me now I actually might keep
this travel size because like I said I
did like the primer but I just didn't
feel like I needed to keep the full size
of my collection and just go bad but I
might keep this because I could totally
see myself traveling with this to have a
nice primer as we're sweating and doing
touristy things and going out I think
it'd be nice to have a really strong
primer so I think I'm gonna keep it and
just put it in my little travel drawer I
have in my closet there so next in here
is from Tarte it's their leading lashes
mascara this is a perfect go to mascara
that lifts scopes and lengthens lashes
sculpt slashes that's the first time
I've heard something described that way
nourishes defined your lashes it's
jet-black flake free leaves a glossy
Sheen as I look at the wand and I'll put
a picture the one because I don't want
to get air into this before I'm ready to
use it it looks like one of those kind
of rubbery bristle kind I don't
typically like that however I've been
proved wrong before because there was a
covergirl one it was like green and
purple I don't even know if they still
sell it and that one had a similar one
and I was actually I really liked that
so sometimes I'm wrong but I'll
definitely keep this and try it out the
tardis lash paint
know your thoughts is this like a holy
grail for you do you love it is it worth
the money cuz sometimes high-end
mascaras I'm like now the beauty about
deluxe mascaras is these lasts as long
as a full sized one does so it's like
you might as well both got the full size
because it'll go bad before you ever use
the full size up to at the same time so
that is actually kind of Awesome oh my
gosh okay another good brand Kat Von D
it's their tattoo liner this is like a
total cult classic I just said that
weird and I actually do like this it
wasn't as good as like in my opinion the
Stila stay all day is blacker now I have
heard that she was like gonna be
reformulating it was gonna be even more
black maybe this is the new version
maybe I that it's not even true I don't
know but it's in the shade trooper which
is the black the waterproof liquid
eyeliner with the superfine brush tip
that goes on smooth smudge proof skip
free it dries quickly
I liked it like I said I owned the full
size at one point but I never felt the
need to buy it again the seal ones
better but then also I'd love the NYX
epic ink one and that's like eight bucks
and it's so good it's what I'm wearing
today it's what I'm here every single
day of my life
it's so good so I will link that one
below too if you're just like you want
to save money but this is awesome to
come in this cuz I will definitely still
use it I mean and again that'll probably
last as long as the full-size one I
don't know maybe it'll run out of ink
cuz I guess it is a face but still
that's pretty awesome
another good brand Bumble and Bumble I'm
falling in love with it a lot of their
products and it's frustrating cuz it's
expensive and I've been buying them like
one by one I'll like add one to cart and
buy it like Jessica you've gotta stop is
an expensive habit but this is their
thickening volume hairspray so it says
it's a pre styler so you spray it onto
damp hair and then blow-drying style
that's funny I just bought a volumizing
hairspray from Aveda and now I wish I'd
waited so I could because I've been
using it and I think it's nice but I
don't use it enough I'm like why did I
buy this Jessica Oh why'd you buy this
but this would have been perfect cuz
it's plenty to try cuz you just kind of
spray it in your roots especially and
then as you're blow-drying and stuffing
like for me even if I air dry I did
notice a little more volume but I kind
of wish I would have waited and then I
didn't have to
twenty-something dollars on that
hindsight is twenty-twenty Jessica
regardless this is awesome and if it's
really good again it's a travel size too
but that's a great way to find out if
you like it
last thing in here is this Sephora
collection definition of detox okay it's
their mud mask that's purifying and
mattifying I might pass this on let me
read about it because I know I I just
don't need anything mattifying for my
skin my skin dry ish I don't need to be
mad but it says the clarify skin with
zinc and copper it uses minerals and mud
to absorb excess sebum which is the oil
which reduces the appearance of
blemishes without over-drying it it
leaves skin soft matte ultra clean and
it changes colors as it kind of dries
which that is fun I just know myself
I've got plenty of masks to use and I
would say anytime I have the time to do
a mask I'm not doing a mattifying one or
a clarifying one I'm usually doing a
hydrating one and age-defying one that
kind of thing that's just me and what my
skin needs so I'm gonna pass this on to
a sister that I think would like it
which a my sisters has the most oily
skin that's what I'm thinking about
right now anyway but I think that's
awesome to get a great way to try it
make sure you like it and then if you do
we could buy full-size have I said that
enough okay Jessica that's enough
so that was everything in this month's
box I mentioned in this video that I did
that sample size made me buy it and I
think a lot of you guys have asked like
will you try them every month and then
update in the next Sephora play like
what did you like from last month induce
I love the idea behind that but I know
myself and that's not gonna happen
because there are certain things that I
you know if I'm in the middle of a
certain skincare regimen I don't want to
there are just certain things I can't
try every single month I don't know how
else to explain that so I don't want to
disappoint you guys and start that and
then fall off the wagon so my thought is
I think every few months what I might do
is do kind of that sample size made me
buy the full size thing where any of the
samples I got from this that I
absolutely loved and ended up buying I
would feature in that video every few
months and I'm like that's something I
can handle that I feel like it's
probably a better way to do it anyway
because most of the time I'll say yeah I
tried it a few times and it was okay I'd
rather be able to tell you these
products were amazing so much that I
needed to buy the full size
so I hope you guys like that idea I'm
excited about I think that'll be really
cool and if you want to see my original
sample size maybe by video I will link
that below but if you want to see last
month's play box just to get an idea of
what to expect month to month if you
want to see maybe it's worth your money
maybe it's not I will link last month's
play box below and other than that I
hope you'll subscribe before you leave
and I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
