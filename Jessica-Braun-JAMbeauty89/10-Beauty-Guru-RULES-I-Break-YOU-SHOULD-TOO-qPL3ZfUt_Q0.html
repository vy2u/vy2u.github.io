can't saw some I think because I'm I've
been pumped to film this one in
particular for a while today I'm going
to talk about beauty guru rules that I
break then I don't follow and I don't
care
none of these are real rules obviously
this is all I'm being kind of facetious
and silly and goofy and you know say
whatever I want but this is my channel
when I can but I just thought this was
such a fun idea that I kind of thought
of and it's been my brainchild for a
month and I've been adding things to the
list as I think of them and I think I'm
ready to share them so these are the the
unspoken unwritten rules of being a
proper beauty guru that i 100% don't
follow and I don't plan on slowing and I
think this is so fun let's go ahead and
get into it
beauty guru rule number one your nails
better be this long and pointy and
perfect at all times I have never ever
had my nails pointy and long I can't do
it not like I'm a teacher and I can't
literally physically can't do my job
with that but that aside I can't open
makeup with long nails like I can't do
anything dishes they break like I can't
I can't
and frankly I don't want to spend the
money on that that's so much money and
so then I paint my nails but frankly
I've even gotten out of the habit of
that like they just they chip within a
day no matter what I use and so I'm like
why am I even doing this like I'm
constantly fixing them and anyway but
that is the first rule that I break and
I know a lot of you guys are like thank
you because I frankly don't have the
money to spend on that I would rather
spend it on other things than nails
every few weeks and of course I look at
those girls with the nails I'm like ah
sorry but I know it's just not me it's
not me and all my siblings would make
fun of me
beauty guru rule number two you had
better be wearing and extensions girl I
didn't even get that one out without
leaven everyone wears extensions why why
like when did that become a normal thing
now if you wear extensions girl do
whatever you want there I'm not saying
there's anything wrong with it but when
did it become like a rule that everyone
was supposed to do it I have long enough
hair it's not crazy thick but it's thick
enough when I want it to be and if it's
not will you guys are just gonna have to
deal with it the idea of having things
like under oh my gosh it would drive me
crazy Tyler couldn't like put his hands
through my hair with that I'm like no
I'm a real human and that's just not
gonna work in my real life so I'm not
gonna pretend like it works on camera if
other people have found a way and you do
it in your life and you're like you know
what it totally works for me good for
you girlfriend it doesn't work for me
and it's crazy that so many people have
jumped on that bandwagon
beauty guru rule number three where's
your glitter back trunk
those darn backdrops now if you are in a
space where you don't have like I'm very
lucky that I've always been able to have
something in my background that I think
looks kind of nice like I like a clean
feminine look behind me that's just the
way I roll and if you're in a space for
you'd like okay I have to film like in
my dining room and I don't want to see
that is understandable there are certain
times when it totally makes sense have a
backdrop so I'm not knocking backdrops
and frankly they can look so beautiful
but hasn't it kind of become like the
status quo that you're supposed to have
a glitter backdrop in your background or
else you're not a true beauty guru
because every time I watch it I'm like
oh my gosh here we go and I can't handle
it like it's so much for my eyes to take
in and I'm like I just like usually
can't get through a whole video and I
don't know maybe that's my own eyes my
own craziness like I can't focus with
all that glitter behind it
and so it just it makes me laugh then
it's become so normal when I'm like I
prefer watching people with like real
life in their background it's calming
it's peaceful and of course the backdrop
obviously is a very clean thing to have
behind you there's no clutter and you
can really focus on whatever they're
talking about but I kind of like a nice
calming background you know what I mean
am i alone in that I don't think that I
am
beauty guru rule no I can say that
beauty guru rule number four I already
forgot that woman beauty guru rule
number four you would better link every
article of clothing and jewelry you are
wearing here's the problem
oftentimes I break this rule all the
time for a few reasons
most of them are buying like crazy
expensive shirts from stores that you
can easily link the exact shirt below I
wear a lot of consignment store clothing
goodwill clothing thredUP clothing that
I can't necessarily link because I
bought it used for a secondhand so I'm
like sorry I like to save money and if I
like something I don't care if it was
gently used before so since much of my
closet is made up of that which i think
is just fun
I can't link it and I feel so about
people like where's your shirt from I'm
like like I can't thread up it's I can
tell you the brand but it's probably way
out of season if you will so you
wouldn't be able to find it anyway I'm
like I don't know like I am amazed that
people can do that that they can
remember exactly where the shirt was
from what it's called how to find it but
that's just not me because of where I
buy clothes now another thing is I buy a
lot of stuff from HauteLook and those
are usually like closeout deals that you
can't I can say it's from Haute look but
that doesn't mean you're gonna ever be
able to find it because sometimes it's a
flat pretty much all the time it's a
flash sale so it's gone in a few days
and by the time I get it in the mail and
I'm wearing it it's long gone so that is
kind of a rule I break I'm like I can't
really tell you what I'm wearing like I
can tell you the brand but that's about
as far as it can go and I feel that
that's a rule I kind of feel bad but at
the same time like I love shopping that
way and I love saving money and I don't
think there's anything wrong with that
so
beauty guru rule number five you should
be at an event every freaking week at
least once a week I have gone to two
total events I went on one trip to New
York without and one trip to LA to go to
like a two-face launch party that's it
that is enough they were absolutely fun
amazing experience is not that I'm never
gonna go on another brand event
something but I'm very choosy about it
a because I've job but B just because
I'm like I have met some amazing people
at these things and I've also met some
people that I was like man I'm really
disappointed you were someone I really
liked and I didn't really like you in
real life and then others I was like oh
my gosh they're amazing in real life
like top meeting Tati she was incredibly
sweet in real life so that was awesome
but then there are other youtubers I've
met that I'm like oh my gosh like that
I'm so disappointed I think I'd rather
be living in Oblivion you know what I
mean I don't know it's like really
pulling the curtain back and seeing
anyway but I've met some amazing I've
had some amazing experiences but these
beauty gurus that this is their main job
which eventually this might be my main
job but they're at events all the time
and I'm just not and they're snapping
all day Adam and you know just being
crazy and I'm like that's so cool great
for you that you want that for your life
but that's not my style of living like
it was fun going to them but I'm like I
couldn't do this I couldn't even do this
once a month I don't know how people do
that all the time like my head is
hurting thinking about it because it's
so much energy and for me like anxiety I
get anxiety I'm not great in social
situations if you've ever met me and I
was awkward that would be why because
I'm like I don't know like and I almost
didn't the weirdest way feel like I'm
out of my element at those things
because I'm like I'm just like a bumpkin
teacher from Indiana that loves makeup
I'm not a makeup artist I don't wear the
same kinds of makeup with giant lashes
that everyone else does and I think
because of that it does make me feel out
of my element and I think that's kind of
a weird feeling going into it and it's a
feeling I don't really like I don't like
feeling out of my element so I think
I'll still you know I could see myself
in the future with brands I really
like doing something with them or going
to an event but to do that every month
or week or whatever I don't know how
people do it kudos to you because I
don't have the energy or the designer
another beauty guru rule I break is I
don't buy entire collections of things
and film about them the day I get them
and do my first impressions for about a
million reasons first of all I can't
just run out to the store in the morning
something launches and get it because I
usually have to work also at the end of
the work day even if I did run out get
it to be able to film on weeknights is
so difficult because I've got to get
everything set up I've usually got a
touch up my face cuz it looks crazy
after a long day work I've got a muster
up the energy cuz I'm tired from working
out you know what I'm saying and so it's
one of those things that I wish I didn't
break that rule I wish I could do that
all the time that I can't I know myself
it would make me unhappy and the video
you would see it in the video that I'm
tired or not really wanting to film that
day and I would never want that to come
across I've done videos like that before
and I'm like you can tell like I would
have comments from you guys like you're
alright Jessica you don't seem like
yourself I'm like no I wasn't myself
because I didn't want to film but I felt
pressured to because it was a new line
and I wanted to get out there so I break
that rule but I break it and I don't do
like first impressions for I've
mentioned in another video where I'm
trying to be better about really trying
a product before I just tell you oh here
I'm trying it for the very first time I
love it you should go buy it like trying
it one time is not enough that can't be
enough for a good review there have been
plenty of products I've tried one time
that I'm like oh I love it
and then like I try it three more times
I'm like oh my gosh is it terrible I
can't believe I told people you know
what I'm saying
like you really our job is to make sure
we really know I've gotta stop talking
about this in like 4 videos I will shut
up but I break that rule and I think
parts of it it's good that I break that
rule but the other parts of it you know
I wish I could do more and if this ever
was my full-time job I would but in the
meantime it's difficult oh and another
part of that rule I'm making these up
but is you know buying a complete
collection if there's a lipstick line at
the drugstore and they're like 15 colors
I'll see you tubers buy all of them I'm
like I'm sorry I'm not gonna be that
person and that money I've got student
loans to pay off
we've got a house payment I can't buy 15
even drugstore price lip glosses like
I'll buy 3 to 4 colors that I think
we'll be able to I think that's enough
show you kind of a range of colors I can
talk about how it wears how it feels
that kind of stuff I don't need all the
colors if someone out there swatches
online you guys can find but that I just
think that's such a huge waste of money
and I know that those youtubers they
have the best intentions they're wanting
to give you a really thorough review and
that's awesome and that's why I mean
that's just a rule I break and I I don't
know that's just so much money and you
know they're not gonna use all this
colors it seems very wasteful and now
they've swatch them so they can't do
like a giveaway so they have to give
them to and usually you can't even give
it to a shelter so you're having to give
it to just people you know and I'm like
that's so wasteful so that's a tricky
one and I think that's gonna be kind of
controversial but it is what it is
beauty guru rule number is using a
filter I don't know what beauty gurus
use a filter and don't honestly I can't
tell the difference frankly I don't care
because odds are if they're using a
filter I probably am not subscribed to
their channel because they're probably
someone that annoys me anyway so
something so mean and negative I don't
mean this there are plenty of big
youtubers I love and watch I remember
once in a video someone said oh Jessica
uses a filter and I was like I'm gonna
be honest I don't even know what a
filter is is it somebody this is
ridiculous I really don't like is it
something you do in editing is it
something where your camera like I don't
know I think it's something you do like
in post and editing I don't know I have
you I don't even use Final Cut Pro I use
iMovie I don't know how to do anything
beyond what I do like and so the idea of
someone saying I use a filter I'm like
thank you you are complimenting my skin
ma'am but no I don't even know how to
use a filter but I know that it's out
there and that people do and that
companies do and I get it it's you know
like think about when you're on snapchat
and you put on that like really pretty
filter please we all look amazing I'm
like if only if only I look like this in
real life but to do that in a video
makes no sense because if I'm trying to
show you what a product looks like that
completely defeats the purpose because
it's completely making it obviously look
more perfect than it actually does so
like I said I don't know exactly who
uses filters who doesn't but the idea of
it is so ludicrous for what we do
because it completely defeats the
purpose so you will never see me use a
filter unless it's just purely on
snapchat or Instagram stories calm down
you're a rural number eight you must
snap all day long and if you don't you
better apologize for it because you
should've I snap in the mornings
sometimes not every morning and I never
apologize when I don't because I'm like
this is extra stuff I do for fun I like
sharing parts of my life with you
but there's a limit you know what I mean
like it's just like when I talk about my
teaching job there's a limit I don't
bring work home from there because I
need that separation from there it's the
same thing I will share so much of my
life with you guys I do we vlog over on
my husband Tyler's channel which I can
link below and we share so much of our
life here at home and when we travel
with you guys but there's still a limit
and so I don't snap all the time because
there are certain things that I think
should be private and that you know I
want to experience fun things but I
don't need to snap about it all the time
and so it cracks me up and I'll see you
tubers that I love but that'll snap or
like they won't stand for a few hours
and I'm so sorry I haven't been snapping
today I'm like you should not be
apologizing to us go live your life like
you need a life outside of us it
shouldn't just be centered on us so it's
a very unhealthy view that I own I pray
for some youtubers to like not get a
life that sounds so mean that's not what
I mean cuz I freakin love YouTube and I
watch it all the time but to feel
comfortable having a life outside of
YouTube you don't have to share
everything with us and you don't need to
apologize when you take a few hours or a
day off of snapchat good for you they'll
live your life well we'll still be here
we're not going anywhere does that make
sense I hope I'm making sense so I do
snap quite a bit but you know it's not
like in every few hours thing and a lot
of youtubers do it oh my girl we don't
need to know everything about your life
take a break
another I guess this is beauty guru rule
number eight ten nine I don't know is
dyeing your hair thou shalt dye your
hair and tell what color it is down in
the description box
I have never dyed my hair people find
that hard to believe in like I feel like
that's not hard to believe this is a
very bland boring shade of brown I just
never have and I just haven't had the
desire if nothing against it like all of
my sisters dye their hair my mom you
know what I mean like everyone in my
life does but I just never had the
desire and I'm like well if I don't
really want to change my color then why
do it like you know there's no point I
don't want to go lighter I don't I don't
need to go darker my eyebrows are
naturally so much lighter than my
natural hair and that's just the way I
am my mom is the same way
and so I'll fill them in the way I like
to because in real life I think it looks
nice but I'll get so many comments um
guys like you need to darken your
eyebrows and I've tried and it looks it
doesn't look good and so it's funny
because there's no fixing it like I feel
I feel like it looks fine but I know a
lot of people want it to be so much
darker to match this but I'm like I just
don't think it looks good any darker
than this is way too much it to me I
start to not look like myself and I
don't like that look I like to look like
myself so I guess that's kind of that so
that was kind of a double whammy of dark
dark eyebrows and of course dyeing your
hair that was a double whammy rule
you're welcome that I break your welcome
beauty guru rule number ten I think is
filming on my iPhone you are not
supposed to film any parts of your video
on your iPhone it had better be a DSLR
or something like that
well I do film on a DSLR and I still
don't love the quality all the time and
I'm like I should just get a cheaper
frickin camera those do better I feel
like and I don't know all the settings
both on well I film all of my close-ups
on my iPhone and I have like the iPhone
10 now but I had the iPhone 7 6 I don't
even know what it was and I've been
filming my close-ups on that and
sometimes you can tell but that way I
can do them at the same time as I'm
filming I can have that setup over here
on a little tripod and when I tell
people that I film parts of my videos on
my iPhone pew like what why I'm like
because the iPhone camera is amazing
it's ridiculously amazing especially now
so I don't feel bad about that but I
know it's like totally like people like
oh my gosh II can't believe it or like
we vlog when we bought it is all on my
iPhone I'm not lugging around a freaking
DSLR and getting the bulk it's just
right I'm like no I need something
automatic and quick and small and so
anyway that's like a rule that is kind
of a silly one but that's just what I do
so hopefully you enjoyed this video
obviously like I said it's silly goofy
I'm making these rules up none of them
or anywhere but it's just something I
kind of noticed as a trend and I think
there's a fresh crop of youtubers coming
up that are totally a breath of fresh
air and I've totally decluttered my
subscription playlist and I'm watching
so many new people and it's so amazing
because I realized subscriber count'
does not matter quality videos can be
found at any subscriber count' and you
just need to find those people that you
connect with that you feel like are
speaking the same language as you I mean
like soul wise not like literally
although that's helpful too and that's
what I've been doing and I feel so good
I feel like Rhian spired like this is a
renaissance for my channel and I hope
you guys are too I hope you're starting
to notice that difference on YouTube the
reality is once you declutter the people
you're annoyed with it instantly feels
like a fresh new space and I think
that's pretty cool that you yourself
have the power
so if you enjoyed it definitely give a
thumbs up
I tagged everyone to do this I would
love to watch more of these you know
what are the beauty guru rules in your
opinion and do you break them do you
follow them or if you're not a youtuber
which I'm sure most of you or not what
are the rules that drive you crazy what
are other rules that I miss I think
that'll be so fun to read down in the
comments so I hope you enjoyed and I
hope you'll subscribe and I'll see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
