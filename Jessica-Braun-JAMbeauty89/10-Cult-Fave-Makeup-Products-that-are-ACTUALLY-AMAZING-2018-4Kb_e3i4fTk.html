share with you ten cult favorite
products in the beauty community whether
it's YouTube and magazines from you know
blogs and makeup artists ten cult
favorites that I think actually
genuinely deserve that cult status so
these are products I've loved for I
think mostly have love for quite a long
time and it was so fun going through my
collection and finding these because I
was like man like people talk about
these a lot and they're totally worth
that hype so let's go ahead and get into
it already under breath okay just love
yourself down yes hooha right first
favorite cult favorite I have a few
drugstore ones in here - this is the
l'oreal infallible shadow it's in the
shade amber rush really the the cult
status the hype is behind all of these
but this shade in particular is a very
popular one this I've been wearing tons
just all over the lid and then blend it
up into the crease I'm not wearing it
today but it's just this gorgeous bronze
shade and oh my goodness when you put it
on your eyes it just catches the light
so beautifully what's great about these
is they are technically like a pigment
and it's just kind of pressed down into
it so the more you use it because I
always use it with my fingers it kind of
tamps it down but it never affects the
quality of it I feel like I've had this
for probably far too long I know I have
replaced it at least once so it's not
like this is my original one but I feel
like I'm never gonna run out of it and
this is my favorite shade so it stays on
all day
absolutely gorgeous shades there's tons
of shades to choose from so if you're
not a big fan of a bronzey look they
have one I think they still sell called
iced latté which was a favorite of mine
for a very long time I still like it I
just don't currently have it love these
totally worth by next product that is
worth its hype status its cult status is
the NARS audacious lipsticks are the
NARS audacious lipsticks this one that I
currently own is in the shade Raquel
which is just a really pretty nude here
I'll put it on my lips right now because
I just have like a gloss on that I was
trying for another video
these are the creamiest lip products
and there's so many shades to choose
from and they hold on so super creamy
now I've got it on now that I stopped
talking long enough to actually put it
on so creamy very I want to say
long-wearing in the way that it's
comfortable as you wear it but you do
have to reapply it's still a normal kind
of satin lipstick it's not a matte
doesn't dry down which is what I prefer
now I also love my Marc Jacobs love my
I'm pointing back there cuz they're
right back here my little babies
I do love my Marc Jacobs Lamarck lip
creams these might actually be creamier
like it doesn't pull as much on your
lips as you're applying it I love both
of them though so much so anyway this is
one that I used to have another shade
and I don't know what happened to it I
feel like I left it in a hotel room or
something so I want to get more shades
in this because the more I use other
lipsticks the more I realize you know
what this really is one of the best
lipstick formulas I've ever tried so if
you can find a shade that you love buy
one and it will be your favorite
lipstick in your collection it will be
your favorite another favorite that is a
favorite Oh mine is another drugstore
one this is from essence it's their pure
nude highlighter so many youtubers talk
about this I finally broke down and
bought it maybe a year ago oh my gosh
oh my gosh it is so beautiful it's it
has this gleam to it that it's hard to
capture in a swatch like really hard but
when you put it on your face I'll put it
on the tip of my nose I'll put it up
kind of even up on my brow bone it just
looks so beautiful
and somehow natural to the only thing
I've had that's come close to this is
one from Laura Mercier and it is you
know like triple the price if not
quadruple the price and this one's just
as good if not better so this is one
that it's worth the hype if you have not
bought this it's like I want to say
around five dollars if even that it's so
worth it if you can get it where you
live another cult favor for a good
reason is from Mac it's their Pro
Longwear concealer I recently repurchase
this because I hadn't had it in a while
I loved this for so long and I love that
it's got a pump the only thing about the
poem that drives me crazy it's hard to
control how much you get out and I know
a lot of you guys have talked about that
too like I love that I was a pump
same time I hate it cuz it's hard to
control and I totally agree with you and
it's very rare I feel like for a
concealer to have a pump it's very
interesting packaging but this stuff is
so creamy and almost liquidy and you can
just I mean you could cover your whole
face with this you can mix this with a
moisturizer and make a freakin
foundation with it it's got such nice
coverage yet it's so lightweight and
thin and if you have dry skin like me it
does not emphasize dryness and that is
huge huge huge to me and very hard to
find I'm I'm realizing so I love this
stuff there's a reason makeup artists
love it as well holy moly if you're
curious I have the shade NW 15 while
we're on the Mac train is a lakh Mac
last Mac product I'll mention today is
the Mac prep and prime fix plus I'm
struggling today this is my travel size
I need to buy a full size I've been
using their charged water but I realized
that that particular one I have is now
like discontinued I'm like No so but I
love the fix plus just as it is it does
this magical thing where when you put on
a loose powder or even a powder
foundation and you spray this on top of
it it just like seamlessly melts the
powder into your foundation or into your
skin it's the wildest thing and it's one
of those things that if you've never
used it you'd be amazed once you start
using it now if you've got crazy oily
skin I still think it would work fine
for you if you're using it on top of
like a very mattifying powder because it
doesn't make your skin look oily or
glowy by any means there's no glitter
nothing like that
it just helps everything blend together
and I do think it might because of that
reason help the longevity of your makeup
as well so totally worth the cult status
in my book another favorites from becca
their shimmering skin Perfector i have
it in the shade opal i would love to try
another shade of this because i do think
I'm used probably i don't know it's
about down to there as i kind of look
into it so i've used quite a bit of this
and I do think opal will work with my
skin but I think a lighter shade would
work better with my tone but what I do
is all squirt some of this onto my
and kind of blend it in and then take a
sponge grab a little bit and then just
tap it into the area and it looks so
beautiful so seamless it doesn't look
like a strip of highlight because you're
using with that sponge and you can kind
of use that to kind of blend that area
in a little bit better and it just stays
on all day it doesn't look powdery it
doesn't emphasize all of those you know
crow's feet and dry dry lines you know
what I mean any of that weird texture
you have here I've got it - it doesn't
emphasize it and I think it's because
it's cream base you know it's kind of
liquidy it doesn't dry down but it
doesn't like wipe off either so it just
sets really perfectly I guess and I just
love it and like I said I feel like I
would use it even more I actually I've
used this so much I've traveled with it
a lot the little lid is actually cracked
but definitely worth the cult status
gorgeous favorite we were talking about
loose powders this is very famous one
from Laura Mercier they're translucent
loose setting powder I've used this for
years this is probably the third one of
these I've owned and I own tons of loose
powders that are very good but there's
something about this one that when you
put it on a it definitely holds on to
the makeup this is one of those powders
that absolutely increases the wear time
of your foundation like a million fold
when I don't wear this especially on my
nose like I always have things break
apart on my nose foundation sometimes my
nose is so red I'll need concealer on it
too and if I set it with this it stays
perfect all day if I don't it doesn't I
mean it really is the difference between
I mean it's night and day and so I love
this stuff so much I can't recommend it
highly enough I've found drugstore
powders that are good they're close but
none of them are as good as this in the
reality is this is they last me forever
another cult favorite is the YSL Touche
claw blur primer I am incredibly picky
with primers because I have dry ish skin
I typically just like hydrating primers
I don't like pore filling wands I don't
like really silicone evil what he wans
there are some that I do like and I do
use but they're certainly not my
favorite but this one is a very velvety
feel kind of a primer it's got a nice
it's really pricey it's so good so it's
like a gel and it just makes your skin
feel like a baby's bottom and it holds
on to foundation so beautifully
especially for me on my nose so if
you've tried a lot of those like thinner
more like pan kinds of primers that are
very velvety and you just get a little
bit on your nose if you've noticed those
don't work as well for you it might be
worth trying one like this it has the
only gripe I have with it it has these
tiny tiny gold flakes I don't know if
it's real gold or not frankly I don't
really care but I do know that they
don't really show up on your skin I just
don't really know why it's in there
regardless it doesn't really affect it
for me either way so don't let that turn
you off if you see that because I'm like
the queen of I don't like glitter all
over my face and yet I still really love
this so don't let that be a turn-off for
you if you're thinking about trying it
alright the next one is from Too Faced
this is their original chocolate bar
palette this is what started it all for
their palettes because then came to
semi-sweet and the peach one and then a
million million others and they had
other palettes before this that were
really famous but this was kind of their
first hit that was in this kind of a
shape packaging does that make sense
and so many people swear by it I do too
and it's one that when you look at it
it's got everything you need for a
neutral look but then it also has a
couple of pops of different things that
can really change your look up the
shimmers in this are freaking gorgeous
the mattes blend so beautifully I
traveled with this so much because we do
travel a lot and every I never miss any
of my other palettes because this has
everything I need it really does so it
does smell like chocolates so if you're
turned off by that or turned on my you
know it that is definitely something and
as I've said before it tastes like
chocolate too so those are my 10 cult
favorite favorites of mine that are cold
fish anyway that made no sense but I
hope you enjoyed if you did I hope
you'll subscribe and give this video a
thumbs up and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
