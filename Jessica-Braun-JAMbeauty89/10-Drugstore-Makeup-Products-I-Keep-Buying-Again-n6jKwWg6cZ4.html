going to share with you top my slow down
I'm gonna share my 10 favorites from the
drugstore that I have repurchased so
these are all products I've bought at
least more than once which is a big deal
in my world my own crazy world because I
obviously try out a lot of makeup so for
me to actually use something up and want
to buy it again that's like a double
whammy that's a big deal to me and I
love that these are all affordable
obviously because why why would you not
try to save money if good products are
out there duh
anyway alright so let's just go ahead
and get into it I'm already being weird
there's no helping any of us okay I am
wearing every single product on my face
and I have filmed me putting whatever
product on so while I'm talking about it
today I will show you each product being
applied so you'll get to see what it
looks like when it's being put on so I
feel like pretty content with the look
that I came up with today I mean it's a
pretty standard look for me but um and
it's I think it's awesome there are some
other products I of course have on my
face cuz I'm not covering everything but
see there we go I'm just like going on
the no I'm not even talk about anything
alright let's just get started
let's start with the foundation that I
have repurchased and actually you guys
have also sent me its the Rimmel lasting
finish foundation now trouble with this
is depending on where you live it's
really hard to find /they maybe have
discontinued it in the in the states I
don't know in Canada they have a pump
which is this is one that one of you
guys sent me but I have repurchased this
myself maybe three times I just really
like this foundation now it's not a
perfect match for me I mean it's pretty
darn close this is the shade 100 ivory
but it's such a great foundation it's
high coverage in my opinion it's not
okay I should say it's medium coverage
because I know some people are like no
girl I need even more than that it
really is medium coverage but you can
build it on top of itself it's what I'm
wearing today and while I do feel like
yes when you look at it can I tell
Foundation yes but does it look gross
and creepy and cracki
no and I don't think this is an overly
hydrating foundation by any means so I
always use a hydrating primer with it
sometimes I'll even put a primer oil
under it but I don't feel like I mean I
feel like it still looks good either way
it's just with my dry skin I think it
performs better with that added layer of
moisture I just really like it it's
really inexpensive I hope you can find
it I'll try to link it somewhere that
you can maybe buy it online I mean a
good place to always look is like Amazon
but I really like this stuff let's talk
about what's on my lips this is usually
when I talk about last but this is
something that I've repurchased in this
exact shade as well and it's what I'm
wearing on my lips today this is the
next mega shine lip gloss and beige
again this is another product that
people are like I don't know if they're
still selling but you can find it online
so I will link it it's inexpensive under
$10 might even be around five six
dollars this shade is the prettiest pink
I feel like it's flattering I don't go
for a lot of bright pinks that's not
true but I don't wear it that often
I do like bright pink like sometimes
I'll wear in a video see that makes me
feel like wearing like a bright pink
lipstick but regardless that's not what
I'm wearing every single day like to
work this is so feminine and flirty and
I feel like it makes my lips look
healthy and hydrated but I didn't use
any lip liner I didn't use any lipstick
I mean it's literally just this plus
there's something so beautiful of the
simplicity of just wearing a gloss I
think a lot of us love makeup so much
that we get into that habit of oh if I'm
gonna do my lips I need to do lipliner
and lipstick and maybe a little class in
the center and then rate and the reality
is it is kind of nice to just scale it
back and put on a lip gloss and then
look at it and think wow actually this
looks really nice in fact it might look
better than when I do all of those other
steps so just something to think about I
am just really going through like a lip
gloss Renaissance I know a lot of people
are who was Emily Noelle that did a
video I think it was literally called
like lip gloss Renaissance and she was
talking about that and I just I adore
her and I think that was so genius cuz
it's so true we're all like my lips are
tired of being
I'm like smiling coz these are all so
good I don't know what to talk about
next let's talk about the L'Oreal true
magic Lumi cushion i just repurchased
this so i thought about not mentioning
it and then I thought but I really
really liked it the one I had I
basically run out of I think it was kind
of on the verge of like it was pretty
much run out and I was like and I think
I just had it for a little while so I
went quite a while without having it at
all and recently I saw it at the store
and I was like I really missed that
stuff here's how I use this sometimes
like if I'm just bumming around the
house but I want to still have my makeup
done ish I'll just grab this I really
don't use any more the thing it comes
with there's nothing wrong with it it
still applies it really well so if
that's what you have girl use it because
it does work I used it for a long time
but first of all can we talk about the
packaging this looks like Charlotte
Tilbury like beautiful packaging I
freaking love that so that's part of it
but I realized I genuinely love the
product but I just use a wet sponge this
is my favorite L'Oreal one Laurelton
anyway and I'll just dip it in there and
you can see me applying it on my face
I'll use it on my nose to cover some
additional redness not necessarily when
I'm first getting ready in the morning
cuz usually the foundation does the
trick but I'll still throw it on there
if I get off of work or if it's just
midday and I'm like oh my nose is a
little bit red this is such a seamless
product to throw on top of that and this
would be a case that you know if this
were in my purse I would be using this
cuz I'm not gonna put a wet sponge in my
purse and carry it's not gonna happen
and that's just the way I am I know some
of you guys did you see me just spit
everywhere my poor students I Spit on
them all the time anyway it's an amazing
touch-up product it has decent coverage
probably light to medium but it's just
that perfect touch-up product that I
find myself like I said I was missing
this in my collection cuz I didn't
realize how much I'd used it so I really
like it I've tried a lot of cushion
foundations I'd also like the Linda's
Christian Foundation was really really
nice of course it's pricier than this
there's another one I really really
liked I don't remember
but this is my favorite favorite
favorite cushion from the drugstore the
whoa the wet and wild one is also really
good so if that you know that one's
definitely cheaper that one's really
nice as well you can use them both in
the same way I just seem to prefer the
Loreal one just a little bit more but
they're both really nice so my hair
don't you hate when you
I just blow-dried my hair straight
that's what I was called and then I
learned that's really kind of a blowout
on my Oh like I just called it I blow
drying it straight anyway do you hate
when you do it you okay it's like
looking pretty good and then you like
turn you're like huh and it's like all
like wavy and kinky and weird spots near
like means are not real huge problems
next product is the Physicians Formula
youthful wear powder
I've repurchased both kinds more than
once so this is their matte version they
also have the illuminating version I
really like both I have been reaching
for the matte one a little bit more
often actually and I think by
eliminating one I might have gotten rid
of that and kept this in my brutal
declutter it's coming don't worry my
powder one I kept this one because I
have realized over the years that I do
like the illuminating one but when I'm
comparing that one to my like it
cosmetics one that I love the it
cosmetics one is better and it doesn't
have quite as much glimmer to it
so I ended up I end up using the matte
one more often so this provides it's a
powder foundation provides a little bit
of coverage they say it's translucent I
don't know I could see this looking ashy
on someone you know what I mean and I
don't think they really have shades so
that's all I'm gonna say about it
because I really really like it but
Physicians Formula there I hope they're
working on their shade game I know like
with their new foundation they're
they're expanding more and more but they
need to do the same with their powders
but I really like the formula also guys
you've got to stop telling me that I
look pregnant because every time you
guys say that I'm like how fat is my
face and then a lot of used to be like
no you're just glowy I'm like okay
because some of you guys are like no
like I can just tell you're pregnant
like you can tell
don't say that that makes you feel like
my face is so fat it probably is don't
don't say in the comment
just let me live the lie in my head that
I look just the same as I did before the
next product that I have repurchases
from ELF this is their blush in mellow
MA
this is like three bucks I'm wearing it
today there's something about the color
of this freaking blush it's like it
appears like it's like a kind of berry
tone but like a with a slight bit of
peach but there's this like shift to it
that's like a cool blue tone shift that
I can't explain you just have to see it
on your skin and what's cool about it is
it's not shimmer at all but it's just
this shift to it I can't I've never
tried a blush like this ever and all of
the blushes I've tried and it's it's
this shade so out of all the elf blushes
I've tried this is the only one I've
kept and ivory purchased and I just if
you haven't tried it it's three bucks I
think it looks really nice and when you
put highlighter on with it I feel like
that blue shift just looks really nice
with the highlighter so it all just
plays really well together and these
lasts a surprising amount of time on
your face as well so no complaints with
the wear time either alright next
product is this eyebrow gel this is from
NYX it is their control freak eyebrow
gel this I applied today in my brows as
you can see and this is the perfect
amount of hold for your brows where you
know like when I'm touching my brows
once it's done and dry I can definitely
tell there's something in there but not
so much that they feel like crunchy it's
kind of like right in between where you
can definitely feel it's kind of like if
you hairspray your hair you can
definitely feel there's something on
there but if I needed to like start my
brows over and like comb through it I
could comb through it and it'd be out of
there pretty quickly whereas the
Anastacio brow gel which I also really
like that hasn't even stronger hold and
so if you need that you might I mean I
would say even still try this because I
do think this has pretty strong hold
but the anasazi wants just a little bit
stronger and I prefer this and I bought
this probably like four times I like it
next product is from Wet n Wild and this
was a reaiiy like sitting rule Oh
sorry guys this was a repurchase very
recently and it's their color icon
bronzer and reserve your Cabana remember
this uh it makes me think of like the
earliest days of my youtube channel like
it's I don't know like okay let me start
with why I love this I haven't even told
you why it's a bronzer but for pretty
much most people this is not gonna
bronze your skin I mean maybe the
fairest affair but it really is more of
like a glowy powder kind of a
highlighter well it has SPF in it and
that's why I've you know I feel like
I've never fully used one of these up
but I've had to repurchase it quite a
few times because you know SPF does go
bad in products and I don't like holding
on to it too long I don't know I'm just
weird about it I don't know why I am but
I guess I just am maybe they took the
SPF out I think they did they did so
that explains why it doesn't have the
smell oh my mind is blown right now so
they no longer have the SPF I'm
realizing and it doesn't have the same
smell now in all fairness it was a very
strong smell and I didn't really like it
but you kind of get used to it and now
I'm like oh I kind of miss that smell
because you just you know I don't know
the sound just sake but this and you
know what now that I'm saying that I've
learned it the past week and it's not
quite as glowy as it was I don't know
maybe it is but I like to apply this to
my face almost as if it's like a like
the hourglass ambient lighting powder
except for I've realized that stuff is
just a little bit dark for my skin and
so when I'll put that all over as like a
glowy powder so I look like lit from
within I feel like it is just a little
bit dark for my skin so it will kind of
darken the shade on my face not so much
that most people would notice but I
notice I don't like that so this is just
a little bit lighter and I don't think
it darkens now like I said I don't feel
like it's quite as glowy as it used to
be but this that honestly makes it even
better for just an all-over glowy powder
so make sense
I freaking love this stuff alright the
wet and wild single shadow in Brule it's
like literally a dollar this I just
bought a few months ago I've already hit
pan I
at every single day I will use it to
kind of set my eye primer it evens
everything out it's got surprising
amount of pigment and on top of that
I'll even put it on my inner corner and
it kind of sets the concealer there and
again it kind of corrects it's the
coolest freakin product I honestly
honestly wish they made this powder this
exact product in a larger compact so I
could use it for that reason but also it
would be the perfect powder to clean up
like under your contour or you know to
brighten this area in the center of your
nose as a matte highlight but I don't
want them to change anything I want it
to be the exact same ridiculously
powdery ridiculously pigmented product
but just in a larger pan wet and while
please please will you do that
I will pay 500 dollars for it honestly
I'd pay like $20
don't tell what well that though they
would never do that to us would they
this stuff has crazy kickback but it is
amazing yes when I'm out of this I will
of course buy it again for a whole two
dollars I travel with it like it is it's
the best if you've not tried it are you
freaking kidding me if you have not
tried it and you've heard me talking
about this for months and months and
months especially with the new
formulation that's even better go out
and buy it next product I've probably
brought like six of is my favorite
liquid liner of all time the NYX epic
ink liner I put it on today on top of
like my gel liner which I'm talking
about in a different video it is
drugstore though I'll just tell you real
fast secret this is the Maybelline
lasting drama matte lacquer and you like
squeeze it up I'm gonna be doing it in a
gimmicky products video but anyway so
you see me applying the liquid liner on
top of that because really I just mostly
use this to darken my line make it a
little bolder and also to do my mini
winged that I do every single day so I
love this stuff it's super black it
stays on all day I've realized that
liquid liner is so personal because like
the Kat Von D one was pretty good but I
think this one's better and it's the
exact same like brush and like the
physician's for me the eye booster one I
tried that years ago a couple of times
and I never really fell in love with it
so either
they reformulated it and that's why
everyone loves it today so maybe I
should retry that because I've heard
that's amazing this is even cheaper
though this is like $7.99 and I always
stock up like when they have actually if
you're going Knicks crazy you I would
say if they have like a buy one get one
50% off sale you should do the control
freak and the epic liner oh and the and
the lip gloss oh all right next is the
essence lash princess mascara
it's what I'm wearing today again around
five dollars this is just amazing so
many youtubers loved it the same way I
do it's just such an easy mascara to
give you instant volume the day you open
it you don't have to wait for it to dry
out it's not too wet it's not too dry
it's not too clumpy now that being said
you can still get clumps with this so
what I do is after I you know I'll just
do a bunch of teeny tiny coats you know
just the way I roll and then I'll just
brush through it with just like a bra a
lash comb and that'll instantly separate
them and then you're done and I feel
like it holds the curl really well I
have been asked so many times in person
when I'm wearing this what scare are you
wearing and I'm like girl it is like
five dollars and it is it the freakin
best so I said girl a lot I don't mean
just girl I mean girl boy anything I
don't know like why I'm in this like
habit today girl ok bonus product I just
had to mention cuz I mention it in
passing this is the L'Oreal sponge that
I freaking love now I also and I have
literally like five of these I have a
brand new one open in there I it's my
favorite I like you better than Beauty
Blender it's a bigger one and I freaking
love that because I can go boo boo boo
boo boo and my whole cheek is done
whereas with the Beauty Blender I'm like
takes forever I freaking love the
surface area of this and I just picked
up L'Oreal's
no nut contour concealer thing I've been
using this a lot it is like the perfect
size it is the same freakin thing I
can't believe I waited this long to try
it so bonus products I just wanted to
mention cuz they're really really good
so those were all of my drugstore
favorite products things that ivory
purchased over the years I probably have
more but I figured I'd kind of curate it
a little bit to my the best of the best
if
