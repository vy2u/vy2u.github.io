share with you ten drugstore products
that blew me away these are ten makeup
items that are drugstore price you can
find them on Ulta or you can find them
at your local drugstore and they just
really really performed better than I
expected
I saw Samantha March a youtuber I love
do this kind of a video I think she
titled it something maybe a little
different but I will link her channel on
her video below if you're interested in
seeing more of these kinds of products
otherwise I hope you'll subscribe to my
channel as well and I'll see you guys
just started to do my ending haven't
even started the video this is my life
now so let's go ahead an get into it I
don't you know what I was gonna say
let's just start the video okay I'm
embarrassed do you see I'm embarrassed
so one product that I'm wearing today
that really really blew me away was from
model zone it's their sculpting glow
cream to powder bronzer in golden glow
this is like they set a cream to powder
bronzer my I have two favorite ways of
applying this the way I applied it today
that you're seeing me now apply is with
a moist sponge just get some of the
bronzer on it and then just apply it to
those areas that you want bronzer to be
obviously and it just it stayed on
longer throughout the day than I would
have ever expected I've been using this
for a few months now it's really similar
to the really expensive
Chanel bronzer the tan Deschanel I love
this stuff they're a little bit
different but I mean I recently did a
dupes video and I didn't include them
but you really they're pretty close but
I think the Dior one stays on a little
bit longer throughout the day but I
still find myself reaching for this
because I feel like it lasts long enough
that it doesn't like look crazy or
anything have with you today and it's
just so darn inexpensive I think it's
great so I applied it here I planned it
a little bit up there and it just stays
nicely if you do set it with the powder
it's gonna stay for a long time often
times what I'm using a cream product I
just wanted to stay creamy and so I
don't always want to put powder on top
of it and that's just my preference
because I do have more dry skin I see
what shirt I'm wearing I'm wearing the
it's waltz from stitch fix and I did a
stitch fake
unboxing of a bunch of clothes and I was
trying on and this is one of the ones I
kept my green and white striped one I
really really like it I've worn it a lot
I'll link the video of the unboxing
below if you're just curious or if you
want to check stitch fix out I can't
even get that out by the breath by the
way I'm like seven months pregnant you
want to see the baby bump
she's my belly button is fully sticking
out anywho she's in there she's kicking
around anyway alright let's continue on
so another product that blew me away is
from Catrice this is their prime and
fine brightening eye primer it says it
intensifies any shadow and I was like
yeah we'll see you about that well it's
amazing I put it today just on this eye
to see what it looks like without it so
I have it on this side and I don't on
this I think they saw ended up looking
pretty even but I will tell you that by
the end of the day this side will be on
better because I do think that this has
helped improve the wear time of my
shadows I don't have big issues with
creasing and I don't know how well this
would work for someone that really has
issues with it because it is so kind of
almost oily in a way I don't know how to
explain it now it does stride down but I
I don't know how well it would work for
deep creasing but if you're kind of a
standard wear of eye primer I think you
will really really like this another one
that blew me out of the water is this
Katrice prime and fine beautifying
primer I've been using this for months
and months now it's a kind of pink tone
and it blends out to be translucent but
it has this kind of glow to it no
shimmer no glitter but it just makes
your skin glow in this way that it looks
healthy I can wear it every day and if
it's a sunny day it doesn't look weird
in the sunlight I'll look in the mirror
like in fluorescent lighting at school
and I'll think wow like my skin looks
nice and it's always some days I'm
wearing this so I feel like it really
does make a difference even though it's
gonna be under a foundation it really is
a nice canvas to make sure that your
skin is still alive and not just like
dull on that same vein if you want a
little bit more glow to your skin this
one is amazing
it's from Physicians Formula it's their
spot light illuminating primer
is just a little bit more literally
shimmery but or maybe I should say glowy
cuz there's not like glitter in this at
all but I'll put it all over my face and
again especially if I'm having an
especially dry skin day maybe it's the
middle of winter and I just feel like my
skin needs something to help it glow a
little more I'll put this all over and
then put my foundation or BB cream on
top and it just looks so so nice now if
you've got really oily skin I don't know
that you would like this all over your
face cuz I do think it's going to
illuminate that so it's something to be
aware of another favorite is oops I got
hold on I've got primer on it it is from
Ulta it's the Ulta full-coverage liquid
concealer this has become one of my
favorites it's got a doe foot applicator
but it's so creamy and it blends so well
and I was just so impressed because I
tried like an Ulta foundation I really
didn't like that so I thought all the
concealers gonna be all weird too no it
was amazing if you want to see my Ulta
brand best amours cuz I found a lot of
really good products on their brand and
a lot of props I didn't like I will link
that below because I know like they'll
have sales Ulta you know brand sales buy
one get one 50% off or buy two get one
free and if you don't know where to
start it's like well I don't even know
what's good cuz they have a whole wall
of makeup in their uLTA Beauty line so
I'll link that below if you're curious
but this was definitely one of my
favorites the next one this was a more
recent find for me it's from Catrice
I've got a lot this is like the third
Catrice item and it's the last one but
it's they're strobing blush these they
had sent to me and I they were just kind
of just sitting in my drawer and I tried
them recently in a like trying on new
makeup video and I was like what these
are actually really nice so I have three
shades i've got mrs. summer peach i've
got mrs. Rosalie berry and then mrs.
amber brown you can see the swatches
these I think they're called strobing
blushes because there is a little bit of
shimmer to them but not so much like let
me show you an example so like this is
from the brand stellar and it's a really
nice blush it is in the shade flare and
this is a very very shimmery shimmery
blush like there's a lot of gold glitter
in it and it's B
full but it definitely has like gold
glitter whereas these have this quality
to them that's like a satiny shimmer
where there's not super detectable
shimmers but they make your skin in your
cheeks just kind of glow and I love that
I still feel like I want to wear
highlighter with them like I don't feel
like it would replace that but I think
that's why I like them because often
times I won't grab a shimmery blush
because I'm like well no because then
I'm gonna be shimmery everywhere and I
don't want to put a highlighter but I
want to wear a highlighter today I know
there's someone out there that's like I
know what you mean cuz I have shimmery
blushes in my drawer and I feel like I
always overlook them because I'm like I
want to be able to wear a highlight
today so I'm gonna wear more of a matte
blush well this is kind of right in
between where I totally want to wear a
highlighter with them still and yet they
still have that really pretty glow oh my
gosh I love the most so so surprised by
how good those were alright moving on
covergirl this is their vitalist healthy
powder now good luck finding a shade
because their shade range is terrible
this is the shade 710 classic ivory and
you'll even see in the swatch it's a
little dark for me but I'll kind of
lightly dust it just with a powder brush
all over and it soaks with the oil it
definitely adds coverage and I think
that's why I like it it's a very silky
silky powder but it blends really nicely
now I will say this if you don't put a
setting spray on it to kind of help melt
it together I do think it tends to look
a little bit dry like many powders do
but for me I'll just throw a setting
spray on top of it it helps to kind of
melt it into the skin and that looks
really nice throughout the day so that's
how I found that I've fallen in love
with this by using it in conjunction now
they do have a covergirl setting spray
let me just grab it it's there look lock
up all day setting this these do work
really well together but of course you
could use this with any setting spray
you have I think this is nice but I
don't think it's there's a reason I'm
not mentioning in this video I don't
think it's like blowing anything else
out of the water but I really did like
this powder foundation another figure is
from wet &amp;amp; wild it's their mega cushion
I am very wishy-washy with cushion
foundations because sometimes I'll get
one and I'll try it and I'm like it just
like it won't sit on the skin right or
it just doesn't really cover enough but
this one I found a few that I
like like Laneige makes one I really
really like another one like even the
L'Oreal Lumi one I like well this one I
was like it's gonna be cheap it's not
gonna end up Lenny in his skin I have
been wrong
because when you apply it and I just use
this sponge you could use your own
sponge and I'll just apply it especially
here where I'll get redness or even on
my nose it will do such a good job of
really quickly touching that area up and
so I find that I don't necessarily use
this all over my face for just the whole
day I have and it's fine but I don't
think the longevity is good enough for
me to wear to work for the entire day
but I do absolutely love this for
touching up because I can just put it in
that area kind of blend it in and it
looks so nice it blends right in and it
covers the redness I'm wanting to cover
or the kind of hyperpigmentation
anything like that you might have so I
really really like this it's not a high
coverage product though I want to say
that but for me it's enough that it
really evens the area out and it looks
nice throughout the day another one and
I've done a whole separate video on
these these are the new Milani pallets
they're $20 apiece
a lot of you guys have found them at
Walmart for 15 so I would say drive to a
Walmart walk in and go get it I don't go
into Walmart often but had I known I
would have saved 5 bucks each I probably
would have not ordered them online and
actually gonna got them but they have
this bold obsessions palette which has
shimmer and matte and you can see in the
swatches the shimmers are freaking
gorgeous the mats are nice in this one
too however I do think that the matte
shadows in the most loved mats are
better
these blend a little bit better they
even swatch better now I love the look I
get with both of these palettes
sometimes I'll just mix the palettes
they're so you know really they're
travel friendly they're small there's a
giant mirror there's no excess packaging
for no reason you know they're so good
you guys now $20 / $15
it is creeping up outside of the
drugstore price range
I do feel but at the same time when the
quality is that of like a $50 eyeshadow
palette and they're only charging 15 or
20 I'm like okay it's worth it because I
would pay $40 and get a two-faced
palette that maybe I don't really like
that much and these are bad
these are so so good so don't write them
off just because they're drugstore
because these are incredible another one
is from essence and again this is a
newer one for me but it's their cushion
eyeliner think of this less like a gel
or cream liner and more as a liquid
liner because that's exactly what it is
it's literally a cushion filled with
liquid liner so if you have like a
favorite liner brush you can grab that
you literally dip it right in and then I
can create a wing with it I mean it's so
easy to control and yet it spreads
really easily too now if you're brand
new to like liquid liners or using like
liner brushes it might not be as easy
for you but if you're somewhat used to
it you're gonna love this because it
makes like instead of putting cream or
gel liner on which for me takes a little
bit of time and I'm used to doing it
every single day and then I put a liquid
liner on top to be able to do the wing
this takes care of both so I don't need
to use two products I can just use this
create the wing darken and thicken the
line and it stays on all day too so I
was blown away by this product and I
just think it's very inventive and I
know that I think there are other brands
that have cushion liners like this but
this is a cheap one and it's so so good
so those are all of the ten products
that kind of blew me away from the
drugstore I'd love to know what are some
of your favorite products in the
drugstore that maybe you originally
thought would be gimmicky or you didn't
think it would work or you didn't think
you'd like it
and you ended up loving it let me know
below I'd be very curious and I hope
that you will subscribe before you leave
and I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
