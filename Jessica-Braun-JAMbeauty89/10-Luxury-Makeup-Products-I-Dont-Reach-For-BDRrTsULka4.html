gonna share with you ten high-end
products that I feel like I never reach
for I just forget about and I'm I'm
hoping that making this video will like
remind me to use them more because for
the most part all of these are good
products it's just you know I'm always
trying new things out and so I feel like
they've gotten lost in my collection I
know that I saw a similar video Nikki
Murphy did she done makeup products I
don't use but can't get rid of and that
video cracked me up is a really long
video I will link her channel and that
video below but I love the idea of that
because we do like and this is not
exactly what I'm doing today it was so
similar I think we do do that we have
like you know products that either we
spend a lot of money on and you're like
oh I love looking at it I love swatching
it but you really don't ever use it and
at the same time you can't get rid of it
you know what I mean and I'm like the
declutter Queen I love getting rid of
things but there are some things I'm
like I just can't get rid of it
you know what I mean so I might think
about doing one that's very specifically
like that in the future if you'd be
interested let me know but these are
just ten products that they're in my
collection they're high-end and I just
feel like I never reach for I've
forgotten about them so if you enjoyed
this kind of a video definitely give it
a thumbs up and subscribe let's go and
get into it ah this is one I've had for
quite a while this is the NARS
translucent crystal light reflecting
setting powder I don't know why I never
use this it's a really finely milled
white powder you know it's translucent
but it's definitely in my opinion kind
of brightening so for a while I used it
on my under eye and it was okay there um
I think part of the reason whoa
messy well part of the reason is it's
messy I think part of the reason that I
never reach for it is because I don't
use loose powder every single day so I
already have a big collection of loose
powder I really don't use them all the
time and this isn't my absolute favorite
but it is nice and I spent the money so
I want to make sure I use this before it
gets weird and goes bad you know so
that's one that I I want to use in 2018
for sure another one is the Kat Von D
locket
setting spray there's this is a good
setting spray but I think it's even been
so long that like oh no the spray is
just fine I remember there was one
setting spray head and used in a while
now the nozzles all weird so I need to
like run it under hot water and see if I
can get it so it's not blocked anymore
but this sprayer is fine this is full
you guys I feel like I used it for a
couple weeks I really liked it and then
I moved on to something else and so it's
like literally all the way up to here
it's a great setting spray it holds on
to your makeup does the mister is really
nice and fine so I'm excited to remind
myself to use this because it is really
really good like I said another product
I forget about and this one's newer to
me is the YSL all ours primer I gotten
this for free on like octal II I think
quite a while ago and it's just sitting
in my primer drawer I think I used it
once or twice a month oh nice and then
that was the end of it it does have
sunscreen in it just SPF of 18 not a lot
it's you shake it but it's a little kind
of squeezy too it's kind of like a
off-white color super thin and there's
definitely like an alcohol a smile and I
don't I haven't really looked into the
ingredients on this but I know like the
why I saw all hours foundation has some
ingredients that has a lot of people
like and maybe it's not great for your
skin so I have to wonder about the
primer so if you know let me know below
I just need to look into it and I want
to say kind of subconsciously that's why
I hadn't been reaching for it because I
was like I don't know maybe this whole
all hours line is not very good for you
but yeah let me know if you know
anything about this I think I'm gonna
look into it as well and see if I want
to use it or not next thing is a cover
FX product it's their custom cover drops
I bought this because I kept you know
I'm decently fair-skinned and if I
bought a foundation that was too dark I
wanted to be able to lighten it so I
bought a lighter shade in the shade in
10 and it's just a dropper and the idea
is that you can either make your own
kind of a foundation type product by
mixing this with like a moisturizer and
giving it pigment giving it color or you
could lighten things darken things
depending on what color you got and so
I've used it a couple times and it is
awesome
you guys it is fantastic at doing
exactly what you need it to do it's just
that I forget I even own it
I literally forget so I'll have a you
know a drugstore foundation I'm like oh
it's too dark let me go buy another
shade that's lighter and then I just
keep the darker shade
could have just kept the darker shade
and lightened it duh so it's a wonderful
product I just need to remember that I
own it and then I need to use it cuz
it's literally like full I think I've
used it like two or three times I have
another coverfx one the custom enhancer
drops and these are in the shade
moonlight and you do have to shake it
well it's the same kind of a bottle and
I think I remember why I stopped using
this I think I'd used it like once or
twice and and maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm
thinking of something else
oh no this is fine there was one that
was similar to this maybe it was one i
swatched in a store and it had full-on
glitter in it and I'm like nope maybe it
wasn't even this brand it was like a
similar product but this is so pretty it
would look so pretty just on the
cheekbones maybe like if you take a
sponge and just tap it into that and tap
it in those areas it'd be so pretty it
look not natural but it would not look
powdery which I like so again this is
one that I just need to use like why am
I not using that it's gorgeous and I
like that it's a thinner formula because
some of the like liquid highlights I
have are very thick and I feel like it
makes it more difficult to apply the way
that I like to apply them sweatin all
right guys we're throwing the hair up
all right hair is up so another product
and this was sent to me from Guerlain
it's their birthday candle pearls it's
their meteorites and I remember the
first time I ever bought meteorites was
I think we were in Paris on her
honeymoon and I was like Tyler let's
just flirt well he wasn't gonna use it
anyway
umm and so the smell of these is it's
very it has a happy memory to me these
aren't the ones I bought these like I
said they sent to me I never use these
though I mean you can use it as kind of
like subtle highlight you know whoa that
wasn't subtle maybe that's how I should
use it holy cannoli
obviously you don't have to apply it
with that sponge I need to like buff
that out
holy moly um but um wow that's like more
than what I thought so maybe I should
give this another shot
but like the ones I'd originally have I
feel like they were a little dark for my
skin and so I just didn't really know
how to use them I was like to use them
as like a powder to use them as a
highlight but these now I'm seeing they
were
can like pack a punch I'm really
surprised so you could swirl your brush
in there that's the way I liked to apply
it but again they did such a good job
with the cute packaging and I feel like
I need to use it because it's so
expensive and so luxurious and
apparently a bottom highlight on that
same vein these girl on meteorites baby
glow touches they I think they might
have sent in the same package again this
was like a year ago
but there's golden glow and rosy glow
and I think well I know the reason I
didn't use it it's got like three colors
in it and it's like a stick and I just
wasn't sure how to use it so when you
blend it all together it's kind of a
blush tone you know and so I was like
alright I don't love like cream blushes
like this and then this one in golden
glow is a little bit more of like a no
see it's still kind of blush II it's
just more peach toned can you guys see
that so I don't know I feel like I need
to find a good way to apply these so if
you have any advice I don't like taking
it putting it directly on the face
because I feel like it just ends up
sticking and then it's harder to blend
so you know maybe I could take it and
like put it in those areas trying to see
if this works maybe maybe that worked um
so again I'm trying to figure out how to
best use those because I want to use
them up they're expensive they're nice
they have that same exact girl on smell
it's very strong very very strong again
I have a happy memory attached to it
which - I like it but I think if I
didn't I'd be like very put off by it
it's it's strong another product I
always forget about is this Christian
Dior lipstick I have it's their classic
matte in the shade 772 very very creamy
matte I think the reason I don't use it
isn't the formula I think that this
shade is just not my favorite it's it's
like almost red and almost pink and I
would rather it just be red or just be
pink it's kind of in-between I feel like
doesn't suit me very well and like the
couple times I've used that I'm like
yeah and so I wish I'd gotten a
different color but the formula is
beautiful so I'm like I feel like I
should still use it so I I want to try
to use it and see if I can get myself to
like it if I can't then I might
pass it on but I at least want to try
this year another one I never use is
this milk makeup holographic powder quad
what's funny is they'd sent this to me
and I was like mmm like I don't know I
don't think I like it and I kind of
swatch I'm like it's alright like you
know there's definitely some cool like I
don't really know what's holographic
what's not but just kind of a you know
cool shift to it I guess but it was
nothing that like for me and my everyday
life I felt that strongly about you know
what I mean but if you like this kind of
a thing boy you'd like it because they
are certainly pigmented but I just
wasn't drawn to it and what's funny is I
just recently saw that this is like on
sale at Sephora and their sales section
so I wonder if they're phasing it out I
wonder if milk was like and I didn't do
as well as we thought it is nice though
but I never ever reach for it so we'll
see if I reach for it if I don't I might
pass this one on as well and then this
TARDIS pro glow
I bought this 50% off on HauteLook and I
couldn't believe is 50% off I'm like oh
my gosh like this is an expensive
palette I can like HauteLook below cuz
Tarte is on there a lot and they'll have
their blushes on there and all kinds of
stuff but it's beautiful I really like
this I just forget about it you know oh
my gosh these some of these are just too
dark for me you know like they look
really nice on a different skin tone so
they're the four there and then they
have this sculpting like contour powder
which I really appreciate and then they
have this cream which I never ever use
it's a little too dark for me I could
probably maybe make it work that's the
cream and then there are the rest of
them but it really is a good palette
it's just it gets lost in my collection
you know so I really want to make an
effort to use this as well because I
probably have only used it like five or
six times it just really sad so those
were the 10 high-end products that I
feel like I've gotten lost in my
collection I'm excited to give them some
more love to kind of try them out this
year I know so many of you guys have
asked me like Jessica do a project pandu
and you know I gotta be honest I don't
think I can I don't think I have the not
like self-control but you know I've
always wanted to try so many products
and I want to be able to try them and
like really give them a good old college
and then review them for you guys and I
don't want to be forcing myself to use
products either that I don't like
there's too much makeup out there and
I'm only getting older and you know what
I mean like I don't know so that's just
my viewpoint and it's funny I know that
I personally could never do it but I
actually like watching project panning
videos so I'm like a really weird like I
can't I like watching them but I know
myself and I can't do it so that's my
own thing I'm like wow I bow to the
people that can because I don't know how
you do it let me know if you enjoyed
this video by giving a thumbs up and I
hope you'll subscribe to catch more and
I will see you guys in my next one
