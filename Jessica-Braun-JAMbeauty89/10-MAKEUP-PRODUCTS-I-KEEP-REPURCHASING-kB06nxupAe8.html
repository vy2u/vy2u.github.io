watched my videos you know that's
however I usually say hey guys it's
Jessica today and today anyway boy I've
already screwed it up hey guys Jessica
and today I'm gonna share with you guys
my most repurchased makeup I actually
had a lot of fun I was sitting here
earlier when I first heard my cup of
coffee it's like starting to get hot
I wish it's not he's get cold um and I
was just sitting there literally just
pulling out makeup from my drawers and
looking at it and thinking okay what
have I bought again and again and it was
kind of illuminating to see because when
I look at it okay I've got one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten ten
products and how many of these are
drugstore one two three four five six
six of the ten so I thought I'm like I
feel like that's a good balance and it
wasn't intentional ten is a nice round
number two um but it's kind of a cool
balance I have just a little bit more
drugstore than I do high-end which also
makes sense but it's also kind of
surprising that I repurchase these for
high-end products as much as I have
because they're more expensive but I
mean I think all of us are more apt to
repurchase something that's cheaper duh
I'm just excited to share all these
because these are like my freakin
favorites so if you enjoy this kind of a
video give it a thumbs up subscribe I
hope you click the little notification
bell so YouTube will let you know when I
upload a new video let's go ahead and
get into it I feel like I'm always
laughing at myself
can you guys laugh with me so I'm not
laughing at myself okay um how many of
these am i wearing on my eyes today one
two three four five six six of the ten
again not that well seven one of them's
a brush and I use the brush I don't know
does that count
I guess I can't wear a brush you could
let's start with the drugstore one how
about we do the drugstore ones first
time alone with high-end so we'll do the
six drugstore ones first first thing I
repurchased again and again is my little
wet while Brule single eyeshadow I run
out of it I buy it again I run out of it
i buy it again
this is my freakin beloved eyeshadow
like it's one eye shadow I can't live
without and I know it sounds funny and
if you've got a way deeper
skintone for me then me this wouldn't be
that way for you but if you're anywhere
near my skintone it's just a you know
kind of apricot colored shadow pretty
darn pigmented and I use it every single
day to kind of like I'll put a primer on
and then I'll powder this just all over
it because it kind of sets that but it
also makes sure that the next darker
shadow I'm putting on doesn't kind of
skip and get stuck in spots because this
has already kind of evened that out so
it's not super sticky in any one spot
does that make sense so it's like a
dollar ninety-nine now I dunno wet and
wild has recently come out with new ones
I've got to get my hands on this I did
see that it's like the shade is just
slightly different but I don't think
it's gonna be different enough that it's
gonna like completely ruin it for me so
I am interested to try the new one if
you've tried it let me know I think it
might be a tinge bit darker but it's
like very slight so either way I'll keep
buying it but it's amazing if you
haven't tried it I know it sounds dumb
like this $1.99 shadow but it really is
that good I also use this like to help
blend and I use it today I'll put it on
my brow bone I'll use it to help blend
darker shadows together so it doesn't
look muddy or weird it does an amazing
job it has just the right amount of
pigment to do the job well next one is
this L'Oreal infallible little lacquer
liner it's in blackest black it's their
gel liner it's one of my absolute
favorites now I did recently fall in
love with the NYX nope
with the Ulta gel liner which I will
also link below it might be cheaper they
might be right around the same price and
of course you can use coupons and sales
for both of them so but this one I've
bought so many times I don't even know I
mean I've been using it for years and
years and years it comes when you get it
with I think it comes with a little
brush it's actually pretty decent I just
use a different brush I'm almost I'm
almost to hitting the bottom on this one
so I'll be buying a new one I liked it
as a gold lid that's part of it which
you know whatever but it's just insanely
black creamy enough but not too creamy
sometimes if it's too creamy it can just
slide all around this is just the right
amount so you can kind of you can move
it but it doesn't move
- easily I love this stuff this is how I
get the black black line on my upper
lash line
it covers glitter like I have a little
bit of like color pop glitter on my lid
if you will it covers that better than
you know pencil liners and liquid liners
you like way better so I just adore it
it's around 10 ish dollars depending on
where you get it and I can't recommend
it highly enough
next drugstore thing eyes repurchased I
think I have bought this particular
brush four times it's insane it's the
elf crease brush simple simple as that
it is a smaller crease brush so I'll use
like a big old fluffy one to go for her
to like get you know like a light brown
or gray or tan color just all over the
crease but when I want to do it a little
bit more detail this is the brush I have
not found a better one I really have not
it completely changed the game for me I
felt like I had so much more control
even when I didn't know what I was doing
which is like now it makes you feel like
you know what you're doing because you
can get powder on the end you know
whatever color and really get it in
there without accidentally going oops
and then you got like you know dark
brown all the way up here it's so easy
to control it's so good I've bought four
because I like having two so I can have
one in my bathroom one in here depending
on where I'm getting ready it's almost
always in here I love just sitting down
and having a you tube but sometimes if
I'm in a hurry I get ready in my
bathroom um but and then the other two I
think I had for like a year or two and I
was like I should probably you know I've
cleaned it enough but I should probably
go so really really inexpensive I'll
link this below I'll link everything
below but amazing amazing brush next
favorite I'm only gonna touch on for a
minute is the L'Oreal lash paradise I
know so many of you guys if you don't
like this you're probably like oh my
gosh fast forward so I'll talk about it
quickly this is a very like polarizing
product some people absolutely love us
some people absolutely hate it and don't
get it and I don't know why that is I
will say one drawback is that it dries
out quickly and it's already a dryer
formula now I was mentioning another
video a film today that today I'm
wearing this I wear it every frickin day
I already I've had an open for a month
and a half I already need to replace it
because I'm getting a ton of like
fallout it's amazing for one month after
that you have to replace it so it's like
you kind of got a grapple with like do
you love it
to buy it every month because yeah I
could keep this bad boy going I know
I've heard a lot of people try like you
know kind of contact solution saline
solution whatever to kind of revive it I
I will maybe I should try that before
cuz I haven't tried that yet to kind of
revive it make it less dry it's just so
amazing as it is that to me I'm like I
will pay $5.99 over and over again or
like when there's a sale or coupon I'll
buy to like buy one get one half off or
four I have a lot on back up I'm crazy
about this mascara it's so good but then
you think well if I'm spending you know
five to eight dollars on this every
freaking month
why not just buy one high-end mascara
for three or four months well I like
this better than any high-end mascara
tried so to me I'm like it's not even
worth it but if you do like one better
than your right that might be more what
you're ready so you really have to think
about it but if you haven't tried it you
have to at least try it once see if
you're one of the people that loves it
or hates it it's just very cool right so
anyway I didn't tell you I like it it's
very volumizing like instantly it holds
the curl all day hello alright next
drugstore product is from NYX it's their
NYX control-freak brow gel this is
probably the fourth or fifth one I go
into this this one's actually a new one
um I don't use brow gel everyday in fact
I've really gotten out of the habit of
it and so when I saw this I thought
should I mention it because I haven't
used it in months I haven't used brown
gel at all I've gotten better about
grooming my brows someone asked ODE have
you gotten your brows um thread it or
not threaded but like microphone I'm
like no I've never done it um I've just
gotten better about you know literally
cutting my brows like I feel like it's
made my brows instantly look more
groomed it's also made it easier for me
to just fill them in really quickly with
a pencil because I'm not worried about
which way the hairs are going because
they're already cut to the exact length
I want them anyway boy that was a
tangent but the NYX control read brow
gel I love because it's perfect for
normal life it's not like the Anasazi
home which I've tried that like feels
like hairspray in your brows it's it's
more like flexible and so it does hold
your brow hairs in place if you've got
super unwell unruly brows I don't know
if this will be strong enough for you
but I think for most people it
really is exactly right where I don't
feel like you can feel like words like
it feels like a tear sprayed in place it
just holds them but it doesn't feel
crunchy it's perfect I really do like it
and it's you know definitely under ten
dollars I want to say it was like five
six seven ish
all right next drugstore product this is
kind of borderline it's kind of bridging
the gap between drugstore and high-end
I'm counting ass drug store cuz I buy it
at Target although there are other
brands of targets that are super sensors
so but it's the number seven radiant
glow concealer this stuff it's like the
YSL Touche clot stuff but bet genuinely
better I have like literally two of the
wise someones and I still reach for this
one I missed this stuff I even use it in
a while I have it in the shade number
ten it's so brightening and yet it
conceals now this is not a heavy-duty
concealer it's gonna cover major dark
circles puffy
no but it's one of those things that
when I wear it during the day especially
to work and I look in the mirror and I
know so many of you guys are like yes
you know when you go to the bathroom and
there's gross fluorescent lighting and
you look at the mirror like I just look
like garbage just like everything is
wrong but because no one looks good in
fluorescent light you can see like any
dry spot like peach fuzz like everything
that's wrong with you is 100%
illuminated in freaking fluorescent
lighting but this stuff still looks good
even in fluorescent light and I'm like
wow that must be really good stuff so I
just love it does it sing into fine
lines of course it does every concealer
this for me but it's just beautiful I
feel like it's youthful and kind of
glowy it's not like shimmer or anything
but it's just the most perfect concealer
I love it so much
I need to put this in my everyday makeup
let's move on to some high-end ones
shall we let's talk about what's on my
lips I've really gotten into okay this
is a repurchase three times however it's
not the same shade so I'm kind of
cheating but I wanted to mention it
anyway these are the Marc Jacobs Lamarck
lip creams and I know I've been talked
about these for years for good reason
they're my favorite lipstick of all time
now my original one was Oh Miley super
red and I know whom I like oh gee people
are like yay okay move on what else but
we know you talk about all the time
but what I'm wearing on my lips right
now is this shade infamous and what I've
really gotten into
just taking it I had a lip balm on and
just going like this and that's what I
did and I feel like sure that was weird
to watch I don't know and while I don't
think that's gonna work perfectly with
like a dark red like Oh Miley a color
like this I feel like it looks so much
more natural on my lips and it's more
comfortable because it's not like
perfectly aligned because it's a color
that doesn't necessarily need to be it's
a very like a natural lip color and for
whatever reason I've really gotten into
that with these kinds of colors another
color I like doing that with is Sonic
truth this formula for these is so
creamy and comfortable and moisturizing
and yet crazy pigmented it's
unbelievable and now it's not something
that you know obviously it's going to
transfer it's still a lipstick it's not
a matte liquid lipstick that dries down
because like I've said I'm tired of this
it's just the formula is amazing and I
just want to share that little it's not
even like a trip I didn't make it up but
it's just something I've been doing
lately that makes me feel like put
together but I don't necessarily feel
like I have to worry like if I go like
this it doesn't like get all over my
face do you know what I'm saying so it's
just an awesome thing I've been doing
and I just wanted to share it next thing
I'd repurchase let's talk about this one
is the Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre they
now sell some Mac products at Ulta and
their Paint Pots are available at least
last I checked this one is great if your
my skin tone they have other ones for
like darker skin tones too so just kind
of check it out and see if there is one
that would work for you they also do
painterly I've done a comparison of like
if you're near my skin tone which one
should you get I can lake that video
it's a little bit old but what I said in
it so rings true so I'll link that below
if you're like thinking about it you're
like well should I get soft ochre or
paint gently I like that
did I say that enough my goodness this
one is a little bit more yellow toned
but it ends up working really well and
it's just an amazing eye primer it's the
only eye primer I think I've purchased
more than once maybe the Milani when I
repurchase but this one I think I
purchased like three times it's so
simple in the mornings and I did use it
today where I'll just go dude to do it
and just kind of Pat it everywhere it
cancels out veining it holds on to
shadow it's perfect it's not overly
drying but it's not like too
youie where it's like almost hard like
the shout of six too much it's just
right it's like the Goldilocks it's just
right and I even though I know that you
know it can get gross after time and
that's why I've repurchased it sometimes
I didn't even use it all the way up I
just said uh I've been digging my finger
in that for a year I it's time to
replace it you know so that is something
if you're not a fan of that then you
probably like it but if you don't mind
it or you know you know well I'll just
have to replace it after a while I
absolutely love it in this is gonna
sound weird if you have a Paint Pot
smell it there's something about the
smell of it there's like no fragrance
but there's like this slight smell then
I just love and I can't describe it it's
like it reminds me of see now I'm like
not able to smell like something for my
challenge or something I don't know I'm
so weird alright next thing it cosmetics
CC cream this stuff every time I use it
and I mean every time I think why don't
I use this every single day why am I
even trying anything else out for my
skin and the look that I like my skin to
have this is it best thing I've ever
tried it's you know high-end it's
expensive I mean it's not like $80 or
$60 but it's still I want to see it's
like over 30 it is so good not only does
it has SPF a freaking 50 but it just is
the healthiest thing I've ever looked at
on my skin you know what I'm saying
it's so good it's so like dewy but not
too dewy and if it is you can just kind
of set it now I think if you have super
oily skin I think oily skin gals don't
love this that much because it does
still have that kind of glowy nature to
it now they have the illumination
version ooh stay far far away unless you
want like it's got like micro glitters
in it and it just looked crazy on my
face it really did it was too much this
is just right and it's got great
coverage it don't let the CC in the name
for you it's might as well be a freaking
foundation I mean that is how I view
this I don't view this as oh I'm I'm
doing my makeup light today No
this is like a regular or filming day I
will wear this it's amazing it actually
is a pump I wear at the shade light the
only downside is the shade range it's I
want to say they have five or six shades
and that's it so I tried fair and it was
too light and medium was definitely too
dark so light works pretty well for me I
could probably mix it with porcelain or
fair I think it's called maybe they have
porcelain too I think they might be
expanding their shade range I'm not sure
I'm ready I just made that up I think
it's just wishful thinking so the next
thing is from hourglass it's their one
point five millimeter eyeliner I finally
bit the bullet a few months ago and I
bought a 3-pack of these only because I
still not found a drugstore version that
is this tiny of an eyeliner that says
creamy as it is it's so creamy I can
tight line and be so particular with it
and it just glides right on like butter
now obviously there are drugstore
options that do glide on but they're not
this thin and the ones that are like I
know like there's the maple Maybelline
like has the super skinny one there's a
couple I've tried them all
none of them are anywhere near this
creamy and so then I'm like tugging and
I'm like poking my eyeball out and like
oh my gosh why am i doing fits so it's
so worth the money in my opinion I'm
dying to find a cheaper version that
really is a dupe and I just have it let
me know maybe there's one that I've
missed but I definitely this so I bought
this three pack but before that I think
I'd gone through maybe two or three
they're so good they're so expensive
well I think one of one is like maybe
eighteen or twenty dollars which is
still expensive so then when you buy the
three pack it's you know even worse so
those are my ten most repurchase makeup
products let me know what you're most
repurchase make a product is down below
I'm always just curious because if
someone's repurchasing something that
many times even more than once it's very
telling that darn like that must have
been a really good product they must
have it must have really worked for them
especially if it's a high-end product
you bought more than once cuz that's a
lot of money to spend again on something
you know what I mean so let me know down
below if you enjoyed this kind of video
definitely give it a thumbs up subscribe
if you haven't already and I'll see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
