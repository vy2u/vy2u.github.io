gonna share with you 10 products that if
I had to start all over again these are
the 10 I would start with so these are
10 makeup products I absolutely love
that frankly I use so much that I would
genuinely like want to use all of the
time and if I were to go to the store
half of this is drugstore half of it's a
little more like Sephora kind of
high-end if I were to go to the
drugstore than Sephora because I'm like
oh all of my makeup is gone these would
be the first ten products I pick up so I
thought I think one of you guys
recommended this and I thought that is a
fun idea so let's go and get into it
let's start with the drugstore or should
I go in order of my face I did apply all
of this today I'm wearing all of it so
let's go an order of my face and I'll
show you me applying it as I talked
about it so first thing I and this is
newer to me still but I am such a
freaking fan it I'm like I don't care
I'm mentioning it anyway I used this and
it looks like I've not used anything I
swear I use this all the time and no
it's not sponsored or anything like that
this is from pharmacy it's their skin do
and it's a setting spray
it's an essence it's a toner so it does
have a strong sprayer nozzle but it's
got natural ingredients it's doing
wonderful things for my skin and I feel
like I mentioned this before when I've
talked about this first of all the
packaging is beautiful but I feel like
skincare is something I don't do much
about when I'm getting ready in the
morning like I'll put on a moisturizer
I'll probably put on a serum sometimes
SPF yes but like beyond that I really
don't do a lot for my skin in the
morning so I probably should be doing
more so with that in mind this is
forcing me to use basically in essence
so this is the first thing that touches
my face in the morning before I get
ready I freaking love it so it takes
about a minute to kind of sink in so
that's the first product I would buy I'm
going to repurchase when I inevitably
run out this next product is so good so
you guys know I'm newly obsessed with
like beauty oils and this one kind of
blew all of them out of the water so
when I did my Beauty oil video this one
I don't even know if this was even out
yet but it's from Kevin O Quan and it's
their neo elixir weightless
beauty oil so you kind of well I shake
it up I think you're supposed to shake
it up I shake it up I use the dropper
now I've cracked my thing so every time
I do it it actually breaks so I don't
know they need to fix the cap if you
have this is your cap working is it
broken I'm so curious but anyway I put
this on I'll just kind of either drop it
on my face although you'll see in the
close-up I end up getting it everywhere
usually it's just easier to kind of put
on your fingers and then just press it
into your skin the reason this is my
favourite beauty oil beyond any of the
other ones is because it's in the name
it really is weightless it sinks in so
fast but you can see my skin it's
incredibly hydrating I mean like deeply
hydrating and so for that reason I'm
like oh man like I really really like
this stuff I find myself reaching for
this over my other primer oil that I
still have and it's so good it's so good
I just wish they would redo the lid
packaging because it's not working out
unless I just cracked it and it just
keeps getting worse I don't know the
next product I would go out and buy
again is this Misha Beauty BB cream
perfect cover BB cream they have a
horrible shade range I'm like dying for
them to fix this because the product
itself is so good I'm in the shade
number 23 I'm almost out I might try
number 21 next because as I was applying
it today you can always see that it's
very gray and almost dark but as you
blend it out it kind of just like melts
into your skin tone somehow I don't know
this stuff is crazy
it has a really high SPF 42 and it it
just covers everything I wanted to cover
and honestly I like a plant with my
fingers best now sometimes I'll take my
pink L'Oreal sponge and kind of tap over
it to just I don't know kind of even
things out you don't even need to but
you always have to wash your hands
afterwards obviously because you get it
on your fingers that girl's is me out
anyway like I don't like the idea and I
know you guys some of you guys gave me
the same way like after I put something
on with my fingers I might like wipe it
off a little bit but then if I go to
like touch let's say like a palette I'm
like Oh getting that foundation all over
the palette like it just grosses me out
so I always literally get up wash my
hands then come back and continue
this stuff is absolutely incredible and
honestly I was looking at all my
foundations and I felt so over long
because I'm like I and I've curated my
collection quite a bit but still I'm
like I can't pick just one I love so
many products but this is like my
everyday go-to favorite so I figured
that would be what I would buy again
next the concealer I'm using this is
from Bobbi Brown it's their corrector I
use the shade light bisque so you'd use
whatever shade I just get this on my
fingers and it gets rid of all my dark
circles just like that blends in quickly
you could use a brush or a sponge
whatever I used a brush today that's the
only concealer I have on I didn't even
like set my under-eye properly and I
still feel like it looks nice like it's
just such an easy concealer and again
when I looked at my concealers thinking
about this video I thought I loved so
many of them but this one both corrects
and brightens for me and it stays in
place pretty well now does it sink into
some fine lines a little bit like you
saw me just do that because I noticed a
little bit of it's sinking in but
nothing crazy and frankly it's worth it
because I feel like my skin my under eye
skin never looks like crepey when I'm
wearing this and I don't have to go all
the way out with it I just use it where
I genuinely need it and it looks so nice
that one I've already hit pan on them I
need to think about replacing soon too
so for my brows this is a newer
obsession I'm sold like I this will be
gone pretty darn soon buying it again I
might buy a couple it's newer so that's
the good news and I'm like please don't
discontinue it ever please please
it's the Maybelline total temptation
brow pencil what do they call their brow
definer I use the shade medium brown
it's got a kind of weird kite shape to
it which I don't really mind but I can
kind of go at it sideways and then turn
it to do my like little tail there and
then this bully is a little odd but I've
gotten used to it I mean it is kind of
weird I wish it were a different shape
but I've gotten so used to it that it
doesn't bother me anymore the product
itself is a really creamy brow pencil so
it is so easy to do your brows like it's
the quickest I've ever done my brows
every time I do it and it's gotten to
the point where I'm enjoying doing my
brows which is really
because I don't usually but with that
being said this is not a formula that's
gonna stick well if you're filling like
bald areas because it doesn't sit well
on skin alone it really does need the
hair to cling to so this is not gonna be
your cup of tea if you do have those
sparse areas that you're really mostly
just coloring on skin I don't think
you'll like this you might be do better
with like a brow pomade which I really
like the Anastasio one it's expensive
like $27 but frankly you will not go
through it quickly and it is absolutely
amazing but for me I like this better it
works better for me so what is that five
product so far that I would run out and
buy if all my makeup is gone
let's keep going the eye primer this is
my favorite it's from Ulta beauty it's
their matte eye primer and nude a closed
contender was my Mac soft ochre but I'm
reaching for this more often and I'm not
really sure why I think this blends on
quicker and again when I'm getting ready
for work early in the morning I'm just
I'm like come on we got to make this
process quick I'm enjoying it but I
don't have that much time to blend an
eye primer in it does a great job of
holding on to shadow like I feel like
the shadow I did today which I'll talk
about and show you what I did I feel
like it just everything blends so well
on top of it and it's not that that's
not true for all of the eye primers I've
tried so I really like this and it's
really inexpensive and then eyeshadow
this was hard but I'm going with my
violet Voss holy grail palette I was
tossing around like the soft glam
palette cuz I loved that but I'm like
you know what I've had this longer and
it has more options and they're around
the same price I think this one gosh
they might be right around the same
price from Sephora but I chose this one
because I was like you know I can do
more with this and if I genuinely needed
to buy a new a palette because I had no
eyes shadows whatsoever this would be a
great option the only thing this would
be missing is like a matte black which I
do sometimes used to line my eyes so I
would miss that
anyway I'm like going it away I'm like
well but then I could go buy a single
like from what well yes Jessica you
could but that's not what we're talking
wearing but it has deep enough colors as
a few pops of color and then plenty of
beautiful shimmers too so it's got
shimmers and mattes so today when I got
ready and I will show you I used thanks
a lot a
you just kind of blend and basically lay
down a powder layer before I put on
other shadows because it just helps
everything blend a little bit better and
then I applied Bessie probably the best
shade in here in my opinion because I
use that as my transition kind of crease
shade and I just put it all over I even
get it a little bit onto the lid just to
make it a little bit more seamless and
then I applied Plouffe all over my lid
and that is just such a beautiful
shimmery light color and then I took
brownie points and it's this deeper
Brown and I did that in the outer corner
again these blend so beautifully and yet
the colors still stay true to themselves
and that's why I freaking love this
palette and then I used a little bit of
are you kidding me which is just a
little bit deeper than besties I mean
like very slightly to help kind of blend
that darker shade together with the
crease shade and then I applied a little
bit of crystal on my brow bone mixed
with thanks a lot I kind of mixed the
two of them so there's a little bit of
shimmer to my brow bone but it's kind of
toned down by the matte one and then I
actually I didn't show this on camera
but I put a little bit of the crystal
shade there in my inner corner so this
is a palette I can do a lot with but
most importantly I can do my normal
everyday looks with and that's really
what I'd be looking for if I'm starting
from scratch I'm like I need something
that I can use right now for work or for
whatever so I freaking love this it's
been through heck and back and like if
you watch me on snapchat I've mentioned
I feel like every time I talk about this
palette I spilled coffee all over it and
it's still working really well I don't
even know how like I thought oh
certainly they're gonna be weird
none of the shades are weird poor
palette it's this is very well loved so
I love it so so good and great quality
oh my powder I put on all over my face
this is from it cosmetics this is the
one I would just go out and buy
Celebration foundation illumination
powder foundation and I have the shade
fair this is not gonna be your best
friend if you have oily skin because it
definitely leaves almost a not a sheen
to your face but it allows your natural
oils to still shine through a bit and
you can see that you can even see it on
my face right now
I like that
but if you've got really oily skin I
don't know that you'll like this they do
have one that's just their celebration
foundation not the illumination version
I do have that and I like it and it's
definitely much more mattifying so I
think that the the pigmentation of this
is ridiculous this is like the third one
of these I've bought it's my favorite I
would absolutely buy it again if it were
gone I would miss it sometimes I apply
this with a wet sponge as well like
especially on my nose what breaks apart
actually why don't I apply some now so
you can kind of see it just perfects it
like it literally I love this powder so
much it's it's perfect you guys this
powder is amazing so worth every penny
the highlight I actually don't have a
blush and bronzer I figured you know I
could do without blush and bronzer I
mean I have some on but for this I was
like if I'm narrowing it to ten I mean I
genuinely I was like that would probably
be what I would leave out and eventually
maybe by I don't know but this essence
pure nude highlighter I was like I can't
live without I applied it to my normal
kind of highlight zones this is not a
crazy see you from space kind of a
highlight it's kind of in-between it's
not super inconspicuous but it's also
not super conspicuous either it's just
right in between and I love it and I
feel like I can never do it justice and
swatches because always looks darker
with my lighting somehow but I adore
this stuff it's what I'm wearing today
it's the only highlight I'm wearing
today and I just I find myself reaching
for it all of the time all the time and
it's like four or five dollars the
liquid liner I would go out and buy
right away is the NYX epic ink liner
it's a liquid one I use it to apply my
wing Oh usually I mean if I were buying
more makeup than ten which actually I
think I'm going over ten now that I'm
looking at these I don't know how to
count apparently this is one of those
products that I can't believe it's as
cheap as it is it's better than any
high-end I've tried but I used it to do
my wing today I use it to do my wing
every day it's just so good it's black
it stays on I have no complaints about
it whatsoever
I've bought like seven of them and then
the mascara I guess this is a bonus
because I'm at one too
three four five six seven eight nine I'm
already at ten okay bonus but I was like
why would have to buy a mascara this is
the essence lash princess mascara
this one's tied with the lash paradise
mascara so I'm gonna link both below
because they're both my favorite it's so
hard for me to pick this one lasts a lot
longer the last Paradise dries up so
quickly like month and a half and you're
needing a new one it's crazy but it's so
so good that one makes sure it holds
your curl on everything but it makes
your lashes look like freaking not
velvet but like feathers I don't even
know how to explain it
this one is what I'm wearing today and
it holds the curl so well it blackens it
lengthens it volumize I mean it does it
all and it's even cheaper than the lash
paradise and it doesn't dry out weirdly
quick so I love this I've been using
this for a very long time off and on
with that and then of course trying out
other mascaras but that's probably the
one I would just run out and buy because
I'd know it would last longer than the
lash paradise okay extra bonus my
L'Oreal sponge I can't live without it
so there's no freaking way that I
wouldn't pick this up right off the bat
it is the best and since I mentioned it
and used it today I figured I'd throw it
in - oh and I know I didn't mention like
a lip product anything that I left out
it's because I was I thought at 10
apparently I was over ten and so I just
kind of cut it there but I would buy lip
balm I would probably honestly I'd
probably buy the Laneige lip sleeping
mask because I don't just wear it when I
sleep I wear it all day long that
freaking stuff is the best so I will
link it below I love it so much and
again don't let the term sleeping mask
their you off because it is an amazing
balm it's like pink it makes your lips
look freakin juicy and healthy
comfortable to wear it doesn't wear off
weird make sure lips look better
I love it so I hope that you enjoyed
this style of video I had so much fun
going through my collection picking
these products out and I had a lot of
fun applying it and I was like yes like
looking at my skin and stuff especially
in real life because not everything
obviously transfers perfectly on camera
but in real life I'm like yes I feel my
skin looks healthy and it's this is like
my standard everyday look and these are
my favorite products so I hope you
enjoyed if you're interested in any of
course I've got them linked and priced
