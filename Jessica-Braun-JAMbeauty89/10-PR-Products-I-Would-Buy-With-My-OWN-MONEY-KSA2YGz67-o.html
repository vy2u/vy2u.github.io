going to share with you 10 products that
were sent to me in PR that I would buy
for my own money if I ran out of it I'm
going to buy again and if not like some
of them are product like some of them
are brushes that I wouldn't run out of
but like if I lost it I ruined it I
would buy again would have bought myself
had I known how good they were you know
what I'm saying so I am so excited I
actually had so much fun going through
my collection finding these because I
thought first of all I was kind of
amazed at you know I do get a lot of PR
but a lot of the products I love were
actually products I bought myself and I
feel like that's in like the weirdest
way I'm like a proud peacock like good
job just because I never want to be a
channel where all I get is PR and I
think there are some amazing bigger
channels that absolutely buy a lot of
their own products like tot see he gets
a lot of PR but she buys a lot of her
own products too so I think that's super
cool and I hope that more channels start
doing that that you know it shouldn't
just be what you're getting you should
also be out hunting you should be you
know if this is your job or your passion
letter I'm gonna get off my high horse
okay I'm off I'm off of it I'm excited
for this what's gonna get into it where
do I want to begin I don't know okay
let's start with let's start with the
setting spray this is this cover FX
mattifying setting spray I would not
have bought a mattifying setting spray
for myself I'm not a big fan of matte
skin on my face and this was sent to me
and I was like okay well I try I love
this stuff now it doesn't and as I've
said in past videos it doesn't matter if
I so much that you're like like no no
moisture to your skin it really is more
of a you know just a classic setting
spray but it does such a good job of
holding on to my makeup I feel like it
always makes my skin like if it's just a
little bit too greasy oily dewy I'll put
this on and it'll soak up just enough
that my skin looks healthy but it never
looks super matte and that's exactly
what I'm wanting and this will still
work really well like if I've set my
face with like my favorite Laura Mercier
loose setting powder or any loose
setting powder and I'll spray it with
this it'll I feel like it'll just kind
of melt that into this
really well where again it doesn't look
crazy Matt but it just looks healthy and
so this is one that when I run out I
will probably buy again I am intrigued
to try they have like an illuminating
one and I know a lot of people are like
now I'm intrigued just try that one too
but I really a big fan and also the
packaging it's just pretty like the
lime-green and it's like not even lime
green like mint green mmm
another product I would buy again are
these freaking brushes I've talked about
these a lot so I'm only gonna touch on
him for a second but these are these
delians golden triangle brushes I
literally wash my brushes every few
weeks sometimes not as often as that I
heard someone on YouTube they were
talking about bad habits they have and I
would love to fill in that video and
they were talking about like I don't
wash my brushes very often like
sometimes I don't wash them like until
like three weeks later and I'm like if
that's a bad habit I'm the I'm the worst
because I will sometimes go two months
but it's not like I'm using the same
brushes I'll swap them out and I just
have them sitting like in a tray in my
closet and I know that all of those are
dirty and I need to why you know so but
Stella just made me laugh I'm like oh
girl I'm way worse guys there's
something about like the the shape of
the handle looks like this triangular
prism they're so easy to hold very
ergonomically designed and I use every
single brush so the powder brush is
amazing these are super soft they wash
beautifully they dry beautifully I love
their shadow brushes my favorite brush
right now is their 785 tapered blending
just for all over and then some more
pointed brushes they're 783 small
tapered blending for like specific
crease some more flat one I mean they're
all so good and another favorite is
their 945 contour I'll use this for
setting my under eye I'll use it for
highlight I'll use it for country you
can use it for whatever they're so soft
they apply makeup so beautifully I have
not really felt that strongly about
brushes in a very very long time in a
very long time so these are ones that I
could see myself buying like if
something happen to one of these
I would totally buy again cuz I like I
don't use anything I'm obsessed with
them and I don't use the term obsessed
very lightly because it annoys me I am
obsessed with those brushes it annoy
anyone else like are you though are you
obsessed with it you just said you're
obsessed about ten products and this is
a first impressions I want to talk about
a hair one I've got a lot of makeup
don't worry
and so it's from BRE og oh no none of
this is sponsored by the way these are
all they're not because I know I've
worked with Brio geo before like a long
time ago anyway this is their scalp
revival char pitch charcoal and coconut
oil micro exfoliating shampoo when I got
this I was like mmm
no and I literally gave it away to his
sister like brand new well they happen
to send another one in another shipment
and I heard someone talk about and
they're like no this stuff is amazing
and I was like it is so then I got the
other one out tried it in the shower and
I was like Tyler you've got to try this
it's a very minty strong smell but this
is what I've been using to exfoliate my
freaking scalp and I don't mean I am
only getting it just in the scalp that's
why I got rid of because I thought not
gonna just get some stuff in my scalp
and that's it like that's too much work
no it really is more of just a shampoo
you use it throughout your hair so I'll
use it once a week typically like you
know when I wear my hair curly even
though most of the time I air dry it
I'll I still have a lot of product I'm
putting into it you know what I'm saying
so when I've been doing that for like a
week I love this stuff because it gets
all the gunk out all the dry shampoo and
it feels minty some people said it feels
tingly them I don't feel that but the
smell is so refreshing in the shower and
I just feel like my hair is squeaky
clean my scalp is squeaky clean and
briault Gio is one of those brands that
has none of the weird gunk in it no
sulfates parabens but a little of so I
trust them and so another product a
separate product I don't have it so I
actually am going to buy it again the
next time I place an order is I'll put
on the screen the Brio Gio
don't despair repair mask so this I use
as a deep conditioner honestly I use it
every time I should I wash my hair every
time I think you're only supposed to use
like once a week but I'm like
just use it whatever I want so I fly
through that stuff Tyler used to he
liked it a lot and it's just it's so
moisturizing you put it you know
throughout your hair after you've washed
it honestly I love using it with this
like when I had both of them open at the
same time I was like this is heaven I'm
using a different deep conditioner I do
like but the brioche you want is better
and again as none of those weird gross
things like sulfates middle so I love
that as well super moisturizing like
even today so like I didn't use any of
those kinds of products on my hair today
and I feel like there's just little bits
of frizz that are not there when we use
that freakin mask it's the craziest
thing
it completely affects the way your hair
looks when it's styled and for me I feel
like that's so rare to find and that's
why I'm like I feel like I need to shout
from the rooftops
how good these are so this one and the
other one I mentioned I will link below
definitely buying the other one now that
I'm out I'm trying to work through the
one I'm using now and it's just sorry
we're on here I'll touch on it quickly
this is the living proof curl enhancing
styling mousse this is what changed the
game for me with my natural hair because
I really I don't know I felt like I was
in a rut for years like my hair was like
kind of wavy curly ish and it would be
okay but I could never get it to look as
defined as it looks and as kind of like
put together until I freakin tried this
they have this whole curl line I love
all of it but this is the one I have
already repurchased like three times
it's a mousse and for me if you've got
naturally textured hair like me I've
said like me way too many times
mousse is so good at adding that volume
and I noticed that if there's a day I
don't use the mousse I don't have the
volume it's completely absolutely fluffs
your hair out but it defines the curls
and so actually I'm using a brioche EO
curling something it's not is it even
yeah I think it's for its ther curl
something oh it's like there amino acid
curling stuff and it's a gel I'll use
that then I'll use this and I really
like that together but this is like the
magic product so if you have hair like
mine try it I flip my hair upside down I
get the ton of mousse in my
and I just kind of sprung into my
hair and then I'll throw a little
hairspray on it let it start air drying
for a while get ready go back and kind
of diffuse blow dry my hair upside down
and this is what ends up looking like
and I'm like this is perfect for
everyday for me it's quicker this smells
really nice I freaking love it oh my
gosh alright back to some makeup thank
you for joining me in the haircare
department one product that I love so
much it's so expensive
it's the Marc Jacobs palette and glam
Bishan so as you know all of these were
PR that's the whole idea of the video
they sent me a bunch of theirs and this
is the one that I recently declared my
palettes and I can link that video if
you're curious if like what did I get
rid of I got rid of a lot and this was
one of the ones that you know when I saw
it I thought I never reached for it and
I know how much I love it but I have too
many palettes and that's what it's one
of the reasons I was inspired to
declutter my palettes because I was like
there are these amazing palettes of my
collection I forget about because I'm I
have too many
it's a wheat to sift through to weed
through so this one's in glam Bishan
it's got some mattes it's got some
shimmers I have been using this so much
for work because honestly when I've got
30 minutes to get ready and I'm like dry
shampooing my hair and I'm like alright
we got to get this going I will throw
this like kind of light color all over
I'll throw this in the crease and this
in the crease throw one of these two
shimmers on the lid use one of these to
kind of line the top and bottom throw
mascara on and my eye look is done and
these shadows blend so well and these
are the kind of shadows that look like
velvet like they always no matter how
bad you are at makeup like when I'm in a
rush please sometimes when I take my
time it still looks crazy but anyway it
just it always looks seamless and I feel
like when I wear this a lot of people
like I should looks really nice today
and I'm like thank you and I'm always
like it's that freaking Marc Jacobs
palette like it always just looks so
seamless like you really know what
you're doing and I attest that to the
quality of the shadows so this is
something that if I ran out of this I
could see myself buying again this
reminds me of the Lolita palette they
used to have that I used to have and I
got rid of because there was like a
literary one in there I didn't use and
but these colors I use every single one
and I love it a lip product I love are
these pixie mat last liquid lips so they
sent me a bunch of these I would buy
these with my own money like genuinely
these are so they're matte liquid
lipsticks but there's I don't know like
these make my lips look so healthy and
it makes no sense because they they do
dry down but I love this color this is
pastel petal and depending on your lip
like it actually looks a lot darker than
that on my lips when I wear it but I
know on some other people it doesn't
look super dark so it just depends I've
got naturally darker lips but these are
just like one of the most comfortable
matte looking lip products and I love
these two because I'll put these on and
if I don't want it to be completely
matte I'll just throw a gloss on top and
it always meshes so well with whatever
gloss you put on top your lips look so
juicy and big and I love that about
these so they have all kinds of shades
this is another one evening rose it's a
little bit darker but the DOE foot is
just comfortable to use because it comes
to a point you can really line your lips
with it I'm still wanting one from this
line that is my perfect neutral because
this does like I said darken just a bit
while I do really like it I feel like I
need one just a little bit lighter and
so if they ever came out with one I
would run out and buy it but anyway so I
really I love the formula of this the
packaging is cute the applicator is
really nice and the look is gorgeous now
it's still a matte liquid lipstick it's
still going to eventually dry and
eventually you'll need to either reapply
or take it off I mean it's not a miracle
worker but I was just it's one of the
few that I've been very very impressed
by a newer product to my collection is
the first aid Beauty coconut skin
smoothie priming moisturizer when I ran
out of this I'm probably in a Buy It
Again this I like better than my
Smashbox primer Iser and I a while ago I
said that and I was like I think I do
now that I've used it more like no I
definitely do so I used this as a primer
sometimes I'll use it as just a
moisturizer
and put another primer on top I don't
know why I just did that those weird but
it's so more like I could almost use
that so moisturize are my freaking hands
you know what I mean
so moisturizing but it has this glow to
it that's not glowy like a like the
backlight priming filter where there's
like that definite glow
it just looks healthy healthy healthy um
has a slight smell some people say they
absolutely love it I don't notice the
smell being super strong or anything
like that but then other people say it
does so I don't know I'm like what's
wrong with our noses why are all of our
news is different but it says it's safe
for sensitive skin and I've just fallen
in love with it it's so moisturizing my
skin loves it it hasn't broken me out at
all and I've now been using it probably
for a little over a month now I just
really another PR product I got is the
Urban Decay Naked petit heat now I did
get the naked heat palette and that one
I gave away I liked it but it just
wasn't my favorite but this one I got in
the mail and I was like I love her I get
so excited getting these things in the
mail but as I looked out I'm like I
don't know oh my gosh this palette is so
good and if you're intimidated by like
warmer colors still I say still because
I was for a long time it's so easy to
use like you might be a little nervous
with the orange but these blend so well
you've got some crease shades you've got
some lighter shades and deeper shades
and I just I I'm reaching for it so much
more than I thought I would so I'm
thankful that I did get in PR cuz I
don't know that I would have bought it
on my own just seeing it cuz I'd be like
oh I already have palettes like this but
this has been in my everyday makeup
drawer for quite a while I really really
enjoy using it every look comes out so
nice they're all matte so you do you
know if you want some shimmer you have
to pull that in from something else but
I'll use the dark one to line just it's
perfect it's got everything I could need
for a warm tone look and I love that
it's small last one's controversial
because it's two-faced and I feel like
everything to face does is controversial
in some way or another but it's there
peachy maths or just peachy mattes
palette I have this in my car to buy and
then I
happen to get it in the mail before I
actually I always add a bunch of stuff
and I usually wait a week because I like
to think about it and like like Jessica
don't just buy it on a whim so luckily
I'd been waiting because I ended up
getting this in the mail on my few I
would have bought it myself oh my gosh
it's definitely has a strong smell but I
love the looks I get with this again
another warm tone palette but you've got
even more options with this the
packaging is probably my favorite
packaging of any eyeshadow palette ever
and I genuinely mean that because it's
got a really good magnetic closure it's
a really sturdy like really pretty
packaging the mirror is great and the
shadows I mean oh my gosh so really
really easy to blend
definitely pigmented I just I love it so
much and every time I wear this this is
another thing that I feel like I always
have a good eye shadow day when I use
this so if anything happened to this I
would buy it again so those are the ten
products I was counting the brushes as
like one so it was more than ten but you
guys catch my drift these are the ten
products that I just loved so much that
I got in PR that I would totally buy
again if I ran out or if I lost it
whatever if you enjoyed this kind of
video let me know this is something that
I feel like I could do this kind of a
video every few months just because you
know as I try more and more PR I think
it'd be fair to be able to do this um
and I never want you guys to feel like
just because I got something in PR I
mean love it because boy do I talk trash
about a lot of products that I get in PR
that I don't like because that's the
point of my channel to review products
right anyway if you enjoyed I hope
you'll subscribe and I will see you in
my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
