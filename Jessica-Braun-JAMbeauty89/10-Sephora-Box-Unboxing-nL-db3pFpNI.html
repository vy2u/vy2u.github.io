share with you my Sephora play box for
well they send it so darn late this is
the one for April even though it's May
when you're watching this probably
anyway unless I upload it today because
it's like April 30th but I don't know
anyway they send this so late in the
month does anyone else do we all get it
at the same time is it always so late
which doesn't really matter it doesn't
but if you're a youtuber and you're
wanting to like share that before the
next month it's like impossible unless I
come like hey I get it anyway it's just
frustrating small frustrations in life
it's not a big deal Jess it's not a big
deal
so this is ten dollars a month I will
link it below if you're interested I do
buy my own they're not they don't send
it to me i buy it more because i like
trying new products now here's the thing
I've done if see in the past I didn't
boxycharm GlossyBox I've done Birch Bayh
everything I feel like I've done it all
and while I have really enjoyed this
I've enjoyed boxycharm I think about
Reece absque reiben from time to time an
Ipsy - I just feel like a lot of the
times it's I start getting like the same
products over and over again and with
Sephora and some of the time I might
fall in love with the product in one of
those but then I can't you have to go to
like a weird website I've never heard of
to order from it to be able to order the
product my client so at least with
Sephora I know that anything being sent
is definitely sold as Sephora and I'm
like it's easy enough and I have the
flash shipping so it's free shipping if
I want you know and that I like and
that's just my own thing but I know some
of you guys have voiced that same
feeling so let's go ahead and dig in so
it always comes with the cute little bag
this one says make it snappy and it
always has like an info sheet with 50
Beauty Insider points you can redeem on
your Beauty Insider account so I'm
seeing something really expensive in
here
yay so first thing is from Urban Decay
these are their hi-fi shine Ultra
cushion lip glosses now I actually
already own these but this is a very new
product so like if you have not tried it
yet this is an awesome way to get to try
it now this color SPL is the shade
obviously these are
deluxe sizes but this I will say oh this
would be a really pretty topper color
it's just a sheer kind of pink glitter
but it look really pretty on top of
things I can put it on my lips let's
just try it this is a what I've
discovered about the I actually do like
these glosses and what I've discovered
is they and they have this minty smell
to them they're a thicker gloss so you
had to kind of almost pile more on but
it's an actually in my opinion kind of a
comfortable gloss so that's what it
looks like on top idea it looks nice so
this is a great topper color I mean I
guess you could wear it alone but it
just looked kind of sheer with some
glitter which could look really pretty
too especially if you have pigmented
lips already or you could like take
lipliner and color your lips and
completely and then top with this soon
that'd be pretty and I've just really
been into putting lip gloss on top of
lipstick because the lipstick makes my
lips look even but then the lips gloss
makes them look healthy it's a little
more comfortable to wear throughout the
day you know so I actually do like these
glosses a lot a lot I have a few in my
purse as we speak next product in here
is this is what I was talking about this
is from freaking trunk elephant trunk
elephant is expensive it's so expensive
this is their TLC sook re baby facial
now I actually have a full-size of this
I have not opened yet they'd sent it to
me and I was all excited but I just I'm
trying to be really good and like I've
got to finish what I'm using right now
before I just barrel into everything
else I'm excited to try so it says use
once weekly apply an even layer to clean
dry skin leave on for 20 minutes we
rinse thoroughly with warm water and pat
dry and then it says follow with their
marula oil for best results and I do
have their marilla oil and it is amazing
also really expensive just a super
moisturizing oil so I want to read what
it says on the info card about this like
is it a exfoliator is it okay okay it's
described as an at-home facial that
sweeps away dead skin scales with
professional-grade ingredients so yeah
would consider this like a chemical
exfoliant yeah it's a H a and B H a
packed mass delivers expert exfoliation
with a cocktail of acids that gently
renew tone and clarify even the most
sensitive skin without irritation let's
just say your skin will be baby soft so
that would explain the baby facial name
well that makes me excited to use a seat
now here's the thing I already love my
good jeans product this is a leave on
treatment this is one you rinse away so
do I need both open at the same time no
so I am glad I waited because I
literally just film the skincare video
and I freaking love the good jeans
but it's that same idea where it's a
chemical exfoliant now this I have heard
that if you've got crazy sensitive skin
you really need to you know try it once
wait a week try it again slowly build up
kind of your tolerance for your skin for
me I I've been able to use it like every
other day with no problems but anyway so
once I'm through with that I might give
this a try and I love that now I also
have a trial size but if you've never
tried it I mean this is such an amazing
way and it's it's half a fluid ounce
that's not bad because this product is
expensive I can tell you that was
certainty alright next product in here
is the Sephora Rouge cream in the shade
the red I love red lipsticks and I'm
always like you know aren't we all
looking for like the perfect whatever
shade you like I love red I'm always
looking for the perfect red that is a
really pretty red this Sephora cream
lipsticks are really creamy I feel like
we've gotten one before it was a
different shade the thing is it's like I
know it's a good line but unless it's a
shade I know I'm gonna wear it's like
new who cares that but this is a shade I
would wear so I just love red lips so
much that's a really pretty color it's
not too blue but it's not too you know
kind of red or yellow orange e toned
either it's kind of written between no
wonder they call it the red but I do I
like the formula this a lot next product
in here let's see is the Peter Thomas
Roth skin to die for no filter
mattifying primer and complexion
Perfector let's read what it says about
this because anytime a skincare company
makes a primer I'm always like my ears
are perked up because I'm like you know
we put on so many layers on her face and
the primer that you're using to actually
be semi good for your skin is a huge
bonus because if I'm putting on a primer
that's just clogging my pores and then
I'm putting on foundation it's like a
boy I'm doing I'm putting on tons of
layers or my skin can't breathe
so this says it's a lightweight primer
that blurs imperfections reduces the
looks of pores it feels weightless yet
keep shine at bay plus it fills and fine
lines and visually reduces the size and
shape of pores both immediately and over
time so it says after your moisturizer
you put a pea-sized amount into your
skin you can wear alone or with
foundation of course let's just swatch
this so it's kind of a beige color
definitely has that feel of like that
kind of silicon velvety pore filling
feeling to it but again there are tons
of products like that I don't notice the
smell at all which is nice
whoa I will say my hand skin looks like
a baby's bottom right now like it really
actually does maybe I should use pore
filling primers more often so often I
don't because I'm like I feel like it's
calling my skin but maybe this would be
the answer for me because it really if I
compare my this hand skin where I just
put it to the rest of my hand it's like
night and day holy crap I could stare at
that all day so I might give this a try
and if I like it I might buy that
because I've gotten rid of lots of
primers so I only have the few I really
love but I really don't have I think I'd
like one maybe two pore filling primers
I really like but if this one's good for
your skin that would be awesome so I'm
actually really excited about that next
product in here is from living proof is
this seriously one of the products or is
it like a bonus it's the living proof
perfect hair day shampoo and conditioner
I've used the perfect hair day it's like
their cream you just like putting your
hair and it's lovely or is it the
perfect hair day dry shampoo I don't
know I tried so many living proof and I
don't think I've found a single living
proof product that I didn't love like I
love their curling products for when I
heard where my hair naturally I just
bought hold on this is crazy
I literally just bought
from Sephora and I'm doing a haul maybe
tomorrow from living proof it's their
blowout faster easier salon where they
blow out it's like a finishing spray
anyway so it's just funny I really
genuinely love them so and this is gonna
go in my travel drawer I'm sure I will
use it I will probably love it so maybe
that was a bonus now that I'm looking at
because I thought this was gonna be a
perfume
it's from purity made simple but this is
actually one of the products so I think
this must be the extra because they
always have like a extra little sample
like a perfume sample I wonder if that's
what that was yeah it even says it just
gets as this month's bonus read read yes
so this is it says it's a multi action
face mask that banishes blackheads while
smooth skin banishes them it's rich and
creamy clay mask removes blackheads
exfoliates skins and warms as a deep
cleans for visibly clear skin luxurious
experience plus mask selfies are so in
so true anyway so you let it dry
completely and then you rinse it with
warm water and they say to use it twice
a week Ian fisting it says it's all
silic acid I might let my husband try
this cuz I know he's all about like
black Hitler he's not all about
blackheads he wants to keep rid of it
anyway so I might pass this on to him
and I think salicylic acid is one of the
products when I'm pregnant I shouldn't
use I don't know that's such a journey
for me I'm glad I'm not pregnant for
life because I'm like I need to do more
anyway so I might pass this on to him
because I think he'd actually just
really liked it so all in all let's see
is this worth ten dollars that's always
what I kind of asked myself each month
when we do this this holy moly
holy moly I'm so excited about this the
lip gloss is teeny tiny it's tiny but it
is a nice lip gloss and again it's one
of their new products so it's a cool way
to try and decide like mm do I like this
enough to buy a full size or is this
enough for me you know whatever I'm
really excited about this skincare
version of a primer really so that is
something I'm gonna be using probably
starting tomorrow the packet bonus is
you know now that I know it's a bonus
I'm not like upset about it
the last two things were the Sephora
lipstick and the little clay mask
they're nice enough but really I think
these two are the two things I
personally am the most excited about so
again I like that it's a mix of some
skincare some makeup to me that's what I
prefer versus all skincare or all makeup
but anyway if you're interested in this
like I said I can link the subscription
link below but other than that I hope
you enjoyed I'll link my last Sephora
play unboxing down below if you're just
kind of interested in like what is it
like month to month if I were to
subscribe you know is it awesome every
single month is it kind of and I feel
like it's usually pretty darn good it's
