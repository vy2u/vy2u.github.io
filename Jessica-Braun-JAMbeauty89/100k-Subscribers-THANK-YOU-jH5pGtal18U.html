subscribers last night and my Twitter
was going crazy and my Instagram was
going crazy in the comments and my
videos were going crazy you guys are the
most spectacular face of subscribers
that anyone could ever ask for and I
know that everyone on YouTube says that
but I've got the best it when I started
my channel two years ago i'm gonna try
not to cry cuz you guys know i cry in
like every video and i'm not gonna do it
yes i will i probably but I when I
started my channel two years ago I think
about I remember calling one of my
sisters and saying hey I think I might
start a YouTube channel she was like
what do you mean like YouTube has
channels like yeah and there's this
whole group of people that watch these
makeup videos and she was like we
talking about money I don't know and I
had stumbled upon it because I was
looking for a review of this really
expensive foundation and I wasn't sure
if it was any good and I didn't want to
spend i think it was like a land co on
Seattle you remember what kind of was
but it was like a forty-dollar
foundation so I googled it and a YouTube
video popped up and i watched it and
then i watch more of that girls videos
and then slowly but surely i just
figured out that there was this whole
world and little did I know that on that
fateful night when I watched that one
video that this would become something
that not only is a job of mine which I
am thankful for every single day but
that it's a source of joy in my life and
that it's something that I just love
doing like right now it's my spring
break and I was so excited to have the
time to just film and to take my time
editing video and it sounds so dumb but
it is something I enjoy and I I just
can't fathom that I have been blessed
enough from you guys and from God
because I believe it in and with my
family and my loved ones that I've been
able to do this and I can't thank you
guys enough for always being there and
for those of you that have been around
since I had
a hundred subscribers a thousand
subscribers as I moved on up you guys
have stuck with me and I know some have
left and come back thank you for coming
back I know there were times in my
two-year career so far that I haven't
been as good as I maybe was or i am now
but I think that's just me you've been
watching my learning curve as I kind of
wade through all of this stuff that's
new to me you have to understand that
all of this you know talking to
businesses and figuring out what a
sponsorship is and is this one a good
sponsorship do I believe in it or not
and saying no a lot I'm not used to that
and this is all new ground for me and so
thank you for sticking with me as I
figure all of this out I still got so
much to figure out and learn and I know
that my channel will will kind of grow
and change and morph but always in a
good way just know that yes this is a
very exciting day for me but it just
makes me want to work even harder to
make sure that my videos they grow when
it comes to quality but they don't
change when it comes to the content that
obviously I'm still going to be doing
drug store stuff and if I show a high
end product from time to time that's
just because I've been fortunate enough
to try it out and maybe review it for
you guys or I'll do a dupe video with it
which you've seen a lot lately on my
channel but it will never become a
channel where it's only high-end you
guys know that that'll just never happen
that's not me I probably will never have
the money for that and even if I ever
did I'm just not going to change I just
love going in to CVS or Walgreens or
Target wherever and going through those
those makeup aisles and just picking out
the new maybelline product and the new
revlon thing just ah the drug store will
always be my heart and have my heart so
just know that that will never change i
know there's always concern i know that
i think it when i watch someone you know
their channel grows and I'll see y'all
when they're only talking about high-end
stuff and oh they'll never talk about
drug store stuff and I always get
nervous that they'll change but usually
they don't I think it's easy to assume
that someone will but you have to just
hope and trust and believe that they
won't and
you know hopefully they're in it for the
right reasons I hope that I am and I
know that I'm still enjoying this every
single day and wow I don't even know why
I'm putting this video up now cuz i'm
talking about stuff I didn't plan on
talking about but here we are I am so
elated and overjoyed and thank you so
much i hope that you guys will follow me
on my social media i feel like i've got
such an amazing base here but i don't
have as many over on those and i
interact so much more on my instagram
and twitter because it's just a little
bit easier like on my phone to reply and
two retweet or to comment on your photos
that you might send me on instagram or
to comment back on photos that of mine
that you comment on so please find me on
instagram and twitter and I've got my
facebook to where I'll post like when I
post a new video or anything like that
i'll post it on my facebook i'll put
those links below there always below my
videos but i feel like a lot of you guys
aren't with me on there and i would love
to have you guys there because that is
where i feel like i'm able to really
communicate with you guys and get to
know you guys and hopefully you can get
to know me a little bit better another
way to find me is of course on tyler's
channel and you know I've gotten a lot
of guff for talking about him but like
that's my fiance that is my best friend
like of course I'm gonna talk about him
and what before he had a channel i
talked about him a lot it's just you
guys didn't know him so i felt kind of
weird but now that a lot of you guys do
know him from his channel I feel more
comfortable bringing him up and of
course he's been in videos here and
he'll be in another one soon and we've
already filmed which I'm excited to put
up but I'm in tons of his videos over
there we do all kinds of videos and we
do that's where all of our black vlogs
go like any of our everyday or our
travel things if you're curious about
what I'm doing you see it over there I
don't really I don't have a vlog channel
clearly I don't know if I ever what if
we did we'd probably just do one
together but regardless definitely find
this over there I don't feel guilty
about talking about him because that is
my life like he is my life anyway so
again the entire reason for this video
was to thank you guys and i know i just
went every which way but my mind is just
reeling right now thank you so much from
the bottom of my heart
I did it I didn't cry I think I cried
enough last night when it I like was
actually happening that I think I got it
out of my system now I'm just feeling
elated thank you so much for always
sticking by me and for standing up for
me when someone maybe posts an off-color
comment I know that you guys will always
just enforces just stick up for me and
it's just amazing sometimes I'm like
that was inappropriate but it makes me
laugh a little bit so thank you for
sticking up for me and I'm sure I will
see you in my next video and thank you
thank you thank you i can't say it
enough ha i love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
