bringing you a bunch of life hacks that
I have been using that I wanted to share
with you guys so let's go ahead and get
into it
epidemic sure you can buy a pack of
shower curtain rings and then you can
use that on a regular hanger probably a
stronger hanger to hang all of your
camisole and tank tops it's a great way
to save a lot of space in your closet
but not only that it organizes them so
you can actually see all of them as
opposed to having all your camisole take
up room in a drawer where they're all
stacked on top of each other and you
can't really see anything plus it helps
to make sure there aren't any wrinkles
or anything in that because they're kind
of freely hanging I get so annoyed when
I'm taking out the trash from all of our
different rooms from the two bathrooms
from the bedrooms things like that what
I found makes it way easier is when I
can just take the trash bag out and
right underneath I have a few extra
trash bags at the bottom of the trash
can so that I can right away immediately
put the next trash bag liner in so then
I don't have to go to another location
grab the bags go around and put them all
in there already there and ready to go
it just makes that a lot quicker it
makes me more likely to take out the
trash more often because I'm lazy and
that's just my reality so there you go
one hack I use when I'm grocery shopping
is I'll take pictures of my pantry but
also of my fridge and freezer so that
way if there's any question about gosh
do I need mayonnaise or do I still have
lunch meat I can just look and see okay
no here's my deli drawer picture I see I
don't need lunch meat or no we've got
two cans of chickpeas for the hummus
we're good we don't need any more it
saved me a lot of money and since we
live in an apartment where there's not a
lot of space especially like in our
freezer in our pantry if we buy a ton of
cans of something we just don't have
room so we like to have exactly what we
need and not too much more so that has
helped us a lot
so speaking of space if you want to
recycle but you feel like you have no
room to have like a recycling bin or
anything like that just hang some really
strong nailed in hooks in like a utility
closet we have this one that's you know
it's kind of one of those weird closets
where it's just really dark there's not
room for anything but it has like our
water heater and things like that in it
we just hung two different hooks one
side has a bag for paper recyclables the
other side has the bag for you know
glass plastic etc and with that then
when we're ready when it's full we can
just take it off the hook tie it up put
it in our car and take to the recycling
place or if you've got pickup even
better and jealous but that way it
doesn't take up a lot of room it's space
we're gonna use otherwise but we still
have the ability to recycle which is
fantastic
the next hack and this is a pretty
well-known one but I've recently used it
use nail polish to color code your keys
I've got you know a peel box key my
apartment mailbox key our apartment key
I've got keys for the school my
classroom you can just nail polish over
them different colors you could use a
dotting tool to kind of poccadot them if
you want or to draw designs instead of
spending money on really nice designer
keys like I have one that's a Minnie
Mouse one I can save money and just use
what I already have to make them cute
and that way I can just use nail polish
remover to wipe it off if I decide I
want to change it up from time to time
one of my favorite hacks is in your
laundry room hang a hanging mailbox and
put a little you know trash bag it could
be just a store or grocery bag whatever
in there and then every time you empty
your lint from your dryer you can just
put it in there and then from time to
time you'll just take it out and put a
new one in it's easy because then you're
not dragging lint all over the place
plus it's an incentive to just empty it
out more often because that really can
be really dangerous to keep that lint
trap filled with lint so for us it's
been so helpful before we used to take
it take it all the way to the kitchen
and we would get lint all over the place
I mean it wasn't a huge problem but this
certainly has helped just kind of really
quickly clean it out it's right there
it's fantastic and again that was space
that we weren't using on the wall and
it's right
the next one speaking of laundry take
laundry sheets or perfume samples from
magazines whatever put them in your
undergarment drawer or just in a drawer
where you feel like your clothes maybe
don't stay fresh
I've got we've put them even at the
bottom of trash cans there's so many
uses for things like perfume samples or
just laundry sheets because they smell
so nice and you'd be surprised at how
well they keep things fresh and they're
easy to replace from time to time and
they're you know not really expensive at
all one thing both my husband and I do
is we replace our toothbrush and our
loofas every three months so our hack is
that we set a reminder in our phone for
every three months
to remind us hey replace your loofah and
toothbrush so we just buy toothbrushes
in bulk from Sam's Club we buy a couple
loofahs at a time so we always have a
couple back backed up just because for
me I feel like loofahs they can get kind
of gross quickly because you know it
takes a while for them to dry out each
time and then you wet them again there
has to be a lot of bacteria growing and
that from time to time so it's a great
way to make sure you're keeping up with
that and so if you buy them in bulk if
you set your reminder then you're more
likely to do it and stay cleaner another
hack we have is if you have a lot of
magnets that you love we buy magnets
every time we travel anywhere we buy a
magnet but instead of cluttering up our
fridge with it because we just don't
again our kitchen is really small we
don't need any more clutter anywhere we
put them on our washer because it's
magnetic it's out of the way but then
every time we're doing laundry it kind
of just makes a smile seeing it and
thinking oh I remember when we went
there it's just a way to keep all those
memories and all those lovely magnets
but they're not necessarily in the way
and they're kind of hidden when you shut
that room off another hack if you get
bored easily with the things on your
walls I do just place a bunch of photos
or posters behind the one you have
showing in a frame and then from time to
time maybe every few months if you get
tired of it you can just switch it out
for one that's behind it and then just
shut it back and hang it right away and
that way you've got you know fresh
things on your walls or in your frames
on your
but you didn't have to go find it or go
buy something new it's all just right
there for you
my last hack for this video is if you
like doing puzzles like we do but you
don't necessarily have all the time in
the world to do you know sit down and
finish a puzzle
what we decided to do is start doing the
puzzle on a board that you know will fit
and then when you're done for the night
or whatever you can just slide all of
that under your couch or maybe your bed
somewhere that dogs and kids can't get
to that way it's protected for them but
not only that you can slide it right
back out and do some more if you want
and then put it back away then you don't
feel like you have to break it apart and
put it away just because you didn't
finish it or you don't feel like you
have to leave it out on your valuable
table space that you might need for
other things you can just put it away
for a while and pull it back out when
you're ready to do some more it's a
great hack for if you do like puzzles so
