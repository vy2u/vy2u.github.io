finally going to share with you guys the
dupes that I found for the artists or
artiste but however you want to say it
oval seven brush this sucker like gained
cult status in like two seconds it's
like overnight all of a sudden oh my
gosh I've met swatches all over my arm
and seemingly Ariel is using them and it
the idea is this one is about the size
of the spoon I mean literally it looks
like a spoon from behind that's when I
first saw I thought why are people using
a spoon on their face and raise your
hand down below with the emoji is you
thought amazing like that looks like
someone they got spoons all over their
eyes and it's 50 but this is the old
seven brush they a lot of different
sizes here's the kicker
this is sixty two dollars and so people
are using it you know to blend their
foundation in whether it's liquid
foundation cream foundations whatever I
thought I want to try this so I bought
it and then I also bought a do this one
is you'll see right away size wise there
are different size so that's the most
glaring obvious difference there's also
big difference in you know this is
silver they have a couple different like
handle versions I think and this one is
kind of this like bronzy gold this one
1395 this one $62 so yes sideways are
not the same but I wanted to test how
are the bristles when I'm actually
blending foundation in does it look the
same regardless because that's the idea
you want the experience to be similar
and you want the end result to be the
same for a brush dude
he sells bigger versions as well so I'm
sure I could find like a bigger our
teeth brush that might be the same size
but I wanted one that's smaller when you
first feel them they feel the exact same
amount of like they feel exactly the
same
the Brandenburger orlag or all of course
have links to both of these below but
it's really really soft
in fact softer than the our teeth but it
is like the art each one's a little like
bit more straight whereas this one is a
little bit more rounded but I realized
that in applying it it didn't make it
different so I know on snapchat I've
been teasing you guys and showing myself
applying foundation with these so I'm
going to show you as
of me applying foundation one side with
this and one side with this
you decide for yourself if you think
there's use so I've already applied my
moisturizer and sorry I woke up with a
cold today joy enjoyed so I'm going to
apply my coverfx calming primer to cut
in the outer part of my face just
because my skin I've got a huge breakout
here I've kind of just had some really
weird skin flare-ups so I'm applying
this everywhere even my nose just
because it looks like it needs to be
calmed down I don't always apply this to
my nose but it's a my moisturizing but I
like to use this when my skin kind of
reddish or you can just tell I've had
breakouts things like that I'm also
going to use my milk makeup blur stick
just on my nose because that's where
I've got my largest pores it just kind
of fills them in really well sometimes
I'll take this farther but good the
foundation I'm choosing to use is my ELF
flawless finish foundation I love this
stuff so so much I'm wearing the shade
sand so I'm going to use my our teeth
brush on the left side where I've got my
breakout I don't think his foundation
I'm trying to remember I don't think
this foundation on its own will cover
this breakout but that's okay
I mean not that deep because I can just
go in later with a concealer this is a
little bit darker than my skin tone but
at blend I usually look pretty good so I
usually just kind of warm up the bristle
I'm weird I probably don't need to but I
like getting them ready to go
and I usually start from the center and
work my way up
it really is amazing what foundation can
do so with this applying it it's just so
easy to blend you don't feel like you've
got streaky makeup on but you also don't
feel like it sheers it out it really
lets the foundation do its job and it
does the job of brush just you know
spraying it around and then letting it
sink into the skin and I love that it
doesn't eat up a lot of foundation but
it also doesn't you know not eat any out
where you're just wiping it around it is
amazing of course this is smaller so
knowing that it is going to be different
using this bigger one to apply it won't
be as easy to get like around here
although a lot of people don't put
foundation there anyway so it doesn't
really matter maybe not so do the same
thing on the other side
so I have to say of course I sped it up
for you but I will say this takes about
half the time because the surface area
is covering so you know I'm like swipe
swipe swipe swipe swipe in my entire
cheek is done Rasmus is smaller one like
swipe sweat sweat sweat sweat so it's a
lot it just kind of depends but I do
think that this one is quicker just
because it does cover more and I've kind
of realized that you can just kind of go
over the eye it still gets into that
crevice if you want to like I said not
everyone does so looking at it really
really closely you cannot tell the
difference the coverage is exactly the
same there's no streaky lines nowhere
where it looks like the Foundation's
been rubbed away from being blended
these are both the exact same others in
size the exact same look at the end the
same soft quick comfortable experience
it doesn't feel like you're tearing at
your skin you guys have no idea I know
if you've never touched one of these
they don't look it but they are the
softest things I've ever used I don't
know how to describe it so obviously
these products are so similar you know
if you've got a gift card or you're
really wanting to splurge then go for it
because it's an amazing product it
really isn't you know so much so that
they don't sell any other size of the
McGraw brand brush yet I'm hoping me to
eventually but I really do want a
smaller one for concealer because I've
been using these for concealer and
because it blends it so well but it's
really hard obviously to get in the
creases of it but they both give that
exact same flawless application there's
also soft and comfortable to use I mean
they're foolproof anyone can use them in
their foundation will instantly look
amazing so I think you can go either way
I really don't think you have to spend
sixty two dollars on this really
expensive version unless you're wanting
a smaller size because like I said now I
know there are tons of dupes and sets
and all kinds of brands out there on
Amazon and on a million different
websites so if you know of ones that are
really good that maybe size-wise might
be some
but you've also tried and you know are
good because I know there are a lot out
there that look the same they might you
know appear the same online but you know
sometimes it's too good to be true and
you might get a whole set for $20 but
then they're terrible so you know I know
that this one's really good and that's
why I would really recommend even though
it's bigger I would say go for 1395 even
the box that came in you know it was
really nice it explains what it does
says it's made of rounded fibers that
not only effectively improve application
but also exhalation but also effortless
Leslie but also effortless effortlessly
why can't I say that but also
effortlessly blend your powder cream and
liquid makeup unlike any conventional
brushes I would agree it's carefully
designed with an easy grip handle so
it's got a black handle and slanted back
for high precision blending and
comfortable usage this stuff is made a
full-day website so what's weird is when
I go to the board's website they have
like four products they have tweezers
and eyeshadow palette and illuminating
powder in a contour kit I don't even see
the brush on here but I bought it on
Amazon I don't know
long story short it's amazing I'll link
them both below I hope that this video
is helpful hopefully I saved you quite a
lot of dollars I've always did it for
that because I mean sometimes you can
just find the exact same thing for way
cheaper and why spend your money when
you can save a lot of it and buy other
some of that or save it so if you are
into Dukes or you're wanting to save
money on makeup I have done a million
dupe videos ok that was a huge over
exaggeration
I've done a lot of Duke videos and I'm
very proud of so I will link my Duke
playlist below I hope you'll subscribe
so you can catch more of my future Duke
videos that I like to do in the meantime
catch me why social media I love to post
on snapchat as I mentioned earlier and
you got a sneak peek if you follow me on
snapchat of applying this other than
that I will see you guys in my next
video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
