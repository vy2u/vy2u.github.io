kind of a different video I've been kind
of toying with this idea but I wanted to
share with you guys 15 different
products that are from the drugstore
that have been there for quite a while
now there are a few of these that are
newer but most of these have been
sitting in the drug so for maybe over a
year some of them for a like five six
seven years and I feel like they're kind
of under the radar like now all of these
are talked about very much so I think I
want to title this video like top 15
drugstore products that are right under
your nose you know that you maybe don't
know about you see them all the time but
you don't know that they're awesome or
maybe you don't even notice them at all
so I feel like it was just time to give
some of these products some love because
they weren't getting the amount of love
that I think that they deserve I will
link every single product that I
mentioned down below if I can find it
online I'm pretty sure I can find I'm
pretty sure I can find all of these
online that's the beauty of the
drugstore so I hope that you'll
subscribe if you like drugstore videos
high-end videos any kind of beauty I do
it all I hope you'll subscribe to catch
more of them and let's go ahead and get
into it oh where to begin let's just
start with one that I didn't know about
until recently this is the Neutrogena
revitalizing lip balm I'm sure I heard
Emily Noelle talk about it cuz she's the
one that always gets me on to trying
more Neutrogena stuff when I watch her
videos this is in the shade soft caramel
and it really is just a lip balm it has
sunscreen in it but it has a little bit
of a tint and a really like watermelon
II smell but these are so comfortable
and beautiful on the lips if you're like
me and when you're going to work you
don't always want to put on like a lip
color but you want something so that
your lips don't look like dry and crusty
so this is a great option because it is
a lip balm but it has that little tint
of color and I just I love the shape of
this and I drop things constantly I love
the shape of this it's like a little bit
more like an oval and I think it smells
amazing now if you're sensitive to smell
you wouldn't like it but it's a good lip
balm and I had seen this and just my
eyes would always go right over it you
know what I mean so definitely worth
giving a try I want to try some other
shades as well the next product is this
eye shadow from Maybelline this is the
Maybelline expert wear eye shadow in the
shade
nude glow this shade is like a high-end
beautiful shade it's this gorgeous
shimmery bronze it looks amazing on its
own you don't need anything else with it
I'll put it all over the lid and then
I'll just grab a brush to kind of blend
it up into the crease to make it look a
little more seamless and that's it and
it looks so so gorgeous this pan I'm
never gonna run out of it
so this shade Newt glow I've even I mean
honestly often times I'll just use the
actual sponge tip applicator to apply it
because it really packs it on and it
looks so gorgeous and metallic perfect
for fall as well but I wear it
year-round the next product is this
L'Oreal magic perfecting base this has
been in the drugstore for as long as I
can remember and it was like one of the
first drugstore primers that was out
there and then primers became really big
and now everyone has them but this has
been around for a very long time and
it's kind of this whipped feeling almost
lotion life but when you start to blend
it in it really becomes like satiny and
then all moaning like velvet it makes
your skin feel like velvet now I don't
like to put this all over my face
because I have kind of normal to dry
skin I always put it on my nose when I
use it because it fills in the pores
amazingly and I do think the best way to
apply foundation over is with a sponge
because once if you're using a brush and
you're rubbing over it I do feel like
this can tend to almost pill up but if
you use a sponge and you're pushing it
the product into your skin over it it is
perfect so it's one of those random
products that's very kind of pore
filling very smoothing I even used it on
my under eye a little bit like for fine
lines I don't think it's as amazing for
that purpose but you totally could use
it for that reason so I love this stuff
it's been there for so long definitely
worth a try the next product I am
wearing today this is the NYX HD
finishing powder in banana
some of you guys are like oh my gosh you
talk about all the time but no one else
does and I'm like everyone should know
about this so it's under $10 and the
shade banana usually banana shade things
are too dark for me but I love to put
this on my under eye over any concealer
it is so brightening it doesn't end up
looking super cakey like other under-eye
powders do you could use this anywhere
sometimes I'll put it even on my nose
and here just kind of set the area but
it is an amazing under-eye brightening
powder I'm never gonna run out of this
pan and I cannot recommend this highly
enough next product is this Maybelline
better skin skin transforming powder so
it has salicylic acid in it it comes
with a big mirror and then it's got the
powder and then like a sponge now I
don't really use a sponge anymore I did
for a while but now it's gotten older
I'm like no I could wash it but anyway
but it has a breathable area for the
sponge to kind of dry out and not you
know breed bacteria within anyway this
powder is amazing if you're prone to
breakouts it's amazing for that it has
decent coverage but it doesn't look
cakey on your skin now it's still a
powder so when you see yourself like in
the light if you have peach fuzz like
most of us do you know you're still
gonna see that because it is a powder
but I think this is just a great one
because I love I love using it like I'll
throw this in my purse and use it to
touch up really quickly just because you
know it does have all that I need to
touch up and it just looks good even
after you know wearing makeup for seven
hours that day applying this on top of
it it actually still looks really good
so I really I love this stuff the next
product is from wet &amp;amp; wild it's their
perfect pout gel lip liner I have all
the shades but these are - I really
really like these are just these
retractable lip liners there so let me
wipe off my powder they're so creamy and
pigmented and they stay in place and
they're just amazing and they're so
cheap they're so cheap they have like I
think five or six shades this beautiful
red one is called read the scene and
then this kind of more pinkish one is
called never petal down very pretty pink
so I think these are just incredible you
don't have to worry about sharpening
them they stay I mean they do everything
you want an ellipse I nor to do and on
top of that they're really pigmented and
creamy so I can't speak highly enough
about these as well there are a few
people that will bring these up and
especially when they first came out but
I still really really love them the next
product are these Revlon Colorstay
cream eyeshadows when I first reviewed
these I really didn't like them because
the way I was applying it was with my
finger and so while it did okay I have
noticed that there's a little I mean I
knew this but there is a brush that
comes out of the lid kind of bizarre but
if you apply it with this brush it
provides the pigmentation is so much
more just stronger and I mean it just it
totally makes the product a different
way better products this is the shade
705 and my other favorite shade is 740
look at the brush just because the shade
is so unique it's like this kind of
purplish gray I don't even know how to
describe it it's really really cool so
those are the two shades I think they're
so neat the only downer is that you do
have to put the brush back in and
eventually I mean you don't have to but
I mean you probably would and so I
always try to clean off the little
silicon like brush before I put it in
there so that would be one thing to
consider you know I don't know like I
wish it was different packaging but I
get why the brush is a part of it
because it really does make a difference
in how the product applies the next
product are these NYX perfect filter
palettes so one of these I've had for a
while and I was gonna mention this on
its own but I just like literally today
hauled this one so I wanted to show it
anyway but this is the one I've had the
most experience with these perfect
filter palettes are amazing the
pigmentation is just incredible I think
there was only one shade in here that I
was like mmm it's this kind of yellowish
shade it's just really weird it doesn't
really do anything but the rest of them
are so buttery so gorgeous I mean it
feels like a high-end palette I mean
it's just gorgeous so this palette is
called olive you and so it's got some
nice greens and bronzes and then of
course some other pops of color I love
these now the one I hauled today is
called golden hour and this is
absolutely gorgeous for me this is way
more up my alley because well I like
wearing shades like this but it's there
just the shades are so pretty
there's this one here actually this
shade looks a lot like that Maybelline
shadow I showed earlier but I mean
they're all so pigmented I just love
them it's a mix of matte and shimmer and
I just feel like not a lot of people are
talking about these and they should be
next up are these maybelline superstay
matte ink lip colors so in all fairness
they haven't been around for years and
years they're new this year but these
are the most amazing long wearing lip
colors the best I've ever tried and I've
tried really expensive ones all I mean I
swear I feel like I've tried everything
out there but these like stay on all day
but they're comfortable they kind of had
to have this little bit of stickiness
ish even though it's completely dried
down and you can do this and it doesn't
come off it they just still feel
comfortable throughout the day it's kind
of crazy so I've done a whole video in a
long wear test where I check in so you
can see how it looks every few hours all
the way to the end of the day and it is
incredible so the more I've tried these
especially after that video the more
I've realized how much I really do love
it cuz in that video I was for the most
part I really liked it but there were
little things like the feel but the more
I've tried it the more I've really
fallen in love with it so highly
recommend any of these this one is in
the shade 15 lover
I like this shade a lot the next product
is this foundation from Rimmel it's the
Rimmel lasting finish skin perfecting
full coverage foundation I wish it had a
pump and I've heard that in some other
countries they do maybe I made that up
and you can buy pumps for these kind of
like on random websites where they make
them but it doesn't come with it when
you buy in the drugstore but this is
under $10 I want to say it was like
$5.99 where I got it it is the most
beautiful full coverage foundation well
I'd say like medium to full and it just
looks amazing on the skin it looks like
a high-end foundation I've tried a ton
of high-end foundations that were
nowhere near as good as this one is so
if you can find your find your shade you
will love it if you can't I mean you can
mix them they're cheap enough that you
could maybe afford to buy more than one
I hate having to mix foundations but I
do it from time to time if I love the
formula enough but anyway it's
incredible it does have SPF doesn't yeah
it doesn't say how much SPF but it oh
there it is SPF of 20 okay
sleeve nextly is an eyeliner from Milani
this is the Milani stay-put waterproof
eyeliner it is the blackest creamiest
liner I've ever tried now you do have to
sharpen it and in fact I need to sharpen
it but this is the shape linked on black
it's shade number one just pure pure
darkest night black I just love it it's
it really does stay in place it's
totally waterproof and they say it is it
really is and I think even the packaging
is pretty so it's just about I mean I
will use this up and then I will
definitely buy another one and if they
ever discontinued I would totally buy
like ten of them and just keep them
until I need them because they're it's
incredible next is the NYX hydro chuck
hydra touch primer I almost didn't
mention this because I had heard from a
few of you guys that you think they may
be discontinued it I had kind of looked
and I was still have it'll find it
online so if I can still find it when
I'm actually uploading this I will link
it below I've also heard that they might
be repackaging it and just putting it
under a different name so if any of you
guys know please let us below let us
know below I filmed it too much today
anyway this stuff is an amazing it's a
hydrating primer but it just like I feel
like it gets rid of redness the second I
put it on my skin looks better it
doesn't really have a noticeable smell
and it just my skin always loves it like
I feel like the days that I wear this
primer my skin does the best and so I
feel like it actually holds onto
foundation now like this is not a this
is not a mattifying primer by any means
so if you have super oily skin it still
might be worth trying because I don't
think it's like it doesn't make my skin
and oil slick it just really hydrates it
so if you have oily skin and you and
you've tried this please let us know
below because I'm I am curious how it
would look but I freaking love this
stuff I like I have probably 40 primers
this is the one I reach for and I'm
already like all the way down to here on
it I had like 40 primers I sounded like
I was bragging I'm not trying to brag
trust me
I just you know considering how many I
try and all that stuff and how many
options I have I still reach for it that
was why I mention okay
next is this this concealer from number
7 it's their radiant glow concealer this
is another one I talk about a lot but I
haven't heard
people talk about it reminds me of the
why I sell 2 o'clock but better and way
cheaper it's just it conceals it
brightens it like I'll put it here and
just tap it like three times and it's
completely blended in it's like the
weirdest most amazing concealer I've
ever tried oh my gosh I love it so much
it might be my favorite number 7 product
I've ever ever tried so highly recommend
it next up is this covergirl advanced
radiance powder I've heard a few
youtubers talk about this but I feel
like covergirl powders are like what my
mom used when I was growing up so when I
think of covergirl I think of my mom and
like her using you know it's always the
same shaped compact the way that
covergirl makes them kinda has this like
iridescent lid which I think is really
pretty now it comes with a little puff a
little silver one I usually just use a
brush it did get really weird and bumpy
like within one or two uses but it's a
really high coverage powder that has a
little hint of radiance and so I've used
it on my under eye it can look a little
bit cakey if you you have to be really
careful putting it on your under eye
because I know a lot of people use it
but I'm like it can look very very cakey
under there but when you just put it all
over your face it can look so gorgeous
perfected again it's still a powder so
if you go in the sunlight you're going
to see it on the peach fuzz you know but
it's just a really pretty powder I was
really impressed with this okay the next
one is from Physicians Formula this is
the natural nude highlighter it has like
12 little squares and they're all
different shades some are bronzy and
when you swirl it all together you know
you can get little pockets of different
shades but when you swirl it all
together it's this gorgeous
highlight that just looks beautiful on
everyone like it's just it's an amazing
product it's so creamy and buttery and
it's gonna last me forever it does have
this like little brush and this little
like sponge thing in the back and a
mirror I don't really ever use it just I
just don't
but it's amazing it really is now this
is one that I have heard a few people
talk about because it is amazing but oh
I love it so much so those are all of my
recommendations of things that I think
are a little bit
under the radar at the drugstore if you
have any recommendations for products
that you think that maybe not a lot of
people know about but are amazing from
the drugstore definitely let us know
below because I love reading through the
comments on videos like this and just I
add stuff to my like shopping list it's
so fun and I know you guys probably do
that as well so other than that I hope

thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I'll see
