exciting news two big pieces of news two
announcements I've never done a video
just like announcing anything before and
I laugh because I've always seen like
people I'm subscribed to and they're
like some some some and huge
announcement and it's always like I'm in
a commercial or I've been magazine and
I'm like no no it's not in those things
I mean let's be real but I'm excited to
share both of these things with you so
my very first announcement is probably
the most important well definitely the
most important and it is that Tyler and
I are engaged I still can't believe it
and if you follow me on Instagram I
posted about it about a day after it
happened and oh my gosh like it was so
surreal on the way he did it was so
perfect and so simple and exactly what I
would have dreamed of and that man is my
best friend I'm crying already that man
is my best friend and I am so excited to
share life with him and the ring is
absolutely stunning I can put a close-up
picture he did such a great job and I
just I am over the moon and overjoyed
and I cannot wait gosh I can't wait to
live with him and I can't wait to one
day have kids with him and I can't wait
to share every adventure all of our
travel adventures with this man because
I love him so much so that is the
biggest piece of news and the most
exciting and I know a lot of you guys
like on Instagram when I posted the
picture of our engagement just for
saying you know oh my gosh
please share your wedding plans and you
know we want to come along this journey
with you guys and I would love to share
that with you guys I don't know how
detailed I'll be but just know that we
certainly don't want a big wedding we're
very simple people to be honest I know
I've got a lot of makeup and you
wouldn't think I was but I have a very
simple person and we planted it being
very small and very simple and we're
looking at this coming summer and yeah
so that's all we really know right now
we've got a lot to plan but I'm just
excited to even just plan it with him so
I will certainly take you guys along
that journey with me as we go into
planning and things like that which is
so exciting but beyond that I have
another piece of news and that is that
Tyler
my I was gonna say my boyfriend my boy
fiance my fiance has the YouTube channel
as well and he launched it a few weeks
ago and a lot of you guys saw when I
posted on some of my other social media
saw those links and you went and
subscribed to him and he was so ecstatic
and I was so ecstatic his channel is
devoted to travel and it'll eventually
chain morph I'm sure just like mine did
I had big plans for mine and now I've
gotten into a certain niche but right
now his is focused on travel but it'll
also touch on other things but every
video he's done has me in it hello so if
you want more of crazy me you could see
a lot of me over there because all of
his videos are basically vlogs and
travel videos of us traveling together
so far he did a really long Disney vlog
of us and Disney and just us
you know taking you along for the entire
10 days we were there and I loved
watching I think it's fun but he's also
done one when we were in Mackinaw City a
vlog of us there we've logged in gosh
there were a few other played he already
did where else I don't know but he does
a lot already edited he's just slowly no
he has a lot already filmed obviously
he's slowly editing and uploading so if
you're interested in that that's kind of
like for right now my vlog channel
because I don't have one and frankly I
know the time to have a separate Channel
I wish it eventually one day I'm sure I
will but for right now that's kind of
been serving as my vlog channel but it's
all his baby and it's his whole thing so
the channel is called Tyler travels TV
and of course I'll put the link below I
am just so excited and excited to share
that with you guys and excited for you
guys to see kind of that side of me you
see me in my room and you see me talking
about makeup and hair and fashion but
you don't see me talking about travel
very often or us together and us just
goofy and so I think you'll enjoy it you
guys will love him as much as I do that
is for sure
he's also he did film parts of our
engagement I don't want to say anymore
because you just need to see it
eventually that will be up that might be
in a while but if you do want to
eventually see that certainly subscribe
to him see you'll get that update in
your newsfeed but I'm so excited and I'm
excited to see all of you guys over
there I comment back on those videos
very often just because I love when
people are over there and their
interests
sit so i've commented on a lot of people
like responding to them on his channel
so i just i can't thank you guys enough
for all the support and the kind words
and the picture i put on instagram of my
engagement and on twitter had more
responses than anything i've ever posted
ever I mean you guys are so supportive
and so loving and so just caring even
though no we've never met but you're
just so kind-hearted and loving and I'm
thankful because I feel like some people
have subscribers that are just kind of
mean and I feel like I don't have that
here and I just got a huge support
system and I felt all the love from you
guys and Tyler is for all the love from
you guys and we are so blessed so thank
you so much for always supporting me and
always supporting him and I just love
you guys so much even though I don't
know you personally I feel like I do
anyway hopefully this video I know it
was blabbering and of course I cried in
it but I hope you'll join us on this
journey please subscribe to my channel
if you're not already subscribed to his
new one as well and I'll catch you guys
very soon bye
