second installment I can link below the
very first video of these I did a couple
weeks ago with my first what's in my
everyday makeup drawer so this one is a
little bit different you're gonna see
some similar products because they're
just products I use everyday that I love
and then you're gonna see some different
ones products I'm trying to use up but
also products I'm trying to try out so
here we go so back here I just have
random things that are always there just
extra Beauty Blender type things and
stuff like that and I've got my Mogador
nurturing eye cream I have my Mac
palette and actually in this palette the
only Mac shades are rice paper and sable
these are all elf as is this one and
then these are benefit ones that I just
depotted and actually they're not
magnetic and actually they're also a
little bit too small for this so I just
used like a sticky tack you know like
teachers used for posters I just use
sticky tack and they're great they're
not going anywhere
it's really kind of awesome so that
worked out really well and these are all
shadows that I love every single one of
these shadows so it's awesome now that
they're all together so oh and
underneath those I have my naked one and
naked two back here I have my wet and
wild color icon and reserva Cabana
I use this a highlight elf tone
correcting powder I used a lot and it
was in my September favorites video I
can also link that where I feature this
and a lot of other products I've been
loving this one was a surprise I'm so
surprised I love it so much but I really
do back here this has become my little
section for products I want to use up I
have my Revlon Colorstay I don't want to
use this up except for it's almost gone
and the packaging is driving me nuts
look what happened I don't even know
what happened it's on the inside of that
and I have one already as a backup so
I'm just kind of ready to be done with
this bottle and start the fresh one this
product I like the brightener shade but
this is just the concealer one it's okay
it's almost gone I'm gonna use that up
the L'Oreal the balm I also like but
it's so close to being done this one
might be readied we thought I mean I
think I have like one more day's use the
Urban Decay primer potion then just two
liners and NYX and a Smashbox one I'm
trying to use up they're almost gone so
exciting to know that this many products
will be used up you know love that okay
over here I have one of my favorite
bronzers the covergirl one and copper
rating
a nice gray tone one I'm trying out this
brush little retractable kabuki brush
for bronzer seeing how I like it I'm
gonna be packing up and leaving for a
week in about a week so well depending
on when I get this video up so I'm
thinking about bringing that I want to
see how I like it my covergirl and Olay
eye corrector concealer that I really
really love of course is in here my
weapon I'll cover all I love so back
here my ELF eyebrow treat and tame I use
on my brows right now elf makeup remover
pen the covergirl flamed out all these
are amazing I think this is in my
September favorites as well I love it
I'm trying out this Victoria's Secret
shimmer fierce liner duo
I'm just trying out I actually haven't
really tried it at all and I've had it
for like a year this is my new who
favorite mascara
Palladio curls will I love it and then
my Anastasia clear brow gel is their
here I only have one blush the pH
matchmaker by Physicians Formula
and this one's interesting because it
it's very very pigmented but when you
apply it with like a stippling brush it
is really really nice you have to apply
still apply it with like a mitt a
stippling brush puts it on really nicely
applies it nicely that is and it really
does after about 5 minutes like kind of
change according to like your skin it's
very odd but I like it I mean it's just
so interesting okay over here two lip
products I've gotten here this is the
Revlon blushing mom it's just a pretty
kind of everyday color close it later
the benefit sugar bomb lip gloss I like
and I'm trying out some more my
Anastasia brow powder duo and medium
brown I use this to blend my shadows
together wet and wild drool a NYX single
eye shadow on flamingo one of my
favorites my L'Oreal lacquer liner that
I love Tarte smooth operator finishing
powder I use to set my under eye area
then over here I've just got my Beauty
Blender sharpener tweezers lotion just
saying acne treatment things like that
that I would use like kind of like tools
and wow that was kind of quick that is
everything that's in my drawer and I
will be sure to update you guys as soon
