with you guys my favorites from Sephora
I love affordable Beauty if you're new
to my channel I do a lot of drugstore
product reviews drugstore hauls Dollar
Tree hauls etc but I also own a lot of
things from Sephora I've done plenty of
support hauls kind of ironically I'm
wearing only drugstore products on my
face today because I filmed a drugstore
get ready with me I'm doing this video
with ebay - I've done a million videos
with I love this company it's a website
I'll put the link for Ebates below but
basically every time I ever shop online
whether it's the vib sale or just
Sephora during regular season Ulta
during regular season anything I always
go to Ebates first because basically you
just get cash back I know it sounds kind
of like a scam I promise it's not it's
literally you go to the site type in
whatever website you're looking at so if
it's for Ulta Amazon whatever you type
it in then they will tell you how many
percent cashback it is at that time so
Sephora might be 8 percent or 4 percent
or 10 percent whatever it is so then
I'll click shop now and it will take me
to Sephora and then I can shop like
normal but I know that because I went to
Ebates first I get whatever that percent
is cash back so if I spend $100 and it's
10% cash back I'm getting $10 back you
know $200 I'm getting $20 back and it's
literally cash you get back in your bank
account it's not a scam it's not like
anything weird it's as simple as that
there's no weird business so I've talked
about Evie it's a ton for good reason I
love them so definitely check them out
no matter where you're shopping online
if you've used Ebates before and you
know what I'm talking about let everyone
know below so they know I'm not like
blowing smoke
it's like legitimately amazing I'm going
to do this video by category so I'll do
some lips I'll do some eyes some face
and I'll also do nails and fragrance I
had to think about all right so let's
start with lips because I feel like like
I'm really into that especially during
the holidays because I like wearing more
red or brighter lips during the holidays
so my first favorite will shock
absolutely no one
is the Marc Jacobs Lamarck lip creams
I've bought so many of them all of them
separately it's insane
so what I would typically be wearing
when I'm wearing a red lip other than
this this is drugstore is the shade and
oh my Lee these lipsticks are expensive
but if you're going to get the vib sale
I mean you're going to get a good
percentage off this would be the time to
buy it if you're ever going to buy it
any shade but these are super creamy
they're crazy pigmented I'll show you
all of the shades I have now so you can
see it what they look like but I also
have sonic truth infamous and bad
behavior these are incredible the one of
that behaviors in this gold packaging
which is really pretty but I also really
like the black the packaging is magnetic
so when you take it off it just
magnetizes closed which is really nice
like I feel like it's really luxurious
the next product I would recommend is
one that semi new to me and now I want
every shade it's the Marc Jacobs lip
gloss in moon glow now I know jaclyn
hill recommends one in sugar sugar that
one is always sold out so assuming you
can't get it moon glow is a good second
option not even second it's a beautiful
option regardless it's this gorgeous
kind of neutral light pink it is light
so if you don't like a lighter look to
your lips you wouldn't like this but if
you do you will love this I love the
sponge tip applicator it is such
beautiful simple packaging and I can't
stop using it I do not mention a lot of
high-end lip glosses in fact I almost
never mention them but this is one I
really do feel is better than most of
the drug show ones I've tried so it's
worth purchasing I really like it
another product I have to mention it
looks like I'm wearing this but I'm not
although it would look pretty similar
this is the Kat Von D everlasting liquid
lipstick and it's in the shade outlaw
this is on a sponge tip applicator it's
really thin and long and these lasts
forever
it's insane you know what I'm going to
apply it
top of this you guys can see you can
kind of see the shade it's a little bit
brighter than what I'm wearing which
kind of looks good in the middle I'm
wearing a Maybelline color blur by the
way in partner in crimson which I love
but this looks really nice on the inside
and this stuff lasts forever
it is amazing they have a million shades
you can find a million swatches online
on different skin tones if you're you
know kind of struggling between what
shade to buy you can find everything you
need to know on Google but I love this
formula lasts forever and it's really
thin so it feels comfortable it almost
feels like you're not wearing anything
and yet it looks amazing
another product I would recommend buying
during the sale is the Sephora cream lip
stain I have one in the shade 0-6 I'm
sure there was a name for it but I only
see the number but this is a really
pretty light pink kind of rosy shade I
like to wear this to work and again it's
a similar formula to Kat Von D to be
honest there gosh there really are
similar I think the Kat Von D might be a
little bit better but they're really
really close I don't think it really
matters which one you buy but they both
have a lot of shades this one looks
really nice like I've worn it to work
and it looks nice it's a nice everyday
color
let's do eyes next I actually only have
a couple of eye favorites and we're
going to hop right into my faith
favorites I've got a lot of those so my
first favorite is a palette it's the
only palette I'm mentioning in this
video you know as I looked through my
ridiculous palette collection I thought
what would I genuinely genuinely
recommend to someone that was just my
friend like you guys are my friends and
it was this one it's the Too Faced
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette this
was one that I never thought I would buy
when I looked at the pictures when this
first came out I thought is like no I
don't like those clothes at all and I
didn't like looking at it it made me
crazy I didn't like there was that there
was that random blue in there relate
threw me off like I feel like the
palette shouldn't have that I still do
but it has this amazing chocolatey smell
it if you okay I've said this before and
everyone made fun of me but I was like
whatever if you get a little bit of it
on your
and and you like it it tastes like
chocolate I've made my husband do it
I've made my husband's brother
my brother-in-law do it and they all
admit yes that tastes sweet it tastes
like chocolate it's crazy it's amazing
but besides the blue color these colors
are amazing and if you can ignore it
just look at the other colors aren't
they beautiful like it's this amazing
neutral palette
they got mattes they've got shimmers it
smells amazing I've done some amazing
looks with this I can't recommend this
highly enough if you don't own any
palettes or you don't want any of the
chocolate bar palette or the Naked
palette I would still recommend this one
above them all because I think it offers
enough warm and cool colors that it
makes it worth the price the next I
favorite is a liquid liner this is the
Stila stay all day waterproof liquid
eyeliner I've used this a million times
of videos it is my absolute favorite it
trumps everything I've ever used when it
comes to liquid liner it's got a felt
tip it lasts all day it's easy to apply
it it lasts long time that in my opinion
makes it worth the price and if you're
ever going to buy it the vib sale would
be the time so you can at least save
some money on it but I love that last I
favorite I have is this Anastacio it's
actually a brow product but this is the
anasazi a dip brow pomade in medium
brown I was so against this product for
so long and I don't know why it was this
stuff is amazing it for me is the
perfect color again I'm not wearing
today I'm wearing an elf brow pencil
which is amazing as well I'll link it
below but um you can hear Pinocchio
played with my husband in the other room
anyway I love this stuff and I was so
against it because I was like why would
I want to put like a wax on my brows
like kind of a creamy like feel gonna be
hard to blend no it's easy to blend easy
it stays on all day like it is
incredible I would recommend buying a
nice brush with it though I'm using I
can show you the anastasiya like kind of
duo brush the Anastasia number 7 brush
where it's a duo it's got a small
spoolie and the kind of pointed brush
it's worth the money and again the sale
is a perfect time to buy them I would
say buy bowls together there
amazing together so let's talk about my
face favorites I have a ton this is the
bulk of my video our face is important
for me that's one of the things I focus
on the most because I feel like it's so
much of what people look at so my
favorite primer and this one's new to me
but I've used it everyday for quite a
while now and I am so obsessed this is
the cover FX calming primer I don't know
why people aren't talking about this
everywhere I feel like it literally
calms my face down not only is it kind
of cooling but it just makes my redness
kind of simmer down right away it makes
my skin smooth and it makes my
foundation going on so perfectly my
foundation never looks better than when
I use this primer before and I love it
so much again like I said I don't know
why more people aren't talking about it
now it is
I feel like more moisturizing than it is
mattifying I kind of feel like it's in
between but it leans a little bit more
lotion like so if you've got crazy crazy
crazy oily skin you might not like it
but anyone else I think you will love it
my next favorite is a foundation it's a
stick foundation a lot of people are
talking about this for good reason this
is the hourglass of vanish stick
foundation I've got the shade shale I
actually have a couple shades in this
they sent this to me awhile ago and it's
the weirdest formula because it's
actually so creamy like it goes on like
a liquid foundation I don't know how
else to explain it
I have tried probably ten different
stick foundations I've hated every
single one of them this is the only
stick foundation I've ever used that I'm
like that's actually really good like it
makes me feel like oh there can actually
be a good stick foundation it's really
creamy really emollient and comfortable
to wear and it lasts all day so it's one
of those things that it's worth the
money the only downside is I feel like
you're going to run out of it quickly
now I haven't run out of it yet so I
will say that but I feel like you know
considering that it's just a stick and
you rub a lot on while you're blending
it in with a brush you know I feel
you're going to route of it quickly if
you use it everyday but it is amazing so
I don't know this would be great if you
have
skinned anyone else get like baby hairs
back here like look at this that is real
that is real life for the all of my life
forever and ever so the next product I'm
mentioning is a concealer this is the
Kat Von D concealer cream it's their
laka concealer cream and oh my gosh this
stuff is incredible I don't know how to
explain it like you put it on and you
blend it in whether it's with a Beauty
Blender or a brush or your finger it
melts and seamlessly and looks amazing
it's just a flawless concealer I just
love it I didn't think I would like it
and like I've told you guys in many
videos I'm new to the Kat Von D product
world like I really haven't tried much
from that company but this stuff blew me
away I love it if you haven't tried it
this is the perfect time I've got two
bronzers to mention one is a cream one
is a powder this is the Chanel so late
and a Chanel could we all save together
so late and as you know this stuff is
mentioned by many people for good reason
I finally bit the bullet and bought it
what was I waiting on I have never found
a bronzer I want to use more than this
every single day I reach for my little
elf stippling brush and I apply this and
I look at myself at the end of the day
and I think oh my gosh my bronzers still
perfect it is the only time I've ever
noticed my bronzer being perfect
I feel like I'm hitting this stride
where I'm like finding so many amazing
products that at the end of the day I'm
like oh my gosh like I actually look
okay whereas before I would feel like oh
the foundation looks good but the blush
doesn't or the eyeshadow looks good at
the lipstick doesn't I found so many
amazing products and this is one of them
this is the best bronzer I have ever
used in my life I have hated cream
bronzer blushes etc I don't like
applying them but this one is kind of a
little bit thicker than a normal cream
so it applies and blends really well
and it doesn't move I don't know how
else to say it it is
amazing so if you can save up you can
ask for for Christmas your birthday as
for gift cards save them up you know
whatever it takes but this stuff is
incredible that's all I'm going to say
about I got to move on this video is
going to be a million years long the
next bronzer I wanted to mention is from
the SA edit which is Estee Lauder's kind
of newer kind of edgy err brand and it's
the called their barest bronzer and this
one's in light it's got kind of cute
packaging again kind of edgy this
started out was like a little splatter
of like gold kind of shimmer on it that
Wornall that wore away like right away
which was good because I don't really
like shimmery bronzers this is the most
perfect light bronzer it's just this
simple kind of I don't want to say
orange just a perfect bronzer I like the
name barest bronzer because that's kind
of exactly what it is it's humongous
the packaging is cute it stays on all
day as well it is great sometimes I will
take my Chanel one and top it with this
just a light dusting of this just to
kind of set it and it really looks
amazing but if you've been just looking
for a really nice bronzer that's a step
up from the NYC sunny or that you know
the ones it's the same a similar look
but it lasts all day it looks a little
bit better like a lot of it better and
actually when I matched it mention is a
contour product I've mentioned this for
years it's the Kevin a Quan sculpting
powder and medium this is for when you
want a chiseled look I'm gonna be honest
I have a contoured truly contoured ever
no I am surely contoured in a long time
and this is one of those kind of gray
tone ones that's perfect if you're
creating a shadow I have been onstage in
a couple years but when I am that's what
I want that's where I learned about
shadowing and contouring was when I took
stage makeup classes so for me this is
like a like yes but it really is amazing
again it lasts a long time it's super
expensive for a small product but if
that's what you want this is incredible
and it does come since it is expensive
with like a little dust jacket little
tiny baby does check it so the next
thing I want to mention are blushes
these are from NARS and again this is a
great
time to buy them when you can get money
off I have two shades that I love this
one's in deep throat and it's a
beautiful Riteish gold pink I just love
it
these again lasts all day they are more
expensive but they last all day so in my
opinion oh my gosh it's kind of worth it
this one's in sin and it's much more um
very like much more cool tone blue toned
whatever you want to call it so they're
very different blushes but again the
formula is amazing they last all day and
I love these two shades next thing I'm
gonna mention is this Becca Becca
shimmering skin Perfector I've got an
opening of a million shades you guys I
gotta be honest again this was a product
that I waited on for a long time because
I was like I don't use cream
highlighters like what am I gonna do
with that but then I would realize if I
did this on my wrist or on my arm
I would just kind of blend it in and
then I would take like a stippling brush
this is not one it's just the brush I
had I would grab a little bit on the
brush and I would just dot a little bit
on my cheek and it would look so good I
might as well keep going while I'm at it
it would look amazing it would just kind
of amp everything up to the next level
and I would think oh my gosh like it
just that's what like when I look at a
magazine I'm like oh my gosh you look
amazing that was the difference in my
opinion so this stuff is incredible I
think opal is a beautiful shade but like
I said they have other shades I've used
enough that you can actually see that
I've used some which in my opinion is
crazy because this is huge but it's one
of my favorites ever and it's so took me
by surprise okay I see the difference
though like I love it and it doesn't
look powdery in the Sun either so it
just looks healthy speaking of healthy
glows this one is new to me this is from
RMS beauty and it's the living Luminizer
and I just recently got this I've only
used it a couple times but I've let me
reiterate I've only used it a couple
times and yet I am blown away blown away
you only need a tiny bit of this stuff
and it's almost clear and now I can't
really put it on but you put it on and
in the same kind of spot it
unbelievable I was Google image
searching people wearing this and I was
like what so many celebrities and
celebrity makeup artists to use this
because it's so simple there's no weird
flashback it doesn't look powdery and
yet you don't need a lot you just Pat it
on it looks incredible luminizing it
looks like white in the pan but it does
not look like when it's on it is
absolutely gorgeous oh my gosh and it's
kind of new it's really popular so it'd
be if you bought it now you kind of be
on the ground floor in my opinion the
next time I'm going to mention are all
of my hourglass powders I've got a blush
I've got two different palettes you step
three but I'm going to show you guys my
like singles because I love them enough
to get a single so my favorite favorite
is the one in dim light this one I use
just as an all-over powder honestly and
it just makes my skin look healthy
there's not like shimmer to it but there
is a little bit of a glow to it I don't
really know how else to describe it it's
the weirdest thing if you've never tried
it you've got at least try it in the
store or something because it's weird
it's unbelievable how you can put a
powder on it and yet look makes you look
healthy but not powdery and not dewy
it's weird
I also have this one in luminous light
which has does have a little glimmer
it's a little bit actually it's like the
exact same color of powder so this one
is in dim light this is luminous light
and yet it just has glitter added to it
so if you want that same kind of look
but you want to add a little bit of
shimmer this is the one you would like
so I love that one as well these stay in
place all day they look gorgeous and
natural light inside florescent they
look beautiful always I also have one of
those strobing powders that I like and
euphoric strobe light these were sent to
me a long time ago this was the only one
I kept because I liked it so much it's
such a pretty very shimmery highlighter
but it doesn't look as crazy as like
just a glitter or just a crazy highlight
like there's a million like the becca
ones i like but they are a lot this one
is really really beautiful and catches
the light and a shimmery but it's not
like a freaking strip on your cheek bone
you guys know what i mean love these of
course i have the trio palette as well i
have the new one this is the
get lighting Edit I also love it's got a
nice combo and I love that it has a full
size of this finishing powder
it's gorgeous it reminds me of dim light
so I love this I love the packaging but
if you already know a product or a
powder that you like I would say just
get the single because you get way more
let's talk about nails for a second then
we'll talk about fragrance so the oh my
gosh I have never tried nail products as
good as these ever in my life these are
the Sephora formula ex-prime excel and
shine excel these are these clear
polishes you put the primer on first as
a base coat then you put on any nail
polish then you put all the shine XL
it's better than such B it's better than
the Orly rubberized base coat it's
better than the oh my gosh I've tried
everything the Revlon ones which I used
to love so much these are the best I
have ever used
I've had this nail polish on for now I
don't have very long nails
keep that in mind I've had this on for
probably five days there's hardly any
chips that's unheard of for me whether I
use OPI or its nails Inc or it's just
seÃ±or
it's any kind of Sally Hansen they all
seem to chip at the same frequency it
doesn't really seem to matter the brand
this is what actually makes the
difference in them and this stuff is
amazing it is worth every penny if I
could recommend one thing it'd be this
set I don't think you need one or the
other you need both they're amazing a
shade that I love in the formula x range
I wanted to mention is this X Hearts
Rouge or just Rouge I don't know I think
it's X loves Rouge I don't know that's
what it says but I love this red color
kind of matches my lips it's so
beautiful especially for the holidays
but any time of year I like red on my
toes as long as it doesn't look like
that deep like ox blood I don't really
like that but this looks bright it makes
your skin look kind of vibrant in a good
way and I just think it's such a pretty
color and it looks amazing with these I
want to get more of these formula X
actual polishes but like
said any polish works with these you
don't don't feel like you have to get a
formula X polish the last two products
I'm gonna mention our fragrances and I
feel like fragrance is so personal but
these are two that have all half of ones
I've tried I've probably tried like I
swear thirty that are sold at Sephora
it's not 40 I'm very picky but ones that
I feel like are kind of universal that
would smell amazing on everyone my
favorite favorite perfume I've ever
tried is this one this is the chanel
Coco Mademoiselle perfume this smells so
sweet and amazing and every time I wear
it someone comments and says oh my gosh
you smell good no thanks whereas other
perfumes I wear I swear people like you
know what I mean but this one is
universally appealing which is the idea
of perfume in my opinion umm this other
one that I recently fell in love with is
by Versace it's Versace bright crystal
this one is a sila sweet smell and a
universally appealing smell my husband
likes both of these which is a big deal
because I don't think he likes the other
perfumes I have but this one smells kind
of deeper and woodsy err but not musky
at all and that's what I like about
because I feel like there are a lot of
like woodsy smells that are like deep
and sensual but they smell musky but
this smells mature but not like an old 8
I don't know how to describe it it's
amazing if you've never smelled this go
smell it in a Sephora or anywhere else
it's sold I mean it's sold in a million
places but I really like this I'm
excited to wear it some more but both of
these are incredible if you're new to
perfume or you just haven't found you
like go smell these I think you're going
to be surprised by one of them if not
both they I've never gotten tired of
them every single other perfume I've had
I've gotten tired of like I loved
Flowerbomb got tired of it
I loved black opium I'm tired of it and
I'm only like this far the way through I
get so tired but these I've never tired
of the smell I love them so I think I
was 20 there were some that were like
all kind of clumped together as one even
though it was a couple separate again go
