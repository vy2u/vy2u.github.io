to do just a fun videos inspired by may
run touch of glam I saw that she
recently did a 100 layers of liquid
lipstick video and I wanted to do the
same but I wanted to challenge her and
I'm gonna try and do more than 100 I
just thought this would be fun so let's
go ahead and see what over 100 layers of
liquid lipstick looks like on the lips
I'm terrified okay here we go
this is literally the sloppiest I've
ever been I'm only three in we've got a
long ways to go let's kick it
it's starting to feel crazy we're almost
225
you
I already had big lips but I'm feeling
like crazy you got 50 on right now I'm
talking weird because I don't want to
mess it up you can see like where it's
starting to like pull off and dry and
like it's like really thick so it's I
presume it's going to be double this and
then some so we're gonna see I'm quickly
realizing that I have a bunch of these
bareMinerals ones they're not a very
thick liquid lipstick and neither are
these smashbox always on once but like
for example the Milani amore matte these
are amazing and they're like crazy
opaque this feels so weird as are the
colour-pop ones like I feel like I
should just have a ton of these because
they're crazy thick to really get this
amped up but I'm going through so I have
by the way 25 liquid lipsticks so I'm
just going through them in a cycle and
using all of them so let's go on
starting to get really crazy we're 75 in
and you can see where there's like
chunks from where it's tried and it's
illuminating hair that I have just like
peach fuzzer on my lips and it's making
me look like I have a mustache and I'm
trying not to laugh but it's the
funniest hair ever see because it's so
close to my lips it's like the weirdest
- it's also gross
you
you
okay so I legitimately just had to
answer the door with this on my lips
there's a package and I got the weirdest
look and I started to like explain and
I'm thinking how would anything that I'm
about to say make any sense to anyone so
I was just like hey you sign for that so
gross this is so girl it couldn't have
been like a not a brown shade it
couldn't have been a time when I had
like a nice berry on my lips let's keep
going
certain get real soft like it's not
going on cuz it's like no no more you
should know that while I'm doing this
I'm watching youtube videos on my phone
oh uh don't we all do that while we're
getting ready so my camera turned off
and I have no idea where I was
you
so we have 100 on now
we're gonna keep going I think I can
keep this going my lips just look super
defined like there's nothing wrong with
this look what you guys think and most
importantly this look is not going to go
anywhere unless I like literally take a
chiseling knock it off so you can see
here what I mean it's just really thick
on the sides trying to show you isn't
that gross we're going to keep going
though
look at my hands how are they that messy
Wow
we're gonna keep going i zoomed out cuz
I kept getting out of frame let's keep
it going this is great I think we can do
200 I really begin giving first evil
I always giggle when I watch tutorials
and people go and they look so adorable
cross-eyed and then I'm like and I
realized I don't know how to do cross
eyes so that's always what I'm doing
myself with my arm length hmm so I'm
super cool
we're at 150 should we try for 200 I
figure at this point we might as well
and side note I'm wearing pajama pants
and there is lip liquid lipstick
splatter all over them so I hope it
comes out I'm kind of thinking they
might not come out of course I'm wearing
pajama pants I look put together from
the waist up this is number 175 I am
here we are again with the brown one but
okay
175 shall we do 25 more and make it 200
I can t on top I can't leave this not
more on my teeth this is disgustingly
fun I am enjoying this more than I
probably should be I'm really thirsty
the home here we go last 35
I'm still thinking about that mailman
and how he musta done like what is on
her list is she okay
does she think that's cute I just I
would love to have been able to like
read his mind in that moment that was
the freakin funniest thing in the world
it is so thick when he's in you it look
at that let me show you from the side
I'm gonna let it dry and then see if we
can like peel it off so I tried killing
it off
it's just smeared everywhere mine's not
peeling there's a video I watched that
inspired this one where she did 100
layers and I will link her below she was
able to peel surburban off it was so
cool but mine's just kind of smearing
and I'd let it dry for a long time so um
I'm gonna get this off because my lips
are it's driving me absolutely bonkers
I've got it all over my hands my pants
my teeth it's just a mess but we did it
200 so hopefully you enjoyed this video
if you're curious about some of my other
Beauty videos here on my channel I just
recently tested out some drugstore
waterproof makeup in the water to see if
it's actually waterproof I had a lot of
fun making that video I will link that
below I'll also link some of my dupe
videos because I'm really big on finding
cheap versions of expensive makeup
product I hope that you'll stick around
and subscribe and I'll see you guys in
my next video hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
