have my best beauty of 2013 I'm not
really sure what I'm going to call this
but it's just all of my favourite
products from this past year they
weren't all necessarily released this
year in fact I don't know that any of
them were but they're just products that
over the past year I have just loved and
they kind of become like my go-to
products so I'm gonna go through every
single category and I wrote this all out
and it's like a really long list and
this might be a long video but hopefully
it will be helpful and fun for you to
watch and perhaps you'll start the new
year with some new ideas of some makeup
you might want to buy and try out so
we'll start with a face so one of the
first things I thought of was primer now
I don't use primer every single day but
when I do I always grab for this one
because I always like the look that it
gives my face when I use it and it is
the Smashbox photo finish primer this is
like a little trial size that I got in a
Smashbox like try it kit which was
really inexpensive it came with a lot of
stuff and I know that Ulta still sells
it so if I can find it I'll link it
below but that's a great way to get a
product like this which is really
expensive on its own but in a kit it's
usually pretty it's a pretty good deal
so I love it it's uh I think it's
silicone based it's got that feel to it
so you put it on your skin I don't use
it all the time because I feel like any
kind of primer really clogs my pores it
just makes me a little more prone to
breakouts but when I use it like tonight
is New Year's Eve so that's why I look
all glamazon I use this and I use it
tonight and it just in my makeup lasts
all day I love it okay so another face
favorite for foundation is my Revlon
Colorstay it's been my favorite forever
it might be my favorite forever and I
always get the normal to dry skin one
just because I noticed it really does my
skin deals better with that I used to
get the combo oily one and it really
dried my skin out so I really really
like this and I wear a lot of people ask
I wear the shade 150 buff and it seems
to work with my skinny around I'm
wearing it today most of these products
I'm wearing today there are my favorites
after all I figured I'd use I'd end the
year like with all my favorite products
wearing all of them okay so another face
product I just realized I don't have
these organized at all oh my gosh what
was I thinking
okay another face product that I love is
my Rimmel stay matte and this is my
favorite for powder I just love it and
again I've used this for years and I
still always reach for if I see a little
bit of oiliness I just grab for this
without a doubt I have to like force
myself to use other powders but this is
my favorite I've bought a million of
these and I started getting it in the
transparent shade just because then I
can wear it year-round and it doesn't
really matter but they do have a
different shade selection as well but I
usually just get transparent I love it
it's cheap too okay my favorite bronzer
this was tough because I've got a lot of
bronzer and I love a lot of different
ones for different reasons
but kind of across the board for whether
I'm just contouring or whether I'm
bronzing up my face which I don't do
that often I end up grabbing for this
more than anything and it's my benefit
bronzer the hoola bronzer it's a it is
expensive so that's another thing to
keep in mind there are so many great
drugstore turning the alternatives which
I own some but honestly I really like
this stuff better it stays on longer
it's a really it's a good shade for
really any skin type you guys know I'm
fair-skinned and it still works for me
and it works for darker skin yells too
so I love it it's to me it's worth the
money but it was sent to me from my
friend amber so um okay I have to blush
favorites and one is more expensive one
is more well it's really inexpensive my
expensive choice is from the balm it's
the down boy blush and a lot of people
talk about the other blushes from the
balm but this one is my favorite these
are a little pricier but if you get them
from Haute look you can get up like 10
bucks it's a really pretty paint color
I've got it on my cheeks now it doesn't
have any shimmer it stays on all day
it's incredibly pigmented
I mean if you can snag this from
hautelook for ten bucks get it cuz
you'll love it all their blushes are
good that this is my favorite cuz I just
liked pink on my skin tone um okay my
inexpensive favorite is this elf studio
blush and it's in the shade candid coral
and it's just this you know peach shade
again it's not shimmery I realized that
when I wear shimmery blushes it always
ends up splotchy on me for
reason and I still like them and I still
wear them but I ended up loving just
matte blushes or even just satin
finished blushes so candid corals my
favorite it's 3 bucks you can't beat
that
and all the elf studio blushes are
amazing okay um let's see
highlight this one's really cheap - so
you're gonna love me for that one it's
the wet and wild color icon bronzer it's
really a highlight shade for virtually
anyone I miss pale as you get and it's
still a highlight for me it's called
reserve your Cabana and it's just this
it's so perfect it's not really too
shimmery the swatch doesn't really show
it I have it on today it's not too
shimmery but it's just a little bit it's
just the perfect glow for everyday
whether you're going out with your going
to work when you're go to school it
doesn't really matter it never looks
like it's too much it's so perfect I
don't know how to describe this if
you've never swatched it or tried it
it's amazing and this thing is humongous
and it's like 3 or 4 bucks it's gonna
last me forever and it has SPF in it too
so it does expire I think I got like
eight more months so whatever anyway
okay is that all the face things I
wanted to talk about I think it might be
maybe the scan oh I have two favorite
face brushes one of them is this Sigma
f80 6 and as I was looking through my
brushes I was thinking what ones do I
use every single day without fail but I
almost never switch out and this is one
I've used every single day since I got
it I got it I think at the beginning of
the year I think my boy forgot it for me
for my birthday or for our anniversary
or something but it's f-86 and it's
pointed and I use it to blend in my
concealer or like by the liquid um like
highlighting concealer I use this and
it's just flawless every single time it
is flawless and I think this is my
favorite Sigma face brush ever I know
that it is just because I've never found
a brush that's this shape that says
dense as it is and as flawless when I
blend it with any concealer that I use I
just love it my other favorite face
brush is this Real Techniques powder
brush and it's real humongous and fluffy
pretty inexpensive you can get them at
Ulta um but it's just the perfect powder
brush and I reach for it every day I I
just love it I really really do love it
all of the Real Techniques
brushes are amazing but this is my
favorite okay on two eyes okay so oh I
forgot one thing hold on my favorite
concealer for face jeez Louise
is the Maybelline Dream Lumi
highlighting concealer this I had used
up a whole one and I didn't repurchase
it cuz I was like I need to go through
my concealers and I missed this terribly
so I finally rebaudiana Thor two ago and
I love it and I use it today it's just
so amazing and it blends in so well with
anything whether it's with a brush like
that f-86 or with your fingers you like
touch it and it just like melts into the
skin it is amazing
so certainly my favorite concealer it
conceals a bit I usually wear like a
concealer under it but because I don't
really know how to describe it would
conceal a little bit if you've got
really really dark circles you might
want to concealer under it that's what
I'm trying to say but it highlights so
well and just like I just love it anyway
okay now on to eyes I'm gonna start with
eyebrows my favorite favorite brow
product of the year is my Anastasia it's
just the brow powder and I use the duo
that's medium brown so it has this like
taupe shade and then it's got this
darker and it's perfect you can use the
darker one to just kind of get like the
to just what am I saying
to line like the bottom of it and then I
fill the rest in with the lighter one
and then I brush through it with like a
little spooley it's perfect it matches
so well and here's the thing if you're a
brunette or anyone that wants you know
like brown ish like a light brown
eyebrow but you don't want them to look
red this is for you I have searched the
world up and down looking for something
that doesn't kind of pull red on my
eyebrows because it makes me crazy and
this this is was my answer
I will we rebuy this again and again and
again it is amazing but frankly it's
lasted me like forever and I still
haven't hit pan and I use every single
day I love it okay so let's see let's go
with well we'll do like shadow primer my
favorite eyeshadow primer this year
which blew my mind was the Fergie the
wet and wild by Fergie what do they call
it the take on the day I shadow primer
it's pretty inexpensive around 5 bucks
it comes with a ton of product and it's
just
it's the kind that just it's liquid and
it comes out through a little spout
there I just like it it cancels out any
veining for the most part and it's just
it holds on to the channel all day it's
cheap I mean really in the realm of
eyeshadow primers most of them are good
unless you have really really oily
eyelids for anyone else you know you can
really use any of them and they work but
I really do like this and I think even
if you have oily lids I think it would
still work for you I don't know then
again you might want to use more of like
a creamy based one but I really like it
okay
speaking of creamy this is my favorite
cream shadow it's the benefit cream
creaseless cream shadow whatever it's
called in RSVP and this is actually a
little trial thing that came in one of
their little um palettes but it is the
prettiest like on Transpo it's like a
kind of pinkish champagne and it really
is just I don't know if you guys can
even see that I have it on again today
like I said most of these are on my face
but I just like it it's and usually I
don't like pink type colors on my eyes
but I just love this and it looks pretty
on its own just like a wash of color or
you can use it under shadows which is
what I did today and I just really like
it it stays on and it's kind of like
it's lighter than most of the cream
shadows that I have like it's almost
like a thinner consistency but I kind of
like it so love that one all right we'll
start with I'm sorry I feel so like
there's just so much to talk about I
feel lost okay we're gonna start with
eye shadow now my favorite single eye
shadow of the year is the wet-and-wild
brulee it's one of their little singles
that they sell for a dollar ninety-nine
and it's just the nude it's just like a
matte nude color I mean that's pretty
much it the reason I love it is because
I use it to blend all my shadows
together all the time
now it almost works to kind of help
mattifies shimmery shadows not all the
way but a little bit kind of tones it
down it also helps tone down if you've
got a lot of darkness going on and you
want to kind of lighten it up it also
just works to just melt the colors
together so it doesn't look like stripes
on your eyes you know it's just perfect
it really is perfect and like I said
it's matte so it doesn't add any shimmer
or anything like that to your eyelids
gosh it's so cheap okay so my favorite
small palette like quad or anything like
that is my son
it's a six pan palace on a quad but it's
in the perfectly neutral number ten I
palette and I love it because there none
of them are crazy shimmery it's perfect
to travel with because you've got some
deeper colors and you have lighter and
then everything in between if you're a
neutrals girl you'd love this and you'd
use the heck out of it because none of
them are too shimmery or to anything
it's just it really is perfect and it's
got cooler colors and warmer colors and
I might've said that backwards but I
just love it I really really do love
this and I end up traveling with this
all the time because it kind of covers
everything I'm in need really for a
neutral eyes so I love it
and if you Sonia Kashuk you can buy it
at Target okay I have two favorite like
bigger palettes one is more expensive
one is cheaper you're welcome and it's
so my cheaper palette that I love is my
wet and wild comfort zone palette this
these are only like 5 or 6 bucks however
much but it's just it's perfect I've had
it for like a million years and I still
just love it I use all the colors for
the most part except for these deep deep
colors I don't use but it's it's just
the best I almost don't even know what
to say about it my favorite color is
this like olive green color here that's
it there it's just like a pretty
metallic I use it as a crease color all
the time I I just love this palette I
can't say enough if I ever lost it I'd
rebuy it if I ever use it up I'd rebuy
it I just it's one of my favorites I
reach for it all the time ok my
expensive choice for palette is the
Naked 2 and I think I can't decide
whether I like the naked the original
Naked palette or the Naked 2 better I
don't own the naked 3 there pink shades
and I really I just don't wear pink
shades on my lids so it's probably not
one that I'm gonna buy anytime soon but
the naked 2 I think I've decided that I
like more because they're all bronzy
colors you know and at the end of the
day I just did I just say bronzy colors
I meant taupe colors bronze is like the
original naked about those are all kind
of bronzy these are all taupe shades and
I end up reaching for taupe sand olive
greens and colors like that more than I
reach for anything and I end up liking
the way it looks best on my eyes so and
it has I love that both the naked one
and the Naked 2 have half baked the gold
shade that
just love because that's what I wear oh
my gosh all the time so I think I've
decided I like the naked two better than
the original naked but it's so hard
because there's so many shadows I love
it all so I guess I don't have to really
decide do I okay so those are all my
shadow picks now we're gonna move on to
eyeliner dude there's a lot here too
okay so for my favorite pencil liner
it's got to go to my Jordana 12-hour
made to last eyeliners these are all the
kind you have to sharpen they're not
retractable but I have it in three
different shades I had a video review of
all these where I talk about these
extensively they're like three bucks at
Walgreens and they are the most I'll do
the blue one because the ruin is just
absolutely gorgeous these are the most
pigmented they don't move all day they
oh my gosh they're amazing and they're
so creamy they are just the same as the
Urban Decay 24/7 pencils or any of the
other pencils that are just like glide
II you know what I mean the NYX slide on
pencils but these are three bucks and
they have so many different colors the
black one is the shortest one cuz I've
clearly been using it but they're
amazing you can wear them on their own
if you're it's just hard to describe
these I love them so much if you have a
Walgreens near you go and buy just one
and try it out and you will fall in love
and you want all the colors because
they're amazing okay um my favorite
liquid liner is my position formula eye
booster when it comes in this little
silver tube it's got one of these you
know really really thin point but it's
flexible and it's just it's just my
favorite because you can really get in
there and get in the corners and just
get deep into the lashes you can get
everywhere you need to get it also
claims to have like um like it boosts
your lash growth I don't know about that
but I do know that I love it as an
eyeliner I've never I will say though I
should say this I never wear liquid
eyeliner alone I usually wear on top of
another eyeliner just to kind of like
set it even more and make it even
blacker so I really don't know how this
works on its own because I don't wear
liquid eyeliner alone so if you know if
you use this alone and you like it or
you don't like it tell me below cuz I'm
I am curious about that um okay my
favorite cream or gel eyeliner is my
L'Oreal what is it it's called the
lacquer liner 24 hour and this last 24
hours
I slept in a few times this year I'm
actually really good about taking my
makeup off but a few times I fell asleep
with my makeup on I woke up in the
morning and my liner was perfect I was
like oh my gosh I could just go back out
and face the day it's so funny this is
almost gone it's amazing it comes to the
brush it's actually pretty good I now
use another one because I ended up
ruining the other one so um I love it
it's under ten bucks I'm sure I and when
it runs out I'll probably rebuy it
because I really do I like it better
than any other one that I've tried it
does not budge once you put it on it's
amazing okay those are all the liners so
now on to mascara I'm going to surprise
you guys with my mascara pick and the
reason I say that is because I think
I've only talked about this once and
there have been a few mascaras this year
that I've talked about that I said oh my
gosh I love this so much but this one
hasn't been one I don't even know if I I
think I've talked about at least once
but I can't even find it in stores so
that is a little bit problematic you let
me know where you've seen it if you've
seen this in stores this is the Rimmel
scandaleyes retro glam mascara I got
this in an influenster voxbox and it was
a new product and since then I've got
our sisters and looked and I can't find
it and I'm freaking out a little bit
because it's the best mascara I've ever
used in my life and I'm not I'm not even
exaggerating
I'm not even apologize for it it is
amazing okay I'm gonna gush so first of
all the opening is humongous I was like
why is it so big but the brush is
humongous but the brush is shaped kind
of like like an hourglass shape but the
there's something about the fact that I
can like it's the package I don't know
there's something about this and my
lashes are just the seats not doing it
any justice on the camera are the best
they've ever been I love this mascara I
put it on they stay curled all day
there's no flaking nothing I have
nothing to complain about it doesn't
clump when I put it on I know that I can
put on one eye you guys if you see it
buy it I'm telling you you will thank me
times a million I just spit over that it
was worth it it's so good okay okay on
to lips yes oh wait you know I'll do my
favorite eye brushes okay I have to this
is the Sigma e-40 I've had this forever
before
I think I got it like in a makeup swap
like before I ever started YouTube or
anything it was my first Sigma brush and
I was like this is amazing
and it really was it's just a really
kind of bushy humungous I brush but I
use it with that wet wild little Brule
to mix everything together and it's
perfect I love this brush I end up
bringing it with me every time I leave
the house I just every time I travel not
every time I leave I love it I love it I
love it I love it my other one is only a
dollar it's the elf defining eye brush
and I use this one before the crease no
for the outer corner in the crease so
like right here when I'm doing like a
darker shade there and I want to kind of
blend it out in the outer V this is
perfect cuz it does have that little bit
of a angle and it's a dollar
let me did I say the name the defining
eye brush the elf essentials line what
sorry the Lightning's eating weird cuz
it's getting really dark in here sorry
okay hmm my favorite tool and this isn't
really a tool kind of this is the elf
makeup remover pen it has makeup remover
liquid in it if you get you know
anything up here from mascara if you've
got liner in the way you just use it and
then just wipe it off I've had this for
a year it hasn't dried out or anything
three bucks it's amazing I need to buy a
bunch and have them like in my purse and
just everywhere cuz I love it okay for
lips my favorite lip balm is the
Vaseline lip therapy in any of the kinds
I tried the cocoa butter and I loved it
this one I just started cuz my friend
Amy sent it to me and it's the Rose one
um it just it's like so moisturizing for
your lips and when you first put it on
it's kind of weird but then after about
20 seconds it's like perfect it just
like melts into yours I don't even know
how to describe it and it's not just
Vaseline I think some people think it's
just Vaseline it has a little bit more
to it it's definitely a little bit
different of a consistency but I love it
okay okay onto lipstick Sonia Kashuk
satin luxe lip color and this is in the
shade rosette I like all of them I
really just love the formula rosette is
my favorite shade in the line that I own
it's just it's what I'm wearing now and
I just love it and I get a lot of
compliments in person on it I just
I love it okay and for lipgloss my
favorite and it always has been is my
NYX lip gloss in beige and it does smell
like cherry so if you don't like
cherries you'll hate this but it's
amazing and it's just the perfect
it's called beige but it's the perfect
paint color and it's just the perfect
consistency it wears off nicely
it's just perfect and the packaging is
adorable look at the little bow on top
and these are like five bucks I think
can you see the little bow i don'ts
probably not show through okay I got a
pile of makeup now on my bed so that
those are all my favorites for this
entire year it was so fun to go through
and pick it wasn't that hard though I
will say that it was fun it was really
easy to say mm that was definitely my
favorite so I hope that was fun if you
haven't if you're curious about some of
my makeup fails I posted a video as a
collab with my friend Jordan I'll link
it below
they were kind of my products I regret
buying or crap makeup things that I just
wish I hadn't spent money on they just
products I really didn't like so I'll
link that below as well and that's kind
of it really is kind of my fails of 2013
if you think about it maybe I'll
retitled it that I don't know anyway but
I hope that was informative and fun to
watch and I'll catch you guys in the new
year bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
