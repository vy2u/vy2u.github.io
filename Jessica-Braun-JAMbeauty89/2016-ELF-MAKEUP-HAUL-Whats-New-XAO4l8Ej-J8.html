going to share with you a huge elf haul
and I put in quotes as I always explain
because elf sent all of this to me they
send a lot of people here on YouTube
boxes of their new products which is
great because I get to share it with you
guys
I've loved out for a long time this
video is not sponsored I don't have to
show it in fact I don't always show what
they send but there were so many new
really cool things that I was like ok I
really want to share this stuff with you
guys so if you're interested just keep
watching so the first thing that stood
out to me was the thing I have had my
eye on and I was planning on buying and
then they sent it to me I was like well
that worked out it is their new
illuminating palette so it's got classic
elf packaging but it has four different
highlighting shades it looks like they
got kind of a kind of yellow tongue
whitish one they've got kind of a
champagne pinkish one Wow and then they
have kind of a one that would be my
favorite I'll show you I'll show myself
swatching it if I can
right there it's kind of more of a
neutral nude color um and then they have
this kind of more oranjee bronze color
and I'll swatch that right there yeah so
these will look like they kick up a
little bit of power which that doesn't
really matter if you're using a good
brush you know where you're putting it
but um you know with highlighter it's
something you have to be careful with
because you don't want to just throw it
on and then have it all the way up here
and you know just everywhere you don't
want it um but these look really really
nice so far I'm excited to play around
with this I love that all four shades
really are pretty different and that I
am very excited about because I feel
like I don't know I've just I've been
waiting for a drugstore priced brand to
come out with something that can compete
with all of the highlighting things that
are out there and this definitely is
awesome they also have these new liner
and brow creams I think they're just you
know supposed to be similar to the UM
you dip ground all those things I
usually just use a pencil for my eyes
I've messed around with some like this
but um I'm not a big fan of this format
for my brows but I know a lot of you
guys are so they have espresso which is
like this really deep brown they have
medium brown which should probably be
what I would use then they have light
brown which looks a little more reddish
tinted compared to the medium brown so
if you don't want that your brows to
pull red which I don't like that either
I would go with the medium brown but if
you like that or maybe of auburn hair
then you might want the light brown and
then the other one they sent was taupe
blonde now this is a true taupe because
I feel like a lot of the taupe ones I've
used are more Brown which I like but
this one is truly lighter so it's a true
taupe like I said and I'm going to open
the medium brown one since that's one I
would probably really use I want to show
you what the packaging looks like so
it's just their standard little pot they
have like cream shadows that come in
this but it's got a black lid which i
think is cute and let's see oh it feels
really waxy which is good but it's got a
lot of color so that can be good or bad
depending I think that's a good thing
because if you're using this format you
probably are used to that but it seems
to blend out pretty well so if you're
using a spoolie to brush through your
brows that'd be helpful um but maybe I
mean you know I certainly will try it
I will try any of this kind of stuff at
least a couple times no say once but
usually you need to try more than one
hey you
so that is Isis okona thing I was
wondering if it came with like a little
brush or anything but it does not come
with the brush it's just a pot so you
wouldn't need a separate little thing
elf cells little angled brushes that
would be perfect for that they also have
these new lip kits balms and they sent
me eight saves and they look really cute
they're just I'll open let me see which
one do I want I kind of open this one
because it looks kind of like new dish
and I'm just curious about what it
actually looks like so I'm assuming if
they're truly like a baby lips kind of a
bomb that they may be a little bit
glossy but not crazy glossy they'll have
a little bit of color I like the
packaging I like that it's this
see-through and then just the white it's
the kind that it's already above the
things you want to be careful with it
but this one is in it truly is balmy
it's not
it's like creamy as I thought this one's
in bear kiss that seems really really
pretty this would be the perfect kind of
thing to have in your purse because you
don't really need to think about you can
throw it on you know maybe check in the
mirror really quickly but you're not
worried about it going everywhere and as
you're wearing it like I get really
self-conscious when I'm talking to
people like whether it's at work or
wherever when I'm talking to people and
I'm wearing it really bold if I'm
constantly thinking like running outside
my lip line do I look crazy like does it
look dry but something like this you
never have to really think about that I
want to open a couple more just to see
kind of the this one looks like a really
bright one it's called XO red that makes
me think of Beyonce song XO and Taylor
Swift song red mixed together sounds
awesome I like books fish sauce John
Mayer did a cover of that song XO by
Beyonce if you've never heard it it's
beautiful you should absolutely look it
up so this one it looks really red but
since it's a bomb I'm sure it won't be
oh wow
I'll be honest I wouldn't like this
because that sounds terrible I'm not
trying to be negative I love I love a
lot of this stuff but when I wanting a
red lip I want to be very like I
mentioned I want to be really precise
and so anything that looks like a wash
of red on me looks terrible it looks
amazing there was someone I was watching
earlier today on YouTube I can't
remember if it was but she had like a
glossy red and on me it wasn't terrible
it looked gorgeous on her
so it really just depends on what you
like and what looks good on you this
would look great on a lot of people just
not on me but that's really cool though
because it seems that they really kind
of runs the gamut up it can do a light
wash or color let's do one more let's do
like a berry tone this one is called
very sweet Oh has so many makeup
products is crazy I was just thinking
about like when I'm on their side I'm
like this is too much like it's so
overwhelming because they have so much
it's like where you even begin when I
first heard of elf I remember going to
the side and feeling overwhelmed and
that's when I started looking it up on
YouTube and I was like okay so I could
start funneling like what is good from
what's bad because there are some
products I do not like for mill ok so
this is very sweet it is like a berry
but again it packs some punch to it but
you could probably take your hand and
just kind of yeah you can kind of rub it
in and make it a little less punchy so
the other change they have is pouty
raspberry they have kissing coral pucker
pink and then two more oh this one this
is smoochy spice and then this one is
flirty and perky pink so lots of pinky
tones but they have a you know a little
bit of a range there I think these are
cute these are inexpensive I mean even
more inexpensive than baby lips and you
know they seem pretty nice so I'll have
to actually try them out and get back to
you guys on that maybe I'll even do a
lip swatch video if you would be
interested in the lip swatch video of
all age shades let me know because I I
actually really like doing lip swatch
videos and I've done quite a lot of them
and speaking of that kind of perfectly
segues into the next thing they now have
a lip color remover it is I am so
excited I've never actually tried a lip
color remover I usually just use like a
makeup wipe and I feel like it just dry
it mommy my lips get so dry after swatch
videos but even for everyday like if I
were a really red lip I swear my lips
are red for like another day after that
no matter if I shower wash my face
whatever so this it's just a clear
squeezy to hide it has a smell not
really though oh well just put it on my
lips if your wonder when I'm wearing on
my lips today by the way I am wearing a
lipgloss from NYX called beige it's one
of my favorites I've had it for years
and years I just bought a new one
because I it is one of my parrot lip
glosses so comfortable it does have a
strong smell but um I love it and I
realized I don't worn just lip gloss in
forever so I was like I always line my
lips and put lipstick on and maybe put
gloss on maybe not but I was like
remember when I used to just wear lip
gloss so I'm like kicking in old school
and just just wearing lip gloss oh they
also have this huge now they I remember
when I first learned about they had tons
of eye shadow palette face
do this one is called their artistry
eyeshadow palette and it came in this
like pouch which i think is kind of cool
fits perfectly in there got standard
black elf packaging which I actually
like and it reminds me of like those
Urban Decay palettes that are out like
especially with the color choices so
let's swatch some of these while i comes
with the dual ended brush and i actually
do like many of their brushes not all
but many let's watch like this blue one
let's watch this like burgundy well this
one feels crazy soft that burgundy feels
really really soft let's do like a
neutral brown see if those are any good
to today and one of us see this like
yellowish color here so i mean wow
now these aren't necessarily colors i
wear every day but there
look how powdery though they kick up a
lot of dust so that's something again
and keep in mind you might get a lot of
fog you want to be sure to not wipe it
with your finger because then it'll
smoosh it right into your skin take a
you know maybe a powder brush and just
whisk it away some people you know you
can use those like guards underneath i
don't mess with that but just a brush
usually does the trick a big fluffy one
so they're really powdery but there's a
big color selection and they're crazy
pigmented and usually elf shadows blend
pretty well as well so once you get it
going it'll blend decently well do i
think they're as good as like two-faced
shadows not quite but they're still
really really nice and frankly elf has
better shadows than a lot of just the
standard drugstore brands that are out
there anyway can you guys hear that
it either sounds like there are 15 dogs
barking outside or there's like geese
like yelling it's the weirdest I you
probably can't hear it's just weird kind
of alarming like I don't I don't see
anything weird there's some people
moving in but anyway so they also have
four new brushes and I really do light
elfs brushes especially the studio line
the ones that are a dollar it's kind of
hit or miss
some of them are okay some of them are
terrible so you really it is hit or miss
but for the most part the studio line
which is a couple dollars more they're
pretty darn good quality so this one is
called their sculpting face brush and
it's got like kind of this dip in it
and it's really really soft and you know
you could dip it in a contour whether
it's you could do with this kind of a
brush you could do both like liquid and
cream or powder but you dip it in your
contour shade you can kind of Pat it in
and then rub it you can even get up here
if you wanted to use it to kind of
bronze slash contour as well feels
really soft I love that interesting
shape I will definitely try that out
because I love that kind of a brush and
I like that it's a little softer I've
had some like this that are really
really dense that you almost can't move
the powder with it or the green for that
matter this one is called I'm smiling at
the name called selfie ready powder
blurring brush so it's a little bit
denser for a powder brush it's like thin
this way and thicker that way and again
it's really soft but I'm trying to
figure out it actually the fact that
it's I just spit everywhere the fact
that it's really thin I feel like you
could really quickly go down the bridge
of your nose with the light powder and
up here and maybe get your philtrum in
your chin um I mean I'll certainly try
this this again you could totally use
the contour you may be for blush it's
just a little dense for that like for
what I like for blush but that's pretty
cool the next thing is this selfie ready
Foundation blurring brush so the other
was a powder brush this one's a
foundation brush and again it's it's a
little bit thinner so now this one's
more just round but it's dense again but
it's kind of tapered whereas I feel like
a lot of foundation brushes are either
flat or they're almost all the same
length all the way around but this one's
a little more tapered so I actually
think that might be nice I might try
this out over the next couple days and
see how I like it because I I would I
think I would really like that brush we
will see and the last brush is this
flawless face brush and while I'm trying
to open this another brush I really like
from elf is their powder brush it's like
a flat black
you can use it for foundation it's so
soft okay so this one is tapered as well
thin than fat but even more tapered and
a little more tall and a lot more
flexible it's not as dense so that I
feel like I would really like for blush
that's not right up my alley when it
comes because I can get the blush shade
just kind of on to the side of it
tap it and just go blue and it's pretty
much perfect so awesome brushes they're
really soft they're kind of they're more
well made brushes the next thing is this
elf on the spot blocked and it says
they're mattifying blotting papers let's
see I'm not I never really bring
blotting papers with me because frankly
I don't use them but this is like an
actual little holder for it I like that
Oh what okay so it comes with this
little sponge on top and you can like
put your finger through it but then
there's this white thing I don't know if
it's sticky but there's the blotting
papers are in here so I don't know if
you like like is this sticky and you
like peel it off and then the blotting
papers stick to it that's right okay I
just peeled off and it does feel a
little sticky so let's try it I'm okay I
got to show you that that was cool so
there's a little mirror here which i
think is perfect for blotting paper so
I'm just kind of putting the sticky side
in and it picks one up and then well
this is certainly easier to use than
blotting paper on its own got a little
of that gloss um I'm not super-dee-duper
oily right now so does this stay sticky
like or do I put this back on it maybe
I'll put it back on it I bet I can just
set it right in there and it'll stick to
the next one and then I can just peel it
up but in the meantime we put that back
on that's actually really useful Thank
You elf because I feel like I never use
the blotting papers because I'm like
like trying to hold it in and I'm like
it's all crinkled I don't know
I'm really
about that kind of stuff but that
actually seems really useful and clearly
really well thought out so and I like
that it's not going to get all ripped up
because usually like I've had the
Palladio rice paper ones and those are
nice but they're in that little like
cardboard packaging and it gets all
ripped up and grow so then I'm like you
I don't want to look at that before the
next thing are three new shades of their
matte lip colors now I've done an entire
swatch video of all the matte lip colors
I've tried I only get right out there
for you or down below but so they have
three new ones I will swatch all three
of these for you guys because I the
matte lip colors are great they're not
100% matte but they're really really
nice they do not move and the way
they're shapes you can really have a lot
of control like for your lip shape for
me like my lips are big but they're kind
of weird in spots so I feel like if I
don't have them lined especially if I'm
wearing like a bright color or dark
color it just looks weird so these kind
of are like a two-in-one they line it
and fill it in so this one is in did I
already say it Rowdy Rouge looks like
kind of a reddish orange I love these
and they're so pigmented so that's Rowdy
Rouge that's a very Taylor swifty I'm
all about Taylor Swift today everyday
what am I talking about alright this one
mulberry maven this looks like a kind of
very wine kind of color which is one of
my favorite kinds of shades to wear and
one of my favorite matte lip colors is
in want oh I like this this is a true
berry like purple so I cannot lie to you
it really is purple so if you don't like
that kind of a thing then stay away from
this shade but it really is like a
purpley color which I really like that
is so beautiful
and by the way the back of these have a
little sharpener so I say sharpener it's
not real but you just take it and it'll
shape your tips so you can consistently
have it kind of like that angled thing
so you can learn with it so the last new
color is in scarlet Knight and it looks
really really dark okay this might be a
new favorite because it's not as purpley
at all and I know the camera never does
it justice the way it is in person but
it's got more of a raisin tint to it it
looks absolutely
it's not so dark that you look weird I
don't think that is awesome oh I'm
excited about these I love these so much
the next new things they have are new
lip exfoliator I've had the regular lip
exfoliator and in the past I didn't like
that because it would wear off weird and
so all you were left with was the gritty
stuff and there was no ball around it
and so then other people said I'll just
do it and then you guys gave me a lot of
awesome tips so I ended up I now kind of
liked it because I figured out how to
use it but now they have ones that are
mint maniac and sweet cherry
so I'm wondering especially the mint one
I would really like that cherry one I
might pass that on to a sister because
cherry I don't love the scent but I
don't hate it I'm just kind of torn but
oh it's broken I hate when that happens
um but it doesn't feel exfoliating oh
there it goes so once you get past the
initial layer it looks just like a bomb
but it does have like really tiny little
granules that exfoliate to Harn remember
I kind of melt that end back into there
but the sweet cherry would be just like
a lighter pink there's no actual color
to it but it smells like mint
so last things in here are these like
setting sprays and I used to have the
regular mist and set it was the first
setting spray I ever owned like four or
five years ago before I had a channel
more now yeah very but it smelled like
milk I am very like nostalgic feelings
about their mists and sex phrase but I
remember at that time it smelled like
milk and it made me just feel sick to my
stomach but they have an illuminating
one now and they have a Matt magic
misted set so this makes me think of
like the NYX ones where they have the
matte one and then they have the dewy
one and Urban Decay does too I think but
it's just their standard packaging just
the black so I mean I will certainly try
these out I already have a setting spray
out so I don't want to like spray even
more but I will definitely try these out
I think the illuminating would be great
for if you've got you know a really
powdery skin or maybe you just have dry
skin and no matter what you end up just
looking really cakey the illuminating
woman be for you the mountain would be
great if you have
the oily skin or maybe you're just kind
of in-between and you just want to kind
of tone it down a little bit more that'd
be great
or in the summer the matte one and in
the winter the illuminating one so those
are all of the new products that elf has
out right now that I know of I will link
all of them below as I stated earlier
and I have an entire playlist of like
elf videos so I will link that below
because I do a lot of elf reviews a lot
of else swatches and how to's and things
like that here so if you like out then
this is a channel for you but if you
also just like makeup I think you like
my channel I don't know maybe so I hope
that you will subscribe and I'll catch
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
