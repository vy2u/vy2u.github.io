deuced video I've been planning this
video for a few months I've done quite a
few dupes videos on my channel but I
always like to take my time and be
really thoughtful about them so I will
link my past-due videos below but if you
don't know how to do this basically a
cheaper version of a more expensive
product sometimes it's a dupe because of
the shade sometimes it's a dupe because
of the formula so for this I've got a
really solid mix of dupes here almost an
entire face worth half of my face today
is drugstore makeup and half of it is
high-end while I'm explaining these
products and sharing their prices etc I
will be showing you me applying them at
the same time so that way you can really
see them in action and you'll also get
to see how they last throughout the day
because I'll be doing check-ins at the
end of this video throughout my day
today it's 12:30 3 right now my time not
that it matters you're watching this
whatever you're watching it but anyway
it's 12:30 3 here and I'm going to be
going out we're going to go shopping we
might go out to dinner tonight so I'm
going to be checking into Reza day so
you can see how both of them are wearing
as well so if you're interested in that
portion of this definitely stay tuned to
the end of the video before we go
farther I hope that you'll subscribe and
stick around I love doing drugstore and
high-end videos on my channel let's go
ahead and get into it so I'm going to
give you a second make a guess go
comment below which eye do you think is
high-end and which side do you think is
drugstore I'll give you a second ok no
cheating you can't just fast-forward and
buy stuff let's start with what I
started with today which was primer I
have found a dupe for the Smashbox photo
finish foundation primer this retails
for $42 and
and as you watch me apply these they are
very similar consistency kind of a light
blue almost gel like primer and the next
one however is only $14 you're saving a
ton of money and the next one actually
comes with 1.05 ounces where the
Smashbox ones come one comes with one
ounce so you get a little bit more not
that that's that big of a difference but
you get more for way cheaper
they're so hydrating for me I've got I
would say normal to dry skin dry and the
whites are kind of normal right now but
I do still get a little bit of dry skin
sometimes around my eyes on my nose up
here in my really my t-zone region so
these are a lifesaver for me because I
can put
moisturizer on and then put these on and
I just feel like it helps my foundation
stay pull it but also hydrated so it's
not looking all cracked and gross
throughout the day and obviously now
that you've seen the first one you know
that this side of my face is the high
end this side is drugstore so let's keep
going for foundation I just applied my
covergirl vitalists healthy elixir on
all of my face I'm doing a review today
so stay tuned for that if you're
interested but that's what's on my face
currently and I use my little ended up
using my flower Beauty sponge which I
love this is not a dupe or anything
these are just although totally like
Beauty Blender status this is like crazy
nice so anyway regardless that's what I
have on my face if you are curious my
next dupe I'm very excited about one of
my favorite high-end products is the
Bobbi Brown corrector and I use the
shade like this this is $27 and it's
just a really peachy shade that I like
to put on my inner corner and it just
kind of brightens the area I just read
of some dark circles right just like it
it's a very emollient but not too a
wholly --nt concealer so it actually
stays in place well I recently picked up
the pixi by petra which you can find it
Target and online it's their correction
concentrate and brightening peach now I
do think there's a tiny bit of a shade
difference of course the Bobbi Brown
ones come in a bunch of shades the pixie
ones only come in a couple but these are
pretty close so I should watch me apply
them when I put the pixie one on I do
feel like the pixie one doesn't blend as
easily as the Bobbi Brown one and I'm
sure that's a formula difference but the
pixie one is $12 verses 27 and the 61
comes with 3 grams whereas the Bobbi
Brown only comes with 1.4 so you're
getting more than double the amount for
more than half the price so for less
than half the price more than half you
don't I mean it's happened a little bit
more oh my gosh anyway so I'm thinking
even though it is a little bit harder to
work with it's still not hard to work
with so when I'm comparing them I just
think to myself I mean really you're
getting even more and it's the same
after effect and I would just add that I
think the pixie ones a little tiny bit
thicker and that's why it's a little bit
harder to blend in I do find that my
fingers do the best job with both
products at blending them in versus a
sponge or a brush I do
feel like it sinks in just a little bit
more flawlessly so the next one is one
of my favorite products again this is
the laura mercier secret brightening
powder and this is $26 you get four
grams you do get a good amount of
product for an under eye setting powder
in my opinion it is smaller than like
the traditional Laura Mercier powder
that I also love this is mostly use
under your eye typically over concealer
it helps to set your concealer so that
it doesn't crease as much and that it
stays in place but also it helps
brighten the areas it kind of multi uses
in that way well else have their HD
under eye setting powder out for a long
time this is three dollars versus twenty
six now I was trying to find how many
grams because it doesn't say on here and
it doesn't say on their website but I
would bet that it's maybe one or two
grams no more than that so you are
getting more product with this but for
three dollars it's not enough more that
it makes the price jump orbit because
these are very very similar they're both
incredibly finely mill you can see as I
apply them they really do have the same
effect as I look at myself in the
viewfinder I don't feel like I can see a
noticeable difference enough to pay for
this again when I run out that makes
sense
but I do really love it I think that the
elf one I used to not like because it
used to have like this very very visible
shimmer but I don't know if they've
gotten rid of the shimmer or they've
made it more finely milled because you
can't see it anymore these both do I
don't want to say they have a glitter in
them because they don't they do have
like this kind of quality to them to
where it does almost look just a little
bit glimmery and I think that's where
the brightening effect comes from but it
also sets that area really well I love
both of these I don't think you can go
wrong either way I think that the Laura
Mercier one might be a little bit more
of a pure white so if you are really
really looking to brighten that might be
just a pinch bit more brightening but
it's very it's not super obvious my next
one I'm super excited about and okay
slow down just so this is the Too Faced
milk chocolate Soleil bronzer this is
their lighter version of their chocolate
Soleil I kind of balance between I think
I've gotten rid of this before and then
I they sent it to me again so I tried it
again and I was like you know what right
now my skin you know my skin is usually
pretty fair and it does work pretty well
these smell like chocolate
they the packaging is adorable you know
pretty nice so people loved it people
loved the chocolates away as well well I
had fallen in love with this number
seven bronzer which by the way this is
now sold at Ulta so if you haven't been
able to find it because I bought mine
previously at Target don't install two
Ulta so I'll link that below but this is
their bronzer in the shade golden sand
now when you look at these these are
pretty close but I do think it looks
maybe like this one's a little bit more
warm I can't even tell they look the
exact same on the skin so as you can see
as I'm applying it here that they really
look the same they're both a they're
both a great option if you do have more
fair-skinned
now of course to face in number 7 both
have different shades so I don't know
how similar they are you know going back
and forth with the shades but I do know
that the formula is very very similar
it's not a crazy pigmented product
neither one of them but for me it's just
the right amount that I can't screw it
up because some bronzers are so
pigmented that you're just like oh my
gosh you put it on and you're like great
now my skin is ruined because I put like
a huge patch here and nothing here well
this is really foolproof so if you're
like me and you're not a professional
you would love these bronzers I just
tried to swatch them it you can barely
see them in swatches so it's not even
worth chewing because they really are
meant to be applied with the brush so
the Too Faced one is $30 the number-7
one is all 99 so it's one of those
things that you're paying again half the
price and you're getting really I
actually think the number-7 packaging
might be prettier because there's
beautiful design on the actual bronzer
and then it's just so pretty so it's
kind of like wow you're paying out the
price but you almost feel like you're
getting a nicer product so my next
product is blush and for this one I have
fallen in love with the Mac blush and
Melba it's truly a classic from Mac at
the classic shade so many people love
and uses so many makeup artists and I
get why it's just a beautiful peach
these are really pigmented but they also
blend really nicely so I had tried the
number 7 again it's their powder blush
and peach velvet and when I first looked
at them and when you see the swatch
peach velvet looks just a little bit I
don't want to say more pigmented just a
little bit deeper but when I apply it
with a brush it looks exactly the same
are both very similar formulas just very
similar staying powder as you'll see as
I check in throughout the day I am sure
and just very very similar colors so if
you've been dying to try Mac Melba and
you don't want to spend 23 dollars you
can spend $12.99 a little bit more than
half and get a very very similar blush
they even have similar packaging you
know what I mean actually I think the
number 7 was just a little bit thinner
so very similar look both in the actual
product and in the packaging but of
course you're saving like 10 bucks so
the next product is a very trendy right
now product and I'm pretty sure it's
limited edition but I was going to check
but I just looked at the product on
Spore and I didn't see that it says
limited edition anyway but I'm almost
positive it is regardless it's their
shimmering skin perfecter pressed in
prismatic amethyst and you can see why
it's really trendy it's like this
lavender very holographic kind of a
highlighter and of course I'm wearing it
today this cost $38 and I love Becca
highlighters but they are very pricy and
there are so many amazing highlighters
in the drugstore you can get them for
really cheap you don't have to pay that
much well I recently found the brand
models own at Ulta and I did a whole
video on a bunch of their products some
are great some where terrible I will
link that video below if you're
interested because they're all pretty
affordable products it's not a high-end
brand it's more of a drugstore brand
anyway I found this highlighter in peach
pearl and these swatch the same they
look the same on the face they're very
kind of peach pearl is an interesting
name because they really are kind of
peachy but also purpley they're really
just this really cool highlighter that I
really haven't seen done by any other
company so this cost only $11.99 versus
38 so you're getting a way better deal
and highlight or something that unless
using the same one every day for years
you're probably not going to run out of
anytime soon I would say that maybe
maybe the model Zone one pulls a little
bit lighter but they're so so similar
and you can't tell the difference on the
skin and if you want to try that kind of
fun new highlighter look but you don't
want to spend $40 on it I would say
definitely try the model zone it's very
creamy the packaging is cute I love the
design on the actual powder awesome so
the next dupe that I do
today what they do for this really
expensive $80 eyeshadow palette it's the
visor or V czar I've heard so many
people say it different ways but it's
their neutral matte eyeshadow palette
this has 12 different shades all that
all very neutral and when I came across
this hard-candy palette which is $10 at
war and they finally have it available
online I talked about this in some video
and like it wasn't available yet and a
lot of you guys are like no like I
probably it's got to be coming up soon
anyway when I tried this it really like
instantly when I thought I thought gosh
that looks familiar and then as I went
through my collection I realized later
that oh it looks a lot like this now is
this an exact dupe or shade no and I
appreciate that because there are so
many pencil in the sense that there's so
many companies revolution makeup
revolution does it there are a time you
guys could probably name them right now
in the comments there are a lot of
companies that clearly intentionally
copy like shade for shade certain
companies palettes and while it's so
nice to have affordable ones and I
totally get it and that's why I'm like
I'm not so against it that I'm not ever
going to try to or buy them or that I
don't like those brands that's not what
I need but it is kind of nice that hard
candy I don't know if they were actually
inspired by this or not they probably
were considering the shapes but really
shade for shade it is not an exact dupe
but there are some very similar shades
and if you are really trying to save
money I mean eighty dollars is a lot of
money
this is ten dollars you're getting 15
shades and you're actually getting a
little bit more different shades with it
but today I just use the lightest like
kind of creamy shade in this and same
for this I use the second one in there
just all over my lid and on my brow bone
and then all I did was I use the blacker
color in this on both of these for my
lower lash line and kind of smudge this
liner and the only actual color I have
on my lid and in my crease is it's this
like light brown color on the these are
one and it's this one right here in the
hard candy one and I just put it all
over the lid and is retreats that's it
it's a really simple look and while
there I think there are a couple more
colors in here that are probably due I
just felt like the feel of these
palettes were very doopy and I
figured it was worth mentioning because
I know a lot of you guys are dying to
try this this so expensive I get it I
mean it kind of told me to buy out a
Dyna try so I'm like for the greater
good
it's to try it out for my channel but
I'm glad that I did too that I could
tell you that this really is very very
similar
these blend really well I was so
surprised it can be really hard to do
matte eyeshadows well and I feel like
they did next ones that I used was
liquid liner now a lot of people rave
about the Kat Von D tattoo liner this is
in trooper it's the blackest one I
apparently I know she was talking about
doing like a more matte more black one
like she wasn't totally satisfied but
people love this stuff and I I was kind
of underwhelmed when I tried it's $20
and it has what looks like a felt tip
but it's actually a brush tip it she's
very perfectly made and I just felt like
exactly what she said it wasn't as black
as I was used to I was used to the Sela
say all-day liner that I love well I
found a better version than that at the
drugstore this one this is $7.99 it's
the NYX epic ink liner in black it's
exact same brush tip it is even blacker
it stays on all day I love this I
genuinely love this more than the Kat
Von D one and I'm just so like
enthralled because I've tried a lot of
drugstore liquid liners and I liked some
here there but none of them have rivaled
like my Sela one and like I don't want
to keep paying $20 for a liner that runs
out in three or four months so for me
I'm like I want to go to the store and
literally buy like Kennedy's just
stockpile just in case something happens
and they get rid of it but I haven't
heard anyone talk about this maybe I'm
just like out of the loop but I was
astounded I feel like the tip of these
is great at doing the wing it just fills
in you'll see the way I do it is I
always like I kind of tight line and
then I put on a gel liner which I didn't
show those steps but then I go on with
liquid liner so I can clean everything
up and wing out the edge and these both
do a great job I just think the next one
is even better and it's cheaper and I
just try to rub them off and they won't
come off so that's great that sounded
sarcastic that really is awesome I just
need to get makeup remover by the way
I'm using these wet and wild under the
sheet - makeup remover towelettes
there's ten I did a Dollar Tree haul and
get ready with me
which I can also link below and just try
not cross like genuinely trying to get
them to work and some of them really
didn't work and this is one that was
just a dollar kind of bought and it
removes makeup really really well I was
very very surprised I haven't used them
on my face I just use them to wipe off
swatches so the next dupe is for my
favorite mascara I've ever tried in my
entire life genuinely in all my years on
YouTube in all my years before that just
try and make up it's a cosmetic
superhero mascara this instantly the
second you open it is ready to go I use
it on this eye but then I found this is
this by the way is $24 it's an expensive
mascara and mascara just like liner you
got to replace every few months and that
stinks because you want to spend $24
it's like four times a year that's like
a hundred dollars on mascara that's a
lot of money for mascara anyway so then
I found this essence lash prints
actually I I misspoke
you guys all told me about it so then I
went and hunted it down I love it it's
so so good it's so similar this one
retails for $4.99 and it's got a very
similar brush I do think it maybe needs
like a week to two weeks to kind of you
know air out just a little bit the more
you're opening and closing it because I
feel like that's when the formula is
really good now today I used it in it
really adds volume but it's just it's
kind of on the cusp of almost being done
so it's almost too dried out so it
clumps just a little bit easier but when
it's in its prime it is just like this
so don't feel like you need to go spend
$24 when you can spend five and get the
same thing gosh buy a new one every
month it's five times so that be 60
bucks it's still cheaper to buy a brand
new one every single month and it would
be to buy one every three months
okay so what's on my lips half of my
lips literally is high-end the other
half is not this is another Kat Von D
product against it was kind of
underwhelmed by and I really liked a
Pondy but for some reason the liquid
lipstick it's in the shade outlaw it's
not finished a bad product I have it
running up that eyelid line it's not
that it's a bad product it's just that
it was super drying and I didn't feel
like it was any better than other ones
that were way cheaper and I think that's
why I felt underwhelmed it's not
terrible it's just really drying so if
you don't mind that
then great but I prefer like the Oprah
liquid lipsticks over this anyway this
shade outlaw is a beautiful red I really
like this shade of red well I bought a
bunch of the wet and wild liquid cat
suits and these are $4.99 and while it's
different like the sponge tip applicator
is different than the exact same shade
and I swear do you think might be
defecting formula I feel the same way
about these I was so surprised I was
like wow these really stay on just as
well as this does you know it's super
pigmented you only need a thin layer but
they're both really drying and that's
true for most matte liquid lipsticks so
it's not like it's anything that crazy
but for me I'm just kind of moving out
of that stage of my life then Matt Lee
it's just too drying for me but if you
don't mind it these are both really good
but the wet wild is exactly the same
even the shade right like I went up to
my husband and said can you see any
difference between like one side my lips
Mallory's like know why I'm like don't
worry about it but just wondering good
so he can't even tell the shade is
exactly the same so if you are dying to
try out law just get the wet in loved
one totally fun books they're going to
go bad at the same time I ensures you
guys will save money
okay so it is 254 I'm filming on my
phone so I can't like hold up my phone I
filmed like a lot of videos like 5 or 6
videos so I've been drinking water and
tea you can see on both sides where it's
wearing down I've had a little bit on
this side which is the cap on D side
like a little like bat wings and I've
had to wipe them away and not really on
this side I don't know if I like drink
awkwardly or what but that was kind of
interesting
I feel like highlight wise let me get in
some natural light here that might be a
little bit more telling I feel like
highlight wise they look the same blush
bronzer everything still looks really
good I feel like the mascaras holding up
really well same with the eye shadow
nothing really to tell yet and it's been
what maybe 3 hours I'll check back in
here in a little bit and we'll see how
it's looking ok so it is 544 and I have
reapplied the lip stuff both sides twice
and I don't know just like I said
earlier I just don't like liquid
lipsticks I feel like you constantly
have to reapply it's just not my thing
so I've reapplied twice that it looks
better because I just reapply but
frankly I'm just not a fan of either but
I know some people love them so if you
do I still say go for the cheaper
version but everything else like the
highlight on both sides seems to be
looking good even the drugstore one the
blush the bronzer I feel like I lie I
mean like everything let's look at the
wing here can you guys see it I can't
see it I feel like everything looks
pretty good so I'll check in here in a
little while we're about to go to other
styler we're about to meet a pole
picture sure take a video or a picture
you look like you've never vlog before
that's your whole channel but hey if you
guys don't know he has a channel and I
will link it below it's always linked
below joke's on you joke's on who you me
did a funny joke or just a joke not a
real
anyway so we're going to go to cold
because I have some gift cards and I
need some like new shorts what are you
looking for husband
you're wearing my sunglasses a challenge
finally here that's all I ever do the
Coles go to that clearance rack
everything is unclear I still got a 50
60 and 70% off right okay go straight
there in this we'll see what we end up
with okay so it is 747 I'm heading out
into daylight Sears can really see you
oh no no I can't see again you guys know
how I feel about the lips but I feel
like the I look lasted really well the
mascara it's still like curled the line
I mean everything and Pinocchio even the
highlight I feel like it's maybe not as
strong but it's definitely still there
on both sides you can still see the
blush the bronzer honestly I kind of
feel like the drugstore side is lasting
I don't know it's hard to say though
what do you guys think because remember
this is the drugstore side so we are
going to eat some dinner here in a bit
we're going to watch more of stranger
things we started watching it last night
and it like scares me and I had like
very lucid scary dreams but we're going
to try to watch some more of that so
I'll check in here in a little bit we're
probably going to turn in kind of early
we always do but so I'll probably wash
this off soon but before I do I'll be
sure to check in before I wash it all
off okay it is 9:20 I'm going to go
ahead and wash everything off but I
wanted you guys to see of course like I
said the lips serve what they are but I
really do feel like everything lasted
pretty well it was a pretty warm kind of
humid day today and I think like the
Foundation's starting to come off but we
weren't really testing that worried but
again you can still see a little bit of
the highlight in the glow a little bit
of blush the bronzer I really think that
eye look is the winner though because I
feel like that laughs just all day long
but even still I feel like some of the
color still there that's not too bad
again verdict out I feel like you might
as well save the money and do the
drugstore because they really wore off
the same way so I'm going to watch all
the top of my face and I'm really
excited to take this off on my lips so
those are all of my dupes for today

let us know down below we can just have
a big feeding frenzy of all kinds of
