have kind of a haul because it was
recently my birthday and I have gotten
some things from some of you so I
actually filmed part of this video a few
days ago when I first received something
and then I received something else in
the mail so I figured I would kind of
update it and then so part of this video
I'll be wearing something different when
a friend of mine Michelle who I've met
through YouTube and through the
Instagram sale that I had we started
corresponding and then she sent me some
lovely goodies so you'll see that in a
second my hair is looking crazy and it's
up in a bun and I look all messed cuz I
was a mess
anyway so but right now I'm gonna show
you my friend Ali who I also met through
YouTube and has become a friend of mine
sent me this resolve is just cute sent
me some goodies my birthday which is so
sweet so let's begin I already see
something I'm excited ok so it looks
like there's a note happy birthday
that's cute if you don't know my
favorite colors pink it seems that
everyone knows that I feel like I get so
much pink and it's awesome oh she said
she's sorry they're not on time oh my
gosh are you kidding this is so sweet
that you sent me anything at all athlete
okay so first thing I see is this pink
chiffon hand sanitizer this is awesome I
go through hand sanitizer like it's my
job and because it kind of has like a
pop and pink chiffon is actually one of
my favorite scents ever it's just so
girly and juicy you know what I mean I
love this thank you and then something
I'm very excited about is a backup of my
favorite mascara the Rimmel scandaleyes
retro glam mascara and if you don't know
my back story with this I got this in an
influenster voxbox just to try out when
it was the first and brand-new product
market and I loved it and I hadn't found
it in stores in like what are we gonna
do when I want to buy this again I can't
find it and all of you guys were saying
oh I found it here and here and here and
it was awesome and then she sent me this
because she knew I was having trouble
finding it so sweet I will definitely be
using this once mine dries up because I
love it again
this is awesome it's the benefit
Porefessional now I had tried also many
primers in my
and I have never tried the Porefessional
from benefit I've never tried it because
I've never bought like the full size and
you know it usually will come in kids
but I've just never owned it so and she
said that she absolutely loves to
someone I reviewed my maybelline baby
skin primer that I really do like as
well she said oh well then you would
love this and so I'm so excited to
finally have this to try I'm just I'm
very excited - Thank You Ali and then
the last thing in here and this is funny
because when you see my January
favorites I don't know which video will
be up first I guess we'll see probably
this one but when you see my January
favorites you'll see that the lipstick
I'm wearing right now is this same brand
and type it's the Milani lipstick and
this is raspberry rush or something like
that and I love it and I love the
formula it's the first one I've ever
owned so this would be the second one
it's in Dolce or Dulce depending on what
language Dolce caramello and it looks
like the prettiest oh I'm excited the
prettiest nude color oh my gosh and I
really am excited because I'm loving
this formula the only thing that stinks
is the smell they also like watermelon
and it's just like but once you have it
on for like a minute you don't even
notice it so Ali thank you for these
goodies I'm so excited so stay tuned
because I'm about to insert the other
video of an unboxing from another friend
of mine I got this package in the mail
today from my friend Michelle who lives
in Canada and she and I started
corresponding because I was having that
Instagram sale of a lot of makeup and
clothing and stuff and we just started
talking through there because she was
interested in something and we talked
about her birth and then she said can I
send you some products um that I really
like him like a dog is so sweet and it
drops so cute and I already unwrapped
the outer packaging but so I'm so
excited to dig it so she says whoops I
might have gone a little nuts of the
packaging I just wanted to make sure it
would make it all in one people in one
piece she's got oh she's got it wrapped
like legit oh my gosh oh this is so cute
so there is a card probably won't read
it out loud but I do want to read it
okay awesome
sweet cash and it's actually perfect cuz
it came literally the day right after my
birthday so this is just like an extra
like goodie to open so this is on top
she really did wrap these and that's
what I always get nervous I'm no good
like when I send things to people I'm
terrible about wrapping things well cuz
I feel like I never have what I need to
wrap things correctly okay so this is oh
whoa I'm already excited it's like
little hand goodies so this is a okay
the brand is her bacin I'm I don't know
if I'm saying that right and I don't
even know if that's clear but it comes
with two different hands oh ho hand
creams I even miss love so two different
hand creams and it says it's got with it
has glycerin silicone and chamomile I am
so I'm sorry I just stared at that for
way too long I was trying to see what
the difference is I'm not sure but I am
so excited and it also came at this
little pot Oh a nother hand cream so
these are all hand creams ones in this
oh my gosh oh my gosh
I'm sorry I'm so excited because hand
creams I'm always trying to use so
sparing cuz really nice hand creams can
get really expensive so I'm always like
using them so sparingly like a little
dollop till I get Oliver Indians but I'm
excited now I got like a buttload so I
could just like paint green up what I
want by the way I love the messages you
guys will leave me about how like I make
you laugh because that makes me happy
because my favorite youtubers make me
laugh and that's all it just makes me
very happy to know that I entertain some
of you as well because I certainly get
entertained by others and it's just
that's just nice it's nice to laugh and
also watch stuff about makeup that you
like okay so this is adorable look at
that Tootsie Roll okay this is it's a
beeswax lip balm with the SPF of 15
nature's bees natural organic so it
reminds me of um Burt's Bees but just a
different breed this is so fun because
Canada I mean I'm assuming you guys have
a lot of brands that we don't
here and vice versa so this is really
nice cuz I really I don't think I've
ever been sent anything from from
someone that lived in Canada I know that
I haven't well my Dharma okay so this I
love the little hearts on everything
it's so cute
makes me think about Valentine's Day
mm-hmm okay it looks like this thing
itself is shaped like a heart it is oh
okay Minnie Mouse is involved I already
love it one magic towel and I don't know
if you guys can see the picture of
Minnie look at that with the little is
that a little doggie
it looks like my dog Simba within her I
love these these are so much fun and
actually I might do this if you don't
know what a magic towel you like I think
you set it in water of some sort in it
gross but I might do this with some of
my with my niece or so I'm going to keep
it but I might do it with her since you
can see now that's so cute
okay one okay this is oh I know what
this is
the anastacio clear brow gel that I'm
assuming it's the yes that I love and
it's a smaller size and I've got like
the full size one but it's running out
and it my best brow gel ever I just love
it now I haven't tried a ton of RAL gels
and I know a lot of people like well all
brow gels are the same I don't know that
that's true I've used some that I really
just the form is like to wet it takes
forever to dry I love anasazi so this
I'm really excited to have another one
okay this one she label this is my
favorite brow gel by the way my hair is
messy just deal with it just deal at
everyone it's the day after my birthday
so this is what you get my boyfriend and
I were out to dinner last night and we
got a pitcher of margaritas that was
awesome
needless to say I chugged a lot of water
before I went to bed last night because
boy I would have been very dehydrated I
think come morning sorry this is taking
me forever to open I know I know
I don't I don't know how to do this I
need like a pocket knife I don't trust
myself with scissors I end up cutting my
hands all up when I try to really wrap
these like crazy
feel like I should I unwrap everything
before but that I guess that takes away
from the fun I'm just gonna do it it's
just tricky here oh it's like cotton
candy
and now I have lipstick on it Jessica
come on oh there we go whoa it's the
essence lash and brow gel mascara and
wait a minute look how cool this look I
don't think I mean we have essence Brian
here but I don't think I've ever seen
this looks awesome I already then it
comes more to a point I don't know if
that's gonna show through
I am excited and everything I've ever
tried from essence I love their liners I
love their mascaras are great oh okay
Canada sucks this is the very first
anything this is the very first thing
that I've ever gotten that has that what
is that it's a maple leaf right the
Canadian symbol or whatever that is so
fun I'm gonna be freaking rocking these
I'm gonna wear them at the gym with my
capris and I'll running them and I'll
just pretend like I'm Canadian I'm not
making any sense okay this one says hope
you don't have this already well I hope
I don't either but hey if it's something
I like and maybe I have it and I'll have
a backup it's when we need away

be a jam beauty 89 video if I didn't
drop something geez oh I don't have this

I shout our deal I love the shadows and
I don't know what like the name is cuz
it just has a bunch of numbers on the
back but it's greens now Michelle I
don't know if you know this and it kind
of looks like taupe which brown but it's
actually greens like khaki greens or
olive greens um green is like my
favorite if I were to pick a color of
shadow it would be green I love it and I
don't know why that I really do so I'm
actually really excited and this will be
a nice thing to have for travel you know
what I mean it doesn't take up much
space it's two different shades that I
know that I'll wear so why don't we just
watch them they're gonna swatch um do
you guys remember that theme song cross

this one says love this as a setting
powder Oh Amory toffee Mary Kay and I've
been wanting to try more Mary Kay

powder foundation in ivory 0.5 I'm would
bet that's probably perfect okay first
of all yes this packaging that silver
gorgeous I am already so excited it's
just you know a mineral powder it's that
shade looks good girls I am pale and I'm
loving it I am so excited about this and
I feel like I used to try Mary Kay

does so this is I'm excited yes okay
this one long and slender okay
oh I open this one quicker this time oh
this is Estee Lauder okay it's Lauder
right not louder Estee Lauder right you
guys can't respond I can't hear you do
you guys ever respond vocally to a
YouTube video and then realize that they
can't hear you I do it more often than I
would like to admit every time I watch a
video ooh this is a lip gloss it's their
pure color gloss and it's in the shade
pink innocence and it's one of their
shimmers first of all come on this
packaging is so pretty
don't you just love high-end makeup
brands for that reason alone oh oh it
smells like it surprised me you know I
feel like a lot of glasses smell like
vanilla which is one of my favorites but
this smells like I don't I don't even
know how to describe it it's just
different it's just a really pretty
almost see-through but definitely has a
pink shimmer tone to it this is gorgeous
and I actually I need to get more lip
glosses I know it sounds silly because
I've got plenty but I really don't have
that wide of a range especially brand
wise so I'm really excited to give this
try this is gorgeous and it I like what
make it a mess okay
all right this is estee lauder advanced
night repair
synchronizer cut what is on me
synchronized recovery complex and it's
okay so I don't I'm assuming this is a
serum or lotion of some sort
I'm really excited because I've heard
there skincare is her skincare it's so
nice it's certainly like a I want to
feel it you don't have yell yeah it's
like a serum oh I'm already excited let
me know if you Michelle or whoever if
you just you know do you just use this
under your eyes you use it all over your
face obviously it's for nighttime I'm
really excited and I who doesn't love
skincare I'm trying to get my skin
perfect forever we'll see about that
all right but that is one of the reasons
I don't pan um well that and skin cancer
that'll do it for me
right okay this was his gel liner okay
and I think she mentioned something
about this in her card oh that she said
this is limited edition woohoo it's in
the shade extreme emerald again
beautiful Estee Lauder packaging oh my
gosh look at that color that is so
pretty this is either one I wouldn't I
wouldn't wear it alone on the top but
I'd probably wear it like right above my
black line or maybe alone on my lower
lash line this is such a beautiful color
oh my gosh
yes okay this one this is so sweet oh my
gosh this is so fun okay eyes shadow
there's been a lot of Rando singing any
of this video sorry guys oh it's like a
new yes okay it is Maybelline nailed it
and it's in the shade earthly taupe
which I love topes
and this one is like a it's lighter than
a normal taupe it's almost like a
champagne rosy taupe you know what I'm
saying it's almost not taupe at all I
love I love when they give them names
that make no sense that's really pretty
though and it's certainly a color I wear
all the time I mean that's like
literally what I wear all the time
awesome
