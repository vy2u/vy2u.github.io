a ton of unboxings for you I've got star
box for February to unbox I have a cozy
mug one to unbox and an influenster
voxbox which I even got one of those in
a long time
so I'll kind of describe each one as we
go through how much it costs etc let's
start with Starbucks because Starbucks I
wish Starbucks Starbucks because it's
right on top this one is $15 a month and
it's different than other subscription
box subservice and there's too many
asses too much alliteration different
than other subscription box services
because they only give their own brand
of makeup in this box whereas you know
with boxycharm ripsi whatever they send
all different kinds of brands but
Starbucks is a it's an expensive makeup
brand whether they deserve to be
expensive or not I don't know like I
feel like half of their stuff I love and
half of it I don't so I don't know so
yes this is February's star box let's
see what's in it okay the first thing
I'm seeing kind of splayed out is this
fan brush the star looks says petite
star luxe fan number 70 it's really
really thin I probably won't use it I
mean the way Iowa probably uses for like
highlight but I never apply highlight
that way like ever and it's so thin that
I don't know I might just pass this on
before I even use it just fell right
through they came with a little holder
look it falls right through it just so
you know I get all of these sent to me
for review and of course as you guys
know with review products I could review
them if I wanted or not it's up to me
it's not like I have to review them so
I'm gonna be honest with you guys you
guys know that so the next thing in here
is a star look so I'm assuming a
lipstick tender gloss lipstick now I got
a tender glossy lipstick of theirs
before and it fell out like it broke
after the first time I've using it I
really liked it so I was kind of sad and
this is in the shade cherub again let's
see Oh kind of looks like the lip color
I'm wearing today
now that's right they're tender gloss
lipsticks are really moisturizing so
like if I just did one swipe it's really
year but really kind of buttery so you
can really you can build it up from
there to there which i think is pretty
incredible doesn't have a smell at all
the packaging I will say is really well
made now I think they've really upped
their game since when I first started
getting these like a long time ago
they've really upped their game it feels
heavier and more well made and this is a
really pretty color I probably really
will wear this they always send like a
little crystal like a healing crystal in
the boxes I always forget about it
because I usually don't see it but just
a cute little thing they do so this is
the Starla looks I keep saying star lock
star I'm a mess in myth a diamond line
pencil so it's just like a silvery
almost charcoal it feels really like
smooth like it glides on and none of the
glitter is like fallin around it which I
in the past with they're like gem
pencils or whatever they're called
diamond line pencils maybe they have
I've had glitter fallout a lot so I'm
hoping this one won't be like that I
found a few of their liners that I do
like that have glitter that don't so
that's a really pretty color that's one
that I would typically wear on my lower
lash line anyway so awesome huh so the
last thing that was in this box is a
card it says Valentine's Day gifts for
couples date night box calm and you says
sign up for any subscription and email
your receipt to receive $40 cash back in
your first box for the date night box so
I might try that I mean Tyler going on
the date with Tyler sure okay the next
thing I'm gonna unbox is the cozy mug
and this is 1995 a month so it's a
little more expensive but this is not
makeup
it's like tea and coffee and things like
that it's one of my favorites and I love
getting them during the different
seasons cuz I can fall they've got
amazing teas for fall and at Christmas
time it was the holiday box so amazing
I'm so just magical it's a very magical
box to me so I'm excited to see it looks
very springy so I'm excited to see it
and they always have the cute owl and
this time the owls got a little flower
in his hair that's super her hair I
guess I should say this is se Kwang's
girlfriend you guys see you say Quan
over there look at him right there
that's this girlfriend so there's this
girlfriend again yes so it goes through
on the back all the different things in
there how to use them etc so I'm I'm
just really excited this is their
February one I wasn't sure if it was
February March but it is February I like
that they went a different route and
they didn't do red and pink they did
pink and purple I just think you know
everyone it's like Oh February
Valentine's Day for sure but it's kind
of nice that they went a little
different route for this February into
March time okay oh my gosh I'm already
excited the first thing on top is this
tea Forte harvest apple spice and it
says to lighten this most wonderfully
interesting tea it's got a delicious
taste and flavor and fragrance just a
loose tea and I'm excited because if
it's apple spice I will love that that
seems very fall-like I will admit but at
the same time I don't care I would drink
it any time of year so that is awesome
next thing in here is this like little
tin it says portfolio collection number
17 boardwalk surf and sand spun sugar
caramel caramel and driftwood inspired
by is it a candle it is oh it's so fresh
like it's all of those things it's like
very clean and perfumey but it's also
kind of sweet and floral e but also like
fruity it's everything I love when they
send random extras like this because you
know this is something that I can just
have up on my little Alex 9 drawer
burning in the springtime and it's just
such a fresh scent and I can beat your
cup of tea it's just it's so cute so
that is an awesome addition to this next
there is this a whole that's part of the
baggage look this is the lavender citrus
tea Forte so the same brand tea over ice
so this is an iced tea thing and I want
to see if it's like in a little sachet
or whatever yeah it's in like a pyramid
thing so it's good for I'm assuming one
it's a unique blend of soft white tea
lavender lemon balm and bergamot awesome
contains very little caffeine so I am
excited about this seems very springy
that is for sure
the last thing in here is this little
baggie with a bunch of tea
it looks like so oh this is a it says
the incense match in coconut for an
actual match for it says light match let
burn down to half an inch blowout in
place in an ashtray as shown above
there's like a little picture so I'm
assuming it's like a tiny incense holder
or a little incense thing that lights
itself this is so interesting you see
them so you light it and then blow it
out after it's burned to half of an inch
and just set it in something like that's
a glass I mean doesn't have to be an
ashtray but something that's maybe meant
for incense that's pretty cool I used to
be really big into burning like incense
cones and some sticks I don't do it as
much cuz it does bother my throat and I
know you know even breathing in that
smoke is not great for you but I do love
the smell and so I actually this might
be something that I might give a try
Tyler will like this cuz he really likes
incense too
that is awesome so that is another added
extra and then in here there are these I
love getting different teas to try this
is my tea leaf and it's three different
teas in those really nice bag type
things
so there's vanilla bean organic African
nectar yeah and green tea tropical ooh
that one would be good so definitely
excited to give these a try I actually
make tea at school where I teach as well
like a little thing in my room that I
can make hot water with and I'm
whispering like anyone anyway so this is
all great I'm probably gonna bring all
of these there to try so really really
excited this is a great way if you're
just getting into tea what I like about
it is I am you know recently getting
into tea over the past few years I've
been getting into it and it's a great
way for me to try other brands outside
of the few that are sold at my local
grocery store you know teas that I would
probably never heard of I wouldn't want
to buy a whole box of but I get to try
them and there have been a few that I've
tried that I've gone online and ordered
a whole box of after trying one because
I realize how much I love it so I just
love this box I think it's so cute and
it's such a treat for yourself that
isn't just more
sometimes the makeup can be overwhelming
the last thing we're going to open is
the influenster voxbox now this is
something that everyone would get for
free it's not because I'm on YouTube
Influenster you sign up for free on
their website and you just you review
and write products and you invite others
to join the site and you gain basically
points on there and the more points are
the more influence you've had meaning
the more things you've reviewed etc the
more likely you are to get free boxes
sent to you and I before I even had a
YouTube channel I was getting some of
these I think I know it was before I had
like any I mean it wasn't what I'm
trying to say is that you don't have to
have a youtube channel to get these
anyone can get them tons of people get
them and they are completely free you
just have to continue to review stuff
and build your points up it really
didn't take too long to get my first box
so this is the X 0 box and ok so there's
some like things like adorn me which
I've actually hauled from them before
eBay Lands End like sometimes they'll
give you like percent off things you can
use john frieda coupon but anyway so it
goes through what everything is which
actually that is pretty nice I don't
know if they used to do that so the
thing right on top is an influencer
t-shirt huh pretty cool what else I'll
keep it to sleep in whatever t-shirts I
just don't ever wear t-shirts that's
just just me okay the first thing I'm
seeing in here are these Tide Pods now
it's a foreign one at the botanical rain
it comes with 10 pack so I mean I will
certainly be using it are you kidding
detergent same remover brightener and
long-lasting freshness yeah you just put
it in that's it that's nice I mean I I
feel like these things are so expensive
for what they are but I'm excited to
give it a try because it's not something
I would just go out and buy for myself
so I will I'm excited to try it the next
thing itself next thing in here ooh is
this Colgate optic white Express white
why your teeth in three days that's
actually great because I drink a lot of
coffee
and I have to work really hard to make
sure sorry my lip glosses traveling all
over my face I have to work really hard
to make sure that I'm doing whitening
things because otherwise I feel like I
would have the yellowest teeth in the
world just because of the coffee I drink
so it's in fresh mint I'm excited too
I'm gonna just kind of open it to see
what the actual bottle looks like okay
so it's just like a simple it's cute I
tried an optic white before it wasn't
necessarily there Express white but one
of theirs and I remember not feeling
impressed
I used the crest 3d white and I really
liked that but I will certainly give us
a try and those maybe I would love it
the next thing in here
oh speaking of Colgate optic white they
also had in here their toothbrush plus
built-in whitening pen you know with my
wedding coming up in a few months this
isn't a bad idea to use a whitening pen
for a while so you store the pen like
inside the brush it says it's
interesting you apply the gel it takes
only seconds to apply and adhere to your
teeth no waiting and no rinsing and then
you can just store it in the brush back
in the bottom of it that's interesting
that's great I mean for me for traveling
I mean I feel like I could although
that's a gel I probably to keep it in a
separate bag but cool I'll definitely
use it sweet lots of things in here look
more like Beauty type products this is
the skin fix hand Repair Cream and it's
just one fluid ounce you know this is
funny because I just posted on Instagram
a couple days ago about my night stand
roar I pulled out I was kind of cleaning
it out and I pulled all the hand creams
that I have in my nightstand drawer out
and I had six in there like I just will
randomly grab one and then use it and
just stick it in there and I just keep
doing it just keep doing it and I had
six in there I'm like I am such a moron
so let's go ahead and add more to it I'm
kidding
I do love hand cream so don't you all it
just makes me feel so like moisturize
and my cuticles have been a mess all
winter long so cool excited to give that
a try
the next thing in here is that John
Frieda oh well that would explain they
gave a coupon to buy like the full size
for that it's the luxurious volume
seven-day volume protein and carrots and
in shower treatment so how do you use it
oh it doesn't say let's see if it says
I'm little
they gave here um yes it says this
lightweight semi-permanent treatment
texturally transforms fine hair leaving
it full even after multiple washes that
is pretty cool and it says the full size
of this is $9.99 so but of course with
your little coupon there you get it for
what was the $2 off cool I will
certainly give this a try now when I've
got my crazy curly hair going on I don't
need any more volume it's a mess but
when I do I mean most days I don't wear
it like this so that actually would be
kind of nice alright and the last thing
in here is this pack of john frieda okay
some more john frieda beach blonde
purifying shampoo sea salt spray i won't
like that and detangling conditioner now
are you supposed to actually be blonde
for this or does it matter I want to
read about it says Beach blonde four
perfectly undone and carefree beachy
styles the lightweight shampoo and
conditioner nourish parts strands while
the sea salt spray texturizers for
perfectly so it doesn't say like it's
not it doesn't have anything in it
that's gonna mess with my brunette hair
so that's good I don't want to give that
a try these should again travel size and
since I travel a lot I probably Lily
really will use those and I actually
just recently decluttered I haven't put
it up yet because I'm putting them up in
order on my declutter series but I
decluttered all of my travel sized
things and I had like a million tiny
bottles from all the different hotels
we've been to so I got rid of a time and
I feel so much better now because before
I was just like I have so many like it's
so overwhelming but these actually might
be worth giving a try anyway so I'll
keep them and I will use them and I am
thankful for them so hopefully that was
