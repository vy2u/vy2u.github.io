everyday makeup drawer videos so I think
this is the see that the third or fourth
one I've done I can link my most recent
one down below but basically in these
videos I just show you what I've kind of
pulled out of my collection and put in
this one drawer that I kind of go to
every morning when I'm getting ready so
I always have enough for a full face so
that way if I am in a rush I can just
open the drawer I have enough products I
don't have to dig through my other
drawers on a regular basis I have enough
time in the mornings I do kind of switch
up the blush and all kinds of different
things but it is nice to have everything
all in one as well so this the head
drawer has a lot of products I'm trying
to use because I haven't used enough to
determine how I feel about them or
they're just products I love that I like
to use everyday so here we go okay so
here is what I have in the drawer this
time I actually have a different
organizer in here before I'll just show
you real fast
I had this organizer in there and now
this is where I'm keeping a lot of
moisturizers and things that I got from
Target in the closet organization
section now I'm using one that's just
three big ones and I got it from TJ Maxx
for around seven dollars so it might
have been Marshall's TJ it doesn't
matter either one I think it was TJ Maxx
anyway so we'll start over here
I have my origins Vytas Inge SPF 15 I
haven't been using much at all lately I
don't think I've used it in quite a
while so let's start using that my
Revlon nearly naked which was in my
October favorites I just love this stuff
and then two lip products since it is
November now this is the Revlon
it's berry smoothie their lip butter and
then this is called mauve me and it's
just a really pretty these are so hard
to open mauve color and it's by
Maybelline I'll have to shut it in a
second then these two products I also
featured in my favorite video the
blistex revive and restore I love the
restore at night you use the revive
during the day with an SPF and they're
just really really
really really moisturizing then back
here I have my ELF makeup remover pen a
L'Occitane hand cream because my hands
get so dry especially once I've washed
my hands after doing my makeup I always
like to put on a hand cream before I
head out the door and then a Revlon lip
gloss Super Lustrous in peach petal and
it's just nice this is gonna be nice to
pair with these especially since this
mauve me one is deeper than I'm used to
wearing I can use this to kind of tone
it down if I need and then over here for
eyes I've got my Maybelline Color tattoo
and barely branded I just love a lot of
these were favorites that I mentioned in
my most recent video then I have two
infallible shadows I have eternal
sunshine and then what was this one
called amber rush I use amber rush
typically on my outer corner and this
one on my lid and I just love those
colors I also have this philosophy quad
I got once at Big Lots and it's kind of
funny because I don't think they sell
them anymore but look how beautiful
their beautiful shades this taupe color
is so pretty this deep purple color is
as well and they're all pretty much
matte so I really really the brush oh I
really really like that so here I've got
my L'Oreal 24-hour liner in blackest
black that I use everyday my Anastasia
brow powder and medium brown I use
everyday then back here I have these
eyeliners I'm just trying to use up a
Smashbox one and a NYX one you keep
seeing them because I still don't use
them up and then I have a BH Cosmetics
liquid liner and I'm gonna I haven't
really gotten to try that much so I'm
basically that's a one I want to try out
my covergirl flamed out pencil I don't
know the shade number or the shade name
but I love that and then my Jordie and a
12 hour eyeliner pencil I love the
L'Oreal magic Lumi my Revlon lash potion
that I've fallen in love with - I know I
keep saying I love everything but a lot
of these are favorites so I really do
this is what I'm trying out it's the elf
clear gel like for your brows and I've
used it a couple times I don't really
like it but it's been a while so I
figure I'll try it again see how I like
it we'll see then over here I've got an
elf shimmering facial whip that I just
wanted to try I used to love the stuff
and if you watch any of my earlier
videos I talked so highly about
stuff and I haven't used it in a long
long time so it used to have words on it
all wore off but then I have a tart
blush and blushing bride I can get this
open
it is so beautiful and I think that's
gonna be really nice here in November as
the weather gets really really chilly
it's a very gray day out here it's just
gonna look really pretty with scarves
and cream-colored shirts and I know it's
so specific but I just love this blush
then my Maybelline Dream matte powder I
haven't given a lot of love lately so I
pulled that out of my collection then
the Tarte Park Avenue princess bronzer I
like and I haven't used too much lately
so I pulled that out this one I never
reach for and it's so beautiful it's a
pixie all-over magic and brightening
radiance and it's a highlighter and it's
so let me swatch it it's so pretty very
pigmented certainly but it's really
really pretty and you can you know if
you want lighter colors you can go there
darker depending on your skin tone I
usually just swirl them all together but
I really like this and I need to use it
more so I pulled it out and then I also
have this palette the Shady Lady Vol one
palette and it's from the balm and look
at these colors they're just so pretty
the ones on the right which is actually
the bottom here the jet-setting Jennifer
all about Alex and easy Weezy are my
three favorites and they actually create
a really nice look all together with
this on the lid this and the crease and
this and the outer corners so beautiful
so I love these they're so pigmented I
don't own the other volumes but I would
not mind owning them someday because
they are really really great shadows so
that is all that's in my everyday makeup
drawer I'm sure I'll be updating this in
a couple weeks and I'll catch you guys
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
