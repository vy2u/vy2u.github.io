share with you a pregnancy update I've
only done one of these so far don't
remember exactly how many weeks it was
but it was earlier on in my 20s week
wise and now I'm at 29 weeks by the time
you're watching and I think I'll be
close to 30 actually so I just kind of
wanted to update you if you are
currently around that many weeks and
you're just like hey or these symptoms
I'm feeling like normal is anyone else
feeling these or if you're just curious
I guess I've been watching a lot of
these I'll just search like whatever
weeks I'm at I'll search on youtube and
watch a video or two just because I like
hearing from other people and their
experience and again it makes me feel
more normal if I'm experiencing certain
things and then I watched that and they
are - I'm like okay like you're fine
Jess yeah you're fine
so just to share a little bit mood
swings I have been very I would like to
say normal when it comes to like my mood
like I'm already an emotional person so
being a little bit more emotional wasn't
really that crazy to me and it wouldn't
affect me too much
it really will in your phrase it hadn't
affected me too much until now now I
feel like literally this morning I was
getting ready and I was like filming
getting ready for a video for makeup
video and I literally finished the eye
look that you see and I'm so unhappy
with it and I think it looks okay now
this is a pointless story except for it
to tell you that literally Tyler my
husband came in and I was like will you
focus the camera cuz I'm about to film
and I just started crying and crying and
crying and there was no explanation like
I he was like are you you know he's
trying to come for me but he doesn't
know what to do when I'm just absolutely
crazy crying you know and it's just one
of those things and then I was fine and
it's so weird to deal with because you
don't even know how to deal with
yourself like I don't know how to deal
with myself when I'm just crying over
nothing crying because an eye shadow
looked it and go the way I want it are
you serious Jessica with a rational mind
I can look at that and say that's crazy
but when you're experiencing it yourself
you did you're like I don't know I can't
stop crying
eventually I pulled it together and
everything was fine but if you're
experiencing anything like that
it's normal your normal it's okay that's
what I'm telling myself anyway but other
problems I've had I'm still feeling
energetic you know I'm tired after work
when I get home but I always say hurts
when I get home from work I'm a teacher
and it's just exhausting like really any
job is exhausting but it's mentally and
physically draining so I've always been
tired but I'm definitely a little more
tired and I'll feel like aches and my
lower back if you want to see low bump
little girl there she is she's certainly
gotten a little bigger it's kind of
harder to tell because I'm in like less
of a I don't know less of a fitted top
than I normally am but and don't worry
I'm comfortable I've got pj pants on
underneath but regardless another
symptom I've had is just having trouble
sleeping
I'm just so uncomfortable and even like
when I'm and I'm not even that big and
that's what like scares me I'm like oh
my gosh it's only gonna get worse for
the next 11 weeks but just at the point
where you know all whilst be sitting on
the couch watching TV and I cannot get
in a position where I'm comfortable
laying on my side on my back I might you
know sitting up and and that's just what
watching a movie so let alone being in
bed trying to sleep now we do have a
mattress I really really like we bought
actually early on when I found I was
pregnant we were like you know what we
need to invest in a better mattress cuz
we bought one that was it was a memory
foam one it was a really good deal was
like a hundred bucks and for him it
never hurt his back but my back I was
having so much pain so I'm really glad
we invested in a much more expensive
mattress that you know I read so many
reviews it's the brand is satva saat VA
and all the reviews I read are just like
it's amazing for everyone but especially
if you have back pains and it like cured
it overnight so that's the good news is
that my mattress isn't contributing to
the problem but you know when you've got
all that weight you know pulling against
your lower back I mean it just tires
your lower back out so I had bought a
snuggle one of those giant pillows that
comes like around I hated it so much I
hate it so now I'm one of those people
that like if I feel trapped at all I'm
not truly claustrophobic I'm not but if
I feel trapped at all like if the bed
like
the blanket is tucked in at the bottom I
will lose it I pull like we'll go to a
hotel and I will pull the blanket out of
all the corners because I cannot feel
trapped like that and so with this new
goal I felt the ultimate entrapment
because it not only is you know coming
between your legs which is very
comfortable but the way it comes around
your neck you don't have much room to
like move and it made me crazy like I
could not stand it so I tried it like
three or four nights and I was like nope
nope nope I'm done so I ended up we saw
a pregnancy wedge it was the brand is
boppy I can link it below and for a
while before I was too too big I would
put it just between my legs and it was
really comfortable you know sleeping on
my left side putting it between my legs
but then I realized that it's even more
comfortable to put underneath my bunk
because and I hadn't realized that that
was I think a part of the pain and a
part of why I wasn't comfortable but
once I started putting that wedge
underneath oh my gosh I slept so much
better and so then I would just take
either another pillow or really I just
taken my comforter and tucked it between
my legs and that's enough to keep that
comfortable for my back as well so I
feel like I finally found the right
cocktail of like pillows and blankets
and everything I'm forcing Tyler to
sleep with the window open and like two
fans on cuz I'm like hot and cold and I
want it right in between and so with the
heat going and I know that's like so bad
for energy but like with the heat going
and the window open it's just right I
know it's crazy but I've been sleeping
the past I would say three nights I've
slept all the way through the night and
that is huge for me because usually I
wake up like 3 or 4 times so really
really thankful that I've kind of
figured that out so you know try some
different things body pillows I never
tried just one body pillow I tried
that's new go like I said anyway so I'm
thankful for that we'll see how well it
continues I've noticed a lot of like
just weird skin issues I've had like I
have of course I'm wearing a full face
of makeup but like I've never before
until I was pregnant having redness
right here and it'll show up like I feel
like it's something that used to show up
when I would cry
I I would see that redness like even as
a kid but you know on a normal
day-to-day basis I would never see any
redness there but now being pregnant
I'll see it all the time and I wake up
you can even see it like in some of my
get ready with me videos I've done like
first thing you're first seeing me with
nothing on my face and you can see the
redness there and that's it's new for me
now I'm obviously able to cover it up
just with foundation and stuff and it's
fine
I know a lot of people have melasma
which I don't know if that's like a mild
form of what I have but it's not painful
and it's easy to cover so I'm not too
concerned about it but I know some
people have had much much worse so you
know it might get to a point where you
might want to see your doctor or
wherever talk
mine's not at that point where I'm too
concerned about it but I know it can get
a lot worse so that's something just to
be aware of that our skin is changing
and it's just different some people have
like super glowy skin some people have
the opposite your hair you know can be
more brittle I feel like my hair is kind
of in-between I do feel like I'm losing
less hair and then I always hear that
once you give birth you lose a ton of
hair but I've heard that's kind of a
common thing that you know your hair is
actually a little bit stronger right now
but then of course after you've birth
it's not but so it's kind of nice I've
got a full head of hair anyway but I
feel like I used to seeing more in the
shower that I lose then I am now I feel
like I'm not seeing like any which is
very weird I think my biggest pregnancy
cravings have been just chocolate milk
so like typically chocolate chocolate
almond milk for me and then like cheese
and crackers like that combo chocolate
milk and cheese and crackers is so so
good and I've really been into Caesar
salads like really been into them so I'm
just kind of making them at home I'll
just get like hearts of romaine and chop
those up and chop up some Tomatoes Oh
Caesar dressing and like croutons and
some parmesan and then sometimes I'll
throw on red onion just because I love
red onion that with chocolate milk is
amazing I am like so those are kind of
like the weird things I guess is not
even that weird but that's just what
I've been craving a lot like I literally
before filming that's what I had earlier
on I was craving sour patch kids a lot
so one of one of
parents in my classroom bought me a
bagel thing of Sour Patch Kids so those
are still in my closet and I munch on
those from time to time Oh only sour
patch kids for healthy for you but one
thing I've been trying to do to like get
those healthy things in me because of
course you know you're gonna create a
bunch of unhealthy stuff and while I do
give in to those cravings sometimes I
mean I'm not perfect and please I'm just
human I'm human I'm pregnant but one
thing I have been doing is to force
myself to eat more like spinach and
fruits
I'll make smoothies for the week and all
I'll do is I'll just take my big old you
know classic blender and I'll put a
bunch of milk or almond milk for me
almond milk look I've said that twice
anyway I'll put almond milk in and some
vanilla Greek yogurt and I'll even put
in some protein powder and then I'll put
in a ton of spinach because I'm not a
huge spinach salad person but that's a
great way to get a ton of spinach and
you won't taste it in the smoothie I
promise so just hear me out put a ton of
spinach in there and then I'll put in
usually an apple just because it fills
it really well but you don't taste the
Apple either so I'll cut up some apples
and throw a few in there and then
usually I'll just do strawberries and
bananas that's it so I'll put like two
bananas in a handful or two of
strawberries blend the whole thing it'll
last me like four days of smoothies and
I'll just leave them in the fridge so
while they're not like crazy frozen
smoothies there they're still really
really good and they totally last
throughout the week so with those big
handfuls of spinach it will turn green
but it tastes delicious
another smoothie thing I've been trying
is the same stuff the milk the yogurt
protein powder and spinach but then I'll
add in a mango like we just bought a big
ol bag of frozen mango I'll add in mango
and pineapple and banana that might be
my favorite and you can throw apples in
any of these cuz it fills it and it's a
little cheaper because you can buy cheap
bags of apples and what I say what I
mean fills that I mean it'll you know
literally make more smoothies and it
adds more nutrition but it doesn't
affect the taste and it's a really cheap
way to add some filler to your smoothie
because mangoes and they you know those
can get kind of pricey depending on what
you're using anyway that one is
incredibly tasty and I always use
vanilla
yogurt because it really does just make
it taste better yes there's sugar in it
but for me I'm like you know what if
it's gonna force me to drink and get all
of this spinach and fruit and all this
good stuff in my body it's worth it to
get the vanilla versus the non flavored
because it's just otherwise it's not
quite as good
it's just not I'm an incentive spinach
you could do kale you could do both I've
done only kale I've done both just kind
of depends on what we have at the time
anyway so that's one way I've tried to
just be more healthy because even with
my salad you know I guess I'm getting
some good stuff in with that cell but
I'm also putting Caesar dressing on it
and you know what I mean in cheese so
I'm just kind of finding ways to force
myself to get all of those really good
nutrients in because yes taking a
prenatal is great and it's important but
I mean I know and my doctors told me
that the best way to get those vitamins
into your system is through your diet
what you're eating
it's just absorbed better it's probably
just generally better for you and
speaking of prenatals I've tried a few I
actually have my best friend happens to
be like a physical trainer and she does
a lot with supplements and so she's
ordered me these packets of prenatal
vitamins that are like perfect but
they're really expensive so if anyone
has any prenatal vitamin recommendations
cuz I'm really in search of one that
really is good that you know if you've
used or you've heard like okay this is
better than these other brands please
let me know so our next step is we're
going to the doctor here very soon like
in I want to say a week ish and that's
where we'll start getting the ball
rolling with like okay we need to
register at the hospital and start
taking you know I really want to take a
labour childbirth class and Tyler does
too because we you know you can read
only so much online and it's like I'd
rather just take a class learn what I
need to learn and leave it at that
because sometimes you can learn too much
and it's it's overwhelming it stresses
you out more than you need so I really
I've kind of stopped reading a lot of
blogs and any of that because it was
just dressing me out and then I feel
like oh my gosh I don't know anything
there's so much learn like no Jessica
you know what people have been doing
this for thousands of years go to the
class you'll learn what you need to
learn and leave it at that because
reality is all hopefully survive it and
all will be fine on the other end of it
it's just I've just never experienced it
but I'd also like to take a
breastfeeding class of some kind just
because you know I just heard so many
horror stories about you know how
difficult it can be and all that stuff
so I am kind of interested in that and
if they had like a lactation consultant
in the hospital I would definitely want
to consult with them make sure I'm doing
it right like how you know all those
little things that go along with it so
but if you haven't seen our we've done
some baby shower halls the things you
guys have sent us is so lovely I will
link those below if you're interested
just in kind of seeing some of the
things we've registered for I do think
that you know there are a lot of things
that we are over prepared for I mean we
have things that I know that we could do
without but it being our first time and
it's not really knowing what to expect
fully I'm you know you you kind of over
prepare anyway at least that's the kind
of person I am and then I figure you
know okay if I don't use it then I can
pass it on to someone else having a baby
that might use it or you know whatever
or donate it to a charity but I'm so
nervous and anxious that I I'm the
classic over-prepare and I like to have
more than what I need and we're so
blessed because we have lots of family
and friends that are so excited for us
and are getting us lots of necessities
as well and so we're just we're just so
excited Nursery update we will be doing
a tour here soon there are some I'm
trying to find some frames for some
Disney Prince we have that I were
wanting to put on the walls and stuff
but it's coming together I'm like
looking through because I can see into
the nursery from here but slowly but
surely we're kind of looking through
finishing that up soon I would bet it'll
probably be later April before we get it
up because that'll be after our baby
showers and that way we'll feel like
it's a little bit more complete so
that's kind of an update on how life is
going for me I'm trying to think like if
I've missed anything or forgotten
anything work out wise I'm doing lots of
stretching and just little things like
honestly I am typically a runner but if
you've seen my other pregnancy update
where I talked about all the kind of
complications we had early on I've
stopped running I do walk and of course
the teaching I'm walking all the time
but I do walk I'll take my dog and Tyler
my husband will go
we'll walk around the neighborhood each
day when it's nice enough that's what
stinks it's so cold and I'll do other
like kind of strength exercises that are
like pregnancy approved kinds of things
but other than that I'm not doing too
much and that's that's my thing I'm like
Jessica it's okay you're doing enough
you're still strengthening your body
you're still stretching but you're not
doing so much that you're worried that
you're you know anyway that's a whole
different thing I know a lot of people
run all the way through who knows if I
am pregnant again with a second baby and
all doesn't and all goes well maybe I
will continue to run throughout it
because that was my idea with this one
but it just didn't work out that way so
anyway I hope that this was helpful if
you are pregnant or entertaining or
interesting if you're just curious and I
hope that you'll subscribe to catch more
and I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
