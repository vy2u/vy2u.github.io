to share with you my 34 week pregnancy
update so at the time I'm filming this
I'm kind of between 33 and 34 so you
know take it with a grain of salt we're
kind of in between but I'm like I'm not
gonna call 333 and a half that's
ridiculous and really by the time this
is up it probably probably really will
be at 34 weeks so I just wanted to
update you on some things going on some
symptoms I'm having I watched these
videos from other youtubers and I'm
finding a lot of new youtubers because I
just want to know like are the symptoms
I'm experiencing normal so it it gives
me a lot of comfort to watch other
people do these updates and that's why
I'm doing them I want to bring you guys
some comfort if you are pregnant or
maybe in the future you're pregnant and
you come back and watch these videos I
don't know maybe you're just curious
maybe you're not pregnant at all I don't
know let's just start with symptoms I
definitely get short of breath really
easily like I'm at about right now all I
did was stand up and like pose for the
thumbnail that for this video that's all
I did
Marty out of breath my back hurts a lot
my back hurts when I'm sitting down my
back hurts when I'm standing up my back
hurts when I'm laying down like it
doesn't seem to matter my back always
hurts it is what it is but I feel like
you know I've been I've been feeling
better in the morning after I sleep
because I'll have like I just got a body
pillow and while I think the body feels
a little bit too thick I tried that
snuggle thing and I frickin hated it so
I have like a wedge under my tummy and
then I have a pillow between my legs and
it does feel a lot better and that seems
to help relieve the back pain I'll also
use a heating pad sometimes I think I
mentioned that in a past update and it's
Auto time so it goes off after you know
a certain number of minutes which is
really nice because I can just even if
I'm on my side I can cut it's long
enough that I can drape it I'll see if I
can find a similar one online cuz I've
had this one for years but it's long
enough that I can kind of drape it over
my back on my side so it'll actually
stay in place really for long enough I
have started getting prenatal massages
and I gave in because a co-worker of
mine who had twins last year was telling
me about it and she was like honestly
Jessica they have pretty good package
deals and it's so nice she was like if
you can swing it it's worth it so I was
like well let me give it a try so I went
and gave it a try and I was like oh my
gosh and the people are license you know
you want to make sure you're going to
someone that's actually licensed and
prenatal massage
you don't you know because there are
certain things you have to do
differently like you have to be on your
side at least the workplace I'm going I
know there are some places where you can
lay on your tummy and they have like a
literal bed with like a hole for your
tummy I've not done that I've been doing
sideline side lying once out they call
it and it's really nice I leave feeling
like okay
and it's something to look forward to
like when I'm like oh my gosh my back is
killing me and then I think oh
tomorrow's my massage it helps me kind
of get through it and I don't know how
else to describe that so that has been
nice obviously not everyone can afford
that but it's been really really nice
and something like I said that I can
kind of look forward to I didn't start
it until recently because you know I
really haven't felt this sore until
recently I have gained more weight than
I wanted to and with it if you've seen
my other pregnancy updates and I'll link
my other ones below the first one I did
I talked about like the huge
complications I had early on and I I was
not allowed to work out so now I'm
technically not supposed to be doing
huge workouts but I can do a little bit
so I'll do squats and I'll do you know
some Pilates and yoga a little bit but
they don't want me doing anything super
strenuous I can walk and things like
that but no running anymore because of
those issues I had early on so with that
in mind I have gained a little more
weight and I feel like I'm you know for
the most part really watching what I'm
eating I mean a lot of salads I mean
tons of fruits and vegetables you know
sweet potatoes and eggs and things that
are just really good for you if you're
pregnant and I still feel like I am so
it's like it's frustrating you know you
step on that scale and you're like I'm
right at that threshold where she said
this is the top of how much you I want
you to I want you to gain you know at
the same time I'm like I don't feel like
I've gained a lot of weight this way I
really I mean I just have it you can see
my belly button hook it up it's it's
just this way and I feel like I most of
my weight is being gained in my like
thighs and my butt and that you know and
there's only so much you can do so I'm
trying to just roll with it and not you
know stress cuz that's something I
shouldn't be stressing about I know that
I'm doing this right I'm drinking tons
of water too and I'm working out as
much as I'm approved to so beyond that
there's only so much you can do so if
you're kind of in that same boat where
you're feeling like gosh I feel like I'm
gaining weight so fast and I keep
reading about these people that only
gain like 15 pounds and I'm like well
first of all I don't know how in the
world anyone only gains 15 pounds I do
not understand that is amazing to me
because I feel like I'm trying so hard
and yet I still now I was on
progesterone hormone shots for a long
time and that can contribute to weight
gain as well so I think that might be a
part of it the good news is that I'm now
not taking those shots with a test they
were testing my blood every two weeks
while we were doing this twice a week
and they it's finally at a level where
the like all right you're at a safe
level so they do need to check me again
I think my next check for that is in
like two weeks to make sure like now
that you've been off of it for a month
or so how are you doing so I'm hoping
I'm doing well with that I don't know
exactly
you know how much progesterone unique
because I know it has to do with going
into labor so I'm like well if they
would need me on it they need me on it
soon because soon enough I'll be ready
to go into labor anyway you know so
we'll see how that all goes but the
other piece of kind of news update is we
went in for another ultrasound which
we've gone in for so many views of these
issues and they said that they noticed a
something a little odd with my umbilical
cord with where it's coming out of the
placenta and again this is also new to
me like I don't know you know I know as
much as I know and that's it you know I
ask questions I look some stuff up
online but there's so much I don't know
since this is my first kid but basically
they were saying there's something weird
with the umbilical cord so they wanted
to do another ultrasound to look at it
again so we did and she was saying you
know it's really kind of hard to see
whoa look closer at the ultrasound the
doctor and I later this was the
technician but I said well can you tell
us how much she weighs like is she
growing okay and she said she actually
is a little bit underweight she's in the
24th percentile and I'm like and again
I'm thinking like well then why am I
getting all this weight she's not even
like but she said really they don't
worry too much until they're in the 10th
percentile until well hopefully it never
gets there
but she is small you know maybe a week
or two smaller than she should be so
she's measuring like a week and a half
smaller does that make sense but they
didn't seem to be too concerned so we're
doing another ultrasound here in a few
weeks and they're gonna check her growth
again make sure everything's okay that
she's growing still etc but it was
freaky you know you
I started looking up like weird
umbilical cord insertion problems then
there's like oh my gosh all these horror
stories so I'm trying to be better about
not looking up too much online because
it always leads to horrible things you
know what I mean when then you're
stressed out and you can't sleep and you
have no appetite so I felt better going
in and them talking me through that and
all of that and how so I ended up
getting a call and they're saying you
know the umbilical cord is now looking a
little bit more normal but they do want
to see me you know and I'm in there
every other week anyway so but so that's
kind of an update on that
I think the hospital I'm delivering at
we finally had our they do this program
where it's like they give you a tour the
hospital which any hospital will do for
you of course but you meet with the
nurse and she really talks you through
like everything so I had like I took
copious notes asked all the questions we
had we both did and we got to see the
rooms and delivery rooms and the
postpartum rooms and all of that and it
was it ease so much of my mind so if
you're someone that gets anxious about
those the unknown especially if you've
never stayed in a hospital like I've
never had to stay in a hospital thank
goodness I was incredibly nervous and I
think I was more nervous about all of
that than I was about the actual you
know pain of labor itself and so going
in and doing this taking the tour of the
hospital asking those questions I
literally left feeling like a huge
weight had been lifted off my shoulders
cuz I felt like okay like I can do this
I understand all my questions were
answered and I just felt so much better
about what to expect like on the day
where do we go what door do we go to
what do we say like those are the kinds
of things I get nervous about and I know
I'm not alone so I felt so much better
doing that so if you have the
opportunity if you're you know pregnant
maybe in your third trimester and you
can go on a tour the hospital do it do
it do it do it if you can talk to a
nurse do it I mean it's it I cannot
explain and I was even nervous to go do
that
that's my personality I don't like doing
things like that but I was glad that I
did because in the end it it was so
worth it I'd rather be nervous on a
normal day going in and getting the
sword then nervous on a day that I
already nervous about going into labor
you know so we have a class scheduled
most hospitals offer for free in our SS
- they call it like they're done in a
day thing where you you and your husband
or spouse whatever go together and you
get three classes it's labor and
delivery class and they talk through
pain options like epidurals and
narcotics and all the you know essential
oil all those different things and they
also give you a childcare class so you
know like changing a diaper and you know
how should they sleep all of those
little things that you know you might
not know or you might only know some of
and then a breastfeeding class which I'm
really like that'll be good because I
don't you know if you never breastfed
you don't know anything and I've even
heard like even when you take the class
the real thing is still different I mean
so the nurse at the hospital is also
telling me that you know a lot of
hospitals including them have like after
you've had the baby free breastfeeding
classes you can just go they can even
like they'll waive the baby before and
then you breastfeed in the weight after
to show how many ounces the baby is
actually getting from you I mean there's
so much they can do they can look at how
they're latching and while that all
sounds awkward to me right now I know
that when I'm doing it if I genuinely
need the help I'm hoping that I'm open
to it because you know that's kind of
awkward if you've never done it but I
think by then after having gone through
labor I might be a little more
comfortable in fact kind of stuff I
don't know I guess we'll see my sister
was saying she's like oh Jess you have
no idea those things you're nervous
about now that you feel like will be
awkward she's like you will not care
about in the moment when you're getting
laid so the next step for me right now
we're waiting the classes in a couple
weeks I was hoping it'd be sooner but
the way it all worked out schedule wise
it's in a few weeks so we'll do that and
it's like a big long seven or eight hour
day for Tyler and I but I think that'll
be great to kind of get it done on a
Saturday so the next step is packing our
hospital bags I know I'm only almost 34
weeks and most people wait longer but
you know you could go into labor at any
time and
especially since I have had weird
complications like you know I should
probably be a little more ready so that
I'm working on really this weekend I'm
planning on packing as much as I can
they did tell me at the hospital that
you really don't need a lot for your
baby they have everything there and I
would have to assume many hospitals that
way
she was like you don't need diapers you
don't need wipes you don't need anything
other than maybe if you want cute
outfits to take them home in you know
obviously you'll need your carrier car
seat and stuff but she said but she'll
watch people come in with full diaper
bags and she's like you don't need it
we've got it all so I might pack a few
things here and there just kiss like I
don't know that's just the planner in me
I'm like I want to make sure I have it
like at least I don't know a burp cloth
no so that I'm definitely gonna pack a
little bit but I might just leave it in
the car and then if we need it time to
come right out and get it but odds are
we won't but I'll feel better knowing
it's in there so those are the next
steps if I I'm definitely planning on
doing a what's in my hospital bag type
video because I did just recently buy a
bunch of stuff on Amazon based on a lot
of other recommendations from other
youtubers on like you know specific
nursing tanks that are great on Amazon
and specific you know just very specific
things that are great for your hospital
stay so I will be able to share that
with you guys with links if you're
curious and you're wanting to buy the
exact items because I found that very
helpful as I've been watching a lot of
hospital bag videos so that's my update
for now I'll try to update you as we go
along maybe around 36 week I'm trying to
do it every two ish weeks I don't know
that that's gonna happen but we'll see
and we are planning on vlogging some of
you know we're not gonna vlog the
everything but we are planning to vlog
some of it but that will be on Tyler's
channel so I will link his channel below
if you want to see cuz that's where all
of well most of our vlogs go we're also
planning to do a baby names we're not
using video so stay tuned for that if
it's not already up if it is I will link
it below I think that'll be really fun
