hi guys so here's a quick review of a
new lip product that I found at
Walgreens these are the Fergie well by
wet wild it's the Fergie velvet matte
lip color and I bought two different
shades I have the shade pinky candy and
then the one that I'm wearing is plum
janu like aunjanue but plums janu so the
first shade I'm gonna apply is called
plum janu and it's let's wash it and see
huh they seem very creamy in a way I
mean they just glide right onto my skin
which is good let's just see
they seem kind of splotchy
but they are really velvety smooth
look what just happened it just fell
right out it literally just fell right
out I mean these are really inexpensive
so it's not like it's that big of a deal
but at the same time I'm like seriously
now I'm curious if the other one will do
it yeah yep you've got to be kidding me
let's go ahead and go through the pros
and cons of this product first of all
the price point is great these are 349
which is fantastic and for a matte lip
color that's great they the color
options are pretty good these were
really the only two I was super
interested in so you know it is what it
is but out of the - I liked the plum one
the best which is why I'm wearing it
right now similar products to these
would be like the Revlon bomb stains
that are the matte balm stains that's a
similar application and a similar
packaging these are a little bit thinner
than those for comparison and one huge
downside is that when I open these the
very first time I open them the thing
fell out and then when i swatched them
they were falling out and they were
falling out as I applied them and that
was true for both of them so that was
fun that was so fun so packaging I I
mean they're cute I like even the
packaging is kind of matte and they're
thin but it's falling apart so that is a
big downer it feels like a crayon - I
mean almost exactly the texture is okay
as they are kind of they skip a little
bit they're just not fantastically
creamy and for a matte lip you're you
know there are so many good matte lip
products out there that for to have one
that yes it's inexpensive but it just
skips and it pulls on your lips and it
kind of just honestly I mean look at it
it kind of looks like a kool-aid stain
like I just took kool-aid and did that
it doesn't look the way that I want it
to look it looks kind of sloppy it it
just I didn't find even though it looks
semi pigmented in the swatches I find
that the way it applies its pulling on
my lips it's uneven
there's not an offensive smell or
anything like that so nothing to report
smell wise but like I said pigmentation
and even the swatch on my hand I don't
love these and I don't like the way they
apply they're not very creamy
honestly bang for your buck the jordana
ones these still aren't my favourite and
I've got a review video of these coming
up unless it's already up I'll put the
link below these are the Geordie in a
modern matte there are two up there 249
these are 349 these are better and again
these aren't my favorite but they're
still pretty good and compared to these
they're both matte and those have way
more pigmentation their way creamier
these are it literally feels like you're
taking the crayon and drawing it on your
lips I mean this is the best gonna get I
don't think I can wear these again I
might see if I can return them I don't
know how it feels to wear it it's very
you know it doesn't really come off it
came off just a little bit but so that's
one plus is that it's not really going
anywhere once it's on it is kind of like
a stain in that way it doesn't feel
sticky so you know they feel nice
although if your lips were a little dry
it would feel terrible so that is one
thing if I had any dryness right now it
would really show through with this it
would look really gross so I'm I'm lucky
that right now my lips aren't dry but
typically they are so even typically
look even more hurt like I said where to
buy these if you were interested you can
get them at Walgreens honestly you guys
overall when I recommend this absolutely
not it's they're not worth your money by
the georgiana ones by anything else but
maybelline matte lipsticks are a great
option the revlon matte ones are way
better these are not with your money
don't waste them I am going to return
mine if I can they are horrible
absolutely horrible don't waste your
time seriously you guys please don't
hopefully that review is helpful please
stay tuned for more reviews on tons of
new drugstore products and I'll catch
you guys soon bye everyone a desk and
today I have one of my favorite boxes to
unbox and over the past
year that I've been getting them from
this company
you know I'd liked him when I first got
them but each time I get one I get more
excited because I don't know as I move
closer to being married and living with
Tyler and all that stuff we really like
cooking together so I'm just really
excited to use a lot of the stuff I'm
kind of saving some of it for our future
kitchen like to use once we're together
and living together so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
