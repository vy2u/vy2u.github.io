gonna share with you my 40 really
bordering on 41 week update of being
pregnant didn't think I'd make it here
so certainly I will have had the baby by
now
but I certainly have not ooh and I know
that anyone that makes it this far I'm
so thankful I mean if you've seen my
videos of the complications we've had
during this pregnancy
I am beyond thankful and blessed that
I've even made it this far the baby is
healthy as far as we know she's grown
her growth is so much better so I am
like beyond thankful so please don't
take this as me like complaining about
being pregnant
however being pregnant sucks at the end
oh my gosh it sucks you can't sleep like
symptoms wise right now I can't sleep
very well and the only thing my doctors
told me that I am allowed to take to
help with sleep is benadryl which is
actually very convenient because I also
have really bad seasonal allergies right
now and while I can't take benadryl
during the day because it does make me
sleepy it's kind of worked out that
every once in a while when I'm having
really bad allergies I'll take it and I
sleep really well so that's something
that my doctor's approved so I'm
thankful for that because it has helped
on those few nights but as I'm filming
this we're gonna be induced tomorrow
unless I like go into labor some place
between then and now and if you're
wanting to see the birth and delivery
vlog I know you guys are trying to
hearing about it but we're gonna put it
on Tyler's channel so go check it out
over there and watch both of our social
media because we'll both be posting I am
sure but anyway so sleep has been an
issue but it's gotten better and I'm
trying to I have to nap a little bit
throughout the days because it's it's
too taxing at this point most is just as
my back hurts so I tried a nap a little
earlier in the day so that way I can
still get to bed and we've just been
staying up a little later just by
happenstance cuz we're trying to enjoy
this time it's our first kids it's our
last time to just be the two of us for
quite a while so we're trying to you
know we'll watch a movie together each
night and have dinner and watch shark
tank and eat ice cream because that's
what has become our tradition and it is
an awesome tradition so anyway other
symptoms like I said my back is really
really hurting and I've had this
your thing with like my right hip O'Hare
I don't know if it's cuz the extra
weight or maybe I actually did hurt it
at some point where when I've been up
for a while my right hip just aches and
I'd have to sit down and the other new
thing is my fingers have swelled a
little bit just naturally especially
being this far along in pregnancy it's
more of a concern when you're earlier on
because they think oh maybe you have
preeclampsia or if like every time they
check my blood pressure it's totally
normal but if I had high blood pressure
that could be any way but this far long
it's pretty darn normal to be swollen
from time to time so I've had my wedding
ring off for a while in preparation for
that but I've had I have these really
bad aches in my joints and I was doing a
little research and some people were
saying you can have carpal tunnel just
during pregnancy and it kind of feels
our threat akin away and so I don't know
if that's what I have but I also read
that for a lot of people it went away
right after you had the baby pretty soon
after so I figure I'm not gonna worry
about it unless it like continued on for
weeks after having the baby but it's
just uncomfortable you know like I was
blow-drying my hair today and I'm like
ah like that just doesn't feel good but
and that was news to me because I've
never heard anyone talk about that until
I specifically did research on I'm like
oh apparently that's a thing I feel like
my skin and hair have been fine and I'm
sure the prenatals helped with that but
I also hear that once you have the baby
you know you might lose some hair your
skin might go a little hair where you
know all of that's just so off balance
for a little while so I'm kind of
mentally preparing for that I'm trying
to use really good shampoos and
conditioners there's only so much you
can do you know to prevent or try to and
I figure it kind of comes with the
territory so I'm not I'm not too
concerned about it I'm just mentally
preparing to expect that I might maybe
lose some hair things like that like I
know my sister she lost hair here and so
she had like little baby hairs growing
for quite a while as that hair grew back
so we'll see of course with my crazy
hair would you even notice I don't know
maybe you wouldn't even notice the baby
hairs maybe I'm lucky that I have crazy
here but I laugh cuz a lot of you guys
are like ooh whoo Jessica you are
getting close you've got pregnancy lips
you are so I'm like I guess I don't know
but it's funny cuz I'm like my mirror
right here so I'm like looking at my
lips like I don't feel like they look
that much bigger but then I'll see
videos of me from like way early on in
the pregnancy or before and I'm like
yeah my lips are definitely a little
bigger than normal I did have a few
nights ago
I was trying to sleep and we had gotten
to bed later and I'd had like these
really weird I I think they were
contractions cuz it was it was it felt
it kind of started like a Braxton Hicks
where it was just really tight but then
I would feel it wrapped from my back to
the front as well and it would just you
know kind of menstrual cramps on
steroids if you will and it happened
pretty regularly for about an hour and a
half of my doctor told me at two hours
they've been painful and they've been
regular call me and so I was like okay
I'm I was prepping to call it was like
3:00 in the morning and I told myself
okay if I can fall asleep and it doesn't
wake me up I'm probably fine and I fell
asleep and it they just stopped so and
then of course here I am days later and
it really wasn't so but the last time we
checked I was fully effaced and she's at
the negative 1 or minus 1 position in
kind of the birth canal area and I'm
still only 2 centimeters which is what
I've been for like 2 to 3 weeks so but
she offered inducement if I wanted and I
decided yes because I'm like you know
what at this point she'll be 41 weeks
just about like give or take a day and
like she said the heartbeats good it's
it would be a good time to do it okay
and it makes me feel good that the
doctor will be there cuz it's planned
and all that as well
not that she wouldn't be there otherwise
but doctor I have is really saw after an
amazing and not like she's like sought
after like in the world but I mean like
among the people that know about her
they freaking love her and I really
really love her too and my sister
delivered with her and she was like her
5th kid and she had like three other
doctors and she was like Jessica I'm
telling you there's something special
about this doctor she's amazing so
anyway long story short I love my doctor
and I'm really I'm glad that I'll know
for sure that she'll be there for the
labor and delivery because it is planned
she seems to think that because I am
fully a face and all of that and the
baby's already so low that inducing me
won't really take much I'm hoping that's
true
I'm would hope I'm not jinxing it but I
guess only time will tell
so today obviously I'm filming so I'm
like okay I've got one full day of like
regular life before tomorrow in the
afternoon when we go in so I'm like what
would I want to do to pass the time I'm
like I would want to film because it
makes me happy
keeps my mind off of things and then of
course I'll have a bunch of pre film
that I can share with you guys while I'm
in those first few weeks the throws of
motherhood so I'm so nervous can you
tell
but everything is ready the nurseries
ready if you haven't seen our nursery
tour I will link it I had so much fun
filming that and I'm just happy the
nursery I think it's so cute and it's
exactly what we kind of envisioned and
it's simple but Kitty and but still
neutral and I just I'm really happy with
that but I've done a lot of pregnancy
related videos I've done what's in my
hospital bag if you're curious of course
first time mom hospital bag I packed way
more I know then I need but I do plan to
do a what's in my hospital bag like what
I actually used kind of a video
afterwards cuz I think you know I am
aware that I'm bringing more than I need
so I think it'd be fun to share that
with you guys especially if you're also
pregnant or you later become pregnant
and you are just curious like okay what
do I really need to bring now that
you've gone through it and plus if
anything it'd be helpful for me to film
it while it's fresh on my mind just
because I will genuinely remember what I
actually used so if you want to follow
along with our early stages of having
the baby and being a mom and dad for the
first time we'll certainly be tweeting
about it instagramming about it snapping
about it on all of our social media jam
Beauty 89 for me
Tyler travels TV for him I know that
during the birth and delivery he's he
will probably be on social media a
little bit more than me I mean he's not
gonna be on it while but you know what
I'm saying so if you're wanting more
real-time updates he'll probably have
those because I have I would figure I
might not be in the right mental state
for that I don't know that he will be
honestly either but well-well just gonna
see how this goes but I appreciate all
the prayers and well wishes and positive
vibes anything you send our way we
appreciate all of that positivity and I
really do think it makes a difference I
mean doing you guys I feel like when
people are praying for you or they're
sending you positive vibes I do think
that makes a huge
different so I really appreciate it and
I feel like I can just feel that and so
we're excited to take you guys along the
journey I know some people kind of keep
a lot of this private but we've brought
you guys along on our travels on his
channel we I've I feel like I've gone
through so many life experiences with
you guys kind of by my side like our
wedding and being engaged and just
dating Tyler buying a house like all of
this so I figure why not share this
other big part of our lives with you
guys also we made a totally total side
note but a part of our life we made an
Instagram and a Twitter for Pinocchio
our beagle I'm cracking up posting on
there Tyler but we both post on there
but we're using his Pinocchio voice
which is a very specific voice and
sometimes who chants a sultan levels and
so spelling them is very interesting for
the captions and stuff watch out but
we're having a ball with those social
media so it's it's Pinocchio the Beagle
on Instagram and it's Beagle Pinocchio
on Twitter definitely go follow him he
will be though he will probably walk his
tail or something waft odd but anyway
other than that I will shut up I'm so
excited I'm so terrified but as all
women that have had a baby do they get
through it and you survived so I'm
really excited and really nervous and I
hope you guys will check out the vlog
when we do put it up on his and I will
see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
