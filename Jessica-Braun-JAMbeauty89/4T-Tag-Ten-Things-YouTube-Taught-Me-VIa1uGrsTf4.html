have a tag video for you it was created
by a dear subscriber and I'm also a
subscriber of hers her name is Julie
Hill and it's ten things that YouTube
has taught me and it's the 40 tag 10
things that YouTube has taught me I
think that was clever anyway so I talked
to all of you guys to do it I think this
is so cool and just fun and I haven't
seen any tag videos like this yet so the
first one I thought of when I first
heard about this tag was okay one thing
I learned was to mix foundations with
things so for example like the
foundation I've been using a lot lately
use this covergirl one and you can mix
it with a primer or like a Luminizer or
you can mix it with another foundation
to get your shade to be a little more
correct or if one is really drying you
could mix it with a more moisturizing
foundation to kind of get a perfect mix
so this is what I've been doing lately
and I really like it this is the pixie
flawless beauty primer and these two
together they really are nice and this
is a Luminizer basically so I really
really like that and that was a great
thing that I picked up the second thing
I learned from YouTube was all about
setting sprays I didn't even know these
existed before I started watching
YouTube videos this is one of my
favorites it's the Urban Decay all
nighter in the old packaging I really
like that because it really does make a
huge difference so I guess the main
thing I learned was the power of setting
sprays because when I use one versus one
I don't there's a big difference now
this one just really holds on to your
makeup all day this one for me it's the
mac fix+
this one just adds a little bit of what
do I want to say kind of not luminosity
but just a little bit of doing this so
if you've got a lot of powder enos going
on this gets rid of it and I really
really like it and that's how I end up
using it so yay for setting sprays the
third thing I learned was how to apply
cream blush
I'd always I'd heard about cream blush
but I'd never owned any cuz I was like
how do you get it on like do you just
put it with your fingers and of course
you can do that but the most effective
way that I picked up from YouTube was
using a stipple brush this is one of my
favorites the elf stipple brush from
their studio line than $3
and they're just perfect because you can
dip it in and really get it on and it
ends up being really frankly flawless I
just wish cream blushes stayed on longer
I usually will have to set them with a
powder blush and I'm like well that's
kind of defeating the purpose because I
like the luminosity that a cream blush
typically gives but it just doesn't stay
on as long so anyway
stippling brushes are awesome for that
the fourth thing I learned was all about
skin care and before I started watching
youtube videos I think all I did was I
would just wash my face with dove bar
soap and that was it I don't even think
I put moisturizer on maybe but I really
don't think I did I was really pretty
bad about once I started watching I was
like oh I should wash her eyes then I
was like oh I should like actually
remove my makeup - oh I mean there were
so many different things and of course
with skincare it's also personal because
some people don't need a serum whereas
others might or you know what I mean and
then there's anti-aging when do you
start all this stuff but the main thing
I picked up is that I should do some a
little more for my skin and one of the
biggest things I learned about wear
serums and mostly I mean this is oh yeah
this is this year just argan oil I've
been using this a lot and I really it's
made a lot of difference in my skin and
I really like it it doesn't have to be
josie maran brand i also have the Glo
Naturals brand that I got from vitacost
for really cheap for a big bottle so you
can get really good deals on
hundred-percent argan oil but I really
I've noticed a difference and the other
thing I learned this will be part of the
same one is just to apply your skin care
items from thinnest to thickest so you
would apply a toner and then a serum and
then a you know maybe your eye
moisturizer and then like if you've got
a thick cream lotion that would be the
last step you know things like that and
like I said again they're so personal
and some people put them on in different
orders and that works for them so but
all about skincare I certainly picked up
from YouTube the bid thing how to apply
nail polish now of course minor chipping
but what else is new
I first of all had never used a base
coat I used top coats yeah I did use top
coats but I never really used base coats
and my favorite is the Revlon Colorstay
base coat and it's like $5.99 anywhere
you get it and my favorite top coat
right now is the out-the-door topcoat
and these two together are really nice
but base coat
frankly if I could only use one of the
other I would use a base coat because it
makes a huge difference with how long
your polish will go without shipping
unless you use se in which case there's
just no way around it se always chips on
me but base coat makes a huge difference
and it'll help prevent any staining on
your nails and things like that so yeh I
also oh yes the Beauty Blender was
introduced to me from YouTube which it
probably was for most of us and mine I
used this morning so it's dirty and
moist but this is amazing and it doesn't
have to be Beauty Blender brand there
are a lot of really good dupes the Real
Techniques one I've heard is great but
regardless using a moist sponge to apply
foundation was new to me and I also
learned from YouTube to microwave your
Beauty Blender in like a little bit of
water for 30 seconds to a minute how you
think I usually do 45 seconds and it
gets rid of bacteria that might have
grown so it's a great way to make this
last longer without having bacteria
growing it I thought that was really
cool and then of course you still have
to wash it but I thought that was neat
basically I learned to use alcohol like
in a spray bottle to fix any broken
powder products so it could be a shadow
of blush whatever it is you can break it
all up or just press it down and spray
it and then press it down and it'll dry
back to its original state of course the
shape of it might be different but it
doesn't change the formula at all which
really blew my mind at least it hasn't
for any of the ones I've had to use it
on so I thought that was a really
important tip to include alright number
eight
I can't count number eight I learned to
use a nude or a white liner in your
waterline now I did it today well did I
earlier today yeah I did and I love the
Rimmel scandaleyes and I think it's just
in nude and it's a really it's nude for
me actually it's funny it's a little
darker than my skin tone but these stay
on for a really long time and it's
impressive and they're really cheap they
also have more expensive ones you can of
course splurge on but I really like that
it helps not really I don't think it
necessarily widens your eyes it just
that area right there can get really
pink and this just kind of cancels out
any pink or redness to make you look a
little less tired
I think so maybe a little more wide
wide-eyed in that respect that it makes
you look more awake but I don't know
that it really makes your eyes look like
they're extended maybe it does I don't
know okay another thing I learned was
how to contour I'd heard of it and I
learned about it in makeup classes I
took when I first started college when I
was going for a musical theater and I
learned all about it but I'd never
really done it on an everyday basis and
one of my favorite bronzers I have a lot
of favorites is the hoola bronzer and my
favorite blush is the bare essentials
handy Buki it's just I really like the
shape and I've had it for years and it
works well but just the idea of
contouring for every day was new to me
and I also learned from YouTube how to
use a brush like this to do it as well
but I really like doing this it's just a
little more work so I don't do it as
often that was just the brush that came
with the hoola bronzer but there's also
like the NARS eita or Ida brush that's
that same shade that's sold out
everywhere that's a million dollars but
regardless you can also use things like
that okay and the last thing I learned
about from YouTube was cleaning brushes
with bar soap I'd used baby shampoo for
a long time and I still do but you can
also use bar soap and it really can work
in there dove so like the sensitive one
I think it's really nice now I don't
know how it would affect it you know
over time like if it would eventually
dry the brush is that more I don't think
that it would cuz it's really sensitive
but it works really well and if you're
looking for an alternative to like the
Beauty Blender solid bar you could
always use really sensitive bar soap
anyway so hopefully that was fun for you
like I said I tagged all of you guys to
do it I think this video is just fun it
should really make its way around
because it's a really cool tag and I
think it's kind of fun to see what
people knew beforehand and what they've
learned and plus is a great way to share
10 new tricks with you guys maybe you've
heard of all of them maybe you have it
but let me know if you don't make videos
please let me know down below some
things that YouTube has taught you
because I think that's gonna be really
fun for all of us to read and I'll catch
you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
