gonna do a review of the Beauty Blender
and a Beauty Blender dupe yay
because Beauty blenders aren't expensive
okay so let's introduce you first to the
Beauty Blender if you don't know what it
is I know a lot of you do these are
Beauty blenders it's a specific brand
called Beauty Blender and this is when
it's dry and this is when it's moist and
you're supposed to use it when it is wet
and you just run it under the sink and
squeeze it and it'll just kind of
squeeze out excess water so you've got a
nice moist one but you don't want it too
wet so it definitely grows in size when
it's wet and I use this one this morning
that's how I applied my foundation today
these run about $20 apiece
however on Amazon and I'll link the
seller if I can find it I bought a two
pack of these for about like $21 I think
so it was way more bang for your buck it
made so much more sense it might have
been like 22 but either way totally more
worth it now I'm not sure that every
seller on Amazon isn't out to scam you
because there might be some that it's
not the real Beauty Blender but these
were so if I can find that seller I will
definitely definitely link it below for
you guys because it's a great deal
anyway so that's what these look like
the shape they're flat on the bottom you
apply your foundation with this side I
usually adopt my foundation on and then
use this to blend it and then I use this
side for my concealer and I get put the
concealer on and then I just stipple it
and it is absolutely flawless with this
absolutely now the London Soho Beauty
Blender they might call it a beauty
sponge I don't have the packaging if I
can find a picture of what this looks
like in the packaging I will show you it
right now okay so the shape is sort of
similar it has two pointy ends however
which you can use for your concealer and
then you would use the flat side of it
for your foundation or at least that's
how I have used it and again you get it
moist the same way it grows a little bit
it doesn't grow as substantially as this
one does however this one ranges it's
about I would say it's about
six to eight dollars depending on where
you pick it up maybe even as cheap as
five and of course you sometimes find
sales feel wise these feel the same as
the dry Beautyblender and this one the
london sell one is dry right now i know
it's a little dirty they feel the same
i've tried or at least like played with
a lot of the ones that like marshals
will sell on t.j.maxx they have a few
different brands bella beauty is one i
think of and they don't quite feel
exactly the same now i will say this one
the london some is a little bit denser
so listen to this ok listen to the
beauty blender it's not it might not be
that much of a difference and i don't
even know if that's gonna come across
but it is a difference however they do
feel the same when you get them wet this
still the london someone stays it's not
quite as well do you see the water come
out of it it's not quite as squishy I
know it's a silly more but it's not
quite as squishy the London Soho ones so
the Beautyblender a lot squishy are a
lot easier to work with I think and for
me I like holding it this way whereas
this kind of feels odd to me and that
might be because I've gotten used to the
beauty blender but this just feels so
much more comfortable for blending for
getting it into the skin and like I said
this one still stays pretty dense while
it's wet so it's still not as easy to
push it into the skin so that being said
I also think this shape curves around
your you know face a lot easier than
this one doesn't you got to kind of I
don't know it works still bottom line is
I would say if you have the money buy a
2 pack of beauty blenders they'll last
you a while I know I ripped this one
actually you can see like glue I ripped
this one but that was because the way I
was cleaning it I was not being very
smart I was being a little rough with it
however this one seems pretty tough I
don't know but it is cheaper so if you
don't have the money through a beauty
blender I would say the London Soho one
is gonna be as close as you can get to
the beauty butter it's not quite the
same the finish it's not as flawless
it's still pretty good though but it's
not as flawless as when you
the Beautyblender just period I mean
that's what I'll say about it but again
if you don't have the money which I
understand get the London Sowell one
it's pretty darn good but if you do have
the $20 just bear by D's they'll last
you a long time and the 2-pack is a way
better deal than the one pack especially
if you can find a deal like on Amazon so
that is my comparison if you know of any
great dupes that you really really like
please describe them below maybe even
link it below if you can in the comment
box I don't know if you can you leave
links in the comment box I don't know I
don't think you can't anyway but let me
know I hope this was a helpful helpful
video for you guys I know it was kind of
exciting to try these out but I still
love the Beautyblender and I use it
absolutely every day over brushes or
anything like that I love it for
foundation and concealer so it's a life
changer if you have the money spend it
but anyway I hope this was helpful and
I'll talk to you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
