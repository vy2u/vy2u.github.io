share with you five rediscovered
favorites from my collection I'm kind of
getting into that mindset of using
products I already have and while I
still buy new products because that's my
job I like to review things I've kind of
felt recently I'm like you know I've
been buying a lot a lot a lot a lot and
reviewing a lot la huh and I'm kind of
like forgetting about my old favorites
and so these are five products I pulled
together I actually had more I had like
eight maybe even ten looking over there
but I decide I was like you know what
what are the top five like five things
I'm like oh my gosh how could I forget
this was so good so I wanted to narrow
down curate it a little bit so that way
it really is five products I absolutely
adored that I completely forgot like I
just have forgotten to use for some of
these like a year like that's crazy
they've just been sitting my collection
some of them are recent repurchases
because I just haven't had them in a
long time so we've got two drugstore
three high-end kind of a mix you know
let's go ahead and get into it so let's
sort the drugstore one rediscovered
favorite will be no surprise to some of
you this is the Rimmel lasting finish
now some lovely Canadian subscribers
have sent me ones with the pump in my
shade which is 100 ivory it's probably a
little dark for me well on camera it
looks pretty good I don't have it on
right now actually just if you're
curious where do I have it I have the
new Rimmel I can find it the new Rimmel
lasting finish breathable so this is the
original this is the breathable the
breathable is okay it's okay I had to
add a lot of powder foundation and other
stuff to make all of this look okay
this stuff however oh my gosh it's got
such good coverage I love that the
Canadian ones have a pump thank you guys
but there's something about this like I
just love it and I don't know why more
people aren't talking about it I always
use a sponge I've done it with the brush
and it looks okay it just looks better
with the sponge I love using my L'Oreal
sponge and it's just really good
coverage it looks so
on the skin it does have a smell that
can bother I mean it's a strong smell
it's one that I'd kind of took me a
little while to get used to and I wish
it didn't have that smell it I like it
now cuz I have gotten used to it now I
can connect it to this foundation that I
love but it wears so beautifully
throughout the day and it doesn't seem
to matter what primer I'm wearing so
that's one that I rediscovered I bought
another one Ivan started talking about
and then like I said a lot of you guys
have sent me ones with the pump so it's
so so awesome another one this is from
essence so this is their lash princess
mascara I had bought I had talked about
this for months and months and months I
loved it so much like a year ago maybe
even a year and a half ago and then I
started getting into some other ones and
then I discovered the Maybelline lash
paradise where's that L'Oreal brand make
slash paradise I genuinely can't think
of it is it Laurie oh I don't even think
I have one right now which is actually
really sad because it is my favorite but
anyway I love that stuff that it dries
out so quickly so finally I was like you
know what Jessica you have a backup of
this it was brand new so I opened it
day one of opening it my lashes were
curled and black and defined and
lengthen I mean everything you want to
mascara this does at you know under five
dollars this mascara is so so good I
specifically like the one with the lime
green or the mint green the false lash
effect cuz they have a couple lash
princesses this is my favorite and the
packaging is actually really cute so the
wand is more of a natural bristle wand
just kind of tapers to a point I mean
it's very simple but it is so good it's
so good I love it so I'm so glad that
this is back in my life again and this
one doesn't dry out nearly as quickly as
that lash paradise which is very nice
saves you some money another rediscovery
are the well I'll do this one this is
the laura mercier secret brightening
powder this thing is so dirty I've like
had this for so long I've used it to
death for a long time and like I said I
just kind of forgot about it it's
probably about half gone now because
I've been using it like crazy so I've
realized something I used to use this
with a sponge and what I use it for is
my under eyes so I'll put on my
concealer blend it in and then those
little areas where I have my little fine
lines and creeks
I used to take my you know damp sponge
dip it in this and put it on there kind
of baked and then brush it away that
looks pretty good but I stopped using it
I was like you know I feel like I don't
really need all of that I feel like it's
a lot well I finally recently have
started to kind of blend in get the
concealer out of the fine lines and then
I'll just use a small brush and just
kind of go just in that area it
brightens it it fills in those areas so
that your concealers not as easily going
to creep into those fine lines now
anytime I'm putting a powder on my under
eye it's going to make it's going to age
you a little bit but this does it the
least amount especially with the loose
powder I've tried many many under eyes
setting products whether it's like a
pressed powder or a loose powder so many
of them look crazy but this is one that
I have recently fallen back in love with
because it really does a nice job of
brightening and kind of setting that
area but it doesn't make me look crazy
old I wish I'd used it today today I
used another new product from the
essence brighten up powder and I do not
like it it really really ages me if you
could see it up close you'd be like oh
my gosh but I really I I love this stuff
so much so another rediscovered favor
are these cover FX custom cover jobs
I actually just bought another shade on
HauteLook for half off cuz they'll have
random brands on there 50% off I can
link it below so I had originally bought
in 10 you know long ago from Sephora
Ulta wherever so the idea of this is
it's just a multi-use pigment drop so
it's a very very thin formula
you usually shake it up they have lots
and lots of colors and the idea is that
it can help you either create your own
foundation by maybe it's like taking the
moisturizers I'm putting this in it and
rubbing that all over but the way I use
it is actually to change the color of
foundation so a lot of foundations are
either too light or too dark for me so
it's a very very thin thin formula
highly highly pigmented I mean that I
could just keep going and that would
just keep covering so like using this
alone I wouldn't recommend like I don't
think I've ever done that but I like to
mix it with the foundation I'll put like
one drop in kind of mix
my hands see how it looks maybe add
another if I need to lighten it a little
bit more so that's what I use intend for
and it does such a nice job and I forgot
I own these and they were kind of hidden
in a corner of my drawer and I'm
constantly frustrated like oh I ordered
the wrong shade oh well then I was like
wait a minute what are you doing Jessica
or like oh this is just a little bit too
dark but they don't have a shade that
works for me I'm like Jessica that's
literally why you own these so I have
used these so much the past few months
because it like empowered me to be able
to use all these foundations that I
forgot I could totally use if I could
just adjust the shade so I bought
another one like I said these were half
off on her look and this one's darker
it's in 25 and I figured this would be
good for for my skin tone for darkening
a ooh I should have shaken that up
definitely shake them up for darkening
maybe a foundation that's just way too
light now it's pretty rare to get some
that are too light for me but I figured
since it was half off I would probably
still use it enough to make it worth it
because there are some lines that like
they'll have two shades near me but once
way to lighten once way too dark and
anyway so I figured that's pretty good I
could probably mix these two colors and
get like the perfect shade if I really
wanted to as well so do I think you need
more than one not really if you know
that typically the foundations you get
are just a little too dark then get one
lighter for you you know there's a lot
you can do but I just the versatility
and power you have with these I think is
amazing and it makes it absolutely worth
it but I don't think you need more than
one I'm just a brat and I wanted to last
rediscovered favorite and this was
actually rediscovered because some of
you guys had commented on like Instagram
or something I don't even member maybe
even snapchat asking like hey Jess could
you still use those do you recommend
them and it's these Kevin of Quan
sculpting powders so my original love
was the one in medium and it's like a
contour powder very cool gray tone and
there it is there it's like been a it's
been a makeup artist PHA for a long time
it blends really really well
stays on the skin it's the perfect tone
if you're my skin tone well then he came
out with a light and it's just a little
bit lighter
again still a contour powder but what
I've realized is it's not that it's this
is the light one it's less than it's
lighter it's more than it's just a
totally different tone and the more i've
swatched them next to each other the
more I realize it but I still love both
of these powders now if I were to
recommend one I think I'm always torn
but the medium one really is more coal
tone and the light really is more warm
yeah it's just kind of interesting to me
and the more I think about I'm like you
know that kind of defeats the purpose
anyway regardless you've got to know
your own skin tone to decide but I think
like if I lost both of these and I
repurchased want I think I would
probably repurchase the medium just
because it really when I'm looking for
this I'm not looking for a warm tone
bronzer I really am if I'm reaching for
this I really want a gray tone contour
so that's something to kind of keep in
mind with those but they stay on really
well throughout the day they're so
beautiful they blend so well if I ever
get too much on I'll grab like if I used
a sponge to get ready that morning I'll
grab that with that little bit of
leftover foundation and just kind of
blend that area and it looks so
beautiful you could also blend it in
with like some powder foundation because
that would add just a little bit more
coverage to make the area look more
seamless unless maybe splotchy but I
don't notice that these products look
splotchy anyway but you know you never
know it could depend on the primer you
had underneath or the foundation if it's
not super high coverage whatever so
those are my recent five rediscovered
favorites if you'd like me to do this
kind of video maybe more often I would
love to because I'm sure that every few
months I'd be able to pull out some
products that I'm using again that I
used to love and it's just a nice way to
breathe some life into some products
that I have had for a long time but that
I genuinely use and love now again so I
would love for any of you guys to do
this kind of video if you do definitely
let me know I'd love to watch it and I
hope you'll subscribe before you leave
and I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
