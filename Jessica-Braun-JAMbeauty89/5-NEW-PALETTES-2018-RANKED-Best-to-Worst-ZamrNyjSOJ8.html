gonna share with you five brand-new
pallets from the past few months that
have been released and my thoughts on
them I thought it'd be more fun to rank
these so I'm gonna I don't I don't do
this often on my channel because it's
hard to rank things and the reality is
as I'm ranking these you'll see that
there are some that I'm like oh but this
does this better than this palette even
though I ranked this palette higher it's
hard to rank pallets when they're not
all exactly the same when it comes to
the shades and my tastes and makeup
versus what your tastes might be so I'm
ranking them kind of more for fun but
I'm gonna share with you guys all the
details I can about all of these
palettes that I own why I think they you
know should be ranked where they are but
keep in mind that it's my own personal
preference versus yours and if you like
certain shades or you've already tried
take it with a grain of salt I guess is
what I'm saying it's just make it so the
palettes I'm going to be talking about
I'm gonna try to tell them to you in a
random order so you don't know the
ranking yet and I'm gonna mix them up in
the description box too just to really
throw you off so we're gonna be talking
about the Too Faced white peach palette
we're gonna talk about the Anastasio
soft glam palette we're gonna talk about
the Urban Decay backtalk palette you're
gonna Katy make it petite heat and this
is even newer the pixie let's talk eyes
palette with Whaley here on YouTube so
I'm gonna rank these here we go number 5
is the Urban Decay backtalk palette this
I do like now you've probably heard a
lot of people complain about the
packaging of this this you can open and
there's the blush side and you can open
and there's the I shout outside no
problem
however this middle console if you will
is actually a mirror that comes out so
you can't shut this truly without it
which you know not that big of a deal
except for its annoying it's just kind
of annoying like even just then I just
put it in and it's not right apparently
because it won't magnetized shut and of
course we all know how magnets work but
on top of that it is kind of cool
because when you put the mirror in there
and actually will stay upright like if
you needed to do your makeup so there
are some pluses to it but it is just a
little bit of an annoyance
it depends on your own personal taste I
don't know why they could enough I mean
I guess I could just glue the mirror in
you know what I mean
I guess anyway I'm not gonna go to all
that trouble but this one's number five
I really really like the blushes in this
palette I really do I would not mind if
these were in their own palette you know
what I mean
the my favorite shade is double take
it's a really pretty kind of dusty rose
color it's matte and then we have more
of a satin one called cheap shot it's
definitely got a purpley kind of berry
tone to it then there's low key which is
more of a peachy shade with some golden
shimmers and it's definitely less
pigmented color wise when it comes that
peach more almost highlighting but it's
still really pretty but it's it's
definitely doesn't swatch as if it's a
blush and then this party foul which is
a highlight and it's really really
pretty a little bit deep for my skin
tone but would look gorgeous on some
with a deeper skin tone I like this side
of the palate then we get to the shadow
side a mats are really pretty I really
like the shade back top it matches their
lipstick called backtalk which I
actually I know that formula is really
drying on my lips so I don't love it
I've got since gotten rid of that color
but gorgeous eye shadow gosh it almost
looks like a blush I mean you totally
could use it as a blush if only that pan
were you know the size of an eyeshadow
yeah it's the shimmers that really let
me down in this they were just men they
were just meant I feel like I couldn't
get that pop that I wanted and so then I
was finding myself reach for that
highlight and that was okay but I'm
thinking you know if they can make a
highlight that good why aren't they I
know urban decay makes eyeshadows really
well why aren't these shimmers as
amazingness like they are in the naked
palettes and it you know and I think
that's what threw me is I'm like huh I
know they know how how to do this why
did they not do that this in this
palette but they do have some really fun
kind of funky colors to play off of that
light pink and these like for example
this shade which was attitude gorgeous
sleeping
the next one shade literally called
shave is a little bit more patchy now
can you build these up with fix+ and
spray sure but that's not really the
point when I'm comparing it to these
other ones I'm going to show you I feel
like this one just kind of paled in
comparison when it came to its quality
now if you are obsessed with these kinds
of colors and you know you're gonna wear
it and especially with the blushes go
for it because I don't think it's like a
horrible palette it's just not one that
I would say yes go spend forty six
dollars on this right now it's amazing I
couldn't say that about this and good
conscious so well I do think it's nice I
I could see myself eventually declutter
ingush maybe sooner rather than later
because I don't foresee myself reaching
for this very much I'm forcing myself to
use right now and I'm not really
enjoying next up is the Too Faced white
peach I'm drinking this one number four
but this was hard for me they recently
sent this to me and so I've been using
it off and on here's the thing I know a
lot of people don't like this palette I
actually really like this palette but
there are a few things I would have done
differently maybe I mean I'm not I don't
want to make a company obviously but so
the idea of this is that it's you know
those lighter peach colors listen I am a
fair-skinned gal who likes light neutral
looks this palette is totally up my
alley
totally and the packaging holy moly they
always nail it just like their peachy
Maps one absolutely high-quality
gorgeous I wish every palette was made
in this kind of packaging I love it but
while I think these mats are absolutely
stunning
soft creamy easy to blend beautiful it's
the shimmer see that yet again are kind
of letting me down
they don't have any in between they have
these couple of crazy glittery colors I
put this on my eye the other day and I
was like wow I mean it's definitely
punchy and if you use like a setting
spray on it as well like woah but
there's so much fallout even with
glitter glue there just is and so I'm
finding that I okay then I'll
I look before my foundation but then
even throughout the day as I'm just
living life and blinking my eyes you
know like humans do
I'll get little bits here and there and
I'm like you know it's not really worth
futzing with when I could grab like for
example a color pop shadow these are
incredibly inexpensive and the glitter
is kind of trapped in there so that way
and it's more of a gel like cream so if
I were to Pat that on top that's not a
good comparison because it's a totally
different color I don't have fallout for
these because I'm tapping it on and it's
locking into place so anytime I want in
glitter I always reach for something
like this or a cream shadow not a
powdery one because there's no point in
going through the trouble when there's
better things out there for teeth so I
was a little bummed about those shades
but I still find myself reaching for
this all the time because of those
gorgeous mattes they do have this shade
glistening peach that's really similar
to that white but it's not quite as
punchy and again there's the gold
glitter that just kind of falls the only
other like shimmery ones is creme Dilip
each and peaches and dreams and peaches
and dreams is really pretty but it's not
like a crazy shimmer and neither is
Kundel a peach there's just like glitter
in it so I don't know what they were
thinking if they're marketing towards
people that like more natural light
looks
they probably I shouldn't say probably
cuz obviously not everyone is this way
but odds are they're not gonna want
these chunky Glary shades you know what
I mean so for that reason I ranked it
number 4 now this I do obviously like
better than backtalk I'm reaching for it
I'm enjoying using it it's just that I
felt like I wanted a little bit more out
of it when it comes to the shimmers
number three is the urban decay sorry I
felt like this drawer was open so I felt
like I needed only reach behind it was
closed number three is the Urban Decay
Naked petit key now the story of this is
when I received the Urban Decay Naked
heat pad not the petite one but the
full-on I just didn't love it I passed
it on to one of my best friends cuz I
was like deal get more use out of it I
just again it's one of those things I'm
trying to be better about in my life is
if I tried it and I know I don't really
care about
I'm gonna pass it on now versus you know
I might talk about in a video or two and
then get rid of it because there's no
reasonable Don do it
well this was the answer to those
prayers because I have gotten more into
warm looks but now I feel like I'm kind
of moving towards a couple more cooler
tongue looks but I still wanted to have
some warm stuff in my collection this is
perfect
it's very their own map it's like the
best kinds of colors from that palette
where you kind of have a range we have
some lighter colors like brow bone kind
of crease colors and then deeper colors
if you wanted to line with them or do
outer corner you know smudging smoky all
of that but they're all really nice I
find that these blend really nicely
the colors complement each other so well
the colors can stay true to their color
if you want but you can continue to
blend to get it to soften as well which
I personally like because I'm not a
makeup artist my looks don't always look
perfect so this is one that I honestly
just didn't think I would like and I
ended up really surprising myself and
how much I actually really do like it so
I would recommend this one especially if
these colors are up your alley if
they're not then don't because if you
know yourself don't get it just kiss a
lot of other people are like oh it's
great if you're going to use it don't
find it and I know sometimes you just
need to hear someone tell you that but I
can be that person for you that's not
colors you're going to wear don't bite
number two is the pixie and Whaley
palette this is sold at Target and
online it came with a liner that I
haven't tried yet i've swatched it and
it's incredibly black so if you buy the
little kit holy moly
so this palette is let's see three matte
colors and two really shimmery colors
and then one kind of more satiny
shimmery these are incredibly soft
incredibly pigmented they blend really
well every I look I've done with this
I've gotten so many compliments on
people but oh my gosh your eyeshadow
looks so pretty too like X
pretty damn like thanks thanks guys
it's this it's so gorgeous these
shimmers are beautiful on their own on
the lid if you're just wanting a simple
look a lot of mornings I'll just grab
one of these two shades Pat it onto my
lid kind of fluff it into the crease and
that's it because a I wish I had the
kind of time to always do I looks like
full but also it just looks nice it
looks really soft and romantic and
pretty and it looks nice throughout the
day plus free and so this is one that
kind of took me by surprise and I don't
know why I'm that surprised because I
was saying in another video how much
pixie has stepped up their game and like
they're blowing so many of the more
expensive companies out of the water I
hope they keep the price point I still
think the price points a little pricey
but it's certainly not like forty fifty
dollars and so I hope it I hope they
stay in that range this is amazing it's
really really nice you guys anyway we
did an amazing job on this my number one
this was something that had very mixed
feelings when I reposted this on my
Instagram like when they were first
showing what it looked like and I was
asking this like what do you guys think
like I think I really liked it and it
was truly split down the middle this was
a very polarizing product half the
people were like oh my gosh
I love it it looks amazing I can't wait
to try it and the other half were like
no those colors are so boring so I think
this is a total cup of tea kind of a
thing is this your cup of tea this is my
truly my cup of tea this is what I'm
wearing on my eyes today so the palette
I think it's cool as heck it's this kind
of beige color with their white listen
these palettes get so dirty it drives me
crazy but they're so pretty but they get
so dirty so when I looked at this I
thought oh these are a bunch of colors I
can actually wear and I don't have to
worry about them looking crazy because
they're too dark or just because I'm so
fair and it's so dark so obviously they
have a mix of shades they've got some
true glitters to be quite candid it's
these two here I don't really use very
often again for that same reason I
mentioned before there's fallout there's
glitter it
it's not worth the work it's everything
else on the palate that I love so I'm
like okay I can ignore those two and I
have used them they're certainly less
chunky I I guess I I miss P I'm miss
speaking these are not chunky like the
two-faced ones in the white peach these
are more they are creamier it kind of
holds the glitter in there but I still
do notice a little bit of fog nothing
like those palettes they had in between
what were they called
like the subculture everyone's freaking
out not that bad not even close but
anyway I am wearing glistening which is
like this light gold on my lid today and
I'm wearing tempura or tempura I use
everywhere I used on my brow bone it's
like the best shape and then dusty rose
is one of my absolute favorites I'm
wearing that in the outer corner I used
orange soda to blend it all kind of
together in the crease and then what Oh
mulberry oh my gosh I use mulberry to
line my eyes today and I don't typically
do lighter liner looks like I usually do
black eyeliner a thick gel line liquid
liner a wing I didn't put any liner on
except for this color mulberry and I
just use kind of a liner brush to kind
of do my lower lash line and up above
and that's it and then throughout
mascara I Eve done the same thing with
noir the black shade these shadows stay
in place they blend beautifully this
shade rose-pink is also gorgeous these
Browns these blends so beautifully this
was one of the best purchases I've made
in a very long time because I get
excited to use it I just love it I love
the looks that I feel like I'm getting
not really out of my comfort zone but
I'm certainly trying little things here
and there
because the quality of these shadows is
so great so those were my ranking of 5
newer palettes that are out right now
