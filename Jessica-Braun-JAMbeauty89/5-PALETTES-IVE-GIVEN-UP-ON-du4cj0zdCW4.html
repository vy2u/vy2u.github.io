sharing with you a very sad video I have
some pallets I've given up on i'm
decluttering them for one reason or
another it's not a bunch it's just a
couple I'm kind of in a pallet
Renaissance right now where I feel like
I found so many pallets I love this is
genuinely these are the only pallets I
want to get rid of so I thought about
doing a whole declutter brother like I
know which ones I'm getting rid of one
of them I'm actually returning and the
rest I've had for long enough and I've
got reasons why I'm like you know what I
think it's time I think it's time I
genuinely it's weird I you get kind of
emotionally attached and when I get to
two of the ones I'm getting rid of I'm
like like no I shouldn't but I'm like
Jessica you're not using them it is time
so I hope that this inspires you to pull
out some palettes even though they might
be 50 dollar palettes
if you know in your heart that you are
not using them and they have sat there
for way too long and like you'll pull it
out you know maybe I'll use it today and
then you never do anyway it's time to
get rid of it pass it on to a sister or
a friend or someone that you know might
actually love it if you enjoyed this
kind of video definitely subscribe check
out my whole declutter playlist I've got
years of declutter --zz where I show all
of my products in a category go through
and get rid of like a lot so if you want
to see those I'll link the playlist
otherwise let's go ahead and get into it
first one this is the one I'm returning
I very recently bought this this is the
visa or Vizier golden hour palette now
this is not one that I was like
disappointed in the quality okay this is
one that I was like you know what this
is just not different enough when I
compare it to all the other palettes I
already have so it's the visi art
shadows are gorgeous absolutely gorgeous
I have another one of their palettes
they're like neutral matte and it's so
beautiful it blends amazingly but I just
felt like about this palette you know
what I mean it's got the right kinds of
mattes it's got everything you might
need but I just didn't feel like any
time I did a look with it I was like
yeah like I can do that with every other
palette and I thought okay Jessica pause
for that price point you should be like
oh my gosh I love this palette so much
and so I thought okay
what's gonna happen if I end up keeping
this palette because I'm in the window
where I can still return it and I even
still have the box if I keep this
palette what's going to happen is it's
going to move to my palette drawer it's
gonna sit there for a year and then a
year from now I'm gonna do a video like
this and I'm gonna declutter it why not
get your money back so that you can
actually save it put it towards another
palette you genuinely would use like
there's no point in keeping it so I was
a very good girl and I've decided you
know what I'm going to return it even
though it's a visa busy art v's art I
don't know how to say it clearly
I've tried um I just I don't know like
I'll swatch a few for you um they're
pretty they are I mean there's no
doubting that but I just feel that's a
gold shade there just feel underwhelmed
I guess let me do like a mattes you can
see there so blendable but again it's
just not different enough I did like the
packaging another palette that I wish I
had returned long ago
is this narcissus palette it's they're
loaded I shadow palette I bought this
myself and I just don't like this
palette like I just don't I don't think
the quality of the shadows is nearly as
good as like their other palettes now do
they swatch pretty well yeah do they
blend very well not really I mean it's
okay but I felt like every time I've
used it I felt like I was forcing myself
to use it and I'm like you know these
are neutrals that I like but I just I
don't know there's something about this
combination and like the looks I would
do it that I just feel very like like I
could have done that with an elf palette
just fine and I thought okay this is
like 50 or 60 I like it's not cheap and
every time I see it I feel this like
paying of guilt like you bought that and
you never use it and you don't like it
and so I'm like you know what I'm gonna
pass this on to someone else I know one
of my sisters would actually love and
use this and at least then it'd be given
some love because I hate hate seeing it
in that drawer and feeling that feeling
every single morning like oh why did I
buy it so I'm gonna move on get rid of
the freaking guilt
pass that guilt on to someone else all
right next palette this might surprise
you that I'm getting rid of this one
this has been a favorite of mine it's
the NYX perfect filter palette in all of
you I just I think that the quality of
the shadows was actually really good and
that's why I've talked so much about
them like oh my gosh I love this shade
here they have mattes they have some
shimmers there was like one really does
shade there this like weird kind of
greenish color it's just weird it's very
spotty but I just don't ever use it and
you know I would
I used it one of the first few months I
bought it and that's why I talked about
videos because I really do like it I
think it's a good palette but this is
one that I'm getting rid of not because
I don't use it but sorry not because I
don't like it but because I just don't
use it and again it's just gonna sit in
there and sit in there and sit in there
and I don't know I just I feel bad
looking at it I'm like I know that's
such a good palette but I'm just not
using it so that's I'm passing on four
good reasons to share the love with it
but again alright next one I'm getting
rid of is this lorac pro 3 palette I
wasn't sure if I was gonna declutter
this I feel like I got this one in the
last year and I really liked it and I
actually just filmed a video about
products I changed my mind on and this
is one I changed my mind on do I think
the mattes are gorgeous yes the row of
shimmers is really nice there is the
crummy shade medallion that is just a
really patchy bad chunky shade but every
look I do what this looks the same it's
a very muted palette and you know I
found one look I really liked I think I
did a video on it but that's like the
only look I can pull off because no
matter what I put on they all blend
together and they look the same and so
then I just wasn't reaching for it when
I did again I feel like I'm forcing
myself to use it I'm like why Jessica
your job is to try other palettes or
well sure but to try lots of makeup and
if there's one that you're just feeling
underwhelmed by then pass it on so I'm
really sad like this as you know I've
given it plenty of love but it's just
kind of that point where I'm just not
even enjoying using anymore so there's
too many palettes in the see Jessica
move on the last one I'm getting rid of
and this is the one
does kind of make me emotional it's on
the same vein it's the original lorac
Pro so many people love this and this is
one of those palettes that I am like
Jessica use it everyone else loves it
why don't you love it
it is really good there's nothing wrong
with the quality I just don't like using
it I don't know what it is about it like
I don't know if it's the formula maybe
it's the form of these that maybe I
don't like the formula for myself I
don't enjoy using it and it's never to
say I mean these blend well so at the
end of the day it's not like an ugly
look but there's something about the the
formula that I just don't like enjoy the
process of putting it on I can't
describe it
and I think when I kind of realized that
that's what it is I felt a little bit
better about passing it on it's the
weirdest thing I know so many people
love lorac shadows I just don't think I
like them I don't know how else to
describe it and so my advice then you
know regarding both of these is you know
I spent my own money on these these were
not none of these were sent to me in PR
and you know I'm getting to know myself
so now I know okay Jessica you don't
like lorac shadows don't buy any more
lorac palettes I just recently got rid
of the lorac pro 2 and I remember
thinking I'm like maybe I should just
get rid of those and like no no keep it
but again I would feel that pang of
guilt every time I saw these in there
because I knew they weren't getting used
and they were eventually going to go bad
so I'd rather pass all of these on
before they go bad so that someone else
can enjoy them because obviously none of
these are horrible quality I hope this
video was helpful maybe more less of a
you know like I said none of these
products were absolutely horrible so it
wasn't really a product I regret buying
well no I guess it was it wasn't a
disappointing products it was more of it
just kind of regrets more because of who
I am and how I like my shadow to look or
just how I enjoy shadows to apply things
like that so I hope this inspired you to
look in your palette drawer or any
drawer and any of those products in
there that you feel guilty looking at
get rid of them get rid of it you don't
need that negativity in your life so
anyway I hope that you'll check out some
of my other declutter video
and I will see you guys in my next one
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
