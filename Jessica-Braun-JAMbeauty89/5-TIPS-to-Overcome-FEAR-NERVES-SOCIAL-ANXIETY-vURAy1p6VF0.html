gonna do kind of a different video for
my channel it was one that I was
thinking up while I was giving my
students a standardized test I was
sitting there and you know you're just
kind of monitoring the test and my mind
is thinking cuz there's nothing else to
do and I thought of this because
something that I struggle with
personally and I have for a long time
but I finally feel like I've kind of
gotten a hold of it is stress and
anxiety now I don't mean anxiety like
clinical kinds of levels of anxiety and
things like that because that's not what
I've dealt with but I guess what I mean
more so is like be nervous and being a
little bit anxious in social situations
or you know nervous about things you've
never done before like whether you're
starting a new job or you're going out
to a social event where you know you're
not gonna really know anyone or you know
whatever it may be maybe you're nervous
to ask your boss for a raise cuz that's
not something you're comfortable with
doing there's so many things in our
lives that just stress us out you know
I'm now I'm feeling stressed about this
turtleneck right now oh it's too tight
getting the neck thing okay anyway so I
wanted to kind of touch on this and I
kind of developed five tips that I feel
like I kind of live by and it was it
took me a while to kind of put these
into words and kind of separate them and
compartmentalize them but I think I
finally done it and I wanted to share
that with you guys today if you enjoy
this kind of a video where I'm kind of
giving my own little bits of life advice
I mean I'm only 29
I only know as much as I know you know
but I'm always in pursuit of learning
more and I know most of us are so all of
us are um so if you like these kinds of
videos and you'd like to see more please
let me know below give it a thumbs up
comment below maybe if you have ideas of
topics you'd like me to talk about I
feel like I should call this a like a
jam session or you know cuz Jam Beauty
any night or like I don't know I'm
trying to think of something with the
literation like Jessica's John's but
John's doesn't make sense but you know
just kind of these chatty videos where I
want to just talk to you about things
about life not just makeup and stuff
tip number one ask yourself will this
thing this event or whatever it might be
will this matter tomorrow or will it
matter in a week or in a month or in
five years because when you start to
really think about this moment or this
event in the grand scheme of things it's
so inconsequential it doesn't matter so
whether you're nervous about asking your
boss for that race or you're nervous
about starting a new job and meeting new
people or going to a social event in the
grand scheme of things it doesn't matter
it's a blink of an eye it'll be over
with and for whatever reason that
mindset that question always sits in the
back of my head when I start to feel
nervous and it nips it in the bud pretty
quickly because I'm always like you're
right
it'll be over and it won't matter you
know what I mean it'll matter in its own
way cuz maybe you make a new friend or
maybe you do get that race but that
anxiety you're feeling is serving no
purpose for you it's you know what I'm
saying it's not helping you at all and
so I think just keeping that question in
your mind that this is not gonna matter
in a week I'm not gonna be thinking
about this anymore
in a month it'll be in the past that's
something that for me has helped a lot
on that same vein tip number two and
this might be the strongest one the most
powerful one for me will you survive to
the other side of this so if I'm nervous
about going somewhere or doing something
I ask myself well Jessica you're being
so dramatic in your mind are you gonna
survive on the other side of this will
you be able to come home that night and
go to bed and be fine yes the answer is
always yes and so that's another thing
that again puts the event or the moment
in perspective because it's it's
something that it's not gonna kill you
to do in fact it might make you a
stronger person and again those in hers
that anxiety is not helping you get
through it at all
my third tip is to breathe now I know
that's like duh but I've learned a
couple like through little like brain
lesson it's a long story
at my school they're like little brain
lessons they do with the kids so we've
learned some things too as teachers and
one of my favorites is and you can do
this at your desk or wherever is to just
breathe in and just kind of trace your
finger and you can do it down you know
where no one can see it but breathe in
every time you trace your finger up and
breathe out when you trace it down I
noticed it's like awkward to watch me do
it's very calming it gets your mind
focused on something else
for just a little bit of time because
you're focusing on that do it as many
times as you want no one has to see you
doing it but there is something about
that one that kind of stood out to me I
mean there's a million things you can do
you to draw circles on your hand and
breathe I mean there's so many you could
just Google breathing exercises blah
blah blah but that's one that's helped
me a lot it's just kind of finding a
breathing thing and that's one that
works for me to just kind of do to
recenter myself and again it helps to
kind of breathe out some of that some of
those nerves and those feelings of
stress and this is especially helpful
like this is the this is an example I
feel like I'm faced with a lot if I'm
nervous about something and I'm I'm
there whatever it is I'm at the place
and I'm in my car and all I need to do
is get out and go in I'll do one of
these just for a second but what I used
to do is I would sit in the car for a
long like I'd get there early and I'd
sit in there ten minutes just like in
turmoil about like what could go wrong
or what you know and I've realized like
Jessica just breathe for a little bit
not too long and just go because the
second you're in there and you get
started you're usually fine and that's
what I've realized time and time again
just sitting in the car or sitting and
just stewing over it it's not helping
anything and you're just wasting your
time and your energy what think about
how much mental energy are wasting on
those nerves
and speaking of that my tip number four
is stop thinking about it our brains and
I don't remember the exact number of
seconds I feel about it I'm like not
well-researched at all but there have
been studies that say that our brains
when you're upset about something let's
say and I'm gonna make up an amount of
time because I don't know the exact time
but let's say when you're upset about
something your brain can physically
think about that thing for like again
I'm making this time up two minutes okay
but once that time is up it's like gone
and what keeps it in there is you
thinking about it again you're giving it
that little impetus that impulse to your
brain to think about it again
and a good example of this is like
jealousy if I were jealous of something
or someone and I maybe I see something
on Instagram like oh my gosh I wish I
look like that so maybe this tinge of
jealousy hits my brain that impulse
let's say it's lasting two minutes
because I don't remem init's is up and
it could have possibly left my brain if
I see that picture again or I just make
myself think about it again then that
two minutes the clock starts over and so
the more you can just let go and focus
your brain on something else something
more productive or positive the second
it can just leave your brain and that's
something that you know if you're a
jealous person I'm using this example
because I feel like with past like you
know now I'm married and I don't really
get gel I just trust Tyler so much more
than maybe I used to trust people that I
used to be with long ago but I used to
be a very jealous person and that was a
really powerful thing for me to learn
recently that you know you kind of do it
to yourself
to a certain extent where you're
thinking about like oh I wonder if
they're you know thinking about this
other person you know you know if you're
a jealous person like all the crazy
thing is your brain suddenly thinks up
well you start thinking about it and
then maybe you actually like move on
you're doing something else and then you
think about it again every time you let
your mind go back to that it's starting
that clock over and it's staying in your
brain and that feeling that horrible
ugly feeling of jealousy just doesn't
leave until you let it leave and that's
something that anytime my mind wanders
to anything negative not necess
really jealousy but just other those
other negative emotions I remind myself
like Jessica you've gotta focus your
brain on something else so I'll turn on
a podcast or I'll read a book or I'll
start a YouTube video because I know or
like if you're religious like I'll just
say a prayer because it just it almost
like reworks your brain okay yeah let's
refocus it this way and it gets that out
of there at least momentarily until
eventually you've just moved on tip
number five and this is another one
that's really powerful I know to some
people and it was for me everyone goes
through the same kinds of emotions now
you might be a little more nervous than
someone else about an event or whatever
but many many people in the world have
these same feelings before social events
and before asking someone for a raise or
before
I know those examples are so specific
but and I feel like we forget that we're
all human and that many many people have
those feelings so you start to think
like what's wrong with me why am i why
do I get so nervous you can sew down on
yourself for feeling nervous when at the
end of the day you're probably not the
only one and I try to tell my students
that too like when they're nervous like
oh you're gonna be on stage for
something or you're giving a
presentation you know what you're
nervous guess what everyone else in the
classroom is too you're not alone you're
not weird because you feel nervous
you're not wrong because you feel
nervous it is a natural feeling there
are two videos that touch on fear and
nerves Steve Harvey does one that is
amazing I get the goosebumps literally
thinking about both of these I will see
if I can find it and I will link it
below very powerful couple of minutes
Will Smith also talks about one about
fear and nerves and he's talking about
how you know joy and all of that is on
the other side of fear you have to get
through it you're going to work through
the fear you're going to survive to the
other side but you have to get through
it because that's where all that joy and
that bliss and all these other things
that life can bring that's where it is
you just have to get through it whatever
you're nervous about do it because on
the other side you're always happier and
then Steve Harvey talks about it too
just fear and just going for it just you
know whatever it is you're trying and he
inspired me a lot because I moved school
districts and I was so so incredibly
nervous
I was moving to a district that I knew
absolutely no-one and it was a very
different culture completely different
and I was so terrified and it was the
best decision I've ever made
it was truly it has brought me so much
joy I sleep better at night I'm so glad
I did it and again I had to get past
that fear part and just knowing that you
know what Jessica you're gonna be
nervous you're gonna be uncomfortable
you've got to meet a ton of people
you've got to meet families that are
nothing like the families you knew
before and you know it's in a totally
different area of town and then
eventually we move to this area so much
joy came from that terribly scary
decision I made and when I look back on
that I think wow you did that like
Jessica you you did that and anyone that
started a new job and if you have that
kind of same level of stress and nerves
that I typically do you know how hard
that is but it can be so worth it and
again you survive to the other side I
hope that these tips were helpful for
someone I'm sure that some of you
watching this might not have that same
level of nerves and stress and so it
might some of this might sound silly to
you but I know that some of you guys out
there probably watching and thinking
like this is exactly what I needed to
hear because I do have these feelings
and I totally know where you know where
I'm coming from so I hope this was
helpful to some of you guys if you
enjoyed it I hope you subscribe I'm
gonna try to do more of these kinds of
topics like I said leave me your topic
ideas for discussions down below I'd
love to hear your tips your mantras
things you say in your mind things you
ask yourself to help you get through
things like this and other than that I
will see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
