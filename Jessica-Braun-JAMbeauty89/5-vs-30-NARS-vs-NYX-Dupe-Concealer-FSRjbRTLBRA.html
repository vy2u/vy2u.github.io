a is it a dupe video which is basically
me comparing two different products that
one is really expensive one is super
cheap and trying them out on camera
demoing them for you guys and then
talking about you know whether the
cheaper one is just as good as the
high-end one or you know what's the deal
so today I'm comparing the NARS radiant
creamy concealer with the NYX HD
concealer and these both have similar
packaging I have similar shades in both
I have vanilla which is the second to
lightest shade in the NARS one and then
in the NYX HD I have the lightest one
which is porcelain and you'll see in the
swatches here the top one is the NYX HD
one and the bottom one is NARS the NARS
one in vanilla has more of a gray tint
to it and the next one has more of a
yellow tint to it but they both end up
looking kind of the same on my eyes
which is why I'm comparing them but
mostly this video is comparing the
formula of them seeing if they both
cover as well stay on as well
etc so let's go ahead and get into the
demo of me applying it to my eyes today
I wonder if you can tell which one is
NARS and which one is NYX
coz one is NYX and one is NARS but which
one is it so let's go ahead and get into
the demo so you can see how they work
and then afterwards I'll get into the
pros and cons of both and whether or not
I think the next one is a dupe for it
okay so I'm going to use the NYX one on
my right side and the NARS one on my
left so they're both similar packaging
where they've got the doe foot
applicator and I'm just going to take
the next one and just Pat it right there
and I'm just going to blend them with my
fingers because not everyone has brushes
and/or Beauty blenders so I just want to
see how these perform with fingers so
I'm just going to start by pushing it in
to where I've placed it and then I'm
just going to kind of spread it down
kind of in a triangular shape to
brighten and then out with any excess if
it's what's nice about this nyx
concealer is that it is certainly
brightening and you can tell right away
I mean look how much brighter it is but
it also conceals and I do feel like it's
got really good coverage for something
that is in a doe foot applicator
like a lot of concealers like that
aren't as high coverage sometimes not
always but like the wet-and-wild one
that I've reviewed before and I can link
that video below you know it's a little
bit cheaper than the next one by you
know a couple dollars but it's not
nearly as good as this so so you can see
how bright that is right now let's try
the NARS one on the other side this one
I think is a little bit thicker than the
NYX one just a little bit thicker of
like a cream but they're still very
similar um and again I'm going to do
that same thing I will say this NARS one
sinks in a little bit quicker when
you're doing it with your fingers but
again not everyone does this with their
fingers some people use brushes which
makes it quicker you could use a beauty
blender with these absolutely so you can
see that they both have covered I know I
look crazy because I don't have anything
other than Foundation and now concealer
on but you can see that if they both
really do brighten that area and cover
darkness which I've got a lot of I also
kind of tired I'm a teacher and I'm
exhausted always so you can see they're
like little bits of puffiness which I
don't think either one of those
perfectly cover up but um I do think
that it does a pretty darn good job of
brightening it so it's not nearly as
obvious let's start with the price point
of both the NYX one is $4.99 on ulties
website and on Sephora's website the
NARS one is $29 now I will say the NARS
one does have doubled the amount of
concealer the NARS one has 0.2 two
ounces and the next one has 0.11 ounces
so keeping in mind that the NARS has
double it's still way more than double
the price in fact it's six times the
price of the next one so but that is one
thing to keep in mind shade range wise
they both have around ten shades but the
NYX one has eleven but three of them are
like colors so they have like a green
like a mint green one for redness more
yellow yellow and then I think they
might have like a purple one as well so
they do have some more out there
concealer colors for different
discoloration issues whereas the NARS
just has like skintone shades like I've
mentioned the packaging is very very
similar in these they both have that doe
foot applicator I think that formula
wise at first glance the NYX one is a
lot thinner than the NARS when the NARS
truly is a little bit creamier but as
you saw when I blend it with my finger
they both blend it out I think the NARS
one blended into my skin quicker but I
think if you're using a brush or beauty
blender they're both going to blend and
quicker than your fingers would anyway
but I do think that the overall and look
is the same I really I mean I'm looking
in my mirror here I'm looking in the
viewfinder here I really don't feel that
either one is better than the other and
yet you're paying so much more money I
mean six times the amount of money for
the NARS one and the next one I think
performs the same I mean do you guys
notice the difference this is the NYX
this is the NARS I really really don't I
will say about both of these I think
they do a great job of not settling in
fine lines and they make you look I
think a little more youthful under your
eyes adds a little bit more moisture now
if you have really oily under eye lids
that I think this might add a little
more oil to it if you will so you might
not love it but I kind of have dry under
eyes I think I would rather look more
moisturize than not they both wear the
same all day I've done this before in
fact I did this a few times this week
just to see how they would wear and they
both looked exactly the same at the end
of the day neither one of them broke up
or looked weird or cakey or crepey or
anything like that it kept the coverage
the same nothing like started popping
through another added bonus to buying
the next one is not only do you save
money but on alta they'll have NYX buy
one get one half off all the time in
fact they might be buy one get one half
off right now I'll link it below but
I'll also link the NARS one because
sometimes it is nice and I know I felt
this way before you know when I bought
this NARS one I was just kind of in a
mood grows like I just feel like
treating myself so I bought this even
though I knew it was ridiculously
expensive just to a try it out but also
I just wanted something luxurious so it
kind of depends on how you're feeling
but I really do feel like you can save
so much money and get the next one it is
just as good they have about the same
range of colors so you can probably find
something that
work for you they did have a lot of
deeper tones to both of them did which I
thought was nice for the darker-skinned
gals anyone that's got I mean I'm Ferris
could be hopefully this dupe review demo
video is helpful for you guys let me
know what else you're curious about on
whether or not it's a dupe and perhaps I
will try it out here on camera for you
guys if you're interested in more of my
drugstore review videos and other
comparisons I can link some below
including my drugstore review playlists
and I'll catch you guys in my next video
