going to share with you guys a kind of
Duke that I found I wanted to show you
guys what they look like up close with
swatches and talk about the price points
and the differences and whether or not I
really truly believe it is a true dupe
so the product that I have found a dupe
for is the Marc Jacobs insta mark light
filtering contour powder and this is in
the duo Mirage filter now the Duke I
have possibly found is five dollars this
is $49 so there is a huge price
difference so let's go ahead and get
into it
so let's start with the expensive
products so the claims for this is that
it's ultra blendable you're supposed to
of course use the darker shade to
contour the deeper parts of your face
highlight shade is supposed to be a lot
more subtle there's no shimmer in either
one of these shades and so it's just
supposed to be a lot more subtle really
blended really creamy and just supposed
to look kind of natural and flawless so
for $49 it better do this now I have had
this for quite some time
it's huge packaging of course it's
really nice it clicks into place and
then you push this to open it and it's
huge pants so obviously a huge mirror as
well so these the contour shade is
really really creamy and I'll show you
swatches here of this product the
highlight shade just as creamy they're
really finely milled they blend really
beautifully on the skin and they don't
really kick up a lot of powder I use
this on this side of my face today so I
would say it the contour shade is not
super subtle I mean you do once you
blended it out it looks a lot better but
it's not as subtle as say the highlight
shade is now the highlight one I use on
my under eye two kind of since it is
matte I'll use that to set my under eye
powder and I do like the way it looks
but it's not super high coverage by any
means and of course that's not the
claims of this so if you're wanting
coverage with this light almost banana
like powder you're not really going to
get super coverage but you will you know
it does diffuse the light in the area
even if you didn't use it the way I use
it's meant to be used you know in the
high points of your face and maybe down
the bridge of your nose and it lightens
it a little bit but again it's nothing
dramatic so this isn't for drama it's
just for just beautifying your skin
without looking like you're trying and I
do like this product for that but let's
talk about the dupe I've maybe foul so
let's talk about the cheaper version
this is the Wet n Wild mega glow
contouring palette and it is in the duo
called caramel toffee now they also have
a duo called dulce de leche which is a
lot more of cooler tones and it's more
of like a vanilla color for the
highlight the claims on this same thing
it's supposed to be really blendable
supposed to you know you're supposed to
use this for a contour shade this to
highlight they're both matte they're
both about the same size the pans are
both huge on both of these um but I'll
show you some swatches of these the
shades of these are very very velvety
very pigmented when you swatch them but
you can tell right away that it's more
of a bronzer orange shade versus a more
shadowy contour shade and when you
compare the two side-by-side there is a
very big difference so it's just kind of
interesting I think this was kind of wet
wilds play on this I mean it can't it
has to be right I mean too many
similarities but I really think that for
this to be a true contouring palette it
needs to be a little less orange contour
is meant to be a shadow on any skin tone
so typically a more gray tone one is
going to be a much more shadowy effect
versus more of a bronzer shade now this
is going to look beautiful on some skin
tones but even still it's still gonna
look more like a bronzer can look a
little muddy I'm wearing this on this
side of my face and I really had to work
to blend it out and even still it's not
perfect because it is so Orange on me
even the other one which is dulce de
leche I mentioned this one is a little
more of like a contour color so when you
look at it compared to that so this is
caramel toffee this is the dulce de
leche it's a little bit more of a shadow
which I feel like I wish I could pop
these out and take the the contour from
dulce de leche and the banana
are from the caramel toffee and put them
together because I feel like it'd be an
even better dupe for the Marc Jacobs one
so let's go through kind of the pros and
cons I would say blendability they're
both blendable the Marc Jacob ones the
Marc Jacobs one blends a little bit
better but they really do both do a
great job of once you put it where you
want it you really can blend it and make
it look a lot more flawless for both of
them
pigmentation they're both very pigmented
I would almost venture to say that the
lighter highlight shade on the wet wild
one is even more pigmented than the one
from Marc Jacobs one I noticed that when
I first bought this and swatch it I of
course thought of my Marc Jacobs one and
thought oh my gosh though this highlight
shade is way more pigmented than this
the texture of these both of them are
very very silky and velvety smooth but
the white mug one does kick up a little
bit more powder but as long as you you
know if you're using a brush to apply it
I would assume you are if you tap off
the excess then it's not going to make a
difference it's still going to apply
very well you don't need to tap off
excess with the Marc Jacobs one because
it doesn't kick up a lot of powder but
it's just something to keep in mind
there is that difference obviously shade
wise it is a shade difference but the
banana powders are really close so if
you're really wanting it for that I
would say just get the cheaper one
because it's just as good but if you're
wanting a true contour shade with the
banana powder then this really is a
better choice unless you went out and
maybe bought both of the wet and wild
one so you'd spend maybe ten dollars and
have both of them versus forty-nine
dollars for this it's something to think
about neither one of them have a
distinctive smell if that's something
that you'd be concerned about the one
wild one maybe has a slight smell but
it's so I mean I have never ever noticed
it and even smelling like this it's
really not noticeable and this one
doesn't have a smell at all either the
wear time on these I think the Marc
Jacobs one does wear a little bit longer
do they both wear all day honestly no so
I mean the reality is neither one of
these I am a teacher and I work all day
so by the time I'm getting off work
neither one of them are perfectly in
place so I wouldn't say that either one
of these have a 12 to 15 hour where time
because neither one do but this probably
does last a little bit longer than this
and as this one wears off it is a little
bit splotchy in that area whereas this
one it just kind of wears off evenly
which I do like so um is the
splotchiness super bad no but it is I
mean if you're looking for it you'll see
it so that is another thing to keep in
mind obviously the price point is the
biggest difference with this it's a $44
difference $49 versus $4.99 these you
can get it Walmart and I'll link both of
these below of course but this one want
one you can get at Walmart and sometimes
it's even like as low as $3 if you've
got coupons or whatever the Marc Jacobs
one I bought mine from sephora's website
so that's where I'll link it from but of
course you can buy it in tons of
different places obviously there are so
many similarities between these but
there are also some differences are they
true true dupes for each other I would
say no are they pretty good and if you
know that you're looking for a very
specific thing in one like if you're
looking for just a banana powder you can
I would say you could save your money
and get the wet and wild one because the
banana powder and the Marc Jacobs one is
nice but I don't think it's any nicer
than the wet and wild one whereas the
contour shades I do think the market
Marc Jacobs one is more accurately a
contour shade and it is a little bit
nicer of a formula it stays a little bit
longer and it's just a little bit more
seamless and flawless hopefully this
dupe video was helpful for you guys I
will link my dupes video playlist down
below I have done a ton of dupe videos I
know I love learning about dupes and
saving money where I can and maybe
splurging where it's worth splurging so
I will link those below and I hope</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
