going to do a 5-minute get ready with me
it might be longer than 5 minutes
because I'm going to explain what I'm
doing I don't know but this is the look
that I do when I'm in a hurry I'm a
teacher so during the year I'm often in
a hurry and so I'm just slapping stuff
on my face but these are products that I
genuinely grab for quite often to do a
really quick look so let's go again it's
the first thing I do is moisturize I've
already put a serum on my face now if
I'm in a rush that steps sometimes get
skipped but I'm just using the elf daily
hydration moisturizer I like this
because it doesn't take too long to sink
into your face and it's a lot cheaper
like I love my totally one that does the
same thing but this is so much cheaper
and it just feels so good on the face if
you've never tried this daily hydration
moisturizer I highly recommend it so I'm
going to use my dr. dark beauty balm I
love this one I love the one that's in
the gold too the reason I like it it has
it it has a really high SPF almost out
no honestly when I'm in a rush I just
apply it with my fingers so I just kind
of tap it everywhere it really is
thicker than a normal tinted moisturizer
it's almost like rubbing a really good
sunscreen on you pretty well really it
is because there's sunscreen in but I'll
get it if I'm in a hurry and I need
extra coverage I'll put it on my eyelid
I mean everywhere as almost like
concealer step it's got amazing coverage
for a BB cream and that's why so many
people love this stuff like honestly if
I can only do one step in my regiment I
feel like that would be it because I
feel like my skin instantly looks so
much better next step would be concealer
my favorite quick concealer is the
number 7 radiant glow I just put it
right here and again I'm just going to
use my fingers to kind of tap this in
this is the shade number 10 it's nothing
that's going to give you crazy high
coverage but again if you're in a hurry
it's better than nothing but I just like
the way this looks it's just so quick to
blend in which is another reason why I
like to use it when I'm in a rush since
this is still a little bit tacky and I'm
in a rush I like to toss a powder on top
this is one this is a covergirl advanced
radiance powder
I am liking it but I like to use a
fluffy brush with it because I don't
want too much I just kind of tap it in
because this stuff can look kind of
cakey but it really does a great job of
soaking up powder without completely
sucking the life out of your skin a next
step blush this is the elf studio blush
in mellow mom this is great because I'm
not going to put a bronzer on but it's a
nice peachy color that I don't mind kind
of pulling back where I would put not
like everywhere I would put bronzer but
kind of as an all-in-one we're going to
call it draping not true draping but I
feel like this step is kind of important
if you do have that extra 30 seconds
because I feel like it brings a lot of
life into your face if you're not going
to put bronzer and stuff on next step is
highlight now this is an obvious skip
step but I love my NYX go subdue because
all I do is I get a little bit on my
finger and just tap it right there and I
feel like it instantly makes me look
like I try way harder than I actually
did and all it's doing it's not really a
highlight so I guess I can't but it kind
of it more of a glossy dewy effect I'll
even put some on the tip of my nose I
feel like it makes it look so much more
put together brow I'm going to use the
gloss be a boy brow this is something
that you don't have to do for me my brow
I feel like need the help and so I don't
like skipping this step I will say this
with a glossy a boy brow for me my brows
are crazy thick so I do have to tap a
little bit off but I'm just going to
kind of lightly brush it through it's
just going to darken a little bit I
always have to be really careful not to
go too far outside my brow line because
then it just starts looking crazy
because then you've got to clean it all
up and it takes longer than what you
were intending to do you know now what I
realized what this stuff is you can
totally like wait a second and apply
more so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to move on to the next step but
I'm going to go back in and apply
another layer once it dries and I feel
like it darkens it just a little bit but
that didn't take very long did it okay
next step is my Indian War Paint Pot
from Mac this is one of my favorite
go-to
products because I'll just tap it on my
eyelid and let it get a little bit into
the crease and then I'll grab a kind of
crease brush and just kind of blend it
and that's pretty much it I do the same
thing over here and I love this because
you
like ants good hop because when you're
in a hurry and you're trying to do a
fancy look well everything goes awry for
me when I try to do but doesn't that
look like I tried a lot harder and all
it was is one eye shadow like this for
hours looking a lot darker than this one
what are you a snake okay so now on some
mascara
I'm not going to curl my lashes because
when I'm in a rush I don't this is a
cosmetic superhero mascara that I love
and if you wiggle at the base at almost
Auto tight lines for you which is pretty
cool this were a real day
why would today nothing really if this
were for real me in a rush I would have
dry shampooed my hair before I even
started getting ready and then just
pulled it back and let that soak in
while I got ready then I take my hair
down and brush out the dry shampoo so
this is the completed look I feel like
it's you know certainly not me at my
most glamorous but I do feel a lot more
put together it looks like I try if you
