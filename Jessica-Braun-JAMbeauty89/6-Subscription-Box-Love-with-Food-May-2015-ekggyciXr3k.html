brand new well it's new to be so future
box unboxing with love with food and I'm
so excited because you guys know first
of all I go giddy with subscription
boxes I unbox tons of them on my channel
it's just it's a big cornerstone of my
channel I say that in a lot of videos
about a lot of things but it's true
these are $10 a month this is the
tasting box that they sell they also
have a gluten free box it's a lot more
expensive but they do have it and they
have a like deluxe box as well I'm
excited to open this and try a bunch of
these here's what I love about it for
every box that you guys buy from my link
they will donate a meal not a box but a
meal to a food bank in my hometown so I
got to pick the food bank and I picked
Gleaners Food Bank here in Indy apples
Indiana where I live and I think this is
so cool you can get with that same
length the one that will donate a meal
to the food bank for every box purchase
you can also get the box of your first
box for 6 bucks so that's also a win
it's six months for a box of food and I
got so excited because when I was on the
love with food website and kind of
looking more into it I saw that one of
my favorite Travel Channel guys Andrew
Zimmern had like tweeted at one point
about love with food and saying you know
this is a great cause whatever but I
just got excited cuz I love Andrew
Zimmern I love the Travel Channel anyway
so it's such a good cause and I'm so
excited to collaborate with them on this
because first of all I love food I am in
love with food and plus it's a good
cause so it's a win-win for everyone and
I'm so excited so let's go ahead and dig
into this alright so it says here when
you first open us is one box one meal
you helped fight hunger in America you
made a difference we love you and that's
out there social media so it looks like
there's a theme it says Fiesta Fiesta
and oh and then it goes it actually has
all the things so from what I understand
these snacks are usually or this food
whatever is all-natural for each of the
things that actually says like okay this
product is vegan and gluten free and
non-gmo or this is organic you know so
that's kind of nice like for example my
mom is gluten
so you know what I made me a buyer the
gluten-free box for her birthday
birthdays in like December maybe I well
anyway so it's a really cool it could
even be a gift idea what am I even
talking about let's try this food so the
very first thing on top is Dick and Jane
Baking Company smart educational snacks
so it looks like there's little cookies
and it's English and Spanish so one of
them's at school it's great ah I'm
excited to open these I hope they're
like animal cookies so this one is for
Quatro we're just gonna happen a lot
okay
it tastes like animal crackers mixed
with shortbread I love shortbread
cookies so those are awesome awesome the
next thing these are PB Finn's it looks
it's the same brand is like the PB to
the like powdered peanut butter which I
actually use in my smoothies only 100
calories it says C these are gluten free
and vegan so just a little tiny mmm they
taste like peanut butter Captain Crunch
these would be good in cereal forget
calling these crackers this would be
just straight up cereal for me these are
really good mmm they have like a real
peanut butter taste to them though it's
not like that same case it actually
tastes like peanut butter so this next
thing is home free mini lemon burst
cookies not free and whole grain and
gluten free mo all right
oh these are bigger than I thought so
it's like a mm-hmm hmm whoa it almost
tastes like lemon meringue pie like at
the end when you get that like lemon
kick because it's got the taste but then
at the end it's like a burp it is like a
burst it's really good but you have to
like lemon that's for sure but those are
good my oldest brother loves lemon
flavored anything he'd love that
so the next thing move Tyler's gonna
want to try these these are it says the
better chip the flavors inside spinach
and kale and sea salt I've been wanting
to make like kale chips at home I just
never have I've heard it - really easy
but you just never done it okay it looks
like it smells good here's what I
already like about these they're not too
salty if you like so many snacks have so
much salt in them I'm like ah like I
can't I know maybe I'm weird about salt
but I just can't handle that much salt
even pretzels have so much salt on them
but these aren't too salty mmm so it's
not just finishing kale its blended into
like a whole grain corn chip that's why
it's more chip like these aren't good
though here's what I love ingredients
list whole grain corn masa flour
sunflower safflower and or canola oil
spinach kale sea salt that's it no weird
things you can't pronounce
I'm that is awesome these I'm gonna have
to save some for Tyler
it's gonna be good all right next thing
Oh gourmet Inca but not spelled the way
you think corn sea salt and vinegar it's
just a roasted corn is it actually
roasted corn let's see it is it's like
an actual corn kernel what so
it's okay I don't know how to describe
this this is an actual corn kernel but
it's crunchy as could be it's like they
and I can't even call like popcorn
because you think that's what would
happen to it if you like cooked it
because that's what happens then but I
mean oh yeah they're like I don't know
how to describe you I'm not kidding like
it take it has the taste of like a frito
but I'm assuming they're not nearly as
bad as a frito is um and it's just so
good oh it's got to Americana in it too
I can taste that it's good like those
the next thing in here is this vintage
be creamed honey with hibiscus this I
might I don't want to like try this
right now but this I'm going to say
because if it's really high like honey
let me see what it says about it spread
this on toasted drizzle I'm fresh fruit
so I want to like actually try this
separately someone open it and then wait
a few days to use it so I'm excited to
try this so I've been trying to get
better about what kind of honey I'm
buying and I've got allergies right now
so using like finding local honey I just
finally found some too so getting really
into honey and so I'm excited to try
that on toast and the next thing this is
a smooth coconut and pink guava fruit
ice so I'm assuming ups but yeah I'm
supposed to freeze this I love things
like this for the summertime because
when you're really craving something
cold like a milkshake or ice cream it
obviously that's not the healthiest
thing in the world for you also I'm
lactose intolerance so it's not that fun
for me to eat I still eat it but I have
to take stuff anyway this is a way
better option because it's not as bad
for you and it's still refreshing and
cold and got some sweet kick to it but
you don't feel as guilty when you're you
know that maybe the next day you're
gonna be the bathing suit ah I can't
wait till summer anyway so I'm excited
to actually freeze this and then try it
and then the last two little things in
here I'm assuming are candies there's a
blood orange candy by go organics and
then ice mango mint candy so let's try
these this is the blood orange one mmm
it has that orange flavor which I love
and candy hold on while I suck on this
I'll be back that was awesome
okay now the what was this iced mango
mint
seems like such an odd calm though same
color it's minty but you can taste the
mango it's really weird it's subtle I go
as I taste the rainbow mmm
different I definitely like the blood
orange one better but this is still good
it does have both the MIT and the mango
flavor I don't know how they I mean it's
a weird combo but it's really good okay
now that I've got cavities no kidding
that's how I always feel when I eat hard
candies and then I chew them and
evitable II cuz I can't be patient
enough to just let it dissolve I have to
bite it anyway um yeah so that was a lot
of snacks and for 10 bucks or even 6
bucks at least for your first one it's
awesome you guys I love this and I was
so excited to collaborate with them like
I said because this really is for such a
good cause and it's funny because I tell
my students they get breakfast in the
morning can some of them will throw away
their entire like say it'll be like some
sort of pastry or something they'll just
get it and drink the juice like they'll
get the breakfast but then just throw
away the rest and I'm like I'll take it
I'll give it to some like I mean it's
just crazy how a lot of people they just
don't quite get it they don't get that
there are people that are starving this
is such a great way because you know
when you're in your real life it's hard
to just you know you're not gonna travel
across the world and go fight world
hunger unless that's your job or that's
your mission in life but this is a great
easy way to at least help a little bit
so I thought that was really cool like I
mentioned I'll leave the links below for
all of that for the for the six-dollar
first box and also the donating thing I
think it's all in one the same link so
hopefully you enjoyed this video I know
it was different but I love doing
subscription box and boxing's of course
and if you enjoyed it and you want to
check out more of my subscription box
unboxing videos I will link my playlist

I'll catch you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
