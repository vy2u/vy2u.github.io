share with you guys seven things that
you do not need in your makeup
collection it is time to declutter it to
get rid of it I'm obsessed with
decluttering I've been doing it for a
while on my channel I'll link my
declutter playlist before I get into
this keep in mind it's just makeup it's
not that deep I'm not meaning to offend
anyone I'm not you know these are just
my opinions obviously some of these
things work for some people but doing
this video for fun because they think
it's kind of fun to share so let's go
and get into it first thing you need to
get rid of from your makeup collection
is that really deep colored lip gloss
that's like maybe it's like deep red or
it's like bright berry or it's a really
stark color that runs outside your lip
line because it's a lip gloss after all
that you never wear and you always keep
it usual oh that a little good over a
red lipstick but then you never put it
over a red lipstick because if you're
wearing a red lipstick you want it to
stay in place get rid of that lip gloss
you're never going to wear it or you
wear it once and then you'll love
yourself in the mirror and think I don't
really like the way this looks so then
you wipe it off anyway just get rid of
it now the second thing you can deter is
that giant eyeshadow palette you have
with 88 eyeshadows in it when you
already have like 10 other eyeshadow
palettes or maybe two or maybe one and
you never ever reach for that huge one
but you always say to yourself oh but
maybe maybe one day I'll use this bright
yellow color on my eyes when I do a
bright yellow eyeshadow look that day is
never gonna come and if you need it for
a Halloween costume or for that one day
you're gonna do it go buy a wet and wild
trio with that bright color in it for
three dollars and call it a day because
you do not need that huge power unless
you're like a makeup artist or if you
actually use it third thing you need to
is that brown or that really light nude
lipstick that you keep cuz you're like
Kylie Jenner wear this or you keep it
cuz you're like well this youtuber wore
it and it looks so good on her well that
youtuber
maybe a different skin color than you or
just a completely different skin type
whatever and while it might look good on
someone else if you've tried it on and
you know it looks crazy on you and
you're just keeping it because you're
like but if you're never gonna wear it
and get rid of it it looks like I have a
brown lipstick that looks horrendous on
me and I finally got rid of it because
I'm like why am i holding on to this
like it literally looks terrible or I
have like a matte lipstick and it was I
think it was like nymph or something it
was really really light and I'm like but
it's like a cult classic I'm gonna keep
it no you do not have to keep it no one
cares whether you own it or you don't
and if you're never ever gonna wear it
just sitting there going back pass it on
to someone that actually will wear it
next one
that giant powder brush you have that
you keep because you like oh it'll be
great for bronzing up my neck I think
maybe once in my life I have bronzed up
like my decollete and my neck and I'm
pretty sure that was for my wedding like
other than that I just don't do that so
if you know yourself and you know you're
kind of gonna do that and that big
powder brush would take up a lot of room
in your collection get rid of it now if
you do it all the time then keep it use
it but most people don't I mean come on
next thing you need to get rid of the
millions of Beauty Blender dupes that
you have bought at TJ Maxx Marshalls
amazon.com all the different places CVS
Walgreens that you know aren't as good
as the real one but you keep buying them
in hopes now some of them are okay but
if you've got like five different types
and you're not even using any of them
get rid of them they're just soaking up
bacteria they're just getting gross get
rid of the ones you're not using there's
no point in holding on to them
next thing you don't need unless you're
a makeup artist a huge contour palette
you guys use most of us fluctuate our
skin tone a little bit throughout the
year but nothing drastic enough where
you jump from one contour shape to
another completely in a year I mean
maybe some people but that would be rare
you don't need eight different shades of
different contour things for different
highlights in the same palette you can't
really travel with it well it's better
to have one shade that works or maybe
like a smaller palette but those huge
ones we don't need them unless your
makeup are
the last thing you can easily and
quickly get rid of from your collection
are the 50 samples that you have from
Sephora and Nordstrom comm make all the
different department stores you can
order from online Sephora website Ulta
all those samples you get that you know
you're never gonna use get rid of them
you're holding on to anything well when
I run out of mascara then I'll have this
one you know what's not gonna happen
because you know you'll buy another
mascara way before you run out of the
other one or you already have like three
backups it's never gonna happen at least
for me it never happens so I finally
realized I unless it's a sample that I'm
gonna try like within the week it's gone
I just get rid of it because someone
else will use it and be excited to use
it whereas for me it's just sitting
there waiting and eventually I get rid
of it anyway or it eventually just goes
back cuz I waited two years to use it
hopefully this video was enjoyable and
helpful for you guys I will link my
declutter and playlist as I mentioned
down below so you can watch if you're
just in that decluttering mood I've also
done a mine tricks you need to declutter
your life video which I will also link
it's kind of some things you can ask
yourself and think to yourself as you're
trying to declutter just to keep
yourself on the right track so you're
not keeping things for the wrong reasons
you know there's nothing wrong with
keeping things and having a collection
but I think there is something wrong
when you can't control what you're
keeping that you're just keeping these
just to keep them you know so I hope
that you'll subscribe to catch more
decluttering tips and I'll see you guys
in my next video bye and you guys didn't
tell me yet again I'm drinking my tea
and it always pushes my lipstick up like
I've got a little like horns coming out
of my lips and you guys didn't tell me
that was burning outside my little one
