going to be doing a double review demo
kind of face-off between a really
expensive mascara and a really really
cheap one I'm comparing the it cosmetics
tightline mascara with the NYX skinny
mascara now the idea behind these is
that they're meant to be there's their
really skinny wands and I'll show it to
you a really really skinny wand and
you're supposed to kind of do it really
close to the base of your lashes so that
it kind of separates your lashes and
Prime's them for mascara now the it
cosmetics one and you'll see in my demo
I mentioned I use these as primers is
literally called a primer like a mascara
primer whereas this one just is called
the skinny mascara but I use them both
in the same way where I'll use them and
then I'll put a mascara on top of them
so let's get into the demo of me
applying this one to the side and this
one to this one so you can see how they
work and how they compare keep in mind
that this it cosmetics one is $24 and
the next one is $6.99 so there's a huge
price difference and I really think
you'll be excited to see what I saw so
the it cosmetics one is they both are
the exact same the wand is almost barely
there because that's the idea that it's
got these tiny grooves that get right
between your lashes and what I like
about these is that they separate your
lashes really really well and I kind of
view these more as like a primer because
I never typically wear these alone but
they do a great job of just separating
them getting them black and the idea is
that of course I've got liner on my eyes
right now but the idea is that it really
darkens that tight line area so that you
don't necessarily have to tight line it
just gives you a darker but like I said
I've already lined my eyes so I use this
more as a primer but I really like it
because then I don't have to do the
steps of combing through my lashes and
all that stuff it kind of does it for
you so this is the cosmetics side now
the next one it's the exact same
packaging the same type
a wand and let's do it the same way just
starting deeply at the base and wiggling
up honestly you guys hold on it's
flaking just a little bit
I like the next one better it's not only
is it cheaper but it it seems to have
more product on it the it cosmetics one
I really love and I do and I see and buy
it because I've loved it for a few
months now but I brought it with me on
my honeymoon and I liked that it was
waterproof but it just never felt like
there was enough product on the wand
whereas the NYX one actually feels like
an actual mascara that I could go out
and like leave with um
now of course I'm gonna put other
mascara on top of it because that's just
what I always do because like I said I
use this as a primer but I just I mean
do you guys notice the difference I know
what my face looks oily and crazy right
now but do you notice the difference
between the two these look already
longer and more separated in my opinion
so clearly they're the same product you
guys in fact I think that the NYX one is
way better and it's so much cheaper I
think that the next one readily comes
like ready to go where it actually has
some mascara in it I just felt like the
it cosmetics one it has stuff in it but
it never was like as much as I had hoped
like I would put it on I'm like I just
want it to be a little bit blacker
or just a little bit more whereas the
NYX one literally the day I opened it it
was amazing and I couldn't believe it
so I will tell you right now with
confidence that when I run out I'm going
to repurchase the next one not the it
cosmetics one because it's just so much
better and it the price wouldn't even
matter it's so much better like I've
mentioned the packaging is virtually the
same the wand is exactly the same they
don't neither one of them have like a
noticeable smell I don't know if the NYX
one has a waterproof version because the
one thing I did like about the it
cosmetics one is that it's waterproof so
like on my wedding day I used it because
I knew that if I were crying which of
course I was I it wouldn't you know have
those classic black lines running down
your face so I want to look and see if
the if NYX has a waterproof version
however I love this regular formula so a
lot of times when they
make it waterproof the formula changes
it's never as good so maybe that's the
main difference regardless the next
one's awesome this stuff lasts all day
like I said I would wear the NYX one
alone as a mascara I just like to top
stuff on top of it today what I used on
top of both of them is the Jordana best
lash extreme this is like three
ninety-nine at Walgreens and it's one of
my favorite mascaras because it's just a
really thick one it gives you exactly
the volume you want I will say this is
one of those mascaras that the first two
weeks of using it it's not as good as it
will be it just needs to dry out just a
little bit and then it's perfect but I
love this stuff so where to buy these
these are both available on Ulta for
sure I actually bought my NYX one at
Target like in store they have it so if
you're not wanting to buy it online look
at your local Target because they a lot
of them now have NYX there and they had
the skinny mascara there because medics
one was actually sent to me a long time
ago but they sell it on Ulta they sell
both of these but again I still
recommend the next one so hopefully this
video was helpful for you guys let me
