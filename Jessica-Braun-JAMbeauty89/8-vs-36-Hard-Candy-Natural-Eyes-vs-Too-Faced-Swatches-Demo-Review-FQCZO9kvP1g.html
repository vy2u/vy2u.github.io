everyone is Jessica and Tamron you a
review and comparison and demo of a very
expensive palette and a very very cheap
palette and I swear they are virtually
dupes for each other now the expensive
one is the Too Faced natural eyes
palette this palette retails for $36 so
it is expensive and it's got nine
different shades it has four matte
shades and five shimmery shades and I
have been using this like crazy it's one
of my all-time favorite palettes now I
recently went to Walmart and bought I
had hauled it was a huge drugstore haul
I can link it below if you want to watch
it but I hold a bunch of hard candy
products and I found this hard candy
natural eyes palette and when I saw it I
thought oh that's just a really pretty
palette so I bought it was eight dollars
at Walmart I was like duh they never I
swear drugstore palettes are so hard to
find and especially one with this many
colors that are so pretty and for eight
dollars so and it came with a little
primer in a liner as well which I
haven't even tried yet but I just bought
it because I liked the colors and then I
quickly realized wait a second this and
I actually realized it in the video
where I hold these that oh my gosh these
are almost perfect dupes for each other
and when you look at them this way you
can see it so I'm going to show you some
up-close pictures of both of these
palettes and a swatch of each I'll tell
you right away that while most of these
shadows are dupes for each other there
are a couple that aren't and that I mean
they're both pretty in their own way but
they're not dupes for each other but
these are certainly I mean very
comparable so let's go ahead and get
into the swatches and then I'm going to
show you I actually have used both of
these palettes I used one on this eye
and one on the other I'm not going to
tell you yet which one is which I had
Tyler and my mom separately today guess
which one they thought and my mom
guessed wrong she thought the more
inexpensive one was the expensive one
and vice versa and so it's just been
really really cool to try out so first
time I've ever done this so let's go
ahead and get into the swatches and then
we'll get into the demo of me applying
them to my eyes so you can see how they
work and how they compare so this is the
hard candy palette this is the two-faced
one we're just going to go shadow by
shadowing
compare them you can probably see right
off the bat that these two are not quite
dupes for each other
those were the first ones that when I
saw them I'm like not quite but the rest
of them are pretty close so let's go
ahead and go through so here is the
first swatch which is of that top left
cream shadow the right one of course is
the to face and the left will always be
hard candy
those are pretty close they're both
matte I think the two-faced one is a
little bit more white but they're so
close this one which is the second one
down on the left is these are pretty
different and these I'm using on my lid
here in a second this is the two-faced
one and that is the hard candy and the
two-faced one is a lot more pigmented
and a lot more buttery and this is
actually two swatches of the hard candy
one they're both so pretty in their own
way but this one is a little bit lighter
and a lot more pigmented so here is the
two-faced one in nudi they're on the
bottom left there and this is the hard
candy one I actually think I like the
hard candy one of this better and you'll
see in my demo here in a second that
when I put these on in my crease this
one is a lot less red and this one is
more orange and I liked the hard candy
one better and that is honest I think it
even swatches better
so this one is cashmere bunny in the top
middle there here's to face and there's
hard candy the hard candy one is a
little bit deeper and darker and frankly
more pigmented even so this is the most
impressive to me this is the very middle
color of both palettes this is push it
by Too Faced and this is the hard candy
one and the colors are virtually exactly
the same but the hard candy one is
better it is so absolutely stunning so
this is the bottom middle one this is
honey pop by Too Faced and this is the
other bottom middle one from hard candy
these are completely different now
they're both shimmery pretty Gold's but
I do like the Too Faced one better it's
a more wearable gold to me so this is
the top right corner color this is the
Too Faced and this is the hard candy the
two faces may be a little deeper but
these are so so similar both
pigmentation and color wise so this is
the middle one on the right which from
Too Faced is called erotica I don't
really like this shadow anyway I use it
from time to time but you can see even
the two-faced one is kind of powdery I
think the hard candy
is not as powdery and it's a little more
cooler toned which I think I would
prefer but I don't really use this color
anyway so they're not quite dupes for
each other but I think the hard candy
one is better anyway the last one is the
bottom right which is called chocolate
martini from Too Faced and this is the
hard candy version
I think the two-faced one and this one
is just a little bit deeper a little
more rich color but they both have a
gold glitter in it and so again I don't
use this all that often this is probably
my least used color in the palette but I
mean they're pretty close but they're
not quite exactly the same so what
you're seeing here is the swatch of all
of them together and the bottom one here
is the Too Faced and the top one of
course is the hard candy and one thing
that's obvious right off the bat is that
the two-faced ones they are a little bit
more shimmery the ones that are shimmery
just have a little bit more punch to
them but the matte ones I think are so
comparable and frankly the overall look
which you'll see in a second really is
virtually the same in the tutorial
you're about to see I used all three of
these colors here and then I also used
the middle color in both and then I used
the top right dark brown color so if
you're interested to see those stay
tuned okay so on this I'm going to use
the Too Faced palette and on this side
I'm going to use the hard candy palette
now you've already seen the swatches and
you see how some colors aren't perfect
dupes for each other not at all so I'm
not going to use those because obviously
those would be different looks because
two or three of the shadows just aren't
dupes but the rest of them the ones that
I think are the closest are the ones
that I'm going to use and show you now
really what I'm going to show you is a
look that I do all the time with my Too
Faced palette I'm just recreating it my
normal look on the site and hard cane
and this eye I'm so excited to see if
they end up looking the same so I'm
going to start with the shade heaven
from the Too Faced one which is the same
shade right over here in the hard candy
so I usually apply this with my fingers
so I'm going to do the same now I'm not
using a primer on my eyes because I just
want to see how these shadows do just
straight up on their own that way people
that don't use primer don't have primer
it wouldn't matter so to face one
right off the bat I almost feel as
though the hard candy one was a more
even application than the two-faced one
was so that's kind of interesting so the
next thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to take silk teddy which is this color
right here and the same one over in the
hard candy and I'm just going to use a
fluffy brush to buff that all over my
crease
when I'm noticing right away is that the
hard candy one is not as orange and I'm
going to be honest I like that one more
so I'm going to kind of just to make
sure that they kind of match I kind of
like the hard candy shade better now I'm
going to go through and use push up here
and again the matching one is the one
right in the center of the palate for
the hard candy one as well I'm going to
use push up and just kind of put it
right in the crease
so just looking at it it's still pretty
much looking the same again I feel like
this I is a little more like almost
orange so to deepen up this look just a
little bit more I'm going to use the six
press oh there and again it's the same
matching one over here and it's just a
matte deep kind of chocolate brown and
I'm just using a smaller fluffy brush is
actually an elf one there elf crease
brush and sorry this is Too Faced and
again work it just in the outer corner
of my crease and a little bit on the lid
as well
so now what I typically do is I
typically will take a little bit more of
the silk the silk teddy which is that
one we started with and I put a little
bit more on the inner part of my lid
just to kind of jazz that part up so I'm
going to do the same with the hard candy
and then I'm going to take a different
fluffy brush and with that matte crease
 or the matte cream shade I'm going
to take just a little bit tap some off
and I usually this is for my brow bone
but I use whatever's left to kind of
meld everything else together
now the last thing I typically do before
I do like my eyeliner and mascara and
everything else I don't even have blush
on yet is I'll take this again that deep
brown chocolate color and just with a
small angled brush i line my lower lash
line with it just kind of on the outer
portion you can kind of smudge it do
whatever you want to do with it
because I don't typically use like a
that's not true I just don't always use
a pencil liner I like it a little bit
softer so I'm gonna do the same thing
with the hard-candy one
so if you look at it I know I'm not
complete or done or anything but it
really does look the same I mean once
it's all blended together there's no way
anyone could ever tell that these are
two completely different brands it's
kind of amazing so I'm going to go ahead
and finish my makeup and then we'll talk
some more now let's run down the pros
and cons of both price-wise the Too
Faced one is $36 the hard candy one is
eight and the hard candy one has bonuses
of the primer and the liner now they
also have sassy eyes and they also have
a smoky eyes palette so if you know that
Browns and neutrals aren't for you and
you like smoky colors go for that
playful one so you go for the sassy one
so they do have other options if you
like that
now packaging wise these are both that
kind of tin this one is smaller because
it just has the shadows but they both
have a mirror they both are magnetically
closed so I think packaging wise they're
definitely similar the texture both of
these shadows are I would say they're so
close I think that some of the hard
candy ones are a little more powdery
while the two-faced ones aren't but then
I think some of the two-faced ones are
almost too shimmery while the hard candy
ones aren't so there's kind of it just
depends shadow by shadow and when you
look through the swatches you could see
you know the differences between some of
them but they're both all 9 shadows of
both are really really nice
I think these both apply beautifully
with both your fingers and a brush I
don't think it really matters and I you
know they're both just so nice they're
both so pigmented and you saw when I
applied these that they really do both
blend really well together I do think
the two-faced ones are a little shimmery
err so when you look at when this all
blended together that shimmer spread
throughout the look whereas the shimmer
didn't spread throughout this look which
I kind of like that better I think you
know I didn't use a primer for this look
you guys saw I typically do use a primer
I'll use my wet Wild Fergie one that I
love or my Too Faced shadow insurance
they're both fantastic and even without
a primer this is lasted for a very long
time neither one of them has faded they
both look just the same
so I do feel like we're time
both are the same they last just all day
even without a primer I will say I felt
that the hard candy ones almost applied
more evenly than the two faced once did
and that surprised me because I figured
oh for sure the two faced one is going
to blend better and it's going to go on
smoother but right off the bat when I
applied that lit shadow I saw that the
hard candy one was just smoother there
the hard candy palate is not available
yet online at least at the time that I'm
filming this when it is I'll put the
link up for it because hard candy is
sold on Walmart's website but not all of
their new products are there yet to face
of course I think I bought mine from
Sephora overall would I recommend this
as a dupe for this absolutely obviously
like I've mentioned a million times in
this video they're not exact dupes
they're just not but they are so similar
and if you know that you've been eyeing
this because you know these are all
shadows you would use everyday I would
say save the $28 and just get this one
you're getting virtually the same shades
and they're all so wearable and they
blend so nicely and you get a bonus
primer and liner in a mirror and little
instructions on how to apply certain
looks I think it's an amazing product
for eight dollars I can't believe this
isn't all over YouTube yeah I hope this
review is helpful for you guys let me
know if you like these kind of
comparison demo videos where I compare
two different things that are supposedly
dupes for each other I got a lot of fun
doing this and I hope you had fun
watching it and maybe it was informative
in some way and hopefully I will be
saving you some money if you're
interested in more of my review and demo
videos of drugstore products that I love
I'll put the playlist link below and if
you would please subscribe and I'll
catch you guys in my next one bye
