gonna share with you a pregnancy update
I still can't believe I'm pregnant and
so I am at 24 weeks now I mean maybe
within a day or two when I'm filming
this depending on when I put it up I
might be a little further along you know
cuz time moves forward not backwards so
24 weeks and that's you know right in
the heat of the second trimester and
they always call this trimester the
honeymoon phase because it really is you
know I'm feeling good I've got a lot of
energy I'm you know not to a key I'm not
sick I'm not you know I do get a little
achy but we'll talk about that but I
figured I'd show you hi have pajama
pants on guys under this shirt it is
pajamas yes I've got a full face and
lashes and earrings and a shirt and
pajamas but if you wanted to see it is a
little girl which I've announced I
announced in my live QA a few weeks ago
or whenever you're watching this and I
announce it on Instagram as well but
yeah there she is so I'm measuring it
like a pretty normal size my doctor Pugh
said I okay so here's my story because I
haven't done like official pregnancy
video so this is my first one um I
gained weight quickly at the beginning
and I got so scared cuz I thought like
I'm really not eating much more because
I know like in the first year but you
really don't need to eat any more it's
really until later the it's only like a
couple hundred calories more towards the
end so I really wasn't eating a lot more
of course I was like hungry and wanted
to but I was trying to limit myself but
when I first okay let's start at the
beginning how do we find out we were
pregnant well you know classic symptoms
were there and I'm like hmm
a little later in the month and I'm like
I feel like maybe and so he bought a
pregnancy test and sure enough and he
was kind of with me and all this like
you know I told him like I wonder if I
am and you know all that stuff and so I
went and bought a pregnancy test and I
was telling this story in the live Q&amp;amp;A
but only I went I was alone I went to
Walgreens and the guy
that was all I was buying as a pregnancy
test and I'm looking at all of them and
I'm so overwhelmed because I've never
literally never bought a pregnancy test
before so I'm looking at all these and
I'm like oh you know it's like what do
you fear like $25 ones there's like $8
like did they all work like I don't know
and I'd remember to the back of my head
my sister who's had like five kids was
like I'm telling you you could buy them
at the Dollar Tree they all work you
know you could buy a couple and try them
you'll you'll know and sawing all right
so I found one that was kind of middle
of the range and I walk up to the
checkout and the guy there is like he
you know sees what it is and heat scans
it and I'm thinking oh so awkward like I
don't know why but it was so awkward and
all he said was I hope that the results
or are in your favor and I thought those
hilarious because you know there's a
chance she could be pregnant and you
don't want to be or you could be
pregnant and you do want to be or you're
not pregnant and you wanted to be or you
know and he's like there's so many
possibilities for what people would want
to see on a pregnancy test and why so it
was just funny that's all so that's the
whole story so I took it home and we you
know kind of waited a few minutes and
then looked at the same time and it was
very exciting and of course thing is we
it's scary I mean we didn't really plan
for this and not that there's anything
you know we've been married a couple
years and we knew probably eventually
beat up kids we just didn't know when
and so I think it just happened at the
right time that it was meant to happen
regardless of you know if we felt ready
or not I don't know that we would ever
feel ready and I think that's kind of
for me what put me at ease is you know
what Jessica if you're not ready now
when we'd be right you know you've got a
home you have a job you know we're
pretty steady in this and I thought I
mean I'm gonna feel as ready now as I
would in three years so anyway so it
happened when it happened and I think it
was meant to be and you know I I am a
runner I like to run and so does Tyler
and so you know I made an appointment
the doctor and they said no if you're a
runner you should keep running you know
if you had never run before you
shouldn't start running and so I'm like
perfect so I continue to run not like
hard I would really I mean my max was
two miles
and back you know when I was really
running a lot I would usually run like
three to four miles so I was running
between 1 and 2 miles a couple times a
week and I'm like that's good it's kind
of keeping me healthy and my doctor
absolutely agreed that yes that's that's
gonna be healthy for you and for the
baby since you are used to that so about
I don't know at what weeks it was you
know everything was okay I had no
morning sickness which I I knew most
people my family didn't have terrible
morning sickness
some did but like my sister again she
really never had me with any of her kids
so I thought maybe I won't I really
didn't end up having any morning
sickness and I'm so thankful for that so
you know all was going well and at I
don't know how many weeks maybe maybe
around 11 or 12 weeks I was getting
ready for work and all of a sudden I
felt something and I was like this is
weird
so I rushed in the bathroom and was
definitely bleeding profusely and it was
so so scared I'm trying to like tell us
without getting emotional
because I mean it was so emotional and
of anyway and it was just clots and I'm
thinking for sure like this is it like
this is the end and so I'm screaming for
Tyler and he's you know running in there
and it was so scary and you don't
realize I guess like I didn't realize
how badly I had wanted this sweet little
baby until that moment happened and it
really like shook me to my core cuz I
thought man like I didn't even know that
I was ready and Here I am thinking I'm
losing this baby and I can't think of
anything worse in the world you know and
so it was just a totally terrifying
moment and so he was awesome Tyler was
awesome and he's running up there and so
he's calling the doctor and I'm like
calling my sweet coworker at school
saying like dude I know this sucks but I
can't come in today like there's no way
and she's awesome I just love her and
she was like don't worry about it we'll
take care of it so she took care of
things on the school end with you know
talking to my boss and figuring out sub
plants and stuff and that would
cuz that's all I'm thinking I'm like oh
my gosh like this gonna be a nightmare
at school like how are they gonna do
this I've no sub plans for the day other
than like emergency ones and those are
never very good anyway so I had that one
less worried boy I'm really getting into
these details why am I telling you all
this slow down just so or speed up so we
get to the doctor and the first thing
they say okay you know let's do an
ultrasound let's make sure let's listen
for the heartbeat we never had an
ultrasound at this point was so early on
and so they did an ultrasound and the
heartbeat was there and you could see
the little baby just moving all around
in there and it supposed Tyler and I
were you know in tears and you know he
was not as emotional as baby who's
definitely emotional and we were so
thankful and so we learned and they
could see in the ultrasound that what I
had was a sub chorionic hematoma or a
hemorrhage and I'm still trying to
figure out exactly because I've looked
on so many websites and even them
explaining to me it's basically where
I'm part of your placenta is like
detached from from like or it's like
where the original implantation site was
it like detached so it's usually not a
huge deal it's possible to lead to
complications or even loss of the baby
but it really doesn't always and it's as
I looked more and more into it I
realized you know a lot of people have
this it's a little bit more common I
just never heard of it no one in my
family had it you know I had a few weeks
of bleeding on and off and one point
again it was so scary and bad that I
thought for sure you know something bad
was happening again the whole emotional
so we went in that he did another
ultrasound it's a note the baby's just
fine but they did see on the ultrasound
that the hemorrhage had gotten smaller
and so basically what I had learned that
was with this sub chorionic hematoma
either your baby gets big enough and it
basically just kind of dissolves the
rest of it into your body so it's not
even it basically doesn't even matter or
you pass a lot of it and it's going to
come out as clots and that's scary you
know and so a lot of my did come out as
clots and that's why I thought oh my
gosh it's happening again like but
actually it was in the weirdest way
healing so that was great news again but
it was still an emotional rollercoaster
and so anyway I had I was on bed rest
for a while I had to take I took one
week off and then I went back and then I
had the second scare so I had to take
more time off for bed rest and it was
just crazy so in the end I was put on
progesterone shots I've laughing because
all of us happened and such a short
amount of time and I'm thinking oh my
gosh like it's just crazy but now being
kind of farther along on the other side
of it it's like I can look back and not
laugh at the situation because it was
not funny but you know breathe a sigh of
relief so I was put they checked my
progesterone levels learned that I was
extremely low in that pregnancy hormone
and so they put me on shots that Tyler
would they taught him how to do it and
he had to give him to me he still does
twice a week for pretty much the entire
pregnancy unless somehow my levels are
like through the roof which kids maybe
we would lower it but it basically we
started doing it and it was so hard and
if you've ever had progesterone shots
whether it's for like fertility
treatments or because your levels are
low even in pregnancy it's it's just a
painful shot it's in your rear end
really kind of you know like the hip
area and it's just a thick liquid and it
you know you gotta warm it up and it
just you know it tends to kind of ball
up for a couple days and it can hurt it
can each so he does a good job of kind
of massaging that area for a while and
then I'll get a warm bath to help with
it things like that that you can do
sleep out of heating pad for a little
while but you know it's it's not
comfortable and it still isn't here I am
months of doing this and it's still not
comfortable we've gotten a little better
at it we've got a little more use to it
but it sucks for him it sucks for me but
it's worth it for this little dingdong
in here that's cooking so other than
that like the other things I've noticed
and I've heard progesterone can do this
that your you just can gain weight
quicker and so I don't feel like I've
gained I well I know I have a gay
an abnormally large amount of weight I'm
at a healthy weight for my height and
what I started at so I'm doing fine
there but I am trying to be really
careful about really really eating the
right foods cuz I know that if I were to
eat say my favorite McDonald's if I were
to eat that every single week well
that's going to show big time so and
it's of course just not healthy for me
or her
so I've been trying to be super aware
but I remember really early on like
there were times where I felt like I'd
be 12 or 13 weeks and I'd look and be
like how do I look like I'm like 23
weeks pregnant right now I'm only like
12 weeks but then the next day it
wouldn't be so it was I was just like
bloating and then not and it was just a
wild adventure um and so I would be so
self-conscious like I feel like I look
too big so I wear really loose shirt
plus I hadn't told everyone at work yet
and like the kids didn't know for a
while at work at school so anyway now of
course I'm showing and everyone knows so
it's not that big a deal but um so that
I feel like I'm so sorry this is all
over the place
my biggest solace with this whole thing
about the hormone shots and with this
whole thing with the sub Coriana
hematoma it really helped me find solace
when I would search online for this
stuff because I would see YouTube videos
of people talking about it and it would
make me feel so much better that I
wasn't the only one in the world going
through this and that what I was going
through was somewhat normal not having
that as normal but that you know once I
have it these symptoms I was having
what's normal and that made me feel good
because without it I'm just like I feel
like I'm you know what am I doing wrong
like should I not have been running in
the beginning but I'm like well no my
doctor said I should and so you just
starts doubting everything you're doing
and everything you're eating and you
know all of that when in reality I don't
know that this is preventable I don't
really know I mean there are many things
that can cause a sub crowning hematoma
and I all have no way of knowing so when
I had that of course I was when I was on
bed rest etcetera I was just until this
was completely gone I was not allowed to
exercise period so and that was another
thing I'm Michael I'm gonna gain weight
even faster but again
just really paid attention to what I was
eating now I can work out again but I'm
really not like running I'm kind of just
like you know I'll speed walk on a
treadmill cuz it's the dead of winter
right now I'll speed walk on a treadmill
I'll do some you know light weight
lifting kind of pregnancy workouts that
I'll find online I'll do those kinds of
things but not too much cuz I'm you know
it was just such a scare and I'm like if
I had done that because I've been
running or because you know whatever it
might have been and I'm like wasn't
worth it
anyway so other than that just thinking
about where I am now now fast forwarding
now I filled you in on the history fast
forwarded 24 weeks like I said I'm
feeling pretty good I do have little
bits of backaches here and there I have
gotten a lot more comfortable sleeping
on my side especially my left side I
also sleep on my right side I know
you're not you know you really are
supposed to sleep but if I can't fall
asleep with my dude I need sleep more
than anything and people for thousands
of years have slept on their back and
sides did not had no idea about any of
the stuff we know now and everyone has
been fine but so but I do try to sleep
on my left as much as possible I love
sticking a bunch of blankets or pillows
between my legs on my side cuz it just
feels good on my lower back I know a lot
of people get those that giant like
Snoodle is that what it's called I don't
know the giant pillow you can buy
they're like I don't want to spend the
money and have to store that if I know
like right now I'm doing okay now as I
get bigger maybe I'll change my mind but
I mean those are so ginormous and I'm
like I didn't know where we'd store it
and I don't want to spend the money on
it when I know I'll be done with it I
don't know clothing wise I'm definitely
a maternity clothes now but I've really
gotten into I bought a couple of cute
kimonos because I can wear you know a
form-fitting tank top or like even a
short sleeve like v-neck with a kimono
on top and leggings and it looks it's
cute it's fashionable but it's still
really comfortable and then afterwards I
can still wear the kimono after you know
what I mean it it looks normal with any
shirt not pregnant too but I do have a
tip a couple of tips first place I
bought a lot of maternity clothes for
cheep-cheep is Macy's so I went to
Macy's and walked into there
terney section and they had you know
clearance rack and it was 50% off the
already reduced price that they had
written on there so if it was a
Motherhood Maternity shirt or Jessica
Simpson maternity shirt and it was
originally $40.00 well they had already
marked it down to like 20 and then it
was half off of that so I got a lot of
really cute shirts for 10 bucks some
like really simple cotton v-necks my
favorite that are like fitted but meant
for pregnancy I got a bunch of those for
like five or six bucks on my Camaro so I
ended up buying like $190 worth of stuff
but I bought basically everything I
owned and so assuming God willing that
we have more than one kid I'm gonna be
set for a while when it comes to
maternity clothing and again some of
that I could even wear not pregnant but
you know to kind of find that balance
because you do need some for when your
belt it gets really big um but I also
used HauteLook which is a site I always
look over at my computer that's always
where I'm shopping
they don't always have maternity on
there but a lot of times they do and
it's a flash sale site and everything's
50% off so they get all of their stuff
from department stores HauteLook is
owned by Nordstrom so typically it's
Nordstrom brands which are like really
expensive so I've gotten a lot of
different maternity just tops and
dresses and even pajamas and nursing
tops just preparing for that on there
for way cheaper like 50 to 70 percent
off of the normal price I even got a
maternity coat because we have to go to
outdoor recess when it's 30 degrees you
know it's cold so it's a really thick
maternity black you know puffy coat and
it works great because I'm like I have
to invest in something because I have to
have a coat that fits coz it's so cold
out there and we have to go out anyway
so that was nice and I was able to find
a good deal on that too so I will put
whole looks like below if you're curious
because it is amazing
no not sponsored anything like that I
just genuinely shop they're craving wise
I've really craved runny eggs which a
lot of people say you shouldn't have
runny eggs and I'm like of course I
never craved runny eggs before I was
pregnant and now that's all I was
running eggs but I have learned that
they're pasteurized or if they've like
that I think it's the Red Lion stamp on
it you can and I don't know I just love
eggs in general but one thing one thing
I loved before I was pregnant was boiled
eggs and now the side of boiled eggs
makes me sick so I don't know what's
going on there I just want runny eggs
I've craved sour patch kids a lot orange
juice I really didn't like when she I
literally had a big glass before I was
filming um I'm just craving it a lot and
I don't know if that's my body telling
me I need more maybe vitamin C or if I'm
just craving it but I eat a lot of
fruits a lot of fruits with vitamin C in
it specifically so just kind of
interesting but maybe I need even more
and of course my prenatal vitamins have
that in it too but better to get it from
your food than just the vitamin um one
of the things that I crave chocolate
milk I meet we were at the store
yesterday and I made him it was a local
place near s called traders Point
Creamery I mean it's not that closest
but it's a local like farm if you will
and they had chocolate milk from there
and it was so expensive you guys it was
like $5.99 for like a not a very big
bottle and I saw it and I was like Tyler
I need this chocolate milk he's like
well can't we just get any right like no
this one why I'm tearing at it so we
bought it I haven't tried it I'll maybe
I'll have some with lunch or dinner but
the way we bought it other than that
like McDonald's is a guilty pleasure of
mine so like once a month
we'll get McDonald's and it's like the
best night of my entire life if you
watched my live feed by the way I was
mentioning how I was like thinking about
doing my McDonald's night that night and
having McDonald's but Tyler ended up
making a healthy meal so we ended up
eating that but I'm still I've still yet
to have my McDonald's this month I'm
gonna save it for a really rainy day um
let's see
skin wise like changes I've had I do I'm
getting a lot of hormonal breakouts
especially right here not as many on my
chin or my nose but like here and like
previously before I was pregnant I would
get hormonal breakouts like here and on
my nose see that especially on my chin
but yeah it's always kind of in this
region
but they'll go away quickly they're not
super-dee-duper painful it's not that
big of a deal but that's just something
I've noticed and I also have heard of
like melasma the mask of pregnancy like
little red splotchy
and I definitely get that here like it's
always on this side and it's just here
so I'll just dab a little extra
concealer over it and it's gone there
are lots of different and I'm still
investigating into skincare like only
you should avoid this and you should
avoid this and the list is this long for
things that you should avoid skin care
wise so I'm just kind of just using more
gentle stuff more natural stuff as I'm
kind of trying out products all maybe
like look into like okay let me just
lift this one up because trying to go
through that list and then go through
everything out it's it's overwhelming
I really have straight away from
foundation more and I've just been using
BB cream just because my skin I feel
like it just can't handle it it's just
dry like I've got dry patches here
I don't know so little things like that
I've just switched up because my skin
just looks better with a BB cream on it
right now than it did with like a
foundation that's a little bit trying
but beyond that like my hair I feel like
doesn't get as oily as quickly which i
think is really interesting really
interesting cuz it definitely used to
and I'm trying to think like did I just
switch out products and that's why it's
not looking at so ailing but I really
don't think that's it I think it's just
a little bit drier which in the weirdest
way I'm kind of enjoying because I don't
feel like I have to use as much dry
shampoo or whatever I did switch body
washes to in a V no one I'd been using
one that had a fragrance in it and it
just I felt like it was breaking like
especially at the injection sites for
the hormones it was it's already itchy
and Sam is bad anymore but for a while I
had a rash and we again we went into the
doctor and she's like you know we might
it might be the carrier oil blah blah
blah and so I switched up the the body
wash I was using and I swear to you it
cleared up just like that and I switch
to just in a V no body wash and I love
Aveeno products but their body washes
are my favorite and I hadn't used it in
a while so just like a fragrance free
sensitive skin Aveeno one it's got like
the oatmeal in it and it's just good so
that really helped and I used a little
bit of like the Dove body wash but I
just feel like even though Duff says
it's not drying I sometimes feel like
dove body washes drying on my skin I
don't know why and again I could be in
my head I am trying different oils if
you have any recommendations for oils
for your like tummy some that I've tried
I've used the Palmers ones I've used
like Palmer's the like stretch marks
specific creams and all of those you
know cocoa butter I've used a lot of
different things I'm not really sticking
to any one thing I'm just putting I
figure as long as I'm super moisturizing
if I'm gonna get stretch marks I'm gonna
get stretch marks I have it yet but I'm
kind of mentally preparing for it and if
I do then okay that just means that's
what I've got and lots of women in the
world have them it's not that big of a
deal
and like I just feel like it's kind of a
beautiful thing in its own way because
you have those for a reason you have
them because you are freaking growing a
human in your tummy and then you had to
give birth to that human and it's crazy
what we go through it's crazy
my mind is still reeling over and I'm so
terrified for actual labor and delivery
but yeah so I'm just trying to kind of
keep up with that and now that I'm
further along I'm definitely using more
oil and cream I'm trying one that's like
a raw shea butter one from I think it's
shea moisture and it's like called mommy
cream something with mommy in the title
and it's odd because you have to like
warm in your hands because otherwise
it's a solid but it's really
moisturizing I'm really enjoying that I
just hate that it's it's like kind of
granulated because it's waiting to melt
and that's kind of weird I don't love it
but I do really like the after effect so
any recommendations you guys have for
awesome pregnancy products I want to
know so skincare body care things that
you were like oh my gosh don't forget
this in your baby bag your hospital bag
things like that I want to know and it
also with that in mind we're kind of
preparing our registry where we
registered users are so sweet when I did
the live chat I was talking about
registering and we registered it by my
baby and you guys were like how can we
like if we want to send you again we
absolutely cherish the things you guys
have sent but anyway when we registered
we're still kind of through that phase
where I'm still
searching a lot of stuff so if you have
like one thing that you're like oh my
gosh Jessica this will change your life
when it comes to that first year of
having a baby please tell me below
because I want that one life changing
because of a bunch of you share one
thing that's more manageable for me to
like go through and say okay what should
I look into then because I think that
word of mouth is so much more powerful
than any review I could read online for
all these different things and it's
overwhelming
alrighty so hopefully that was like all
the little nitty-gritty details you guys
wanted to know I'm sorry I got emotional
in there but this is all just so
emotional and I've certainly been more
emotional lately nursery wise we're
still working on it but I do plan to do
kind of like a mini nursery tour in the
future once it's you know we're closer
to that date and once it's done and you
know we haven't had our baby showers or
anything like that yet either so but
other than that I hope you enjoyed and
I'll definitely give another update and
I don't know maybe a month or two we'll
see you know how it's progressing if a
lot changes I might do an update more
often but if not that I might wait till
the third trimester to give you a little
update but I love you guys I hope you
will follow along in my journey thank
you for doing so and we do upload vlog
stuff like our daily life on Tyler's
channel if you are interested I'll put
his link below because that's where we
put up our vlogs not just when we travel
but we do like kind of weekly vlogs from
time to time where you get to see a
little bit more of like the nursery and
other things were doing in the house and
all those kinds of things I'll put his
link below for his channel as well I
hope you'll subscribe then doing our
little family and I'll see you guys my
