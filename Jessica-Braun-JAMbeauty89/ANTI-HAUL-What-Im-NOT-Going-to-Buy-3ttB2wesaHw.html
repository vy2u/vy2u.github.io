going to share with you my second yes I
haul I did one maybe last month or a
couple months ago and it was so much fun
I got to be a little bit sassy I'm
usually very positive on my channel you
guys know that but it is kind of fun to
talk trash about from guys it's just
makeup
calm down it's just makeup but it is fun
to share with you guys my thoughts on
certain things that are maybe new right
now maybe trendy and they're just things
that I genuinely don't have an interest
in buying or owning of course it's just
my opinion you guys know that and I know
you guys take it with a grain of salt
because you have your own opinions as
well so I hope that you'll subscribe if
you like this kind of video give it a
thumbs up so I know and let's go and get
into it the first product I and I just
don't have an interest in buying is the
new Benefit Cosmetics cheek parade this
is one of their collections of their
boxed powders their blushes and an
bronzer and first of all I own most of
these on my own
Ida cluttered I was gonna say virtually
no every single one except for Dallas my
favorite I wear that all the time but my
thing with these is that oftentimes it's
not the same formula as the one in a
separate box I don't know why they do it
this way it's not true for all of them
but in my experience it's not always the
same quality and that is a huge bummer
because you think oh I'm saving all this
money by buying this kit but you're not
always getting the exact same product
now beyond that the packaging looks cute
etc but if you're ever wanting to travel
with that you're not going to bring that
big old bulky palette I mean you might
but I know me and I wouldn't this is my
opinion of course but I don't like big
palettes of face products I don't end up
reaching for them some of them I have I
do like but I also know myself and I
know I'd much rather just grab a
singular blush and use that so for that
reason I will not be spending fifty
eight dollars on that cheek palette the
next one I am going to pass on this time
around is the Tarte make believe in
yourself I and cheek palette this
results for $40 it has a little over
four stars on sephora's website it has
all these like kind of liar jewel tone
colors
Marie um just know I feel like it's just
another one of those tart palates that
ever lumps because it's limited-edition
it's got beautiful packaging and half
the time the quality is pretty good or
it's not you know it's kind of a gamble
with limited edition because reality is
with limited edition companies can pump
them out people will buy them because
it's special you can only get it now and
then once you get it you're like oh this
is kind of crummy or you know whatever
not to say that this is because I've
heard good things about it
but it's just another pallet with a
bunch of shades that don't necessarily
work well together and you can't
necessarily get a complete look out of
it and so for that reason I wouldn't be
able to use it as much as I'd like and I
can't recommend it to you guys once it's
gone it's gone so for me it wouldn't
even make sense but also I just know in
my heart that I wouldn't use it enough
to make it worth the $40 I'd rather buy
a pallet that's going to be around for a
while that if I really loved it and
somehow use it all up I could actually
buy it again
the next product is another pallet and
it's the urban decay jean-michel
basquiat I'm sorry I know I'm probably
saying that wrong
but it's a collection and it retails for
$39 which for an urban decay palette is
semi reasonable usually there's are 50
and 50 to you know a little bit up there
this does have less shades it looks like
it has one two three four eight shades I
just don't like the colors I got to be
honest was looking at the colors there's
like a chartreuse and a darker blue and
a lighter blue and kind of a I like the
dark purple and like the burnt orange
but for me I couldn't get a complete
look at it out of it or at least not
more than one complete look out of it
and for $40 and again a limited edition
it's one that I'm like I love urban
decay shadows pretty much across the
board urban decay shadows are always
good like even in their limited edition
I feel like they still usually are
pretty good sometimes there might be a
dud but across the board they're usually
pretty consistent which I appreciate but
this is just one that I will pass on
none of it looks inspiring to me at all
it just doesn't so for me it's just the
total pass the next one is a Smashbox
the legendary liquid lip why are
companies still making liquid lipsticks
not that they should get rid of the ones
they're selling now but to come out with
a new liquid lipstick range right now
when I feel like it's kind of not as
many people are buying them doesn't make
any sense it just doesn't it seems like
a huge way to money they're way behind
the game now I might be incorrect maybe
they've already had this out and I just
totally never heard about it but I feel
like this is new it was on Sephora's new
page I haven't heard of it until
recently so at least as far as I know
it's knit it's a new line smashbox lip
products are just not my favorite i
tried their lipsticks and I did not like
those at all now I do like they're
always on little lip colors those are
really comfortable those were great but
I presume this is more of like a dry
down liquid lipstick and I no no no no
there are so many of these it is
oversaturated in the makeup world you
can get really cheap ones that do the
exact same thing as this $24 one and so
for that reason I'm kind of in that part
where I'm like you know you really don't
have to spend $25 to get a good liquid
lipstick there are plenty of the drugs
or even the wet and wild liquid cat
suits those are not 100% amazing but
they give you pretty much the same
effect as any of these do and for that
reason pass this next one so Natasha de
Nona gives me a headache
and it'll she only gives me a headache
because I don't own anything yet by her
and it's so expensive and you know I've
heard good things about her eyeshadows
and all stuff that is so expensive I'm
like oh my gosh like that's another
brand that's really expensive that I
want to try but I don't want to spend
the money on but this is her sculpting
glow face this is $89 this is $89 for a
highlight and contour palette that again
I just don't like face products and
palettes I don't end up using all of the
colors in there and that bothers me I'd
rather buy singular shades that I know
work well for my skin tubs that have two
or three that I use in there and the
rest just don't work so I just don't use
them it just seems silly to me but
especially at $89 I'm sure these powders
are amazing it's just so much money all
of her stuff is so expensive I'd love to
try it one day but this would not be a
product I would spend the money on I
would rather spend that money on an
eyeshadow palette this next one I'm
going to tell you I think might rub some
people the wrong way and I know it will
and I'm kind of on the fence about
mentioning this one but one that I don't
I know that me myself I wouldn't buy it
is the sephora favorites kit it's there
give me some nude lip it's $28 you get
one two three four five six different
things it's a good deal no matter how
you look at it but they're all miniature
and the reason I mentioning is this is
because for me when I have a mini of
anything when it comes to lip products I
never use it I never use it
and I know how terrible that sounds I
might try it and kind of like it when
I'm looking at my lip tour and I'm
thinking something out my eyes just
automatically go over the mini and so I
think the person that this would be
perfect for is someone that you never
tried any of these things there's like
the NARS oh look why but you guys know I
love the Marc Jacobs ones I love that if
you're genuinely wanting to try these
because you're thinking about buying a
full price one then that makes sense or
if you just want to try all these and
you want it maybe you're building your
collection whatever it's not that this
is a bad deal it's actually a great deal
just for me I know myself and I would
buy that and be like oh yeah I've got
all these and then I would never ever
wear them and so if you're like me you
need to avoid it if you are buying it
for the right reasons then go for it
my next one is from Tom port it is one
of those duo's it's their cream and
powder eye color it is $62 now this is
similar to the ones that I've even tried
like from Estee edit where the bottom is
like a cream and then the top or maybe
the other way around the top with the
cream and the bottom with a loose powder
and they could be really pretty like you
could really make it punchy by putting
the loose powder on top of the cream but
the cream wasn't very creamy and so it
was it was just a weird kind of gimmicky
products that I never used or I ended up
getting rid of well this looks like it's
actually just a straight-up powder on
top and a cream on the bottom and for
$62 I mean I think of the palettes you
could buy with that I mean this better
if you're spending 62
this better be something that you are
going to use all the way up like a shade
like the one I'm looking at now is
called Sun worship it's like a gold and
kind of I would wear that but would I
wear it enough for it to be worth $62
absolutely never I mean that's so much
money for that I I can't imagine having
sixty two dollars to throw away on
something that I know I wouldn't use
enough to be worth sixty two dollars
holy moly total Pass so those are all of
my products for the anti haul this time
around if you enjoy it like I said give
this a thumbs up I will link my old not
old it's like a month ago
my last anti haul video down below for
your viewing pleasure now when I feel
like I talked about a lot more but this
one I was really kind of narrowing down
with things that I really felt strongly
about not buying I hope that you will
subscribe before you leave and I'll see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
