bringing you my very first anti haul in
this series was actually created by a
youtuber named Kimberly Clark I will
link her channel below she is hilarious
oh my gosh I get like stuck in a rut
where I can't stop watching her videos
like you can't definitely check her out
I think you will love her as much as I
do just watch one full video and I think
you'll get why I love her
the premise of this video is that you
share products that you know maybe
they're really hyped up or they're
really expensive or whatever it might be
or they're just brand new and they're
products that a lot of people are saying
go buy go buy go buy but maybe they're
ones that you know in your heart that
you don't need so I'm going to share a
bunch of products with you guys that I
am NOT going to buy that I know in my
heart that I don't need don't want won't
use can't afford whatever the reason
might be I'm excited let's go and get
into it if you've never seen one of
these videos I'm telling you right now
you're going to love this kind of video
I'm so excited
so first product I am NOT going to buy
is the Benefit Cosmetics dandelion
twinkle blush I like benefit blushes a
lot in fact I really liked the dandelion
blush I keep looking here because I've
got these products pulled up on a screen
here but this is $29 and I feel like
these kinds of blushes are ones that
I've ended up I've owned all of that and
I've gotten rid of all except for my
dallas blush I love that one it's the
perfect shade for me the rest of the
more good but they cooked up a lot they
kicked up they didn't cook up a lot of
power
that's the totally different story they
kicked up a lot of powder and I love to
smell of them but I didn't feel like
they were anything special not $30 worth
except for the Dallas powder and this is
one that it's just a kind of light blush
that has a little twinkle to it so it's
kind of a highlighter could be a blush
if you're as fair as I am I think I
think it's meant to be like a
highlighter but it's kind of a nudist
pink so you know it could be a blush
chopper I do not need another blush
topper shimmery light peaches pink blush
I've got like 10 million don't don't
don't need it pass next product I'm not
going to buy and this is nothing against
her
but it's the anasazi beverly hills
nicole guerrero glow kit I love
Cole I love her channel she is gorgeous
she's so talented but I can't spend $40
on a highlighting palette palette I have
like 5 highlighting palettes in my
collection I use like none of them I
continue to declutter so it's one of
those things that I know I will not get
nearly enough use out of that might kind
of dabble and use it for a few weeks and
then never use it again pass next
product I'm not going to buy is the new
YSL beloved tint in balm that is a $34
lip product where it's just like a
tinted lip balm they sell good tinted
lip balms at the drugstore why would I
spend $34 on a really fancy lip balm
Fausta christian dior like cream rose
lip balm that's like in a pot it's great
but it was really expensive and I would
never do it again because I realized wow
I have drugstore lip balms that I use
that I life even more or just as much
and they were way cheaper and you're
going to go through it or it will go bad
in the same amount of time so for
something like that is not worth the
money pass next product I'm going to
pass on is the UH Nastasia lip palette
and the Smashbox lip palette they're
these huge lip palettes I'm not a makeup
artist these this one for example the
anasazi ones $48 I am never going to use
that I'll probably use it like once or
twice but if I'm just using on my lip
it can't be worth the money because I'm
not doing that many crazy looks with
different colors that it would ever be
worth it and I'm certainly not going to
put that in my purse to you know touch
up throughout the day so I would
probably only use it in filming and
again there's like a red and a yellow
and a blue so there's some really funky
colors where if you like that and you
know you use it it's worth it but that's
a pretty hefty price tag for something
that you're probably not going to use
enough to make it worth fifty dollars
now if you're a makeup artist that makes
sense I know that I'm not so I'm going
to save my money and pass I hope this is
helping you guys because I feel like I
do so many videos where I talk about
products that I absolutely love and that
I think you should buy but I also try to
throw in a little flavor of but if you
look at this palette and you know you're
only going to use four of the 18 shades
then it's not worth buying I try to kind
of plant that in your head so you don't
feel like you have to go in too
five tons of stuff because that's not
what this is about and it's certainly
not why I started my youtube channel it
wasn't to make you guys into crazy
consumers where you buy a bunch of stuff
it's to make you guys smarter consumers
and to really think about and be
thoughtful about the products you're
buying for yourself you don't need
everything and not every trend it looks
good on everyone so anyway the next
product I'm not going to buy is this Tom
Ford cheer cheek duo
it's $78
now everyone smile I will splurge and
buy a really expensive product maybe
it's for my birthday maybe I have a gift
card maybe I'm just like you know what
I've worked hard this month I want to
buy a really nice expensive product but
this is something that it says it's more
sheer like why would I want something
that expensive that hardly shows up on
my face unless it's like life-changing
for my skin it's not ever going to be
worth it to me the packaging is stunning
as all Tom Ford packaging is and but I
just feel like this is one of those
products that it's just kind of like
mess and I feel like the pants might be
just a little bit too small I can't tell
how big it is but I think the pants
might be just a little bit too small for
my blush brush to get into the blush so
it's kind of one of those things that
yes it looks gorgeous the colors are
gorgeous too
it's not worth the money and I won't use
it enough to ever get that money worse
next product I am NOT going to buy is
the Benefit Cosmetics their rear real
double the lip lipstick and liner in one
if you see the shape of this it's kind
of like an a-sharp egg shape does that
make sense and so the idea is that you
can use the sharper side to line your
lips and the rest of it just fills it in
please I mean first of all I've wasted
mini lip liner so I actually and I
actually like using lip liners I like to
be more precise but I don't wear it
everyday I don't need with every color
especially for like some more nude
shades and I just feel like it's one of
those gimmicky products that yeah it
might work okay but do I really need
that absolutely not it's not going to
completely transform everything about
the way I do my lips no so it's kind of
those things that if I had it I would
use it but I don't need it so I'm gonna
pass next product that I'm not going to
buy are the new urban decay primers that
they came out with I have heard nothing
but negative things and I know a lot of
you guys have asked me maybe to review
them but I've heard from
and dry skin people that they're really
not anything to write home about and so
that tells me right away it is not worth
me spending the money and so the one I'm
looking at right now is the optical
illusion complexion primer is $34 I mean
there are a lot of different like kind
of blurring tight primers like that out
there that are really good I'm not going
to spend $34 just because it has Urban
Decay's name on it because I've heard
only bad things so I'm going to pass who
I'm sounding roll roll negatives so
those are all of the products I'm not
going to buy this month if you want me
to do these every single month please
let me know below because I have enjoyed
kind of be in like negative and sassy
with you guys because I feel like it's a
very positive place on my channel but
it's kind of fun to talk about products
but I know I don't need let me know what
you're not going to buy down in the
comments as well because I would love to
read it and it just might give me father
for my next monthly video and by the way
I'm just looking in the Sephora like the
just arrived new area of Sephora because
I feel like that's a lot of those are a
lot of things that a lot of people are
going to be looking at especially like
other youtubers and talking about you
know maybe buying and so I'm just
telling you right now I'm not going to
be buying those if you did enjoy it
hopefully you'll subscribe to catch more
definitely check out Kimberly Clark she
is lovely and I will see you guys in my
next video bye
