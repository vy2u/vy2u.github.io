have a video about the allure beauty box
now this is something this is the very
first time I finally been able to get my
freaking paws on it it's offered four
different times a year for each season
and this was the summer one I think it
was the summer one yes
summer must-haves I guess you ordered
before summer so you can use it in the
summer I guess I said anyway so this is
the summer one but they offer it in the
spring summer fall in winter now it
costs $45 I'm pretty sure it used to
cost $40 but this time it was like forty
four ninety five and then after tax and
shipping it was like $58 so it's like
why don't you just say it's $60 outright
and just say that includes shipping and
tax because that just made me mad I'm
like yeah hey $45 it's totally worth it
which it totally is but then I'm like
$58 like geez
but still worth it even at $60 this is
insane how much comes in it so this is
kind of the pamphlet that comes with it
you can tell there's a ton of products
every single thing in here is full size
and this booklet literally spotlights
every single product and it and gives
information about it and the website
that you can order it from very excited
to show you everything I'll try and
group it so we'll start with hair stuff
because there is a lot so one of the
first things in this kit is the
developed plus anti-aging hair treatment
system and it says that it fights Aging
in your hair hair loss it slows down
graying
it stimulates regrowth and minimizes
frizz I mean all kinds of things this
claims to do it's kind of shiny I see
that but yeah so it comes with three
different things three easy steps step
one is revive which is a clarifier step
two is restore which is a like a
conditioning mask and then step three
which i think is the small thing is a
rejuvenating elixir so I'm assuming it's
kind of like a serum so very interesting
I don't know if I will use this myself
if I want to pass it on to like my mom
or someone like that that might really
enjoy it you know but we'll see maybe I
will but I think I might give up
my mom it's too bad Mother's Day just
happened could have given it to her for
that oh well all right so more hair
stuff this one I'm excited about it's
the redken mess around 10:00 it's a
disrupting cream paste it looks like
this you know I don't know it's oh it
smells really nice it's kind of like
this weird thick can you guys see that
kind of paste be very interested oh it
feels really nice though it really does
have a nice smell to which is always a
win so excited to try that it also came
with a lot of hairspray which is perfect
because I swear to you I can't find a
hairspray that I love other than the
masterpiece hairspray by Bed Head which
by the way in like in the 20 may 20
something it's gonna be like $5.99 at
Ulta and it's originally like 1899 so
I'm literally gonna scoop up like three
of them I'm about to have so many hair
sprays but I don't care because that is
my favorite hairspray okay but okay so
it came with the alocs e style flexible
hairspray with medium hold which is I
mean these are all like I said full-size
so excited to give that a try but never
even heard of that brand and then this
is the sexy hair get layered hairspray
it came in like a box okay awesome again
can't wait to try it I'll take that out
of there
and then it also came with the rust
freezing spray humidity resistant
hairspray with extreme hold this will be
nice since it is summer and of course
most of these are themed like they'd be
good in the summer however I think most
of these are just new products which
makes sense that brands would want
everyone to know about their new
products so yeah alright
it also came at the Oscar blondie dry
heat protect spray I'm very interested
in this because the it's a dry spray
which is gonna be really nice because
half the time I'll use heat protectant
and I just hate it because it makes my
hair like wet and then it's crunchy and
so it's so hard to make myself use it so
this will be I think a really good
choice for me another thing is the GK
hair hair taming
system and whoa that's white I'm not
really sure what this will do thermal
styling cream okay
it's a heat-activated smoothing cream so
it protects your hair for a totally
sleek blow-dry so if I'm straightening
my hair which I might start doing more
often I don't know but um this would be
great for that okay
other hair stuff let's see this is the
pure ology fresh approach approach dry
condition I don't know how to hold these
up cuz they're so tall you know but I'm
excited to give this a try a dry
conditioner this is the second one I've
gotten and I still haven't tried the
other one so I'm assuming this will help
condition your hair but taming dry can
get moisture a little Allah it's pretty
evenly on the dry hair focusing on mid
links to ends okay I don't know we'll
see we will see is there any other hair
things I need to show yes oh there's so
much okay this is the one and only argan
oil derived from Moroccan argan trees
cream to serum styler so this is a
smaller little container but I'm
assuming oh yeah it's got 3.25 a lot of
these have pumps I mean this is just
great I am so excited man not to spoil
my hair another hair product theme not
your mother's intensive Henry unit
renewal treatment got a little pump
there it's just cute do you use this in
the shower work into wet hair that's
been washed and well rinsed leave for
one to three minutes and then rinse so
it's not a leave-in but it's just a one
that you rinse out but that's gonna
first of all it's gonna be so cute my
shower I like it okay so now body washes
they sent to different body washes this
is the soft soap sea kissed body wash it
smells good I was smelling it the other
night when I open this but this might be
one that I pass on to like my boyfriend
you know
actually okay that really does smell
like the ocean in the best way here
won't I don't know but that's one and
then this is one I already own and I
love it so I was excited to get it again
this is the Dove purely pampering
like pistachio and magnolia blossom is
that what it is pistachio cream with
Magnolia it just smells so clean I don't
really know but like real with the
perfect hint of sweet if you're at the
store smell it but the one downside it's
not as like thick and luxurious as the
other dove ones like the original dove
you know super moisturizing kind so
that's one of the downsides it's a
little runny err but it certainly
lathers walnut smells good but you know
I just love the smell are you kidding me
this is the Neutrogena ultra sheer face
and body stick and it's got SPF of 70
what am I supposed to do just like
deodorize my fit looks like a deodorant
seems what is in the cap there I don't
know what that is it's like a stain or
something that's weird
anyway um it just seems okay it says it
glides on easily for convenient
hands-free no mess application but
doesn't it seem kind of it seems weird
to me but I'll certainly use it I mean I
like the idea of it it just seems like
I'm still gonna have to rub it in don't
you guys you know I guess we'll see this
is the tan towel little box of towels
and it's supposed to put it's for fair
to medium skin tones it's concentrated
with the self tan formula give you a
quick and even application with no
streaking see that's where I feel like
there's no way it's not gonna streak
don't you feel I mean I'm gonna miss a
spa or something I don't know
and this says for a deeper tan you can
apply another tan towel after four hours
I mean I'm gonna try it but it just
seems interesting I'm just intimidated
by this stuff I'm sure a lot of you guys
know what I mean I have a self tanner
it's the Saint not st. Tropez it's like
the cheaper version but it's great
st. Moritz that's what it is and I
really like it it doesn't streak and
it's awesome so we'll try it this is the
Burt's Bees brightening even toned
moisturizing cream with Daisy extract
yeah with Daisy it says it evens your
skin tone it's just a face moisturizer I
want to see what it looks like it's got
a pump
please have a bomb okay looks like a
natural deodorant stick huh nope twist
Oh
popped right out yes it's got a little
pump yay okay this is adorable how many
ounces does it have 1.8 I mean it'll
take me a while to go through that yeah
yeah I'm excited
love facial moisturizers so that was a
win also comes with the Cetaphil gentle
skin Skin Cleansing Cloths a full-size I
haven't been you guys know that I
haven't been using makeup remover wipes
in a while but I mean I'm gonna give
this a try and I don't want any strike
just Cetaphil in general like the actual
cleanser so this might be a good
Testament to see how my skin reacts to
it to let me know whether I want to buy
like an actual cleanser with the same
sort of ingredients we will see okay
before I get to the makeup one last
thing the Rembrandt well what is it
deeply white plus peroxide really
excited because I have not tried Agron
Brandt toothpaste ever so that'll be
nice
and I think by the way so I've had
terrible you can probably see it I am hi
having terrible breakup break outs on my
chin right now and today I didn't want
to really conceal it too much because a
there at that point where they're dry so
it concealer almost makes it look worse
and I'm just going to I'm just like kind
of running errands today so it just
wasn't that big a deal but that being
said I think that my toothpaste is
breaking me out and I did some research
I know that sounds crazy but I'm using a
toothpaste I'm not used to using and
they've said that sometimes certain
toothpastes can make you react like and
break out around your mouth if you will
and I have had terrible breakouts around
my mouth now I'm like embarrass it's
just you guys you guys know me so I need
to switch toothpaste anyway I might just
go back to what I was using but I do
want to try this but I might wait and
get my skin back to normal and that is
it but I'm curious if any of you guys
have had that experience with changing
toothpastes that may be and I know it
could be hormonal but it's not that time
of the month so I just don't think it's
hormonal anyway
okay on to the delectable makeup so I'll
start with nail polish which is kind of
it came with this flower beauty like
bright orange nail polish yikes
what is this shade I have the Tiger Lily
that's adorable it makes me think of
Peter Pan which of course that's
certainly a fun color I do not have
anything this color of my collection so
it also came with these selling hands
and triple shine nail polishes one is
just a clear one and then this one is
like this really pretty sparkly you know
nonsense it looks gorgeous it looks
absolutely gorgeous so really excited
about those it also came with guess what
one of my favorites the Rimmel
scandaleyes mascara
isn't that funny I've gotten this in so
many different things now it's just it's
comical it's a good thing I like it
right it also came with this full-sized
Tarte lights camera lashes mascara how
freaking awesome is that this crap is
not cheap woah it also came with this
Neutrogena moisture smooth color stick
in bright berry which is just this
really really pretty
berry color it's an appropriate name for
it
I'm excited I've never tried me the
Neutrogena one so that'll be really
really nice these last two makeup items
I was very very excited about one is the
cargo essential lipgloss it just comes
in a little box and it's in the shade
well what shade is it I hate when it's
Oh too skinny oh that makes me happy
it's just this really pretty peachy
color and actually I have an old
lipgloss that I'd love to get rid of and
this would be perfect to replace it and
then I can get rid of the older one you
know the last thing that it came with
was the winner in my book and it's the
it cosmetics CC cream full-size this
sucker is crazy expensive and I've been
wanting to try it here's the downside
you don't get to pick your shade I do
not understand that I do not understand
now I get that this is a crazy awesome
deal and it's easier for them and
shipping to just have everyone getting
the same thing would it be so easy to
have a little drop-down box when you're
ordering and say I'm light tone or
medium or dark because really there's
not that many shades in this range
unfortunately but so everyone got medium
everyone so the really dark skinned
girls have got medium that's not gonna
match the super pale girls like me have
got medium which is way too dark and
there's no like exchange process
like this sucks so I've got medium which
sucks because it's way too dark I don't
even think in the summer look at that
maybe in the summer maybe but I'm really
sad because it feels so luxurious so
this is what it looks like up close
just pretty even cute packaging but it's
got a little pump which I love and let's
do a little look how dark that is are
you kidding me that would never work oh
my gosh not in a million years not in a
freaking million years maybe with self
tanner I'm just so sad I'm just so and
somewhat one of my subscribers that said
well I you know their friend like works
for Sephora and so her friend was
letting her like exchange I'm like I
want to exchange mine if any of you guys
are able to do that for me I don't know
like I really really want it in the
lighter color this is not gonna work and
I'm so sad because it feels so nice
anyway so that was a bummer it was so
exciting to get it was such a bummer so
you know anyway that all of that was $60
you kidding me that's so much stuff even
though it was 45 but advertised so
totally worth it here's the deal with it
though you have to I followed this blog
called Nouveau cheap if you gosh if you
don't know about that blog you've got to
because that's how I found out about all
kinds of sales all kinds of crazy like
freebies just she is amazing and she
constantly compiles all the best deals
like around town or in the world I don't
know I mean at least in the United
States he doesn't live near me so it
doesn't matter anyway Wow library so she
like has on her Instagram she'll post
deals like this and she said you know
the allure beauty box is coming up you
know make sure you set your alarm and
it's like at noon or whatever it is
anyway so you learned have to sit on the
site and wait and then like buy it right
away because it sells out within like 20
minutes and I posted a thing on my
Instagram when it was going on and I
think some people got it in time and
that others didn't because it was just
the time frame so quick so if you're not
following me on Instagram you definitely
should because I usually will post a lot
of times I'll put I post about that
I also post about like not Knicks the
bomb will have 50% off site-wide sales
all the time I always post about that as
well and just all kinds of other things
so definitely check me out on there and
on Twitter and hopefully this video is
helpful I know now you can't buy it so
it's like yeah thanks for showing us
that but you can't buy it but I wanted
to show you a bunch of products that I
got so a you know that I'll be trying
these out and reviewing them for you
letting you know what I feel about them
but also to let you know about you know
in the next season's coming up that it's
so totally worth your money are you
kidding me I mean this alone is what
like almost $40 so of course it's the
shade I can't use anyway I'll catch you
guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
