have my April favorites for you and I
know it might look different behind me
and that would be because it is
different I kind of moved my room around
back to the way I used to have it which
I liked so much better but you know how
you get in those moves where you just
want something to change so you should
just like rearrange your room or
whatever so I just moved it back to the
way I like it now but um but yeah so I'm
actually in the same position in my room
but you know there's different severa
around me yeah hmm it's spring right
it's like spring cleaning I'm my family
we always have like a huge garage sale
and ours is coming up so I've been like
going through clothing that I'm gonna
get rid of there's so many good things
but you know you just get that feeling
where you just like I need to purge I
need to get rid of things and so yeah
it's been kind of a nice wind down from
the semester of hard work so anyway
okay so I have some favorites for you
all yeah okay so one thing that I've
been loving is this Milani baked blush
um it's in the shade Luminoso and I'm
wearing it today actually and it's just
so nice like this watch doesn't even do
good justice but I was surprised that
this did look okay on my skintone and I
would be even more beautiful on a darker
skin tone but I just love it you don't
need a highlighter with it you don't
really need anything with it and I just
think it's just so glowy and you know
what I mean it kind of gives you that
dewy effect without actually having a
dewy face you know what I'm saying
love this okay another favorite is the
Sigma f80 no f-86 brush the tapered
kabuki I use this to apply my concealer
here and mostly because it's angled you
can really get in there but I love this
and I've been reaching for it every
single time I do my concealer I used to
use like my Beauty Blender you know but
I've been using this more I just love it
I like the way it blends it into your
skin and what's so nice about it you
know when you are putting on concealer
and sometimes it'll blend out too much
so that it's not even concealing
anything anymore
but then on the other hand if you don't
blend it enough it looks like patchy or
cakey or just weird this kind of
balances those out and so it actually
continue it leaves the concealer so that
it actually is concealing still but it
blends it out enough that it really does
look flawless it doesn't look patchy or
cakey or anything like that it is
amazing and this is like if you can buy
one brush from Sigma I would recommend
this one because you could use it for
foundation all over your face you could
kind of make it work for you but and of
course I use it for concealer and that's
it's a dream love it okay another
favorite this kind of all mixed in this
is the tazos NT and I think a box of
these is like maybe around five dollars
maybe less um it's you know kind of
middle-of-the-road tea I love this stuff
you drink it every single night and it's
just so relaxing and calming and I was
surprised to find out that there is
caffeine in this but I don't it doesn't
give me like a jolt of caffeine like you
know coffee would it somehow still
relaxes me I don't know what it is in
this tea it's not too flavored but it's
just kind of a nice tea I don't know
I've been buying this now since December
since my sister introduced it to me at
Christmas and I I can't stop I'm like
addicted to tazos NT at night but it's
just so nice and relaxing so if you're
kind of looking in the market for a new
tea I would say try this one okay
another favorite ok the Revlon kissable
balm stain this is in the shade honey
I'm wearing it today and these are nice
because they smell like mint and they
really do stay on for a long time and
they wear off nicely but when I first
bought these I thought I would have to
sharpen this I was like what no they
twist up
how convenient right I'm sorry
pleasantly surprised by that I really
like these and even if you don't like
this shade they have so many different
colors to choose from and they're pretty
reasonably priced of course because they
are drugstore love it ok another
favorite is this bracelet oh I brought
it from shop lately but of course my
favorite website and I'll link it down
below if you'd like to check it out I
know that if you sign up using your
Facebook account you get credit towards
the site like right away I don't
remember exactly how much it might be
five dollars or might be fifteen I'm
sure but I know that you do get credit
if you sign up to your Facebook account
so I believe the link anyway this
bracelet I love it's stretchy you can
wear it with literally anything as long
as it you know involves gold but it's a
great sacking bracelet but it's also
great on its own because it's just so
dainty but it has these you know like
pyramid like studs with little fake
diamonds you know and then just these
gold beads and then it's just kind of
like braided string on the sides of it
and it's stretchy like I said so it's
great if you've got thin wrists but it
will kind of fit any wrist size which is
nice um you know cuz sometimes I don't
know if you guys know what I mean but
like some bangles are just so big that
they're so clingy you're just like this
is ridiculous you feel like you're a
show you know what I mean just like all
these like pots and pans hanging from
your cars anyway so this is a nice
alternative of course this isn't a
bangle but you know what I'm saying I
love this bracelet and it was like I
think like four or five dollars if I'm
not mistaken so of course everything on
that site is pretty inexpensive
okay another favorite is this Maybelline
quad it's in taupe temptress and my
friend Sarah just recently sent me these
along with a bunch of wet and wild
palettes and I can't thank her enough
for it so thank you
because it's just been so fun to play
with these but this has been kind of a
standout of them these shadows are just
so pretty okay let me see if I can
swatch a few
they're just so pigmented and they look
great with brown eyes which I have never
really worn like kind of red shadows so
burgundy shadows but I am in love with
this I just keep reaching for it and
even if I'm not wanting this dramatic
look with this darker when I'll use
these lighter colors you know so I love
that so much and those are available in
stores I just checked and then my last
favorite is this elf single eyeshadow
and taupe it's beautiful it's a dollar
these are a dollar and they said oh my
gosh look at that I love it it's that
kind of a gold tint to it but it
definitely is a taupe color and it's got
a little shimmer but not too much and
they sell their ELF compacts like the
empty quads where these fit and they're
magnetized but you can also fit Mac
shadows in them so it's great and it's
oh my gosh the mirror in it is great
so with me I don't have one with me
right now or else I'd show it to you but
they're so nice and they're only a
dollar and then these are only a dollar
so you can kind of create your own quad
for five dollars a dollar for the thing
and then four dollars for the shadows
it's amazing and those are great for
travel because that way if you lost your
makeup bag or it got stolen
you're only you know that's only five
bucks and you can get they have so many
different shadows to choose from but
this is my favorite and again it's in
taupe I love it you can wear it all over
your lid or you can use it just kind of
as your base color which is what I did
today with it
it's just kind of a light look and then
you can add things so you know what I
mean on top of it but I love it okay so
those are my April favorites I hope you
enjoyed and please subscribe bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
