favorites day and I actually have one
kind of miss that I also wanted to
mention because it's an expensive
product and I was really not impressed
so I'm excited to get to it
so I feel like I've been gone and I know
that I've been uploading videos here and
there but it's certainly not as much as
I have been doing and that would be
because I've been helping Tyler my
fiance move and we're really getting
into thick into the thick of wedding
planning and yes I'll have a video
coming up kind of kind of like all the
questions I've been asked about my
wedding I'm going to answer so that is
coming here in the next few weeks and
then just like we were training for the
mini marathon which I actually literally
like hours ago finished the half
marathon here in Indianapolis where I
live and just all these different things
in like the school year starting to wrap
up so like it feels like everything has
just come to a head and so I had
actually the way that my schedule is I
have to film a lot of videos at one time
on the weekends and I had filmed a lot
of past videos so I've been able to
upload and I still have more I've got
more declutter videos coming I've
already filmed my makeup collection
video but it's just gonna take me a
while to edit and get it just right so
if you're noticing by the way in my
declutter videos that I've heard a lot
of people say like wait where is this
product and this I filmed the whole
declutter series like honestly at this
point it's been like a month maybe even
two months so I've gotten a lot of
products since then which is the nature
of my job but even still that would be
why you're not seeing them but that
declutter series is almost done okay Wow
huge preface let's get started so the
product I wanted to mention that I hated
this month is the Becca radiant skin
creamy concealer and it comes in just a
silver tube like this and it's just got
a little brush or a wand applicator and
I got it in the shade banana and it's
kind of a yellowish shade which honestly
is just the shade is not the issue
but it's so thick and when I say thick I
don't mean like in a
there are some products like the benefit
you're a space those are really thick
concealers but you can blend them out
and they look great I can't get this
stuff to like blend out it's like tacky
and so as I pull on it it's just
highlighting every single dry spot I
have on my face which under your eyes of
course you've got all the I mean I have
little fine lines and areas where I've
squinted and you can I mean you can see
that and this was the worst stickiest
thing I don't know how to describe it I
don't know if I got a bad one or what
but I I mean it's so like tacky but not
in a good way it's so bizarre so I would
say stay away from this maybe I got a
dud I certainly don't feel like spending
the money to get another one and it's
been too long to return it I think plus
I've used it too much because I kept
trying it in different ways and it is
just all-around terrible so do not spend
your money stay away okay the next thing
I wanted to bring out is a favorite and
this is the Milani shadow eyes now this
is in the shade almond cream and it's
just one of those thicker jumbo pencil
type products and again that's actually
a similar color to that but it's just
the perfect I think it's a great shadow
primer so I'll usually put it all over
my lid and then just blend it in it
completely erases any discoloration you
have on your eyelids and it holds on the
shadows so well I was so impressed with
this i sharpened it once it's sharpened
really well and it just stays on all day
and I really notice the difference
between when I use this before putting
on shadow and when I don't because not
only does it hold on the shadow really
well but it also just does such a great
job of blanking out that canvas that my
shadows just look better all of my looks
look more put together than when I don't
use it so I love this this is so cheap
at the drugstore another favorite is
this essence gel eyeliner this is like 2
or 3 dollars and I got it in the shade
Midnight in Paris which is just their
black and I thought I'd heard some
pretty good things and I thought well
it's 2 or 3 dollars it could be amazing
or it could be terrible it is amazing
I'm wearing it today a lot of people
have asked I've been
for the past like two months and I love
it and I am pretty sure when I'm done
with this I will repurchase it because I
find that it's just it's perfectly in
between too creamy and too thick it's
just right in between and so I feel like
I've got a lot of control with it and I
just I love this so much I'm so glad I
tried it because I really like the
Loreal one and the Maybelline one but
they're like double the price still not
too expensive but this is just such an
amazing deal definitely try it if you're
looking for a really really black opaque
cream liner okay
next product I wanted to mention this is
like huge a subscriber sent this to me
in the brand that she and I think she
invented this is color clutch and it's
literally color clutch calm and she sent
this to me quite a while ago and I've
been kind of trying it out in deciding
how I liked it and I wanted to mention
it because it is really cool and I love
when subscribers have really cool
companies and things they've started or
that they're a part of and I love
mentioning them so this holds I think it
was 18 I have the site pulled up because
I didn't want to screw it up
because this is really cool it holds 18
polishes and I picked tons of different
brands that I own to show you that it
really does fit like every brand every
shaped bottle so like I've got some
butter LONDON ones put in your sideways
I've got OPI Orly wet-and-wild
just random Zoya Sally Hansen even
square bottles like this isn't if I can
get it out this is an ill amass Co one
that's like a square and it it does fit
it's a little harder to get out but it
does fit so I mean I see everything and
so I thought this was so cool this I
know she has to because she's got this
color which I love like this lavender
lilac color and then she also has like a
really pretty blue one I'm looking at
and these are $29.99 and I know that she
also has like these travel ones how many
is it holds eight and it's like a zip
around case as well if you want to
travel with it now for me when I'm
traveling I usually will bring like a
nail polish and I have to put it my
liquids bag if I'm flying so for me that
wouldn't be an option but this is cool
too by the way because the idea is that
it's really compact so you can literally
slide it in
- like your bookcase and it would just
be like the size of a book or you could
slide it into a drawer and then just
pull it out anytime you need it and it's
magnetically closed here I just thought
it was cool I wanted to mention it I'll
put a link to her site below in case you
are interested in at least checking it
out because it's awesome so this is the
bed night luxury powder in cameo now I
know if you know about the Ben Nye
powders you're used to seeing them and
like those bigger like jars
well they now sell women like these
sifter type containers and when I saw
that I was like what
so I actually bought this and I bought
banana let me find it
I bought banana as well and they were a
little bit cheaper and you know this is
something that I will never go through
one in my lifetime so I didn't feel sad
that I was getting less product because
I would never go through one of those so
you can kind of see the difference
banana is very yellow and cameo is very
I mean kind of pinkish white so for me
the pinkish white cameo makes way more
sense because I am more fair although
I'm a bit sunkissed from the race today
anyway I love this stuff it brightens so
I'm wearing it today it brightens so
well your under eye I haven't used it
alone I always wear it over a concealer
but I would imagine that would have some
coverage even alone but I like it as a
setting powder I've used banana it
doesn't look like crazy
I had heard tales of people that are
fair like I am using it and they felt
that it was very like yellow so it just
looked yellow III just noticed that it
cancels out some discoloration I just
like this one better but if you are a
deeper skin tone I think this would be
beautiful I don't regret having both but
I do like cameo better it's really cool
so this is okay they had sent me this
and they let me go through this the
company sent bird and I had heard and
seen a lot of my youtube friends on here
showing this and they said that they
would send me one but they wanted me
just so I could see what it was like if
I wanted to share it with you guys
what like the process is like on their
website so I went on and it was kind of
interesting and I have to admit I am
really picky when it comes to perfumes
so I'm going through this thing thinking
there's no way they're gonna match
with the perfume that I actually like
because I'm so picky and I'm sure most
of us are so that you go through and
like they ask you what kind of do you
like you know berries or do you like
floral scents or do you like in a month
this is so generic so I click it and
then the next question is a little more
specific and so you answer in three or
four I don't remember how many questions
and then they narrow it down and then at
the end they say okay here are top picks
for you based on this survey and I saw
that one of them was what is it actually
called Lancome la vie a bell and I've
heard of it and I'm like maybe and I've
never really smelled it and then they
had a few other they had suggested Viva
La Juicy which is one of my favorites in
my poll they're pretty good they know
that I would like that so I went with
the Lancome one and so when I let them
know they sent it to me and it comes
okay this is what blew my mind I'm just
showing Tyler this and he's like okay
that's the coolest thing ever do they
have it for guys and I actually don't
know if they do I need to look anyway so
they send you this empty container and
this cute little scent bird-like velour
pouch and then this is already in it and
so you just kind of push it down and
then it twists down here and it's of
course a spray nozzle but what they do
is for $15 a month you get a new one
like in your like perfume Cuse you add
ones you want to try and you can change
it as much as you want and so the next
month they charge you $15 and so then
they send you this point two seven ounce
perfume of whatever you had chosen and
I've used this like crazy this month and
it's only gone down this much and I use
it like twice a day like three spritzes
each time this scent is unbelievable um
oh my gosh like I want to get just this
set every time I don't know but I think
this is a pretty cool way to just try
out different things and I know my
friend it's Kirsten here on YouTube has
talked about scent board and really
likes them as well I wish I wonder if I
could find the video where she talks
about it too
I really like it also I really like this
perfume for me as a traveler this is
incredible and it's so shielded so I'm
not worried about it like busting open
or anything like that and I just think
it's a really cool idea if you're
wanting to try different perfumes and
you don't really know where to start
it's not a huge investment all at once
and it's just it's awesome and beside
note about the scent la vie a bell I
think I'm saying that right Tyler loves
it and I love like my misty or and my
Viva La Juicy he likes and I know he
likes misty or a lot but when he smelled
the zombie he was like what are you
wearing and I told him and he was like
that's literally the best thing I've
ever smelled ever I'm like oh I might
need to buy a full-size of this
eventually so awesome okay last week a
favor I'll talk about is this everyday
minerals cheek blush it's a like a
powder no it's like a loose blush and
it's in the shade Primrose and so it's
this really just kind of light pink
color I'm not wearing it today I should
have thought that through I usually am
really good about that um this okay
here's what I'll say I never would have
thought I would have liked a loose blush
because you think it's so much more work
and this shade and this formula is so I
mean it's just kind of a mess I kind of
dumped some into the lid just get it but
it's worth the mess because it just got
in the air it does not move and it looks
like this airbrush just like perfectly
blushed look I don't know how to
describe it and I've never gotten this
look from any blush I've ever tried and
no I'm not sponsored by them or anything
I mean this is just amazing I thought
might invite a cause I'm sure they sell
everyday minerals I know I've seen it in
like organic and health food stores that
sell makeup I've seen this brand but
like I said I got mine on Vitacost they
have I think a couple of high mosa
flavors um
flavors one right color shades cheese
they have a few shades that they sell of
this this is just the one that I fallen
in love with and if I ever did run out
which I highly doubt I will but if I did
I would rebuy it again I traveled with
this when I traveled this was one of the
ones I took I'll probably take it with
me on my honeymoon
I might even wearing on my wedding I
just don't know I'm still narrowing it
down I love this so much you guys would
- I'm telling you it's unlike anything
I've ever tried so those were all of my
favorites and kind of not favorites this
month I'll have links below for some of
the products that I mentioned
hopefully this is enjoyable I've missed
you guys so much um anyway I will catch
you guys in my next video
