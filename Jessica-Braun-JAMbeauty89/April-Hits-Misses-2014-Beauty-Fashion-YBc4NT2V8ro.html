April favorites and I actually have some
things I did not like as well that I
returned and let's go ahead and start
with those because I realized I always
forget to mention things like if I
returned and didn't like it I don't
remember it of course and then I never
mentioned it to you guys so I'm like I
am failing you guys I am failing so I've
decided to not fail this time and
mention that things that I returned so
I've been trying to branch out and try
different cleansing oils and the reason
I like cleansing oils so much is for me
I can just use that product and be done
so I can use the cleansing oil to remove
my makeup and to cleanse my face and
it's just it's sort of moisturizing but
not too much it's I'm gonna do a whole
video on this soon but I had tried the
basha makeup breakup one that a few
people in here and recommended but for
my skin it didn't remove my makeup as
well I'm pretty sure it was breaking me
out I mean and I only tried it a few
times I thought you know what I'm not
gonna keep it it was expensive I'm gonna
return it so I returned it to Sephora by
mail and then I tried another one if I
can remember what it's called all listed
below cuz I can't think of it I tried
that one didn't like it returns it as
well the good news is before is awesome
about that even by mail it's free they
give you the free return label so anyway
so I tried to and I'm like oh my gosh
forget it I'm just gonna buy the Josie
Maran one because I have been trying the
small size that a friend sent me and I
love it and this sucker has lasted me
it's only 1.9 fluid ounces this sucker
and I saw this much left has lasted me
literally months and months and months
it's insane so I thought I'm just gonna
buy the full size it'll last me like a
year if not more so I finally said
forget it I'm gonna buy it super
expensive but I love it and it's a one
step product I don't need a makeup
remover I don't need makeup remover
wipes I don't need a face wash I mean
this does it all for me
so I finally brought it really excited
guess what ladies so the next day on
HauteLook which you know I'm obsessed
with that website because there's stupid
stupid insane deals josie maran is on
the next day and I'm like oh yeah so I
went on and I see that they have these
in this size the 2-pack for 12 bucks I'm
like are you freaking kidding me
I could have bought like a million two
packs for 12 dollars and had way more
than this and I was like well then I'll
just return this once I get it in the
mail and I'm like are you serious that's
like three returns of cleansing oil
sabor is gonna be like what is up but I
decided to keep it because I love the
fact that as a pump because the thinness
it's kind of a squeezy one and so what
I'm gonna do is a I'll have this for
travel yay also I can take those because
I did end up buying the 2-pack of course
I can refill this if I need so it was
really a win-win but it was just kind of
a ridiculous story so no I'm not oily
but it's not so good
but I'll do a whole cleansing oil video
soon I promise because I know a lot of
people I it took me a long time to even
understand what cleansing oils were used
for but I'll do a video on that soon I
promise
okay so I got a lot of favorites so
another favorite of mine we haven't
gotten to the makeup yet is this akha
kappa brush and it's just a wooden
handle brush it has synthetic and boar
bristle a mixture and i loved it it was
like again it was on HauteLook it was a
really expensive brush but i think i
ended up getting it for like 25 or 30
dollars which i know sounds stupid
expensive for a brush i remember when i
told my mom she was like you paid what
fur brush i was like i know it sounds
stupid but but I've been losing not
losing hair but my hair had been
breaking so I was then it's not a lot of
hair in my brush and I'm like and I've
always kind of been like that even when
I was young and I didn't heat style my
hair but I'm like you know I'm 25 I'm
not old by any means but you got to take
care of your hair no matter what your
age is and since I've been noticing it
I'm like I've got to like make some
changes so I'm using this agave oil trio
that I'm really excited to review for
you guys soon just to kind of help
strengthen and condition it so it
brushes out easier too and then I figure
I should switch up my brush cuz I'd
always just kind of use whatever brush I
never really gave much thought to it but
I did a lot of research and heard that
this like with boar bristles and
synthetic that it was good for you of
course you can have just boar bristles
as well but I thought this would be a
good one for me I have been loving this
I've noticed so much less breakage it's
crazy it's crazy I really didn't think a
brush can make a difference but I really
think it has and my hair just feels
better it just feels better and it's
just weird I never thought a brush would
matter but I really think it actually
does anyway woah my throat already hurts
Oh No
all right
so let's dig in shall we this is a
rediscovered favorite my Milani baked
blush it's in the shade Dulce pink I
love it
ah the brush fell out it is the most
beautiful like it's just so shimmery
which I know is a big turn-off for a lot
of people it's kind of washed out isn't
it there we go but it's just so pretty
on the cheeks and I think it's one that
it doesn't matter if you're really fair
tan or really dark I don't think it
matters your skin tone I think it's just
if you're really dark it'd be really
glowy and if you're light it adds a
little bit more pigment but it's also
glowy
it's just glowy across the board but it
never looks weird chunky shimmery and it
never looks like it always looks like a
fresh wash of color which is exactly
what you want in your blush usually so
and it constantly amazed me every time I
pull it back out I'm like I keep
forgetting how good this is it's better
than to be frank it's better than the
matte blushes that I own I really really
really really love this so a million
thumbs up for Dolce pink because I just
love it and I have movie knows so but
for me and my skintone I really didn't
like it but this is a little bit Pinker
and I just like it look another favorite
now this is new for me I have been
trying to use mineral products on my
face instead of liquid foundation
because as the weather is getting warmer
I figure I want to just kind of give my
skin some breathing room and I feel like
mineral foundations there's a little bit
more breathing room for your skin I
don't know if it's your or not but I
love to think that so I've been using
the elf mineral foundation in porcelain
and it just comes in this little pot you
know it's nothing special but I mean it
looks just like bare minerals packaging
dang it I got like in my phone in the
grooves in my phone but it comes in this
packaging I think it's like five or six
dollars on eyes lips face comm and of
course they always have sales this stuff
is unbelievable I apply it with my sigma
f84 whatever the flat top one is f
eighty brush it's flawless alone ladies
I let me emphasize this again I always
use liquid foundation
always because I feel like you know I've
got freckles I've got like a little bit
of hyperpigmentation I figure there's no
way I can cover that up with something
that's not a liquid this covers it up
better than a liquid I can't wrap my
brain around how it does it
I really can't it stays on all day I was
sweating I went to the gym I came home
it was flawless and it was just this a
moisturizer and this no liquid anything
no primer even just it's unbelievable if
you haven't tried mineral foundation I'm
sure all you ladies out there that use
mineral foundation all the time or like
yup that's it because it's so amazing
now of course this is the cheapo version
which I love the bare minerals of course
it might be even better I've never tried
the bare minerals foundation but it's
gotta be at least just as good if not
better but the elf one is a million
thumbs up as well now on the same token
I do have the bare minerals concealer
and well rested I just recently bought
this this stuff is so good on its own
you don't need any concealer under it I
use a small kind of a small fluffy brush
I realized I used to use a small dense
brush and it was putting too much
because this is like this packs a
freaking punch but if you use a small
fluffy brush almost like an eyeshadow
brush almost like an eyeshadow company
it's just the perfect coverage it really
is I'm wearing this today I actually am
wearing a liquid foundation today
because I'm trying out another one but
but this concealer is unbelievable now
today the concealer combo i use is the
maybelline instant age rewind in it's
just the brightener shade yeah and it
just looks like this and it's got this
little sponge on top that you twist if
you haven't seen this you twist that and
then it comes out and then you just rub
it on your face you know but a lot of
times if you really want a nice
brightening look without any shimmer
this is awesome because you can go all
the way out there if you want heck you
can even put it down virgin you know you
can put it wherever you want but are you
usually just stick to here this stuff is
amazing on its own and over concealer
but I have been wearing it alone and
then if you top it with the well rested
it's like a Byam glow city my glow I
mean like bright city bright city bright
bright city okay I gotta find room on my
little table here I need to invest in
like a
Rea like from targeting are they at the
cute trays to put all my favorites cuz I
always have like a million all right I
guess that's a good sign though I'm
trying a lot love it a lot and not love
it a lot okay one of the things speaking
of that I did not love is this
wet-and-wild limited edition palette and
walking the red carpet look at all these
beautiful colors right I saw it on
Instagram I was like funk need it I'm
extra silly today sorry it's like rainy
and I'm going to the zoo today with my
little nephew though I'm excited that's
a sex point I was really excited seeing
this I'm like oh my gosh look at that
gold it looks like urban decay
half-baked
this looks like a million shadows that
I've been wanting they stopped I was
just so pretty um I got it and I was
like knit it looks beautiful
it's crazy chunky and lots of fall out
crazy glitter
I think it's washed out too much to even
see I don't know so I was really
disappointed in the shimmery colors but
there is this one color right here that
I talked about in my haul video that's
the perfect like nude I even use it in
the crease it's just so beautiful so for
that shadow alone I love it the rest it
was a letdown it really was the good
news is it's only 5 bucks I mean it's so
usable if you're if you know you love
these colors and you don't mind a ton of
glitter and I'm telling you like glitter
fallout city you'd like it but I really
really like that color than that mmm I
don't think I would repurchase it I
can't return it now it's pretty long
okay so another product that out of the
air is this starlooks gel liner it's in
the shape black hole which is just their
black and it was from when Ashley
Hackman did a thing I highly doubt
that's gonna did it did it focus there
is no I struggle with the focus on this
camera I think everyone does but anyway
it's just a normal black gel eyeliner
but it's awesome it stays on all day
I've had no issues it might be one of my
it might be one of my favorite gel
eyeliners I've ever used now on that
token I also recently bought and you saw
it in a recent haul however I actually
bought it weeks ago so I've been trying
it out for a while the Smashbox gel
liner it's just in their classic little
Smashbox pot it's in the shade caviar
and again it's just a normal black liner
however it sucks
really sucks I was so I got it on really
cheap at a CCO but I wish I could return
it the CC goes too far and I don't know
if you can return it in plus I've
clearly used it a decent amount I just
don't like it it's like it doesn't have
as much pigmentation as this and any
other gel liner I've used and it just
sucks its ears everywhere
it's weird I was so disappointed I'm
like Smashbox you need to get it going
because I've heard bad things about
their colored ones too like they're
colored liners so I'm like what's going
on
okay another favorite is this Anastasia
brow Wiz I mean it's just a pencil it's
got a spoolie on one end and it's like
the perfect sized spoolie and then just
a retractable liner on the other
I haven't medium brown it's a perfect
match it's so much quicker than using
the Anastasia powder
I love the anasazi a powder but this is
better and quicker so I'm hoping I don't
run out of it quickly though because it
is pricey and I hate that but I haven't
found that drugstore pencil that doesn't
pull red on me so if you have any
suggestions please let me know but
everyone I've ever tried always pulls
just a little bit red enough that I
notice it and hate it so let me know if
you have a drugstore one that you really
really like because I'd love to spend
less money on that you guys know me I'm
cheap I'm a cheapskate okay this is the
CEO Bigelow menthol lip shine guys I've
had this since Christmas my sister got
it for me and she swears by it but when
I first used I was like and it's too
sticky it is too sticky but the more
I've used it I realized I was putting on
way too much it was like a sticky thick
layer but I like a couple weeks ago I
started wearing it just like in a thin
layer before bed it's so good and it
actually is moisturizing I thought it
was drying on my lips but I think I was
just putting too much on I don't know
but it smells amazing it feels really
nice if you put a really thin layer and
like work it in your lips instead of
just putting it on top of it do you know
what I mean I love it
and I know a lot of people like this but
I was just like an but boy I love it
it's almost like a lip treatment of
course she most people I think wear it
out but I like it as well sweetness
speaking of lips I love this Milani
raspberry rush I've talked about a
million times in my Mac and drugstore
haul video a lot of people are asking
what I was wearing it was this it's just
by Milani hate the smell a lot of people
like it though
it's just a really fun color and what I
like about it I don't think the staying
power is crazy awesome for this one but
what I liked about it is that it's kind
of almost like chromatic not really but
kind of if you own it or if you ever
seen it in person you can kind of see
what I mean it's just so beautiful
though I just you have I have to wear a
lip liner with it because otherwise it
looks crazy actually in that video I
didn't wear lip liner and like when I
was looking up close I was like like
it's just like jagged because like I
said I don't think the wear time is the
best for this so definitely a lip liner
with this Max beat would look great at
this that's what I usually wear but okay
another favorite is the elf mineral face
primer a lot of you guys have been
asking me what I think about this cuz on
Instagram I've been posting that I've
been wearing this a lot lately and if
you don't follow me on there I hope you
will because I put a lot of like face of
the days like what I'm actually wearing
each day not every day but every couple
of days and I post a lot of fun beauty
things on there so anyway and a lot of
like when their sales I'll post the
thing on there so you know anyway elf
mineral face primer I think it's like 5
or 6 bucks and I love it it's got pump
the packaging is adorable and it's just
this clear primer but it feels a lot
like the Smashbox photo-finish
it's very velvety to the touch I don't
know if it's because there's silicon in
it or what but it's very velvety it's a
really nice slate for your face now I
haven't been using primer lately cuz I'm
like I said I'm just giving my skin a
break as much as I can but it's it's
lovely I've been reaching for it over my
smashbox which i really liked my
Smashbox so that's like a big deal
speaking of those are dupes for each
other i'm gonna be doing a dupes video
soon and i cannot wait because it's my
first dupes video and I have a list
that's like actually one of my other
favorites I might as well show you I've
been like doing decorating which sounds
so silly but I'm done student teaching
right now and I'm
so I've been like decorating things and
so these are my lists of drugstore dupes
this was actually my list for my April
favorites I loves and hates but so
another favorite of mine and I actually
did bring it forward to show you guys is
well like stationary items I know a lot
of you guys are probably just as
obsessed as I am but this is kind of new
to me because I've always liked stickers
and things but I never really got into
it but I just ordered my first erin
condren life planner oh my gosh
if you don't watch any videos on it
Belinda Selene does a lovely one where
she shows how she organized how she
decorates it actually most of all and
I've learned a lot from her and I'm
really excited to kind of as I get used
to it do my own video on how I ended up
organizing and planning because I'm a
very organized person so I went to the
dollar store just on a whim because I go
there all the time Who am I kidding and
they had it's not quite washi tape but
it's really really similar all these
different tapes for a dollar and it's I
mean they're huge rolls it's not like
it's a tiny amount and they were such
cute fabrics fabrics
I mean patterns so I got those to
decorate my planner slash anything else
and then these are at Target on
clearance these are scotch brand washi
tape and watching tape I don't really
know what what differentiates washi tape
from any other but on this is they're
usually look a little more see-through
they're re stickable because they're not
too sticky and there's always a cute
pattern maybe this is watching it but
it's a little thicker I think then washi
tape but maybe it is it doesn't matter
these are adorable and they were like a
dollar Target the Scotch ones they're
like three or four and I got them on
clearance to hug girl for like a dollar
fifty anyway so I've been really into
that and so I bought like little
stickers to put on them these have
little cute like little owls and stuff
this was a dollar at michaels for the
whole pack some might post it full
adhesive ones so they're not like
flipped up when i put them in my planner
um all kinds of stuff these little like
clip things I got at and and hair on
them these were from OfficeMax and
they're just like little tabs the clip
it and six out so you can write on it if
you're wanting to organize on your own
you know that works for anything I'm
actually using that in my portfolio as a
teacher
so that works out well anyway so all
kinds of stuff I bought these new pens
they're the Z grip flight pens that I
have fallen in love with they're not gel
pens they're regular pens but they
almost are like gel but they're not cuz
it's hard to describe I'm really picky I
like when they write thick like fat do
you know what I mean
I don't like scratchy or ultrafine i
think kitty cat there's a cat that lives
in my neighborhood that looks like a
freakin Lynx like his tails like fat and
thick and he just looks big like that
cat is a Lynx or a bobcat I it's bizarre
it's very bizarre and even what he sees
me may take that anyway very bizarre fat
fat cat anyway love these pens but they
don't write on washi tape well so I'm so
on the hunt for like maybe more marker
type pens to do for that that is besides
the point though so I talked about that
oh my gosh where man okay another Beauty
favorite Wow I'm just jumping all around
is the NYX single eyeshadow and SOS oh
my gosh first of all I showed on my haul
there's like a little bow on the
packaging it's so cute and this color is
just the perfect gray taupe color is
that not absolutely perfect
oh I wiped it right on that primer it
made like a paste
I really like these I don't typically
buy single shadows cuz I'm like okay
I've got palette I just don't really
need but if it's a color that I know I'm
gonna use like crazy then I will and
this is one that I've been using in the
crease I think I use it in the crease
today isn't it just nice and subtle you
guys know me subtle Queen here alright
another favorite of mine is this twisted
silver necklace I can't stop wearing it
you guys I really can't I really can't I
just love that it's it's got all these
little intricate details it doesn't
match like I love that and I think this
is called their karma necklace and I
just can't stop I just can't stop I'll
link it below it's funny because when I
looked at I was like I don't really
think that that's really my style like
but I thought you know what I really
like it though there's something about
it and now I really can't stop wearing
it I get so many compliments on it cuz
it matches with you can really wear it
mostly like gold and brassy but you can
rock it with silver I mean just mix some
metals with this sucker
you can layer it with another necklace
like it's stupid I love it alright what
else what else
oh this purse that I got I got an
admirer but it's a Jessica Simpson bag
it was on sale for like $20 maybe even
15 I don't know but is this not adorable
it's just a crossbody it's got the
silver length which I don't usually get
silver but I've been kind of liking it
lately and it has this fun little fringy
thing and then what I love is the size
of it it's the perfect small size it
opens up and on the inside it's polka
dotted and there's like a zipper pocket
and then on this side there's like slots
for cards and stuff and then my favorite
detail is this part that folds over
unzips and opens and it opens all the
way to the very bottom of the purse so
it's like a huge hidden compartment
perfect for hiding tampons you're
welcome ladies anyway and then it's also
got the little Jessica Simpson plate and
then opening in the back it seems really
well-made it's super it sits perfectly
it is not readjusted although but if I
can find this online i'll link it I
don't know if I'll be able to I don't
really know how that works because I
know Meyers only in a few states but I
love it I can't stop wearing it I
emptied it out though because I'm some
long story I've got a lot to bring to
the zoo to meet it with me today so I
had to bring up bigger purse is that
everything let's double check Oh a few
other things these are silly this bit
wider I found at Target and it this is
pretty like lavender color I'm like yep
buying that it's so dumb but and I
didn't even need a new one but I bought
it anyway because it just makes me happy
to light my candles my other one was
like red but I'm like forget it I'll pay
a dollar more to get this pre color
because I'm a sucker is that not
beautiful and then the last thing I
wanted to mention actually my mentor
teacher got me a bunch of these because
we both found out that we both love the
eucalyptus mint smell from Bath marks
it's like my that vanilla bean Noel are
like freaking yes but eucalyptus mint or
eucalyptus spearmint depending on the
line it's all the same smell oh is my
favorite and it's hers as well so she
got me this stress relief lotion it
smells so good and I use the what is it
called the sleep lotion
at my bedside but this once I've got my
own classroom of my own I am gonna have
this so I'm gonna save it but I just
wanted to mention that this smell is the
bomb she also got me like the hand
sanitizer the room spray like all kinds
of stuff but um anyway I love it I love
it I love it if you haven't smelled that
smell it's the most relaxing clean
springy but also could work for any it's
just the best now I have it in my car
all the time to like in one of those
scent portables anyway okay I think I'll
shut up now but hopefully that was
enjoyable hopefully you have well I hope
you didn't add too many things to your
shopping list
I can't watch these April favorites I
just can't because I end up adding so
much to my wish list and then buying too
much and right now there's so many new
things at the drugstore I'm like no I
don't need any more makeup but I just
can't stop anyway I hope that was
helpful and I'll catch you guys very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
