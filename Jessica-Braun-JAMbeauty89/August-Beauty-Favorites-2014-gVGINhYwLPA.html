finally I'm super late on this sorry
guys okay so it's almost fall we're
literally almost there and is it I mean
obviously fall is the best time of the
year ever and actually my best friend
just sent me an article the other day
about like top 20 things that people
that girls do in the fall and all of
them are hilarious but they're so true
like you know crunch around and leaves
in her ugg boots or buy everything
pumpkin spice or you know just all those
things it just cracked me up because boy
a lot of them are true but fall is the
best it's the best so speaking of all
this is not a makeup favorite but just a
favorite i had to mention so my favorite
like wall plug ins are glade and i
bought bath and body works i bought
Yankee can't I bought all of them but
Glade I always end up going back there
because even though they don't have as
many cents to choose from as like Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works does they just seem to give a
bigger sent throw their more inexpensive
unless you get a sale with the other
which case they kind of even out but
regardless I just end up loving them
more and I always go back they have
their fall scents out now and this is
the red apple bakery scent and they had
a pumpkin one as well but sometimes with
pumpkin it can be too much and I didn't
want I just didn't want that sent
everywhere but Apple type scents are
amazing and this one they have the glade
candle that you could smell and it is
the perfect fall Apple sent if you know
what I mean it's not just pure APPL it's
just like I don't know if it's like
cinnamon apple kinda I don't know
regardless i love it so this is like the
second pack of these I thought I really
really like it and so definitely you
should get it if you like apples and
fall because you love this them so
excited about that alright on to makeup
favorites so one of my rediscovered
favorites is the hard candy glama flage
this I completely just it got in my
concealer little bin and I just never
touched it for a long time and I have it
in light and I think they only have like
four or five shades of this and this is
the lightest one it's just a really
heavy duty concealer which is exactly
what it's marketed as it just it really
covers but at this
time it's almost moisturizing in the
weirdest way because there's some sort
of like oil in it or something and it
almost feels moitra moisturizing instead
of looking weird and cakey now this i
usually use just with my fingers and
i'll just use like my ring finger to Pat
it in until it looks just kind of
flawless I don't I don't love it with a
brush so I usually just do my fingers of
the brush I can never seem to get it
quite right so I just love it it's
really i think it's like six bucks or
something at walmart i just love it I'm
so excited I just like rediscover that
my favorite lip gloss this month as
we're transitioning into fall is this
one and I'm wearing it today it's just a
really kind of simple understated lip
gloss and the brain is bellapierre and I
think I got this in a boxy charm or
something like that but the shade is
vanilla pink and it's got this really
kind of nice vanilla sponge cake tight
sent but it's a really just nice normal
color that's what I liked about it and I
don't really have any this is kind of
almost a brown tone lip gloss and I
really don't have many like this if any
so it's kind of a first remember I
really like it and it smells good too
alright what else I also owe you guys
the Loreal voluminous mascara I forgot
about this and I've been mentioning it
now lately because oh my gosh it's so
good i just bought another one of these
for when it runs out so i have it the
next day because it's so good i just get
the regular i don't get the carbon black
or any of that I just like the original
and this is in blackest black and it's
just got a nice big ol wand and it holds
your curl like all day I've suddenly
been getting compliments on my eyelashes
and I haven't gotten compliments on them
it's so long and I think it's because
this really does make a difference out
of all the mascaras I've tried this is
the best one hands down I love it whoa
okay next favorite is the Rimmel stay
matte powder now I usually use it the
transparent shade but i've been using
004 sandstorm and it's kind of been
perfect at like you know after you put
your foundation on and you kind of look
at yourself and you're like like it
needs a little something more
more coverage but you don't want to take
on more foundation this has been doing
the trick perfectly because it doesn't
look like a mask let me rephrase it
doesn't look like dry and weirdly Matt
it's just the perfect amount and gets
rid of oil without looking just powdery
oh I love it and this is super
inexpensive site for five bucks another
favorite of mine is this star looks
liner I feel like it's been a favorite
every month but every time I'm looking
to see okay what did I love this month
this is always one of them I just wear
it on my lower lash line and it's not
really that obvious which is what I like
about it but it's just this really
pretty like almost emerald green with a
gold shimmer to it and it just looks
really nice and understated but it still
adds a little bit of a pop of color when
you're up close and I just love it lasts
all day and it's such a smooth formula
oh I love it and the packaging is so
sleek it's very very much like Max
packaging two more favorites so
foundation wise I've been loving this
this is the Rev on age-defying firming
and lifting makeup and I have it in the
shade bear buff which is number ten it's
a little dark I don't this might be the
latest the lightest shade I don't know
but unfortunately when it comes to
winter time I don't think I'll be able
to wear this but right now it's worked
and I'm gonna find it with my Sigma flat
top kabuki brush and that so far has
been my favorite mode of application for
this and I love that it's got a pump it
has SPF of 15 and I just like the way it
looks it just kind of just evens out my
face and gives a good amount of coverage
I would say this is medium coverage but
again it doesn't look cakey and then
when i pair it with my Rimmel stay matte
I just really like the way it's very
natural and very lifelike but your skin
still breathing so it's sort of doing
but not quite it's just that perfect
balance like a satin finish and my last
favorite is what I'm wearing right now
which is this kimono and i bought it was
so inexpensive on shop lately i wish i
could remember how much it was but it
was literally I wish I could remember if
I remember the Pricer if I find it I'll
put it below but i'll put the link for
the site as well shop lately is one of
my favorites and I always go through
phases where all by a lot of stuff from
and then I'll just kind of not for a
while and then I buy a bunch of stuff
from them and then I don't for a while
but I love it in this kimono I'll put a
picture as well it's the perfect length
it's the perfect weight I love the
pattern and it's just comfortable and
kimonos I mean of course it's on a real
kimono but kimonos are one of those kind
of fashionable things right now that I
wasn't so sure about and then I found
this one and I was like this is exactly
what I wanted it's not so much that it's
like looks weird when you're out and
about you know I really I just I just
love it I was so excited to find one
that was just perfect so and they had
quite a few patterns on there for really
cheap so like i said i'll put that below
because i just can't stop raving and
ranting about it raining and raining
anyway so oh one last favorite my okay
you guys know I love erin condren so
much this is my new favorite and this is
they're just they're not there planner
it's just there on the go notebook
simplest pie it's just lying pages but I
love this pattern I kind of wish I'd
gotten my life planner in this pattern
I'll have to in the future but I just I
just love it is that not absolutely
adorable and you know like I said all it
is is lying page and then it does have
some stickers in it like usual in the
folder as well and things like that but
I just love the pattern to be honest and
I've just been taking it to and from
work with me just making all my lists of
things I need to get done and throwing
post-it notes all over the place but
it's nice to have all my to-do lists in
one cuz usually I right like some on
posted on some on loose paper some in
notebooks but now I just this has become
my go-to so I right all my to-do lists
in here anyway so those are all my
August favorites hopefully that was
helpful for you guys I'd love to know
what years were or maybe even your
September favorites because we are
totally in September already but anyway
I'll get you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
