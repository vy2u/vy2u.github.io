this sorry guys okay so it's almost fall
we're literally almost there and is it I
mean obviously fall is the best time of
the year ever and actually my best
friend just sent me an article the other
day about like top 20 things that people
that girls do in the fall and all of
them are hilarious but they're so true
like you know crunch around and leaves
in their uh boots or buy everything
pumpkin spice or you know just all those
things that just cracked me up because
boy a lot of them are true but fall is
the best it's the best
so speaking of fall this is not a makeup
favorite but just a favorite I had to
mention so my favorite like wall plugins
are Glade and I bought Bath and Body
Works I bought Yankee can I bought all
of them but Glade I always end up going
back there because even though they
don't have as many cents to choose from
as like Bath and Body Works does they
just seem to give a bigger scent throw
they're more inexpensive unless you get
a sale with the other in which case they
kind of even out but regardless I just
end up loving them more and I always go
back they have their false sense out now
and this is the red apple bakery scent
and they had a pumpkin one as well but
sometimes a pumpkin it can be too much
and I didn't want I just didn't want
that scent everywhere but Apple type
scents are amazing and this one they
have the Glade candle that you could
smell and it is the perfect fall apple
scent if you know what I mean it's not
just pure apple it's just like I don't
know if it's like a cinnamon apple kinda
I don't know regardless I love it so
this is like the second pack of these
I've bought I really really like it and
so definitely you should get it if you
like apples and fall because you'll love
this one so excited about that alright
on to makeup favorites so one of my
rediscovered favorites is the hard candy
glamoflauge this I completely just it
got in my concealer little bin and I
just never touched it for a long time
and I have it in light and I think they
only have like four or five shades of
this and this is the lightest one it's
just a really heavy duty concealer which
is exactly what it's marketed as it just
it really covers but
the same time it's almost moisturizing
in the weirdest way because there's some
sort of like oil in it or something and
it almost feels moisture moisturizing
instead of looking weird and cakey now
this I usually use just with my fingers
and I'll just use like my ring finger to
Pat it in until it looks just kind of
flawless I don't I don't love it with a
brush so I usually just do my fingers
with a brush I can never seem to get it
quite right so I just love it it's
really I think it's like six bucks or
something at Walmart I just love it I'm
so excited I just like rediscovered that
my favorite lip gloss this month as
we're transitioning into fall is this
one and I'm wearing it today it's just a
really kind of simple understated lip
gloss and the brand is bellapierre
and I think I got this in a boxy charm
or something like that but the shade is
vanilla pink and it's got this really
kind of nice vanilla II sponge cake type
scent but it's a really just nice normal
color that's what I liked about it and I
don't really have any this is kind of
almost a brown tone lip gloss and I
really don't have many like this if any
so it's kind of a first for moomer I
really like it and it smells good too
alright what else I also owe you guys
the l'oreal voluminous mascara I forgot
about this and I've been mentioning it
now lately because oh my gosh it's so
good I just bought another one of these
for when it runs out so I have it the
next day because it's so good I just get
the regular I don't get the carbon black
or any of that I just like the original
and this is in blackest black and it's
just got a nice big ol wand and it holds
your curl like all day I've suddenly
been getting compliments on my eyelashes
not even gotten compliments on them and
so long and I think it's because this
really does make a difference out of all
the mascaras I've tried this is the best
one hands down I love it woah okay next
favorite is the Rimmel stay matte powder
now I usually use it the transparent
shade but I've been using 0:04 sandstorm
and it's kind of been perfect at like
you know after you put your foundation
on and you kind of look at yourself and
you're like like it needs a little
something more
more coverage but you don't want to take
on more foundation this has been doing
the trick perfectly because it doesn't
look like a mask but let me rephrase it
doesn't look like dry and weirdly matte
it's just the perfect amount and gets
rid of oil without looking just powdery
oh whoa I love it and this is super
inexpensive it's like four five bucks
another favorite of mine is this
starlooks liner I feel like it's been a
favorite every month but every time I'm
looking to see okay what did I love this
month this is always one of them I just
wear it on my lower lash line and it's
not really that obvious which is what I
like about it but it's just this really
pretty like almost emerald green with
the gold shimmer to it
and it just looks really nice and
understated but it still adds a little
bit of a pop of color when you're up
close and I just love it lasts all day
and it's such a smooth formula oh I love
it and the packaging is so sleek and
it's very very much like Mac's packaging
two more favorites so foundation wise
I've been loving this this is the Revlon
age defying Fermi and lifting makeup and
I have it in the shade bare buff which
is number 10 it's a little dark I don't
this might be the latest the lightest
shade I don't know
but unfortunately when it comes to
winter time I don't think I'll be able
to wear this but right now it's worked
and I'm gonna find it with my sigma flat
top kabuki brush and that so far has
been my favorite mode of application for
this and I love that it's got a pump it
has SPF of 15 and I just like the way it
looks it just kind of just evens out my
face and gives a good amount of coverage
I would say this is medium coverage but
again it doesn't look cakey and then
when I pair it with my Rimmel stay matte
I just really like the way it's very
natural and very lifelike but your skin
so breathing so it's sort of doing but
not quite it's just that perfect balance
like a satin finish and my last favorite
is what I'm wearing right now which is
this kimono and I bought it it was so
inexpensive on shop lately I wish I
could remember how much it was but it
was literally I wish I could remember if
I remember the price or if I find it
I'll put it below but I'll put the link
for the site as well shop laylee is one
of my favorites and I always go through
phases where I'll buy a lot of stuff
from them
and then I'll just kind of not for a
while and then I buy a bunch of stuff
from them and then I don't for a while
but I love it in this kimono I'll put a
picture as well it's the perfect length
it's the perfect weight I love the
pattern and it's just comfortable and
kimonos I mean of course it's not a real
kimono but kimonos are one of those kind
of fashionable things right now that I
wasn't so sure about and then I found
this one and I was like this is exactly
what I wanted it's not so much that it's
like looks weird when you're out and
about you know I really I just I just
love it I was so excited to find one
that was just perfect so and they have
quite a few patterns on there for really
cheap so like I said I'll put that below
because I just can't stop raving and
ranting about it ranting and raving
anyway so oh one last favorite my okay
you guys know I love Erin Condren so
much this is my new favorite and this is
they're just they're not there planner
it's just their on-the-go notebook
simple as pie it's just lying pages but
I love this pattern I kind of wish I got
my life planner in this pattern I'll
have to in the future but I just I just
love it is that not absolutely adorable
and you know like I said all it is is
line pages and then it does have some
stickers in it like usual in the folder
as well and things like that but I just
love the pattern to be honest and I've
just been taking it to and from work
with me just making all my lists of
things I need to get done and throwing
post-it notes all over the place but
it's nice to have all my to-do lists in
one because usually I write like some on
post-it notes some on loose papers some
in notebooks but now I've just this has
become my go-to so I write all my to-do
lists in here anyway so those are all my
August favorites hopefully that was
helpful for you guys I'd love to know
what yours were or maybe even your
September favorites because we are
totally in September already but anyway
I'll get you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
