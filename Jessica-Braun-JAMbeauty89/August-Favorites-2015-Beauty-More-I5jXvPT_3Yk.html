got my August favorites to share with
you guys I am so excited I've got a ton
of makeup products are kind of new to me
that I'm excited to share but I also
have one non beauty item that I wanted
to mention as well so let's go ahead and
get into it so the first thing I want to
mention is a laundry item this company
is called crystal wash and they
contacted me a while back ago and said
we'd love to be featuring one of your
videos and I was like I don't know so
Tyler and I we always talked about
things like that and we were researching
and looking this up and it really
sounded kind of cool and I was like
alright so a while later I finally
responded and said ok that's fine so
they gave me a 20% off link below
definitely check it out if you're
interested but let me tell you about
them so you're hearing something
it's these and basically when you order
it set there I think their regular price
is $50 but with the 20% off that'd be 10
it'd be like 40 it's kind of expensive
at first but then when you think about
it this is supposed to last a thousand
loads of laundry and basically this is
supposed to wash your clothes the way
like a detergent would however like for
us we used to use like the scoop
detergent and then we switched over to
like it's a little pods because it was
just easier we could just toss one in
except for that gets really pricey too I
mean really pricey so it was just all
getting really expensive and that's why
when we kind of looked it up we were
like maybe though so basically all you
have to do in this blue both of our
minds when we tried it you put your
clothes in and then if you want to use
like what's it called if you want to use
like softener or fabric softener you can
put that in as well to do like that job
but this is just for the cleaning
portion so you literally just stick both
of them in to your load and then you
wash clothes and it gets them clean and
there was a stain and this shirt I don't
remember what it was I'd say it was food
of course it wasn't such a mess anyway
um in it see my shirt and it came out
and you stain remover and they do say
you can so you stay in remover like if
it's a really set insane but it cleaned
that off on its own so that blew my mind
but when I thought was kind of cool is
like how environmentally friendly it was
because what they say is every 30 washes
these are supposed to last a thousand
washes they say every 30 washes you're
supposed to sit it put in like in the
Sun for a while and then it like almost
like recharges the little pellets in
here I don't know the science behind it
but it they they have a description of
it on their website it's pretty cool but
yeah it recharges them and then you can
use them again another 30 washes up to a
thousand washes so thinking about how
many loads you're supposed to get out of
like typical detergent I mean this is
like $300 versus I guess 40 with my
discount code so I don't know I think
it's really cool this is what we've been
using now for about two weeks and I look
at we've got some of our like pods left
and I look at them and I think that is
so much money we've wasted because this
we're just saving so much money it's
crazy so I'm so excited this might be
something that I'm thinking about
getting people could be a weird
Christmas gift but I feel like like I'm
thinking of my sisters that have kids
that are doing tons of laundry how much
money this would save them too so that's
something I'm thinking about anyway but
like I said there is that link below if
you are interested because it's you know
save ten bucks if you are thinking about
it and if not well and no harm though so
now let's get onto the makeup so the
very first thing I want to mention this
is something that it kind of sat in my
collection if you saw my gorgeous
cosmetics haul I did a couple months ago
they sent me a bunch of stuff and I just
showed it on there just to show you guys
because I'd never heard of any of it um
this foundation is the best foundation
I've ever used like I wish I had this
for my wedding day and I loved the
foundation I used but this I this is the
best foundation I've ever used like I
cannot use anything else anything that I
thought was my favorite just got wiped
out of the way I it is the gorgeous
cosmetics base perfect liquid foundation
this stuff when I put it on its got like
a little pump and when I put it on I you
know just kind of dot it everywhere and
then I
rub it in from the inside out with them
like a foundation brush it is instantly
flawless I never need a second layer
although sometimes I'll put a second
layer here because I've got like
freckles and hyperpigmentation just a
little bit so I'll put a little extra
there but it's crazy high coverage but
it looks so light like it doesn't look
like you're wearing a cake of makeup
because that was my problem with like
the SA Lauder Double Wear I it was like
wow that's great coverage but for me it
didn't feel comfortable to wear and I
just felt like I was breaking out and
just you know all that I've been wearing
this for about three weeks now it's not
broken me out I just it look your skin
doesn't look matte but it doesn't look
shiny it's that perfect satin finish and
it just stays put it doesn't move all
day I don't use this with the primer I
don't use it with the setting spray I
just use it and on its own with my skin
tight which I'm I would say I'm pretty
much normal I've got just normal skin
it's never too oily and it gets a little
drier in the winter so normal to dry
this works amazingly
if you've used this and you do have like
really oily skin I'd love to know down
below how it works for you like if it
does stay put for you as well I would
say if you have oily skin and you did
want to do this try it with a primer
that you know really works well with
your skin and it probably worked better
I can't believe how amazing this stuff
is better than the HD foundation for
makeup forever better than my Revlon
Colorstay whipped which you know I love
better than the Rimmel one that I love
this is amazing okay I'll shut up next
thing some drugstore things what I'm
wearing on my lips right now is the
favorite this is the wet and wild 903 C
lipstick and the shade is actually
called just peachy and it's just this
peachy tone lipstick you can see it on
my lips today the megalast lipsticks are
so drying at first because like they
kind of pull at your lips to get them on
but once you've got them on and you
really kind of fill in the gaps they're
so beautiful and they really do stay put
and for a dollar ninety-nine or I want
to say if they're two or three dollars
it's so worth the price because of the
color punch alone but I usually because
it is a drier formula I'll typically
wear something over it and this is
another favorite this is the NYC liquid
lip shine
in Brighton Beach peach and I love it
again a really shimmery peachy colored
lipstick or lip gloss but it's so I
don't know it's like got this beautiful
metallic sheen to it but it's not too
much and they have this nice kind of
caramel even illah scent to it I just
love these two together I love both of
these separately they're just absolutely
beautiful and so so cheap okay the next
favorite is I just got this and I
already know I'm wearing safe the blush
I'm wearing this is from makeup geek and
I have never I just placed my first
makeup geek order the other day never
tried any other stuff other than some
eyeshadows the subscribers sent and I
loved them which is why I placed the
order
so this blush is in secret admirer and
it's like kind of lilac pink like a
purplish pink it first of all they're
crazy pigmented but they're actually
blendable so I've got a little swatch
there but they blend beautifully they do
not budge when I put this on I had like
our back-to-school night at school and I
put it on in the morning and I thought I
was gonna have time to go home I didn't
so I had no I wanted to touch up but I
didn't have blush it was it stayed on it
just stayed on and it was you know from
5:00 in the morning until probably about
8:00 at night it just looked same way it
did in the morning it was so amazing so
that is how I knew I was like I've got
to tell you guys about this because
that's what we're all looking for in a
blush a blush that just stays put
it doesn't like start looking patchy it
just stays the way you put it on
beautifully and I love this shade secret
admirer now see now I want to try other
ones but this is one that I love these
kinds of blush shades
so another favorite now this one's a
Laura Geller one so it's just a little
bit pricier that's kind of the downside
so this is their baked highlighter duo I
was wanting to buy their baked
highlighter in French vanilla because
it's kind of like a satiny highlighter
it's not shimmery but it's got that nice
satin glow well this one was the duo so
it's got French vanilla right here and
then on the side that's really shimmery
it's called Portofino so you can blend
them together and get a really pretty
highlight that's kind of hard to see but
then you can get just the French vanilla
which is beautiful right here and then
you could get just Portofino and so
you've got three different
shades of the highlighter which i think
is amazing and I mean that alone is kind
of worth the price so for me when I'm
traveling I always end up bringing more
than one highlighter cause I'm like well
sometimes I want more of a shimmery and
sometimes I want more of just a glowy
this is both so it's like a dream so I'm
I'm excited to travel with it I know
that we're going to London over
Christmas and I'm I'm probably gonna
bring this with me just because it's so
multi-purpose I say that now I'll
probably change my mind ten thousand
times anyway but it's amazing so another
favorite this is a Milani product and
it's their shadow eyes in the shade
almond cream I have been using this
non-stop I used it today right under my
brow I just took the pencil and just
kind of drew it and then just patted it
in and blended it to sharpen my brow
line but not only that I'll use this
just instead of my Mac Paint Pot in
painterly which is like the same color
but you know I put the cream shadow all
over to kind of neutralize that area and
then it'll work kind of as a shadow
primer well I've been using this as a
shadow primer so I'll just draw a little
bit and then blend it all in all over my
eyelid and all the way up to my brow
bone and it holds onto the shadow
beautifully these are so inexpensive it
lasts a long time and it's not gonna dry
out as quickly as like a Paint Pot would
in my opinion because it's just it's a
different format but it's so so creamy I
was constantly shocked about creamy
this's love that one
alright so this is another new one to me
this is the Sonia Kashuk brightening
powder and it was I want to say it's a
little over ten dollars at Target is
where Sonia Kashuk is sold and you can
also buy it on targets website this is
like it's like a finely milled loose
white powder but it's got little flecks
of glitter and usually that turns me off
because I tried the elf one that a lot
of people love and again you guys know I
love elf but that one for whatever
reason I just didn't love it this the
glitter and it is so nicely milled that
disrupt it that it just kind of I don't
know it blends and looks correct like it
just looks right so I'm wearing this
today as well and it just really
brightens that area so even if you're
using a concealer that's not great I
feel like this does a great job of
setting it but also brightening
so it makes it look even better than it
did so I really really like this stuff
and this is the only white under eye
setting powder that I'm using the other
ones I have have more of like a nude
tone or whatever but this one it's the
only way what I'm actually really light
so I'm really excited about that and I
have a couple more favorites there were
a lot this month this is the Maybelline
quad and chai latte this is one that a
lot of people talked about a couple
years ago and I had never tried it and I
heard someone mention it in like a
decluttering video I think they kept it
but they were mentioning it and I was
like I forgot about that quad and I
never tried it and then I thought I
wonder if they even still sell it and
they do it's just before it was in a
different format and now they have it in
the format they use now but it's got
these beautiful shades where it's got
this deep brown with a little bit of
glitter and I use that that's all I'm
wearing on my eyes this quad I didn't
bring anything else into it so I've got
this dark brown lining my eye on the
bottom I've got this light color all
over then I used the kind of amber color
or like we're almost like a rose gold
color all over my lid as well and in the
crease and then I also used this kind of
matte taupe color in my crease as well
so all of that blended together I think
is a really nice look it's great for
everyday it's great if you you know have
a job where you want some you can touch
up as well you can still use the little
sponge applicators to you know line your
eyes or even I mean it works well a lot
of people only use these and I think
people forget that they're useful so um
yeah I really really like it do I think
these shadows are like the most buttery
most pigmented things in the world
absolutely not I mean if you swipe this
compared to like the lorac Pro it's like
90 day but do I still think they do a
nice look and that they're usable just
as well yes and frankly sometimes these
shadows are more useful because they're
not as pigmented right off the bat so
you don't have to worry about screwing
it up too much which I really like so I
love that quad I have another quad in
mocha motion the same Maybelline brand
that I really like as well and it's just
got just very similar tones but a little
more gray toned I would say okay so
another favorite blew me away I had a
lot of subscribers sent me they unique
little like mascara
where you do like the fibers and stuff
and I've always been like no so I
finally was like I'm just gonna try it
why am I being such a weirdo about it so
I tried it and I was like what like it
actually works
so that blew my mind I could not so
basically you get two things the
transplanting gel and the fibers and you
put the transplanting gel which is
essentially like a mascara it's black
you put that on first then you put on
the fibers and the fiber comes like on
like this like almost straight wand and
they're black fibers for some reason I
thought they'd be white and like no
that's gonna show through they're black
so then it kind of goes on and they look
all feathery and kind of cool then you
use that same transplanting gel like the
black mascara back over it's kind of
like settle it in so it's kind of like
sandwich again the fibers I thought it'd
be hard to work with I thought it'd be I
mean I had a lot of I was just
prejudging it a lot it was so easy to do
it took me really only a little bit
longer than just regular mascara cuz I'm
usually putting on a few coats of it
anyway and it does really well I'm
wearing it today and I really like the
way it makes my lashes look they're
really soft they don't feel you know
weird or crunchy I don't notice like
flaking all over the place
it's just I was really impressed so I
know they have another this is their
original formula I know they have
another like a 3d formula I haven't
tried that yet but I really liked this
so those are all my favorites hopefully
