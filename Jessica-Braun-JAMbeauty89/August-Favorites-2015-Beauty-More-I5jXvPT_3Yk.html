got my August favorites to share with
you guys I'm so excited I've got a ton
of makeup products are kind of new to me
that I'm excited to share but I also
have one non beauty item that I wanted
to mention as well so let's go ahead and
it into it so the first thing I want to
mention is a laundry item this company
is called crystal wash and they
contacted me a while back ago and said
we'd love to be featuring one of your
videos and I was like I don't know so
Tyler and I we always talk about things
like that and we were researching and
looking this up and it really sounded
kind of cool and I was like alright so a
while later I finally responded and said
ok that's fine so they gave me a twenty
percent off link below definitely check
it out if you're interested but let me
tell you about them so you're hearing
something it's these and basically when
you order it set there I think their
regular price is fifty dollars but with
the twenty percent off of every time
it'd be like 40 um it's kind of
expensive at first but then when you
think about it this is supposed to last
a thousand loads of laundry and
basically this is supposed to wash your
clothes the way like a detergent would
however like for us we used to use like
the scoop detergent and then we switch
over to like the little pods because it
was just easier we could just toss one
in except for that gets really pricey
too i mean really pricey so it was just
all getting really expensive and that's
why when we kind of looked it up we were
like maybe though so basically all you
have to do in this blue both of our
minds and we tried it you put your
clothes in and then if you want to use
like what's it called if you want to use
like softener fabric softener you can
put that in as well to do like that job
but this is just for the cleaning
portion so you literally just stick both
of them in to your load and then you
wash clothes and it gets them clean and
there was a stain and this shirt I don't
remember what it was I'd say it was food
of course it was such a mess anyway um
in it see my shirt and it came right out
even you stain remover and they do say
you can so you stay in remover like if
it's a really set insane but it cleaned
that off on its own so that blew my mind
but when I thought was kind of cool is
like how environmentally
leah was because what they say is every
30 washes these are supposed to last a
thousand washes they say every 30 washes
you're supposed to sit it put in like in
the Sun for a while and then it like
almost like recharges the little pellets
in here I don't know the science behind
it but they they have a description of
it on their website it's pretty cool but
um yeah it recharges them and then you
can use them again another 30 washes up
to a thousand washes so thinking about
how many loads you're supposed to get
out of like typical detergent I mean
this is like three hundred dollars
versus I guess 40 with my discount code
so i don't know i think it's really cool
this is what we've been using now for
about two weeks and i look at we've got
some of our like pods left and I look at
them and I think that is so much money
we've wasted because this it we're just
saving so much money it's crazy so I'm
so excited this might be something that
I'm thinking about getting people kind
of you weird Christmas gift but I feel
like like I'm thinking of my sisters
that have kids that are doing tons of
laundry how much money this would save
them too so that's something I'm
thinking about anyway but like I said
there is that link below if you are
interested because it's you know save 10
bucks if you are thinking about it and
if not well and no harm though so now
let's get on to the makeup so the very
first thing i want to mention this is
something that if kind of sat in my
collection if you saw my gorgeous
cosmetics hall i did a couple months ago
they send me a bunch of stuff and i just
showed it on there just to show you guys
because i'd never heard of any of it um
this foundation is the best foundation
I've ever use like I wish I had this for
my wedding day and i love the foundation
i used but this I this is the best
foundation I've ever used like I cannot
use anything else anything that I
thought was my favorite just got wiped
out of the way I it is the gorgeous
cosmetics base perfect liquid foundation
this stuff when I put it on it's got
with a little pump and when I put it on
I you know just kind of dot it
everywhere and then I just rub it in
from the inside out with a like a
foundation brush it is instantly
flawless I never need a second layer
although sometimes I'll put a second
layer here because I've got like
freckles and hyperpigmentation just a
little bit so i'll put a little extra
there but it's crazy high coverage
it looks so light like it doesn't look
like you're wearing a cake of makeup
because that was my problem with like
the estee lauder double wear it was like
wow that's a great coverage but for me
it didn't feel comfortable to wear and I
just felt like I was breaking out and
just you know all that I've been wearing
this for about three weeks now it's not
broken me out um I just it look your
skin doesn't look Matt but it doesn't
look shiny it's that perfect satin
finish and it just stays put it doesn't
move all day I don't use this with the
primer I don't use with the setting
spray I just use it and on its own with
my skin tight which I'm i would say I'm
pretty much normal I've got just normal
skin it's never too oily and it gets a
little drier in the winter so normal to
dry this works amazingly if you've used
this and you do have like really oily
skin I'd love to know down below how it
works for you like if it does stay put
for you as well I would say if you have
oily skin and you did want to do this
try it with a primer that you know
really works well with your skin and
probably work better I can't believe how
amazing this stuff is better than the HD
foundation for mega forever better than
my revlon colorstay with which you know
I love better than the Rimmel one that I
love this is amazing okay I'll shut up
next thing some drug store things what
I'm wearing on my lips right now is a
favorite this is the wet and wild 903
see lipstick and the shade is actually
called just peachy and it's just this
peachy tone lipstick you can see it on
my lips today the mega last lipsticks
are so drying at first because like they
kind of pull at your lips to get them on
but once you've got them on and you
really kind of fill in the gaps they're
so beautiful and they really do stay put
and for a dollar ninety-nine or I want
to save their two or three dollars it's
so worth the price because of the color
punch alone but I usually because it is
a dryer formula I'll typically wear
something over it and this is another
favorite this is the NYC liquid lip
shine in Brighton Beach peach and I love
it again a really shimmery peachy color
lipstick or lip gloss but it's so I
don't know it's like got this beautiful
metallic sheen to it but it's not too
much and they have this nice kind of
caramel even illa sent to it
I just love these two together I love
both of these separately they're just
absolutely beautiful and so so cheap ok
the next favorite is I just got this and
i already know i'm wearing today it's
the blush i'm wearing this is from
makeup geek and i have never i just
placed my first makeup geek order the
other day never tried any other stuff
other than some eye shadows of
subscribers sent and i love them which
is why i place the order so this blush
is in secret admirer and it's like kind
of lilac pink like a purplish pink um it
first of all they're crazy pigmented but
they're actually blendable so I've got a
little swatch there but they blend
beautifully they do not budge when I put
this on i had like our back-to-school
night at school and I put it on in the
morning and I thought I was gonna have
time to go home I didn't so I had no I
wanted to touch up but I didn't have
blush it was it stayed on it just stayed
on and it was you know from five in the
morning until probably about eight at
night it just looked same way did in the
morning it was so amazing so that is how
I knew I was like I've got to tell you
guys about this because that's what
we're all looking for in a blush a blush
that just stays put it doesn't like
start looking patchy it just stays the
way you put it on beautifully and I love
this shade secret admirer now see now I
want to try other ones but this is one
that I love these kinds of blush shades
so another favorite now this one's a
laura geller one so it's just a little
bit pricier that's kind of the downside
so this is their baked highlighter duo I
was wanting to buy their baked
highlighter in french vanilla because
it's kind of like a satiny highlighter
it's not shimmery but it's got that nice
satin glow well this one was the duo so
it's got french vanilla right here and
then on the side that's really shimmery
it's called portofino so you can blend
them together and get a really pretty
highlight that's kind of hard to see but
then you can get just the french vanilla
which is beautiful right here and then
you could get just portofino and so
you've got three different shades of the
highlighter which i think is amazing and
i mean that alone is kind of worth the
price so for me when I'm traveling I
always end up bringing more than one
highlighters I'm like well sometimes I
want
more of a shimmery and sometimes I want
more of just a glowy this is both so
it's like a dream so I'm I'm excited to
travel with it I know that we're going
to London over Christmas and I'm I'm
probably going to bring this with me
just because it's so multi-purpose I say
that now i'll probably change my mind
10,000 times anyway but it's amazing so
another favorite this is a Milani
product and it's their shadow eyes in
the shade almond cream I have been using
this non-stop I used it today right
under my brow I just took the pencil and
just kind of drew it and then just
patted it in and blended it to sharpen
my brow line but not only that all uses
just instead of my Mac Paint Pot in
painterly which is like the same color
but you know I put the cream shadow all
over to kind of neutralize that area and
then it'll work kind of as a shadow
primer well I've been using this as a
shadow primer so I'll just draw a little
bit and then blend it all in all over my
eyelid and all the way up to my brow
bone and it holds onto the shadow
beautifully these are so inexpensive it
lasts a long time and it's not going to
dry out as quickly as like a Paint Pot
would in my opinion because it's just
it's a different format but it's so so
creamy I was constantly shocked about
creamy this is love that one um all
right so this is another new one to me
this is the Sonia Kashuk brightening
powder and it was I want to save us a
little over ten dollars at target is
where Sonia Kashuk is sold you can also
buy it on targets website this is like
it's like a finely milled loose white
powder but it's got little flecks of
glitter and usually that turns me off
because I tried the elf one that a lot
of people love and again you guys know I
love out but that one for whatever
reason I just didn't love it this the
glitter and it is so nicely milled that
um dropped it that it just kind of I
don't know it blends and looks correct
like it just looks right so I'm wearing
this today as well and it just really
brightens that area so even if you're
using a concealer that's not great I
feel like this does a great job of
setting it but also brightening it so it
makes it look even better than it did
so I really really like this stuff and
this is the only white under I setting
powder that i'm using the other ones i
have have more of like a nude tone or
whatever but this one it's the only why
what I've actually really liked so I'm
really excited about that and I have a
couple more favors there were a lot this
month this is the Maybelline quad and
chai latte this is one that a lot of
people talked about a couple years ago
and I had never tried it and I heard
someone mention it in like a declutter
video I think they kept it but they were
mentioning it not as like I forgot about
that quad and I never tried it and then
I thought I wonder if they even still
sell it and they do it's just before it
was in a different format and now they
have it in the format they use now but
it's got these beautiful shades where
it's got this deep brown with a little
bit of glitter and I use that on that's
all I'm wearing on my eyes this quad I
didn't bring anything else into it so
I've got this dark brown lining my eye
on the bottom I've got this light color
all over then i use the kind of amber
color or like we're almost like a rose
gold color all over my lid as well and
in the crease and then i also use this
kind of matte taupe color in my crease
as well so all of that blend together i
think is a really nice look it's great
for everyday it's great if you you know
have a job where you want some you can
touch up as well you can still use the
little sponge applicator see you know
lie your eyes or even I mean it works
well a lot of people only use these and
I think people forget that they're
useful so um yeah I really really like
it do i think these shadows are like the
most buttery most pigmented things in
the world absolutely not i mean if you
swipe this compared to like the lorac
pro it's like night and day but do I
still think they do a nice look and that
they're usable just as well yes and
frankly sometimes these shadows are more
useful because they're not as pigmented
right off the bat so you don't have to
worry about screwing it up too much
which I really like so I love that quad
I have another quad and mocha motion the
same Maybelline brand that I really
liked as well and it's just got just
very similar tones but a little more
gray toned i would say um ok so another
favorite blew me away i had a lot of
subscribers send me they unique little
like mascara duo where you could do like
the fire
stuff and I've always been like no so I
finally was like I'm just gonna try it
why am I being such a weirdo about it so
I tried it and I was like what like it
actually works so that blew my mind I
could not so basically you get two
things the transplanting gel and the
fibers and you put the transplanting gel
which is essentially like a mascara it's
black you put that on first then you put
on the fibers and the fiber comes like
on like this like all straight wand and
they're black fibers for some reason I
hope they'd be white and like no that's
going to show through their black so
that it kind of goes on and they look
all feathery and kind of cool then you
use that same transplanting gel like the
black mascara um back over it's kind of
like settle it in so it's kind of like
sandwich in the fibers I thought it'd be
hard to work with I thought it'd be I
mean I had a lot of I was just
prejudging it a lot it was so easy to do
it took me really only a little bit
longer than just regular mascara because
I'm usually putting on a few coats of it
anyway and it does really well I'm
wearing it today and I really like the
way it makes my lashes look they're
really soft they don't feel you know
weird or crunchy I don't notice like
flaking all over the place it's just I
was really impressed so I know they have
another this is their original formula i
know they have another like a 3d formula
and tried that yet but i really liked
this so those are all my favorites
hopefully you enjoyed again check below
